Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolomics method was adopted to evaluate the effects of Phoenix dactylifera seeds, in particular the Algerian date variety of Deglet on the metabolome of the LPS-IFN-γ-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Variations in the extracellular and intracellular profiles emphasized the differences in the presence of , phenylalanine, alanine, proline, asparagine, isocitrate, inosine and lysine. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed noticeable clustering patterns between the treated and induced RAW cells based on the  profile of the extracellular metabolites. However, the effects of treatment on the intracellular metabolites appears to be less distinct as suggested by the PCA and heatmap analyses. A clear group segregation was observed for the intracellular metabolites from the treated and induced cells based on the orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) score plot. Likewise, 11 of the metabolites in the treated cells were significantly different from those in the induced groups, including amino acids and succinate. The enrichment analysis demonstrated that treatment with Deglet seed extracts interfered with the energy and of amino acids . Overall, the obtained data reinforced the possible application of Deglet seeds as a functional food with anti-inflammatory properties.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epigenetic mechanisms exert their prime effects in developing cells. We hypothesized that muscle insulin resistance in LBW subjects may be due to early differential epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations in their immature muscle progenitor cells. : Muscle progenitor cells were obtained from 23 healthy young adult men born at term with LBW, and 15 BMI-matched normal birth weight (NBW) controls. The cells were subsequently cultured and differentiated into myotubes. DNA and RNA were harvested before and after differentiation for genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA expression measurements. After correcting for multiple comparisons (q ≤ 0.05), 56 CpG sites were found to be significantly, differentially methylated in myoblasts from LBW compared with NBW men, of which the top five gene-annotated CpG sites () previously have been associated to regulation of cholesterol, fatty acid and glucose  and muscle development or hypertrophy. LBW men displayed markedly decreased myotube gene expression levels of the AMPK-repressing  kinase gene  and the histone deacetylase gene .

However, the characteristics of HMAs and the regulatory mechanisms between HMAs and microRNAs in wheat (Triticum aestivum L) remain unknown.By comparative microRNA and transcriptome analysis, a total three known and 19 novel differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs) and 1561 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in L17 after Cd treatment. In H17, by contrast, 12 known and 57 novel DEMs, and only 297 Cd-induced DEGs were found. Functional enrichments of DEMs and DEGs indicate how genotype-specific biological processes responded to Cd stress. Processes found to be involved in microRNAs-associated Cd response include: ubiquitin mediated proteolysis,  , and carbon fixation  and thiamine . For the mRNA response, categories including terpenoid backbone biosynthesis and phenylalanine , and photosynthesis - antenna proteins and ABC transporters were enriched. Moreover, we identified 32 TaHMA genes in wheat. Phylogenetic trees, chromosomal locations, conserved motifs and expression levels in different tissues and roots under Cd stress are presented. Finally, we infer a microRNA-TaHMAs expression network, indicating that miRNAs can regulate TaHMAs.Our findings suggest that microRNAs play important role in wheat under Cd stress through regulation of targets such as TaHMA2;1. Identification of these targets will be useful for screening and breeding low-Cd accumulation wheat lines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401901>Synthesis and enzyme-based evaluation of analogues - thiol carboxylic acid inhibitor of metallo-β-lactamase IMP-1.</a></h2><p>The emergence of drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria is occurring due to the global overuse and misuse of β-lactam antibiotics. Infections caused by some bacteria which secrete metallo-β-lactamases (enzymes that inactivate β-lactam antibiotics) are increasingly prevalent and have become a major worldwide threat to human health. These bacteria are resistant to β-lactam antibiotics and MBL-inhibitor/β-lactam antibiotic combination therapy can be a strategy to overcome this problem. So far, no clinically available inhibitors of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) have been reported.

The natural course of metastasized disease is highly heterogeneous, with an overall 5-year survival rate varying between 40% and 85%. For individual patients, overall survival, progression-free survival, and clinical outcome are difficult to predict. Management of metastasized pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma is challenging. Currently available therapeutic options are surgical debulking, treatment with radiopharmaceuticals (I-MIBG, Y and Lu-DOTATATE), chemotherapy and targeted therapy.The pathogenesis of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) is largely driven by genomic alterations in PPGL susceptibility genes related to three different clusters: altered pseudo-hypoxic signaling (cluster-1), altered MAP-kinase signaling (cluster-2) and altered Wnt signaling (cluster-3). Novel targeted therapies ( kinase inhibitors) and potential future therapeutic options, guided by improved knowledge about the oncogenic cluster 1-3 signaling , will be discussed.Treatment of metastasized pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma remains challenging. Profiling of gene expression and methylation can serve as a powerful tool for characterizing disease clusters and for guiding targeted therapy to improve selectivity and efficacy.

Recently, brexpiprazole, an antipsychotic drug, was reported to chemosensitize glioma cells to osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, by suppressing survivin, an anti-apoptotic protein, but their combinational effects on lung and pancreatic cancers remain unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the combinational effects of brexpiprazole and osimertinib on lung and pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.YM155, a suppressor of survivin, siRNA, and immunoblot were used to examine the role of survivin in osimertinib-resistance. The effect of drugs on cell viability in vitro was examined by trypan blue staining. The in vivo effects of drugs on tumor growth were examined using a xenograft mouse model.Brexpiprazole exerted combinational effects with osimertinib in vitro. Pharmacological and genetic suppression of survivin chemosensitized the cells to osimertinib. Moreover, the combination of brexpiprazole and osimertinib effectively suppressed tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model.Brexpiprazole is a promising drug for lung and pancreatic cancer in combination with osimertinib.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

We found that metformin treatment down-regulated integrin β1 concomitant with the loss of inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) in murine myocytes, adipocytes, and hepatocytes. To determine if IPMK was upstream of integrin β1 expression, we examined IPMK mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and found that integrins β1 and β3 gene expression was reduced by half, relative to wild-type cells, whereas focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity and Rho/Rac/Cdc42 protein levels were increased, resulting in migration defects. Using nanonet force microscopy, we determined that cell:extracellular matrix adhesion and cell contractility forces were decreased, confirming the functional relevance of integrin and Rho protein dysregulation. Pharmacological studies showed that inhibition of both FAK1 and proline-rich  kinase 2 partially restored integrin β1 expression, suggesting negative regulation of integrin β1 by FAK. Together our data indicate that IPMK participates in the regulation of cell migration and provides a potential link between metformin and wound healing impairment.-Tu-Sekine, B., Padhi, A., Jin, S., Kalyan, S., Singh, K., Apperson, M., Kapania, R., Hur, S.

These mutations disturb B-cell development, decrease immunoglobulin levels, increase susceptibility to infection or neoplasms, and increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). For occasional cases of CRC have been reported in XLA patients, low levels of B lymphocytes and immunoglobulins induced by congenital immune disorder make them more susceptible to drug-related toxicities (DRT). Therefore, gene sequencing, therapeutic drug monitoring and any possible measurement to predict DRT should be considered before determining the course of chemotherapy for XLA patients with CRC.In this study, we reported a 21-year-old male who developed metastatic CRC in the context of XLA. Since the whole exome sequencing and therapeutic drug monitoring did not reveal any predictive markers of DRT, we applied standard first-line chemotherapy to the patient. However, progressive disease occurred after the fifth treatment cycle. Therefore, the administration of oxaliplatin was changed to irinotecan as second-line therapy. After that, the patient firstly suffered from severe hypocalcemia and eventually died due to metastatic CRC after the eighth treatment cycle. The overall survival time was 7.5 months.This study reported the first written record of a Chinese XLA patient with metastatic CRC and severe hypocalcemia. Whole exome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis indicated the somatic mutations in ABCA6, C6 and PAX3 genes might contribute to the early-onset and metastasis CRC. Besides, a number of germline mutations in genes related to calcium  (CACNA2D4, CD36, etc.) and the administration of irinotecan were speculated to be the causes of severe hypocalcemia. We therefore suggested that in order to avoid severe DRT, clinicians should take genetic background and therapeutic drug monitoring into consideration while planning chemotherapy treatment for XLA patients with CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668688>Metabolomics of Aerobic Exercise in Chronic Stroke Survivors: A Pilot Study.</a></h2><p>Understanding the  response to exercise may aid in optimizing stroke management.

Linear models for microarray data expression analysis was performed to determine  changes over time, and Mummichog was used for pathway enrichment analysis following analysis of plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry.VOpeak change was greater following exercise than stretching (18.9% versus -.2%; P < .01). Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites results showed significant enrichment in 4  following treadmill exercise, 3 of which (heparan-, chondroitin-, keratan-sulfate degradation) involved connective tissue  and the fourth involve lipid signaling (linoleate ). More  were altered in pre and post comparisons of stretching, including branched-chain amino acid, tryptophan, , and urea cycle, which could indicate loss of lean body mass.These preliminary data show different  changes due to treadmill training and stretching in chronic stroke survivors and suggest that in addition to improved aerobic capacity, weight-bearing activity, like walking, could protect against loss of lean body mass.

Bone marrow specimens of 93 patients with MDS were collected from the General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University from September 2010 to June 2014. The enrolled subjects included 54 males and 39 females and they were divided into the low-risk group (IPSS score:0-1.0, median: 0.5) and the high-risk group (IPSS score: 1.5-3.0, median: 2.5) according to the International Prognostic Score System (IPSS). The methylation level of  was detected by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, and the level of p-STAT3 was detected using Western blot.  In the high-risk group, 64.44% (29/45) of the patients had methylation in the  promoter region, which was significantly higher than the low-risk group 22.92% (11/48). Therefore,  methylation was frequently presented in the patients of the high-risk group. Similarly, 66.67% (30/45) of the patients in the high-risk group had positive STAT3 phosphorylation status, whereas only 20.83% (10/48) were tested positive in the low-risk group. In addition, correlation analysis also revealed that the SHP-1 methylation rate was positively correlated with the positive rate of STAT3 phosphorylation (0.57,0.001).   methylation is significantly correlated with the risk of MDS patients. It may be used as an independent predictor of shorter survival in patients of the high-risk group. The increased level of  methylation will lead to the uncontrolled activation of the downstream JAK/STAT3 pathway, which in turn can cause further positive feedback to amplify the carcinogenic signal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379758>Switchable Nitroproteome States of  Biology and Pathobiology.</a></h2><p>The study demonstrates protein  nitration as a functional post-translational modification (PTM) in biology and pathobiology of the oomycete  (Mont.) de Bary, the most harmful pathogen of potato ( L.).

The role of CYPs and FMOs in the microsomal  of vandetanib to -desmethylvandetanib and vandetanib--oxide was investigated by examining the effects of CYP/FMO inhibitors and by correlating CYP-/FMO-catalytic activities in each microsomal sample with the amounts of -desmethylvandetanib/vandetanib--oxide formed by these samples. CYP3A4/FMO-activities significantly correlated with the formation of -desmethylvandetanib/ vandetanib--oxide. Based on these studies, most of the vandetanib  was attributed to -desmethylvandetanib/vandetanib--oxide to CYP3A4/FMO3. Recombinant CYP3A4 was most efficient to form -desmethylvandetanib, while FMO1/FMO3 generated -oxide. Cytochrome b stimulated the CYP3A4-catalyzed formation of -desmethylvandetanib, which is of great importance because CYP3A4 is not only most efficient in generating -desmethylvandetanib, but also most significant due to its high expression in human liver. Molecular modeling indicated that binding of more than one molecule of vandetanib into the CYP3A4-active center can be responsible for the high efficiency of CYP3A4 -demethylating vandetanib.

However, the mechanism of the therapeutic process is still not fully understood. Metabolomic technique can be used to explore the mechanisms underlying the treatment of TBI with XFZYD. The purpose of this work was to investigate the  characteristics of blood samples from rats with and without XFZYD treatment and the dynamic changes in metabolite profiles on days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 after injury (within the severe phase of TBI) based on untargeted UPLC-ESI-IT-TOF-MS analysis. Pattern recognition, clustering analysis and  pathway analysis were used to analyse the metabolomic data of three groups (a sham-operated group, a TBI model, and an XFZYD-treated TBI model). The results showed that XFZYD reversed the abnormalities in the levels of small-molecule metabolites (such as L-acetylcarnitine, L-tryptophan, indoleacrylic acid, γ-aminobutyric acid, hypotaurine, LysoPC(18:1)(11Z), creatine, L-phenylalanine and L-leucine) in TBI rats through six   (including phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis; phenylalanine ; valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis; taurine and hypotaurine ; tryptophan ; and alanine, aspartate and glutamate ) involved in the therapy process.

Viral kinases have been implicated in various diseases and are also known to acquire host kinases for mimicking cellular functions and exhibit virulence. Although substantial analyses have been reported in the literature on diversity of viral kinases, there is a gap in the understanding of sequence and structural similarity among kinases from different classes of viruses. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of protein kinases encoded in viral genomes. Homology search methods have been used to identify kinases from 104,282 viral genomic datasets. Serine/threonine and  kinases are identified only in 390 viral genomes. Out of seven viral classes that are based on nature of genetic material, only viruses having double-stranded DNA and single-stranded RNA retroviruses are found to encode kinases. The 716 identified protein kinases are classified into 63 subfamilies based on their sequence similarity within each cluster, and sequence signatures have been identified for each subfamily. 11 clusters are well represented with at least 10 members in each of these clusters. Kinases from dsDNA viruses, Phycodnaviridae which infect green algae and Herpesvirales that infect vertebrates including human, form a major group. From our analysis, it has been observed that the protein kinases in viruses belonging to same taxonomic lineages form discrete clusters and the kinases encoded in alphaherpesvirus form host-specific clusters. A comprehensive sequence and structure-based analysis enabled us to identify the conserved residues or motifs in kinase catalytic domain regions across all viral kinases. Conserved sequence regions that are specific to a particular viral kinase cluster and the kinases that show close similarity to eukaryotic kinases were identified by using sequence and three-dimensional structural regions of eukaryotic kinases as reference. The regions specific to each viral kinase cluster can be used as signatures in the future in classifying uncharacterized viral kinases. We note that kinases from giant viruses Marseilleviridae have close similarity to viral oncogenes in the functional regions and in putative substrate binding regions indicating their possible role in cancer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

By contrast, serine phosphorylation (pS) of STAT3 can augment its nuclear transcriptional activity and promote essential mitochondrial functions, yet the role of pS-STAT3 among epithelial cancers is ill-defined. Here, we reveal that genetic ablation of pS-STAT3 in the   spontaneous gastric cancer mouse model and human gastric cancer cell line xenografts abrogated tumor growth that coincided with reduced proliferative potential of the tumor epithelium. Microarray gene expression profiling demonstrated that the suppressed gastric tumorigenesis in pS-STAT3-deficient   mice associated with reduced transcriptional activity of STAT3-regulated gene  implicated in cell proliferation and migration, inflammation, and angiogenesis, but not mitochondrial function or . Notably, the protumorigenic activity of pS-STAT3 aligned with its capacity to primarily augment RNA polymerase II-mediated transcriptional elongation, but not initiation, of STAT3 target genes. Furthermore, by using a combinatorial  and  proteomics approach based on the rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous protein (RIME) assay, we identified RuvB-like AAA ATPase 1 (RUVBL1/Pontin) and enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH) as interacting partners of pS-STAT3 that are pivotal for its transcriptional activity on STAT3 target genes. Collectively, these findings uncover a hitherto unknown transcriptional role and obligate requirement for pS-STAT3 in gastric cancer that could be extrapolated to other STAT3-driven cancers.

Herein, we address the molecular mechanisms affecting endothelium remodeling in disease. Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in patients with ischemic cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disorder, and renal failure, being a common feature in aging, diabetes, dyslipidemia, abnormal valve biomechanics, end-stage renal disease and atherosclerosis, a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Oxidative stress promotes calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) by increasing osteogenic transcription factors expression and activity in atherosclerotic plaques. Various markers of osteogenic differentiation are expressed by SMC in calcified atherosclerotic lesions. Interestingly, decreased levels of some bone factors and microRNAs accelerate vascular calcification and injured tissue regeneration. Another key player in endothelial remodeling is amino acids . Branched-chain amino acids are catabolized in several nonhepatic tissues including cardiac muscle. Immune activation and inflammation in cardiovascular disease patients associate with higher phenylalanine/ ratios. Understanding the whole process that underlies endothelium dysfunction is of paramount importance for the development of new therapeutic approaches.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603834>[Early diagnosis of phenylketonuria.

Light exposure was responsible for 58% loss of free thiols (Cys residues). No significant loss of other amino acid residues was observed and none of the most common oxidation products of tryptophan, , and phenylalanine were detected. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements of tryptophan showed 27% loss in samples exposed to light, which was ascribed to loss of protein solubility via protein polymerization rather than tryptophan oxidation. Protein carbonyls were mainly detected in forced oxidized samples at Day 0.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that Wingless type 5a (Wnt5a) is implicated in cardiovascular diseases through non-canonical Wnt cascades. However, its precise role during the pathogenesis of AS is still unclear. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the role and the underlying mechanism of Wnt5a/receptor  kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2)  in the promotion of AS process through affecting lipid accumulation and inflammation. In atherosclerotic clinical samples, Wnt5a levels were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. In vivo experiments were conducted by using apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE) mice model. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were applied for in vitro studies. Wnt5a was highly expressed in both of atherosclerotic clinical samples and apoE mice. The knockdown of Wnt5a significantly inhibited cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Additionally, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation aggravated the cholesterol accumulation and decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression in VSMCs. Depletion of intracellular cholesterol by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) led to the upregulation of ABCA1 and the inhibition of inflammation. Conversely, the overexpression of Wnt5a inhibited ABCA1 expression, facilitated cholesterol accumulation, impared cholesterol efflux, promoted NF-κB nuclear translocation and the inflammatory cytokines secretion. Moreover, the knockdown of Ror2 increased ABCA1 expression and reduced Wnt5a-induced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the knockdown of ABCA1 enhanced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Therefore, Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway was critical in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory response, which might be a promising therapeutic target for AS therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Phenylketonuria is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites in body fluids and brain tissues, subsequently leading to severe brain dysfunction. Various pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms underlying brain dysfunction in PKU have been described. However, the  changes and their impacts on the function of cerebral cortices of patients with PKU remain largely unknown.We measured the levels of small molecule metabolites in the cerebrocortical tissues of PKU mice and wild-type control mice using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolome analysis. Differential metabolites were further subjected to  pathway and enrichment analysis.Metabolome analysis revealed 35 compounds among 143 detected metabolites were significantly changed in PKU mice as compared to those in their wild-type littermates.  pathway and enrichment analysis of these differential metabolites showed that multiple  , including phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis; valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate ; purine ; arginine and proline  and methionine , were impacted in the cerebral cortices of PKU mice.The data revealed that multiple   in cerebral cortices of PKU mice were disturbed, suggesting that the disturbances of the   might contribute to neurological or neurodevelopmental dysfunction in PKU, which could thus provide new insights into brain pathogenic mechanisms in PKU as well as mechanistic insights for better understanding the complexity of the  mechanisms of the brain dysfunction in PKU.© 2019 The Authors.

This functional diversity has made understanding how inositol polyphosphates regulate cellular processes challenging to dissect. However, some inositol phosphates have been unexpectedly found in X-ray crystal structures, occasionally revealing structural and mechanistic details of effector protein regulation before functional consequences have been described. This review highlights a sampling of crystal structures describing the interaction between inositol phosphates and protein effectors. This list includes the RNA editing enzyme "adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA 2" (ADAR2), the Pds5B regulator of cohesin dynamics, the class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs) HDAC1 and HDAC3, and the PH domain of Bruton's  kinase (Btk). One of the most important enzymes responsible for higher-order inositol phosphate synthesis is inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), which plays dual roles in both inositol and phosphoinositide signaling. Structures of phosphoinositide lipid binding proteins have also revealed new aspects of protein effector regulation, as mediated by the nuclear receptors Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF-1, NR5A2) and Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2). Together, these studies underscore the structural diversity in binding interactions between effector proteins and inositol phosphate small signaling molecules, and further support that detailed structural studies can lead to new biological discovery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, recent studies have revealed its unique biological functionalities beneficial to human health. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of acute oral intake of sericin on amino acid and neurotransmitter  in the mouse brain. Acute administration of chemically modified sericin (0.26 g/30 g body weight) increased L-serine and  levels in the serum and brain, although the  content in the sericin was less than 3% (w/w). In addition, sericin administration led to a significant facilitation of noradrenergic turnover via enhancement of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol, a principal metabolite of noradrenaline, in several of the brain regions examined. These present findings suggest that oral intake of sericin efficiently delivers L-serine and  to the brain, thus stimulating noradrenergic activity in the brain. : DA: dopamine; 5-HIAA: 5-hydroxyindoleicetic acid; 5-HT: 5-hydroxytryptamine; HVA: homovanillic acid; MHPG: 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol; 3-MT: 3-methoxytyramine; NA: noradrenaline; NM: normetanephrine; Veh: vehicle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31453106>Exploratory study of the effect of one week of orally administered CNSA-001 (sepiapterin) on CNS levels of tetrahydrobiopterin, dihydrobiopterin and monoamine neurotransmitter metabolites in healthy volunteers.</a></h2><p>Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH) is a cofactor for the enzymes  hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzymes in the production of the neurotransmitters, dopamine and serotonin, respectively, in the central nervous system (CNS). Administration of BH is used clinically within the management of persons with genetic BH deficiencies, but the BH molecule does not cross the blood-brain barrier sufficiently. CNSA-001 is a pharmaceutical preparation of sepiapterin, a natural precursor of BH that induced larger increases in plasma BH compared with administration of the same doses of BH itself in healthy volunteers in a randomized trial. Here, we report the effects of 7 days of once-daily treatment with CNSA-001 60 mg/kg ( = 6) or placebo ( = 2) on metabolites of the BH synthetic pathway and on biomarkers of the serotonin (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid [5-HIAA]) and dopamine (homovanillic acid [HVA])  in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in subjects from this trial.

However, dietary adherence is challenging to maintain while ensuring adequate nutrition, which can lead to sub-optimal clinical outcomes. Metabolomics offers a systematic approach to identify new biomarkers of disease progression in PKU when using urine as a surrogate for blood specimens that is more accurate than self-reported diet records. Herein, the plasma and urine metabolome of a cohort of classic PKU patients (median age = 11 years; n = 22) mainly prescribed (78%) a Phe-restricted diet were characterized using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS). Overall, there was good mutual agreement between plasma Phe and  (Tyr) concentrations measured from PKU patients when using an amino acid analyzer based on UPLC-UV as compared to MSI-CE-MS with a mean bias of 12% (n = 82). Longitudinal measurements of recently diagnosed PKU infants (n = 3) revealed good long-term regulation of blood Phe with dietary management, and only occasional episodes exceeding the recommended therapeutic range (>360 μM) unlike older PKU patients. Plasma metabolomic studies demonstrated that non-adherent PKU patients had lower circulating concentrations of Tyr, arginine, 2-aminobutyric acid, and propionylcarnitine (q < 0.05, FDR) that were inversely correlated to Phe (r ≈ -0.600 to -0.830). Nontargeted metabolite profiling also revealed urinary biomarkers associated with poor dietary adherence among PKU patients, including elevated concentrations of catabolites indicative of Phe intoxication (e.g., phenylpyruvic acid, phenylacetylglutamine, hydroxyphenylacetic acid). Additionally, PKU patients with poor blood Phe control had lower excretion of urinary compounds derived from co- of Tyr due to microbiota activity (e.g., cresol sulfate, phenylsulfate), as well as several metabolites associated with inadequate nutrient intake, including low carnitine and B vitamin status (e.g., folic acid, vitamin B12). Interestingly, an unknown urinary metabolite was strongly correlated with Phe excretion in PKU patients (r = 0.861), which was subsequently identified as imidazole lactic acid when using high resolution MS/MS. Overall, urine profiling offers a non-invasive approach for better treatment monitoring of individual PKU patients, which can also guide the design of novel therapies that improve adherence to Phe-restricted diets without acquired nutritional deficiencies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31347670>Growth Arrest Specific Protein (Gas)-6/AXL Signaling Induces Preeclampsia (PE) in Rats.</a></h2><p>Preeclampsia (PE) is a complicated obstetric complication characterized by increased blood pressure, decreased trophoblast invasion, and inflammation. The growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) protein is known to induce dynamic cellular responses and is elevated in PE. Gas6 binds to the AXL  kinase receptor and AXL-mediated signaling is implicated in proliferation and migration observed in several tissues. Our laboratory utilized Gas6 to induce preeclamptic-like conditions in pregnant rats. Our objective was to determine the role of Gas6/AXL signaling as a possible model of PE. Briefly, pregnant rats were divided into 3 groups that received daily intraperitoneal injections (from gestational day 7.5-17.5) of PBS, Gas6, or Gas6 + R428 (an AXL inhibitor administered from gestational day 13.5-17.5). Animals dispensed Gas6 experienced elevated blood pressure, increased proteinuria, augmented caspase-3 mediated placental apoptosis and diminished trophoblast invasion. Gas6 also enhanced expression of several PE related genes and a number of inflammatory mediators. Gas6 further enhanced placental oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial respiration. Each of these PE related characteristics were ameliorated in dams and/or their placentae when AXL inhibition by R428 occurred in tandem with Gas6 treatment. We conclude that Gas6 signaling is capable of inducing PE and that inhibition of AXL prevents disease progression in pregnant rats. These results provide insight into  associated with PE that could be useful in the clarification of potential therapeutic approaches.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, in the latter case, the mechanisms involved downstream of AT2R remain to be defined. We recently described a novel Caveolin-1(CAV1)/Ras-related protein 5A (Rab5)/Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) signaling axis that promotes metastasis in melanoma, colon, and breast cancer cells. Here, we evaluated whether the antimetastatic effect of AT2R is connected to inhibition of this pathway. We found that murine melanoma B16F10 cells expressed AT2R, while MDAMB-231 human breast cancer cells did not. AT2R activation blocked migration, transendothelial migration, and metastasis of B16F10(cav-1) cells, and this effect was lost when AT2R was silenced. Additionally, AT2R activation reduced transendothelial migration of A375 human melanoma cells expressing CAV1. The relevance of AT2R was further underscored by showing that overexpression of the AT2R in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased migration. Moreover, AT2R activation increased non-receptor protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) activity, decreased phosphorylation of CAV1 on -14 as well as Rab5/Rac1 activity, and reduced lung metastasis of B16F10(cav-1) cells in C57BL/6 mice. Thus, AT2R activation reduces migration, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells by PTP1B-mediated CAV1 dephosphorylation and inhibition of the CAV1/Rab5/Rac-1 pathway. In doing so, these observations open up interesting, novel therapeutic opportunities to treat metastatic cancer disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648944>Of mice and men: Plasma phenylalanine reduction in PKU corrects neurotransmitter  in the brain.</a></h2><p>In phenylketonuria (PKU), mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene decrease the ability of PAH to convert phenylalanine (Phe) to  (Tyr), resulting in Phe accumulation in the blood and brain and disruption of neurotransmitter (NT) biosynthesis and .

Among RNS,  nitration, the addition of an NO group to a  residue, can modulate reduced nicotinamide-dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-generating systems and, therefore, can alter the levels of NADPH, a key cofactor in cellular redox homeostasis. NADPH also acts as an indispensable electron donor within a wide range of enzymatic reactions, biosynthetic , and detoxification processes, which could affect plant viability. To extend our knowledge about the regulation of this key cofactor by this nitric oxide (NO)-related post-translational modification, we analyzed the effect of  nitration on another NADPH-generating enzyme, the NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), under LT stress. In  seedlings exposed to short-term LT (4 °C for 48 h), a 50% growth reduction accompanied by an increase in the content of superoxide, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite, in addition to diminished cytosolic NADP-ME activity, were found. In vitro assays confirmed that peroxynitrite inhibits cytosolic NADP-ME2 activity due to  nitration. The mass spectrometric analysis of nitrated NADP-ME2 enabled us to determine that Tyr-73 was exclusively nitrated to 3-nitrotyrosine by peroxynitrite. The in silico analysis of the  NADP-ME2 protein sequence suggests that Tyr73 nitration could disrupt the interactions between the specific amino acids responsible for protein structure stability. In conclusion, the present data show that short-term LT stress affects the  of ROS and RNS, which appears to negatively modulate the activity of cytosolic NADP-ME through the  nitration process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570442>Antitumor Activity of Rivoceranib Against Canine Mammary Gland Tumor Cell Lines.</a></h2><p>Canine mammary gland tumors (CMGTs) are the most common tumors in female dogs. Rivoceranib (also known as apatinib) is a novel anti-angiogenic  kinase inhibitor that selectively binds to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2). The aim of this study was to disclose the antitumor effects of rivoceranib on CMGT cell lines.The direct effects of rivoceranib on CMGT cells in vitro were analyzed by cell proliferation and migration assays. Cell-cycle distribution and apoptotic ratio were analyzed by flow cytometry. Expression levels of phosphorylated VEGFR2 were evaluated by western blot analysis.Rivoceranib treatment significantly reduced the proliferation and migration of CMGT cells in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry results revealed significant increases in G/G phase arrest and apoptosis proportional to the drug concentration used. Rivoceranib reduced the level of phosphorylated VEGFR2.We confirm that rivoceranib exerts antitumor effects on CMGT cells by inhibiting biological functions.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Certain autoantibodies, such as anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, antiribosomal P and antiphospholipid antibodies may cause injury in subsets of patients with diffuse neuropsychiatric disease. Activation of microglia via autoantibodies, interferon-a or other immune reactants, may amplify the inflammatory response and promote neuronal damage. New inflammatory , such as TWEAK/Fn14, Bruton's  kinase, Nogo-a and ACE may represent additional potential targets of therapy. Novel neuroimaging techniques suggest alterations in brain perfusion and , increased concentration of neurometabolites, indicative of glial activation, vasculopathy and neuronal impairment.NPSLE encompasses a diverse phenotype with distinct pathogenic mechanisms, which could be targeted by novel therapies or repositioning of existing drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31343992>Gene loci associated with insulin secretion in islets from non-diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>Genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes is primarily due to β-cell dysfunction. However, a genetic study to directly interrogate β-cell function ex vivo has never been previously performed. We isolated 233,447 islets from 483 Diversity Outbred (DO) mice maintained on a Western-style diet, and measured insulin secretion in response to a variety of secretagogues. Insulin secretion from DO islets ranged >1,000-fold even though none of the mice were diabetic. The insulin secretory response to each secretagogue had a unique genetic architecture; some of the loci were specific for one condition, whereas others overlapped. Human loci that are syntenic to many of the insulin secretion QTL from mouse are associated with diabetes-related SNPs in human genome-wide association studies. We report on three genes, Ptpn18, Hunk and Zfp148, where the phenotype predictions from the genetic screen were fulfilled in our studies of transgenic mouse models. These three genes encode a non-receptor type protein  phosphatase, a serine/threonine protein kinase, and a Krϋppel-type zinc-finger transcription factor, respectively. Our results demonstrate that genetic variation in insulin secretion that can lead to type 2 diabetes is discoverable in non-diabetic individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417183>BMP10 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma progression via PTPRS-STAT3 axis.</a></h2><p>Bone morphogenetic protein 10 (BMP10), one member of the BMP family, is involved in various development events. Dysregulation of BMP10 has been observed in several diseases, including hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy, Hirschsprung disease and blood vessel formation. However, its role in liver cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we reported that BMP10 was significantly downregulated in HCC at both mRNA and protein level. Decreased BMP10 was associated with bigger tumor size, worse TNM stage, earlier recurrence and poorer survival. BMP10 negatively regulated HCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanism study revealed that BMP10 suppressed tumor cell growth by inhibiting STAT3 signaling. Interestingly, we found that cytoplasmic BMP10 interacted with both receptor protein  phosphatase sigma (PTPRS) and STAT3, which facilitated dephosphorylation of STAT3 by PTPRS. Altogether, our study has revealed the clinical significance of BMP10 in HCC, and suppression of HCC cell growth by BMP10 via PTPRS-STAT3 axis, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting STAT3 signaling in HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576186>Benefit effect of REM-sleep deprivation on memory impairment induced by intensive exercise in male wistar rats: with respect to hippocampal BDNF and TrkB.</a></h2><p>Many factors affect our learning and memory quality, but according to different studies, having a positive or negative impact pertains to their characteristics like intensity or the amount.The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of 24-hour REM-sleep deprivation on continuous-high intensity forced exercise-induced memory impairment and its effect on Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and  kinase B (TrkB) levels in the hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex area (PFC).Animals were conditioned to run on treadmills for 5 weeks then, were deprived of sleep for 24 h using the modified multiple platforms. The effect of intensive exercise and/or 24-h REM-SD was studied on behavioral performance using Morris Water Maze protocol for 2 days, and BDNF/TrkB levels were assessed in hippocampus and PFC after behavioral probe test using western blotting.After 5 weeks of intensive exercise and 24-h REM-SD, spatial memory impairment and reduction of BDNF and TrkB levels were found in hippocampus and PFC. 24-h REM-SD improved memory impairment and intensive exercise-induced downregulation of BDNF and TrkB protein levels.The results of the study suggested that sleep deprivation might act as a compensatory factor to reduce memory impairment when the animal is under severe stressful condition.© 2019 Mahboubi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31322015>Design and synthesis of phthalazine-based compounds as potent anticancer agents with potential antiangiogenic activity via VEGFR-2 inhibition.</a></h2><p>In the designed compounds, either a biarylamide or biarylurea moiety or an N-substituted piperazine motif was linked to position 1 of the phthalazine core.

A growing arsenal of therapeutic agents is being designed to suppress the transfer of mitochondria from stromal to malignant cells, to interfere with mitochondrial biogenesis, to directly inhibit respiratory chain complexes, or to disrupt mitochondrial function in other ways. For the experimental treatment of cancers, OXPHOS inhibitors can be advantageously combined with  kinase inhibitors, as well as with other strategies to inhibit glycolysis, thereby causing a lethal energy crisis. Unfortunately, most of the preclinical data arguing in favor of OXPHOS inhibition have been obtained in xenograft models, in which human cancer cells are implanted in immunodeficient mice. Future studies on OXPHOS inhibitors should elaborate optimal treatment schedules and combination regimens that stimulate-or at least are compatible with-anticancer immune responses for long-term tumor control.© 2019 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606631>Delaying the biosynthesis of aromatic secondary metabolites in postharvest strawberry fruit exposed to elevated CO atmosphere.</a></h2><p>Aromatic secondary metabolites are closely related to quality attributes of postharvest fruit. In the present study, 20% CO was applied to strawberry fruit to investigate the regulation of elevated CO on aromatic secondary metabolites. The results showed that elevated CO delayed accumulations of anthocyanins, eugenol and lignin. Phenylalanine and , the precursors of the above secondary metabolites, were 18.90% and 35.61%, respectively, lower in CO-treated fruit compared with the control on day 6. Furthermore, enzyme activities and transcriptional profiles analysis showed pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis were activated by elevated CO whereas the aromatic amino acids (AAAs) pathway was inhibited. These results indicated that elevated CO restricted carbon flux into aromatic secondary  by inhibiting the AAAs pathway, leading to the decrease of phenylalanine and , and thus, delayed the accumulation of aromatic secondary metabolites. In addition, the effect of elevated CO was eliminated after transferred CO-treated fruit to air.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Owing to the aging effect and the ensuing deterioration of body function, the elder patients may have atypical responses to sepsis. Diagnosis and pathogenesis of sepsis in this population are thus difficult, which hindered effective treatment and management in clinic. To investigated age effects on sepsis, 158 elderly septic patients and 71 non-septic elderly participants were enrolled, and their plasma samples were collected for transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and metabolomics (NMR and GC-MS) analyses, which are both increasingly being utilized to discover key molecular changes and potential biomarkers for various diseases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was subsequently performed to assist cross-platform integration. Real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for validation of RNA-seq results. For further understanding of the mechanisms, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) experiment was performed both in young and middle-aged rats, which were subjected to NMR-based metabolomics study and validated for several key inflammation  by western blot. Comprehensive analysis of data from the two omics approaches provides a systematic perspective on dysregulated  that could facilitate the development of therapy and biomarkers for elderly sepsis. Additionally, the metabolites of lactate, arginine, histamine, , glutamate and glucose were shown to be highly specific and sensitive in distinguishing septic patients from healthy controls. Significant increases of arginine, trimethylamine N-oxide and allantoin characterized elderly patient incurred sepsis. Further analytical and biological validations in different subpopulations of septic patients should be carried out, allowing accurate diagnostics and precise treatment of sepsis in clinic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521785>Skin metabolome reveals immune responses in yellow drum Nibea albiflora to Cryptocaryon irritans infection.</a></h2><p>The yellow drum Nibea albiflora is less susceptible to Cryptocaryon irritans infection than is the case with other marine fishes such as Larimichthys crocea, Lateolabrax japonicus, and Pagrus major. To investigate further their resistance mechanism, we infected the N. albiflora with the C. irritans at a median lethal concentration of 2050 theronts/g fish. The skins of the infected and the uninfected fishes were sampled at 24 h and 72 h followed by an extensive analysis of . The study results revealed that there were 2694 potential metabolites. At 24 h post-infection, 12 metabolites were up-regulated and 17 were down-regulated whereas at 72 h post-infection, 22 metabolites were up-regulated and 26 were down-regulated. Pathway enrichment analysis shows that the differential enriched  were higher at 24 h with 22 categories and 58 subcategories (49 up, 9 down) than at 72 h whereby the differential enriched  were 6 categories and 8 subcategories (4 up, 4 down). In addition, the principal component analysis (PCA) plot shows that at 24 h the metabolites composition of infected group were separately clustered to uninfected group while at 72 h the metabolites composition in infected group were much closer to uninfected group. This indicated that C. irritans caused strong  stress on the N. albiflora at 24 h and restoration of the dysregulated  state took place at 72 h of infection. Also, at 72 h post infection a total of 17 compounds were identified as potential biomarkers. Furthermore, out of 2694 primary metabolites detected, 23 metabolites could be clearly identified and semi quantified with a known identification number and assigned into 66 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) . Most of the enriched KEGG  were mainly from  pathway classes, including the  pathway, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, taurine and hypotaurine , purine , linoleic acid , phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis. Others were glyoxylate and dicarboxylate , glutathione , and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate . Moreover, out of the identified metabolites, only 6 metabolites were statistically differentially expressed, namely, L -glutamate (up-regulated) at 24 h was important for energy and precursor for other glutathiones and instruments of preventing oxidative injury; 15-hydroxy- eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), (S)-(-)-2-Hydroxyisocaproic acid, and adenine (up-regulated) at 72 h were important for anti-inflammatory and immune responses during infection; others were delta-valerolactam and betaine which were down-regulated compared to uninfected group at 72 h, might be related to immure responses including stimulation of immune system such as production of antibodies. Our results therefore further advance our understanding on the immunological regulation of N. albiflora during immune response against infections as they indicated a strong relationship between skin metabolome and C. irritans infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although CSF-1 and IL-34 share the same receptor through which they trigger similar effects, IL-34 also binds to receptors protein- phosphatase (PTP)-ζ and syndecan-1. Thus, IL-34 is involved in several signaling  and participates in a wide array of biological actions. This review analyzes current studies on the role of IL-34 under physiological and pathological conditions, and explores its potential significance as a disease biomarker and therapeutic target. In physiological conditions, IL-34 expression is restricted to the microglia and Langerhans cells, with a fundamental role in cellular differentiation, adhesion and migration, proliferation, , and survival. It is released in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns or pro-inflammatory cytokines, with effects over various immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and regulatory T cells that shape the immune microenvironment. Over the past decade, accumulating evidence has suggested a potent immune regulation of IL-34 in pathological states such as autoimmune diseases, cancer, transplant rejection, neurologic diseases, infections, and inflammatory diseases. Importantly, IL-34 may hold great promise for acting as a biomarker for monitoring disease severity and progression, and may serve as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of several diseases in clinical settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570469>Conversion Hepatectomy for Huge Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Arterioportal Shunt After Chemoembolization and Lenvatinib Therapy.</a></h2><p>Large tumor size and arterioportal shunt are poor prognostic factors for hepatocellular carcinoma. Lenvatinib is a novel and potent multi- kinase inhibitor developed in Japan. A 66-year-old woman with hepatocellular carcinoma and untreated hepatitis C was referred to our hospital. She was judged as unresectable and was treated with four sessions of transarterial chemoembolization; however, the therapeutic effect was unsatisfactory because of major arterioportal shunt. Lenvatinib was sequentially administered for 4 months. Thereafter, we observed tumor shrinkage, complete disappearance of arterioportal shunt, and obvious improvement in liver function. A curative conversion hepatectomy was successfully accomplished. The extremely high levels of tumor markers almost normalized; the pretreatment levels were 1,008,021 ng/ml for alpha-fetoprotein. At 1 year after the primary treatment, the patient has not experienced recurrence. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a patient with initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with arterioportal shunt who underwent conversion hepatectomy after multidisciplinary treatment, including lenvatinib.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Although the mechanisms that trigger the loss of dopaminergic neurons are unclear, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation are thought to have key roles. An early-onset form of Parkinson's disease is associated with mutations in the PINK1 kinase and PRKN ubiquitin ligase genes. PINK1 and Parkin (encoded by PRKN) are involved in the clearance of damaged mitochondria in cultured cells, but recent evidence obtained using knockout and knockin mouse models have led to contradictory results regarding the contributions of PINK1 and Parkin to mitophagy in vivo. It has previously been shown that PINK1 and Parkin have a key role in adaptive immunity by repressing presentation of mitochondrial antigens, which suggests that autoimmune mechanisms participate in the aetiology of Parkinson's disease. Here we show that intestinal infection with Gram-negative bacteria in Pink1 mice engages mitochondrial antigen presentation and autoimmune mechanisms that elicit the establishment of cytotoxic mitochondria-specific CD8 T cells in the periphery and in the brain. Notably, these mice show a sharp decrease in the density of dopaminergic axonal varicosities in the striatum and are affected by motor impairment that is reversed after treatment with L-DOPA. These data support the idea that PINK1 is a repressor of the immune system, and provide a pathophysiological model in which intestinal infection acts as a triggering event in Parkinson's disease, which highlights the relevance of the gut-brain axis in the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31317326>Synchronicity of genetic variants between primary sites and metastatic lymph nodes, and prognostic impact in nodal metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>Nodal positive lung adenocarcinoma includes wide range of survival. Several methods for the classification of nodal-positive lung cancer have been proposed. However, classification considering the impact of targetable genetic variants are lacking. The possibility of genetic variants for the better stratification of nodal positive lung adenocarcinoma was estimated.Mutations of 36 genes between primary sites and metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) were compared using next-generation sequencing. Subsequently, mutations in EGFR and BRAF, rearrangements in ALK and ROS1 were evaluated in 69 resected pN1-2M0 adenocarcinoma cases. Recurrence-free survival (RFS), post-recurrence survival (PRS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated with respect to targetable variants and  kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy after recurrence.About 90% of variants were shared and allele frequencies were similar between primary and metastatic sites. In 69 pN1-2M0 cases, EGFR/ALK were positive in primary sites of 39 cases and same EGFR/ALK variants were confirmed in metastatic LNs of 96.7% tissue-available cases. Multivariate analyses indicated positive EGFR/ALK status was associated with worse RFS (HR 2.366; 95% CI 1.244-4.500; P = 0.009), and PRS was prolonged in cases receiving TKI therapy (no post-recurrence TKI therapies, HR 3.740; 95% CI 1.449-9.650; P = 0.006). OS did not differ with respect to targetable variants or TKI therapy.Cases harbouring targetable genetic variants had a higher risk of recurrence, but PRS was prolonged by TKI therapy. Classification according to the targetable genetic status provides a basis for predicting recurrence and determining treatment strategies after recurrence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31367831>The Role of the Brain in the Regulation of Peripheral Noradrenaline-producing Organs in Rats During Morphogenesis.</a></h2><p>This work represents one part of our research project, in which we attempted to prove that a humoral regulation between noradrenaline-producing organs exist in the perinatal period. In this study, we used a rat model that allowed blocking the synthesis of noradrenalin in the brain and evaluated gene expression and protein levels of noradrenaline key synthesis enzymes such as  hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) in peripheral noradrenaline-producing organs. As a result, we showed an increased gene expression of TH and DBH in adrenal glands. These data indicate that, if neonatal rat brain lacks the ability to produce noradrenaline, then the synthesis of noradrenaline in adrenal glands increased as a compensatory process, so that the concentration levels in blood are maintained at normal levels. This indicates that there is a humoral regulation between brain and adrenal glands, which is not fully understood yet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491419>Postnatal genistein administration selectively abolishes sexual dimorphism in specific hypothalamic dopaminergic system in mice.</a></h2><p>As demonstrated in previous studies, early postnatal genistein (GEN) administration to mice pups of both sexes, at doses similar to that of infant soy-based formulas, may affect the development of some steroid-sensitive neuronal circuits (i.e. nitrergic and vasopressinergic systems), causing irreversible alterations in adults. Here, we investigated the hypothalamic and mesencephalic dopaminergic system (identified with  hydroxylase immunohistochemistry). GEN administration (50 mg/kg) to mice of both sexes during the first week of postnatal life specifically affected  hydroxylase immunohistochemistry in the hypothalamic subpopulation of neurons, abolishing their sexual dimorphism. On the contrary, we did not observe any effects in the mesencephalic groups. Due to the large involvement of dopamine in circuits controlling rodent sexual behavior and food intake, these results clearly indicate that the early postnatal administration of GEN may irreversibly alter the control of reproduction, of energetic , and other behaviors. These results suggest the need for a careful evaluation of the use of soy products in both human and animal newborns.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, skeletal side effects are commonly observed in pediatric patients receiving long-term treatment with IMA. Additionally,  studies have shown that IMA and NIL alter vitamin D , which may further impair bone . To determine whether TKIs directly affect bone cell function, the present study treated the human osteoblastic cell line SaOS-2 with IMA or NIL and assessed effects on their mineralization capacity as well as mRNA expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), two cytokines that regulate osteoclastogenesis. Both TKIs significantly inhibited mineralization and downregulated osteoblast marker genes, including alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osterix, as well as genes associated with the pro-osteogenic Wnt signaling pathway; NIL was more potent than IMA. In addition, both TKIs increased the RANKL/OPG ratio, which is known to stimulate osteoclastogenesis. The present results suggested that the TKIs IMA and NIL directly inhibited osteoblast differentiation and directly promoted a pro-osteoclastogenic environment through the RANKL-OPG signaling axis. Thus, we propose that future work is required to determine whether the bone health of CML patients undergoing TKI-treatment should be routinely monitored.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474318>Redefining the Etiologic Landscape of Cerebellar Malformations.</a></h2><p>Cerebellar malformations are diverse congenital anomalies frequently associated with developmental disability. Although genetic and prenatal non-genetic causes have been described, no systematic analysis has been performed. Here, we present a large-exome sequencing study of Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM) and cerebellar hypoplasia (CBLH). We performed exome sequencing in 282 individuals from 100 families with DWM or CBLH, and we established a molecular diagnosis in 36 of 100 families, with a significantly higher yield for CBLH (51%) than for DWM (16%). The 41 variants impact 27 neurodevelopmental-disorder-associated genes, thus demonstrating that CBLH and DWM are often features of monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders. Though only seven monogenic causes (19%) were identified in more than one individual, neuroimaging review of 131 additional individuals confirmed cerebellar abnormalities in 23 of 27 genetic disorders (85%). Prenatal risk factors were frequently found among individuals without a genetic diagnosis (30 of 64 individuals [47%]). Single-cell RNA sequencing of prenatal human cerebellar tissue revealed gene enrichment in neuronal and vascular cell types; this suggests that defective vasculogenesis may disrupt cerebellar development. Further, de novo gain-of-function variants in PDGFRB, a  kinase receptor essential for vascular progenitor signaling, were associated with CBLH, and this discovery links genetic and non-genetic etiologies. Our results suggest that genetic defects impact specific cerebellar cell types and implicate abnormal vascular development as a mechanism for cerebellar malformations. We also confirmed a major contribution for non-genetic prenatal factors in individuals with cerebellar abnormalities, substantially influencing diagnostic evaluation and counseling regarding recurrence risk and prognosis.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

However, the mechanism of PACs induced toxicity still remains elusive. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of a typical mixture of PACs found in oil sand extract (OSE) on the respiratory, hepatic and nervous systems in humans using in vitro cell culture models followed by non-targeted metabolomics analysis. OSE collected from Alberta, Canada was fractionated into PAC and alkane fractions, and their effects after 24 h exposure on the cell viability measured by MTT assay in three human cell lines (A549, HepG2, and SK-N-SH) were studied. The PAC fractions showed significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity. A549 cells showed the highest sensitivity to OSE extracts, followed by SK-N-SH and HepG2. In contrast, the alkane fractions showed no effects on cell viability. The three human cell lines were further exposed with the PACs at 10% and 20% lethal concentration for 24 h. Metabolomics analysis of the cell extracts indicated that PACs treatments showed different disruptions on possible   on the three cell lines. PACs altered the sex steroid hormone  and regulated the levels of leukotrienes metabolites in all three cell types. The amino acids L-cysteine, L-glutamine,  that are known to cause respiratory effects were significantly up-regulated in A549 cells. The PACs treated HepG2 cells showed down-regulation in metabolites responsible for the inflammatory mediation. Treatment of the differentiated SK-N-SH cells showed up-regulated metabolites involved with butanoate, fatty acid, and pyrimidine . Leukotriene metabolites were found to be significantly increased in all PACs treated cells. In conclusion, our results showed that PACs in OSE can alter the  of the human lung, liver and neuronal cells and may induce toxicity in multiple target organs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In mammalians, as arginine analogue, it is an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of CAN-induced nitric oxide level limitation on the antioxidant system and -nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)  in roots of tomato seedlings. Treatment with CAN (10 or 50 µM) for 24-72 h led to restriction in root growth. Arginine-dependent NOS-like activity was almost completely inhibited, demonstrating direct effect of CAN action. CAN increased total antioxidant capacity and the level of sulphydryl groups. Catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased in CAN exposed roots. CAN supplementation resulted in the decrease of transcript levels of genes coding CAT (with the exception of ). Genes coding SOD (except  and ) were upregulated by CAN short treatment; prolonged exposition to 50-µM CAN resulted in downregulation of , and . Activity of glutathione reductase dropped down after short-term (10-µM CAN) supplementation, while glutathione peroxidase activity was not affected. Transcript levels of glutathione reductase genes declined in response to CAN. Genes coding glutathione peroxidase were upregulated by 50-µM CAN, while 10-µM CAN downregulated . Inhibition of NOS-like activity by CAN resulted in lower GSNO accumulation in root tips. Activity of GSNO reductase was decreased by short-term supplementation with CAN. In contrast, GSNO reductase protein abundance was higher, while transcript levels were slightly altered in roots exposed to CAN. This is the first report on identification of differentially nitrated proteins in response to supplementation with nonproteinogenic amino acid. Among nitrated proteins differentially modified by CAN, seed storage proteins (after short-term CAN treatment) and components of the cellular redox system (after prolonged CAN supplementation) were identified. The findings demonstrate that due to inhibition of NOS-like activity, CAN leads to modification in antioxidant system. Limitation in GSNO level is due to lower nitric oxide formation, while GSNO catabolism is less affected. We demonstrated that monodehydroascorbate reductase, activity of which is inhibited in roots of CAN-treated plants, is the protein preferentially modified by  nitration.Copyright © 2019 Staszek, Krasuska, Otulak-Kozieł, Fettke and Gniazdowska.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31342590>Impaired ligand-dependent MET activation caused by an extracellular SEMA domain missense mutation in lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Aberrant activation of the MET/hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor participates in the malignant behavior of cancer cells, such as invasion-metastasis and resistance to molecular targeted drugs. Many mutations in the MET extracellular region have been reported, but their significance is largely unknown. Here, we report the dysregulation of mutant MET originally found in a lung cancer patient with Val370 to Asp370 (V370D) replacement located in the extracellular SEMA domain. MET-knockout cells were prepared and reconstituted with WT-MET or V370D-MET. HGF stimulation induced MET dimerization and biological responses in cells reconstituted with WT-MET, but HGF did not induce MET dimerization and failed to induce biological responses in V370D-MET cells. The V370D mutation abrogated HGF-dependent drug resistance of lung cancer cells to epidermal growth factor receptor- kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI). Compared with WT-MET cells, V370D-MET cells showed different activation patterns in receptor  kinases upon exposure to survival/growth-stressed conditions. Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that affinity between the extracellular region of V370D-MET and HGF was reduced compared with that for WT-MET. Further analysis of the association between V370D-MET and the separate domains of HGF indicated that the SP domain of HGF was unchanged, but its association with the NK4 domain of HGF was mostly lost in V370D-MET. These results indicate that the V370D mutation in the MET receptor impairs the functional association with HGF and is therefore a loss-of-function mutation. This mutation may change the dependence of cancer cell growth/survival on signaling molecules, which may promote cancer cell characteristics under certain conditions.© 2019 The Authors.

We report noninvasive monitoring of patient response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy given alone or in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (bevacizumab) in a randomized clinical trial. At four time points during neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± bevacizumab of receptor -protein kinase erbB-2-negative breast cancers, we measured metabolites and inflammation-related markers in patient's serum. We report significant changes in the levels of several molecules induced by bevacizumab, the most prominent being an increase in pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and von Willebrand factor (VWF). Serum levels of AXL, VWF and pulmonary and activation-regulated cytokine (PARC/CCL18) reflected response to chemotherapy alone or in combination with bevacizumab. We further analyzed serum cytokines in relation to tumor characteristics such as gene expression, tumor metabolites and tumor infiltrating leukocytes. We found that VWF and growth-differentiation factor 15 tumor mRNA levels correlated with their respective serum protein levels suggesting that these cytokines may be produced by tumors and outflow to the bloodstream while influencing the tumor microenvironment locally. Finally, we used binomial logistic regression which allowed to predict patient's response using only 10 noninvasive biomarkers. Our study highlights the potential of monitoring circulating levels of cytokines and metabolites during breast cancer therapy.© 2019 The Authors.

Its  profiles were not disclosed. The aim of this study was to study the  of ibrutinib in the hepatocytes of rat, dog and human.Ibrutinib was incubated with hepatocytes at 37  C for 2 h, after which the samples were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection and Q-Exactive Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer (UHPLC-DAD-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS). The acquired data were processed by MetWorks™ software.A total of 20 metabolites were structurally identified by their MS and MS data. And M1 and M5 were unambiguously identified by using authentic standards. The biotransformation of ibrutinib referred to hydroxylation, hydration, oxygenation, epoxide hydrolysis, dehydrogenation, dealkylation and GSH conjugation.Human had the relatively low capability in metabolizing ibrutinib. Compared with rat, dog had the closer  profiles to humans and it would be more suitable for toxicity study. This study would provide more valuable information with respect to the in vitro disposition of ibrutinib.This article is protected by copyright.

Despite its importance, it has been associated with hepatotoxicity observed in clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance. The mechanisms of hepatotoxicity at the chemical and cellular levels may link to drug . In this study, the N- and α-carbon oxidation processes of lapatinib catalyzed by CYP3A4 were explored by density functional theory method. The calculation results show that oxidation of C is the primary  process and carboxylic acid is the main  product. Both hydroxylation of C and subsequent formation of primary amines are feasible. However, it is not easy for the primary amines to form active metabolites nitroso, which indicates that there are other paths for the production of nitroso. Carboxylic acid is not the main metabolite of N oxidation because of higher hydrolysis energy barrier of intermediate nitrone. It is worthy to study subsequent N-hydroxylation and its downstream reaction, which may be the main pathway for the formation of nitroso. These results lay the foundation for drug design and optimization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526339>Recent Progress in the Development of Small Molecule c-Met Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>C-Met, also referred to as Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor (HGFR), is a heterodimeric receptor  kinase. It has been determined that c-Met gene mutations, overexpression, and amplification also occur in a variety of human tumor types, and these events are closely related to the aberrant activation of the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway. Meanwhile, high c-Met expression is closely associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. The c-Met kinase has emerged as an attractive target for developing antitumor agents. In this review, we cover the recent advances on the small molecule c-Met inhibitors discovered from 2018 until now, with a main focus on the rational design, synthesis and structureactivity relationship analysis.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296851>Zinc-binding to the cytoplasmic PAS domain regulates the essential WalK histidine kinase of Staphylococcus aureus.</a></h2><p>WalKR (YycFG) is the only essential two-component regulator in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. WalKR regulates peptidoglycan synthesis, but this function alone does not explain its essentiality. Here, to further understand WalKR function, we investigate a suppressor mutant that arose when WalKR activity was impaired; a histidine to  substitution (H271Y) in the cytoplasmic Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain of the histidine kinase WalK. Introducing the WalK mutation into wild-type S. aureus activates the WalKR regulon. Structural analyses of the WalK PAS domain reveal a metal-binding site, in which a zinc ion (Zn) is tetrahedrally-coordinated by four amino acids including H271. The WalK mutation abrogates metal binding, increasing WalK kinase activity and WalR phosphorylation. Thus, Zn-binding negatively regulates WalKR. Promoter-reporter experiments using S. aureus confirm Zn sensing by this system. Identification of a metal ligand recognized by the WalKR system broadens our understanding of this critical S. aureus regulon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296884>Quantification of the flux of  pathway metabolites during nitisinone treatment of Alkaptonuria.</a></h2><p>Nitisinone decreases homogentisic acid (HGA) in Alkaptonuria (AKU) by inhibiting the   pathway in humans. The effect of different daily doses of nitisinone on circulating and 24 h urinary excretion of phenylalanine (PA),  (TYR), hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPPA), hydroxyphenyllactate (HPLA) and HGA in patients with AKU was studied over a four week period. Forty AKU patients, randomised into five groups of eight patients, received doses of 1, 2, 4 or 8 mg of nitisinone daily, or no drug (control). Metabolites were analysed by tandem mass spectrometry in 24 h urine and serum samples collected before and after nitisinone. Serum metabolites were corrected for total body water and the sum of 24 hr urine plus total body water metabolites of PA, TYR, HPPA, HPLA and HGA were determined. Body weight and urine urea were used to check on stability of diet and  over the 4 weeks of study. The sum of quantities of urine metabolites (PA, TYR, HPPA, HPLA and HGA) were similar pre- and post-nitisinone. The sum of total body water metabolites were significantly higher post-nitisinone (p < 0.0001) at all doses. Similarly, combined 24 hr urine:total body water ratios for all analytes were significantly higher post-nitisinone, compared with pre-nitisinone baseline for all doses (p = 0.0002 - p < 0.0001). Significantly higher concentrations of metabolites from the   pathway were observed in a dose dependant manner following treatment with nitisinone and we speculate that, for the first time, experimental evidence of the metabolite pool that would otherwise be directed towards pigment formation, has been unmasked.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310388>Complementation of dopaminergic signaling by Pitx3-GDNF synergy induces dopamine secretion by multipotent Ntera2 cells.</a></h2><p>Human teratocarcinoma cell line Ntera2 (NT2) expresses dopamine signals and has shown its safe profile for clinical applications. Attempts to restore complete dopaminergic (DAergic) phenotype enabling these cells to secrete dopamine have not been fully successful so far. We applied a blend of gene transfer techniques and a defined medium to convert NT2 cells to fully DAergic. The cells were primarily engineered to overexpress the Pitx3 gene product and then cultured in a growth medium supplemented with knockout serum and retinoic acid to form embroid bodies (EBs). Trypsinization of EB colonies produced single cells ready for differentiation. Neuronal/DAergic induction was promoted by applying conditioned medium taken from engineered human astrocytomas over-secreting glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Immunocytochemistry, reverse-transcription and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses confirmed significantly induced expression of molecules involved in dopamine signaling and  including  hydroxylase, Nurr1, dopamine transporter, and aromatic acid decarboxylase. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated release of dopamine only from a class of fully differentiated cells expressing Pitx3 and exposed to GDNF. In addition, Pitx3 and GDNF additively promoted in vitro neuroprotection against Parkinsonian toxin. One month after transplantation to the striatum of 6-OHDA-leasioned rats, differentiated NT2 cells survived and induced significant increase in striatal volume. Besides, cell implantation improved motor coordination in Parkinson's disease (PD) rat models. Our findings highlight the importance of Pitx3-GDNF interplay in dopamine signaling and indicate that our strategy might be useful for the restoration of DAergic fate of NT2 cells to make them clinically applicable toward cell replacement therapy of PD.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31371986>Comparative review of drug-drug interactions with epidermal growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitors for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>The development of small-molecule  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has revolutionized the management of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Because these drugs are commonly used in combination with other types of medication, the risk of clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is an important consideration, especially for patients using multiple drugs for coexisting medical conditions. Clinicians need to be aware of the potential for clinically important DDIs when considering therapeutic options for individual patients. In this article, we describe the main mechanisms underlying DDIs with the EGFR-TKIs that are currently approved for the treatment of NSCLC, and, specifically, the potential for interactions mediated via effects on gastrointestinal pH, cytochrome P450-dependent , uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase, and transporter proteins. We review evidence of such DDIs with the currently approved EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, osimertinib, and icotinib) and discuss several information sources that are available online to aid clinical decision-making. We conclude by summarizing the most clinically relevant DDIs with these EFGR-TKIs and provide recommendations for managing, minimizing, or avoiding DDIs with the different agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405045>Analysis of Catecholamines and Pterins in Inborn Errors of Monoamine Neurotransmitter -From Past to Future.</a></h2><p>Inborn errors of monoamine neurotransmitter biosynthesis and degradation belong to the rare inborn errors of . They are caused by monogenic variants in the genes encoding the proteins involved in (1) neurotransmitter biosynthesis (like  hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)), (2) in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH) cofactor biosynthesis (GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GTPCH), 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), sepiapterin reductase (SPR)) and recycling (pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD), dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR)), or (3) in co-chaperones (DNAJC12). Clinically, they present early during childhood with a lack of monoamine neurotransmitters, especially dopamine and its products norepinephrine and epinephrine. Classical symptoms include autonomous dysregulations, hypotonia, movement disorders, and developmental delay. Therapy is predominantly based on supplementation of missing cofactors or neurotransmitter precursors. However, diagnosis is difficult and is predominantly based on quantitative detection of neurotransmitters, cofactors, and precursors in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, and blood. This review aims at summarizing the diverse analytical tools routinely used for diagnosis to determine quantitatively the amounts of neurotransmitters and cofactors in the different types of samples used to identify patients suffering from these rare diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31479429>Monocyte glycolysis determines CD8+ T cell functionality in human Chagas disease.</a></h2><p>Chagas disease is a lifelong pathology resulting from Trypanosoma cruzi infection. It represents one of the most frequent causes of heart failure and sudden death in Latin America. Herein, we provide evidence that aerobic glycolytic pathway activation in monocytes drives nitric oxide (NO) production, triggering  nitration (TN) on CD8+ T cells and dysfunction in patients with chronic Chagas disease. Monocytes from patients exhibited a higher frequency of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and increased expression of its target genes/proteins. Nonclassical monocytes are expanded in patients' peripheral blood and represent an important source of NO. Monocytes entail CD8+ T cell surface nitration because both the frequency of nonclassical monocytes and that of NO-producing monocytes positively correlated with the percentage of TN+ lymphocytes. Inhibition of glycolysis in in vitro-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells decreased the inflammatory properties of monocytes/macrophages, diminishing the frequency of IL-1β- and NO-producing cells. In agreement, glycolysis inhibition reduced the percentage of TN+CD8+ T cells, improving their functionality. Altogether, these results clearly show that glycolysis governs oxidative stress on monocytes and modulates monocyte-T cell interplay in human chronic Chagas disease. Understanding the pathological immune mechanisms that sustain an inflammatory environment in human pathology is key to designing improved therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618682>Mutations in NlInR1 affect normal growth and lifespan in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.</a></h2><p>The brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens contains two insulin receptor homologues, designated NlInR1 and NlInR2. NlInR1 is strikingly homologous to the typical InR in insects and vertebrates, containing a ligand-activated intracellular  kinase catalytic domain. Herein, we report an optimized CRISPR/Cas9 system to induce mutations in the NlInR1 locus in BPH, consisting of a Cas9 plasmid that is specifically expressed in the germline via the Nlvasa promoter and versatile sgRNA expression plasmids under the control of the U6 promoter. We systematically evaluated the efficiency of injection mix compositions and demonstrated an appropriate combination of Cas9/sgRNA to target essential genes. Furthermore, we showed that homozygous mutants for the NlInR1 gene are early embryonic lethal, whereas heterozygous mutants grow more slowly, exhibit a severe reduction in body weight and wing size and live longer than the wild type. Interestingly, the severity of the mutant phenotype was different when targeting distinct important domains of the NlInR1 locus. The severity of the mutant phenotype is similar to that of insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway deficiencies in vertebrates, suggesting a conserved function of NlInR1 in the regulation of development and longevity. Global expression profiling suggests that NlInR1 regulates many cellular processes in BPH, including insulin resistance, phototransduction, , endocytosis, longevity, biosynthesis and protein processing. Our results also pave the way for understanding the precise molecular mechanism of insulin signaling in wing polyphenism in insects.Copyright © 2019.

Consequently, disproportionate levels of ROS in relation to antioxidants lead to oxidative stress (OS), which plays a key role in HIV disease progression and pathogenesis. There is a close relationship between oxidative stress status and HIV infection/progression, both separately and in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Biomarkers of oxidative stress present an additional means of monitoring HIV disease progression and/or management. Thus, the objective of this study was to apply untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics followed by targeted quantitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses to identify predictors of oxidative stress in HIV infected individuals, with or without cART. Untargeted NMR-based metabonomics allowed a global profiling of  perturbations in HIV-infected sera. The cohort consisted of 21 HIV-negative control subjects (HIV) and 113 HIV-infected individuals, of which 100 were on cART. Significant differences in  features corresponding to changes in glucose, lipids, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid and branched amino acids were observed, which point to oxidative stress and insulin resistance. To further confirm oxidative stress, targeted GC/MS-based metabonomics, performed in succession, allowed for a quantitative description of a total of 9 oxidative stress-related metabolites. Significant up-regulation of aspartic acid, phenylalanine and glutamic acid were observed in the HIV-infected cohorts as compared to controls. Tryptophan and  were down-regulated whereas cystine levels were increased in HIV-infected and untreated individuals as compared to both HIV treated and negative control subjects. Pathway analysis also revealed 11   to be significantly altered by infection and/or treatment. These  included aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, nitrogen  and phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis. This pilot study demonstrated the use of multiplatform metabonomic strategies to elucidate  markers that would be essential in predicting HIV/cART-induced oxidative stress. This could aid and contribute in HIV treatment and management programmes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TT1 is clinically characterized by acute liver failure, development of hepatocellular carcinoma, renal and neurological problems, and consequently an extremely poor outcome. This review showed that the introduction of 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) in 1992 has revolutionized the outcome of TT1 patients, especially when started pre-clinically. If started early, NTBC can prevent liver failure, renal problems, and neurological attacks and decrease the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. NTBC has been shown to be safe and well tolerated, although the long-term effectiveness of treatment with NTBC needs to be awaited. The high  concentrations caused by treatment with NTBC could result in ophthalmological and skin problems and requires life-long dietary restriction of  and its precursor phenylalanine, which could be strenuous to adhere to. In addition, neurocognitive problems have been reported since the introduction of NTBC, with hypothesized but as yet unproven pathophysiological mechanisms. Further research should be done to investigate the possible relationship between important clinical outcomes and blood concentrations of biochemical parameters such as phenylalanine, , succinylacetone, and NTBC, and to develop clear guidelines for treatment and follow-up with reliable measurements. This all in order to ultimately improve the combined NTBC and dietary treatment and limit possible complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma development, neurocognitive problems, and impaired quality of life.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339875>Identification of Gene Changes Induced by Dexamethasone in the Anterior Segment of the Human Eye Using Bioinformatics Analysis.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND Glucocorticoids (GCs)-induced glaucoma is a common adverse effect of prolonged GCs use. To better understand the effects of GCs on aqueous humor (AH) outflow, we analyzed the dataset GSE37474 using bioinformatics analysis to identify gene changes and  in the anterior segment of the human eye induced by dexamethasone (DEX). MATERIAL AND METHODS The GSE37474 dataset downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was examined in this study. GEO2R was utilized to analyze data and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway were constructed using the DAVID database followed by construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network performed using Cytoscape software. Finally, modules and hub genes were screened out using MCODE and cytoHubba plugin, respectively. RESULTS A set of 252 DEGs were screened. Among the DEGs, 143 genes were upregulated and 109 were downregulated. GO analysis indicated that some of the DEGs participated in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and cholesterol homeostasis. Additionally, KEGG  were predominantly enriched in   and ECM-receptor interaction. From the PPI network, 2 modules were identified, and 10 hub genes were screened out, including CCL2, FOS, IGF1, PTGS2, CCL5, EDN1, IL11, F3, PMCH, and BDKRB1. The 2 module genes primarily participate in the TNF signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and the Jak-STAT signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS The present study identiﬁed some significant DEGs, hub genes, , and modules in the human anterior segment induced by DEX. These results demonstrate that DEX changes the expression of certain genes and  to resist aqueous humor outflow, which could be new targets for developing novel and more effective approaches of diagnosis and therapy for GCs-induced glaucoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385026>Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) as detected by immunohistochemistry is associated with postoperative residual disease in ovarian cancer.</a></h2><p>Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 (FGFR4) was proposed to hold prognostic significance in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). However, information on this deriving from large, representative patient panels is still missing, though such data would be indispensable to validate suitability of FGFR4 as prognostic marker or even pharmacological target.1063 ovarian cancer cases were included in this study. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using two different anti-FGFR4 specific antibodies (HPA027273, sc-124) on an automated staining system. IHC data of both FGFR4 antibodies were available from 995 cases. FGFR4 immunostaining was correlated to prognostic factors including survival using uni- and multivariate proportional hazard models.FGFR4 was positively associated with advanced FIGO stage, high grade and presence of residual disease. When progression free (PFS) of FGFR4 negative vs. positive patients was compared, patients scored as FGFR4 positive had significantly shortened PFS as compared to those that stained negative. All associations of FGFR4 and shortened PFS were lost during multivariate testing. No significant associations were found in terms of OS.We were not able to confirm FGFR4 as an independent negative prognosticator as described before. However, FGFR4 was highly prevalent in those cases harboring residual disease after debulking surgery. Since especially patients that could only be debulked sub-optimally may benefit from targeted adjuvant treatment,  kinase inhibitors targeting FGFRs might turn out to be an interesting future treatment option.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31502448>Isolation and Characterization of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitory Peptides from Peach Seed Hydrolysates: In Vivo Assessment of Antihypertensive Activity.</a></h2><p>A peptide fraction with molecular masses below 3 kDa (PSH-3 kDa) from a peach seed hydrolysate demonstrated high angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity (concentration to inhibit 50% ACE (IC) = 16.4 μg/mL) in our previous work. This work proposes a further study of this highly active fraction. RP-HPLC enabled two fractions (F3 and F4) with high inhibitory activity (IC = 2.0 ± 0.5 and 1.2 ± 0.2 μg/mL, respectively) to be isolated. Peptide analysis by LC-Q-TOF-MS/MS using reverse-phase and hydrophilic interaction chromatography enabled 33 peptides within both fractions to be identified.

Tianshu capsule (TSC), composed of Chuanxiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort) and Tianma (Gastrodiaelata Blume), has been widely used to treat the blood stasis type of headache and migraine in clinic. Results of previous research showed its antihypertensive effects, but the underlying mechanisms were still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of TSC on spontaneously hypertensive rats by H NMR-based metabonomics and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIAS), explore potential biomarkers and targets, and probe the potential mechanism of TSC on antihypertensive treatment. The results showed that TSC could decrease the product of oxidative stress (MDA) and enhance the activities of SOD and GSH-Px, down-regulate the expression of enzymes (LDHA, PKM2 and HK2) related to glycolysis, and perturb the levels of a series of amino acids (isoleucine, alanine, asparagine, citrate, etc.) and . Multivariate statistical analyses showed remarkable changes in some endogenous metabolites after administrating TSC related to oxidative stress, amino acid  and energy  disturbances. Some enzymes (alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase-2,  hydroxylase, dopa decarboxylase, etc.) related to  biomarkers were predicted as the potential targets of TSC treatment on SHRs. The discoveries are helpful to understand the antihypertensive mechanism of TSC and provide theoretical evidence for its future research, development and clinical use.Copyright © 2019 Gao, Wang, Wang, Wang, Wang, Ma, Li, Zhao and Chen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627881>Mechanism of DNA primer synthesis by human PrimPol.</a></h2><p>PrimPol is the second primase discovered in eukaryotic cells, whose function is to restart the stalled replication forks during both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA replication. This chapter revises our current knowledge about the mechanism of synthesis of DNA primers by human PrimPol, and the importance of its distinctive Zn-finger domain (ZnFD). After PrimPol forms a binary complex with ssDNA, the formation of the pre-ternary complex strictly requires the presence of Mn ions to stabilize the interaction of the incoming deoxynucleotide at the 3'-site. The capacity to bind both ssDNA template and 3'-deoxynucleotide was shown to reside in the AEP core of PrimPol, with ZnFD being dispensable at these two early steps of the primase reaction. Sugar selection favoring dNTPs versus NTPs at the 3' site is mediated by a specific  (Tyr) acting as a steric gate. Besides, a specific glutamate residue (Glu) conforming a singular A motif (DxE) promotes the use of Mn to stabilize the pre-ternary complex. Mirroring the function of the PriL subunit of dimeric AEP primases, the ZnFD of PrimPol is crucial to stabilize the initiating 5'-nucleotide, specifically interacting with the gamma-phosphate. Such an interaction is crucial to optimize dimer formation and the subsequent translocation events leading to the processive synthesis of a mature DNA primer. Finally, the capacity of PrimPol to tolerate lesions is discussed in the context of its DNA primase function, and its potential as a TLS primase.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, transplanted stem cell encountered ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury which is a major challenge for stem cell survival. During the acute phase after myocardial infarction (MI) cytokine-rich hostile microenvironment, extensive immune cell infiltration and lack of oxygen have been a bottleneck in cell-based therapy. During prolonged ischemia, intracellular pH and ATP level decrease results in anaerobic  and lactate accumulation. Consequentially, ATPase-dependent ion transport becomes dysfunctional, contributing to calcium overload and cell death by apoptosis and necrosis. Although O level revitalizes upon reperfusion, a surge in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurs with neutrophil infiltration in ischemic tissues further aggravating the injury. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) of stem cells with a repeated short cycle of IR results in the release of chemical signals such as NO, ROS, and adenosine which triggers a cascade of signaling events that activates protein kinase C (PKC), Src protein  kinases, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and subsequently increased synthesis of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Heme oxygenase-1 [HO-1], aldose reductase, Mn superoxide dismutase, and anti-apoptotic genes (Mcl-1, BCl-x, c-FLIP, c-FLIP). Pharmacological preconditioning uses a phosphodiestrase inhibitor, another mode of protecting stem cell or heart per se from impending ischemic injury in two phases. During the early phase of cardioprotection (2 h), PC leads to increased expression of survival factors like BCl/Bax ratio while late phase (24 h) showed activation of the JAK/STAT survival pathway. Phosphorylation of STAT3 at two crucial residues, Tyr-705 and Ser-727, allows its entry inside the nucleus and upregulates the expression of protein kinase G-1 (PKG1) which evokes cardioprotective signaling. To confirm, heart-specific conditional STAT3 knockout mice undergone IR surgery, abolishing late-phase cardioprotective effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554233>Vacuolar H-ATPase Subunit V0C Regulates Aerobic Glycolysis of Esophageal Cancer Cells via PKM2 Signaling.</a></h2><p>The vacuolar H-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) subunit V0C (ATP6V0C), a proton-conducting, pore-forming subunit of vacuolar ATPase, maintains pH homeostasis and induces organelle acidification. The intracellular and extracellular pH of cancer cells affects their growth; however, the role of ATP6V0C in highly invasive esophageal cancer cells (ECCs) remains unclear. In this study, we examined the role of ATP6V0C in glucose  in ECCs. The ATP6V0C depletion attenuated ECC proliferation, invasion, and suppressed glucose , as indicated by reduced glucose uptake and decreased lactate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in cells. Consistent with this, expression of glycolytic enzyme and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were also decreased by ATP6V0C knockdown. Mechanistically, ATP6V0C interacted with pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2), a key regulator of glycolysis in ECCs. The ATP6V0C depletion reduced PKM2 phosphorylation at  residue 105 (Tyr), leading to inhibition of nuclear translocation of PKM2. In addition, ATP6V0C was recruited at hypoxia response element (HRE) sites in the lactate dehydrogenase A () gene for glycolysis. Thus, our data suggest that ATP6V0C enhances aerobic glycolysis and motility in ECCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618863>Plasma Free Amino Acid Responses to Whey Protein and Their Relationships with Gastric Emptying, Blood Glucose- and Appetite-Regulatory Hormones and Energy Intake in Lean Healthy Men.</a></h2><p>This study determined the effects of increasing loads of whey protein on plasma amino acid (AA) concentrations, and their relationships with gastric emptying, blood glucose- and appetite-regulatory hormones, blood glucose and energy intake. Eighteen healthy lean men participated in a double-blinded study, in which they consumed, on 3 separate occasions, in randomised order, 450-mL drinks containing either 30 g (L) or 70 g (H) of pure whey protein isolate, or control with 0 g of protein (C). Gastric emptying, serum concentrations of AAs, ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1), insulin, glucagon and blood glucose were measured before and after the drinks over 180 min. Then energy intake was quantified. All AAs were increased, and 7/20 AAs were increased more by H than L. Incremental areas under the curve (iAUC) for CCK, GLP-1, insulin and glucagon were correlated positively with iAUCs of 19/20 AAs ( < 0.05). The strongest correlations were with the branched-chain AAs as well as lysine, , methionine, tryptophan, and aspartic acid (all R > 0.52,  < 0.05). Blood glucose did not correlate with any AA (all  > 0.05). Ghrelin and energy intake correlated inversely, but only weakly, with 15/20 AAs (all R < 0.34,  < 0.05). There is a strong relationship between gluco-regulatory hormones with a number of (predominantly essential) AAs.

In addition, references have been provided for more in-depth information regarding areas that are not discussed including  kinase activation of PLC. Understanding the roles of the individual PLC enzymes, and their distinct cellular functions, will lead to a better understanding of the physiological roles of these enzymes in the development of diseases and the maintenance of homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31348050>Recent advances in inherited platelet disorders.</a></h2><p>The increasing use of high throughput sequencing and genomic analysis has facilitated the discovery of new causes of inherited platelet disorders. Studies of these disorders and their respective mouse models have been central to understanding their biology, and also in revealing new aspects of platelet function and production. This review covers recent contributions to the identification of genes, proteins and variants associated with inherited platelet defects, and highlights how these studies have provided insights into platelet development and function.Novel genes recently implicated in human platelet dysfunction include the galactose  enzyme UDP-galactose-4-epimerase in macrothrombocytopenia, and erythropoietin-producing hepatoma-amplified sequence receptor transmembrane  kinase EPHB2 in a severe bleeding disorder with deficiencies in platelet agonist response and granule secretion. Recent studies of disease-associated variants established or clarified roles in platelet function and/or production for the membrane receptor G6b-B, the FYN-binding protein FYB1/ADAP, the RAS guanyl-releasing protein RASGRP2/CalDAG-GEFI and the receptor-like protein  phosphatase PTPRJ/CD148. Studies of genes associated with platelet disorders advanced understanding of the cellular roles of neurobeachin-like 2, as well as several genes influenced by the transcription regulator RUNT-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), including NOTCH4.The molecular bases of many hereditary platelet disorders have been elucidated by the application of recent advances in cell imaging and manipulation, genomics and protein function analysis. These techniques have also aided the detection of new disorders, and enabled studies of disease-associated genes and variants to enhance understanding of platelet development and function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592739>Extended Real-World Observation of Patients Treated with Sorafenib for Radioactive Iodine-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma and Impact of Lenvatinib Salvage Treatment: A Korean Multicenter Study.</a></h2><p> Treatment for patients with radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) is challenging. Recently, two  kinase inhibitors (sorafenib and lenvatinib) have been approved and showed benefits for progression-free survival with tolerable adverse events.  This is an extension study of a previous multicenter, retrospective cohort study of real-world experience in treating 98 patients with progressive RAI-refractory DTC with sorafenib. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The efficacy of lenvatinib as salvage therapy after disease progression on first-line sorafenib was evaluated by comparing outcomes in 32 patients who were treated with lenvatinib with 41 patients who were not and therefore served as a no salvage treatment group.  The median OS of all 98 patients treated with sorafenib was 41.5 months, and the median progression-free survival was 13.5 months. Patients without disease-related symptoms before sorafenib treatment had better OS than those with symptoms (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56 [95% confidence interval, CI 0.31-0.99],  = 0.048). Larger tumor size was associated with a minimally increased risk of death (HR = 1.02 [CI 1.00-1.03],  = 0.049). Best tumor response was not associated with OS ( = 0.490). Lenvatinib salvage treatment significantly improved OS in patients receiving it compared with those who did not (HR = 0.28 [CI 0.15-0.53],  < 0.001). The median OS from the time of disease progression after first-line sorafenib treatment was 4.9 months in no salvage treatment group, whereas it was not reached in the lenvatinib salvage group.  The absence of disease-related symptoms and smaller tumor burden was associated with survival benefits of first-line sorafenib treatment in patients with progressive RAI-refractory DTC. Lenvatinib salvage therapy was effective in improving OS in patients with disease progression after first-line sorafenib.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666358>The mitochondrial acyl-carrier protein interaction network highlights important roles for LYRM family members in complex I and mitoribosome assembly.</a></h2><p>NDUFAB1 is the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP) essential for cell viability. Through its pantetheine-4'-phosphate post-translational modification, NDUFAB1 interacts with members of the leucine--arginine motif (LYRM) protein family. Although a number of LYRM proteins have been described to participate in a variety of defined processes, the functions of others remain either partially or entirely unknown. We profiled the interaction network of NDUFAB1 to reveal associations with 9 known LYRM proteins as well as more than 20 other proteins involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex and mitochondrial ribosome assembly. Subsequent knockout and interaction network studies in human cells revealed the LYRM member AltMiD51 to be important for optimal assembly of the large mitoribosome subunit, consistent with recent structural studies. In addition, we used proteomics coupled with topographical heat-mapping to reveal that knockout of LYRM2 impairs assembly of the NADH-dehydrogenase module of complex I, leading to defects in cellular respiration. Together, this work adds to the catalogue of functions executed by LYRM family of proteins in building mitochondrial complexes and emphasises the common and essential role of NDUFAB1 as a protagonist in mitochondrial .Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31325096>Apatinib inhibits glycolysis by suppressing the VEGFR2/AKT1/SOX5/GLUT4 signaling pathway in ovarian cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Apatinib is a  kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2), and has shown encouraging therapeutic effects in various malignant tumors. As yet, however, the role of apatinib in ovarian cancer has remained unknown. Here, we sought to elucidate the role of apatinib in the in vitro and in vivo viability and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, as well as in glucose  in these cells.The effects of apatinib on ovarian cancer cell viability and proliferation were assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays, respectively. The expression of VEGFR2/AKT1/SOX5/GLUT4 pathway proteins was assessed using Western blotting, and glucose uptake and lactate production assays were used to detect glycolysis in ovarian cancer cells. SOX5 was exogenously over-expressed and silenced in ovarian cancer cells using expression vector and shRNA-based methods, respectively. RNA expression analyses were performed using RNA-seq and gene-chip-based methods. GLUT4 promoter activity was assessed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The expression of p-VEGFR2 (Tyr1175), p-AKT1 (Ser473), p-GSK3β (Ser9), SOX5 and GLUT4 in xenograft tissues was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC).We found that apatinib inhibited the in vitro and in vivo viability and proliferation in Hey and OVCA433 ovarian cancer cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. We also found that apatinib effectively suppressed glucose uptake and lactate production by blocking the expression of GLUT4 in these cells. In addition, we found that SOX5 predominantly rescued the inhibitory effect of apatinib on GLUT4 expression by activating its promoter. Finally, we found that apatinib regulated the expression of SOX5 by suppressing the VEGFR2/AKT1/GSK3β signaling pathway.From our results, we conclude that apatinib suppresses the in vitro and in vivo viability and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, as well as glycolysis by inhibiting the VEGFR2/AKT1/GSK3β/SOX5/GLUT4 signaling pathway. Apatinib may serve as a promising drug for the treatment of ovarian cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590338>Metabolomic Perspectives in Antiblastic Cardiotoxicity and Cardioprotection.</a></h2><p>Despite advances in supportive and protective therapy for myocardial function, cardiovascular diseases due to antineoplastic therapy-primarily cardiomyopathy associated with contractile dysfunction-remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Because of the limitations associated with current therapies, investigators are searching for alternative strategies that can timely recognise cardiovascular damage-thus permitting a quick therapeutic approach-or prevent the development of the disease. Damage to the heart can result from both traditional chemotherapeutic agents, such as anthracyclines, and new targeted therapies, such as  kinase inhibitors. In recent years, metabolomics has proved to be a practical tool to highlight fundamental changes in the  state in several pathological conditions.

This is unique relative to white adipose tissue (WAT), which is generally more attuned to  demand. It suggests that there may be regulatory  that are common to both BMAT and WAT and also those that are specific to BMAT alone. The central nervous system (CNS) is a key mediator of adipose tissue function through sympathetic adrenergic neurons. Thus, we hypothesized that central autonomic  may be involved in BMAT regulation. To test this, we first quantified the innervation of BMAT by  hydroxylase (TH) positive nerves within the metaphysis and diaphysis of the tibia of B6 and C3H mice. We found that many of the TH+ axons were concentrated around central blood vessels in the bone marrow. However, there were also areas of free nerve endings which terminated in regions of BMAT adipocytes. Overall, the proportion of nerve-associated BMAT adipocytes increased from proximal to distal along the length of the tibia (from ~3-5 to ~14-24%), regardless of mouse strain. To identify the central  involved in BMAT innervation and compare to peripheral WAT, we then performed retrograde viral tract tracing with an attenuated pseudorabies virus (PRV) to infect efferent nerves from the tibial metaphysis (inclusive of BMAT) and inguinal WAT (iWAT) of C3H mice. PRV positive neurons were identified consistently from both injection sites in the intermediolateral horn of the spinal cord, reticular formation, rostroventral medulla, solitary tract, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, subcoeruleus, Barrington's nucleus, and hypothalamus. We also observed dual-PRV infected neurons within the majority of these regions. Similar tracings were observed in pons, midbrain, and hypothalamic regions from B6 femur and tibia, demonstrating that these results persist across mouse strains and between skeletal sites. Altogether, this is the first quantitative report of BMAT autonomic innervation and reveals common central neuroanatomic , including putative "command" neurons, involved in coordinating multiple aspects of sympathetic output and facilitation of parallel processing between bone marrow/BMAT and peripheral adipose tissue.Copyright © 2019 Wee, Lorenz, Bekirov, Jacquin and Scheller.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611073>Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) regulatory subunits and their roles in signaling and disease.</a></h2><p>The Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a group of heterodimeric lipid kinases that regulate crucial cellular processes including proliferation, survival, growth, and . The diversity in functions controlled by the various catalytic isoforms (p110α, p110β, p110δ, and p110γ) depends on their abilities to be activated by distinct stimuli such as receptor  kinases (RTKs), G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and the Ras family of small G-proteins. A major factor determining the ability of each p110 enzyme to be activated is the presence of regulatory binding partners. Given the overwhelming evidence for the involvement of PI3Ks in diseases such as cancer, inflammation, immunodeficiency and diabetes, an understanding of how these regulatory proteins influence PI3K function is essential.

EGFR has been reported to be overexpressed in up to 78% of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cases suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target. The clinical trials of anti-EGFR agents in breast cancer showed low response rates. However, a subgroup of patients demonstrated response to EGFR inhibitors highlighting the necessity to stratify patients, who might benefit from effective combination therapy that could include anti EGFR-agents. Population variability in EGFR expression warrants systematic evaluation in specific populations.To study EGFR alterations and expressions in a multi ethnic Malaysian TNBC patient cohort to determine the possibility of using anti-EGFR combinatorial therapy for this population.In this study, we evaluated 58 cases of Malaysian TNBC patient samples for EGFR gene copy number alteration and EGFR protein overexpression using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods, respectively.EGFR protein overexpression was observed in about 30% while 15.5% displayed high EGFR copy number including 5.17% gene amplification and over 10% high polysomy. There is a positive correlation between EGFR protein overexpression and gene copy number and over expression of EGFR is observed in ten out of the 48 low copy number cases (20.9%) without gene amplification.This study provides the first glimpse of EGFR alterations and expressions in a multi ethnic Malaysian TNBC patient cohort emphasising the need for the nationwide large scale EGFR expression evaluation in Malaysia.© 2019 Zakaria et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31402706>Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitors as potential anti-diabetes agents: patent review (2015-2018).</a></h2><p>: Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibition has been recommended as a crucial strategy to enhance insulin sensitivity in various cells and this fact is supported by human genetic data. PTP1B inhibitors improve the sensitivity of the insulin receptor and have the ability to cure insulin resistance-related diseases. In the latter years, targeting PTP1B inhibitors is being considered an attractive target to treat T2DM and therefore libraries of PTP1B inhibitors are being suggested as potent antidiabetic drugs. : This review provides an overview of published patents from January 2015 to December 2018. The review describes the effectiveness of potent PTP1B inhibitors as pharmaceutical agents to treat type 2 diabetes. : Enormous developments have been made in PTP1B drug discovery which describes progress in natural products, synthetic heterocyclic scaffolds or heterocyclic hybrid compounds. Various protocols are being followed to boost the pharmacological effects of PTP1B inhibitors. Moreover these new advancements suggest that it is possible to get small-molecule PTP1B inhibitors with the required potency and selectivity.

Protein kinases are ubiquitous intracellular and cell surface proteins that play critical roles in cell signaling  involved in , injury responses, adaption, growth and differentiation. They act by adding a phosphate group to a protein (phosphorylation), usually on a specific amino acid which often makes the protein or enzyme "active". The human genome has more than 500 protein kinases and they can be classified as (1) , (2) serine-theonine or (3) nonspecific (both), based upon their amino acid specificity. Many protein kinases are cell surface receptors and act to initiate an intracellular pathway of activation, after the receptor is engaged by its ligand, typically a cytokine or growth factor. Inhibitors of these kinases are called protein kinase receptor inhibitors. Other kinases are intracellular and take part in cell signaling. These kinases can be targeted by "non-receptor" protein kinases. Finally, some kinase inhibitors have specificity for multiple kinases and are called "multi-kinase inhibitors." Protein kinases can be specifically involved in cell growth, proliferation and differentiation and mutations may lead to unregulated growth and proliferation that is typical of cancerous cells. These mutated protein kinases represent an attractive target for anticancer agents. The potent activity and lack of generalized toxicity of the kinase inhibitors relate to the specificity of antagonist for the mutated protein. In like manner, their toxicity often relates to off-target activity, either to the unmutated kinase or to closely related, normal kinases. The protein kinases can be categorized based upon the amino acid that they phosphorylate: either serine, threonine or . The  kinase receptor inhibitors were the initial and are perhaps the best characterized kinase inhibitors. The protein kinase inhibitors are relatively recently developed agents, all having been introduced since 2001. They are unique and represent a major advance in cancer chemotherapy, away from broadly cytotoxic agents and towards drugs that specifically target the molecular abnormalities of cancer cells. The initial  kinase inhibitor approved for use in the United States was imatinib (Gleevec: 2001) which is used to treat Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has a mutated kinase receptor (BCR-ABL) that is created by the specific translocation that creates the Philadelphia chromosome. Imatinib is a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL kinase. The introduction of this first protein kinase inhibitor was followed by more than a dozen others within the next 10 years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537781>HPD degradation regulated by the TTC36-STK33-PELI1 signaling axis induces tyrosinemia and neurological damage.</a></h2><p>Decreased expression of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase (HPD), a key enzyme for  , is a cause of human tyrosinemia. However, the regulation of HPD expression remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that molecular chaperone TTC36, which is highly expressed in liver, is associated with HPD and reduces the binding of protein kinase STK33 to HPD, thereby inhibiting STK33-mediated HPD T382 phosphorylation. The reduction of HPD T382 phosphorylation results in impaired recruitment of FHA domain-containing PELI1 and PELI1-mediated HPD polyubiquitylation and degradation. Conversely, deficiency or depletion of TTC36 results in enhanced STK33-mediated HPD T382 phosphorylation and binding of PELI1 to HPD and subsequent PELI1-mediated HPD downregulation. Ttc36 mice have reduced HPD expression in the liver and exhibit tyrosinemia, damage to hippocampal neurons, and deficits of learning and memory. These findings reveal a previously unknown regulation of HPD expression and highlight the physiological significance of TTC36-STK33-PELI1-regulated HPD expression in tyrosinemia and tyrosinemia-associated neurological disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430575>Importance of Hypericin-Bcl2 interactions for biological effects at subcellular levels.</a></h2><p>Hypericin (Hyp) is a naturally occurring compound used as photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy and diagnosis. Recently, we have shown that Hyp presence alone, without illumination, resulted in substantial biological effects at several sub-cellular levels. Hyp induced changes in cellular ultrastructure, mitochondria function and , and distribution of Bcl2 proteins in malignant and non-malignant cells. The molecular mechanisms that underlie Hyp light-independent effects are still elusive. We have hypothesized that Bcl2-Hyp interactions might be one possible mechanism. We performed molecular docking studies to determine the Hyp-Bcl2 interaction profile. Based on the interaction profiles small Bcl2 peptide segments were selected for further study. We designed small peptides corresponding to Bcl2 BH3 and BH1 domains and tested the binding of Hyp and Bcl2 known inhibitor, ABT263, to the peptides in computer modeling and in vitro binding studies. We employed endogenous tryptophan and  in the BH3 and BH1 peptides, respectively, and their fluorescent properties to show interaction with Hyp and ABT263. Overall, our results indicate that Hyp can interact with Bcl2 protein at its BH3-BH1 hydrophobic groove, and this interaction may trigger changes in intracellular distribution of Bcl2 proteins. In addition, our computer modeling results suggest that Hyp also interacts with other anti-apoptotic members of Bcl2 family similar to the known BH3 mimetics. Our findings are novel and might contribute to understanding Hyp light-independent effects. In addition, they may substantiate the therapeutic use of Hyp as a BH3 mimetic molecule to enhance other cancer treatments.Copyright © 2019.

To understand the role of FGF21 in regulating tumor aggressiveness in thyroid cancer, serum levels of FGF21 were measured in healthy subjects and patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and expression levels of FGF21, FGF receptors (FGFRs), and β-klotho (KLB) were investigated in human thyroid tissues. The cell viability, migrating cells, and invading cells were measured in PTC cells after treatment with recombinant FGF21. Higher serum levels of FGF21 were found in patients with thyroid cancer than in control participants, and were significantly associated with body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose levels, triglyceride levels, tumor stage, lymphovascular invasion, and recurrence. Serum FGF21 levels were positively correlated with the BMI in patients with PTC, and significantly associated with recurrence. Recombinant FGF21 led to tumor aggressiveness via activation of the FGFR signaling axis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling in PTC cells, and AZD4547, an FGFR  kinase inhibitor, attenuated the effects of FGF21. Hence, FGF21 may be a new biomarker for predicting tumor progression, and targeting FGFR may be a novel therapy for the treatment of obese patients with PTC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480505>Flavonoids and Their Anti-Diabetic Effects: Cellular Mechanisms and Effects to Improve Blood Sugar Levels.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevailing global health  disorder, with an alarming incidence rate and a huge burden on health care providers. DM is characterized by the elevation of blood glucose due either to a defect in insulin synthesis, secretion, binding to receptor, or an increase of insulin resistance. The internal and external factors such as obesity, urbanizations, and genetic mutations could increase the risk of developing DM. Flavonoids are phenolic compounds existing as secondary metabolites in fruits and vegetables as well as fungi. Their structure consists of 15 carbon skeletons and two aromatic rings (A and B) connected by three carbon chains. Flavonoids are furtherly classified into 6 subclasses: flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, flavanols, and anthocyanidins. Naturally occurring flavonoids possess anti-diabetic effects. As in vitro and animal model's studies demonstrate, they have the ability to prevent diabetes and its complications. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge addressing the antidiabetic effects of dietary flavonoids and their underlying molecular mechanisms on selected : Glucose transporter, hepatic enzymes,  kinase inhibitor, AMPK, PPAR, and NF-κB. Flavonoids improve the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications through the regulation of glucose , hepatic enzymes activities, and a lipid profile. Most studies illustrate a positive role of specific dietary flavonoids on diabetes, but the mechanisms of action and the side effects need more clarification. Overall, more research is needed to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of diabetes treatment using flavonoids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499054>Metabolomic study of the protective effect of Gandi capsule for diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the one of the leading causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in clinical. However, it is still lack of accurate biomarkers and effective methods for diagnosing and curing DN. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a definite strategy for the identification of reliable and versatile biomarkers for risk assessment of DN and search for therapeutic approaches that can effectively attenuate DN progression. Treatment with Gandi capsule (GDC) not only decreased the levels of urinary albumin excretion, but also increased the levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), indicating that it produces a renal protective effect on diabetic nephropathy. Based on metabolomics investigation including UHPLC-MS analysis and multivariate statistical analysis, sixteen disordered metabolites were screened out and considered as potential biomarkers corresponding to DN, which were mostly improved and partially returned to normalcy in GDC treatment group. Therefore, it was suggested that GDC was a promising therapeutic agent against DN. The underlying mechanisms of GDC attenuating the development of DN may be improving abnormal  disorders by retrieving the imbalance of glycine , tryptophan , valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, purine , nitrotoluene degradation, phenylalanine , fatty acid ,   and bile acid  .

T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy  and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and  632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and  632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31318922>Gas6/Axl signaling attenuates alveolar inflammation in ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute lung injury by up-regulating SOCS3-mediated pathway.</a></h2><p>Axl is a cell surface receptor  kinase, and activation of the Axl attenuates inflammation induced by various stimuli. Growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) has high affinity for Axl receptor. The role of Gas6/Axl signaling in ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute lung injury (IR-ALI) has not been explored previously. We hypothesized that Gas6/Axl signaling regulates IR-induced alveolar inflammation via a pathway mediated by suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3).IR-ALI was induced by producing 30 min of ischemia followed by 90 min of reperfusion in situ in an isolated and perfused rat lung model. The rats were randomly allotted to a control group and IR groups, which were treated with three different doses of Gas6. Mouse alveolar epithelium MLE-12 cells were cultured in control and hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) conditions with or without Gas6 and Axl inhibitor R428 pretreatment.We found that Gas6 attenuated IR-induced lung edema, the production of proinflammatory cytokines in perfusates, and the severity of ALI ex vivo. IR down-regulated SOCS3 expression and up-regulated NF-κB, and Gas6 restored this process. In the model of MLE-12 cells with HR, Gas6 suppressed the activation of TRAF6 and NF-κB by up-regulating SOCS3. Axl expression of alveolar epithelium was suppressed in IR-ALI but Gas6 restored phosphorylation of Axl. The anti-inflammatory effect of Gas6 was antagonized by R428, which highlighted that phosphorylation of Axl mediated the protective role of Gas6 in IR-ALI.Gas6 up-regulates phosphorylation of Axl on alveolar epithelium in IR-ALI. The Gas6/Axl signaling activates the SOCS3-mediated pathway and attenuates IR-related inflammation and injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614337> impact of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma: Targeted metabolomics in patients before and after tumor removal.</a></h2><p>Excess catecholamine release by pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL) leads to characteristic clinical features and increased morbidity and mortality.

Application of a novel kinetic model identified a pattern of dysfunctional steps contributing to norepinephrine deficiency. We then tested predictions from the model in a new cohort of Parkinson disease patients.Rate constants were calculated for 17 reactions determining intra-neuronal norepinephrine stores. Model predictions were tested by measuring post-mortem apical ventricular concentrations and concentration ratios of catechols in controls and patients with Parkinson disease.The model identified low rate constants for three types of processes in the Lewy body group-catecholamine biosynthesis via  hydroxylase and L-aromatic-amino-acid decarboxylase, vesicular storage of dopamine and norepinephrine, and neuronal norepinephrine reuptake via the cell membrane norepinephrine transporter. Post-mortem catechols and catechol ratios confirmed this triad of model-predicted functional abnormalities.Denervation-independent impairments of neurotransmitter biosynthesis, vesicular sequestration, and norepinephrine recycling contribute to the myocardial norepinephrine deficiency attending Lewy body diseases. A proportion of cardiac sympathetic nerves are "sick but not dead," suggesting targeted disease-modification strategies might retard clinical progression.This study was not a clinical trial.The research reported here was supported by the Division of Intramural Research, NINDS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417255>Ferumoxytol and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 2395 synergistically enhance antitumor activity of macrophages against NSCLC with EGFR mutation.</a></h2><p> Drug resistance is a major challenge for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)- kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment of lung cancer. Ferumoxytol (FMT) drives macrophage (MΦ) transformation towards a M1-like phenotype and thereby inhibits tumor growth. CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 2395 (CpG), a toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist, is an effective therapeutic agent to induce anticancer immune responses. Herein, the effect of co-administered FMT and CpG on MΦ activation for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was explored.  The mRNA expression levels of M1-like genes in RAW 264.7 MΦ cells stimulated by FMT, CpG and FMT and CpG (FMT/CpG) were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Then, the effects of FMT/CpG-pretreated MΦ supernatant on apoptosis and proliferation of H1975 cells were detected by flow cytometry, and the expression of EGFR and its downstream signaling pathway in H1975 cells were explored by western blotting. Finally, a H1975 cell xenograft mouse model was used to study the anti-tumor effect of the combination of FMT and CpG in vivo.  FMT and CpG synergistically enhanced M1-like gene expression in MΦ, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). FMT/CpG-pretreated MΦ supernatant inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of H1975 cells, accompanied by down-regulation of cell cycle-associated proteins and up-regulation of apoptosis-related proteins. Further studies indicated that the FMT/CpG-pretreated MΦ supernatant suppressed p-EGFR and its downstream AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway in H1975 cells. Furthermore, FMT/CpG suppressed tumor growth in mice accompanied by a decline in the EGFR-positive tumor cell fraction and increased M1 phenotype macrophage infiltration.  FMT acted synergistically with CpG to activate MΦ for suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis of NSCLC cells via EGFR signaling. Thus, combining FMT and CpG is an effective strategy for the treatment of NSCLC with EGFR mutation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31368625>Impact of tumor microenvironment on the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor- kinase inhibitors in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>We retrospectively investigated the impact of the tumor microenvironment (TME) on the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)- kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as first-line treatment in 70 patients with advanced EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer and who were seen at Osaka City University Hospital (Osaka, Japan) between August 2013 and December 2017. Using immunohistochemical staining with 28-8 and D7U8C Abs, the tumor proportion score was assessed for programmed cell death-1 ligand-1 (PD-L1), as high (50% or more) or low (less than 50%), and ligand-2 (PD-L2) expression, respectively. The extent of CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was evaluated on a scale of 0-3, with 0-1 as low and 2-3 as high. The TME of the 52 evaluable pretreatment specimens was categorized into 4 subtypes, according to the respective PD-L1 tumor proportion and CD8 scores, as follows: (a) high/high (13.5%, n = 7); (b) low/low (42.3%, n = 22); (c) high/low (17.3%, n = 9); and (d) low/high (26.9%, n = 14). Expression of PD-L2 was significantly the highest in type 1 (57.1% vs 4.5% vs 11.1% vs 7.1%, respectively; P = .0090). Response rate was significantly the lowest in type 1 (14.3% vs 81.8% vs 66.7% vs 78.6%, respectively; P = .0085). Progression-free survival was the shortest in type 1 and the longest in type 4 (median, 2.4 vs 11.3 vs 8.4 vs 17.5 months, respectively; P = .00000077). The efficacy of EGFR-TKIs differed according to the TME, and the phenotype with high PD-L1 and CD8 expression might be the subset that would poorly benefit from such treatment.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we report on a retrospective analysis of two patients (patients 1 and 2) who had liver metastases and high simvastatin exposure prior to osimertinib treatment, which changed following treatment. Patients received single oral doses of simvastatin 40 mg on day (D) 1 and D31, and osimertinib 80 mg once daily on D3-32. At baseline, both patients had abnormal liver function tests (LFTs; Child-Pugh scores of 6 and 8, respectively), significant liver metastasis, and, after a single simvastatin dose, had higher (~ 10-fold) exposure compared with all other patients. Following 31 days of continuous osimertinib treatment, simvastatin exposures (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C )) and LFTs, such as alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin normalized to population mean values. Additionally, ~ 50% and ~ 80% reductions in liver metastases were observed on computed tomography scans in patients 1 and 2, respectively. High simvastatin exposure on D1 likely resulted from impairment of hepatic first pass  due to liver metastases. Reduction in hepatic disease burden due to osimertinib treatment likely resulted in liver function returning to normal levels.© 2019 AstraZeneca.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) is thought to play multiple roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular energy . We recently reported that altering PGC-1α gene expression modulates mitochondrial functions in N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP) treated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, possibly via the regulation of Estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression. In the present study, we aimed to further investigate the potential beneficial effects of PGC-1α in the substantia nigra of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treated C57BL mice.The overexpression or knockdown of the PGC-1α gene in the mouse model of dopaminergic neurotoxicity was performed using a stereotactic injection of lentivirus in MPTP-treated male C57BL/6 mice. Mice were randomly assigned to one of 6 groups (n=24 per group): normal saline (NS) intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) (con); MPTP i.p. (M); solvent of the lentivirus striatal injection (lentivirus control) + MPTP i.p. (LVcon+M); lentivirus striatal injection + MPTP i.p. (LV+M); LV-PGC-1α striatum injection + MPTP i.p. (LVPGC+M); and LV-PGC-1α-siRNA striatal injection + MPTP i.p. (LVsiRNA+M). Intraperitoneal injections of MPTP/NS were conducted two weeks after lentivirus injection.We found significant improvement in motor behavior and increases in  hydroxylase expression in the substantia nigra (SN) in the brains of mice in the LVPGC+M group. The opposite tendency was observed in those in the LVsiRNA+M group. The expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the SN region was also consistent with the changes in PGC-1α expression. Electron microscopy showed an increasing trend in the mitochondrial density in the LVPGC+M group and a decreasing trend in the M and LVsiRNA+M groups compared to that in the controls.Our results indicated that PGC-1α rescues the effects of MPTP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in C57BL mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664798>Hepatocellular Carcinoma [Internet].</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, has become a major global health problem. Although the risk factors for HCC development are well known and great advances have been made through HBV vaccinations, direct-acting antivirals for HCV treatment, and aflatoxin eradication programs, the overall incidence and mortality rates of HCC are still rising.

In this study, we evaluated whether administration of  () KBL375 isolated from healthy Korean feces improves the atopic dermatitis using the house dust mite ()-induced atopic dermatitis (AD) mouse model. Administration of  KBL375 significantly decreased dermatitis score, ear and dorsal thickness, and serum immunoglobulin E level in AD-induced mice. Significant reductions in mast cells and eosinophils were discovered in skin tissues from  KBL375-treated mice. T helper 2 cell-related cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-31 significantly decreased, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 or transforming growth factor-β increased in skin tissues from  KBL375-treated mice. In addition to phenotypic changes in skin tissues,  KBL375 treatment induced an increase in the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cell population in mesenteric lymph nodes. Taxonomic and functional analyses of gut microbiota showed significantly higher cecum bacterial diversities and abundances including genus , and  in  KBL375-treated mice.  analysis of the cecum also showed significant changes in the levels of various amino acids including methionine, phenylalanine, serine, and , as well as short chain fatty acids such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate in AD-induced mice due to  KBL375 treatment. These altered metabolites in AD-induced mice returned to the levels similar to those in control mice when treated with  KBL375.

Abrus cantoniensis Hance (AC), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been used as a folk medicine for treating hepatitis in China from ancient times. However, its active ingredients are still unclear.Our previous study indicated that saponins extracted from AC (ACS) were the active anti-HBV ingredients in AC. This study aimed to further investigate the anti-HBV effect of ACS in vitro and in vivo.HepG2.2.15 cells which consecutively produce HBV DNA and HBV antigens were used for in vitro test, and C57BL/6 mice infected by a recombinant adeno-associated virus 8 vector carrying 1.3 copies of HBV genome (rAAV8-HBV1.3) were used for in vivo test. The histopathological changes and the immune indices were evaluated in mice model. Genechip was conducted to identify genes and  regulated by ACS in HepG2.2.15 cells.In this study, we confirmed that ACS treatment prominently inhibited production of HBV DNA, Hepatitis Be Antigen (HBeAg), and Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in HepG2.2.15 cells. ACS treatment also decreased serum HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA level in rAAV8-1.3HBV transfected mice, which is in accordance with the in vitro results. Moreover, HBV infection-induced liver inflammation was significantly relieved by ACS, which could be observed in H&E staining and immunohistochemistry of HBcAg. ACS treatment elevated IFN-γ level in mice serum and increased CD4 T cell percentage in splenocytes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that phenylalanine  pathway and   pathway were greatly regulated by ACS treatment.ACS exerted potent inhibitory effects on HBV replication both in vivo and in vitro, which may provide basis for its potential clinical usage.Copyright © 2019.

However, the biological mechanisms responsible for these associations remain largely unknown. In order to gain insight into the  processes driving the association of leukocyte telomere length (LTL) with age-related diseases, we investigated the association between LTL and serum metabolite levels in 7,853 individuals from seven independent cohorts. LTL was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the levels of 131 serum metabolites were measured with mass spectrometry in biological samples from the same blood draw. With partial correlation analysis, we identified six metabolites that were significantly associated with LTL after adjustment for multiple testing: lysophosphatidylcholine acyl C17:0 (lysoPC a C17:0, p-value = 7.1 × 10), methionine (p-value = 9.2 × 10),  (p-value = 2.1 × 10), phosphatidylcholine diacyl C32:1 (PC aa C32:1, p-value = 2.4 × 10), hydroxypropionylcarnitine (C3-OH, p-value = 2.6 × 10), and phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C38:4 (PC ae C38:4, p-value = 9.0 × 10). Pathway analysis showed that the three phosphatidylcholines and methionine are involved in homocysteine  and we found supporting evidence for an association of lipid  with LTL. In conclusion, we found longer LTL associated with higher levels of lysoPC a C17:0 and PC ae C38:4, and with lower levels of methionine, , PC aa C32:1, and C3-OH.

Prognostic value of LCK was validated using IHC in an independent set of 72 HGSOC. Prognostic performance of LCK was compared to cytolytic score (CYT) using RNAseq across multiple tumor types. Differentially expressed genes in LCK high samples and gene ontology enrichment were analyzed.High pre-treatment LCK mRNA expression was found to be a strong predictor of survival in a set of 535 ovarian cancers. Patients with high LCK mRNA expression had a longer median progression free survival (PFS) of 29.4 months compared to 16.9 months in those without LCK high expression (p = 0.003), and longer median overall survival (OS) of 95.1 months versus 44.5 months (p = 0.001), which was confirmed in an independent cohort by IHC (p = 0.04). LCK expression was compared to CYT across tumor types available in the TCGA and was a significant predictor of prognosis in HGSOC where CYT was not predictive. Unexpectedly, LCK high samples also were enriched in numerous immunoglobulin-related and other B cell transcripts.LCK is a better prognostic factor than CYT in ovarian cancer.

In most patients, DAs achieve tumor shrinkage and normoprolactinemia at well tolerated doses. However, primary or, less often, secondary resistance to DAs may be also encountered representing challenging clinical scenarios. This is particularly true for aggressive prolactinomas in which surgery and radiotherapy may not achieve tumor control. In these cases, alternative medical treatments have been considered but data on their efficacy should be interpreted within the constraints of publication bias and of lack of relevant clinical trials. The limited reports on somatostatin analogues have shown conflicting results, but cases with optimal outcomes have been documented. Data on estrogen modulators and metformin are scarce and their usefulness remains to be evaluated. In many aggressive lactotroph tumors, temozolomide has demonstrated optimal outcomes, whereas for other cytotoxic agents,  kinase inhibitors and for inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), higher quality evidence is needed.

Here we report the crystal structures of three homologous, single-layer, anti-parallel β-sheet proteins, comprised of three or four twisted β-hairpin repeats. The structures reveal that, in addition to the hydrogen bond network characteristic of β-sheets, additional hydrophobic interactions mediated by small clusters of residues adjacent to the turns likely play a significant role in the structural stability and compensate for the lack of a compact hydrophobic core. These structures enabled identification of a family of secreted proteins that are broadly distributed in bacteria from the human gut microbiome and are putatively involved in the  of complex carbohydrates.

However, its extensive  following ingestion has resulted in difficulty elucidating precise mechanisms of action. In this study, we aimed to characterize the antiplatelet mechanisms of two methylated metabolites of quercetin-isorhamnetin and tamarixetin-and explore potential interactions with aspirin. Isorhamnetin and tamarixetin inhibited human platelet aggregation, and suppressed activatory processes including granule secretion, integrin αIIbβ3 function, calcium mobilization, and spleen  kinase (Syk)/linker for activation of T cells (LAT) phosphorylation downstream of glycoprotein VI with similar potency to quercetin. All three flavonoids attenuated thrombus formation in an in vitro microfluidic model, and isoquercetin, a 3-O-glucoside of quercetin, inhibited thrombosis in a murine laser injury model. Isorhamnetin, tamarixetin, and quercetin enhanced the antiplatelet effects of aspirin more-than-additively in a plate-based aggregometry assay, reducing aspirin IC  values by an order of magnitude, with this synergy maintained in a whole blood test of platelet function. Our data provide mechanistic evidence for the antiplatelet activity of two quercetin metabolites, isorhamnetin and tamarixetin, and suggest a potential antithrombotic role for these flavonoids.

Paragangliomas are essentially the extra-adrenal counterparts of pheochromocytomas. As such this family of tumors can be subdivided into head and neck paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas and thoracic and abdominal extra-adrenal paragangliomas. Ten out of fifteen genes that contribute to the development of paragangliomas are more susceptible to the development of head and neck paragangliomas when mutated. Gene expression profiling revealed that pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas can be classified into two main clusters (C1 and C2) based on transcriptomes. These groups were defined according to their mutational status and as such strongly associated with specific tumorigenic . The influence of the main genetic drivers on the somatic molecular phenotype was shown by DNA methylation and miRNA profiling. Certain subunits of succinate dehydrogenase (SDHx), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and transmembrane protein 127 (TMEM127) still have the highest impact on development of head and neck paragangliomas. The link between RAS proteins and the formation of pheochromocytoma and paragangliomas is clear due to the effect of receptor -protein kinase (RET) and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in RAS signaling and recent discovery of the role of HRAS. The functions of MYC-associated factor X (MAX) and prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) mutations in the contribution to the pathogenesis of paragangliomas still remain unclear. Ongoing studies give us insight into the incidence of germline and somatic mutations, thus offering guidelines to early detection.

During ageing the CB exhibits a decline in its functionality, demonstrated by decreased hypoxic responses. In aged rats (20-24 months old) there is a decrease in: basal and hypoxic release of adenosine and ATP from the CB; expression of adenosine and ATP receptors in the petrosal ganglion; carotid sinus nerve (CSN) activity in response to hypoxia; and ventilatory responses to ischaemic hypoxia. There is also an increase in SNAP25, ENT1 and CD73 expression. It is concluded that, although CSN activity and ventilatory responses to hypoxia decrease with age, adjustments in purinergic  in the CB in aged animals are present aiming to maintain the contribution of adenosine and ATP. The possible significance of the findings in the context of ageing and in CB-associated pathologies is considered.During ageing the carotid body (CB) exhibits a decline in its functionality. Here we investigated the effect of ageing on functional CB characteristics as well as the contribution of adenosine and ATP to CB chemosensory activity. Experiments were performed in 3-month-old and 20- to 24-month-old male Wistar rats. Ageing decreased: the number of  hydroxylase immune-positive cells, but not type II cells or nestin-positive cells in the CB; the expression of P2X and A receptors in the petrosal ganglion; and the basal and hypoxic release of adenosine and ATP from the CB. Ageing increased ecto-nucleotidase (CD73) immune-positive cells and the expression of synaptosome associated protein 25 (SNAP25) and equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) in the CB. Additionally, ageing did not modify basal carotid sinus nerve (CSN) activity or the activity in response to hypercapnia, but decreased CSN activity in hypoxia. The contribution of adenosine and ATP to stimuli-evoked CSN chemosensory activity in aged animals followed the same pattern of 3-month-old animals. Bilateral common carotid occlusions during 5, 10 and 15 s increased ventilation proportionally to the duration of ischaemia, an effect decreased by ageing. ATP contributed around 50% to ischaemic-ventilatory responses in young and aged rats; the contribution of adenosine was dependent on the intensity of ischaemia, being maximal in ischaemias of 5 s (50%) and much smaller in 15 s ischaemias. Our results demonstrate that both ATP and adenosine contribute to CB chemosensory activity in ageing. Though CB responses to hypoxia, but not to hypercapnia, decrease with age, the relative contribution of both ATP and adenosine for CB activity is maintained.© 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, this report assigned to explore the impact of ZVFe NPs on the amyloidogenicity and cytotoxicity of α-synuclein as one of the many known amyloid proteins.The characterization of α-synuclein at amyloidogenic condition either alone or with ZVFe NPs was carried out by fluorescence, CD, UV-visible spectroscopic methods, TEM study, docking, and molecular modeling. The cytotoxicity assay of α-synuclein amyloid in the absence and presence of ZVFe NPs was also done by MTT, LDH, and flow cytometry analysis.ThT fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that ZVFe NPs shorten the lag phase and accelerate the fibrillation rate of α-synuclein. Nile red and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, CD, Congo red adsorption, and TEM studies indicated that ZVFe NP increased the propensity of α-synuclein into the amyloid fibrillation. Molecular docking study revealed that hydrophilic residues, such as Ser-9 and Lys-12 provide proper sites for hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions with adsorbed water molecules on ZVFe NPs, respectively. Molecular dynamics study determined that the interacted protein shifted from a natively discorded conformation toward a more packed structure. Cellular assay displayed that the cytotoxicity of α-synuclein amyloid against SH-SY5Y cells in the presence of ZVFe NPs is greater than the results obtained without ZVFe NPs.In conclusion, the existence of ZVFe NPs promotes α-synuclein fibrillation at amyloidogenic conditions by forming a potential template for nucleation, the growth of α-synuclein fibrillation and induced cytotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311498>GC content of vertebrate exome landscapes reveal areas of accelerated protein evolution.</a></h2><p>Rapid accumulation of vertebrate genome sequences render comparative genomics a powerful approach to study macro-evolutionary events. The assessment of phylogenic relationships between species routinely depends on the analysis of sequence homology at the nucleotide or protein level.We analyzed mRNA GC content, codon usage and divergence of orthologous proteins in 55 vertebrate genomes. Data were visualized in genome-wide landscapes using a sliding window approach. Landscapes of GC content reveal both evolutionary conservation of clustered genes, and lineage-specific changes, so that it was possible to construct a phylogenetic tree that closely matched the classic "tree of life". Landscapes of GC content also strongly correlated to landscapes of amino acid usage: positive correlation with glycine, alanine, arginine and proline and negative correlation with phenylalanine, , methionine, isoleucine, asparagine and lysine. Peaks of GC content correlated strongly with increased protein divergence.Landscapes of base- and amino acid composition of the coding genome opens a new approach in comparative genomics, allowing identification of discrete regions in which protein evolution accelerated over deep evolutionary time. Insight in the evolution of genome structure may spur novel studies assessing the evolutionary benefit of genes in particular genomic regions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392592>First Genome-wide Association Analysis for Growth Traits in the Largest Coral Reef-Dwelling Bony Fishes, the Giant Grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus).</a></h2><p>The giant grouper, Epinephelus lanceolatus, is the largest coral reef-dwelling bony fish species. However, despite extremely fast growth performance and the considerable economic importance in this species, its genetic regulation of growth remains unknown. Here, we performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for five growth traits in 289 giant groupers using 42,323 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). We identified a total of 36 growth-related SNPs, of which 11 SNPs reached a genome-wide significance level. The phenotypic variance explained by these SNPs varied from 7.09% for body height to 18.42% for body length. Moreover, 22 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for growth traits, including nine significant QTLs and 13 suggestive QTLs, were found on multiple chromosomes. Interestingly, the QTL (LG17: 6934451) was shared between body weight and body height, while two significant QTLs (LG7: 22596399 and LG15: 11877836) for body length were consistent with the associated regions of total length at the genome-wide suggestive level. Eight potential candidate genes close to the associated SNPs were selected for expression analysis, of which four genes (phosphatidylinositol transfer protein cytoplasmic 1, protein  phosphatase receptor type E, alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 17C, and vascular endothelial growth factor A-A) were differentially expressed and involved in , development, response stress, etc. This study improves our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of growth in the giant grouper. The results contribute to the selective breeding of grouper species and the conservation of coral reef fishes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298518>Effects of an Additional Cysteine Residue of Avenin-like b Protein by Site-Directed Mutagenesis on Dough Properties in Wheat ( L.).</a></h2><p>Avenin-like b protein is rich in cysteine residues, providing the possibility to form intermolecular disulfide bonds and then participate in glutenin polymerization. Site-directed mutagenesis was adopted to produce mutant  gene encoding mutant avenin-like b protein, in which one  codon at the C-terminal is substituted by a cysteine codon. Compared with the control lines, both transgenic lines with wild-type and mutant  genes demonstrated superior dough properties. While compared within the transgenic lines, the mutant lines showed relative weaker dough strength and decreased sodium-dodecyl-sulfate sedimentation volumes (from 69.7 mL in line WT alb-1 to 41.0 mL in line Mut alb-4). These inferior dough properties were accompanied by the lower contents of large-sized glutenin polymers, the decreased particle diameters of glutenin macropolymer (GMP), due to the lower content of intermolecular β-sheets (from 39.48% for line WT alb-2 to 30.21% for line Mut alb-3) and the varied contents of disulfide bonds (from 137.37 μmol/g for line WT alb-1 to 105.49 μmol/g for line Mut alb-4) in wheat dough. The extra cysteine might alter the original disulfide bond structure, allowing cysteine residue usually involved in an intermolecular disulfide bond to become available for an intrachain disulfide bond. Avenin-like b proteins were detected in glutenin macropolymers, providing further evidence for this protein to participate in the polymerization of glutenin. This is the first time to investigate the effect of a specific cysteine residue in the avenin-like b protein on flour quality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601906>Disruption of hmgA by DNA Duplication is Responsible for Hyperpigmentation in a Vibrio anguillarum Strain.</a></h2><p>Vibrio anguillarum 531A, isolated from a diseased fish in the Atlantic Ocean, is a mixture composed of about 95 and 5% of highly pigmented cells (strain 531Ad) and cells with normal levels of pigmentation (strain 531Ac), respectively. Analysis of the V. anguillarum 531Ad DNA region encompassing genes involved in the   showed a 410-bp duplication within the hmgA gene that results in a frameshift and early termination of translation of the homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase. We hypothesized that this mutation results in accumulation of homogentisate that is oxidized and polymerized to produce pyomelanin. Introduction in E. coli of recombinant clones carrying the V. anguillarum hppD (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate-dioxygenase), and a mutated hmgA produced brown colored colonies. Complementation with a recombinant clone harboring hmgA restored the original color to the colonies confirming that in the absence of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase the intermediary in  catabolism homogentisate accumulates and undergoes nonenzymatic oxidation and polymerization resulting in high amounts of the brown pigment. Whole-genome sequence analysis showed that V. anguillarum 531 Ac and 531Ad differ in the hmgA gene mutation and 23 mutations, most of which locate to intergenic regions and insertion sequences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31429767>Dapagliflozin improves left ventricular remodeling and aorta sympathetic tone in a pig model of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.</a></h2><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a difficult disease with high morbidity and mortality rates and lacks an effective treatment. Here, we report the therapeutic effect of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), on hypertension + hyperlipidemia-induced HFpEF in a pig model.HFpEF pigs were established by infusing a combination of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and angiotensin II (Ang II), and Western diet (WD) feeding for 18 weeks. In the 9th week, half of the HFpEF pigs were randomly assigned to receive additional dapagliflozin treatment (10 mg/day) by oral gavage daily for the next 9 weeks. Blood pressure, lipid levels, echocardiography and cardiac hemodynamics for cardiac structural and functional changes, as well as epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations in the plasma and tissues were measured. After sacrifice, cardiac fibrosis, the distribution of  hydroxylase (TH), inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α) and NO-cGMP-PKG pathway activity in the cardiovascular system were also determined.Blood pressure, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were markedly increased in HFpEF pigs, but only blood pressure was significantly decreased after 9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment. By echocardiographic and hemodynamic assessment, dapagliflozin significantly attenuated heart concentric remodeling in HFpEF pigs, but failed to improve diastolic function and compliance with the left ventricle (LV). In the dapagliflozin treatment group, TH expression and norepinephrine concentration in the aorta were strongly mitigated compared to that in the HFpEF group. Moreover, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α in aortic tissue were markedly elevated in HFpEF pigs and inhibited by dapagliflozin. Furthermore, the reduced expression of eNOS and the PKG-1 protein and the cGMP content in the aortas of HFpEF pigs were significantly restored after 9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment.9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment decreases hypertension and reverses LV concentric remodeling in HFpEF pigs partly by restraining sympathetic tone in the aorta, leading to inhibition of the inflammatory response and NO-cGMP-PKG pathway activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301059>Effects of Potential Probiotic Strains on the Fecal Microbiota and Metabolites of D-Galactose-Induced Aging Rats Fed with High-Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>Both aging and diet play an important role in influencing the gut ecosystem. Using premature senescent rats induced by D-galactose and fed with high-fat diet, this study aims to investigate the effects of different potential probiotic strains on the dynamic changes of fecal microbiome and metabolites. In this study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with high-fat diet and injected with D-galactose for 12 weeks to induce aging. The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum DR7, L. fermentum DR9, and L. reuteri 8513d administration on the fecal microbiota profile, short-chain fatty acids, and water-soluble compounds were analyzed. It was found that the administration of the selected strains altered the gut microbiota diversity and composition, even at the phylum level. The fecal short-chain fatty acid content was also higher in groups that were administered with the potential probiotic strains. Analysis of the fecal water-soluble metabolites revealed that administration of L. plantarum DR7 and L. reuteri 8513d led to higher fecal content of compounds related to amino acid  such as tryptophan, leucine, , cysteine, methionine, valine, and lysine; while administration of L. fermentum DR9 led to higher prevalence of compounds related to carbohydrate  such as erythritol, xylitol, and arabitol. In conclusion, it was observed that different strains of lactobacilli can cause difference alteration in the gut microbiota and the metabolites, suggesting the urgency to explore the specific  impact of specific strains on the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413564>Arsenic sulfide nanoformulation induces erythroid differentiation in chronic myeloid leukemia cells through degradation of BCR-ABL.</a></h2><p>Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder due to the existence of BCR-ABL fusion protein that allows the cells to keep proliferating uncontrollably. Although  kinase inhibitors can inhibit the activity of BCR-ABL fusion protein to trigger the cells apoptosis, drug resistance or intolerance exists in part of CML patients. Arsenic sulfide in its raw form (r-AsS) can be orally administrated and certain therapeutic effects have been found out in the treatment of hematologic malignancies through inducing cell apoptosis.In this work, a water-dissolvable arsenic sulfide nanoformualtion (ee-AsS) composed of AsS particulates with 470 nm in diameter and encapsulated by a kind of hydrophilic polymer was fabricated and applied to the CML cell line K562, K562/AO2 and primary cells from the bone marrow of CML patients.Results showed that instead of inhibiting the activity of BCR-ABL, ee-AsS induced direct degradation of BCR-ABL in K562 cells within 6 hr incubation, followed by the occurrence of erythroid differentiation in K562 after 72 hr incubation, evidenced by the significantly upregulated CD235a and benzidine staining, which was not detectable with r-AsS. The ee-AsS-induced erythroid differentiation was also observed in K562/AO2 cells and bone marrow mononuclear cells of CML patients. Mechanistic studies indicated that ee-AsS induced autophagy by downregulating the level of intracellular ROS and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α significantly, which led to the subsequent degradation of BCR-ABL. When the concentration was increased, ee-AsS induced much more significant apoptosis and cell cycle arrest than r-AsS, and the cytotoxicity of the former was about 178 times of the latter.ee-AsS was capable of inducing significant erythroid differentiation of CML cells by inducing the direct degradation of BCR-ABL; the new effect could improve hematopoietic function of CML patients as well as inhibit the leukemic cell proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531707>Co-ingestion of whey protein hydrolysate with milk minerals rich in calcium potently stimulates glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion: an RCT in healthy adults.</a></h2><p>To examine whether calcium type and co-ingestion with protein alter gut hormone availability.Healthy adults aged 26 ± 7 years (mean ± SD) completed three randomized, double-blind, crossover studies. In all studies, arterialized blood was sampled postprandially over 120 min to determine GLP-1, GIP and PYY responses, alongside appetite ratings, energy expenditure and blood pressure. In study 1 (n = 20), three treatments matched for total calcium content (1058 mg) were compared: calcium citrate (CALCITR); milk minerals rich in calcium (MILK MINERALS); and milk minerals rich in calcium plus co-ingestion of 50 g whey protein hydrolysate (MILK MINERALS + PROTEIN). In study 2 (n = 6), 50 g whey protein hydrolysate (PROTEIN) was compared to MILK MINERALS + PROTEIN. In study 3 (n = 6), MILK MINERALS was compared to the vehicle of ingestion (water plus sucralose; CONTROL).MILK MINERALS + PROTEIN increased GLP-1 incremental area under the curve (iAUC) by ~ ninefold (43.7 ± 11.1 pmol L 120 min; p < 0.001) versus both CALCITR and MILK MINERALS, with no difference detected between CALCITR (6.6 ± 3.7 pmol L 120 min) and MILK MINERALS (5.3 ± 3.5 pmol L 120 min; p > 0.999). MILK MINERALS + PROTEIN produced a GLP-1 iAUC ~ 25% greater than PROTEIN (p = 0.024; mean difference: 9.1 ± 6.9 pmol L 120 min), whereas the difference between MILK MINERALS versus CONTROL was small and non-significant (p = 0.098; mean difference: 4.2 ± 5.1 pmol L 120 min).When ingested alone, milk minerals rich in calcium do not increase GLP-1 secretion compared to calcium citrate.

We previously identified proto-oncogene -protein kinase Src (Src) as a crucial host determinant of ILTV infection. The present study revealed accelerated spread of ILTV upon Src inhibition. This phenomenon was independent of either viral replication or the proliferation of infected cells and could not be compromised by neutralizing antibody. Neither extracellular vesicles nor the direct cytosol-to-cytosol connections between adjacent cells contributed to the enhanced spread of ILTV upon Src inhibition. Further genome-wide transcriptional profile analyses in combination with functional validation identified fatty acid  as an essential molecular event during modulation of the intercellular spread and subsequent cytopathic effect of ILTV by Src. Overall, these data suggest that Src controls the cell-to-cell spread of ILTV in a cellular fatty acid -dependent manner, which determines the virus's cytopathic effect.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is manifested by a complete or partial inability to convert phenylalanine (Phe) to  and leads to increased concentrations of Phe in the blood and in other tissues, including the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage if left untreated. Low-phenylalanine diet is a key component of classical PKU therapy.The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of classical phenylketonuria therapy and compliance with doctors' recommendations in the first 5 years of life.Data was collected from all diagnosed and treated patients (n = 57) born 1999-2010. Phenylalanine blood levels, the number of visits to a specialist outpatients' center, the number of blood tests, as well as socioeconomic status (SES) and parents' education level have been analyzed, and potential relationships have been assessed.In the 1st year of life patients visited their doctors (odds ratio (OR) = 6.8267; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 2.827-16.5163; p < 0.0001) and had their blood collected (OR = 2.7875; 95% CI = 1.0467-7.4234; p < 0.0402) significantly more frequently than in the 2nd year. This tendency persisted into subsequent years. Similarly, in infancy they had statistically significantly lower odds of exceeding more than 40% of their Phe levels over therapeutic range than 1 year later (OR = 3.6078; 95% CI = 1.4859-8.7599; p < 0.0046). No PKU child had more than 70% of Phe levels over the therapeutic range in the 1st year of life, whereas 4 years later there were 18 such children. Phe levels were correlated with the number of visits to a specialist (ρ = 0.39) and the number of Phe blood tests with index of dietary control (ρ = -0.33). The effectiveness of therapy and compliance with the doctor's recommendations seem to depend neither on the level of education of the patient's parents nor on their SES.Therapy effectiveness and patients' compliance in PKU is very good in infancy. However, both deteriorate in subsequent years. Moreover, they do not seem to depend on the family background.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557079>RASH WITH USE OF  KINASE INHIBITORS.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657228>Nitric Oxide-Dependent Protein Posttranslational Modifications Impair Mitochondrial Function and  to Contribute to Neurodegenerative Diseases.</a></h2><p>Most brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases manifest mitochondrial dysfunction as well as elevated production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), contributing to synapse loss and neuronal injury.

However, EGFR-TKIs clinical outcomes vary from person to person and these inter-individual differences may be due to genetic factors such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPs in genes involved in EGFR-TKIs pharmacodynamics,  and mechanism of action have been demonstrated to be associated with response, survival and toxicity in advanced NSCLC patients treated with EGFR-TKIs. Here we review the influence of gene polymorphisms in the EGFR pathway on clinical outcome and toxicity to EGFR-TKIs in advanced NSCLC patients. The EGFR-216 polymorphism has reported a strong association between response and/or survival to EGFR-TKIs in Caucasian population. Similarly, the effect of EGFR-CA repeats polymorphisms on survival of advanced NSCLC patients treated with EGFR-TKIs have been confirmed both in Caucasian and Asian population. The influence on toxicity of the -216, -191, CA repeats, Arg497Lys and Asp994Asp polymorphisms in EGFR have also been confirmed. Polymorphisms in AKT (rs1130214 and rs1130233) and SMAD3 (rs6494633, rs11071938 and rs11632964) have been associated with survival in advanced NSCLC patients treated with EGFR-TKIs. However, data come from a limited number of studies and need to be confirmed.

Microbial production of 2PE by phenylalanine bioconversion or de novo biosynthesis from sugar offer sustainable, reliable and natural production processes compared to chemical synthesis. Despite the ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to naturally synthesize 2PE, de novo synthesis in high concentration and yield remains a  engineering challenge. Here, we demonstrate that improving phosphoenolpyruvate supply by expressing pyruvate kinase variants and eliminating the formation of p-hydroxy-phenylethanol without creating  auxotrophy significantly contributed to improve 2PE production in S. cerevisiae. In combination with the engineering of the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and Ehrlich pathway, these mutations enabled better connection between glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway optimizing carbon flux towards 2PE. However, attempts to further connect these two parts of central carbon  by redirecting fructose-6P towards erythrose-4P by expressing a phosphoketolase-phosphotransacetylase pathway did not result in improved performance.

Given that DHA  by cytochrome P450 and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzymes affects retinal angiogenesis and vascular stability, we investigated the role of sEH in a mouse model of ROP. In WT mice, hyperoxia elicited  nitration and inhibition of sEH and decreased generation of the DHA-derived diol 19,20-dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid (DHDP). Correspondingly, in a murine model of ROP, sEH-/- mice developed a larger central avascular zone and peripheral pathological vascular tuft formation than did their WT littermates. Astrocytes were the cells most affected by sEH deletion, and hyperoxia increased astrocyte apoptosis. In rescue experiments, 19,20-DHDP prevented astrocyte loss by targeting the mitochondrial membrane to prevent the hyperoxia-induced dissociation of presenilin-1 and presenilin-1-associated protein to attenuate poly ADP-ribose polymerase activation and mitochondrial DNA damage. Therapeutic intravitreal administration of 19,20-DHDP not only suppressed astrocyte loss but also reduced pathological vascular tuft formation in sEH-/- mice. Our data indicate that sEH activity is required for mitochondrial integrity and retinal astrocyte survival in ROP. Moreover, 19,20-DHDP may be more effective than DHA as a nutritional supplement for preventing retinopathy in preterm infants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410530>Fenofibrate increases very-long-chain sphingolipids and improves blood glucose homeostasis in NOD mice.</a></h2><p>Sphingolipid  regulates beta cell biology and inflammation and is abnormal at the onset of type 1 diabetes. Fenofibrate, a regulator of sphingolipid , is known to prevent diabetes in NOD mice. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of fenofibrate on the pancreatic lipidome, pancreas morphology, pancreatic sympathetic nerves and blood glucose homeostasis in NOD mice.We treated female NOD mice with fenofibrate from 3 weeks of age. The pancreatic lipidome was analysed using MS. Analysis of pancreas and islet volume was performed by stereology. Islet sympathetic nerve fibre volume was evaluated using  hydroxylase staining. The effect on blood glucose homeostasis was assessed by measuring non-fasting blood glucose from age 12 to 30 weeks. Furthermore, we measured glucose tolerance, fasting insulin and glucagon levels, and insulin tolerance.We found that fenofibrate selectively increases the amount of very-long-chain sphingolipids in the pancreas of NOD mice. In addition, we found that fenofibrate causes a remodelling of the pancreatic lipidome with an increased amount of lysoglycerophospholipids. Fenofibrate did not affect islet or pancreas volume, but led to a higher volume of islet sympathetic nerve fibres and  hydroxylase-positive cells. Fenofibrate-treated NOD mice had a more stable blood glucose, which was associated with reduced non-fasting and increased fasting blood glucose. Furthermore, fenofibrate improved glucose tolerance, reduced fasting glucagon levels and prevented fasting hyperinsulinaemia.These data indicate that fenofibrate alters the pancreatic lipidome to a more anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic state. The beneficial effects on islet sympathetic nerve fibres and blood glucose homeostasis indicate that fenofibrate could be used as a therapeutic approach to improve blood glucose homeostasis and prevent diabetes-associated pathologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518391>Glucosylceramide synthase silencing combined with the receptor  kinase inhibitor axitinib as a new multimodal strategy for glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>A great deal of evidence has been accumulated revealing that lipid  is drastically altered during tumorigenesis. In this work, glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) was targeted, using RNA interference technology (siRNAs), in U87 and DBTRG human glioblastoma (GBM) cells, as in both cell types GCS showed to be overexpressed with respect to normal human astrocytes. The efficacy of a combined therapy to tackle GBM, allying GCS silencing to the new generation chemotherapeutics sunitinib and axitinib, or to the alkylating drugs etoposide and temozolomide, is evaluated here for the first time. With this purpose, studies addressing GBM cell viability and proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were performed, which revealed that combination of GCS silencing with axitinib treatment represents a promising therapeutic approach. The reduction of cell viability induced by this combined therapy is proposed to be mediated by excessive production of reactive oxygen species. This work, identifying GCS as a key molecular target to increase GBM susceptibility to a new generation chemotherapeutic, opens windows to the development of innovative strategies to halt GBM recurrence after surgical resection.© The Author(s) 2019.

Genomic amplifications, activating mutations, and overexpression of receptor  kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR, and genes in core RTK signaling transduction  such as PI3K are common in GBM. However, efforts to target these  have been largely unsuccessful in the clinic, and the median survival of GBM patients remains poor at 14-15 months. Therefore, to improve patient outcomes, there must be a concerted effort to elucidate the underlying biology involved in GBM tumorigenesis. Drosophila melanogaster has been a highly effective model for furthering our understanding of GBM tumorigenesis due to a number of experimental advantages it has over traditional mouse models. For example, there exists extensive cellular and genetic homology between humans and Drosophila, and 75% of genes associated with human disease have functional fly orthologs. To take advantage of these traits, we developed a Drosophila GBM model with constitutively active variants of EGFR and PI3K that effectively recapitulated key aspects of GBM disease. Researchers have utilized this model in forward genetic screens and have expanded on its functionality to make a number of important discoveries regarding requirements for key components in GBM tumorigenesis, including genes and  involved in extracellular matrix signaling, glycolytic , invasion/migration, stem cell fate and differentiation, and asymmetric cell division. Drosophila will continue to reveal novel biological  and mechanisms involved in gliomagenesis, and this knowledge may contribute to the development of effective treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410531>Adenine nucleotide-mediated regulation of hepatic PTP1B activity in mouse models of type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Plasma 5'-AMP (pAMP) is elevated in mouse models of type 2 diabetes. However, the  regulatory role of adenine nucleotides in type 2 diabetes remains unclear.Adenine nucleotides and their metabolites in plasma and liver were examined by HPLC. H NMR-based metabolomics analysis was performed to explore the changes of metabolites in mouse models of type 2 diabetes. Na/K ATPase and Na/H exchanger activity were measured in response to adenine nucleotide metabolites. Human recombinant protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was used for enzyme kinetic assays. Protein binding assays were performed with microscale thermophoresis. The intracellular pH of hepatocyte AML12 cell lines was measured using the BCECF-AM method. We also analysed pAMP levels in participants with type 2 diabetes.Elevation of pAMP was a universal phenomenon in all mouse models of type 2 diabetes including db/db vs lean mice (13.9 ± 2.3 μmol/l vs 3.7 ± 0.9 μmol/l; p < 0.01), ob/ob vs lean mice (9.1 ± 2.0 μmol/l vs 3.9 ± 1.2 μmol/l; p < 0.01) and high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced vs wild-type mice (6.6 ± 1.5 μmol/l vs 4.1 ± 0.9 μmol/l; p < 0.05); this elevation was required for the occurrence of hyperglycaemia in obese mice. H NMR-based metabolomics study following HPLC analysis revealed that the metabolite profile in wild-type mice treated with 5'-AMP was similar to that in db/db diabetic mice, especially the accumulation of a large quantity of ATP and its metabolites. The glucose-lowering drug metformin reduced the severity of hyperglycaemia both in 5'-AMP-induced wild-type mice and db/db mice. Metformin decreased the accumulation of liver ATP but not its metabolites in these hyperglycaemic mice. ATP and metformin reciprocally change cellular pH homeostasis in liver, causing opposite shifts in liver activity of PTP1B, a key negative regulator of insulin signalling. Furthermore, pAMP levels were also elevated in individuals with type 2 diabetes (45.2 ± 22.7 nmol/l vs 3.1 ± 1.9 nmol/l; p < 0.01).These results reveal an emerging role for adenine nucleotide in the regulation of hyperglycaemia and provide a potential therapeutic target in obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492693>Interindividual Variation in CYP3A Activity Influences Lapatinib Bioactivation.</a></h2><p>Lapatinib is a dual  kinase inhibitor associated with rare but potentially severe idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. We have previously shown that cytochromes P450 CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 quantitatively contribute to lapatinib bioactivation, leading to formation of a reactive, potentially toxic quinone imine. CYP3A5 is highly polymorphic; however, the impact of CYP3A5 polymorphism on lapatinib  has not been fully established. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of  genotype and individual variation in CYP3A activity on the  activation of lapatinib using human-relevant in vitro systems. Lapatinib  was examined using -genotyped human liver microsomes and cryopreserved human hepatocytes. CYP3A and CYP3A5-selective activities were measured in liver tissues using probe substrates midazolam and T-5 (T-1032), respectively, to evaluate the correlation between enzymatic activity and lapatinib metabolite formation. Drug metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Further, the relative contributions of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 to lapatinib -debenzylation were estimated using selective chemical inhibitors of CYP3A. The results from this study demonstrated that lapatinib -debenzylation and quinone imine-GSH conjugate formation were highly correlated with hepatic CYP3A activity, as measured by midazolam 1'-hydroxylation. CYP3A4 played a dominant role in lapatinib bioactivation in all liver tissues evaluated. The CYP3A5 contribution to lapatinib bioactivation varied by individual donor and was dependent on CYP3A5 genotype and activity. CYP3A5 contributed approximately 20%-42% to lapatinib -debenzylation in livers from CYP3A5 expressers. These findings indicate that individual CYP3A activity, not  genotype alone, is a key determinant of lapatinib bioactivation and likely influences exposure to reactive metabolites. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study is the first to examine the effect of  genotype, total CYP3A activity, and CYP3A5-selective activity on lapatinib bioactivation in individual human liver tissues. The results of this investigation indicate that lapatinib bioactivation via oxidative -debenzylation is highly correlated with total hepatic CYP3A activity, and not  genotype alone. These findings provide insight into the individual factors, namely, CYP3A activity, that may affect individual exposure to reactive, potentially toxic metabolites of lapatinib.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532419>A selective colorimetric strategy for probing dopamine and levodopa through the mussel-inspired enhancement of FeO catalysis.</a></h2><p>Mussel-inspired enhancement of Fe3O4 catalysis was discovered towards a highly selective and sensitive colorimetric strategy for the magnetic separation-based evaluation of dopamine and/or levodopa in urine, in which the specific interaction of bis-catechol-containing analytes and mesoporous Fe3O4 NPs would form highly stable complexes of bis-catechol-Fe coordination.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301539>Boswellic extracts and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids prevent type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus by suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.</a></h2><p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease directed to the pancreatic islets where inflammation leads to the death of insulin-producing ß cells and insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes, which is closely related to overweight, is characterized by insulin resistance. In both cases, proinflammatory cytokines play an important role by causing insulitis and insulin resistance. The gum resin of Boswellia species and its pharmacologically active compounds, including 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids have been shown to suppress the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in various immune-competent cells.To review the present evidence of the therapeutic effects of boswellic extracts (BE) and/or 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids in the prevention/treatment of diabetes mellitus and to provide comprehensive insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms.This review considers all available informations from preclinical and clinical studies concerning BEs, 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids, proinflammatory cytokines and diabetes mellitus collected via electronic search (PubMed) and related publications of the author.Type 1 diabetes: Studies in mice with autoimmune diabetes revealed that in the model of multiple injections of low doses of streptozotocin (MLD-STZ), an extract of the gum resin of Boswellia serrata and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acid (KBA) suppressed the increase in proinflammatory cytokines in the blood, infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and increase in blood glucose. In a second model, i.e. the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, KBA prevented the infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets. Regarding the clinical effects, a case report provided evidence that BE suppressed the blood levels of  phosphatase antibody (IA-A), a marker for insulitis, in a patient with late-onset autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA). Type 2 diabetes: In a preclinical study in rats where obesity was alimentary induced, the administration of BE significantly reduced food intake, overweight, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and ameliorated the parameters of glucose and lipid . Similar results were obtained in a second animal study, where type 2 diabetes was induced by a combination of a high-fat/high-fructose diet and a single dose of streptozotocin. Two clinical trials with patients with type 2 diabetes receiving the resin of Boswellia serrata demonstrated improvement in the blood glucose, HbA and lipid parameters.Preclinical and clinical data suggest that BE and/or 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines from immune-competent cells, may prevent insulitis and insulin resistance in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, and therefore may be an option in the treatment/prevention of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is hypothesized that molecularly, BE and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids act via interference with the IκB kinase/Nuclear Transcription Factor-κB (IKK/NF-κB) signaling pathway through inhibition of the phosphorylation activity of IKK. However, further investigations and well-designed clinical studies are required.Copyright © 2019 The Author. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

We evaluated the prognostic value of changes in serum amino acid concentrations in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) METHODS: Seventy-five PBC patients who started urusodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy were retrospectively enrolled. Baseline serum concentrations of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and , and BCAA-to- ratio (BTR) were determined. The hazard ratios (HRs) of factors associated with liver-related events were analyzed by Cox proportional hazard analysis.Of the 75 patients enrolled, 12 showed a decrease in serum BCAA levels and 15 showed an increase in serum  levels. The BTR decreased in 16 patients. During a median 5.6-year follow-up, liver-related events occurred in 11 patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that high serum  levels at baseline and high alkaline phosphatase levels 48 weeks after starting UDCA therapy were independent risk factors for event occurrence. From the receiver operator characteristics curve analysis, serum  concentration >110 μmol/L was identified as a cutoff value with an adjusted HR 20.9 (95% confidence interval: 4.3-101.5, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the 5-year cumulative incidences of event occurrence in patients with high and low serum  concentration were 56.5% and 5.5%, respectively (P < 0.001). The 10-year survival probabilities also showed significant differences between patients with high and low serum  concentration (44.9% vs. 92.0%, P < 0.001).Elevation of serum  concentration indicates high risk of liver-related events in PBC patients under UDCA therapy.This article is protected by copyright.

We conducted a retrospective observational multicentric study in Spanish HT1 patients treated with NTBC to assess clinical and biochemical long-term evolution.We evaluated 52 patients, 7 adults and 45 children, treated with NTBC considering: age at diagnosis, diagnosis by clinical symptoms, or by newborn screening (NBS); phenotype (acute/subacute/chronic), mutational analysis; symptoms at diagnosis and clinical course; biochemical markers; doses of NTBC; treatment adherence; anthropometric evolution; and neurocognitive outcome.The average follow-up period was 6.1 ± 4.9 and 10.6 ± 5.4 years in patients with early and late diagnosis respectively. All patients received NTBC from diagnosis with an average dose of 0.82 mg/kg/d. All NBS-patients (n = 8) were asymptomatic at diagnosis except 1 case with acute liver failure, and all remain free of liver and renal disease in follow-up. Liver and renal affectation was markedly more frequent at diagnosis in patients with late diagnosis (P < .001 and .03, respectively), with ulterior positive hepatic and renal course in 86.4% and 93.2% of no-NBS patients, although 1 patient with good  control developed hepatocarcinoma.Despite a satisfactory global nutritional evolution, 46.1% of patients showed overweight/obesity. Interestingly lower body mass index was observed in patients with good dietary adherence (20.40 ± 4.43 vs 24.30 ± 6.10; P = .08) and those with good pharmacological adherence (21.19 ± 4.68 vs 28.58 ± 213.79).intellectual quotient was ≥85 in all NBS- and 68.75% of late diagnosis cases evaluated, 15% of which need pedagogical support, and 6.8% (3/44) showed school failure.Among the 12 variants identified in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase gene, 1 of them novel (H63D), the most prevalent in Spanish population is c.554-1 G>T.After NTBC treatment a reduction in  and alpha-fetoprotein levels was observed in all the study groups, significant for alpha-fetoprotein in no NBS-group (P = .03), especially in subacute/chronic forms (P = .018).This series confirms that NTBC treatment had clearly improved the prognosis and quality of life of HT1 patients, but it also shows frequent cognitive dysfunctions and learning difficulties in medium-term follow-up, and, in a novel way, a high percentage of overweight/obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298534> Induced Metabolome Alterations of  and Quantitation of Secondary Key Metabolites in Blue-Mold Cheese.</a></h2><p>To map qualitative and quantitative metabolome alterations when  is grown in an environment where  levels are perturbed, the recently established differential off-line LC-NMR (DOLC-NMR) approach was successfully applied in connection with an absolute metabolite quantitation using a quantitative H NMR protocol following the ERETIC 2 (Electronic REference To access In vivo Concentrations) methodology. Among the 23 influenced metabolites, amino acid degradation products like 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid and 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid underwent a tremendous upregulation in the amino acid perturbed approach.

The aim of this study was to perform an integrative epigenetic analysis of prostate adenocarcinoma to explore the epigenetic abnormalities involved in the development and progression of prostate adenocarcinoma. The key DNA methylation-driven genes were also identified.Methylation and RNA-seq data were downloaded for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Methylation and gene expression data from TCGA were incorporated and analyzed using MethylMix package. Methylation data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were assessed by R package limma to obtain differentially methylated genes. Pathway analysis was performed on genes identified by MethylMix criteria using ConsensusPathDB. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were also applied for the identification of  in which DNA methylation-driven genes significantly enriched. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module analysis in Cytoscape software were used to find the hub genes. Two methylation profile (GSE112047 and GSE76938) datasets were utilized to validate screened hub genes. Immunohistochemistry of these hub genes were evaluated by the Human Protein Atlas.A total of 553 samples in TCGA database, 32 samples in GSE112047 and 136 samples in GSE76938 were included in this study.

Deciphering the details of plasma metabolome in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients before and after primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PPCI) would allow for better understanding of the mechanisms involved during acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion in humans. We performed a detailed non-targeted metabolomic analysis of plasma from 27 STEMI patients who had undergone PPCI in the first 48 hrs employing a LC-MS approach. Plasma metabolome at ischemic condition was compared to multiple time points after PPCI which allowed us to focus on changes in the reperfusion phase. Classification of the differential metabolites based on chemical taxonomy identified a major role for lipids and lipid-derived molecules. Biochemical pathway analysis identified valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, vitamin B6  and glutathione  as the most significant   representing early response to I/R injury. We also identified phenyl alanine, , linoleic acid and glycerophospholipid  as the most significant  representing late response to I/R injury.

However, knowledge of these relationships is lacking in children, despite the growing public health problem posed by childhood obesity. The aim of this study was to assess whether plasma-free amino acid profiles can serve as useful biomarkers of lifestyle-related diseases in children with obesity.This retrospective study used the medical records of 26 patients (15 male, 11 female) aged 9 or 10 years presenting with moderate to severe obesity and hyperlipidemia between April 2015 and March 2017. A degree of obesity of 30% or more was defined as moderate or severe. Amino acid levels were compared between obese children with and without impaired glucose tolerance using a t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. In addition, the influence of factors such as intima media thickness, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, amino acids, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were analyzed pairwise using Pearson's correlation or Spearman's rank correlation.HOMA-IR was positively correlated with valine, leucine (Leu), isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, threonine, lysine, alanine, , glutamate (Glu), proline, arginine, ornithine, total free amino acids (all P < 0.01), and aspartate (P = 0.010). Moreover, blood uric acid levels were positively correlated with Leu (P = 0.005) and Glu (P = 0.019), and negatively correlated with serine, glycine, and asparagine (P = 0.007, P = 0.003, and P = 0.013, respectively).Amino acid profile reflects impaired glucose tolerance and hyperuricemia at an early stage of obesity.

We attempted to develop high-performance CPP immunoassays using high-affinity monoclonal antibodies prepared via cytokine-assisted immunization.  We used fetal liver  kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), CC subtype chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to assist traditional subcutaneous immunization of preparing high-affinity monoclonal antibodies, and further to develop high-performance immunoassay methods for CPP.  This novel immune strategy significantly enhanced immune response against CPP. Six anti-CPP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high affinity were successfully screened and selected for application in a fully automated magnetic chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). This robust and rapid assay can efficiently detect CPP in the range of 1.2-1250 pmol L with a detection limit of 6.25 pmol L. Significantly, the whole incubation process can be completed in 30 min as compared to about 4.5 hr for the control ELISA kit.

To date, many of them (around 70%) require warnings for liver injury and five of them, including pazopanib and sunitinib, have Black Box Warning (BBW) labels. Although TKI-induced hepatotoxicity is the first cause of drug failures in clinical trials, BBW labels, and market withdrawals, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. However, the recent discovery of new reactive metabolites (RM) with aldehyde structures during pazopanib and sunitinib  offers new perspectives for investigating their involvement in the toxicity of these two TKI. These hard electrophiles have a high reactivity potential toward proteins and are thought to be responsible for cytochrome P450 inactivation, drug-drug interactions (DDI), and liver toxicity. We report here, for the first time, the presence of these aldehyde RM in human plasma samples obtained during drug monitoring. Docking experiments in the CYP3A4 active site were performed and showed that pazopanib and sunitinib fitting in the catalytic site are in accordance with their regioselective oxidation to aldehydes. They also suggested that aldehyde RM may react with lysine and arginine residues. Based on these results, we studied the reactivity of the aldehyde RM toward lysine and arginine residues as potential targets on the protein framework to better understand how these RM could be involved in liver toxicity and drug-drug interactions. Adduct formation with different hepatic and plasma proteins was investigated by LC-MS/MS, and adducts between pazopanib or sunitinib aldehyde derivatives and lysine residues on both CYP3A4 and plasma proteins were indeed shown for the first time.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603552>Pathogenesis of Cluster Headache: From Episodic to Chronic Form, the Role of Neurotransmitters and Neuromodulators.</a></h2><p>To describe the role of biochemical anomalies of  (TYR), tryptophan (TRP), and arginine (ARG)  in patients suffering from episodic and chronic cluster headache (CCH).The pathogenesis of cluster headache (CH) and the process that transforms the episodic into the chronic form are unknown. However, the accompanying symptoms suggest a dysfunction of the sympathetic system and hypothalamus along with anomalies of  of catecholamines, elusive amines, and nitric oxide (NO) .We describe the results obtained from the last papers published on this issue. The level of metabolites were analyzed by different high-performance liquid chromatography methods.In both episodic and CH patients, the levels of dopamine and elusive amines are very elevated. The only biochemical difference found in studies between episodic and chronic cluster was that norepinephrine levels were significantly lower in episodic cluster in comparison to control and chronic subjects. In addition, the levels of ARG, homoarginine, and citrulline, precursors of synthesis of NO, were significantly lower in chronic cluster.All these results suggest that TYR, TRP, and ARG  is abnormal and may constitute a biochemical fingerprint of CH patients. The increased levels of norepinephrine in chronic cluster constitute a possible cause of chronicity of this primary headache. The high levels of tryptamine and its activity on the central serotoninergic system may explain why the length of CH is brief in comparison to migraine and tension-type headache. The low levels of ARG, homoarginine, and citrulline may be the consequence of high circulating levels of α -agonists, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, and their biochemical interaction with endothelial trace amine-associated receptor 1 that induces activation of NO synthase, resulting in NO synthesis in the circulation, NO release, intense vasodilation, and as a result, the cluster attack.© 2019 American Headache Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337616>Impaired Amino Acid and TCA  and Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy Progression in Type 1 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>While diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia, nutrient   like amino acid and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle are also profoundly perturbed.

Forty-seven participants with type 1 diabetes (60% female and mean ± SD age 35 ± 13 years, diabetes duration 13 ± 7 years, and HbA 7.9 ± 1.2%) had lower fumarate levels and higher threonine, serine, proline, asparagine, aspartic acid, phenylalanine, , and histidine levels compared with 10 age-matched healthy control subjects. Higher baseline fumarate levels and lower baseline amino acid levels-asparagine and glutamine-correlate with CAN (lower baseline SD of normal R-R interval [SDNN]). Baseline glutamine and ornithine levels also associated with the progression of CAN (lower SDNN at 3 years) and change in SDNN, respectively, after adjustment for baseline HbA, blood glucose, BMI, cholesterol, urine microalbumin-to- creatinine ratio, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and years of diabetes. Therefore, significant changes in the anaplerotic flux into the TCA cycle could be the critical defect underlying CAN progression.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679994>Plant Phenylalanine/ Ammonia-lyases.</a></h2><p>Aromatic amino acid deaminases are key enzymes mediating carbon flux from primary to secondary  in plants. Recent studies have uncovered a  ammonia-lyase that contributes to the typical characteristics of grass cell walls and contributes to about 50% of the total lignin synthesized by the plant. Grasses are currently preferred bioenergy feedstocks and lignin is the most important limiting factor in the conversion of plant biomass to liquid biofuels, as well as being an abundant renewable carbon source that can be industrially exploited. Further research on the structure, evolution, regulation, and biological function of functionally distinct ammonia-lyases has multiple implications for improving the economics of the agri-food and biofuel industries.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The roles of Wnt signaling in bone  have been extensively investigated. We previously attempted to clarify the roles of Wnt-non-canonical signaling in bone resorption and demonstrated that Wnt5a-receptor  kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2) signaling promoted osteoclast differentiation by enhancing RANK expression in osteoclast precursor cells. However, the roles of Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling in osteoclast function remain unclear.Trabecular bone mass was significantly greater in osteoclast-specific Ror2-deficient (Ror2) mice than in control mice due to the decreased bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts. Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling activated Rho in osteoclasts via dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis 2 (Daam2). The expression of protein kinase N3 (Pkn3), a Rho effector, increased during osteoclast differentiation. Trabecular bone mass was significantly greater in Pkn3-deficient mice than in wild-type mice due to the decreased bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts. Pkn3 bound to c-Src and Pyk2 in a Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling-dependent manner, thereby enhancing the kinase activity of c-Src in osteoclasts. The binding of Pkn3 to c-Src was essential for the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts.Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling promotes the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts by activating the Daam2-Rho-Pkn3-c-Src . Pkn3 inhibitors, therefore, have potential as therapeutic agents for osteoporosis and bone destruction in inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019 Japanese Association for Oral Biology.

For instance, chronic myeloid leukemia is now well treated with imatinib, a  kinase inhibitor. Around 80% of the patients reach complete remission. However, despite its great efficiency, some patients are resistant to the drug. This heterogeneity in the response might be associated with pharmacokinetic parameters, varying between individuals because of genetic variants. To assess this issue, next-generation sequencing of large panels of genes can be performed from patient samples. However, the common problem in pharmacogenetic studies is the availability of samples, often limited. In the end, large sequencing data are obtained from small sample sizes; therefore, classical statistical analyses cannot be applied to identify interesting targets. To overcome this concern, here, we described original and underused statistical methods to analyze large sequencing data from a restricted number of samples.To evaluate the relevance of our method, 48 genes involved in pharmacokinetics were sequenced by next-generation sequencing from 24 chronic myeloid leukemia patients, either sensitive or resistant to imatinib treatment. Using a graphical representation, from 708 identified polymorphisms, a reduced list of 115 candidates was obtained. Then, by analyzing each gene and the distribution of variant alleles, several candidates were highlighted such as UGT1A9, PTPN22, and ERCC5. These genes were already associated with the transport, the , and even the sensitivity to imatinib in previous studies.These relevant tests are great alternatives to inferential statistics not applicable to next-generation sequencing experiments performed on small sample sizes. These approaches permit to reduce the number of targets and find good candidates for further treatment sensitivity studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492392>A high protein meal affects plasma insulin concentrations and amino acid  in horses with equine  syndrome.</a></h2><p>Equine  syndrome (EMS) is characterized by an abnormal insulin response to a glycemic challenge but despite the known insulinotropic effects of certain amino acids, there is a paucity of data evaluating the impact of dietary protein on insulin dynamics in these horses. The objective was therefore to assess insulin and amino acid responses following intake of a high protein meal in healthy horses and those with EMS. Six mature horses diagnosed with EMS and six age-matched control horses without EMS were used. Horses were fed 2g/kg body mass (BM) of a high protein pellet (31% crude protein) at time 0 and 30min, for a total of 4g/kg BM, following an overnight fast. Blood samples collected during a 4h period were analysed for plasma glucose, insulin, amino acids and urea concentrations. Glucose concentrations were not different between groups (P=0.2). Horses with EMS had a 9-fold greater insulinemic response to the consumption of a high protein meal compared with controls (P=0.046). Post-prandial levels of histidine, citrulline, , valine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine and ornithine were higher in horses with EMS (P<0.05). Baseline urea nitrogen concentrations were not significantly different between groups (P=0.1). Knowing that certain amino acids are insulin secretagogues, these results illustrate that consumption of a high protein meal caused a hyperinsulinemic response and affected amino acid dynamics in horses with EMS. These findings suggest that dietary protein content should be taken into consideration in the management of horses with insulin dysregulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Intranasally administered insulin has already shown promise as a memory-enhancing therapy in patients with Alzheimer's and animal models of the disease. Intranasal drug delivery allows for direct targeting of insulin to the brain, bypassing the blood brain barrier and minimizing systemic adverse effects. In this study, we sought to expand upon previous results that show intranasal insulin may also have promise as a Parkinson's therapy. We treated 6-OHDA parkinsonian rats with a low dose (3 IU/day) of insulin and assessed apomorphine induced rotational turns, motor deficits via a horizontal ladder test, and dopaminergic cell survival via stereological counting. We found that insulin therapy substantially reduced motor dysfunction and dopaminergic cell death induced by unilateral injection of 6-OHDA. These results confirm insulin's efficacy within this model, and do so over a longer period after model induction which more closely resembles Parkinson's disease. This study also employed a lower dose than previous studies and utilizes a delivery device, which could lead to an easier transition into human clinical trials as a therapeutic for Parkinson's disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Sixteen lactating dairy cows with similar parity and days in milk were divided into high-yield (HY) and low-yield (LY) groups based on milk yield. On day 21, rumen fluid metabolites were quantified applying LC/MS. The principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares (OPLS-DA) showed significantly separated clusters of the ruminal metabolite profiles of HY and LY groups. Compared with HY group, a total of 24 ruminal metabolites were significantly greater in LY group, such as 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, carboxylic acids, carboxylic acid derivatives (L-isoleucine, L-valine, , etc.), diazines (uracil, thymine, cytosine), and palmitic acid, while the concentrations of 30 metabolites were dramatically decreased in LY group compared to HY group, included gentisic acid, caprylic acid, and myristic acid. The metabolite enrichment analysis indicated that protein digestion and absorption, ABC transporters and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis were significantly different between the two groups. Correlation analysis between the ruminal microbiome and metabolites revealed that certain typical metabolites were exceedingly associated with definite ruminal bacteria; Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Synergistetes phyla were highly correlated with most metabolites. These findings revealed that the ruminal metabolite profiles were significantly different between HY and LY groups, and these results may provide novel insights to evaluate biomarkers for a better feed digestion and may reveal the potential mechanism underlying the difference in milk yield in dairy cows.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400786>Age- and diet-specific effects of chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos on hormones, inflammation and gut microbiota in rats.</a></h2><p>Chlorpyrifos is a pesticide frequently detected in food and has been reported to disturb endocrine and gut health, which was regulated by gut microbiota and enteroendocrine cells. In this study, newly weaned (3 week) and adult (8 week) male rats fed a normal- or high- fat diet were chronically exposed to 0.3 mg chlorpyrifos/kg bodyweight/day. The effects of chlorpyrifos exposure on serum hormone levels, proinflammatory cytokines and gut microbiota were evaluated. Chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos significantly decreased the concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicule stimulating hormone and testosterone, which was found only in the normal-fat diet. The counteracted effect of high-fat diet was also found in gut hormones and proinflammatory cytokines. Significantly higher concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1, pancreatic polypeptide, peptide   (PYY), ghrelin, gastric inhibitory poly-peptide, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and TNF-α were found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, whereas only the PYY, ghrelin and IL-6 concentrations increased significantly in rats exposed in adulthood. Furthermore, a decrease in epinephrine induced by chlorpyrifos exposure was found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, regardless of their diet. Chlorpyrifos-induced disturbances in the microbiome community structure were more apparent in rats fed a high-fat diet and exposed beginning at newly weaned. The affected bacteria included short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (Romboutsia, Turicibacter, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, norank_f_Coriobacteriaceae, Faecalibaculum, Parasutterella and norank_f__Erysipelotrichaceae), testosterone-related genus (Turicibacter, Brevibacterium), pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus), and inflammation-related bacteria (unclassified_f__Ruminococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-009, Parasutterella, Oscillibacter), which regulated the endocrine system via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, as well as the immune response and gut barrier. Early exposure accelerated the endocrine-disturbing effect and immune responses of chlorpyrifos, although these effects can be eased or recovered by a high-fat diet.

It has been reported that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors promote the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), which is involved in the synthesis of serotonin. However, limited evidence of TPH alteration has been found in selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and more key enzymes need to be investigated. The aim of the present study was to determine whether venlafaxine (VLX; a classical SNRI) regulates TPH and other key enzymes responsible for the synthesis and  of monoaminergic transmitters in rats with chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). The present results suggested that CUS‑exposed rats exhibited decreased locomotor activity in the open‑field test and increased immobility time in the forced swim test, as compared with the controls. Pretreatment with VLX (20 mg/kg) significantly increased locomotor activity and reduced immobility time in the CUS‑exposed rats. In addition, VLX (20 mg/kg) treatment prevented the CUS‑induced reduction in  hydroxylase and TPH expression in the cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, VLX alleviated the CUS‑induced oxidative stress in the serum, cortex and hippocampus. However, VLX administration did not have an effect on indoleamine‑2,3‑dioxygenase overexpression in the hippocampus. It was therefore concluded that the regulation of abnormalities in the synthesis and  of monoaminergic transmitters may be associated with the antidepressant effects of VLX, suggesting that multimodal pharmacological treatments can efficiently treat depression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31398949>Taxonomic Distribution of Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenases (CYPs) among the Budding Yeasts (Sub-Phylum ).</a></h2><p>Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are ubiquitous throughout the tree of life and play diverse roles in  including the synthesis of secondary metabolites as well as the degradation of recalcitrant organic substrates.

There are currently five CYP families among budding yeasts with known function while at least another six CYP families with unknown function ("orphan CYPs") have been described. The current study surveyed the genomes of 372 species of budding yeasts for CYP-encoding genes in order to determine the taxonomic distribution of individual CYP families across the sub-phylum as well as to identify novel CYP families. Families CYP51 and CYP61 (represented by the ergosterol biosynthetic genes  and , respectively) were essentially ubiquitous among the budding yeasts while families CYP52 (alkane/fatty acid hydroxylases), CYP56 (-formyl- oxidase) displayed several instances of gene loss at the genus or family level.

This novel irreversible mutant-selective EGFR inhibitor targets EGFR containing both the resistance mutation (T790M) and the activating mutations (L858R and Del19), while it does not affect wild-type EGFR. However, the  pathway and bioactivation mechanisms of NZB are still unexplored. Thus, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we screened for products of NZB  formed  by human liver microsomal preparations and investigated the formation of reactive intermediates using potassium cyanide as a nucleophile trap. Unexpectedly, the azepane ring was not bioactivated. Instead, the carbon atom between the aliphatic linear tertiary amine and electron-withdrawing system (butenoyl amide group) was bioactivated, generating iminium intermediates as reactive species. Six NZB phase I metabolites, formed by hydroxylation, oxidation and -demethylation, were characterized. Moreover, two reactive iminium ions were characterized and their corresponding bioactivation mechanisms were proposed. Based on our results, we speculate that bioactivation of NZB can be blocked by small sterically hindering groups, isosteric replacement or a spacer. This approach might reduce the toxicity of NZB by avoiding the generation of reactive species.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539648>Insulin and adipokine signaling and their cross-regulation in postmortem human brain.</a></h2><p>Aberrant insulin and adipokine signaling has been implicated in cognitive decline associated with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative diseases. We established methods that reliably measure insulin, adiponectin and leptin signaling, and their crosstalk, in thawed postmortem mid-frontal cortical tissue from cognitively normal older subjects with a short postmortem interval. Insulin-evoked insulin receptor (IR) activation increases activated, -phosphorylated IRβ on  residues 960, 1150, and 1151, insulin receptor substrate-1 recruitment to IRβ and phosphorylated RAC-α-serine/threonine-protein kinase. Adiponectin augments, but leptin inhibits, insulin signaling. Adiponectin activates adiponectin receptors to induce APPL1 binding to adiponectin receptor 1 and 2 and T-cadherin and downstream adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation. Insulin inhibited adiponectin-induced signaling. In addition, leptin-induced leptin receptor (OB-R) signaling promotes Janus kinase 2 recruitment to OB-R and Janus kinase 2 and downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation. Insulin enhanced leptin signaling. These data demonstrate insulin and adipokine signaling interactions in human brain. Future studies can use these methods to examine insulin, adiponectin, and leptin  dysregulation in aging and disease states, such as type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the mechanisms by which cells with constitutive mTORC1 signaling maintain lysosomal catabolism remain to be elucidated. Using the murine epidermis as a model system, we found that epidermal Tsc1 deletion resulted in a phenotype characterized by wavy hair and curly whiskers, and was associated with increased EGFR and HER2 degradation. Unexpectedly, constitutive mTORC1 activation with Tsc1 loss increased lysosomal content via up-regulated expression and activity of MiT/TFEs, while genetic deletion of Rheb or Rptor or prolonged pharmacologic mTORC1 inactivation had the reverse effect. This paradoxical increase in lysosomal biogenesis by mTORC1 was mediated by feedback inhibition of AKT, and a resulting suppression of AKT-induced MiT/TFE down-regulation. Thus, inhibiting hyperactive AKT signaling in the context of mTORC1 loss-of-function fully restored MiT/TFE expression and activity. These data suggest that signaling feedback loops work to restrain or maintain cellular lysosomal content during chronically inhibited or constitutively active mTORC1 signaling respectively, and reveal a mechanism by which mTORC1 regulates upstream receptor  kinase signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302334>Cellular metabolomics reveals glutamate and pyrimidine  pathway alterations induced by BDE-47 in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells.</a></h2><p>Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) as potential neurotoxicants in environment may possess hazards to human health. Previous studies have reported that PBDEs exposure could induce oxidative stress and disturb mitochondrial functions in mammalian cells. However, the toxicological mechanism remains to be clarified. In this work, the neurotoxic effect and underlying mechanism of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) was investigated by using human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells as an effective model. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics approach combined with cell viability assay was applied to elucidate the  perturbations and relevant toxicological  upon BDE-47 exposure. Our results shown that the SK-N-SH cell viability decreased in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to BDE-47 at 24 h within the concentration range of 5-250 μM, and an IC value of 88.8 μM was obtained.

Although the detailed molecular mechanisms are still to be defined, our work shows for the first time that in primary B cells,  stressors enhance BTK signaling and suggest that  rewiring to hyperglycemia affects ibrutinib resistance in TP53 deficient chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lymphocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401089>Unlike reactivity of mono- and binuclear imine-copper(II) complexes toward melanoma cells via a tyrosinase-dependent mechanism.</a></h2><p>The cytotoxicity of a dinuclear imine-copper (II) complex 2, and its analogous mononuclear complex 1, toward different melanoma cells, particularly human SKMEL-05 and SKMEL-147, was investigated. Complex 2, a tyrosinase mimic, showed much higher activity in comparison to complex 1, and its reactivity was verified to be remarkably activated by UVB-light, while the mononuclear compound showed a small or negligible effect. Further, a significant dependence on the melanin content in the tumor cells, both from intrinsic pigmentation or stimulated by irradiation, was observed in the case of complex 2. Similar tests with keratinocytes and melanocytes indicated a much lower sensitivity to both copper (II) complexes, even after exposition to UV light. Clonogenic assays attested that the fractions of melanoma cells survival were much lower under treatment with complex 2 compared to complex 1, both with or without previous irradiation of the cells. The process also involves generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as verified by EPR spectroscopy, and by using fluorescence indicators. Autophagic assays indicated a remarkable formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles in melanomas treated with complex 2, while this effect was not observed in similar treatment with complex 1. Monitoring of specific protein LC3 corroborated the simultaneous occurrence of autophagy. A balance interplay between different modes of cell death, apoptosis and autophagy, occurs when melanomas were treated with the dinuclear complex 2, in contrast to the mononuclear complex 1. These results pointed out to different mechanisms of action of such complexes, depending on its nuclearity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

After fluoxetine treatment (10 mg/kg) for 14 days, urine samples were collected and behavior tests were applied. Tryptophan (TRP) metabolites and neurotransmitters in PFC were determined by prominence ultrafast liquid chromatography-QTRAP-mass spectrometry, and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) were evaluated by western blot. Urinary metabolites were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabonomics strategy.OBX rats showed hyperlocomotion in open field, hyperactivity in open arm and despair status, and fluoxetine reserved these behavioral abnormalities. The levels of TRP, 5-HIAA, 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio and DA increased, while kynurenine and 5-HT decreased in PFC of OBX rats. The activities of TPH2 and IDO1were inhibited after OBX. Twenty-six altered metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers in OBX rats involved in tryptophan , gut microbiota , energy , purine , ascorbate and aldarate , and  . Among them, 15 abnormal metabolites were corrected by fluoxetine to some extent.Our results revealed that urinary  profile changed greatly in OBX rats, and identified biomarkers might be helpful for the diagnosis of agitated depression. The regulation effects of fluoxetine on urinary  profile and tryptophan metabolites in PFC might contribute to its antidepressant action in OBX rats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TRP is involved in inappropriate social interactions, such as feather-destructive pecking behavior (FP) in birds selected for egg laying. Therefore, our goal was to determine the effect of social disruption stress on FP and the  of the amino acids TRP, phenylalanine (PHE),  (TYR), their relevant ratios, and on large neutral amino acids which are competitors with regard to their transport across the blood-brain barriers, at least in the human system, in adolescent birds selected for and against FP behavior. We used 160 laying hens selected for high (HFP) or low (LFP) FP activity and an unselected control line (UC). Ten pens with 16 individuals each (4 HFP birds; 3 LFP birds; 9 UC birds) were used. At 16 weeks of age, we disrupted the groups twice in 5 pens by mixing individuals with unfamiliar birds to induce social stress. Blood plasma was collected before and after social disruption treatments, to measure amino acid concentrations. Birds FP behavior was recorded before and after social disruption treatments. HFP birds performed significantly more FP and had lower KYN/TRP ratios. We detected significantly higher FP activity and significantly lower plasma PHE/TYR ratios and a trend to lower KYN/TRP ratios in socially disrupted compared to control pens. This might indicate that activating insults for TRP catabolism along the KYN axis in laying hens differs compared to humans and points toward the need for a more detailed analysis of regulatory mechanisms to understand the role of TRP  for laying hen immune system and brain function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639596>Targeted amino acid and related amines analysis based on iTRAQ®-LC-MS/MS for discovering potential hepatotoxicity biomarkers.</a></h2><p>Drug induced liver injury (DILI) is a diverse set of liver injury occurring after exposure to any manufactured or naturally occurring chemical compounds. DILI has already become the leading cause of acute liver failure in developed countries. Early diagnosis is of great significance for the prevention and treatment of DILI, which can effectively avoid its progress to acute liver failure. In this paper, a novel targeted metabolomics method based on isobaric tagging reagent iTRAQ®-LC-MS/MS was developed for the exploring of 42 common amino acids and related amines alterations in rats treated with hydrazine, aiming to discover the potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of DILI. Forty-two amino acids and related amines were covered in this new method. Through derivatization by iTRAQ reagent, all derivatized amino acids and related amines can be separated and quantified in 16 min with excellent peak shape and good separation efficiency. Fragments related to reporter group (m/z 113 or 121) of iTRAQ reagents could be generated from all derivatized amino acids and related amines under general multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) parameters. Isotope dilution method was established for the quantification of amino acid, which significantly reduced the interference of matrix effect on quantitative accuracy. Using this iTRAQ®-LC-MS/MS method, the changes of amino acid  were comprehensively investigated in rat serum and urine samples after DILI modeling by hydrazine. More significant changes of amino acids were observed in serum and urine samples with fold changes ranging from 0.5 to 193.7. Six significantly increased amino acids in serum, including L-citrulline, L-α-amino-adipic acid, , L-glutamic acid, glycine and L-lysine, and ten amino acids and related amines in urine including L-citrulline, L-α-amino-adipic acid, , taurine, β-alanine, ethanolamine, argininosuccinic acid, D,L-β-amino-isobutyric acid, γ-amino-n-butyric acid and L-glutamine, 3 of which were detected in both serum and urine. Except for L-lysine all these significantly increased amino acids and related amines possessed 92.5% to 100% specificity and sensitivity calculated at best cut-off points of their ROC curves in distinguishing control and DILI model group.Copyright © 2019.

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a  kinase receptor that belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily, and is normally expressed in neural cells, but has been detected in several malignancies. There is conflicting data in the literature that describes the expression of these receptors in breast cancer, and the aim of this study is to test the expression of CD30 and ALK in a cohort of Middle Eastern patients with breast carcinoma.Cases of invasive breast cancer from the archives of AUBMC were reviewed over a period of 9 years, and the blocks that were used for immunohistochemical staining for ER, PR, Her-2/neu were selected. Immunohistochemical staining for CD30 (JCM182) and ALK (5A4 and D5F3) was performed.Two hundred eighty-four cases were identified (2 cases were male), with a mean age of 55 ± 12. CD30 and ALK expression was not seen in any of the cases.Our cohort showed complete negativity to both CD30 and ALK, adding to the conflicting data available in the literature, and more studies are needed to reliably identify a trend of expression of CD30 and ALK in breast carcinoma, especially in the Middle East.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31338091>mTORC2 Deficiency Alters the  Profile of Conventional Dendritic Cells.</a></h2><p>In myeloid dendritic cells (DC), deletion of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) results in an augmented pro-inflammatory phenotype and T cell stimulatory activity; however, the underlying mechanism has not been resolved. Here, we demonstrate that mouse bone marrow-derived TORC2-deficient myeloid DC (TORC2 DC) utilize an altered  program, characterized by enhanced baseline glycolytic function compared to wild-type WT control (Ctrl) DC, increased dependence on glycolytic ATP production, elevated lipid content and higher viability following stimulation with LPS. In addition, TORC2 DC display an increased spare respiratory capacity (SRC) compared to WT Ctrl DC; this  phenotype corresponds with increased mitochondrial mass and mean mitochondrial DNA copy number, and failure of TORC2 DC mitochondria to depolarize following LPS stimulation. Our data suggest that the enhanced  activity of TORC2 DC may be due to compensatory TORC1 pathway activity, namely increased expression of multiple genes upstream of Akt/TORC1 activity, including the integrin alpha IIb, protein  kinase 2/focal adhesion kinase, IL-7R and Janus kinase 1(JAK1), and the activation of downstream targets of TORC1, including p70S6K, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and CD36 (fatty acid translocase). These enhanced TORC1 pathway activities may culminate in increased expression of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparγ) that regulates fatty acid storage, and the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1). Taken together, our data suggest that TORC2 may function to restrain TORC1-driven  activity and mitochondrial regulation in myeloid DC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493673>Crosstalk among polyamines, phytohormones, hydrogen peroxide, and phenylethanoid glycosides responses in Scrophularia striata to Cd stress.</a></h2><p>Plants respond to Cadmium (Cd) as a hazardous heavy metal through various mechanisms depending on their available metabolite resources. In this research, the physiological and signaling  mediating the responses to Cd stress in Scrophularia striata seedlings were characterized after they were exposed to different Cd concentrations at different time periods. The results showed that the polyamines (PAs), Abscisic acid (ABA) and hydrogen peroxide (HO) contents were significantly enhanced at 48 h. Moreover, the enzyme activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and  ammonia-lyase (TAL) as regulator enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway was increased, related to the reinforcement of phenolic compounds such as phenylethanoid glycosides (as a special compound of this plant). This  profiling indicates that the signal transduction of Cd stress increased the activity of different enzymes (PAL and TAL) by regulating the PAs , the modulation of ABA, and the HO content. As a result, it caused the accumulation of phenolic compounds, especially echinacoside and acteoside, both of which are required to improve the response of Cd stress in S. striata.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the relationship between the DDX family and cancer has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we identified a candidate oncogene DDX56 on Ch.7p by a bioinformatics approach using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of colorectal cancer (CRC). DDX56 expression was measured by RT-qPCR and immunochemical staining in 108 CRC patients. Clinicopathological and survival analyses were carried out using three CRC datasets. Biological roles of DDX56 were explored by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, cell cycle assays, and using DDX56-knockdown or overexpressed CRC cells. RNA sequencing was carried out to elucidate the effect of DDX56 on mRNA splicing. We found that DDX56 expression was positively correlated with the amplification of DDX56 and was upregulated in CRC cells. High DDX56 expression was associated with lymphatic invasion and distant metastasis and was an independent poor prognostic factor. In vitro analysis, in vivo analysis and GSEA showed that DDX56 promoted proliferation ability through regulating the cell cycle. DDX56 knockdown reduced intron retention and tumor suppressor WEE1 expression, which functions as a G2-M DNA damage checkpoint. We have identified DDX56 as a novel oncogene and prognostic biomarker of CRC that promotes alternative splicing of WEE1.© 2019 The Authors.

Metabolomic signatures represent the pathophysiological phenotype of diseases. Recent studies in gut microbiota and metabolomics analysis revealed the dramatic role of microbiome in psychoneurological system diseases, but still, the mechanisms underlying gut microbiome-host interaction remain unclear.Male Wistar rats were s.c. injection of ACTH fragment 1-24 for 14 days to induce treatment-resistant depression. Depression-related behavioral tests, analysis of serum monoamine neurotransmitters and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-related hormones were determined for assessment of ACTH-induced depression rat model. A gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometer based urinary metabolomic signatures integrated 16S rRNA sequence analysis based gut microbial profiling was performed, as well as Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis was used to manifest the covariation between the differential urinary metabolites and gut microbiota of genus level.Chronic injection of ACTH-induced depression-like phenotype (increased immobility time in forced swimming test and tail suspension test) was accompanied by peripheral serotonin down-regulation and HPA axis overactivation (ACTH and corticosterone up-regulation). Urinary metabolomics analysis indicated that pyruvic acid, L-threonine, mannitol, D-gluconic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, D-arabitol, myo-inositol and ascorbic acid levels were reduced in ACTH-treated rats' urine, while hippurate level was elevated. In addition, microbial community profiling revealed bacterial enrichment (e.g. Ruminococcus, Klebsiella) and reduction (e.g. Akkermansia, Lactobacillus) in the ACTH-induced depression rat model. Correlation analysis showed that Akkermansia and Lactobacillus were closely relevant to metabolites myo-inositol and hippurate, which were included in host inositol phosphate , and phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis.Depression rat model induced by ACTH is associated with disturbance of pyruvate , ascorbate and aldarate , inositol phosphate , glycine, serine and threonine , and glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, as well as changes in microbial community structure. Gut microbiota may participate in the mediation of systemic metabolomic changes in ACTH-induced depression model. Therefore, integrated metabolomic signatures and gut microbial community profiling would provide a basis for further studies on the pathogenesis of depression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594068>[Newborn screening program and blood amino acid profiling in early neonates with citrin deficiency].</a></h2><p> To investigate the profiles of blood amino acid and acylcarnitine in early neonates with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD) and the sensitivity of newborn screening, and to explore potential biochemical  markers for newborn screening program.  Amino acid and acylcarnitine profiles in dried blood spots of newborn screening program were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A total of 158 651 neonates born in Guangzhou from January 1, 2015 to June 30, 2019 were enrolled in this newborn screening program, and additionally 55 patients with NICCD confirmed by SLC25A13 gene analysis in Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center were included in this study. NICCD screen-positive was defined as the cutoff value of citrulline (Cit) ≥ 30 μmol/L. The values of blood sampling time of the true positive group and those of the false negative group were compared by -test. The levels of amino acid and acylcarnitine among different groups, including true positive group (Cit≥30 μmol/L), false negative group (Cit 21-30 μmol/L and Cit21 μmol/L) and the normal control group, were analyzed by  test, respectively.  Among 158 651 neonates, 39 neonates were positive for NICCD screening. Three of them were confirmed NICCD and 4 cases were found to be false negatives. The positive predictive value was 7.7% and the sensitivity was about 43.0%. Among 55 patients with NICCD, 18 cases (18/55, 32.7%) were true positives and 37 cases (37/55, 67.3%) were false negatives based on the cutoff value of citrulline in the dried blood spots for newborn screening. The blood sampling time was significantly different between true positive group and false negative group ((4.28±1.6)  (2.98±0.74) d, 4.06, 0.01). The increased levels of ((176.0±98.4) μmol/L), methionine ((37.0±26.9) μmol/L) and phenylalanine ((133.0±80.9)μmol/L) in Cit≥30 μmol/L group (18) were significantly different as compared with those in the other three groups, respectively (117.0, 58.5, 135.0, 0.01). The levels of arginine ( (10.0±9.2) , (11.0±9.3) , (9.0±17.8) μmol/L), valine ( (119.0±29.8) , (107.6±14.1) , (102±68) μmol/L) and leucine ( (167.0±37.1) , (161.0±37.7) , (163.5±180.6) μmol/L) were not statistically significant among groups of Cit≥30 μmol/L(18), Cit21-<30 μmol/L(7) and Cit21μmol/L(30,0.05), but they were significantly higher than those of the normal control group ((4±3), (78±21), (114.0±31.5) μmol/L, 1 000), respectively(30.1, 23.0, 29.8, 0.01). Alanine (Ala) ( (150±50) , (156.0±30.2), (168±105), (152±52) μmol/L) levels showed no significant difference (0.86, 0.05) but the ratios of Ala/Cit (1.52±1.44, 6.82±1.56, 12.06±7.71, 19.42±6.27) decreased significantly among the four groups (69.0, 0.05). The acylcarnitine levels showed no statistically significant results among the different groups (0.05). With Cit≥30 μmol/L and Ala/Cit7.5 as cutoff values, the number of screen-positive cases reduced from 39 to 22 cases with no additional false negative case. With Cit≥21 μmol/L and Ala/Cit7.5 as cutoff values the number of screen-positive cases increased to 117 cases with 1 additional true positive.  The profiles of blood amino acid in early neonates with NICCD present the increased levels of multiple amino acids including citrulline, , methionine and phenylalanine, and decreased ratio of Ala/Cit. Taking citrulline and ratio of Ala/Cit as screening markers can improve the positive predictive value appropriately. The limited sensitivity of NICCD newborn screening may be related to early blood sampling time.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451693>Liquid biopsy-based single-cell  phenotyping of lung cancer patients for informative diagnostics.</a></h2><p>Accurate prediction of chemo- or targeted therapy responses for patients with similar driver oncogenes through a simple and least-invasive assay represents an unmet need in the clinical diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.

Commonly, stress responses are detrimental to plant growth and, despite the fact that intensive efforts have been made to understand both plant development and defense separately, most of the molecular basis of this trade-off remains elusive. To cope with such a diverse range of processes, plants have developed several strategies including the precise balance of key plant growth and stress regulators [i.e. phytohormones, reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and reactive oxygen species (ROS)]. Among RNS, nitric oxide (NO) is a ubiquitous gasotransmitter involved in redox homeostasis that regulates specific checkpoints to control the switch between development and stress, mainly by post-translational protein modifications comprising S-nitrosation of cysteine residues and metals, and nitration of  residues. In this review, we have sought to compile those known NO molecular targets able to balance the crossroads between plant development and stress, with special emphasis on the , perception, and signaling of the phytohormones abscisic acid and salicylic acid during abiotic and biotic stress responses.© The Author(s) 2019.

The isolated protein exhibits anti-platelet aggregation activity. Animal experiments showed that it exhibited defibration, anticoagulation, and antithrombotic effects and contributes to improved blood rheology and antiplatelet aggregation. In vivo experiments demonstrated that it prolonged clotting time, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin time, fibrinogen time and reduced fibrinogen content of mice. Also, metalloproteinase SP inhibited carrageenan-induced tail thrombosis, ADP-induced acute pulmonary embolism, and ADP, Arachidonic acid (AA), or collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In vitro experiments showed that the protein cleaved the α, β, and γ chains of fibrinogen. Metabolomic analysis upon metalloproteinase SP treatment revealed that 14 metabolites, which are mainly involved in phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis, responded to metalloproteinase SP treatment.

Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related.  levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2 diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

However, the mechanism underlying these symptoms remains unclear. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the major neuroendocrine axis that regulates homeostasis in mammals, including glucose . Corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH), which is synthesized in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, plays an important role in the regulation of blood glucose levels via the HPA axis. Our previous studies have reported that PVN neurons express numerous dopamine receptors (DRs) and accept direct projections from the substantia nigra (SN). We hypothesize that damage to dopaminergic neurons in the SN might influence the blood glucose level through the HPA system. Rats with bilateral SN lesions induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (referred to as 6-OHDA rats) were used to investigate alterations in the levels of blood glucose, CRH, and factors related to the HPA axis and to explore possible mechanisms. Blood glucose levels were detected at different time points after the glucose solution was intraperitoneally administered. CRH and DRs in the PVN were evaluated by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the pituitary and plasma corticosterone (CORT) was evaluated by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The results showed that 6-OHDA rats exhibited significantly decreased  hydroxylase (TH) in the SN and decreased glucose tolerance at 6 weeks, but not at 4 weeks. In the PVN, dopamine receptor 2 (D2) was expressed on CRH-positive neurons, and D2-positive neurons were surrounded by TH-positive fibers. Additionally, the expression of CRH was upregulated, whereas the expression of D2 and TH were downregulated in 6-OHDA rats compared with control rats. In D2 knock-out mice, the significantly enhanced expression of CRH and reduced expression of D2 were detected in the PVN. Furthermore, RIA revealed increased ACTH in the pituitary and elevated CORT in the blood. In summary, the present study suggests that the dopaminergic neurons in the SN are involved in the regulation of body glucose  through CRH neurons that express D2 in the hypothalamic PVN. SN lesions decrease glucose tolerance mainly by downregulating D2 and upregulating CRH in the PVN through the HPA neuroendocrine system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411471>Alterations of the Brain Proteome and Gut Microbiota in d-Galactose-Induced Brain-Aging Mice with Krill Oil Supplementation.</a></h2><p>Brain aging is commonly associated with neurodegenerative disorders, but the ameliorative effect of krill oil and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. In this study, the components of krill oil were measured, and the antiaging effects of krill oil were investigated in mice with d-galactose (d-gal)-induced brain aging via proteomics and gut microbiota analysis. Krill oil treatment decreased the expression of truncated dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoproteins and proteins involved in the calcium signaling pathway. In addition, the concentrations of dopamine were increased in the serum ( < 0.05) and brain ( > 0.05) due to the enhanced expressions of -3-monooxygenase and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase. Moreover, krill oil alleviated gut microbiota dysbiosis, decreased the abundance of bacteria that consume the precursor , and increased the abundance of  spp. and short-chain fatty acid producers. This study revealed the beneficial effect of krill oil against d-gal-induced brain aging and clarified the underlying mechanism through proteomics and gut microbiota analysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539712>Bioanalysis of EGFRm inhibitor osimertinib, and its glutathione cycle- and desmethyl metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Osimertinib is a "third-generation'' oral, irreversible,  kinase inhibitor. It is used in the treatment of non-small cellular lung carcinoma and spares wild-type EGFR. Due to its reactive nature, osimertinib is, in addition to oxidative routes, metabolized through GSH coupling and subsequent further  of these conjugates. The extent of the non-oxidative  of osimertinib is unknown, and methods to quantify this  route have not been reported yet. To gain insight into this  route, a sensitive bioanalytical assay was developed for osimertinib, the active desmethyl metabolite AZ5104, and the thio-metabolites osimertinibs glutathione, cysteinylglycine, and cysteine conjugates was developed. The ease of synthesis of these metabolites was a key-part in the development of this assay. This was done through simple one-step synthesis and subsequent LC-purification. The compounds were characterized by NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Sample preparation was done by a simple protein crash with acetonitrile containing the stable isotopically labeled internal standards for osimertinib and the thio-metabolites, partial evaporation of solvents, and reconstitution in eluent, followed by UHPLC-MS/MS quantification. The assay was successfully validated in a 2-2000 nM calibration range for all compounds except the glutathione metabolite, where the LLOQ was set at 6 nM due to low accuracy at 2 nM. Limited stability was observed for osimertinib, AZ5104, and the glutathione metabolite. The clinical applicability of the assay was demonstrated in samples of patients treated with 80 mg osimertinib once daily, containing all investigated compounds at detectable and quantifiable levels.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The complex molecular underpinnings of how lipid overload and lipid metabolites lead to the deregulation of  processes are incompletely understood. We assessed hepatic post-translational alterations in response to treatment of cells with saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids and the consumption of a high-fat diet by mice. These data revealed widespread  phosphorylation changes affecting a large number of enzymes involved in  processes as well as canonical receptor-mediated signal transduction . Targeting two of the most prominently affected molecular features in our data, SRC-family kinase activity and elevated reactive oxygen species, significantly abrogated the effects of saturated fat exposure in vitro and high-fat diet in vivo.

We examined changes in  over the first 72 h post-burn using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR) spectroscopy and serum from a porcine model of severe burn injury. We sought to quantify the changes in  that occur over time in response to severe burn and smoke inhalation in this preliminary study. Fifteen pigs received 40% total body surface area (TBSA) burns with additional pine bark smoke inhalation. Arterial blood was drawn at baseline (pre-burn) and every 24 h until 72 h post-injury or death. The aqueous portion of each serum sample was analyzed using H-NMR spectroscopy and metabolite concentrations were used for principal component analysis (PCA). Thirty-eight metabolites were quantified in 39 samples. Of these, 31 showed significant concentration changes over time ( < 0.05). PCA revealed clustering of samples by time point on a 2D scores plot. The first 48 h post-burn were characterized by high concentrations of histamine, alanine, phenylalanine, and . Later timepoints were characterized by rising concentrations of 2-hydroxybutyrate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and isovalerate. No significant differences in  related to mortality were observed. Our work highlights the accumulation of organic acids resulting from fatty acid catabolism and oxidative stress. Further studies will be required to relate accumulation of the four organic carboxylates identified in this analysis to outcomes from burn injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31448672>PAQR3 suppresses the growth of non-small cell lung cancer cells via modulation of EGFR-mediated autophagy.</a></h2><p>Macroautophagy/autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular process that recycles and degrades intracellular components to sustain homeostasis in response to deficiency of nutrients or growth factors. PAQR3 is a newly discovered tumor suppressor that also regulates autophagy induced by nutrient starvation via AMPK and MTORC1 signaling . In this study, we investigated whether PAQR3 modulates EGFR-mediated autophagy and whether such regulation is associated with the tumor suppressive activity of PAQR3. PAQR3 is able to inhibit the  and  growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. PAQR3 potentiates autophagy induced by EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. Knockdown of PAQR3 abrogates erlotinib-mediated reduction of BECN1 interaction with autophagy inhibitory proteins RUBCN/Rubicon and BCL2. PAQR3 blocks the interaction of BECN1 with the activated form of EGFR and inhibits  phosphorylation of BECN1. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by knocking down ATG7 abrogates the tumor suppressive activity of PAQR3 in NSCLC cells. Collectively, these data indicate that PAQR3 suppresses tumor progression of NSCLC cells through modulating EGFR-regulated autophagy.  : AKT: thymoma viral proto-oncogene; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; ATG14: autophagy related 14; BCL2: B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2; BECN1: beclin 1; CCK-8: cell counting kit-8; CQ: chloroquine diphosphate; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EdU: 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; IgG: Immunoglobulin G; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1; MTT: thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide; NSCLC: Non-small cell lung cancer; MAP2K/MEK: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MAPK/ERK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; PAQR3: progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 3; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase; PIK3C3/VPS34: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3; PIK3R4/VPS15: phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 4; PRKAA/AMPK: protein kinase, AMP-activated alpha catalytic; RUBCN: rubicon autophagy regulator; RPS6: ribosomal protein S6; RAS: Ras proto-oncogene; RAF: Raf proto-oncogene; TKI:  kinase inhibitor; TUBA4A: tubulin alpha 4a; UVRAG: UV radiation resistance associated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644543>RNA-Seq analysis reveals an essential role of   pathway in response to root-rot infection in Gerbera hybrida.</a></h2><p>Gerbera hybrida is one of the top five cut flowers across the world, it is host for the root rot causing parasite called Phytophthora cryptogea. In this study, plantlets of healthy and root-rot pathogen-infected G. hybrida were used as plant materials for transcriptome analyis using high-throughput Illumina sequencing technique. A total 108,135 unigenes were generated with an average length of 727 nt and N50 equal to 1274 nt out of which 611 genes were identified as DEGs by DESeq analyses. Among DEGs, 228 genes were up-regulated and 383 were down-regulated. Through this annotated data and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), molecular interaction network, transcripts accompanying with  , phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, and plant hormone signal transduction  were thoroughly observed considering expression pattern.
