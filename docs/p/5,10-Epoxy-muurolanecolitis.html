Different medical perspectives.</a></h1><p>transition is important for a successful follow-up of adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objectives of the study were to establish the situation of transition in Spain and to identify needs, requirements and barriers to transition from pediatric and adult gastroenterologist perspectives.a structured survey for self-completion using the REDCap platform was distributed via the Spanish Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SEGHNP) and the Spanish Working Group on Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative  (GETECCU). The questionnaire contained closed and ranked questions concerning transition, perceived needs, organizational, clinician and patient related barriers to transition.one hundred and forty surveys were answered, 53% in pediatrics (PG) and 47% from adult gastroenterologists (AG) among 90 hospitals; 66% of them were reference centers. There was a higher response from pediatricians (18.2%) versus adult gastroenterologists (8.3%) (p = 0.03). A structured transition program is adequate in 42.2% centers. A well-structured transition was perceived as very important by 79.% of PG and 63% of AG (p = 0.03). A higher proportion of both groups identified inadequacies in the preparation of adolescents for transfer (43% and 38%, p = ns). The main deficit areas were the lack of knowledge about disease and treatment as well as the lack of self-advocacy and care coordination. Lack of resources, time and critical mass of patients were the highest ranked barriers by both groups. AG and PG (54% and 55%) highlighted suboptimal training in adolescent medicine.in Spain, nearly half of the centers have developed a structured transition program. Lack of training, time and insufficient resources are the main barriers for a successful transition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498502>Nationwide validation study of diagnostic algorithms for inflammatory bowel disease in Korean National Health Insurance Service database.</a></h1><p>We conducted a nationwide validation study of diagnostic algorithms to identify cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) within the Korea National Health Insurance System (NHIS) database.Using the NHIS dataset, we developed 44 algorithms combining the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes, codes for Rare and Intractable Diseases (RID) registration and claims data for health care encounters, and pharmaceutical prescriptions for IBD-specific drugs. For each algorithm, we compared the case identification results from electronic medical records data with the gold standard (chart-based diagnosis). A multiple sampling test verified the validation results from the entire study population.A random nationwide sample of 1697 patients (848 potential cases and 849 negative control cases) from 17 hospitals were included for validation. A combination of the ICD-10 code, ≥ 1 claims for health care encounters, and ≥ 1 prescription claims (reference algorithm) achieved excellent performance (sensitivity, 93.1% [95% confidence interval 91-94.7]; specificity, 98.1% [96.9-98.8]; positive predictive value, 97.% [96.1-98.]; negative predictive value, 94.% [92.8-95.8]) with the lowest error rate (4.2% [3.3-.3]). The multiple sampling test confirmed that the reference algorithm achieves the best performance regarding IBD diagnosis. Algorithms including the RID registration codes exhibited poorer performance compared with that of the reference algorithm, particularly for the diagnosis of patients affiliated with secondary hospitals. The performance of the reference algorithm showed no statistical difference depending on the hospital volume or IBD type, with P-value < 0.05.We strongly recommend the reference algorithm as a uniform standard operational definition for future studies using the NHIS database.© 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583863>Prescription of Antibiotics for Adults with Acute Infectious Diarrhea in Korea: A Population-based Study.</a></h1><p>Acute infectious diarrhea (AID) is a commonly observed condition globally. Several studies recommend against the use of empiric antibiotic therapy for AID, except in some cases of travelers' diarrhea. However, many physicians prescribe antimicrobial agents for AID. We aimed to determine the rate of antibiotic use and the associated prescription patterns among adults with AID.This population-based, retrospective epidemiological study was performed using Korean National Health Insurance claims data from 2016 to 2017. The study population comprised adults (age ≥18 years) who had visited clinics with AID-related complaints. Exclusion criteria were the presence of Crohn's disease, ulcerative , irritable bowel syndrome, and other non-infectious forms of . Patients who underwent surgery during admission were also excluded.The study population comprised 1,613,057 adult patients with AID (767,606 [47.6%] men). Young patients (age 18 - 39 years) accounted for 870,239 (54.0%) of the study population. Overall, 752,536 (46.7%) cases received antibiotic prescriptions. The rate of antibiotic administration tended to be higher among elderly patients (age ≥65 years) than among younger patients (49.% . 46.4%,  <0.001). The antibiotics most frequently prescribed in both monotherapy and combination regimens were fluoroquinolones (29.8%), rifaximin (26.8%), second-generation cephalosporins (9.2%), third-generation cephalosporins (7.3%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (.%), and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors (.3%). Patients who visited tertiary care hospitals had lower rates of antibiotic therapy (n = 14,131, 41.8%) than did those visiting private clinics (n = 532,951, 47.1%). In total, 56,275 (62.3%) admitted patients received antibiotic therapy, whereas outpatients had lower rates of antibiotic prescription (n = 694,204, 46.0%).This study revealed differences between the antibiotics used to treat AID in Korea and those recommended by the guidelines for AID treatment. Multifaceted efforts are necessary to strengthen physicians' adherence to published guidelines.Copyright © 2019 by The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases and Korean Society for Antimicrobial Therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614543>The Sulfate-Reducing Microbial Communities and Meta-Analysis of Their Occurrence during Diseases of Small-Large Intestine Axis.</a></h1><p>Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are often isolated from animals and people with ulcerative  and can be involved in the IBD development in the gut-intestine axis. The background of the research consisted of obtaining mixed cultures of SRB communities from healthy mice and mice with , finding variation in the distribution of their morphology, to determine pH and temperature range tolerance and their possible production of hydrogen sulfide in the small-large intestinal environment. The methods: Microscopic techniques, biochemical, microbiological, and biophysical methods, and statistical processing of the results were used. The results: Variation in the distribution of sulfate-reducing microbial communities were detected. Mixed cultures from mice with ulcerative  had 1.39 times higher production of HS in comparison with samples from healthy mice. The species of  genus play an important role in diseases of the small-large intestine axis. Meta-analysis was also used for the observation about an SRB occurrence in healthy and not healthy individuals and the same as their metabolic processes. Conclusions: This finding is important for its possible correlation with inflammation of the intestine, where the present of SRB in high concentration plays a major part. It can be a good possible indicator of the occurrence of IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645725>Structural basis of species-selective antagonist binding to the succinate receptor.</a></h1><p>The tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate succinate is involved in metabolic processes and plays a crucial role in the homeostasis of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. The receptor responsible for succinate signalling, SUCNR1 (also known as GPR91), is a member of the G-protein-coupled-receptor family and links succinate signalling to renin-induced hypertension, retinal angiogenesis and inflammation. Because SUCNR1 senses succinate as an immunological danger signal-which has relevance for diseases including ulcerative , liver fibrosis, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis-it is of interest as a therapeutic target. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of rat SUCNR1 in complex with an intracellular binding nanobody in the inactive conformation. Structure-based mutagenesis and radioligand-binding studies, in conjunction with molecular modelling, identified key residues for species-selective antagonist binding and enabled the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a humanized rat SUCNR1 in complex with a high-affinity, human-selective antagonist denoted NF-56-EJ40. We anticipate that these structural insights into the architecture of the succinate receptor and its antagonist selectivity will enable structure-based drug discovery and will further help to elucidate the function of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504528>Corticosteroid-Free Remission vs Overall Remission in Clinical Trials of Moderate-Severe Ulcerative  and Crohn's Disease.</a></h1><p>We summarized the protocol-specified corticosteroid tapering regimens in clinical trials of moderate-severe ulcerative  (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and calculated differences in rates of clinical remission vs corticosteroid-free clinical remission (CSF-CR).Through a systematic literature review through February 28, 2019, we identified 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of biologics or small molecules in patients with moderate-severe UC or CD who reported CSF-CR as an outcome. We estimated the relative risk and 95% confidence interval of achieving CSF-CR vs overall clinical remission in patients treated with active intervention or placebo through random-effects meta-analysis.Across trials of UC (11 trials) and CD ( trials), a median of 53% and 49% of participants were on corticosteroids at the time of trial entry, respectively. Participants were allowed to enter trials at a median corticosteroid dose (range) of 35 (20-40) mg/d. Doses were kept stable for a median (range) of 8 (-10) weeks during induction therapy, after which a mandatory and structured taper was implemented, albeit with the investigators' discretion depending on clinical status. Pooled rates of CSF-CR in patients with UC and CD treated with placebo were 9.7% and 19.1%, respectively. In UC and CD trials, the rate of CSF-CR was 24% and 18% lower than the rate of overall clinical remission, respectively.Protocol-specified corticosteroid tapering regimens vary across trials. These findings will help to inform the design and interpretation of future clinical trials and highlight the need for standardization.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

However, there is only limited clinical experience. We now present the first-in-patient treatment using (CRS/RA) for VT in Germany.A 78-year-old male patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and significantly reduced ejection fraction (15%) presented with monomorphic VT refractory to poly-anti-arrhythmic medication and causing multiple implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) interventions over the course of several weeks, necessitating prolonged treatment on an intensive care unit. Ultra-high-resolution electroanatomical voltage mapping (EVM) revealed a re-entry circuit in the cardiac septum inaccessible for catheter ablation. Based on the EVM, CRS/RA with a single session dose of 25 Gy (83% isodose) was delivered to the VT substrate (8.1 cc) using a c-arm-based high-precision linear accelerator on November 30, 2018.CRS/RA was performed without incident and dysfunction of the ICD was not observed. Following the procedure, a significant reduction in monomorphic VT from .0 to 1.6 episodes per week and of ICD shock interventions by 81.2% was observed. Besides periprocedural nausea with a single episode of vomiting, no treatment-associated side effects were noted. Unfortunately, the patient died 57 days after CRS/RA due to sepsis-associated cardiac circulatory failure after Clostridium difficile-associated  developed during rehabilitation. Histopathologic examination of the heart as part of a clinical autopsy revealed diffuse fibrosis on most sections of the heart without apparent differences between the target area and the posterior cardiac wall serving as a control.CRS/RA appears to be a possible treatment option for otherwise untreatable patients suffering from refractory VT and electrical storm. A relevant reduction in VT incidence and ICD interventions was observed, although long-term outcome and consequences of CRS/RA remain unclear. Clinical trials are strongly warranted and have been initiated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443677>Mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of ulcerative : a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental and clinical studies.</a></h1><p>To explore the promising use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for ulcerative  (UC).Studies reporting MSC treatment on UC were searched on five databases. Methodological quality was assessed based on the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias (RoB) tool and MINORS tool. Data analysis was conducted using Engauge Digitizer 10.8 and Stata 14.0.A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria including 8 animal (n = 132) and 7 human (n = 216) trials. In animal studies, mice treated with MSCs had significantly lower disease activity index (DAI) than that in the control group: the 1st day (standardized mean difference (SMD) - 0.753, p = 0.027), the 3rd day (SMD - 1.634, p = 0.000), the 5th day (SMD - 2.124, p = 0.000), the 7th day (SMD - .327, p = 0.000), the 9th day (SMD - 2.979, p = 0.000), and the 14th day (SMD - .032, p = 0.000). Lower histopathological score (HS) (SMD - .15, p < 0.05) and longer colon length (SMD 2.147, p = 0.001) in mice treated with MSCs were also indicated. The main outcome in clinical trials showed, compared with control group, healing rate of patients accompanied by MSC therapy elevated obviously: MSCs vs -aminosalicylic acids (-ASA) (RR = 2.317, p = 0.000) and MSCs + -ASA vs placebo + -ASA (RR = .118). The analytical data in 4 trials conducted with single-arm studies also demonstrated increased healing rate (0.787) after MSC treatment (p = 0.000).Our meta-analysis results supported that MSCs could be an underlying method of treating UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494649>MEFV Gene-Related Enterocolitis Account for Some Cases Diagnosed as Inflammatory Bowel Disease Unclassified.</a></h1><p>Familial mediterranean fever (FMF), an autoinflammatory disease, is characterized by periodic fever and serositis. An MEFV gene mutation has been identified as the cause of FMF. Recently, patients with MEFV gene mutations and chronic gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation mimicking inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been reported. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients with IBD unclassified (IBDU) with MEFV gene mutations.MEFV gene analysis was performed on 8 patients with IBDU among 710 patients with IBD who had been treated at Kyorin University Hospital from April 2016 to December 2018. Clinical manifestations, endoscopic findings, and serological markers were also analyzed.The average of the 8 patients with IBDU (3 men,  women) was 32.7 ± 6.4 years (range 26-76 years). Their symptoms comprised diarrhea (n = 8, 100%), hematochezia (n = 3, 37.%), abdominal pain (n = 3, 37.%), high fever (n = 2, 16.%), and other periodic symptoms (n = 2, 16.%). MEFV gene mutation was confirmed in 4/8 of these patients. Colonoscopy showed various mucosal lesions, rectal sparing, right side dominant , pseudopolyposis, and granular protrusions. Colchicine was administered to  of the 8 patients (4 with and 1 without MEFV mutation) who were resistant to conventional treatment for ulcerative . Clinical and endoscopic improvement was observed in all of  patients treated with colchicine.Some patients diagnosed as having IBDU have enterocolitis related to MEFV gene mutation and respond to colchicine therapy.© 2019 S.

Therefore, diagnostic markers for colorectal dysplasia and cancer are urgently needed for patients with UC. Stathmin 1 (STMN1) is a novel cancer biomarker that is also a novel target for treatment in several cancers, including colon cancer. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between STMN1 expression and clinical features in colorectal dysplasia and cancer in patients with UC. The present study examined the clinical significance of STMN1 expression in colorectal dysplasia and cancer with UC. The present study performed an immunohistochemical analysis of 31 clinical colorectal samples from eight patients with colorectal dysplasia and/or cancer to assess the relationships between STMN1 expression and clinicopathological features including mismatch repair protein expression, rate of Ki-67 positivity, differentiation level, TNM stage, and UC duration. STNM1 expression was detected in 95.7% of dysplastic and cancerous lesions, whereas p53, the current diagnostic marker, was not expressed in 39.1% of dysplastic and cancerous lesions. Furthermore, STMN1 expression was associated with a high rate of positivity for Ki-67, a proliferation marker. Our data suggest that STMN1 in the colonic mucosa of UC patients may be useful as an early diagnostic marker of dysplasia and colitic cancer.Copyright: © Osone et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610336>Epstein-Barr Virus-Positive Mucocutaneous Ulcers Complicate  Caused by Immune Checkpoint Regulator Therapy and Associate With Colon Perforation.</a></h1><p>Cancer therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause  and colon perforation.

Ten tissue samples were biopsies and 6 were collected during resection (4 surgeries for colon perforation). Patients were treated between 2010 and 2018 in the United Kingdom. The tissues were analyzed by pathology, in situ hybridization (to detect EBV-encoded small RNAs [EBERs]), and immunohistochemistry. Clinical data were also collected.Colon tissues from 4 of the 13 patients who received anti-CTLA4 (alone or in combination, 4 with colon perforation) had EBV-positive lymphoproliferations that manifested as florid ulcers associated with polymorphous infiltrates containing EBV-positive blasts (CD30+ or CD30-negative, CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+), plasma cells (CD138+, CD20-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), and small B cells (CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), consistent with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers (EBVMCUs). In analyses of biopsies collected from 2 patients with EBVMCUs over multiple time points, we found that earlier biopsies had no or only a few EBV-positive cells, whereas 1 later biopsy had EBVMCU and co-infection with cytomegalovirus.

The median duration of adalimumab therapy was 13. months (interquartile range, 4.0 to 32.0 months). Eight of 100 patients (8.0%) received induction therapy only, four (4.0%) of whom ultimately underwent colectomy. Of 92 patients who received adalimumab maintenance therapy, 30 (30.0%) stopped adalimumab therapy due to loss of response, and one patient (1.0%) was lost to follow-up. Among the 92 patients who received adalimumab maintenance therapy, the cumulative proportions of patients remaining on adalimumab maintenance therapy were 70.0% at 1 year and 48.9% at  years. High partial Mayo score after 8 weeks of adalimumab therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.217; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.040 to 1.425; p=0.014) and a history of exposure to two biologic agents before adalimumab therapy (HR, 4.722; CI, 1.033 to 21.586; p=0.045) were predictors of adalimumab discontinuation.Long-term outcomes of adalimumab therapy in Korean UC patients appear to be comparable to those in previously published Western studies. Furthermore, previous exposure to multiple biologic agents before adalimumab therapy and disease activity after 8 weeks of adalimumab therapy were predictors of adalimumab discontinuation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570526>Calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA1) forms non-covalent oligomers in colonic mucus and has Mucin 2-processing properties.</a></h1><p>Calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA1) is one of the major non-mucin proteins found in intestinal mucus. It is part of a larger family of CLCA proteins that share highly conserved features and domain architectures. The CLCA domain arrangement is similar to proteins belonging to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, known to process extracellular matrix proteins. Therefore, CLCA1 is an interesting candidate in the search for proteases that process intestinal mucus. Here, we investigated CLCA1's biochemical properties both in vitro and in mucus from mouse and human colon biopsy samples. Using immunoblotting with CLCA1-specific antibodies and recombinant proteins, we observed that the CLCA1 C-terminal self-cleavage product forms a disulfide-linked dimer that non-covalently interacts with the N terminal part of CLCA1, which further interacts to form oligomers. We also characterized a second, more catalytically active, N-terminal product of CLCA1, encompassing the catalytic domain together with its Willebrand domain type A (VWA). This fragment was unstable but could be identified in freshly prepared mucus. Furthermore, we found that CLCA1 can cleave the N-terminal part of the mucus structural component MUC2. We propose that CLCA1 regulates the structural arrangement of the mucus and thereby takes part in the regulation of mucus processing.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541248>Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma: Is there a difference in survival for Crohn's versus Sporadic cases?</a></h1><p>It is well known that Crohn's disease is a risk factor for the development of small bowel adenocarcinoma. However, the association between Crohn's disease-associated small bowel adenocarcinoma and survival is less understood. The goal of this study is to determine the impact of Crohn's disease on survival in small bowel adenocarcinoma.Patients with small bowel adenocarcinoma, either associated with Crohn's disease or diagnosed sporadic, were identified in the National Cancer Database from 2004-2016. The primary outcome is overall survival.Of 2,668 patients, 493 had Crohn's disease-associated small bowel adenocarcinoma and 2,175 had sporadic small bowel adenocarcinoma. Crohn's disease patients were more likely to present at a younger age (62 vs 65, p<0.001), have tumors located in the ileum (62.7% vs 25.0%, p<0.001), and have poorly differentiated tumors (47.0% vs 31.7%, p<0.001) compared to sporadic small bowel adenocarcinoma. Factors associated with significantly decreased survival included older age (HR:1.02, 95%CI:1.02-1.03, p<0.001), higher Charlson score (HR:1.39, 95%CI:1.13-1.72, p=0.002), higher tumor grade (HR:1.09, 95%CI:1.04-1.14, p<0.001), positive surgical margins (HR:1.60, 95%CI:1.39-1.84, p<0.001), and higher stage of disease (HR:1.90, 3.75, 8.13, 95%CI:1.37-2.64, 2.68-.24, .77-11.47, for II, III, IV, respectively, compared to I, all p<0.001) (Table 3). Receipt of chemotherapy was associated with significantly improved survival (HR:0.61, 95%CI:0.53-0.70, p<0.001). CD (HR:1.01, 95%CI: 0.99-1.02, p=0.39), was not significantly associated with survival.Compared to sporadic patients, Crohn's disease patients have similar overall survival and Crohn's disease is not an independent risk factor for mortality.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

Increasing evidences have showed that microRNAs (miRNAs) act as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in UC. This current study aimed to identify key miRNAs, potential target genes, and relevant pathways involved in UC to uncover their underlying molecular mechanisms by using bioinformatics analysis.The mRNA and miRNA expression profiles were retrieved and downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMIs) were obtained by using the R software package.A total of 79 DEGs and 47 DEMIs were obtained. And a panel of miRNAs and their target mRNAs were identified. It showed that miR-1231 may be a key regulator for DUOX2 and TFF1. CCL11 may be potentially targeted by miR-625. MMP1 may play vital roles in the development of UC by regulating the miR-1228/PPAR signaling pathway. In addition, we validated the most significantly up/down-expressed miRNAs (miR-92b, miR-625) and two of their corresponding target mRNAs (AQP8 and TAGAP, CCL11 and CHI3L1) in colon tissues of UC models preliminarily. The results were consistent with the microarray analysis.These findings may provide new insights into representing key mechanisms associated with the development of UC.2019 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.

The fidelity of these functions depends on the precision of intercellular signaling amongst cellular elements, including enteric neurons, epithelial cells, immune cells, and glia, all of which are vulnerable to disruptive influences during inflammatory events. This review article describes current knowledge regarding inflammation-induced neuroplasticity along key elements of enteric neural circuits, what is known about the causes of these changes, and possible therapeutic targets for protecting and/or repairing the integrity of intrinsic enteric neurotransmission. Changes that have been detected in response to inflammation include increased epithelial serotonin availability, hyperexcitability of intrinsic primary afferent neurons, facilitation of synaptic activity amongst enteric neurons, and attenuated purinergic neuromuscular transmission. Dysfunctional propulsive motility has been detected in models of , where causes include the changes described above, and in models of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune conditions, where autoantibodies are thought to mediate dysmotility.

The hypothetical influence of IFX TDM was based on an optimal therapeutic range of 6-10 mg/L for mucosal healing.Secondary loss of response (reactive TDM) was the most common indication for TDM. These patients have consistently lower median IFX levels: 3.02 mg/L (IQR 1.14 - 6.67 mg/L) vs. .22 mg/L (IQR 2.70 - 8.12 mg/L), p = 0.0001 compared with patients in remission (proactive TDM). TDM helped to identify unnecessary use of IFX in 30.6% of the TDM tests performed in luminal Crohn's disease and ulcerative  patients, with an associated drug cost saving of $531.38 per IFX TDM test episode. Unnecessary IFX use was identified in 38.9% (96/247) of reactive IFX TDM tests performed and in 19.3% (35/181) of proactive testing.Use of both reactive and proactive IFX TDM is cost-effective for IBD management as it informs the clinician where unnecessary use of IFX can be stopped.

NX-13 is a small molecule therapeutic designed to target and activate NLRX1 to induce immunometabolic changes resulting in lower inflammation and therapeutic responses in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study investigates the safety of NX-13 in a seven-day, repeat-dose general toxicity study in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at oral doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg. Weights, clinical signs, functional observational battery, clinical pathology and histopathology were used for evaluation. Daily oral dosing of NX-13 up to 1000 mg/kg did not result in any changes in weight, abnormal clinical signs or behavior. No significant differences were observed between treated and control rats in hematology or blood biochemistry. Histopathological evaluation of 12 tissues demonstrated no differences between controls and treated rats. There were no changes in weights of brain, heart, kidney, liver or spleen. Pharmacokinetic analysis of a single oral dose of NX-13 at 10 mg/kg in Sprague Dawley rats provided a maximum plasma concentration of 57 ng/mL at 0. h post-dose. Analysis of colon tissue after oral dosing with 1 and 10 mg/kg indicated high peak concentrations (10 and 100 µg/g, respectively) that scale in a dose-proportional manner. These experiments suggest that NX-13 is safe and well-tolerated in rats given oral doses as high as 1000 mg/kg with a favorable gastrointestinal localized pharmacokinetic profile, confirming NX-13 as a promising therapeutic for Crohn's disease and ulcerative .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546056>Discordance Between Patient-Reported Outcomes and Mucosal Inflammation in Patients With Mild to Moderate Ulcerative .</a></h1><p>Little is known about the association between rectal bleeding and increased stool frequency with endoscopic findings in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative  (UC). We evaluated the associations between rectal bleeding or stool frequency and endoscopic remission in this population.We performed a post-hoc analysis of data from a phase 3 non-inferiority trial of 817 adults with mild to moderate UC who received treatment with mesalazine. We obtained information on rectal bleeding, stool frequency, and Mayo endoscopic subscores (MESs) at weeks 0, 8, and 38. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values with which rectal bleeding and stool frequency identified patients with MESs of 0 and/or 1 were calculated at weeks 8 and 38 of treatment. The associations between change in rectal bleeding and stool frequency and change in MES after treatment were quantified using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.Among patients with a MES of 0, 7/82 patients (9%) had a rectal bleeding score of 1 or more and 40/82 patients (49%) had a stool frequency score of 1 or more at week 8; at week 38, 6/167 patients (4%) had a rectal bleeding score of 1 or more and 63/167 patients (38%) had a stool frequency score of 1 or more. Among patients with MESs of 0 or 1, 50/310 patients (16%) had a rectal bleeding score of 1 or more and 162/310 patients (52%) had had a stool frequency score of 1 or more at week 8; at week 38, 18/363 patients (%) had a rectal bleeding score of 1 or more and 141/363 patients (39%) had a stool frequency score of 1 or more. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients for change in rectal bleeding and stool frequency with change in MES at week 8 were 0.39 (95% CI, 0.32-0.45) and 0.34 (95% CI, 0.27-0.40), respectively. In patients with reduced MESs at week 8, 39/389 patients (10%) had unchanged or worsening rectal bleeding and 81/389 patients (21%) had unchanged or increasing stool frequencies.In a post-hoc analysis of data from a phase 3 trial of adults with mild to moderate UC treated with mesalazine, we found absence of rectal bleeding to identify patients in endoscopic remission. However, many patients in remission still have increased stool frequency, indicating that it may not be a sensitive marker of disease activity in patients with mild to moderate UC.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Topical tacrolimus is effective and safe in patients with refractory UP. However, it is not clear how tacrolimus suppositories fit into in the treatment algorithm of UP.We performed a randomized controlled, double-blind study at 8 hospitals in The Netherlands and Belgium from 2014 through 2017. Eighty-five patients with refractory UP (65% women) were randomly assigned to groups given once daily tacrolimus suppositories (2mg, n=43) or beclomethasone (3mg, n=42) for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was clinical response (decrease in Mayo score of 3 or more). Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, endoscopic response and remission, adverse events and quality of life. Outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test.Proportions of patients with clinical responses were 63% in the tacrolimus group and 59% in the beclomethasone group (P=.812); proportions of patients in clinical remission were 46% and 38%, respectively (P=.638). Proportions of patients with an endoscopic response were 68% and 60% in the tacrolimus group and in the beclomethasone group (P=.636); proportions in endoscopic remission rates were 30% and 13%, respectively (P=.092) Median increases in the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score were 18.0 in the tacrolimus group and 20. in the beclomethasone group (P=.395). Adverse event rates did not differ significantly between groups.In a 4-week randomized controlled trial, tacrolimus and beclomethasone suppositories induce comparable clinical and endoscopic responses in patients with UP refractory to -ASA. There were no significant differences in adverse events rates. Tacrolimus and beclomethasone suppositories are therefore each safe and effective treatment options for -ASA refractory disease.

SCGN interacts with the SNARE complex, which is required for vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We show that the  mutation identified impacted the localization of the SNARE complex partner, SNAP25, leading to impaired hormone release. Finally, we show that mouse models of  deficiency recapitulate impaired hormone release and susceptibility to DSS-induced . Altogether, these studies demonstrate that functional deficiency in SCGN can result in intestinal inflammation and implicates the neuroendocrine cellular compartment in IBD.© 2019, Sifuentes-Dominguez et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631316>Autoimmune blistering diseases provoked during the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease with biologic agents: a systematic review.</a></h1><p>To investigate the clinical course of autoimmune blistering diseases (AIBDs) following treatment with biologic agents (BAs) for chronic inflammatory diseases.A comprehensive review of available, published literature was performed using PubMed and CINAHL search engines. Diagnostic criteria of AIBD included positive direct immunofluorescence studies and/or positive serology with clinically suggestive features.A total of 22 cases of AIBDs provoked by the use of BAs were found. The most commonly implicated agents were tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (n = 14). The mean age of onset of AIBD was 59.4 years (median 61. years, range 31-82). Average time to onset of AIBD following initiation of the suspected BA was 33.7 ± 43.8 weeks (range 3 days to 152 weeks). Psoriasis was the most common associated condition for which the BA was prescribed (n = 11), followed by rheumatoid arthritis (n = 6) and ulcerative  (n = ). Of the 21 cases reporting AIBD outcome, 17 reported remission or complete resolution upon stopping treatment with the involved BA. Four cases reported continued bullae formation without worsening of disease following cessation of the BA or systemic corticosteroids used to treat the AIBD.

This condition severely impacts patients' quality of life, and its incidence is continuously rising. Despite constant research, current treatment options are limited and largely unsuccessful and result in serious side effects, therefore new therapy alternatives are needed. Liposomal formulation provides a new hope for disease management. In our study, we characterized the anti-inflammatory activity of mesalazine (-ASA) and chlorogenic acid (CGA) encapsulated in liposomal formulation in the animal model of CD. Liposomes were obtained by thin film hydration method and characterized in terms of suspension stability and particle size and distribution.  was induced in mice by intracolonic (i.c.) administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). The effect of treatment with liposomal suspensions of -ASA and CGA was evaluated macroscopically and by measuring myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. We observed that liposome-encapsulated -ASA ( mg/kg), but not CGA (20 mg/kg) attenuated  as evidenced by a decreased macroscopic and microscopic scores. It may be hypothesized that the composition of liposomal lipid bilayer as well as the switch in macrophage populations leading to unfavorable accumulation of anti-inflammatory agents in the cells may underly the efficiency of obtained liposomes and need to be taken into consideration in further studies on drug delivery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504513>Health Care Cost for Children Newly Diagnosed With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>The increasing incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), along with more extensive and severe disease in children, raises concern for related health care expenditures.The aim of this study was to quantify and characterize costs of pediatric IBD in the year following diagnosis.We identified all patients diagnosed with IBD at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in 2016 with a minimum of 1 year follow-up. Clinical and demographic factors were recorded at diagnosis. We examined paid service and professional costs related to outpatient medications and infusions, outpatient procedures and radiology imaging, inpatient services, and outpatient visits. Actual dollar reimbursements were from private and public payers. Data is reported as mean ± SD and median (IQR).First-year cost data were collected on 67 patients (43 Crohn's disease [CD], 24 ulcerative  [UC], mean age 13 years [SD 3.22]) revealing a mean cost of $45,753 (SD $37,938), with $43,095 (SD $30,828) for CD and $50,516 (SD $48,557) for UC. Severe CD (n = 11) had a mean cost of $71,176 (SD $43,817) and severe UC (n = ) $134,178 (SD $40,920). Patients receiving infusion therapy had a mean cost of $59,376 (SD $38,724) compared with $27,903 (SD $28,795) for those not receiving infusions. Overall cost distribution showed 37% from infusion costs, 25% hospital costs, 18% outpatient procedures, 10% outpatient oral medications, 7% outpatient imaging, and 3% outpatient visits.Infusion therapy is a key driver of first-year costs for children newly diagnosed with IBD. Understanding cost distribution in relation to disease presentation can be helpful to anticipate future related costs.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press.

UC is estimated to afflict hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone. In addition to traditional colonoscopy, ultrasonic techniques can detect , but have limited spatial resolution, which frequently results in underdiagnoses. Nevertheless, clinical diagnosis of  is still generally performed via colonoscopy. Optical techniques such as confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been proposed to detect UC with higher resolution. However, UC can potentially alter tissue biomechanical properties, providing additional contrast for earlier and potentially more accurate detection. Although clinically available elastography techniques have been immensely useful, they do not have the resolution for imaging small tissues, such as in small mammalian disease models. However, OCT-based elastography, optical coherence elastography (OCE), is well-suited for imaging the biomechanical properties of small mammal colon tissue.In this work, we induced elastic waves in  mouse colon tissue using a focused air-pulse. The elastic waves were detected using a phase-stabilized swept source OCE system, and the wave velocity was translated into stiffness. Measurements were taken at six positions for each sample to assess regional sample elasticity. Additional contrast between the control and diseased tissue was detected by analyzing the dispersion of the elastic wave and tissue optical properties obtained from the OCT structural image.The results show distinct differences (P<0.05) in the stiffness between control and  disease samples, with a Young's modulus of 11.8±8.0 and .1±1. kPa, respectively. The OCT signal standard deviations for control and diseased samples were .8±0.3 and .±0.2 dB, respectively. The slope of the OCT signal spatial frequency decay in the control samples was 92.7±10.0 and 87.3±4.7 dB∙µm in the  samples. The slope of the linearly fitted dispersion curve in the control samples was 1. mm, and 0.8 mm in the  samples.Our results show that OCE can be utilized to distinguish tissue based on stiffness and optical properties. Our estimates of tissue stiffness suggest that the healthy colon tissue was stiffer than diseased tissue. Furthermore, structural analysis of the tissue indicates a distinct difference in tissue optical properties between the healthy and UC-like diseased tissue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560042>Utilization of Diagnostic Imaging and Ionization Radiation Exposure Among an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Inception Cohort.</a></h1><p>Abdominal imaging is important in managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We characterized utilization of imaging and exposure to ionizing radiation.We enumerated abdominal diagnostic imaging in a population-based cohort of IBD patients between 1994 and 2016. Trends in utilization of abdominal computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound were characterized. Cumulative doses of ionizing radiation were compared between IBD patients and non-IBD controls and between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC) patients. Regression models were constructed to assess predictors of high ionizing radiation exposure.There were 72,933 incident cases of IBD. During the first  years of diagnosis, IBD patients were exposed to nearly 6-fold higher exposure to cumulative ionizing radiation attributable to abdominal imaging compared with non-IBD controls (18.6 mSv vs 2.9 mSv). Cumulative ionizing radiation exposure was higher in CD than UC (26.0 mSv vs 12.0 mSv; P < 0.001). Crohn's disease patients were more than twice as likely as UC patients to exceed 50 mSv (15.6% vs 6.2%; P < 0.001) and 100 mSV (.0% vs 2.1%; P < 0.001). There was geographic variation in ionizing radiation exposure, and individuals of lower income were more likely to have high exposure. Utilization of abdominal MRI has increased substantially, peaking between 2007 and 2012 and increasing annually at 34%, which coincided with an annual 2% decline in the use of abdominal CT.Crohn's disease patients are at highest risk for high exposure to ionizing radiation, with a subgroup receiving potentially harmful levels. Increasing utilization and access to abdominal MRI may alleviate exposure.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

A municipal hospital does not indicate a small hospital. The most significant difference between a municipal hospital and a center or university hospital is that most surgeons in a municipal hospital are general surgeons.The first 30 patients who underwent RRS at the municipal hospital were enrolled between April 2015 and June 2016. All surgeries were performed by a single trained surgeon using the da Vinci Si surgical system. The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative major complications.Of the study patients, 29 had adenocarcinoma and 1 had ulcerative . The surgical procedures included anterior resection (n = 22), intersphincteric resection (n = 2), abdominoperineal resection (n = 4), Hartmann's procedure (n = 1), and total coloproctectomy (n = 1).

However, previous studies have suggested conflicting results on the conditions of occurrence of ICI-induced vitiligo.The aim of this study was to describe the occurrences and outcomes of several cases of ICI-induced vitiligo.A retrospective study was carried out using the French Pharmacovigilance Database (FPD) between the beginning of the commercialization of ICI in France and 1 January 2019, selecting for analysis the vitiligo reactions of patients due to treatment with ICI.Among the 95 case patients identified in the FPD, the median times to onset of vitiligo after the start of pembrolizumab, nivolumab and ipilimumab therapies were .4, .0, and 3.8 months, respectively. Furthermore, 37 patients (45%) discontinued ICI treatment due to disease progression. The median follow-up time of all patients was 33 months (interquartile range 2-56).This study provided an overall picture of ICI-induced vitiligo in daily medical practice on a large number of pharmacovigilance observations of case patients. Among the observations of ICI-induced vitiligo, the diagnosed cancer was melanoma for almost all patients. Most patients in the study experienced other associated adverse drug reactions (ADRs), such as , pruritus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, pancreatitis, and gastritis.

This study was aimed to assess the function of PD-L1 expressed on ERCs in  attenuation. ERCs with and without anti-PD-L1 mAb-pretreatment were administered to mice by injection at 2,  and 8 days after  induction by DSS treatment.

Both patients experienced  after nivolumab administration. Pathological examination of the colon showed robust infiltration of CD8 cells and T-bet expressing CD4 cells in both cases, indicating helper T cells (Th) 1 to be responsible for the dominant response. Additionally, we observed the serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) reflected the clinical course of irAEs clearly in the two cases.Our two cases suggested that the development of irAEs due to nivolumab is associated with Th1 dominant response. CRP as well as IL-6 was found to be a potential biomarker for irAEs.

In IFX-treated patients, IFX-TC, Vit-D and CRP levels were associated independently with clinical remission with an OR of 20 (95% CI 1.3-333, p = 0.03), 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.7, p = 0.02) and 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-0.8, p = 0.01) respectively. Serum IFX-TC and Vit-D levels correlated positively (r = 0.39, p = 0.001), while serum IFX-TC and CRP levels showed an inverse correlation (r = -0.43, p < 0.001). Only -IFX-TC associated independently with biochemical remission with a threshold of 3.1 µg/mL. In ADA-treated patients, ADA-TC associated independently with clinical and biochemical remission with an OR of 2. (95% CI 1.1-.0, p = 0.04) and 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.4, p = 0.03) respectively. The serum zinc level was associated neither with clinical nor with biochemical remission in either cohort.Our results indicate that serum Vit-D level may be a predictive marker in addition to drug trough levels in IBD patients treated with IFX. Furthermore, due to the correlation between serum IFX and Vit-D levels, Vit-D substitution should be conducted in patients with low Vit-D levels.© 2019 S.

The repair function of TLR4 in the intestinal epithelium is still unknown. Here, wild-type (WT) mice, TLR4-knockout mice (KO; TLR4) and commensal-depleted mice were used as dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced or radiation-induced  and injury models to explore the role of TLR4 signaling in intestinal injury. Exogenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) promoted DSS-induced inflammatory cytokines and aggravated intestinal damage. TLR4 deficiency and commensal bacterial depletion inhibited the toxic effects of LPS, but these mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced and radiation-induced intestinal damage. Compared with WT mice, neither DSS nor radiation promoted production of more inflammatory cytokines in the guts of TLR4-KO and commensal-depleted mice. Introducing the cytokine repair factors, PGE2 and GM-CSF, increased the cytokine levels in the guts of DSS-induced  mice. We hypothesized that TLR4 and its ligands repaired the epithelium after DSS-induced and radiation-induced intestinal damage by upregulating PGE and GM-CSF. Transwell migration assays suggested that LPS, IL6, TNF, PGE and GM-CSF promoted intestinal cell migration, and cell viability analysis suggested that these factors protected against radiation-induced intestinal damage. Our data underscore the importance of the balancing role of TLR4 in intestinal injury and repair.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

FC is noninvasive, economical, simple, and acceptable for patients. Levels of FC have proven reliable for intestinal inflammation, with good clinical sensitivity, and are useful in screening and monitoring inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as well as in the differential diagnosis between IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Given its advantages, FC represents an attractive biomarker that could be utilized in various gastrointestinal (GI) diseases apart from IBD, and is currently being studied extensively by many research groups with significant amounts of data emerging. In this current review we aim to provide an outline of the utility of FC in distinguishing between IBS and IBD, as well as an up-to-date summary of the available clinical experience concerning FC in various common conditions of the GI tract commonly encountered by gastroenterology practitioners, such as IBS, microscopic , acute gastroenteritis,  infection, colorectal cancer, diverticular disease, coeliac disease, and other GI conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671928>Presentation and outcomes among inflammatory bowel disease patients with concurrent pneumatosis intestinalis: a case series and systematic review.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves chronic inflammation of the colon with ulcerative  (UC), and the colon and/or small intestine with Crohn's disease (CD). Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI), characterized by compromise of the intestinal wall with gas-filled cysts, has rarely been reported with IBD. The presentation, best management and outcomes of PI with IBD are poorly defined.We conducted a search for PI in all abdominal computed tomography (CT) reports at 2 large tertiary care hospitals from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2017, cross referenced to ICD codes for IBD. CT and chart review was performed to confirm PI and IBD respectively. A systematic review excluding case reports was performed for PI with IBD for comparison.Of ,990 patients with a CT abdomen report mentioning PI, we identified 11 cases of PI with IBD, 4 UC, 6 CD, and 1 indeterminate . PI was limited to the small bowel in  patients, the right colon in , and small bowel and colonic in 1. All 3 mortalities had CD, small intestinal PI and portal/mesenteric venous gas. The systematic literature search identified 9 articles describing 58 patients with IBD and PI. These cases were mostly included in larger cohorts of PI patients without extractable data on presentation or outcomes in the IBD subpopulation.Ours appears to be the first reporting of presentations and outcomes, outside of case reports, for those with PI and IBD. The high mortality for those with CD and PI of the small bowel appears to define a group requiring more than supportive medical care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524013>IgE-sensitization to food and inhalant allergens in IBD patients compared with normal blood donors at Oslo University Hospital, Norway.</a></h1><p> Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC) have been regarded as autoimmune Th-1/Th-17- and Th-2-associated conditions, respectively. The aim of the study was to examine possible differences in allergen sensitization between these diseases and relative to normal blood donors (BD).  Plasma from 29 UC and 37 CD patients with moderate disease activity and 100 healthy age- and gender-matched BD, were analyzed for specific IgE to 22 food- and 28 inhalation allergens using EUROLINE atopy screen.  There was significantly higher proportion of allergen sensitized patients in UC compared to BD. Corresponding mean percentages for UC, CD and BD were 8., 8.9 ( = .2) and .9 ( = .04). There was no intergroup difference in sensitization to food allergens. Most prominent result was the double level of sensitization to inhalants in CD (15%) compared to BD (8%) ( = .03). Overall highest levels of sensitization to inhalants were for grass pollens. Interestingly, the number of allergens ( = 50) the subjects were sensitized to, was significantly lower among UC ( = 20; 40%) ( = .0005) than CD ( = 31; 62%) and BD ( = 38; 76%).  The percentage of individuals sensitized to inhalants in CD and to inhalants and foods in UC, were higher than corresponding results in BD. However, whereas allergen positive reactions in CD were comparable to those in BD, they were reduced in UC because of the few UC reactions to food allergens. This contrasts previous data and the study also points to sensitization to inhalants as a potential factor in the complex pathogenesis of IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636478>Quality of life, work productivity impairment and healthcare resources in inflammatory bowel diseases in Brazil.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have been associated with a low quality of life (QoL) and a negative impact on work productivity compared to the general population. Information about disease control, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources is relevant to optimizing IBD management.To describe QoL and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources among IBD patients in Brazil.A multicenter cross-sectional study included adult outpatients who were previously diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative  (UC). At enrolment, active CD and UC were defined as having a Harvey Bradshaw Index ≥ 8 or a CD Activity Index ≥ 220 or calprotectin > 200 µg/g or previous colonoscopy results suggestive of inadequate control (per investigator criteria) and a 9-point partial Mayo score ≥ , respectively. The PRO assessment included the QoL questionnaires SF-36 and EQ-5D-5L, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), and the WPAI questionnaire. Information about healthcare resources and treatment during the previous 3 years was collected from medical records. Chi-square, Fisher's exact and Student's -/Mann-Whitney  tests were used to compare PROs, treatment patterns and the use of healthcare resources by disease activity (α = 0.05).Of the 407 patients in this study (CD/UC: 64.9%/35.1%, mean age 42.9/45.9 years, 54.2%/56.6% female, 38.3%/37.1% employed), 44.7%/25.2% presented moderate-to-severe CD/UC activity, respectively, at baseline. Expressed in median values for CD/UC, respectively, the SF-36 physical component was 46.6/44.7 and the mental component was 45.2/44.2, the EQ-visual analog scale score was 80.0/70.0, and the IBDQ overall score was 164.0/165.0. Moderate to severe activity, female gender, being unemployed, a lower educational level and lower income were associated with lower QoL ( < 0.05). Median work productivity impairment was 20% and % for CD and UC patients, respectively, and activity impairment was 30%, the latter being higher among patients with moderate to severe disease activity compared to patients with mild or no disease activity (75.0%  10.0%,  < 0.001). For CD/UC patients, respectively, 25.4%/2.8% had at least one surgery, 38.3%/19.6% were hospitalized, and 70.7%/77.6% changed IBD treatment at least once during the last 3 years. The most common treatments at baseline were biologics (75.3%) and immunosuppressants (70.9%) for CD patients and -ASA compounds (77.%) for UC patients.Moderate to severe IBD activity, especially among CD patients, is associated with a substantial impact on QoL, work productivity impairment and an increased number of IBD surgeries and hospitalizations in Brazil.©The Author(s) 2019.

It affects more than 3. million people in the western world and places a huge financial burden on healthcare systems. IBD is highly heterogeneous; disease severity and outcomes in IBD are highly variable, and patients may experience episodes of relapse and remission. However, treatment often follows a step-up model whereby the patients start with anti-inflammatory agents (corticosteroids or immunosuppressants) and step-up to monoclonal anti-tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) antibodies and then other biologics if the initial drugs cannot control disease. Unfortunately, many patients do not respond to the costly biologics, and thus often still require gut-resective surgery, which decreases quality of life. In order to decrease rates of surgery and ineffective treatments, it is important to identify markers that accurately predict disease progression and treatment responses, to inform decisions about the best choice of therapeutics. Here we examine molecular approaches to patient stratification that aim to increase the effectiveness of treatments and potentially reduce healthcare costs. In the future, it may become possible to stratify patients based on their suitability for specific molecular-targeted therapeutic agents, and eventually use molecular stratification for personalised medicine in IBD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Its insufficiency has negative impact also on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) where it is often present. The recommended daily intake for general population is 600 UI/day (units/day). What is the necessary dose for IBD patients remains unknown. The aim of the study was to verify whether the 2,000 IU/day of vitD is sufficient for maintaining sustained levels in these patients.Patients with Crohns disease (CD) or ulcerative  (UC) were supplemented orally with 2,000 IU of cholecalciferol daily during winter time. The level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was established at the beginning of substitution period (October to December) and in Month 4. Demographic data, Ca, P, parathormone levels, dose of vitD used, and patients compliance were observed.108 patients with CD and UC (71/37) were analysed, out of them 51 females, average age 43.3 ± 16.2 years. The level of 25OHD increased from 60.2 ± 26. nmol/l to 68.1 ± 27.1 nmol/l (p &lt; 0.001) during the period with the average substitution dose of vitD 1&#8239;858 ± 464 IU/day. 60.2 % of subjects complied with the recommended dosing of vitD. The dose of 1,820 IU vitD/day showed to be sufficient for maintaining sustained levels in the model. No changes of Ca, P serum levels occurred during observation period.Substitution doses of vitD recommended for general population are insufficient for IBD patients. A dose of up to 2,000/day, which is safe, is necessary to maintain normal levels of 25OHD.

Retrospective Comparison of Toxicity and Efficacy on 222 Patients in the First 100 Days After Transplant, On Behalf of the Romanian Society for Bone Marrow Transplantation.</a></h1><p>High-dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is widely used in patients with malignant lymphomas. In Europe over 8,000 ASCTs for lymphoma were performed out of a total of 40,000 transplants according to the European Bone Marrow Transplant (EBMT) activity survey in 2017. ASCT is considered the standard treatment for eligible patients failing to achieve remission after first line chemotherapy or patients with relapsed or refractory lymphomas, including classical Hodkin's lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma, as well as consolidation therapy in first remission in mantle cell lymphoma. BEAM (BCNU/carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) is the most commonly used conditioning regimen for ASCT in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) lymphomas in Europe, whereas the CBV (cyclophosphamide, BCNU, and etoposide) regimen is also widely used in North America. Recently, concerns regarding BCNU toxicity as well as restricted availability of BCNU and melphalan has determined an increasing number of transplant centers to use alternative conditioning regimens. Currently, only a few comparative studies, most of them retrospective, between different conditioning protocols regarding efficacy and toxicity have been published. Thus, in the current manuscript, we report the experience of 2 transplant centers in ASCT in R/R lymphomas with three types of conditioning: BEAM, CLV (cyclophosphamide, lomustine, etoposide) and LEAM (lomustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan), with the aim to evaluate the results of alternative conditioning regimens using lomustine (LEAM and CLV) and compare them with the standard BEAM regarding early toxicity, engraftment, and transplant related mortality (TRM). All patients developed grade IV neutropenia, anemia with/without transfusion necessity. Severe thrombocytopenia with transfusion requirements is reported in most cases. Median time to platelet engraftment and neutrophil engraftment was 13 days (range) and 10 days (range), respectively. Gastrointestinal toxicity was the most common non-hematologic toxicity after all three conditioning regimens. Oral mucositis in various grades from I to IV was diagnosed in most cases. Other side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, , and skin rash but with low severity grades. For the LEAM arm, one patient died after transplant, before engrafting, one patient didn't achieve platelet engraftment in day 100, one patient developed grade 3 upper gastrointestinal bleeding, one patient died (grade  toxicity) with acute renal failure, one patient developed hypoxic events up to grade 4 acute respiratory failure and one patient developed grade 3 itchy skin rash. For the CLV arm, one patient died after transplant, before engrafting, one patient developed grade 3 , one patient with grade 3 hepatic cytolysis, one patient with cardiac toxicity followed by death (grade ) caused by an acute myocardial infarction with ST elevation and one patient with pulmonary toxicity clinically manifested with grade 3 pleurisy. For the BEAM arm, one patient developed grade 3 cardiac toxicity with sinus bradycardia and afterwards grade 4 with acute pulmonary edema, three patients presented a grade 3 pruritic skin rash and two patients developed grade 3 seizures. In the present study we presented the differences that were observed between BEAM, LEAM, and CLV conditioning regimens offering clinical arguments for an SCT practitioner choice in the ideal situation, but also of choice for alternative regimens in the case that one regimen cannot be used.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565850>Taraxacum officinale extract ameliorates dextran sodium sulphate-induced  by regulating fatty acid degradation and microbial dysbiosis.</a></h1><p>Numerous data show that taraxacum officinale extract (TOE) exerts protective effects on inflammatory diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms by which TOE affects dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced  remain unclear. After DSS-induced  were treated with different concentrations of TOE for 8 days, the bodyweight, disease activity index (DAI), colon lengths and pathological scoring were assessed, and histopathological examination was confirmed by HE staining. Furthermore, a transcriptome sequencing was performed by using the colon tissues between TOE and DSS groups, and the differentially expressed genes were conducted for the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and were validated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. In addition, a 16S rDNA sequencing was carried out to distinguish the differential gut microbiota by using the mouse faecal samples between TOE and DSS groups. We found that TOE attenuated the clinical symptoms, lowered the inflammatory scoring and inhibited the secretion of proinflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in DSS-induced . KEGG and GSEA analysis demonstrated that fatty acid degradation and cytokine-receptor signalling were predominantly enriched in TOE-treated  as compared with the DSS group. Further investigations revealed that TOE increased the expression levels of Adh5, Aldh3a2 and Acox3, but decreased those of CCL20, CCR6 and CXCL1/ in DSS-induced , where TOE also induced the enrichment of S24-7 and adlercreutzia, but decreased the amount of anaerostipes, enterococcus, enterobacteriaceae and peptostreptococcaceae. In conclusion, TOE ameliorated DSS-induced  by regulating fatty acid degradation and microbial dysbiosis.© 2019 The Authors.

Laquinimod (LAQ), a poorly water-soluble compound, was proved to be effective for  remission at low dose of 0. mg/kg in patients with Crohn's disease. Due to its extremely low solubility in water, it was difficult to develop an injectable liquid dosage form. Herein, D-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS) polymeric micelles were developed as a delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Using the LAQ/TPGS ratio of 1:100, LAQ-loaded micelles were successfully prepared by thin-film dispersion method. The solubility of LAQ in water was significantly increased from 10. μg/mL in pure water to 500 μg/mL in TPGS micelles. LAQ-loaded micelles of TPGS exhibited the fine particle size of 34.6 nm and Zeta potential of -0.67 mV. Moreover, the good stability of LAQ-loaded micelles in physiology-mimicking medium was confirmed by detecting their particle size, zeta potential and leakage of the loading drug. Therapeutic effect of LAQ-loaded micelles on DSS-induced mice was proved by detecting DAI score, colon length and loss of body weight. Moreover, the morphology and colonic mucosal barrier of the injured colon of DSS-induced mice was largely recovered after treatment with LAQ-loaded micelles. Meanwhile, the inflammation of  colon was also obviously alleviated by LAQ-loaded micelles. Conclusively, polymeric micelles of TPGS may be a promising delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This procedure is invasive and does not exclude small-bowel Crohn's disease (CD). Current therapeutic goals include mucosal healing which may lead to an increased number of endoscopic procedures in many patients. The small-bowel colon capsule endoscopy (SBC-CE) system visualizes the small bowel and colon. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance and adverse events of SBC-CE in patients with UC.   This was a prospective, feasibility study involving two study sites. Patients with active UC underwent SBC-CE and colonoscopy. Kappa statistics were performed to assess the agreement between SBC-CE and colonoscopy. Adverse events (AEs) data were collected throughout and following the procedure.   In total, 30 consecutive patients were recruited, and 23 of those were included in the final analysis. For the primary end point, evaluation of the extent of UC disease in the colon, the percent agreement between SBC-CE and colonoscopy was moderate (56. %); kappa coefficient 0.42. The percent agreement between SBC-CE and colonoscopy for UC disease activity, based on Mayo endoscopic sub-score, was 95.7 %; kappa coefficient 0.86. Disease activity in the more proximal small bowel was detected in two patients with SBC-CE.

However, data on the natural history of perianal fistulizing CD (pfCD) in this population are scarce. In a population-based cohort study, we described the prevalence, natural history and treatment of pfCD in patients with elderly-onset CD vs. patients with pediatric-onset CD.All patients diagnosed with CD at or after the age of 60 between 1988 and 2006 were included (n=372). Logistic regression, Cox models, and a nested case-control method were used to identify factors associated with pfCD.Thirty-four elderly patients (9%) had pfCD at diagnosis. After a median follow-up of 6 years [IQR: 3-10], 59 patients (16%) had pfCD; the same prevalence (16%) was observed in pediatric-onset patients. At last follow-up, anal incontinence was more frequent in elderly patients with pfCD than in elderly patients without pfCD (22% vs. 4%, respectively; p<10-4). Rectal CD at diagnosis was associated with pfCD (hazard ratio [95% CI]=2.8 [1.6-.0]). Although 37% of the patients received immunosuppressants and 17% received anti-tumour necrosis factor agents, 24% (14 out of 59) had a definitive stoma at last follow-up.During the first 6 years of disease, the prevalence of pfCD was similar in elderly and pediatric patients. Rectal involvement was associated with the appearance of pfCD in elderly-onset patients. Around a quarter of patients with elderly-onset CD will have a stoma. Our results suggest that treatment with biologics should be evaluated in these patients.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press.

We sought to assess the rates of surgical complications and mortality in patients aged ≥65 years after colectomy for ulcerative  (UC).This is a single center retrospective study at a tertiary care center. We reviewed all hospital discharges with ICD-9 code 556.X between January 2002 and January 2014. Patients were included if they underwent a colectomy for UC. All records were manually reviewed for demographics, complications and mortality within 90 days postoperatively.A total of 259 patients underwent surgery for UC during the study period and 34 patients were ≥65 years old (range 65-82) at the time of their surgery. There was no difference in overall length of stay (10. days vs. 9.6 days; P = 0.645) or complication rates (44% vs. 47%; P = 0.854) in the ≥65 cohort compared with the under 65 cohort.

Acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate mucus production and suppress Th2 inflammation through nicotinic receptors in lungs but UC is rarely observed in smokers and the mechanism of the protection is unclear.In order to evaluate whether acetylcholine can ameliorate UC-associated pathologies, we employed a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC-like conditions, and a group of mice were treated with Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) to increase acetylcholine availability. The effects on colonic tissue morphology, Th2 inflammatory factors, MUC2 mucin, and gut microbiota were analyzed.DSS challenge damaged the murine colonic architecture, reduced the MUC2 mucin and the tight-junction protein ZO-1. The PB treatment significantly attenuated these DSS-induced responses along with the eosinophilic infiltration and the pro-Th2 inflammatory factors. Moreover, PB inhibited the DSS-induced loss of commensal Clostridia and Flavobacteria, and the gain of pathogenic Erysipelotrichia and Fusobacteria.Together, these data suggest that in colons of a murine model, PB promotes MUC2 synthesis, suppresses Th2 inflammation and attenuates bacterial dysbiosis therefore, PB has a therapeutic potential in UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483522>Systematic review with meta-analysis: association between vedolizumab trough concentration and clinical outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h1><p>There has been limited evaluation of the association between vedolizumab trough concentration and clinical outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the potential role of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for vedolizumab.Through a systematic literature search through 28 February 2019, we identified five cohort studies (558 patients, 42% with ulcerative ) reporting the association between vedolizumab trough concentration and clinical outcomes in patients with IBD. We calculated mean difference (MD) in vedolizumab trough concentration in patients achieving vs not achieving clinical outcomes, and qualitatively synthesized thresholds associated with favourable outcomes.In patients with UC, median vedolizumab trough concentrations were consistently higher in patients achieving clinical remission (median, 14.3 μg/mL vs 10. μg/mL; MD, .1 μg/mL, 95% CI, 2.8-7.4) or endoscopic remission (median, 13.0 μg/mL vs 9.7; MD, .1 μg/mL, 95% CI, 2.2-7.9). In patients with CD, there was no significant difference in median vedolizumab trough concentrations in patients achieving vs not achieving clinical remission (MD, 2.0 μg/mL; 95% CI, -0. to 4.) or endoscopic remission (MD, 3.6 μg/mL; 95% CI, -1.4 to 8.6). In patients with UC, week 6 vedolizumab trough concentrations ≥18.-20.8 μg/mL, and maintenance trough concentrations ≥9.0-12.6 μg/mL were associated with favourable clinical outcomes. Antibodies to vedolizumab were reported in 1.7%-3.0% patients on maintenance therapy.Based on meta-analysis, patients with UC who achieve endoscopic and clinical remission have significantly higher vedolizumab trough concentration during maintenance therapy. Vedolizumab trough concentration >20 μg/mL at week 6, and >12 μg/mL during maintenance may be associated with better outcomes, though cause-effect relationship remains unclear. Prospective studies on reactive and proactive therapeutic drug monitoring of vedolizumab (vs empiric dose escalation) are warranted.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461996>Vitamin D Deficiency is Associated with Increased Disease Activity in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Vitamin D has an inhibitory role in the inflammatory signaling pathways and supports the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Due to its immunomodulatory effect, vitamin D plays a role in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and a deficiency is associated with an increased risk for a flare. We aimed to investigate to what extent the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D3) level correlates with disease activity and whether a cut-off value can be defined that discriminates between active disease and remission.Patients with IBD, treated at the University Hospital Frankfurt were analyzed retrospectively. The 25(OH)D3 levels were correlated with clinical activity indices and laboratory chemical activity parameters. A deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D3 levels <30 ng/mL.A total of 470 (257 female) patients with IBD were included, 272 (57.9%) with Crohn's disease (CD), 198 (42.1%) with ulcerative  (UC). The median age of the patients was 41 (18-84). In 283 patients (60.2%), a vitamin D deficiency was detected. 245 (53.6%) patients received oral vitamin D supplementation, and supplemented patients had significantly higher vitamin D levels (p < 0.0001). Remission, vitamin D substitution, and male gender were independently associated with the 25(OH)D3 serum concentration in our cohort in regression analysis. A 25(OH)D3 serum concentration of 27. ng/mL was the optimal cut-off value.Vitamin D deficiency is common in IBD patients and appears to be associated with increased disease activity. In our study, vitamin D levels were inversely associated with disease activity. Thus, close monitoring should be established, and optimized supplementation should take place.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583091>Inflammatory bowel disease in patients undergoing renal biopsies.</a></h1><p>There are no good data in the literature on the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with kidney disease and we do not know whether IBD affects the course of kidney disease or if the type of IBD is an influential factor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of IBD among patients who have undergone renal biopsies due to clinical indications and to elucidate whether the presence of IBD influences renal and patient outcomes.We collected retrospective data on concomitant diseases, especially IBD, from adult patients undergoing renal biopsy for any clinical indication between 2000 and 2012 at Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland. Information was systematically collected on the activity of IBD, medication for IBD, surgery performed for IBD and markers of kidney function.Of the 819 patients biopsied, 35 (4.3%) had IBD. The prevalence of IBD was 13.3 and 4.6% in patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) and immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), respectively. In comparison, the prevalence of IBD in the Finnish population is 0.6%. Ulcerative  and Crohn's disease were equally represented. The presence of IBD showed no impact on renal and patient outcomes.IBD should not be overlooked in patients undergoing renal biopsies, especially those diagnosed with TIN or IgAN. The renal findings did not associate with the activity of intestinal inflammation. Whether a concomitant IBD truly affects the course of chronic kidney disease should be examined in further studies.© The Author(s) 2019.

We hypothesized that mRNA profiles could (1) identify genes and pathways involved in disease pathogenesis; (2) identify a molecular signature that differentiates IBD from other conditions; (3) provide insight into systemic and colon-specific dysregulation through study of the concordance of the gene expression.Children (8-18 years) were prospectively recruited at the time of diagnostic colonoscopy for possible IBD. We used transcriptome-wide mRNA profiling to study gene expression in colon biopsies and paired whole blood samples. Using blood mRNA measurements, we fit a regression model for disease state prediction that was validated in an independent test set of adult subjects (GSE3365).Ninety-eight children were recruited [39 Crohn's disease, 18 ulcerative , 2 IBDU, 39 non-IBD]. There were 1,118 significantly differentially (IBD vs non-IBD) expressed genes in colon tissue, and 880 in blood. The direction of relative change in expression was concordant for 106/112 genes differentially expressed in both tissue types. The regression model from the blood mRNA measurements distinguished IBD vs non-IBD disease status in the independent test set with 80% accuracy using only 6 genes. The overlap of  immune and metabolic pathways in the two tissue types was significant (p<0.001).Blood and colon tissue from patients with IBD share a common transcriptional profile dominated by immune and metabolic pathways. Our results suggest that peripheral blood expression levels of as few as 6 genes (IL7R, UBB, TXNIP, S100A8, ALAS2, and SLC2A3) may distinguish patients with IBD from non-IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507346>Parasitic Infections.</a></h1><p>Parasitic infections of the gastrointestinal tract are a cause of morbidity to millions of individuals worldwide. These parasites are endemic in underdeveloped countries with poor sanitation allowing for spread through contaminated water supplies. While much is known about these parasites, the cutaneous manifestations caused by infection are infrequently reported in the literature. The deposition of the parasites into the perianal region often leads to significant skin irritation. Cutaneous findings vary from a mild pruritus ani to a macular rash to even severe perianal ulceration.

The present study aimed to determine the prevalence and patient-specific characteristics associated with polypharmacy in an ulcerative  (UC) population and to assess the impact of polypharmacy on disease outcomes.A retrospective chart review of patients with UC who visited a tertiary medical center outpatient clinic between 2006 and 2011 was performed. Polypharmacy was defined as major ( ≥  non-UC medications) or minor (2-4 non-UC medications). UC medications were excluded in the polypharmacy grouping to minimize the confounding between disease severity and polypharmacy. Outcomes of interest include disease flare, therapy escalation, UC-related hospitalization, and surgery within  years of the initial visit.A total of 457 patients with UC were eligible for baseline analysis. Major polypharmacy was identified in 29.8% of patients, and minor polypharmacy was identified in 40.9% of the population. Polypharmacy at baseline was associated with advanced age (P< 0.001), female sex (P= 0.019), functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (P< 0.001), and psychiatric disease (P< 0.001). Over  years of follow-up, 265 patients remained eligible for analysis. After adjusting for age, sex, functional GI disorders, and psychiatric disease, major polypharmacy was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of disease flare (odds ratio, 4.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.66-9.62). However, major polypharmacy was not associated with the risk of therapy escalation, hospitalization, or surgery.Polypharmacy from non-inflammatory bowel disease medications was present in a substantial proportion of adult patients with UC and was associated with an increased risk of disease flare.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526112>Pathology Associated With an Outbreak of Entamoebiasis in Wild Cane Toads () in Tropical Australia.</a></h1><p>Infection due to  is known to cause serious disease in primates () and snakes (), but there are no detailed descriptions of the pathology associated with  infection in amphibians.

The aim of this study was to compare the dysplasia detection rate of high-definition white light endoscopy with random biopsy (HDWL-R) vs high-definition chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsy (HDCE-T).This was a multicenter, prospective randomized controlled trial involving 9 tertiary teaching hospitals in South Korea. A total of 210 patients with long-standing ulcerative  were randomized to undergo either the HDWL-R group (n = 102) or HDCE-T group (n = 108). The detection rates of -associated dysplasia (CAD) or all colorectal neoplasia from each trial arm were compared.There was no significant difference in the CAD detection rate between HDCE-T and HDWL-R groups (4/102, 3.9% vs 6/108, .6%, P = 0.749). However, HDCE-T showed a trend toward improved colorectal neoplasia detection compared with HDWL-R (21/102, 20.6% vs 13/108, 12.0%, P = 0.093).

Telemedicine-based health services may potentially bridge gaps in access to gastroenterologists in remote and underserved areas.We conducted a needs assessment for IBD specialist care in Ontario using health administrative data. As part of a separate initiative to address geographic disparities in access to care, we described the development and implementation of our Promoting Access and Care through Centres of Excellence (PACE) Telemedicine Program. Over the first 18 months, we measured wait times and potential cost savings.We found substantial deficiencies in specialist care early in the course of IBD and continuous IBD care in regions where the number of gastroenterologists per capita were low. The PACE Telemedicine Program enabled new IBD consultations within a median time of 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 7-32 days) and visits for active IBD symptoms with a median time of 8. days (IQR, 4-14 days). Forty-five percent of new consultations and 83% of patients with active IBD symptoms were seen within the target wait time of two weeks. Telemedicine services resulted in an estimated cost savings of $47,565 among individuals who qualified for Ontario's Northern Travel Grant.The implementation of telemedicine services for IBD is highly feasible and can reduce wait times to see gastroenterologists that meet nationally recommended targets and can lead to cost savings.© The Author(s) 2018.

In advanced gastric cancer (AGC) patients, there have been few reports about the correlation between irAEs and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the correlation between irAEs and efficacy in AGC patients treated with nivolumab.The subjects of this study were AGC patients received nivolumab monotherapy between January 2015 and August 2018. IrAEs were defined as those AEs having a potential immunological basis that required close follow-up, or immunosuppressive therapy and/or endocrine therapy. We divided the patients who received nivolumab into two groups based on occurrence of irAEs; those with irAEs (irAE group) or those without (non-irAE group). We assessed the efficacy in both groups.Of the 65 AGC patients that received nivolumab monotherapy, 14 developed irAEs. The median time to onset of irAEs was 30. days (range 3-407 days). Median follow-up period for survivors was 32 months (95% CI, 10.8 to 34.). The median progression-free survival was 7. months (95% CI, 3.6 to 11.) in the irAE group and 1.4 months (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6) in the non-irAE group (HR = 0.11, p < 0.001). The median overall survival was 16.8 months (95% CI, 4.4 to not reached) in the irAE group and 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.2 to 4.1) in the non-irAE group (HR = 0.17, p < 0.001).

However, few studies have been conducted to investigate whether IN is effective even in treatment-refractory cases, such as in those with steroid dependency and anti-TNF refractoriness.In the INDIGO study, 86 patients with active UC were randomly assigned to an IN group (0.-2.0 g daily) or placebo group. The rate of clinical response (CR), mucosal healing (MH), and change in fecal calprotectin (FCP) levels was compared between refractory [patients with steroid-dependent disease, previous use of anti-TNF-α, and concomitant use of immunomodulators (IM)] and non-refractory patients. We also analyzed factors predicting CR and MH at week 8.The rates of CR of IN group were significantly higher than placebo group, even in patients with steroid-dependent disease (p < 0.001), previous use of anti-TNF-α (p = 0.002), and concomitant use of IM (p = 0.013). The rates of MH in IN group were significantly higher than in placebo group in patients with steroid-dependent disease (p = 0.009). In the IN group, median FCP levels, at week 8, were significantly lower than baseline in patients with steroid-dependent disease and patients with the previous use of anti-TNF-α (p < 0.001, respectively).

Forty patients were randomized in two study arms, in which bowel purgation was performed either before or after PET-MR enterography. All patients underwent ileocolonoscopy with mucosal biopsies after PET-MR within 24 h. Diagnostic performance of MR morphological parameters (MRmorph), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and PET in detecting histological inflammation determined by the Nancy index was compared with each other and between study arms. Correlation between PET and histological inflammatory severity was calculated.In study arm without previous bowel purgation, SUV ratio of bowel segment (relative to SUV of the liver) facilitated the highest specificity and diagnostic accuracy compared with MRmorph and DWI. Bowel cleansing led to markedly increased metabolic activity of bowel segments, resulting in significantly reduced specificity of PET compared with study arm without purgation (0.808 vs. 0.966, p = 0.007, respectively). Inter-observer concordance for assessing MRmorph was clearly increased after bowel cleansing (Cohen's κ, 0.847 vs. 0.665; p = 0.013, respectively), though diagnostic performance of MRmorph was not significantly improved. Our findings suggested that the change of metabolic status was mainly associated with the grade of neutrophil infiltrate and less dependent on chronic infiltrate.PET-MR enterography was an excellent non-invasive diagnostic method in the assessment of histological active inflammation in ulcerative  without the need of previous bowel purgation.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31549273>Bismuth(III) interactions with Desulfovibrio desulfuricans: inhibition of cell energetics and nanocrystal formation of BiS and Bi.</a></h1><p>Sulfate-reducing bacteria have been suggested to have an etiological role in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases and ulcerative  in humans. Traditionally. bismuth compounds have been administered to alleviate gastrointestinal discomfort and disease symptoms. One mechanism by which this treatment occurs is through binding bacterial derived hydrogen sulfide in the intestines. With the addition of bismuth-deferiprone, bismuth-citrate and bismuth subsalicylate to reactions containing cells of D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774, the oxidation of H with sulfate as the electron acceptor was inhibited but H oxidation with nitrate, nitrite and sulfite was not reduced. Our research suggests that a target for bismuth inhibition of D. desulfuricans is the F subunit of the ATP synthase and, thus, dissimilatory sulfate reduction does not occur. At sublethal concentrations, bismuth as Bi(III) is precipitated by hydrogen sulfide produced from respiratory sulfate reduction by D. desulfuricans. Nanocrystals of bismuth sulfide were determined to be BiS through the use of high resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging with X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis. In the absence of sulfate, D. desulfuricans oxidizes H with the reduction of Bi(III) to Bi and this was also established by X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634546>Leukocyte-specific siRNA delivery revealing IRF8 as a potential anti-inflammatory target.</a></h1><p>Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) protein plays a critical role in the differentiation, polarization, and activation of mononuclear phagocytic cells. In light of previous studies, we explored the therapeutic potential of IRF8 inhibition as immunomodulatory therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To this end, we utilized siRNA-loaded lipid-based nanoparticles (siLNPs) and demonstrated a ∼90% reduction of IRF8 mRNA levels in vitro (PV < 0.0001), alongside a notable reduction in IRF8 protein. Moreover, silencing IRF8 ex vivo in splenocytes lead to a profound downregulation of IRF8 protein, followed by an immunomodulatory effect, as represented by a decrease in the secretion of TNFα, IL6 and IL12/IL23 (IL12p40) proinflammatory cytokines (PV = 0.0045, 0.0330, <0.0001, respectively). In order to silence IRF8 in vivo, selectively in inflammatory leukocytes, we used siLNPs that were coated with anti-Ly6C antibodies via our recently published ASSET targeting approach. Through this strategy, we have demonstrated a selective binding of the targeted-LNPs (T-LNPs) to Ly6C + inflammatory leukocytes. Finally, an immunomodulatory effect was demonstrated in vivo in an IBD mouse model with a profound decrease of TNFα, IL6, IL12/IL23, and IL1β pro-inflammatory cytokines (n = , PV < 0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.02, respectively) and an improvement of colon-morphology as assessed by colon-length measurements and colonoscopy (PV < 0.0001). Overall, using antibody-targeted siLNPs, we showed a notable reduction of IRF8 mRNA and protein and demonstrated a targeted immunomodulation therapeutic effect ex vivo and in vivo, in the DSS  model. We claim that a selective silencing of IRF8 in inflammatory leukocytes (such as Ly6C+) may serve as a therapeutic approach for treating inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Methods Eleven patients hospitalized in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2006 to December 2017 for treatment of UC,suffering from acute massive LGIB,were enrolled and descriptively analyzed. Results The proportion of UC patients with acute massive LGIB was 0.7% among all 1486 UC patients hospitalized during the study period.The disease was moderately or severely active in these 11 patients,among whom 9 patients(81.8%)had chronic relapsing pancolitis.Cytomegalovirus infection was present in  patients,among whom 4 patients received antiviral treatments.All the 11 patients received treatments including food and water fasting,rehydration,blood transfusion,and use of somatostatin.Four patients received emergency surgical treatment after the first episode of massive bleeding,and 3 of them suffered from re-bleeding after the surgery.Among the remaining seven patients,two underwent emergency total colectomy+subtotal rectectomy+ileostomy and three received elective total resection of colon and rectum or total colectomy+subtotal rectectomy+ileostomy.Thus,9 patients underwent emergency surgery,1 patient did not receive surgey during follow-up,and 1 patient was lost to follow-up.

Limited literature exists regarding SILS total/subtotal colectomies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Aim of the study was to present the initial experience with this type of approach in a district general hospital and extrapolate its feasibility and safety in this specific context based on gold standard outcomes reported in literature.  Preoperative parameters, operative details and surgical outcomes of consecutive patients who underwent colonic SILS for IBD in a -year period were reviewed retrospectively. Median length of follow-up was 26 months.  Fourteen patients underwent SILS subtotal/total colectomy. Median body mass index was 25 (18.1-35). Two patients had previous abdominal surgeries. Median operating time was 202. minutes. Two cases were converted to open. Median length of stay was  days. Three patients presented complications. Three patients developed parastomal hernias (21.4%). Five out of 12 patients with ulcerative  declined further surgery, 3 are awaiting laparoscopic/SILS pouch formation, 1 underwent SILS pouch formation, 1 SILS ileo-rectal anastomosis and 1 patient had SILS completion proctectomy. One patient was not followed up.  Despite literature data heterogeneity, these results provide support to the feasibility and applicability of SILS in the subgroup of patients who undergo subtotal/total colectomies for IBD, offering the option for subsequent SILS completion or restorative procedures. Further studies are required to explore the benefit of SILS over MLS (including cosmesis and quality of life) and non-inferiority of SILS regarding the parastomal hernia issue and the operative duration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526273>Plasma calprotectin is superior to serum calprotectin as a biomarker of intestinal inflammation in ulcerative .</a></h1><p> Despite promising results, only a few studies have been published on serum calprotectin as a biomarker in IBD. Recently, plasma measurements of calprotectin have been shown to be more reliable than serum measurements. In this study, we aim to assess plasma and serum calprotectin measurements as biomarkers of disease activity in paediatric and adult ulcerative .  Paediatric (-18 years) and adult (>18 years) patients scheduled for colonoscopy due to suspected or confirmed ulcerative  were included prospectively. Stool and blood samples were collected at time of colonoscopy and patient symptom scores were recorded. At colonoscopy the Ulcerative  Endoscopic Index of Severity was recorded. Histology was graded according to the Geboes score.  84 patients where included; 30 paediatric and 54 adult patients. Plasma calprotectin had a stronger correlation to all outcome variables than serum calprotectin. Plasma calprotectin correlated positively to disease extent ( = 0.53,  < .0001), symptoms scores ( = 0.54,  = .002, only in the paediatric cohort), endoscopic scores ( = 0.39,  = .0003), histological scores (Rho 0.28,  = .01) and, when using endoscopic assessment of severity as reference, could discriminate active disease from patients in remission ( = .03).  While more studies are needed to assess if plasma calprotectin can discriminate healthy individuals from ulcerative , this study indicates that plasma calprotectin can be used as a biomarker of disease activity, especially in cases where faecal calprotectin measurements are cumbersome either due to patient compliance or logistical requirements.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553834>Vedolizumab versus Adalimumab for Moderate-to-Severe Ulcerative .</a></h1><p>Biologic therapies are widely used in patients with ulcerative . Head-to-head trials of these therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are lacking.In a phase 3b, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial conducted at 245 centers in 34 countries, we compared vedolizumab with adalimumab in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative  to determine whether vedolizumab was superior. Previous exposure to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor other than adalimumab was allowed in up to 25% of patients. The patients were assigned to receive infusions of 300 mg of vedolizumab on day 1 and at weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46 (plus injections of placebo) or subcutaneous injections of 40 mg of adalimumab, with a total dose of 160 mg at week 1, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg every 2 weeks thereafter until week 50 (plus infusions of placebo). Dose escalation was not permitted in either group. The primary outcome was clinical remission at week 52 (defined as a total score of ≤2 on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components). To control for type I error, efficacy outcomes were analyzed with a hierarchical testing procedure, with the variables in the following order: clinical remission, endoscopic improvement (subscore of 0 to 1 on the Mayo endoscopic component), and corticosteroid-free remission at week 52.A total of 769 patients underwent randomization and received at least one dose of vedolizumab (383 patients) or adalimumab (386 patients). At week 52, clinical remission was observed in a higher percentage of patients in the vedolizumab group than in the adalimumab group (31.3% vs. 22.%; difference, 8.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2. to 15.0; P = 0.006), as was endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs. 27.7%; difference, 11.9 percentage points; 95% CI, .3 to 18.; P<0.001). Corticosteroid-free clinical remission occurred in 12.6% of the patients in the vedolizumab group and in 21.8% in the adalimumab group (difference, -9.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -18.9 to 0.4). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of infection were 23.4 and 34.6 events per 100 patient-years with vedolizumab and adalimumab, respectively, and the corresponding rates for serious infection were 1.6 and 2.2 events per 100 patient-years.In this trial involving patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative , vedolizumab was superior to adalimumab with respect to achievement of clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, but not corticosteroid-free clinical remission.

Data on the effects of continuing -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) treatment in patients who commence on biologics as maintenance treatment remain scarce. We evaluated IBD patient outcomes after continuation/discontinuation of -ASA when biologics were administered as maintenance treatment.We retrospectively reviewed the clinical, laboratory, and imaging data of patients diagnosed with IBD (ulcerative  (UC), 763; Crohn's disease (CD), 537) in the Gil Medical Center (GMC) from February 2005 to June 2018. We divided patients administered with biologics as maintenance treatment into those who did and did not continue on -ASA and compared the efficacies of the two treatment options using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models.Of 1300 total IBD patients, 128 (UC, 63; CD, 65) were prescribed biologics as induction and maintenance treatments. The median follow-up period was 109. weeks. All cases were divided into those who did or did not combine -ASA with biologics as maintenance treatments. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the event-free survival (exacerbation of disease activity) of UC patients treated with biologics and -ASA (n = 42) was not significantly lower than that of those taking biologics alone (n = 21) (log rank test, P = 0.68). The same was true of CD patients (n = 42, biologics and -ASA; n = 23, biologics only) (log rank test, P = 0.87).Continuation of -ASA after initiation of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha agents did not improve prognosis in Korean IBD patients compared with that of those who discontinued -ASA during maintenance treatment, particularly in patients who experienced more than two disease aggravations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593973>Changes in Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding Presentation, Management, and Outcomes Over a 10-Year Span.</a></h1><p>There are only limited data available on changes in the etiology, management, and clinical outcomes in patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding over the past decade.We compared 2 groups of consecutive patients hospitalized with lower gastrointestinal bleeding during 2 time periods: 2005 to 2007 (301 patients) and 2015 to 2017 (249 patients).Compared with the 2005 to 2007 group, the mean Charlson comorbidity index in the 2015 to 2017 group was higher (.0±2.6 vs. 6.0±3.0, P=0.028), whereas the use of computerized tomographic angiography and small bowel capsule endoscopy was more common (12.9% vs. 58.1%, P<0.001, and 28.8% vs. 69.0%, P=0.031, respectively). In 2005 to 2007, ischemic  (12.0%) was the most common confirmed etiology of bleeding and diverticular bleeding the second most common (8.6%), whereas in 2015 to 2017, diverticular bleeding was the most common etiology (10.4%), followed by angiodysplasia (8.4%). Small bowel bleeding sources were confirmed more often in the 2015 to 2017 group (P=0.017). Endoscopic treatment was attempted in 16.6% of patients in 2005 to 2007 versus 25.3% in 2015 to 2017 (P=0.015).

This study aimed to examine the use of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) in mitigating damages caused by UC on the colon epithelium. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC mice were treated with vehicle control, TRF, alpha-tocopherol (αTP) and -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA). Observable clinical signs, quality of stool, histopathological scoring, inflammatory and oxidative markers were assessed. Vitamin E levels of colons and plasma were quantified. Oral supplementation of TRF significantly reduced the severity of DSS-induced UC by lowering the disease activity index (DAI) and histopathological inflammatory scoring. TRF also attenuated the DSS-induced enlargement of spleen and shortening of the colon. TRF has demonstrated marked anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties indicated by the attenuation of DSS-induced upregulation of inflammation and oxidative stress markers including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, myeloperoxidase (MPO), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and pNF-κB. These improvements were similar to that of -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) treatment. In contrast, αTP did not demonstrate evident clinical and histopathological improvements. The superior protective effect of TRF may be ascribed to the preferential absorption of TRF by the gut mucosa. TRF alleviated the signs and symptoms of acute UC in murine model via the reduction of local inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress. These effects suggested that TRF could serve as a gut health supplement for preventive measures for UC condition in patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562236>British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative  and Crohn's disease are the principal forms of inflammatory bowel disease. Both represent chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which displays heterogeneity in inflammatory and symptomatic burden between patients and within individuals over time. Optimal management relies on understanding and tailoring evidence-based interventions by clinicians in partnership with patients. This guideline for management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults over 16 years of age was developed by Stakeholders representing UK physicians (British Society of Gastroenterology), surgeons (Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland), specialist nurses (Royal College of Nursing), paediatricians (British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition), dietitians (British Dietetic Association), radiologists (British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology), general practitioners (Primary Care Society for Gastroenterology) and patients (Crohn's and  UK). A systematic review of 88 247 publications and a Delphi consensus process involving 81 multidisciplinary clinicians and patients was undertaken to develop 168 evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations for pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical interventions, as well as optimal service delivery in the management of both ulcerative  and Crohn's disease. Comprehensive up-to-date guidance is provided regarding indications for, initiation and monitoring of immunosuppressive therapies, nutrition interventions, pre-, peri- and postoperative management, as well as structure and function of the multidisciplinary team and integration between primary and secondary care. Twenty research priorities to inform future clinical management are presented, alongside objective measurement of priority importance, determined by 2379 electronic survey responses from individuals living with ulcerative  and Crohn's disease, including patients, their families and friends.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

It was found that treatment with JGT or -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) alleviated the severity of  symptoms by suppressing inflammatory cytokine levels of IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ. The non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis of gut microbiome revealed that JGT groups were clearly separated from the DSS group, suggesting that JGT administration altered gut microbiota. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were decreased by DSS but increased by JGT include  and . On the other hand, OTUs that were increased by DSS but decreased by -ASA or JGT treatments include Bacteroidales S24-7, Ruminococcaceae, and Rikenellaceae, and the genera , , , and . After JGT administration, the metabolites, including most amino acids and lactic acid that were altered by  induction, became similar to those of the control group.

We used bivariate and multivariable analyses to identify predictors of inadequate response to budesonide MMX.Ninety-six patients were treated with budesonide MMX. Before initiation of budesonide MMX 55, 35, and 8% were on aminosalicylate, immunomodulator, and/or biologic therapy or no therapy for UC respectively. While 54% (52/96) of patients responded to budesonide MMX, 46% (44/96) required a transition to prednisone. Patients who required transition to prednisone were more likely to be male (39 vs. 19%,  = 0.035) and younger at the time of diagnosis (median age 23. vs. 29.0 years,  = 0.034). Age ≤29 years at diagnosis (adjusted OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.21-7.95) and male sex (adjusted OR 2.96, 95% CI 1.12-7.77) but not concomitant therapy with biologics and/or immunomodulators or disease extent were associated with increased odds of requiring transition to prednisone.Budesonide MMX is effective in more than half of patients with mild-to-moderate UC. Predictors of budesonide non-response and need to transition to prednisone include male sex and younger age at diagnosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575772>Increased Epithelial Oxygenation Links  to an Expansion of Tumorigenic Bacteria.</a></h1><p>Intestinal inflammation is a risk factor for colorectal cancer formation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.

An aerobic expansion of colibactin-producing  was required for the cancer-inducing activity of this pathobiont in a mouse model of -associated colorectal cancer formation. We conclude that increased epithelial oxygenation in the colon is associated with an expansion of a prooncogenic driver species, thereby increasing the cancer-inducing activity of the microbiota. One of the environmental factors important for colorectal cancer formation is the gut microbiota, but the habitat filters that control its cancer-inducing activity remain unknown. Here, we show that chemically induced  elevates epithelial oxygenation in the colon, thereby driving an expansion of colibactin-producing , a prooncogenic driver species. These data suggest that elevated epithelial oxygenation is a potential risk factor for colorectal cancer formation because the consequent changes in the gut habitat escalate the cancer-inducing activity of the microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Cevallos et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559298>Fecal microbiota transplantation as an effective initial therapy for pancreatitis complicated with severe  infection: A case report.</a></h1><p>Moderately severe acute pancreatitis (MSAP) is a critical form of acute pancreatitis that is related with high morbidity and mortality. Severe  infection (sCDI) is a serious and rare nosocomial diarrheal complication, especially in MSAP patients. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for refractory and recurrent CDI (rCDI). However, knowledge regarding the initial use of FMT in patients suffering from sCDI is limited.Here, we report an MSAP patient complicated with sCDI who was treated by FMT as a first-line therapy. The patient was a 51-year-old man who suffered from diarrhea in his course of acute pancreatitis. An enzyme immunoassay was performed to detect toxins, and the result was positive for toxin-producing  and toxin B and negative for  ribotype 027. The colonoscopy revealed pseudomembranous . Due to these findings, sCDI was our primary consideration. Because the patient provided informed consent for FMT treatment, we initially treated the patient by FMT rather than metronidazole. Diarrhea resolved within  d after FMT. The patient remained asymptomatic, and the follow-up colonoscopy performed 40 d after discharge showed a complete recovery. Our case is the first reported in China.This case explores the possibilities of initially using FMT to treat severe CDI. Moreover, FMT may become a critical component of the treatment for severe CDI in MSAP patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487725>Functional Outcomes and Quality of Life in Elderly Patients after Restorative Proctocolectomy for Ulcerative .</a></h1><p>Ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) has become the surgical procedure of choice for patients with ulcerative  (UC). However, to date few studies have examined functional outcomes or quality of life (QOL) in elderly patients after pouch construction.In December 2017, we sent questionnaires to 224 patients aged 65 years and older at the time who underwent an IPAA at our hospital between June 1987 and May 2015 regarding issues related to QOL and functional outcomes. Responders aged 65-69 years old were defined as the elderly group (EG), while those 70 years old and over comprised the super-EG (SEG).The response rate was 60.7% (136/224); 70 patients were classified as EG, and 66 were classified as SEG. The SEG were older at the time of the IPAA and during the follow-up period (p < 0.01). The stool frequency per day was 8 times in both groups (p = 0.21). There was no significant difference between the EG and SEG with regard to daytime (53 vs. 56%, p = 0.73) or nighttime (65.7 vs. 53%, p = 0.16) soiling. There was also no difference in the exacerbation of daytime or nighttime soiling compared to the first year after the operation (daytime .7 vs. 12.1%, p = 0.23; nighttime 7.1 vs. 9.1%, p = 0.76). QOL was evaluated using the modified fecal incontinence QOL (mFIQL) scale, with no significant difference between the EG and SEG (27 vs. 31 points). Since both groups had mFIQL scores <50, QOL was considered to be maintained.In our analysis of elderly patients in the long-term period following surgery for UC, some noted fecal soiling, though QOL was largely maintained, and there were no serious effects on daily life.© 2019 S.

Measures taken to avoid excess were assessed.Of 2385 patients, 28% received steroids in the preceding 12 months. 14.8% had steroid excess or dependency. Steroid use was significantly lower at 'intervention centres' which participated in a quality improvement programme (exposure: 23.8% vs 31.0%, P < .001; excess 11.% vs 17.1%, P < .001). At intervention centres, steroid use fell from 2015 to 2017 (steroid exposure 30.0%-23.8%, P = .003; steroid excess 13.8%-11.%, P = .17). Steroid excess was judged avoidable in 50.7%. Factors independently associated with reduced steroid excess in Crohn's disease included maintenance with anti-TNF agents (OR 0.61 [95% CI 0.24-0.95]), treatment in a centre with a multi-disciplinary team (OR 0.54 [95% CI 0.20-0.86]) and treatment at an intervention centre (OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.46-0.97]).

In the biologic era, it still remains the treatment of choice in mild-to-moderate UC. Positioning of this therapeutic class in moderate-to-severe UC is less clear. : Several studies demonstrated the ability of -ASA to induce endoscopic remission to a similar extent as anti-TNF therapy on the moderate segment of UC. Histologic remission is achieved after induction in up to 45% of patients treated with topical -ASA and 30% with oral formulations. Aminosalicylates offer a favorable safety profile compared to that of immunomodulators and biologics. High-dose -ASA therapy may be a valuable option for patients with moderately active disease, and physicians should weigh the pros and cons of this strategy in selected patients. Whether aminosalicylates should be continued in combination with thiopurines or biologic therapy remains under debate. : In the era of biologics, aminosalicylates remain the first-line therapy in patients with mild UC, and have to be considered in case of moderate UC, given their favorable risk-benefit profile. We suggest that -ASA should be used in moderate patients without poor prognostic factors, while biologics should be preferred otherwise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624383>[Pediatric colonoscopy findings and changing patterns from Beijing in one institutional experience over 12 years].</a></h1><p>To investigate the demographics and diagnostic yield in a cohort of Chinese pediatric patients undergoing colonoscopy in one institution over 12 years.The study participants were consecutive patients aged <18 years that underwent their first colonoscopy in the endoscopy center at Peking University Third Hospital between Jan. 1, 2005 and Dec. 31, 2017.

Patients were randomly assigned to groups given intravenous placebo (n=63), mirikizumab 50 mg (n=63) or 200 mg (n=62) with exposure-based dosing, or mirikizumab 60 mg with fixed dosing (n=61), at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Of assigned patients, 63% had prior exposure to a biologic agent. Clinical responders (decrease in 9-point Mayo score, including ≥2 points and ≥35% from baseline with either a decrease of rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1) at week 12 who had received mirikizumab were randomly assigned to groups that received maintenance treatment with mirikizumab 200 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks (n=47) or every 12 weeks (n=46). The primary endpoint was clinical remission (Mayo subscores of 0 for rectal bleeding, with 1-point decrease from baseline for stool frequency, and 0 or 1 for endoscopy) at week 12. A multiple testing procedure was used that began with the 600-mg dose group, and any non-significant comparison result ended the formal statistical testing procedure.At week 12, 15.9% (P=.066), 22.6% (P=.004), and 11.% (P=.142) of patients in the 50-mg, 200-mg, and 600-mg groups achieved clinical remission, respectively, compared with 4.8% of patients given placebo. The primary endpoint was not significant (comparison to 600 mg, P>.05). Clinical responses occurred in 41.3% (P=.014), 59.7% (P<.001), and 49.2% (P=.001) of patients in the 50-mg, 200-mg, and 600-mg groups, respectively, compared to 20.6% of patients given placebo. At week 52, 46.8% of patients given subcutaneous mirikizumab 200 mg every 4 weeks and 37.0% given subcutaneous mirikizumab 200 mg every 12 weeks were in clinical remission.In a randomized trial of patients with UC, mirikizumab was effective in inducing a clinical response after 12 weeks. Additional studies are required to determine the optimal dose for induction of remission. Mirikizumab demonstrated durable efficacy throughout the maintenance period.

Endoscopy is often inconspicuous, and the diagnosis relies on histopathological assessment of colonic biopsies. Digital Image Analysis (DIA) eliminates interobserver variation. The aim of this study was to establish digital cutoff values for LC and LCi on CD3 stained slides.One hundred and six patients with a hematoxylin and eosin (HE) diagnosis of normal colonic mucosa (N = 19), non-specific reactive changes (N = 24), LCi (N = 23) and LC (N = 40) were eligible for analysis. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) reached by DIA in the total surface epithelium and in hot spots of the biopsies was compared with the diagnostic category assigned by the pathologists based on HE stained slides. The digitalized slides were analyzed for number of IELs using Visiopharm Quantitative Digital Pathology software. All digitalized slides were examined manually to identify differences in the approach to the evaluation of the biopsies by the pathologists and DIA.The median IEL counts and interquartile range in the total surface epithelium were 3.6 (3.2-4.3), 4.4 (3.4-.3), 19.8 (16.6-30.0) and 41.3 (37.0-47.8) in normal colon mucosa, mucosa with non-specific reactive changes, LCi and LC, respectively. Discrimination between normal mucosa and non-specific reactive changes was not possible. Digital cutoff values with the best separation between non-LC, LCi and LC were > 13 IELs/100 epithelial cells for LCi and > 36 IELs/100 epithelial cells for LC. These cutoff values resulted in an agreement between the pathologist's and DIA that was very good with a kappa value of 0.90.Despite differences among the approach of DIA and the pathologist's assessment of IELs in colonic mucosa DIA is able discriminate between the HE based diagnoses of the three subgroups non-LC, LCi and LC with high accuracy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Antibiotics represent the mainstay of treatment, suggesting a crucial role of dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of this condition. Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents have been shown to adversely impact the gut microbiome and local host immunity.The aim of this study is to assess the effect of prior exposure to biologics on the development of pouchitis in patients who have ulcerative .This is a retrospective case-control study.This study was conducted at a tertiary-care IBD center.Consecutive patients with ulcerative  who underwent restorative proctocolectomy between 2000 and 2010 were included.The primary outcome measured was the incidence of pouchitis.Four hundred seventeen patients with ulcerative  who underwent IPAA were included. The incidence of pouchitis was 40.4%. There were no differences in patient demographics, disease-specific factors, surgical approach, and short-term postoperative complications between patients who developed pouchitis compared to those that did not. Patients exposed to anti-tumor necrosis factor agents or preoperative steroids were significantly more likely to develop pouchitis (anti-tumor necrosis factor: 47.9% vs 36.%, p = 0.027; steroids: 41.7% vs 23.3%, p = 0.048). However, on multivariable analysis, only anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy was an independent predictor for pouchitis (p = 0.05). Pouchitis was not associated with adverse long-term outcomes.The retrospective design was a limitation of this study.In a large cohort of patients undergoing IPAA for ulcerative  with at least a -year follow-up, anti-tumor necrosis factor exposure was the only independent risk factor for the development of pouchitis.

Antibiotic therapy,especially that with anaerobic activity, has profound effects on the gut microbiome. Therefore, we sought to assess the effect of antibiotics on the development of IMDC.Patients who received ICI therapy from January 2016 to January 2018 were examined retrospectively. A Cox regression model was used to assess factors associated with overall survival.A total of 826 patients were included. Of these patients, 51.6% received inhibitors of programmed cell death protein-1 or its ligand, 32.0% received inhibitors of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4, and 16.% received a combination of the two. IMDC occurred in 52.% of the patients after a median of 8 weeks. Overall, 569 patients (68.9%) received antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic use at any time was associated with reduced IMDC occurrence and recurrence rates but also with frequent hospitalization and intensive care unit admission for IMDC as well as increased IMDC severity. Compared with patients who received antibiotic therapy only before ICI therapy initiation, those receiving it after ICI had a higher IMDC rate and more often needed immunosuppressive therapy and hospitalization for IMDC. Antibiotics with anaerobic activity were included in 51% of the antibiotic therapy regimens and were associated with increased immunosuppressant use, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission for IMDC, and severe IMDC grades. Forty-one patients received empiric prophylactic antibiotic therapy at IMDC onset. These patients more often needed immunosuppressive therapy, intravenous steroids, and infliximab/vedolizumab; had more frequent and longer hospitalization for IMDC and higher IMDC grades; and more frequently had IMDC recurrence than did patients who did not receive antibiotic therapy at the time of IMDC symptom onset.Whereas antibiotic therapy appeared to be protective against IMDC onset, use of antibiotics, especially those with anaerobic activity, after ICI therapy was associated with increased risk of severe IMDC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504363>Global prevalence and bidirectional association between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease - A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Epidemiological studies have established an association between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), i.e. ulcerative  (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) but results are inconsistent. The aim of this study was therefore to quantify the prevalence and association between IBD and psoriasis.PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched from database inception through April 2018 for studies reporting data on psoriasis among patients with IBD and vice versa. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate, respectively, the prevalence and association between IBD and psoriasis. Data extraction was according to the PRISMA guideline, and quality assessment was made using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The main outcomes were the proportion of psoriasis patients with IBD and vice versa, as well as the association (odds ratio [OR]) of IBD in psoriasis and psoriasis in IBD, respectively.Based on quantitative analysis of 93 studies, the prevalence of psoriasis in CD and UC was 3.6% (95% CI 3.1%-4.6%) and 2.8% (95% CI 2.0%-3.8%) respectively, while the prevalence of CD and UC was 0.7% (95% CI 0.2%-1.3%) and 0.% (95% CI 0.3%-0.8%), respectively, among patients with psoriasis. Presence of CD or UC was significantly associated with psoriasis given by OR=2.0 (95% CI 1.4-2.9) and OR=1. (95% CI 1.2-2.0), respectively. Presence of psoriasis was significantly associated with CD (OR=2.2, 95% CI 1.6-3.1) and UC (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.0).We found significant bidirectional associations between psoriasis and IBD warranting increased awareness among clinicians in the diagnostic process, especially in children and adolescents with IBD. Lastly, this study showed an increased frequency of paradoxical psoriasis in patients treated with biologics.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

However, the chemopreventive activity has not yet been elucidated in preclinical animal models. This study was designed to determine whether dietary tricin exerts inflammation-associated colon carcinogenesis induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. Male Crj: CD-1 mice were initiated with a single i.p. injection of AOM (10 mg/kg bw) and followed by a 1-week exposure to DSS (1.%, w/v) in drinking water to induce colonic neoplasms. They were then given the experimental diet containing 50 or 250 ppm tricin. The experiment was terminated at week 18 to determine the chemopreventive efficacy of tricin. The effects of dietary tricin on the expression of several inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, were also assayed. Feeding with tricin at both doses significantly inhibited the development of colonic tumors. Dietary tricin also significantly reduced the proliferation index and the numbers of mitoses/anaphase bridging of adenocarcinoma cells. Tricin feeding significantly suppressed the TNF-α expression in the normal appearing crypts. Our findings may suggest a potential use of tricin for clinical trials of colorectal cancer chemoprevention in the inflamed colon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461706>Therapeutic Drug Monitoring to Guide Clinical Decision Making in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients with Loss of Response to Anti-TNF: A Delphi Technique-Based Consensus.</a></h1><p>Loss of response is frequently encountered in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and antidrug antibody measurement are increasingly used in this setting.To establish a consensus on the use of TDM in the context of loss of response to anti-TNFs, we performed a vote using a Delphi-style process followed by an expert panel discussion among 8 IBD specialists practicing in Switzerland, Europe. Statements were rated on an even Likert-scale ranging from 1 (strong disagreement) to 4 (strong agreement), based on expert opinion and the available literature.The experts agreed on the following statements: (i) loss of response is associated with inadequate drug levels in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative ; (ii) best timepoint for measuring drug levels is prior to the next application (= trough levels) with different thresholds for anti-TNF agents (infliximab  μg/mL, adalimumab 8 μg/mL, certolizumab pegol 10 μg/mL); (iii) antidrug antibodies are predictive for loss of response; and (iv) antidrug-antibody titers and drug trough levels are key determinants in the treatment algorithm. Data about non-anti-TNF biologics were considered too limited to propose recommendations.A Delphi-style consensus among 8 IBD experts shows that TDM and measurement of antidrug-antibody titers are useful in the context of loss of response to anti-TNF. Optimal cutoff levels depend on the type of anti-TNF. These values are critical in the decision making process. More studies are needed to address the value of such measurements for non-anti-TNF biologics.© 2019 S.

Thirty-day complications were observed in  patients (n = 4 urinary retention, 1 perianal abscess). Five patients with Crohn's disease eventually required proctectomy at a median of 7 years after skin tag excision (range, 6 months to 10 years), but none were secondary to impaired wound healing. Two patients with ulcerative  who had previously undergone IPAA were subsequently diagnosed with Crohn's disease of the pouch after skin tag excision. No other long-term complications were seen in patients with ulcerative .The study's retrospective design does not allow identification of patients with IBD who underwent only medical management of their hemorrhoids. There is also selection bias in which patients were selected for interventional management of their disease.The requirement for proctectomy after hemorrhoidectomy/skin tag excision appears to be secondary to the natural disease course of perianal Crohn's disease rather than perianal intervention. Selective hemorrhoidectomy and skin tag excision in patients with well-controlled luminal disease should be considered.

The treat-to-target strategy, emphasizing proactive assessment and optimizing treatment, is commonly applied in the clinical setting. Although colonoscopies are essential for this strategy to be successful, bowel preparation and sedative drugs are required for paediatric patients. We attempted to verify the usefulness of sigmoidoscopy, which is less invasive than colonoscopy, combined with faecal calprotectin, to assess mucosal healing.A total of 58 paediatric patients diagnosed with ulcerative  and followed up at Severance Children's Hospital from March 2015 to May 2018 were enrolled. Clinical data and laboratory findings (including faecal calprotectin and endoscopic data) were collected from medical records. The predictive power of mucosal healing of sigmoid colon and rectum (s-MH) combined with faecal calprotectin to predict mucosal healing throughout the colon was analysed.Among 58 patients (mean age 16.13 ± 2.88 years), 18 (31.0%) were in mucosal healing status. The median faecal calprotectin level was 486. μg/g. The faecal calprotectin cutoff value for predicting mucosal healing, identified using receiver-operating characteristic analyses, was 148 μg/g (area under the curve, 0.81). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of s-MH in predicting mucosal healing were 1.0, 0.82, 0.72, and 1.0, respectively. When we combined s-MH with faecal calprotectin less than the cutoff value, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.56, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.83, respectively.For patients with a low faecal calprotectin level, sigmoidoscopy might be sufficient to assess mucosal healing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581545>Preclinical Study in Vivo for New Pharmacological Approaches in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review of Chronic Model of TNBS-Induced .</a></h1><p>The preclinical studies in vivo provide means of characterizing physiologic interactions when our understanding of such processes is insufficient to allow replacement with in vitro systems and play a pivotal role in the development of a novel therapeutic drug cure. Chemically induced  models are relatively easy and rapid to develop. The 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)  model is one of the main models in the experimental studies of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) since inflammation induced by TNBS mimics several features of Crohn's disease. This review aims to summarize the existing literature and discuss different protocols for the induction of chronic model of TNBS-induced .

There are no studies on long-term outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for UC-associated neoplasia (UCAN). We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of ESD for UC-associated dysplasia (UCAD) during long-term follow-up.We retrospectively enrolled 17 consecutive UC patients with 22 UCADs, who underwent initial ESD or total proctocolectomy at the Hiroshima University Hospital. The clinicopathological features of the patients and neoplasias and clinical outcomes of ESD were evaluated and compared with those of total proctocolectomy.UCAD in the ESD and total proctocolectomy groups was mostly noted on the left side of the colon, and most lesions were superficial macroscopic lesions. In the ESD group, en bloc resection and histological complete resection rates were 83 and 67%, respectively. One patient died of malignant melanoma; however, none of the patients died of UC-associated carcinoma in both groups. Metachronous neoplasias developed in  of the 7 patients in the ESD group. Among the  patients with metachronous UCAN, 4 finally underwent total proctocolectomy and 1 underwent additional ESD.ESD for UCAD is a useful method for total excisional biopsy.

A total of 961 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous induction dose of ustekinumab (either 130 mg [320 patients] or a weight-range-based dose that approximated 6 mg per kilogram of body weight [322]) or placebo (319). Patients who had a response to induction therapy 8 weeks after administration of intravenous ustekinumab were randomly assigned again to receive subcutaneous maintenance injections of 90 mg of ustekinumab (either every 12 weeks [172 patients] or every 8 weeks [176]) or placebo (175). The primary end point in the induction trial (week 8) and the maintenance trial (week 44) was clinical remission (defined as a total score of ≤2 on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components).The percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 8 among patients who received intravenous ustekinumab at a dose of 130 mg (15.6%) or 6 mg per kilogram (15.%) was significantly higher than that among patients who received placebo (.3%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons).

We detected the expression of circ-SOD2 in Caco2 and NCM460 cells after being treated with inflammatory factors (LPS, TNF-α, IL1-β). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to determine the cellular location of circ-SOD2 in the UC colorectal mucosal tissues. The circ-SOD2 overexpression vector was constructed and produced and then transfected into Caco2 cells to examine the cells' trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), permeability of FITC-dextran and the alterations of epithelial barrier related molecules.We found 264 circRNAs (111 increased and 153 decreased) differentially expressed in the inflamed colon mucosa compared with normal colon mucosa using a P-value <0.05 and a >1.-fold change cutoff. To validate the circRNA microarray results, we selected some circRNAs to perform qRT-PCR based on the following criteria: (1) circRNAs raw data >100 in each sample, (2) fold-change >2, (3) P<0.05. We identified 10 dysregulated circRNA, among them, circ-SOD2 was upregulated with maximum fold-change in the UC inflamed colorectal mucosa tissues. Then we identified circ-SOD2 was upregulated significantly through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in expanded 30 paired colorectal mucosa tissues(P<0.001). After treatments with LPS, TNF-α and IL1-β, circ-SOD2 was upregulated in Caco2 and NCM460 cells at different points from 1 to 7 h. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated that circ-SOD2 located in intestinal epithelium mostly and few in mesenchyme and inflammatory cells. The overexpression of circ-SOD2 in Caco2 cells resulted in a decrease of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), an increase of the FITC-dextran permeability and the downregulation of epithelial barrier related molecule CLDN-8 (P<0.05).The dysregulation of circRNAs existed in UC inflamed colorectal mucosa, among which, the upregulated circ-SOD2 weakened the intestinal epithelial barrier and thus might promote the occurrence of ulcerative .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671425>A Polymorphism in Interleukin-1β Gene Is Associated with the Development of Pouchitis in Japanese Patients with Ulcerative .</a></h1><p>Major complications in patients with ulcerative  (UC) include UC-associated cancer (UCAC) and postoperative pouchitis. We aimed to identify SNPs associated with UCAC/high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and pouchitis.Patients with UC who underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) with >2 years of follow-up after functioning pouches were included. Pouchoscopies were performed at least once to diagnose pouchitis according to the modified pouchitis disease activity index. SNP genotyping was performed for 8 SNPs reportedly associated with UCAC and pouchitis, namely: ELF1 (rs7329174), FCGR2A, (rs1801274), interleukin-1β (IL-1B; rs1143627), ITLN1 (rs2274910), MHC (rs7765379), TNFα (rs1799964), TNFSF15 (rs3810936), and UHMK1 (rs768910), using TaqMan genotyping technologies. We investigated the association of these SNPs with UCAC/HGD and pouchitis. Patients' background data were retrospectively collected, including the presence of preoperative extraintestinal manifestation (EIM).A total of 91 Japanese patients with UC were included. None of the 8 SNPs were associated with UCAC/HGD in our cohort. Multivariable analyses proved that the presence of preoperative EIM (hazard ratio [HR] 3.313, 95% CI 1.325-8.289) and IL-1B (rs1143627) TT genotype (HR 2.425, 95% CI 1.049-.61) were independent predictive factors for the development of overall pouchitis.

We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients (age 18-64) with UC in the United States to examine time trends for colectomy and biologic use from 2007 to 2016.We estimated quarterly rates for colectomy and biologic use using the IQVIA Legacy PharMetrics Adjudicated Claims Database. We used interrupted time series methods with segmented regression to assess time trends with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for biologic use and colectomy before and after the emergence of newly available biologic therapies in 2014.Among 93,930 patients with UC, 2275 (2.4%) underwent colectomy from 2007 to 2016. Biologic use rates increased significantly from 2007 to 2016, from 131 per 1000 person-years in 2007 (95% CI, 121 to 140) to 589 per 1000 person-years in 2016 (95% CI, 575 to 604; P < 0.001). Colectomy rates decreased significantly between 2007 and 2016, from 7.8 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 7.4 to 8.2) to 4.2 per 1000 person-years in 2016 (95% CI, 3.2 to .1; P < 0.001). An interruption in 2014 was associated with a positive trend deflection for biologic use (+72 treatments per 1000 person-years per year (95% CI, 61 to 83) and a negative trend deflection for colectomy (-0.76 per 1000 person-years per year; 95% CI, -1.47 to -0.05).Among commercially insured patients in the United States from 2007 to 2016, biologic use rates increased, colectomy rates decreased, and both trends were impacted by the interruption in 2014. These findings suggest that new biologic therapies may have contributed to decreased colectomy rates.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The study parameters included SC, fecal calprotectin (FC) and conventional blood test parameters. Clinical indices (Harvey and Walmsley) and relevant endoscopic scores were completed for each scenario (Simple Endoscopic Score Crohn Disease [SES-CD] and Mayo).fifty-three patients were included in the study, 51% (27 patients) with ulcerative  (UC) and 49% (26 patients) with Crohn's disease (CD). The CS values in UC were significantly higher with an endoscopic Mayo score 2/3 (median score 10.39 mg/ml [IQR: 7.4-12.2]) compared to those with a Mayo score of 0/1 (median 4.07 mg/ml [IQR: 2.9-7.2]) (p = 0.01). The area under the ROC curve (AUCROC) was 0.85 and the sensitivity and specificity were 83.3% and 81.25%, respectively, for a SC cut-off point of 4.4 mg/dl. Furthermore, a higher AUCROC was obtained in comparison with other serological markers for activity (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], hemoglobin [Hb] and platelets). There were no statistically significant differences in the comparison between SC and endoscopic findings in CD (SES CD > 3: 20.1 [IQR: 16.8-23.4] vs SESC ≤ 3:6.25 [IQR: .4-7.1]) (p = 0.8).SC is a good indirect marker of inflammatory activity and there was a correlation with endoscopic findings in UC.

While clinical prediction tools exist, they do not incorporate the newest Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.This was a prospective longitudinal study of patients experiencing their first episode of uncomplicated CDI. Patients were followed from diagnosis through 8 weeks post-completion of their anti-CDI therapy to assess recurrence. Stool was collected at diagnosis and weekly for 8 weeks following treatment. Recurrence was defined as diarrhea as well as a positive stool test by toxin EIA (EIA) for C. difficile. Fisher's exact test for binary variables and Student's t test for continuous variables were performed. Cox regression was performed to assess for predictors of CDI recurrence.Seventy-five patients were enrolled between August 1, 2015, and September 1, 2018. Mean age 58.1 years ± 15., 69.3% female, 74.7% were white, 11.3% had baseline irritable bowel syndrome, and 54.7% were actively using PPIs. Over the 8-week follow-up period, 22 patients developed a confirmed CDI recurrence. Univariate predictors of recurrence included treatment with metronidazole (40.9% vs 15.1%, p = 0.03), initially diagnosis by EIA (77.3% vs 43.4%, p = 0.007) and platelet count (206 ± 72.1 vs 270.9 ± 114.8, p = 0.03).

However, more and more adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with PPIs are described.To determine the level of knowledge and attitude of GPs with respect to the ADRs of PPIs in adults.The GPs of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region and the chief residents or former chief residents of the 35 French university departments of general medicine were questioned online using a list of 12 ADRs based on a semi-systematic literature review (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypomagnesemia, increased liver enzymes, renal failure, pneumonitis, skin reactions, fracture, gastric polyps, microscopic , Clostridium difficile ) and their attitude towards these ADRs.Out of the 232 (7.%) GPs who participated, 38.4% had come across PPI ADRs (mainly digestive) in the last 6 months. These ADRs had been reported to pharmacovigilance in only 2.3% of the cases. No ADR at all was known by more than 70% of the GPs. The attitude of the GPs who had identified them was, in the majority, to stop PPI treatement. No difference in knowledge was found between university supervisors and non-supervisors. Finally, 74.7% of GPs declared that they required more information on IPP ADRs and 80.4% were willing to "deprescribe" these drugs.Aside from digestive ADRs, GPs have a poor knowledge of IPP-related ADRs. Those who do know them have an appropriate attitude and interrupt IPP treatment. The information requested by the GPs about the risks of PPIs is pertinent, particularly in a PPI-adapted prescription procedure, which also involves knowing how to "deprescribe".Copyright © 2019 Société française de pharmacologie et de thérapeutique.

We recorded data on GMA sessions, demographic characteristics, and clinical response. Effectiveness was assessed 1 and 6 months after finishing the GMA using the partial Mayo score, C-reactive protein, and fecal calprotectin levels. Data were also compiled on VDZ intensification, use of new immunomodulators and colectomy during follow-up.Eight patients were included (mean age 46 years; 63% female; mean disease duration, 132 months; 50% E3). GMA was started after a loss of response to VDZ in all cases (25% primary nonresponse and 75% secondary loss of response). All had previously received anti-TNF agents. VDZ was prescribed as the second-, third-, or fourth-line biologic in 37%, 50%, and 13% of cases, respectively. Patients had a mean baseline partial Mayo score of 7. (SD 2.1) and received a median of 15 GMA sessions (range -38). After a median follow-up of 7. months (IQR -12), partial Mayo score decreased after 1 and 6 months (P = .01 and .06, respectively). Three patients (38%) achieved steroid-free clinical remission and five (63%) withdrew VDZ. Colectomy rate was 38%. No adverse events were observed during the combination therapy.This small case series suggests that combining GMA with VDZ could be a treatment option in selected cases of UC with an inadequate response to this biologic agent.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447932>Uveitis manifestations in patients of the Swiss Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort Study.</a></h1><p>The knowledge about risk factors for the onset of uveitis manifestations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still limited. Here, we aimed to provide an overview of the clinical factors associated with the onset of uveitis in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study (SIBDCS).We included epidemiological and clinical data from 1840 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 1426 patients with ulcerative  (UC) followed up in the SIBDCS between 2006 and 2018. Associations between disease characteristics and uveitis were assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses.Overall, we identified 285 patients with uveitis. Uveitis was more frequent in patients with CD (11.1%; 205 of 1635) than UC (.6%; 80 of 1346; odds ratio 2.11,  < 0.001). The occurrence of uveitis manifestations in patients with UC and CD was significantly associated with the onset of other extraintestinal manifestations, also in multivariate analyses. The onset of uveitis was associated with the hallmark features of severe disease in both CD and UC, including a higher clinical disease activity index and the use of immunomodulators or calcineurin inhibitors. In CD, uveitis was more frequent in females and showed a positive correlation with a positive family history of IBD.Our data demonstrate that uveitis in IBD occurs more often in CD as well as in women and is associated with a more severe disease course.

The secondary end point was to provide characterization of incident cancer types.All incident cases of cancer occurring in IBD patients from December 2011-2017 were prospectively recorded in 16 Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease units. Each of the IBD patients with a new diagnosis of cancer was matched with 2 IBD patients without cancer, according to IBD phenotype (ulcerative  [UC] vs Crohn's disease [CD]), age (± years), sex. Risk factors were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.Cancer occurred in 403 IBD patients: 204 CD (CD cases), 199 UC (UC cases). The study population included 1209 patients (403 IBD cases, 806 IBD controls). Cancer (n = 403) more frequently involved the digestive system (DS; 32%), followed by skin (14.9%), urinary tract (9.7%), lung (6.9%), genital tract (6.%), breast (.%), thyroid (1.9%), lymphoma (2.7%, only in CD), adenocarcinoma of the small bowel (SBA; 3.9%, 15 CD, 1 pouch in UC), other cancers (15.9%). Among cancers of the DS, colorectal cancer (CRC) more frequently occurred in UC (29% vs 17%; P < 0.005), whereas SBA more frequently occurred in CD (13% vs 6.3% P = 0.039). In CD, perforating (B3) vs non-stricturing non-perforating (B1) behavior represented the only risk factor for any cancer (odds ratio [OR], 2.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-4.11). In CD, risk factors for extracolonic cancer (ECC) were a B3 vs B1 and a stricturing (B2) vs B1 behavior (OR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.62-.43; OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.09-2.98). In UC, risk factors for ECC and for overall cancer were abdominal surgery for UC (OR, 4.63; 95% CI, 2.62-8.42; OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.88-.92) and extensive vs distal UC (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.10-2.75; OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.16-3.47). Another risk factor for ECC was left-sided vs distal UC (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.00-2.86). Inflammatory bowel disease duration was a risk factor for skin and urinary tract cancers.Perforating CD, extensive UC, and abdominal surgery for UC were identified as risk factors for overall incident cancer and for ECC.

We investigated features of PSC-IBD in children, compared to children with IBD without PSC.We performed a retrospective study of 74 children with PSC-IBD, diagnosed from 2000 through 2018, who were each matched with 2 children with ulcerative  or IBD-unclassified (controls) based on sex, date of birth, and type of IBD. We compared IBD distribution and clinical activity (remission, medication use, hospitalization, or colectomy) and patient growth between groups. Data were extracted from each hospital contact and analyzed using mixed effects analyses or Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for time-dependent medication exposure.Higher proportions of children with PSC-IBD had backwash ileitis, pancolitis, and rectal sparing, and more severe right-sided disease, than controls (P<.05). Patients with PSC-IBD were more likely to be treated with only -ASA, compared with controls (odds ratio [OR], 3.04; 95% CI, 1.44-6.41) and to have IBD in clinical remission (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.78-4.87). Risk of colectomy or treatment with a biologic agent was lower in patients with PSC-IBD than controls (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.12-0.52). However, determination of IBD severity based on symptoms underestimated severity based on endoscopic activity in patients with PSC-IBD. Among patients with IBD in clinical remission, those with PSC were less likely to have endoscopic remission (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20-0.96). Patients with PSC-IBD were shorter and had lower weight over time, compared with controls.In a retrospective study, we found that features of IBD differed between children with vs without PSC, similar to adults. Despite the mild clinical activity of IBD in patients with PSC, lack of symptoms does not always indicate lack of mucosal inflammation. Children with PSC-IBD have greater growth impairments compared to children with ulcerative  or IBD-unclassified.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We included new vedolizumab users with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC) between 18 and 64 years with ≥12 months of continuous enrollment prior to initiating vedolizumab. Outcomes included treatment persistence >14 weeks, late steroid use, IBD-related surgery and infections associated with hospitalization. We built multivariable regression models to identify predictors of treatment persistence and late steroid use.We identified 269 CD and 187 UC vedolizumab initiators. Only 60% of CD patients and 56% of UC patients remained on vedolizumab after 14 weeks without IBD-related hospitalization, surgery, and corticosteroid use. There were no significant predictors of treatment persistence. Steroid use in the first 2 months of vedolizumab initiation was a significant predictor of late steroid use in CD (odds ratio: 23.34; 95% confidence interval: .10-153.89). In the 6 months after vedolizumab initiation, 1.9% of CD and .9% of UC patients had an IBD-related surgery. Serious infections were <4%.These data reflect the early U.S. experience with vedolizumab. The population-level response to vedolizumab therapy is just >50%. Steroids at the time of vedolizumab initiation is the strongest predictor of late steroid use in CD.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative  patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of . The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of  that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Among 122 eligible inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, 65 met the inclusion criteria. Combined EN and PN was administered for 21 days, wherein over the first 3- days of treatment, trophic enteral nutrition (300 kcal/day) was used with an energy increase of up to 1500 kcal.

Because these subtypes of IBD are characterized by periods of activity and remission, an understanding of the modulation of biochemical markers with the clinical features of IBD or its treatment, may be useful for determining the correct treatment protocol.This study aimed to evaluate the serum levels of 27 protein biomarkers to determine their association with IBD, correlation with clinical findings of disease, and modulation according to the pharmacologic therapy.A case-control study was carried out in Zacatecas, Mexico. The 27 protein profiles of serum from 53 participants (23 UC, 11 CD, and 19 controls) were evaluated using the Pro Human Cytokine 27-Plex immunoassay (Bio-Rad).Considering the controls as a reference, the group with IBD endoscopic activity showed higher serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) (P < .05). Interferon-induced protein 10 (IP-10) was associated with extraintestinal symptoms of disease (P = .041). Both PDGF-BB and interleukin 6 (IL-6) showed the strongest correlations with clinical features of IBD.

Combined therapy with -ASA + Adalimumab led to the strongest changes in marker modulation: IL-4, IL-, IL-15, and PDGF-BB, were upregulated (P < .05).Elevated serum levels of G-CSF, IL-1Ra, and PDGF-BB were associated with IBD endoscopic activity, and of IP-10 with extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. Combined therapy of -ASA + Adalimumab produced significant upregulation of IL-4, IL-, IL-15, and PDGF-BB. This information may be useful for deciding on the course of pharmacologic therapy for patients with IBD and for generating new therapy alternatives to improve the outcome of patients with IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628978>In Vitro and Human Pharmacoscintigraphic Evaluation of an Oral -ASA Delivery System for Colonic Release.</a></h1><p>-aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) is the most widely used drug for the treatment of ulcerative . The benefits of targeted delivery of -ASA to the large intestine are well known, resulting in reduced systemic absorption and increased local concentrations at the disease site. In the present study, a -ASA colon delivery system based on the time-dependent strategy, exploiting the relatively consistent small intestinal transit time (SITT), was manufactured and evaluated in vitro as well as in vivo. The system was obtained by successive spray-coating of an immediate-release tablet core with low-viscosity HPMC and Eudragit® L. The enteric film was effective in preventing release during the acidic stage of the in vitro test, while the HPMC coating brought about reproducible lag phases prior to release in phosphate buffer medium. A γ-scintigraphy investigation pointed out that, following administration to fasted and fed volunteers, disintegration of the units never occurred prior to colon arrival. In all cases, a lag time preceded the appearance of the drug and its N-acetyl metabolite in the bloodstream, which was found to correlate with the time of disintegration in a linear mode. The plasma levels of the drug and metabolite as well as their cumulative urinary recovery were relatively low with respect to those reported when -ASA is delivered to the small bowel.Copyright © 2019.

IBD patients often present with more risk factors for postoperative complication like malnutrition or immunosuppression, and the impact of SCBs and ERPs in this population is understudied.Crohn's disease and ulcerative  patients undergoing elective bowel resection at a tertiary-level referral center from 2013 to 2018 were retrospectively evaluated. Postoperative complications at 30 days including SSI, ileus, and anastomotic leak were compared between pre-SCB/ERP, post-SCB, and post-SCB + ERP time periods using institutional ACS-NSQIP data. Pediatric (age < 18 years) and emergent cases were excluded.Out of 977 patients, 224 were pre-SCB/ERP, 517 post-SCB, and 236 post-SCB + ERP. Gender (P = 0.01), race (P = 0.02), body mass index (P = 0.04), immunosuppressant use (P = 0.01), wound classification (P < 0.001), malnutrition (P < 0.001), duration of procedure (P = 0.04), and procedure performed (P = 0.01) were significantly different between the three cohorts. A significant decrease in the rates of SSI (14.7% to .%), ileus (20.1% to 8.9%), and anastomotic leak (4.7% to 0.0%) was demonstrated after implementation of SCB and ERP (P ≤ 0.01). On multivariable regression, the risk for postoperative SSI and ileus decreased significantly post-SCB + ERP (OR 0.39, CI 0.19-0.82 and OR 0.45, CI 0.24-0.84, respectively).SCB and ERP implementation was associated with decreased rates of postoperative SSI, ileus, and anastomotic leak for IBD patients undergoing elective bowel resection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607541>Rescue from Stx2-Producing E. coli-Associated Encephalopathy by Intravenous Injection of Muse Cells in NOD-SCID Mice.</a></h1><p>Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) causes hemorrhagic , hemolytic uremic syndrome, and acute encephalopathies that may lead to sudden death or severe neurologic sequelae. Current treatments, including immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoadsorption, plasma exchange, steroid pulse therapy, and the monoclonal antibody eculizumab, have limited effects against the severe neurologic sequelae. Multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cells are endogenous reparative non-tumorigenic stem cells that naturally reside in the body and are currently under clinical trials for regenerative medicine. When administered intravenously, Musecells accumulate to the damaged tissue, where they exert anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, and immunomodulatory effects, and replace damaged cells by differentiating into tissue-constituent cells. Here, severely immunocompromised non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice orally inoculated with 9 × 10 colony-forming units of STEC O111 and treated 48 h later with intravenous injection of  × 10 Muse cells exhibited 100% survival and no severe after-effects of infection. Suppression of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) by RNAi abolished the beneficial effects of Muse cells, leading to a 40% death and significant body weight loss, suggesting the involvement of G-CSF in the beneficial effects of Muse cells in STEC-infected mice. Thus, intravenous administration of Muse cells could be a candidate therapeutic approach for preventing fatal encephalopathy after STEC infection.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The clinical data of 161 children with IBD was collected from the electronic medical records in the Department of Pediatrics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine from January 2012 to December 2017. These patients were divided into Crohn's disease (CD) group and ulcerative  (UC) group, accounting for 82.0% (132 cases) and 18.0%(29 cases), respectively. The incidence of EIMs in each group was analyzed. The potential risk factors of EIMs including the IBD phenotype, gender, age, location of the CD lesion, disease activity of CD, and the presence of perianal lesion were analyzed with logistic regression model.  Eighty-eight patients (54.7%) had EIMs. The main EIMs were immune-mediated EIMs and growth retardation, accounting for 41.0% (66/161) and 24.2% (39/161), respectively. Aphthous ulcer (39/161, 23.0%) was the most common symptom among immune-mediated EIMs, followed by arthropathy (20/161, 12.4%) and skin lesions (19/161, 11.8%). Forty-three patients (26.7%) had EIMs before being diagnosed as IBD. Fifty-eight (65.9%) patients had only one EIM during the whole course of IBD. By logistic regression analysis, CD (.536, 95:1.825-16.788) and perianal disease (1.969, 95:1.035-3.746) were the risk factors of immune-mediated EIMs. Meanwhile, CD (11.319, 95: 1.487-86.179), younger than six-year-old at diagnosis (8.556, 95: 3.109-23.545), moderate to severe activity of CD (3.447, 95: 1.196-9.934) and perianal disease (3.361, 95: 1.720-7.793) increased the risk of growth retardation.  The children with IBD have a high incidence of EIMs, which were more common in CD than in UC. The risk factors of developing EIMs include CD, perianal diseases, younger than six-year-old at diagnosis and moderate to severe activity of CD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608129>Erratum: Changes in expression of p53 and inflammatory factors in patients with ulcerative .</a></h1><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3892/etm.2019.7253.].Copyright: © Su et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531314>Serological investigation of IgG and IgE antibodies against food antigens in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h1><p>Food antigens have been shown to participate in the etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but their clinical value in IBD is still unclear.To analyze the levels of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and E (IgE) antibodies against food antigens in IBD patients and to determine their clinical value in the pathogenesis of IBD.We performed a retrospective study based on patients who visited the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between August 2016 and January 2018. A total of 137 IBD patients, including 40 patients with ulcerative  (UC) and 97 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and 50 healthy controls (HCs), were recruited. Serum food-specific IgG antibodies were detected by semi-quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and serum food-specific IgE antibodies were measured by Western blot. The value of food-specific IgG antibodies was compared among different groups, and potent factors related to these antibodies were explored by binary logistic regression.Food-specific IgG antibodies were detected in 57.% of UC patients, in 90.72% of CD patients and in 42% of HCs. A significantly high prevalence and titer of food-specific IgG antibodies were observed in CD patients compared to UC patients and HCs. The number of IgG-positive foods was greater in CD and UC patients than in HCs (CD  HCs,  = 0.000; UC  HCs,  = 0.029). The top five food antigens that caused positive specific IgG antibodies in CD patients were tomato (80.68%), corn (69.32%), egg (63.64%), rice (61.36%), and soybean (46.59%). The foods that caused positive specific IgG antibodies in UC patients were egg (60.87%), corn (47.83%), tomato (47.83%), rice (26.09%), and soybean (21.74%). Significantly higher levels of total food-specific IgG were detected in IBD patients treated with anti-TNFα therapy compared to patients receiving steroids and immunosuppressants (anti-TNFα  steroids,  = 0.000; anti-TNFα  immunosuppressants,  = 0.000; anti-TNFα  steroids + immunosuppressants,  = 0.003). A decrease in food-specific IgG levels was detected in IBD patients after receiving anti-TNFα therapy ( = 0.007). Patients who smoked and CD patients were prone to developing serum food-specific IgG antibodies [Smoke: OR (95%CI): 17.6 (1.91-162.26),  = 0.011; CD patients: OR (95%CI): 12.48 (3.45-45.09),  = 0.000]. There was no difference in the prevalence of food-specific IgE antibodies among CD patients (57.1%), UC patients (65.2%) and HCs (60%) ( = 0.831).CD patients have a higher prevalence of food-specific IgG antibodies than UC patients and HCs. IBD patients are prone to rice, corn, tomato and soybean intolerance. Smoking may be a risk factor in the occurrence of food-specific IgG antibodies. Food-specific IgG antibodies may be a potential method in the diagnosis and management of food intolerance in IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594031>Longitudinal changes in bone mineral density in children with inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h1><p>Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are prone to low bone mineral density (BMD). Our aim was to assess longitudinal changes in BMD in this population.A retrospective longitudinal study of children with IBD, treated at two tertiary centres in Israel, who underwent two BMD measurements by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Changes in lumbar spine BMD (∆L1-4 z-scores) were examined for correlations with clinical characteristics.The cohort included 41 patients (age at diagnosis 12.1 ± 3. years, 23 females).The mean interval between the scans was 3.4 ± 2.0 years. There was a trend towards improvement in L1-4 z-scores (-1.64 ± 1.02 vs -1.45 ± 0.83, P = .12). ∆L1-4 z-scores correlated positively with ∆weight-standard deviation scores (SDS), ∆height-SDS and ∆BMI-SDS, and with age at the second scan (R = .55, P < .01; R = .42, P < .01; R = .42, P = .01; R = .35, P = .02, respectively); and negatively with L1-4 z-scores at the first scan (R = -.63, P < .01). Stepwise linear regression analysis identified the first scan L1-4 z-scores and ∆weight-SDS as independent predictors of ∆L1-4 z-scores. An L1-4 z-score ≤-2 at the first DXA scan was associated with significant improvement at the second scan.Improvement in BMD was more pronounced in children who gained weight or whose BMD was low at the first scan.© 2019 Foundation Acta Paediatrica.

Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of febuxostat against ulcerative , and to elucidate the potential mechanisms involved. Experimental  was induced in mice by intrarectal administration of % acetic acid. Mice were treated with febuxostat (10 and 20 mg/kg/day, orally) for three days. Results showed that body weight loss, colon shortening, macroscopic damage and histopathological changes of colonic mucosa were reduced in mice treated with febuxostat. Treatment of mice with febuxostat significantly increased the levels of glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonyl protein, xanthine oxidase, nitric oxide (NO) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity of colon tissue compared with those in the acetic acid-induced  group. The expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) as a key regulator of inflammation in the colonic tissue was decreased by febuxostat. Furthermore treatment with febuxostat significantly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and interferon (IFN)-γ, while increased the levels of IL-10 compared with the  group. These results suggest that febuxostat is able to decrease the severity of acetic acid-induced  by inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses through NF-κB pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We utilized the latest available country-specific incidence rates, and aggregate data for 20 determinants, from over 50 countries accounting for more than half of the global population. We presented the associations with exponentiated beta coefficients [exp(β)] indicating the relative increase of disease incidence per unit increase in the predictor variables.Country-specific incidence estimates demonstrate wide variability across the world, with a median of 4.8 new UC cases (IQR 2.4-9.3), and 3. new CD cases (IQR 0.8-.7) per 100,000 population per year. Latitude [exp(β) 1.05, 95% CI 1.04‒1.06, per degree increase], prevalence of obesity (1.05, 1.02‒1.07, per 1% increase) and of tobacco smoking (0.97, 0.95‒0.99, per 1% increase) explained 71.% of UC incidence variation across countries in the adjusted analysis. The model for CD included latitude (1.04, 1.02‒1.06), expenditure for health (1.03, 1.01‒1.05, per 100 PPP/year per capita increase) and physical inactivity prevalence (1.03, 1.00‒1.06, per 1% increase) explaining 58.3% of incidence variation across countries. Besides expenditure for health, these associations were consistent in low/middle- and high-income countries.Our analysis highlights factors able to explain a substantial portion of incidence variation across countries.

Patients with active UC have elevated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) concentrations in serum and colonic tissue. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against TNF and binds with high affinity. Target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) is reported for monoclonal antibodies meaning that their pharmacokinetics are affected by high target affinity. Here, a TMDD model is proposed to describe the interaction between infliximab and TNF in UC patients. Data from 20 patients with moderate to severe UC was used. Patients received standard infliximab induction therapy ( mg kg) at week 0, followed by infusions at week 2 and 6. IFX, anti-drug antibodies and TNF serum concentrations were measured at day 0 (1 h after infusion), 1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 28 and 42. A binding model, TMDD model, and a quasi-steady state (QSS) approximation were evaluated using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM). A two-compartment model best described the concentration-time profiles of infliximab. Typical clearance of infliximab was 0.404 L day and increased with the presence of anti-drug antibodies and with lower albumin concentrations. The TMDD-QSS model best described the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data. Estimate for TNF baseline (B was 19.8 pg mL and the dissociation constant (K) was 13.6 nM.

While pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a well-defined disease with established guidelines, Eosinophilic Gastritis (EoG), Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis (EoGE) and Eosinophilic  (EoC) remain a clinical enigma with evidence based on limited anecdotal case reports. Large cross-sectional studies in US defined a prevalence of EoG and EoGE ranging from 1, to 6,4/100.000 and from 2,7 to 8,3/100.000 subjects respectively, while prevalence of EoC ranges from 1,7 to 3,/100.000 subjects. Regarding the pathogenesis, it is hypothesized that EGIDs result from the interplay between genetic predisposition, intestinal dysbiosis and environmental triggers. Clinically, EGIDs might present with different and nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms depending on the involved intestinal tract and the extension of eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. The diagnosis of EGIDs requires: 1. recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, 2. increased eosinophils for high power field in biopsy specimens, 3. absence of secondary causes of gastrointestinal eosinophilia. No validated guidelines are available on the clinical management of patients with EGIDs. Evidence from case reports and small uncontrolled case series suggests the use of dietary and corticosteroids as the first-line treatments. Considering the clinical follow-up of EGIDs, three different patterns of disease course are identified: single flare, recurring course-disease and chronic course-disease.

We evaluated the effect of oral IgG on clinical course of diarrhea in pediatric kidney transplant recipients. We retrospectively studied all pediatric kidney transplant recipients who required hospitalization for diarrhea between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017. We divided the recipients into two groups based on whether they had received oral IgG to treat diarrhea. Sixteen pediatric kidney transplant recipients required hospitalization for diarrhea over 3 years. Median age at admission was 9.25 years (IQR:12.54). Fifty-six percent of recipients were male, and 81% were white. Four patients received oral IgG for prolonged diarrhea. Oral IgG recipients had longer diarrheal duration before admission (median (days) 14. vs1; P .02), a trend for greater weight loss at admission (median (kilogram) 1.4 vs 0.2; P .3), and a trend for higher acute kidney injury (>75% reduction in glomerular filtration rate: 100% vs 42%; P .36).

Curcumin has anti-inflammatory properties and induces endoscopic remission in patients with ulcerative . We investigated the efficacy of curcumin vs placebo in preventing post-operative recurrence of CD, based on endoscopic and clinical indices, in patients receiving concomitant thiopurine therapy.We conducted a double-blind randomized controlled trial at 8 referral centers in France, from October 2014 through January 2018, of 62 consecutive patients with CD undergoing bowel resection. Patients received azathioprine (2. mg/kg) and were randomly assigned to groups given oral curcumin (3 g/day; n = 31) or an identical placebo (n = 31) for 6 months, and were then evaluated by colonoscopy. We also collected data on CD activity index, results from laboratory tests, and answers to quality of life questionnaires during this 6-month period. The primary endpoint was postoperative recurrence of CD in each group (Rutgeerts' index score ≥i2) at month 6 (determined by central reading). An interim analysis (intent to treat) was scheduled after 50% of the patients were enrolled.At month 6, postoperative recurrence (Rutgeerts' index score ≥i2) occurred in 18 patients (58%) receiving curcumin and 21 patients (68%) receiving placebo (P = .60). A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving curcumin (55%) had a severe recurrence of CD (Rutgeerts' index score ≥i3) than patients receiving placebo (26%) (P = .034). We observed a clinical recurrence of CD (CD activity index score >150) at month 6 in 45% of patients receiving placebo and 30% of patients receiving curcumin (P = .80). Quality of life scores at month 6 did not differ significantly between groups (P = .80). Severe adverse events developed in 6% of patients receiving placebo and 16% of patients receiving curcumin (P = .42).In a randomized controlled trial of patients who underwent surgery for CD and received thiopurine treatment, we found that curcumin was no more effective than placebo in preventing CD recurrence. There were no significant differences between groups in quality of life or severe adverse events. The study was discontinued after interim analysis due to futility.

However, the magnitude of short stature at adulthood is not well characterized. We aimed to determine the prevalence and predictors of growth impairment at diagnosis and adulthood in children with IBD.Height z-scores at diagnosis of IBD and at adulthood among 291 children with Crohn's disease (CD) and 125 with ulcerative  (UC) were retrieved retrospectively and compared to matched controls. Growth impairment at diagnosis was defined as height z-score for age less than or equal to -1 and short stature at adulthood as less than or equal to -2.Mean height z-score at adulthood in subjects with CD or UC was significantly different from controls although mean height did differ in males only (CD 172.3 cm ± 6.7, UC 172.7 cm ± .3, controls: 174.2 cm ± 7.3, p = 0.003 and p = 0.047, respectively). Diagnosis prior to final stage of puberty and male gender were risk factors for being short statured at adulthood in CD (mean difference [MD] 2., p = 0.013 and MD 6.25, p = 0.001, respectively) and UC (MD 4.9, p = 0.011 and MD 3.3, p = 0.034, respectively).Increased proportion of pediatric-onset IBD patients has growth impairment at adulthood. Male gender and diagnosis prior to puberty were found to impose risk for reduced adult height in both diseases.© 2019 S.

N+ patients were compared to the control group (N-) for clinical variables. The evaluation of risk factors for N+ was assessed using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses.A total of 130 patients were included. Median duration of disease was 21 years (1-52). Forty patients (30.8%) were N+ at surgery. Eighteen (13.8%) developed cancer within 10 years from the onset of UC. Younger age at surgery (Odds ratio -OR- 0.96, p = 0.042), left colon location (OR 2.44, p = 0.045) and the presence of stricture (OR .07, p = 0.002) were associated with N+.Location in the left colon, presence of strictures and younger age strongly correlated with a higher risk of N+ cancer, which could develop before the starting point of surveillance. Duration, extension and severity of disease were not associated with N+.

The most notable drawbacks of CART are cytokine release syndrome and CART-related encephalopathy syndrome. Gastrointestinal adverse events (GI-AEs) have not yet been reported in association with CART. Herein, we describe the incidence and clinical features of GI-AEs observed after CART.We report a case series of patients with hematologic malignancies who received CART, in a clinical trial or as the standard of care, and subsequently suffered from GI-AEs between 2012 and 2018.In our cohort, 37 of 132 (28%) patients experienced GI-AEs. All 37 experienced diarrhea with a median onset of 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 25 d) after CART infusion. The median age of these patients was 58 years. Most had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (51%). Seventeen patients experienced cytokine release syndrome, and 9 experienced CART-related encephalopathy syndrome. The interleukin-6 antagonist was required in 15 patients. Overall, 49% of patients had grade 1 diarrhea, 32% had grade 2, and 15% had grade 3. Other gastrointestinal symptoms in these patients were abdominal pain (41%), nausea and vomiting (49%), fever (8%), bloody stools (3%), and abdominal distension (%). The median duration of symptoms was 6 days (interquartile range, 3 to 9 d). In 32 patients who underwent imaging, 8 (25%) had findings suggestive of gastrointestinal tract inflammation. Nine (24%) patients experienced GI-AE recurrence after initial improvement. The symptoms were attributed to an alternative cause in 17 (13%) cases and to CART in 20 (15%) cases. One patient developed CART-related refractory  that eventually responded to antibiotics for pneumonia.CART-related GI-AEs occur in 15% of patients treated with CART. These symptoms are typically mild and self-limiting, requiring only symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, CART may, in rare cases, lead to refractory .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550869>Risk Factors for Postoperative Recurrence in Korean Patients with Crohn's Disease.</a></h1><p>A considerable number of patients with Crohn's disease still need intestinal resection surgery. Postoperative recurrence is an important issue in Crohn's disease management, including the selection of high-risk patients. Eastern Asian patients showed several differences from Caucasian patients. Therefore, we investigated the postoperative surgical recurrence outcome and identified risk factors in Korean patients.Clinical data of 372 patients with Crohn's disease who underwent first intestinal resection between January 2004 and August 2014 at 14 hospitals in Korea were retrospectively reviewed.Over the follow-up period, 50 patients (17.1%) showed surgical recurrence. The cumulative surgical recurrence rate was 6.% at 1 year and 15.4% at 7 years. Age under 16 (p=0.011; hazard ratio [HR], .136; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.576 to 16.731), colonic involvement (p=0.023; HR , 2.011; 95% CI, 1.102 to 3.670), and the presence of perianal disease at surgery (p=0.008; HR, 2.239; 95% CI, 1.236 to 4.059) were independent risk factors associated with surgical recurrence. Postoperative thiopurine treatment (p=0.002; HR, 0.393; 95% CI, 0.218 to 0.710) was a protective factor for surgical recurrence.Among the disease characteristics at surgery, younger age, colonic location, and perianal lesions were independent risk factors for surgical recurrence.

These conditions can accelerate complement activation that results in a positive feedback cycle. The known triggers for complement activation can be diverse and include, infection, autoimmune disease, and malignancy. Recent reports suggest that certain autoimmune and rheumatological triggers of complement activation may result in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome that does not resolve despite treating the underlying disorder. Specifically, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and microangiopathic hemolysis may not respond to treatment of their underlying rheumatological trigger but responded to complement blockade.We report two patients with inflammatory bowel disease complicated by development of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. In both cases, patients were on treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, that was not well controlled/flaring at the time. The first patient is a male who developed Crohn's disease and microangiopathic hemolysis at age  and was treated with eculizumab successfully. Discontinuation of the medication led to multiple relapses, and the patient currently is being treated with eculizumab and has normal hematological and stable renal parameters. The second patient is a 49-year-old female with Ulcerative  treated with 6-Mercaptopurine. She developed acute kidney injury and microangiopathic hemolysis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with eculizumab resulted in the recovery of kidney injury along with a complete hematological response.These two cases are the fifth and sixth patients to be published in the literature with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease treated with complement blockade. This confirms that C5 complement blockade is effective in treating complement mediated thrombotic microangiopathy/atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome when it is triggered in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626205>[Morphology of the thymus and the specific features of its cellular composition in experimental acute and chronic ulcerative ].</a></h1><p>To investigate morphological changes in the thymus, the subpopulation composition of lymphocytes and its non-lymphoid cells in dextran-induced experimental acute ulcerative  and in different periods of chronic ulcerative .Acute and chronic ulcerative  was simulated in C57BL/6 mice, by replacing drinking water with a 1% aqueous dextran sulfate sodium solution. Thymic changes were morphometrically assessed; the number and absolute area of thymic corpuscles and epithelial cells were calculated; and the subpopulation composition of lymphocytes and thymic stromal cells was determined using flow cytofluorimetry; the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney test were used to compare the groups.In acute catarrhal and ulcerative , there was acute accidental thymic involution with devastation of the cortical substance and with a decline in its volume fraction, with an increase in the levels of cells dying through the mechanism of apoptosis, and with a decrease in the absolute number of lymphocytes, T-helper cells, cytotoxic T-cells, regulatory T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, and dendritic cells, with a rise in the index of the area of thymic corpuscles and in the content of late-phase corpuscles among them, and with the appearance of thymic corpuscles as cyst-like cavities. In chronic ulcerative , the cortex was expanded and the area of thymic corpuscles and the count of medullary epithelial cells increased. The cyst-like thymic corpuscles formed clusters, the count of dendritic cells increased in early-stage chronic ulcerative , but the levels of macrophages decreased in both periods of its development.There is acute accidental involution and thymic hyperplasia with an increase in medullary epithelial cells and thymic corpuscles consisting of cytokeratin 19 in the epithelial cells in experimental acute and chronic ulcerative , respectively. The more pronounced epithelial cell response found in end-stage experimental chronic ulcerative  reflects the enhanced differentiation of regulatory T-lymphocytes and the larger number of which is observed in peripheral blood and in the focus of inflammation in patients with ulcerative , according to the literature.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579961>The impact of anti-TNFα therapy on colectomy rates and corticosteroid treatment among 3001 paediatric and adolescent patients with ulcerative -a nationwide study from 1995 to 2015.</a></h1><p>The long-term effects of anti-TNFα therapy in ulcerative  are debatable.To examine whether anti-TNFα therapy changed the colectomy proportion and reduced the use of corticosteroids.A nationwide cohort study among patients (age 0-20) diagnosed with ulcerative  through 1995-2015 from Danish health registries. We calculated the cumulative -year risk of colectomy after diagnosis and used a Cox regression model for comparison between a historical pre-anti-TNFα cohort 1 (1995-2003) and a cohort 2 for the era of anti-TNFα (2004-2015). Based on anti-TNFα users, defined as patients who had at least four anti-TNFα treatments within 4 months, we examined the subsequent need for corticosteroids.We identified 3001 patients from 1995 to 2015. The -year cumulative proportion of colectomy in cohort 2 was 9.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.4-11.1) and 12.3% (95% CI 10.4-14.6) in cohort 1. The adjusted -year hazard ratio (HR) was 0.76 (95% CI 0.60-0.96) for colectomy in cohort 2 compared to cohort 1. A total of 334 patients received anti-TNFα treatments, and 16.8% (56/334) were prescribed corticosteroids in the subsequent 3-month period. Corticosteroid treatment declined with follow-up after 6 and 12 months, .4% and 1.2%, respectively.In patient's ≤20 years, the HR for colectomy within a period of  years from the time of diagnosis was reduced in the era of anti-TNFα compared to a historical cohort.

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for nonadherence.This was a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with IBD treated at a tertiary care center and prescribed self-injectable biologic therapy using the center's specialty pharmacy. Adherence was defined using medication possession ratio (MPR). Nonadherence was defined as MPR <0.86.Four hundred sixty patients (n = 393 with CD and n = 67 with UC) were evaluated with mean MPR (interquartile range) equaling 0.89 (0.48-1). Overall, 69% of patients were adherent (defined as MPR ≥0.86), 66% of patients with CD and 87% of patients with UC. In univariate analysis, several factors increased risk of nonadherence: CD diagnosis, insurance type, psychiatric history, smoking, prior biologic use, and narcotic use (P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, Medicaid insurance (odds ratio [OR], .; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-15.6) and CD diagnosis (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.0) increased risk of nonadherence. In CD, as the number of risk factors increased (narcotic use, psychiatric history, prior biologic use, and smoking), the probability of nonadherence increased. Adherence was 72% in patients with 0-1 risk factors, decreasing to 62%, 61%, and 42% in patients with 2, 3, and 4 risk factors, respectively (P < 0.05).This study identified risk factors for nonadherence to biologic therapy. In patients with CD, the probability of nonadherence increased as the number of risk factors increased.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s &  Foundation 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599507>Ethnic Variations in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Among Israel's Populations.</a></h1><p>Crohn's disease and ulcerative  are the two major classic presentations of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Studies have shown a wide variation in the incidence and prevalence attributed to different geographic and ethnic populations.To assess the clinical characteristics of IBD among Arabs in Israel and to compare them to characteristics of IBD among Ashkenazi Jews.This retrospective, comparative study compared the clinical characteristics of IBD among 150 Arabs from the Holy Family Hospital and the Nazareth Hospital EMMS, both located in Nazareth, Israel, to those of 97 age- and sex-matched Ashkenazi Jewish patients from Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.The Arab cohort, which included 106 patients (70%) with Crohn's disease and 44 (29%) with ulcerative , was compared to 97 Ashkenazi patients (81% with Crohn's disease and 17% with ulcerative ) (P < 0.05). Alcohol consumption was found in both groups, but Arabs smoked more (46% vs. 12%, respectively, P < 0.05). Obstructive phenotype was lower in Arabs (10% vs. 32%, P < 0.05). -aminosalicylic acid and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha were prescribed for the Arab and Ashkenazi groups (89% and 21%, respectively). The need for surgical intervention due to disease severity and/or complications was not significant (22% vs. 24%).Despite similar reports of NOD2/CARD15 mutations, Crohn's disease is more common than ulcerative  within the Arab-Israeli population. Increased smoking rates may explain milder disease severities in Arabs, as reflected by lower obstructive pattern and frequent use of milder therapeutic modalities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660640>Efficacy and safety of tofacitinib dose de-escalation and dose escalation for patients with ulcerative : results from OCTAVE Open.</a></h1><p>For patients with UC, flexible maintenance dosing therapy may confer advantages for safety, efficacy, costs and patient preference. Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule JAK inhibitor for the treatment of UC.To assess the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib dose de-escalation and escalation in patients with UC.We evaluated data (November 2017 data cut-off) from OCTAVE Open, an ongoing, open-label, long-term extension study. The dose de-escalation group comprised 66 tofacitinib induction responders in remission following 52 weeks' tofacitinib 10 mg b.d. maintenance therapy, subsequently de-escalated to  mg b.d. in OCTAVE Open. The dose escalation group comprised 57 tofacitinib induction responders who experienced treatment failure while receiving  mg b.d. maintenance therapy, subsequently escalated to 10 mg b.d. in OCTAVE Open.After tofacitinib de-escalation, 92.4% (61/66) and 84.1% (53/63) of patients maintained clinical response and 80.3% (53/66) and 74.6% (47/63) maintained remission, at months 2 and 12, respectively. After dose escalation, 57.9% (33/57) and 64.9% (37/57) of patients recaptured clinical response and 35.1% (20/57) and 49.1% (28/57) were in remission, at months 2 and 12, respectively. The incidence rate of herpes zoster with dose escalation (7.6 patients with events/100 patient-years) was numerically higher than in the overall tofacitinib UC programme.Following tofacitinib de-escalation in patients already in remission on 10 mg b.d., most maintained remission, although 25.4% lost remission, at month 12. For induction responders who dose-escalated following treatment failure on  mg b.d. maintenance therapy, 49.1% achieved remission by month 12. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: ).© 2019 The Authors.

The objective of the present study was to assess the frequency of PCV-3 infection in serum samples from animals suffering from post-weaning respiratory or digestive disorders as well as in healthy animals. A total of 315 swine serum samples were analysed for PCV-3 DNA detection by conventional PCR; positive samples were further assayed with a quantitative PCR and partially sequenced. Sera were obtained from 4 week- to 4 month-old pigs clinically diagnosed with respiratory (n = 129) or digestive (n = 126) disorders. Serum samples of age-matched healthy animals (n = 60) served as negative control. Pigs with clinical respiratory signs had a wide variety of pulmonary lesions including suppurative bronchopneumonia, interstitial pneumonia, fibrinous-necrotizing pneumonia and/or pleuritis. Animals with enteric signs displayed histopathological findings like villus atrophy and fusion, catarrhal enteritis and/or catarrhal . Overall, PCV-3 DNA was detected in 19 out of 315 analysed samples (6.0%). Among the diseased animals, PCV-3 was found in 6.2% (8 out of 129) and .6% (7 out of 126) of pigs with respiratory and digestive disorders, respectively. The frequency of PCV-3 PCR positive samples among healthy pigs was 6.7% (4 out of 60). No apparent association was observed between PCR positive cases and any type of histopathological lesion. The phylogenetic analysis of the partial genome sequences obtained showed high identity among viruses from the three groups of animals studied. In conclusion, PCV-3 was present in the serum of diseased and healthy pigs to similar percentages, suggesting that this virus does not seem to be causally associated with respiratory or enteric disorders.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518227>Tegaserod for the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Tegaserod (Zelnorm®) is a -hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) type 4 receptor agonist for the treatment of hypomotility disorders of the lower gastrointestinal tract associated with the irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).The authors provide the reader with a better understanding on tegaserod mechanism of action, on its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties, on safety and tolerability, with a summary of the key published clinical trials conducted in patients with IBS. Its effects on colon inflammation have also been described.Tegaserod was withdrawn in 2007 due to increased risks of cardiovascular adverse effects. The manufacturer denied this, because pre-existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors were attributed to all affected patients. Thus, no causal relationship between tegaserod use and cardiovascular events was clearly shown. A matched case-control study of tegaserod-treated with untreated patients found no association between tegaserod and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Despite its adverse effects, tegaserod resulted to be effective in treating chronic constipation in adult women aged < 65 years with IBS-C, while the safety and effectiveness of tegaserod in men with IBS-C have not been established. Tegaserod was resubmitted to the Food and Drug Administration in 2018 for use in a low-risk population. Moreover, tegaserod has also been shown to improve symptoms, enhance gastric accommodation and significantly attenuate visceral pain arising from the colon in functional dyspepsia patients.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of locally administered adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells in a model of high-risk colonic anastomosis in rats.Seven days after induction of  with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, Wistar rats were submitted to a transection of the descending colon followed by end-to-end anastomosis and were then treated with 2×10 adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (from the preperitoneal fat) or an acellular culture solution instilled onto the surface of the anastomosis. At day 14, after macroscopic survey of the abdominal cavity, the anastomotic area was submitted to histologic and immunohistochemical analysis, evaluation of myeloperoxidase activity, fibrosis, epithelial integrity, NF-κ B activation, expression of inflammatory cytokines, and extracellular matrix-related genes.Anastomotic leakage and mortality associated with high-risk anastomosis decreased with treatment with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (P < .03). Application of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells resulted in lower histologic scores (P = .011), decreased deposition of collagen fibers (P = .003), preservation of goblet cells (P = .033), decreased myeloperoxidase activity (P = .012), decreased accumulation of CD4+ T-cells (P = .014) and macrophages (P = .011) in the lamina propria, a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells (P = .008), and the activation of NF-κ B (P = .036). Overexpression of IL-17, TNF-α , IFN-γ, and metalloproteinases in the acellular culture solution-treated, high-risk anastomosis group decreased (P < .05) to near normal values with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells treatment.Improvements in outcomes of a high-risk colonic anastomosis with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells therapy reflect the immunomodulatory activity and healing effect of these cells, even after just topical administration and reinforces their use in future translational research.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Clinical trial data on patients meeting protocol-specified criteria may not reflect real-world clinical practice. This is a descriptive analysis of 4 years of post-marketing safety data on vedolizumab.The Vedolizumab Global Safety Database contains all adverse event reports collated by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd since vedolizumab approval [20-May-2014]. Adverse event reports received between approval and 19-May-2018 were identified using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 21.0 Preferred Terms. Adverse event frequencies were calculated and categorized.In approximately 208,050 patient-years of vedolizumab exposure, 32,752 patients reported 80,218 events. In patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative , 37,662 and 34,259 events occurred in 14,191 and 14,042 patients, respectively, while 8297 events occurred in 4519 individuals with other [off-label] or unreported indications. Overall, 5230 [14%; Crohn's disease] and 3580 [10%; ulcerative ] events were serious. Most frequently reported were gastrointestinal events [Crohn's disease, 6156 (16%) ulcerative , 5701 (17%)]. Patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative  reported 251 malignancies [<1%], 402 hepatobiliary events [<1%] and 5876 infections [1137 serious (19%), 301 opportunistic (%)]. Patients aged ≥70 years [2326 patients] reported <10% of events.Adverse event patterns were consistent with clinical trials, with no new safety concerns. Most reported events were non-serious and event frequency was low, considering patient-years of exposure.

This study aimed to investigate the safety and feasibility of Endocuff Vision-assisted high-definition white light endoscopy (HDWLE) with dye-spray chromoendoscopy for detection of dysplasia in patients with ulcerative .  Patients with clinically inactive ulcerative  due for dysplasia surveillance were recruited. Procedural endpoints included safety, cecal intubation rate (CIR), terminal ileum intubation rate (TIR), withdrawal time, polyp detection rate, dysplasia detection rate (DDR), and sessile serrated lesion detection rate.  Twenty-five patients (9 female, median age 57 [range 28 - 82] years) were studied. Endocuff Vision-assisted HDWLE was completed in all participants, with a CIR of 100 %, in a median 4 minutes (range 2 - 16), and a TIR of 88% in a median of 6. minutes (range 3 - 19). Median withdrawal time was 18 minutes (range 10 - 55), including application of dye-spray, biopsies and polypectomy. The Mayo Endoscopic subscore was 0 in 11, 1 in 9, and 2 in  patients. The DDR was 24 % (6 patients had a total of 12 dysplastic lesions) and sessile serrated lesion detection rate was 12 % (3 patients had a total of 4 sessile serrated polyps). No serious adverse events occurred, with one patient developing clinically insignificant minor mucosal bleeding.  Endocuff Vision-assisted HDWLE is feasible and safe in patients with ulcerative  undergoing dysplasia surveillance.

Defects in such mechanisms can favour the development of chronic intestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC), the principal forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in humans, as well as systemic disorders. Over the last years, the frequency of intestinal and systemic immune-inflammatory disorders has increased in previously low incidence areas, likely due to the Westernization of lifestyles, including dietary habits. The Western diet is characterized by high consumption of proteins, saturated fats and sweets, as well as by a broad use of food additives (e.g., emulsifiers, bulking agents), which are used to preserve and enhance food quality. Accumulating evidence suggests that food additives can perturb gut homeostasis, thereby contributing to promote tissue-damaging inflammatory responses. For instance, mice given the emulsifiers carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate 80 develop dysbiosis with overgrowth of mucus-degrading bacteria. Such an effect triggers  in animals deficient in either interleukin-10, a cytokine exerting anti-inflammatory and regulatory functions, or Toll-like receptor , a receptor recognizing the bacterial flagellin. Similarly, the polysaccharide maltodextrin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress in intestinal goblet cells, thereby impairing mucus release and increasing host susceptibility to .

Asymptomatic patients with a Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) symptom sub-score of zero who underwent an index surveillance pouchoscopy were included. Endoscopic pouch body activity was graded as 0: normal, 1: mucosal inflammation, or 2: mucosal breaks (ulcers and/or erosions). The primary outcome was primary acute idiopathic pouchitis defined as PDAI score ≥ 7 with symptoms lasting less than four weeks and responsive to standard antibiotics, not otherwise meeting criteria for secondary pouchitis. The secondary outcome was chronic idiopathic pouchitis defined as PDAI score ≥ 7 with symptoms lasting greater than four weeks despite standard antibiotics. Predictors of pouchitis were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) reported.143 asymptomatic pouch patients were included. Index endoscopic pouch body activity was 0 in 86 (60.1%) patients, 1 in 26 (18.2%) and 2 in 31 (21.7%). The median length of follow-up after index surveillance pouchoscopy was 3.03 [IQR 1.24-4.60] years. Primary acute idiopathic pouchitis occurred in 44 (31%) patients and chronic idiopathic pouchitis in 12 (8.4%). Grade 2 endoscopic pouch activity was associated with the development of acute pouchitis (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.23-4.67), although not chronic pouchitis (HR 1.76, 95% CI 0.53-.87). Histologic inflammation in endoscopically normal pouch mucosa was not associated with acute or chronic pouchitis.Mucosal breaks are present in nearly a quarter of asymptomatic patients with IPAA and are associated with an increased risk of acute pouchitis.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622538>Fecal microbiota transplantation results in bacterial strain displacement in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h1><p>Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which is thought to have the potential to correct dysbiosis of gut microbiota, has been used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for almost a decade. Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative  (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from  individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

Globally, there are vast differences varying from 0.2/10 in some Asian countries to over 80/10 in the Faroe Islands. Environmental factors have been suggested as triggers. The aim was to investigate the incidence and prevalence of IBD in the 33 municipalities in the county Scania in Southern Sweden, an area comprising 100 × 100 km with 1,274,069 inhabitants. Furthermore, we wanted to explore whether compounds in the drinking water could contribute to IBD; one report from Norway has suggested that iron in drinking water could contribute to UC.  Patients with CD and UC were identified through the ICD-10 diagnosis database during the period 2000-2013. Water analyses for pH, alkaline, nitrate, sulphate, iron, magnesium and calcium were based on established methods and compared with the prevalence of IBD using Student's -test.  A total number of 8925 patients were identified. The incidence for CD and UC were high (mean 16.4/10, range 13.6-17.9 and 25.3/10, range 21.3-28.0, respectively). The prevalence varied substantially ( < .0001 for both; CD mean 0.30%, range 0.15-0.42 and UC mean 0.42%, range 0.32-0.56). No correlation between IBD and the chemical compounds in the drinking water could be shown.  The incidence rates of both CD and UC were high. The prevalence varied from 200% to 300% between the municipalities, despite the limited geographical area indicating that local conditions are of importance. However, chemical compounds in the water were not associated with this variation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621446>Dapsone reduced acetic acid-induced inflammatory response in rat colon tissue through inhibition of NF-kB signaling pathway.</a></h1><p> The purpose of this study is to examine the protective effects of Dapsone on inflammation of intestinal tissue through inhibition of NF-kB pathway in acetic acid-induced  in rats.  Acute  was produced by intra-rectal instillation of 2 mL of 4% acetic acid diluted in normal saline. Then, two hours after induction of , DMSO as vehicle, dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) and dapsone (12. mg/kg) were given to the animals intraperitoneally (i.p.) and continued for five following days. Evaluation of macroscopic and microscopic damages were done. Myeloid peroxidase enzyme (MPO) activity was measured by a biochemical technique. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) activity was identified by ELISA, and the expression level of pNF-kB protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) and dapsone (12. mg/kg) decreased the macroscopic and microscopic damages compared with acetic acid group ( ˂ .001). Additionally, these agents decreased the activity of MPO ( ˂ .001), TNF-α ( ˂ .001) and the expression level of p-NF-kB ( ˂ .001) in rat colon tissue compared with the acetic acid group.  It is proposed that the anti-inflammatory activity of dapsone on acetic acid-induced  in rats may involve the inhibition of NF-kB pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569451>Protective Effect of  Extract against Dextran-Sulfate-Sodium-Induced Ulcerative  in Rats.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel disease is a multifactorial inflammatory condition. This study aimed to test the protective effects of  against ulcerative  (UC). UC was induced in thirty-six male Wistar rats by adding dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to their drinking water, while a control group received only drinking water. UC rats were equally-divided into six groups that received a single oral daily dose of vehicle (DSS), sulfasalazine (SSZ, 50 mg/kg/day), chloroform or the hydroalcoholic extracts of  (100 or 200 mg/kg/day) for 15 days, and then blood and colon samples were harvested for determination of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and histopathology. At the end of the study, compared to time-matched controls, UC rats showed increased TNF-α (1.64-fold), IL-6 (.73-fold), ESR (3.18-fold), and MPO (1.61-fold), along with loss of body weight (24.73%) and disease activity index (1.767 ± 0.216 vs. 0 ± 0),  < 0.001. These effects were prevented by SSZ treatment ( < 0.001 vs. DSS). The hydroalcoholic extract of  dose-dependently modulated all DSS-induced inflammatory changes. However, the chloroform extract significantly lowered only IL-6 and ESR, but not TNF-α or MPO levels. The protective effects of the hydroalcoholic extract of  against experimental UC involved mitigation of DSS-induced inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619442>A Phase I Trial of Berberine in Chinese with Ulcerative .</a></h1><p>The Chinese natural product, berberine, has biological properties supporting potential efficacy as a colon cancer prevention agent. Its longstanding use in China to treat gastrointestinal tract and rheumatologic disorders is generally regarded as safe, supporting initial investigations in an at-risk population, such as individuals with ulcerative  (UC). However, the safety of berberine in this population is not established. Individuals living in China with biopsy-proven UC, ≤ grade 2 dysplasia, and with a UC disease activity index (UCDAI) score ≤ 1 on mesalamine, were randomized 3:1 in a double-blind phase I trial to berberine 900 mg/day or placebo for 3 months, with the primary objective of assessing safety. Blood samples and biopsies of the colorectum, from prespecified locations, were collected prior to and following therapy. Secondary endpoints included changes in UCDAI score, and in tissue and plasma markers of inflammation. Of toxicities at least possibly related, one episode of grade 3 elevation in transaminases and one episode of grade 1 nausea were observed among 12 individuals on berberine, and none were observed among 4 on placebo. The mean plasma berberine concentration was 3. nM after berberine treatment, significantly higher than 0. nM with placebo. Berberine significantly decreased the Geboes grade in colonic tissue, but had a nonsignificant effect on other tissue or blood biomarkers related to cell growth and inflammation. The combination of berberine and mesalamine is well tolerated in Chinese with UC, and may enhance mesalamine's anti-inflammatory effects in colonic tissue.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659674>Biofilm Formation and Virulence Determinants of Klebsiella oxytoca Clinical Isolates from Patients with Colorectal Cancer.</a></h1><p>Biofilm formation has made the therapy of bacterial infections more difficult. The objective our study was assessment of pan-drug-resistant (PDR) Klebsiella oxytoca pathogenicity and virulence factors causing AAHC in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).Among a total of 300 healthy and 300 patients with antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic  (AAHC) and CRC, 200 K. oxytoca were identified during May 2015-January 2019. The virulence properties and biofilm formation among the isolates were investigated by phenotypic, PCR, and real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) techniques.The bla (20%), bla (11%), bla (33%), and AmpC encoding CIT (2%) ESBL genes, carbapenemase-encoding genes blaIM (4%) and bla (2%), and colistin-resistant mcr-1 gene (2.%) were detected. The virulence-encoding genes including fimA (80%), pilQ (100%), matB (100%), mrkA (80%), and npsB (100%) were amplified. Therefore, PDR K. oxytoca containing adhesins and toxin-encoding genes with ability of biofilm formation causing AAHC and CRC were isolated. There was a significant difference between healthy and patients with CRC regarding the presence of K. oxytoca (p = 00.221).Bacterial enteric pathogens possibly play a role in CRC. Biofilm formation by K. oxytoca strains prevents the efficient infection elimination; therefore, rapid identification and control measure are chief requirements. Additionally, more investigations are necessary with this regard.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562896>Infliximab clinically treating ulcerative : A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>This review aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of infliximab against ulcerative  (UC).Collection of databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, CBM, and CNKI. This meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials comparing infliximab vs. placebo's, steroids, or immunosuppressants.Searching terms were ('infliximab', OR 'anti-tumor necrosis factor', OR 'tumor necrosis factor', OR 'tumor necrosis factor alpha antibody', OR 'tumor necrosis factor antibody', OR 'IFX') and ('ulcerative ' OR 'UC'). Study quality: Independently assessed by two reviewers.Meta-analysis combined the odds ratios (OR).Twenty-two studies (2080 patients) evaluated infliximab therapy in UC, and the patients were randomly assigned into infliximab (1149 cases) and control groups (931 cases). The meta-analysis showed the advantage of infliximab in three endpoints (short/long-term response and long-term remission). The main outcomes considered in this meta-analysis were percentage of response (defined by the authors of each study as partial or complete symptomatic response) and remission (defined by the authors as complete symptomatic response), both at the short-term (the first control performed in the study) and the long-term (the last control performed in the study). Compared to the control group, the infliximab group was significantly more effective (short-term response: OR = 4.01, 95%CI = 3.08-.23, p < 0.00001; long-term response: OR = 3.53, 95%CI = 2.55-4.89, p < 0.00001; long-term remission: OR = 2.80, 95%CI = 1.89-4.14, p < 0.00001; colectomy (3 months): OR = 0.38, 95%CI = 0.19-0.75, P = 0.005; colectomy (12 months): OR = 0.47, 95%CI = 0.33-0.67, p < 0.0001), but there were no significant differences in the short-term remission (OR = 1.88, 95%CI = 0.91-3.86, P = 0.09), and infliximab was notably effective in all the subgroups with different treatment doses (all p < 0.00001). In the comparison of differences in adverse effects there was no obvious difference between the two groups (OR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.48-1.19, P = 0.23).Infliximab is more effective than placebo's, steroids, or immunosuppressants, while the drug safety between the two groups was not obvious.

We found that mean serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with CD were significantly lower than those in healthy controls (MD: - 3.17 ng/mL; 95% CI - 4.42 to - 1.93). Results from the meta-analysis examining 1,25(OH)D levels in Crohn's patients revealed higher levels in the CD group than in healthy (MD: 3.47 pg/mL; 95% CI - 7.72 to 14.66) and UC group (MD: .05 pg/mL; 95% CI - 2.42 to 12.52). Serum 25(OH)D levels were lower in the UC group than in the healthy control group (MD: - 2.52 ng/mL; 95% CI - 4.02 to - 1.02). In studies investigating the level of 1,25(OH)D in UC and healthy control groups, the level of 1,25(OH)D in the UC groups were found to be higher than that in the control groups (MD: 3.76 pg/mL; 95% CI - 8.36 to 15.57). However, the 1,25(OH)D level in patients with UC was lower than that in CD groups (MD: - 6.71 pg/mL; 95% CI - 15.30 to 1.88). No significant difference was noted between CD patients and UC patients in terms of average serum 25(OH)D levels.This study found that VitD levels were inversely related to CD and UC. Serum levels of 25(OH)D were lower in patients with CD and UC than in healthy people, and more than half of the patients had insufficient vitamin D levels.

The aim of this study was to define the characteristics of IBD, the trends and phenotype among IBD patients in Romania.  We conducted a prospective study over a period of 12 years, from 2006 to 2017. All patients diagnosed with IBD on clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological features were included. We divided the country into eight regions: west (W), north-east (NE), north-west (NW), south-east (SE), south-west (SW), south (S), central (C) and Bucharest-Ilfov (B), and data were analyzed accordingly.  A total of 2724 patients were included in this database, but only 2248 were included in the final analysis, with all data available. Of the 2248 patients, 935 were Crohn's disease (CD), 1263 were ulcerative  (UC) and 50 were IBD-undetermined. In UC phenotypes we observed more frequent left-sided  (50.%,  < 0.0001), and in CD phenotype we observed more frequent colonic and ileo-colonic localization (37.8% and 37.6%,  < 0.0001). The region with the most IBD cases was NE (25.1%) and with the least IBD cases was SW (4.9%). UC was found more frequently in NE (32%), while CD was found more frequently in Bucharest (28.6%).  In Romania, ulcerative  is more frequent than CD. UC is predominant in the northern part of Romania, while CD has become predominant in the southern part of the country. IBD occurs more in the male population, and in urban and industrialized areas. There are differences between the regions in Romania regarding IBD phenotypes, gender distributions, age distribution, treatment, smoking status and complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520534>Serotonin exerts a direct modulatory role on bladder afferent firing in mice.</a></h1><p>Functional disorders (i.e. interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome) are associated with hyperexcitability of afferent nerves innervating the urinary tract and the bowel, respectively. Various non--HT receptor mRNA transcripts are expressed in mouse urothelium and exert functional responses to -HT. Whilst -HT receptors were not detected in mouse urothelium, -HT receptors expressed on bladder sensory neurons plays a role in bladder afferent excitability both under normal conditions and in a mouse model of chronic visceral hypersensitivity. These data suggest that the role -HT receptors play in bladder afferent signalling warrants further study as a potential therapeutic target for functional bladder disorders.Serotonin (-HT) is an excitatory mediator that in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a physiological role in gut-brain signalling and is dysregulated in functional GI disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients suffering from IBS frequently suffer from urological symptoms characteristic of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, which manifests due to cross-sensitization of shared innervation pathways between the bladder and colon. However, a direct modulatory role of -HT in bladder afferent signalling and its role in colon-bladder neuronal crosstalk remain elusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the action of -HT on bladder afferent signalling in normal mice and mice with chronic visceral hypersensitivity (CVH) following trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced . Bladder afferent activity was recorded directly using ex vivo afferent nerve recordings. Expression of 14 -HT receptor subtypes, the serotonin transporter (SERT) and -HT-producing enzymes was determined in the urothelium using RT-PCR. Retrograde labelling of bladder-projecting dorsal root ganglion neurons was used to investigate expression of -HT receptors using single cell RT-PCR, while sensory neuronal and urothelial responses to -HT were determined by live cell calcium imaging. -HT elicited bladder afferent firing predominantly via -HT receptors expressed on afferent terminals. CVH animals showed a downregulation of SERT mRNA expression in urothelium, suggesting increased -HT bioavailability. Granisetron, a -HT antagonist, reversed bladder afferent hypersensitivity in CVH mice. These data suggest -HT exerts a direct effect on bladder afferents to enhance signalling. -HT antagonists could therefore be a potential therapeutic target to treat functional bladder and bowel disorders.© 2019 The Authors.

The majority of pediatric cases (90 percent) of HUS are caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC-HUS) or Shigella dysenteriae and rarely with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcal-HUS). Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) constitute only  percent of all HUS cases and are mediated by dysregulation of complement proteins. Supportive therapy is the cornerstone of management of HUS. Atypical HUS on the other hand is amenable to treatment with eculizumab; the first FDA approved complement blocker. We present a case of HUS caused by Clostridium difficile in a 16-year-old pediatric patient which has rarely been mentioned in the literature and is the first reported case successfully treated with eculizumab with rapid and sustained improvement in hematologic and kidney disease.Copyright© South Dakota State Medical Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657260>Corneal Manifestations of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>: To evaluate detailed corneal parameters of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC) patients, and to assess associations between anterior segment values and other clinical variables.: This prospective cross-sectional case-control study at a tertiary referral center included 30 CD patients, 36 UC patients and 80 age- and gender-matched controls with no ocular symptoms or ocular surface disorders. All study participants underwent a comprehensive ophthalmological evaluation with special interest in dry eye disease (DED). Corneal parameters were evaluated by Pentacam.: The mean age of CD patients, UC patients, and controls was 45.80 ± 11.55 years, 52.00 ± 16.05, and 50.68 ± 14.62, respectively. The average disease duration was 12.72 ± .83 years for CD patients and 15.94 ± 10.09 years for UC patients. All pachymetric (center, apex and thinnest) and corneal volume (CV) measurements were significantly decreased, while anterior chamber angle width (ACA) values were significantly increased on both sides in all IBD patients compared to those in controls ( < .05). In addition, several anterior segment parameters were altered unilaterally in CD or UC patients. Negative correlations were found between corneal parameters and Schirmer I test values.: Our investigations suggest that IBD patients have thinner corneas compared to that of controls. The coexistence of reduced tear quantity seems to have an additional impact on the thinning of the cornea in IBD patients. Early recognition of corneal impairments, a possible extraintestinal manifestation of IBD, should be included in the disease checkup to reduce vision-threatening developments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515764>Clinical profile and outcome of primary sclerosing cholangitis: A single-centre experience from western India.</a></h1><p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic progressive cholestatic liver disease of unknown cause, is uncommon in India. The aim of this study was to define the profile and outcomes of patients with PSC in a tertiary centre from western India.A retrospective study of the prospectively maintained liver clinic database was searched for cases of PSC between January 2008 and December 2017 with minimum 6 months follow up. All cases were reviewed for clinical profile, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) co-morbidity and major endpoints like death, cholangiocarcinoma and liver transplantation (LT).We identified 28 (18 men) patients with PSC (19, 67% large-duct and 9, 33% small-duct) with a median age of 31. years (range 7-63 years) with median duration of follow up of 24 months (6-125 months). Six (21.4%) had autoimmune hepatitis (AIH-PSC) overlap. Inflammatory bowel disease was seen in 12 (43%) cases, all were ulcerative  (UC). During follow up, seven patients (25%) developed dominant stricture or recurrent cholangitis, 11 (39%) had  portal hypertension, 2 (7%) developed cholangiocarcinoma and  (17.8%) progressed to hepatic  decompensation on follow up. Ten (35%) patients died,  from liver-related complications, 2 from cholangiocarcinoma, 1 each from brain hemorrhage and systemic sepsis and 1 due to unknown cause; 3 underwent liver transplantation. Revised Mayo score of patients who survived was lower than those who died (1.03 vs. 1.86, p value 0.03).PSC commonly presents in young age and rapidly progresses to decompensation. Prevalence of IBD in PSC is lower and the proportion of small-duct PSC is higher than that observed in western populations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613959>Cannabis for the Treatment of Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative : Evidence From Cochrane Reviews.</a></h1><p>We systematically reviewed the safety and effectiveness of cannabis and cannabinoids treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC).MEDLINE, Embase, WHO ICTRP, AMED, PsychINFO, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.Gov, and the European Clinical Trials Register were searched for relevant studies.Five randomized controlled trials (3 CD and 2 UC studies, 185 participants) were included. One CD study (N = 21) showed 45% ( of 11) of the cannabis cigarette group experienced clinical remission compared with 10% (1 of 10) of the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] 4.55; 95% CI, 0.63-32.56). Another CD study (N = 19) did not show significant rates of clinical remission. Forty percent (4 of 10) of participants in the cannabis oil group experienced remission compared with 33% (3 of 9) of the placebo group (RR 1.20; 95% CI, 0.36-3.97). A UC study (N = 60) did not have significant clinical remission rates. Twenty-four percent (7 of 29) of cannabis oil participants experienced remission compared with 26% (8 of 31) of placebo participants (RR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.39-2.25). A second UC study (N = 32) showed the effects on disease activity, C-reactive protein levels, and fecal calprotectin levels were uncertain. Adverse events were more prevalent in the cannabis groups for both CD and UC studies. GRADE analysis for the UC and CD studies ranged from very low to moderate.In summary, no firm conclusions can be made regarding the safety and effectiveness of cannabis and cannabinoids in adults with CD and UC.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Surgical best practices have been largely based on single-institution results and meta-analyses, with multicenter clinical data lacking. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) has revolutionized the way in which large-volume surgical outcomes data have been collected. Our aim was to employ the ACS-NSQIP to collect disease-specific variables relevant to surgical outcomes in IBD.A collaborative of 13 high-volume IBD surgery centers was convened to collect  IBD-specific variables in NSQIP. Variables included biologic and immunomodulator medications usage, ileostomy utilization, ileal pouch anastomotic technique, and colonic dysplasia/neoplasia. A sample of the Surgical Clinical Reviewer collected data was validated by a colorectal surgeon at each institution, and kappa's agreement statistics generated.Over 1 year, data were collected on a total of 956 cases. Overall, 41.4% of patients had taken a biologic agent in the 60 days before surgery. The 2 most commonly performed procedures were laparoscopic ileocolic resections (159 cases) and subtotal colectomies (151 cases). Overall, 56.8% of cases employed an ileostomy, and 134 ileal pouches were constructed, of which 92.4% used stapled technique. A sample of 214 (22.4%) consecutive cases was validated from 8 institutions. All  novel variables were shown to be reliably collected, with excellent agreement for 4 variables (kappa ≥ 0.70) and very good agreement for the presence of colonic dysplasia (kappa = 0.68).We report the results of the initial year of implementation of the first disease-specific collaborative within NSQIP.

It is challenging to find an absolute treatment and current therapy aims to ameliorate symptoms, decrease relapses and prevent prognosis of colorectal cancer. In the present study, we investigated the possible action of xanthine oxidase inhibitors in murine  model by measuring different indicative parameters and comparing the results to those of the reference sulfasalazine. Also, we compared the effects of combining sulfasalazine and allopurinol to each drug alone. Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) is used in this study to induce ulcerative  in male wistar rats as it is known to be the closest model that mimics human ulcerative . Allopurinol was given prior to  induction by four days and febuxostat for six days before induction with DSS (% w/v) and continue to give them concomitantly during the induction.Il-1β, malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione (GSH), xanthine oxidase, and superoxide dismutase were measured in colonic tissue. We also measured concentrations of IL-1β, Il-6 and uric acid in serum.Allopurinol dose-dependently ameliorated biochemical injuries. Febuxostat has shown better results than allopurinol and sulfasalazine, and this is the first study to demonstrate this.Copyright © 2019.

The role of endoscopists, pathologists, and patients are investigated. Colorectal cancer is linked to poor compliance with therapy, and attention may be better directed at improving adherence to treatment than strengthening current surveillance programs. Clearly, -ASA compounds, particularly mesalazine, are the most appropriate agents to choose, but there may also be a place for the daily intake of folic acid. Currently, the evidence in support of ursodeoxycholic acid is mixed, and it cannot be recommended, in general, to patients for the prophylaxis of colorectal cancer risk. An alternative approach through better concordance with medications is considered. The situation in Crohn's  is less clear. Although the risk of colorectal cancer mirrors that in ulcerative , there are no published community-based studies that exclusively assess the effects of surveillance on the early detection of cancer, and the benefits of -ASA compounds in treatment seem less certain than in ulcerative . In addition, there have been no assessments of the effects of any medications on cancer risk in Crohn's disease.© 2019 The Authors.

In a melanoma patient in whom programmed-death 1 (PD-1) blockade resulted in organ rejection and , the addition of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus resulted in ongoing anti-tumor efficacy while promoting allograft tolerance. Strong granzyme B, interferon (IFN)-γ CD8 cytotoxic T cell and circulating regulatory T (T) cell responses were noted during allograft rejection, along with significant eosinophilia and elevated serum IL- and eotaxin levels. Co-treatment with sirolimus abated cytotoxic T cell numbers and eosinophilia, while elevated T cell numbers in the peripheral blood were maintained. Interestingly, numbers of IFN-γ CD4 T cells and serum IFN-γ levels increased with the addition of sirolimus treatment likely promoting ongoing anti-PD-1 efficacy. Thus, our results indicate that sirolimus has the potential to uncouple anti-PD-1 therapy toxicity and efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599001>Venous thromboembolic events in the tofacitinib ulcerative  clinical development programme.</a></h1><p>Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule JAK inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative  (UC).To report incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in the tofacitinib UC programme.DVT and PE were evaluated from one phase 2 and two phase 3 induction studies, one phase 3 maintenance study and an ongoing, open-label, long-term extension (OLE) study (September 2018 datacut). Data were analysed in induction, maintenance and overall (patients receiving ≥ 1 dose of tofacitinib  or 10 mg b.d. in any phase 2, 3 or OLE study) cohorts.1157 patients (2404 patient-years' exposure; ≤ 6.1 years' tofacitinib treatment) were evaluated in the overall cohort. In induction, one placebo-treated patient had DVT and one had PE; no tofacitinib-treated patients had DVT/PE. In maintenance, one placebo-treated patient had DVT and one had PE; no tofacitinib-treated patients had DVT/PE. In the overall cohort, one patient had DVT (incidence rate [patients with events/100 patient-years; 95% CI]: 0.04 [0.00-0.23]); four had PE (0.16 [0.04-0.41]); all received predominant dose tofacitinib 10 mg b.d.; all had venous thromboembolism risk factors alongside UC.In this post hoc analysis of patients with UC, during tofacitinib exposure, one patient had DVT and four had PE, all during the OLE study, on predominant dose 10 mg b.d.

Although the pathogenesis of CCA in PSC is largely unknown, inflammation-driven carcinogenesis concomitant with various genetic and epigenetic abnormalities are underlying factors. The majority of CCA cases develop from a dominant stricture (DS), which is defined as a stricture with a diameter < 1. mm in the common bile duct or < 1.0 mm in the hepatic duct. In PSC patients presenting with an abrupt aggravation of jaundice, pain, fatigue, pruritus, weight loss, or worsening liver biochemistries, CCA should be suspected and evaluated utilizing a variety of diagnostic modalities. However, early recognition of CCA in PSC remains a major challenge. Importantly, 30-50% of CCA in PSC patients are observed within the first year following the diagnosis of PSC followed by an annual incidence ranging from 0. to 1. per 100 persons, which is nearly 10 to 1000 times higher than that in the general population. Cumulative -year, 10-year, and lifetime incidences are 7%, 8-11%, and 9-20%, respectively. When PSC-associated CCA is diagnosed, most tumors are unresectable, and no effective medications are available. Given the poor therapeutic outcome, the surveillance and management of PSC patients who are at an increased risk of developing CCA are of importance. Such patients include older males with large-duct PSC and possibly concurrent ulcerative . Thus, more attention should be paid to patients with these clinical features, in particular within the first year after PSC diagnosis. In contrast, CCA is less frequently observed in pediatric or female PSC patients or in those with small-duct PSC or concurrent Crohn's disease. Recently, new biomarkers such as antibodies to glycoprotein 2 have been found to be associated with an increased risk of developing CCA in PSC. Herein, we review the literature on the pathogenesis, incidence, clinical features, and risk factors, with a focus on various diagnostic modalities of PSC-associated CCA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648810>Limitations of the determination of faecal calprotectin in patients with ulcerative  and inflammatory polyps.</a></h1><p>Faecal calprotectin is a useful technique for detecting activity in patients with ulcerative . However, there may be high levels due to factors other than the activity of ulcerative . Our aim was to analyse possible false positive results of calprotectin for the activity of ulcerative  owing to the presence of inflammatory polyps.Retrospective, observational, descriptive study. Data was collected from patients monitored for 2 years in whom a colonoscopy had been requested within 3 months after detecting high calprotectin values (>150μg/g) and before modifying the treatment.We reviewed 39 patients and in  of them, with previous diagnosis of extensive ulcerative , inflammatory polyps were detected. Three patients were on treatment with mesalazine, one with azathioprine and other with infliximab. All of them were asymptomatic and the endoscopy did not show macroscopic activity (endoscopic Mayo score=0) or histological activity. The median values of calprotectin were 422μg/g (IQR: 298-2,408) and they remained elevated in a second measurement. In 4 of the patients the inflammatory polyps were multiple and small in size. The other patient had a polyp measuring 4cm.In clinical practice we can find high faecal calprotectin levels not due to the presence of ulcerative  activity, but due to other lesions such as inflammatory polyps. This fact must be taken into account before carrying out relevant changes such as step-up therapy to immunosuppressive drugs or biological drugs in patients with confirmed high calprotectin levels.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

Colonic biopsies from all patients were reviewed by a group of 4 gastrointestinal pathologist experts to assess the diagnosis of CC or LC. Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively collected from diagnosis to February 28, 2017.One hundred thirty cases of MC, 87 CC and 43 LC, were included (median age at diagnosis: 70 [interquartile range, 61-77] and 48 [IQR, 40-61] years, respectively). The median follow-up was 9.6 years (7.6; 10.6). By the end of the follow-up, 37 patients (28%) relapsed after a median time of 3.9 years (1.2; .0) since diagnosis, without significant difference between CC and LC (30% vs 26%; P = 0.47). Twenty patients (15%) were hospitalized for a disease flare, and 32 patients (25%) presented another autoimmune disease. Budesonide was the most widely used treatment (n = 74, 59%), followed by -aminosalicylic acid (n = 31, 25%). The median duration of budesonide treatment was 92 days (70; 168), and no adverse event to budesonide was reported. Sixteen patients (22%) developed steroid dependency and 4 (%) were corticoresistant. No difference in the risk of digestive and extradigestive cancer was observed compared with the general population. None of the death (n = 25) observed during the follow-up were linked to MC. In multivariate analysis, age at diagnosis (HR, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.06; P = 0.02) and budesonide exposure (HR, 2.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-.55; P = 0.03) were significantly associated with relapse.This population-based study showed that after diagnosis, two-third of the patients with MC observed long-term clinical remission.

Patients with cancer are at increased risk of complications and hospitalizations from influenza; therefore, it is recommended that they receive inactivated influenza vaccination. However, efficacy and safety of inactivated influenza vaccination in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors is uncertain. The objective of this prospective case series was to evaluate the incidence of immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs) following inactivated influenza vaccination in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors. Changes in cytokine and chemokine levels were also evaluated.Patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors during the 2017-2018 influenza season were eligible for study participation. Peripheral blood samples were collected prior to administration of inactivated influenza vaccine and two post-vaccination time points. Evaluation of new or worsening imAEs occurred via patient questionnaire and review of medical records for 60 days following inactivated influenza vaccination. Baseline imAEs were evaluated from review of medical records for 60 days prior to inactivated influenza vaccination. Serum cytokines and chemokines were measured using a multiplex Luminex assay.Twenty-four patients were enrolled in this study. Seven patients experienced any grade imAE (one patient having 2) within 60 days following inactivated influenza vaccination. The majority were Grades 1-2, including rash ( = 3), hypothyroidism, myalgia, and  ( = 1 each). Two patients experienced severe imAEs (grade 3 nephritis and grade 4 diabetes). No significant changes ( > 0.05) in serum cytokine or chemokine concentrations were observed.Although small, our study suggests that inactivated influenza vaccine may be safely administered to patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors. The majority of imAEs following inactivated influenza vaccination were Grades 1-2 and did not require changes in immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534619>Sesamin Enhances Nrf2-Mediated Protective Defense against Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in  via AKT and ERK Activation.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative  (UC) is a major form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with high incidence and prevalence in many countries. Patients with UC usually suffer from a lifetime of debilitating physical symptoms. Therefore, developing effective therapeutic strategy that can manage this disease better and improve patients' life quality is in urgent need. Sesamin (SSM) is a lignan derived from sesame seeds. In this study, the protective effect of SSM against UC and the underlying mechanism were investigated  and . Our data showed that SSM protected Caco-2 cells from HO-induced oxidative stress injury via GSH-mediated scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was significantly increased by SSM, and the ability of SSM to activate Nrf2-targeted genes was further confirmed in Caco-2 cells using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In contrast, Nrf2 knockdown abolished the protective effect of SSM. Additionally, we found that SSM also activated advanced protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in Caco-2 cells, while either AKT or ERK inhibition can prevent SSM-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, SSM displayed a better protective effect against dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced UC compared with -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) in C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced Nrf2 signaling and activated AKT/ERK were also observed in the colon of mice after SSM administration. These results first demonstrate the protective effect of SSM against UC and indicate that the effect is associated with AKT/ERK activation and subsequent Nrf2 signaling enhancement. This study provides a new insight into the medicinal value of SSM and proposes it as a new natural nutrition for better managing the symptoms of UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504527>Application of Herbaceous Medications for Inflammatory Bowel Disease as a Complementary and Alternative Therapy.</a></h1><p>Conventional medicine for the treatment of IBD is prevailingly composed of sulfadiazine, -aminosalicylic acid, glucocorticoid, and immunosuppressants, which have the merits of alleviating intestine inflammation, but long-term use of these drugs may cause toxic side effects; additionally, these drugs may be expensive. In the pursuit of novel and more economic therapies, patients may increasingly look at complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Recently, CAM is increasingly favored by the general public on account of its safety, low toxicity, and effectiveness. As a branch of CAM, herbal plants and their extracts have a significant effect on the treatment of IBD. Treatment of IBD with herbaceous plants has been reported, but specific mechanisms and effects have not yet been elaborated.English abstracts were identified in PubMed and Science Direct by multiple search terms, such as "herbal," "CAM," "IBD," "ulcerative ," "abdominal pain," and so on. Full-length articles were selected for review.Herbaceous plants and their extracts have been shown to be effective against IBD in many studies, and herbaceous plants may be effective in treating symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, mucus, and bloody stools.Herbal medications could be used as a complementary and alternative treatment for IBD, but they require more rigorous scientific testing.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Flightless I (Flii) is an immuno-modulatory protein is a member of the gelsolin family of actin-remodelling proteins that regulates cellular and inflammatory processes critical in tissue repair. Here we investigated its involvement in UC and show that Flii is significantly elevated in colonic tissues of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Using an acute murine model of , we characterised the contribution of Flii to UC using mice with low (Flii), normal (Flii) and high Flii (Flii). High levels of Flii resulted in significantly elevated disease severity index scores, increased rectal bleeding and degree of colon shortening whereas, low Flii expression decreased disease severity, reduced tissue inflammation and improved clinical indicators of UC. Mice with high levels of Flii had significantly increased histological disease severity and elevated mucosal damage with significantly increased inflammatory cell infiltrate and significantly higher levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL- and IL-13 pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, Flii overexpression resulted in decreased β-catenin levels, inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signalling and impaired regeneration of colonic crypts. These studies suggest that high levels of Flii, as is observed in patients with UC, may adversely affect mucosal healing via mechanisms involving Th and Th mediated tissue inflammation and Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602515>Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) for rectal cancer: beyond the learning curve.</a></h1><p>Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) is a surgical approach for low rectal cancer with a learning curve estimated at 40-50 cases. The experience among taTME surgeons beyond their learning curve is limited.A retrospective analysis of all taTME cases performed for rectal cancer at two tertiary care hospitals from 2014 to 2019 was conducted. Transanal surgeons had previously performed > 50 taTME cases. Demographic, perioperative, and short-term outcomes were analyzed.Among 54 taTME patients, 74.1% were male and 27.8% had a BMI ≥ 30. Tumors were stage I (8), II (13), III (29), and IV (4). Complex cases included 4 local recurrences, 4 prior liver resections, and 2 with prior prostate cancer. Thirty tumors were located ≤ 6 cm from the anal verge. On staging MRI, 12 had a positive predicted circumferential radial margin (+CRM), and 4 had internal anal sphincter involvement (+IAS). Forty-seven patients received neoadjuvant therapy. A 2-team approach was used in 51 patients with laparoscopic (83.3%) or robotic (16.7%) abdominal assistance with a 9.2% conversion rate. Low anterior resection with sphincter salvage was achieved in 87% with 8 patients requiring intersphincteric resection. Anastomoses were hand-sewn in 57.4% and all patients were diverted. Median LOS was  days with a 42.6% 30-day morbidity rate and 3 postoperative mortalities (ARDS, pulmonary embolism and pseudomembranous ). Complete and near complete TME grade was achieved in 94.4% with a 3.7% rate of +CRM. At a median follow-up of 28 months, local and distant recurrence rates were 3.9% and 17.6%, respectively, with no cancer-related mortality.Indications for taTME at experienced centers have expanded to include complex reoperative cases, local recurrences, metastatic cancer, and tumors with threatened CRM or IAS with evidence of post-treatment tumor regression. In the latter cases, taTME achieves good short-term outcomes and may facilitate R0 resection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467484>Treatment with a Zinc Metalloprotease Purified from  Snake Venom (BmooMP-Alpha-I) Reduces the Inflammation in an Experimental Model of Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced .</a></h1><p>It has been described that the metalloprotease BmooMP-alpha-I purified from  snake venom is able to hydrolyze the TNF molecule. However, this observation has been based mainly on  investigation, in addition to molecular modeling and docking approaches. Considering that there is no in vivo study to demonstrate the biological effects of this enzyme, the major aim to the present work was to investigate whether the BmooMP-alpha-I has any anti-inflammatory efficacy by setting up a murine experimental design of  induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). For this purpose, C57BL/6 mice were divided into six groups, as follows: (i) animals without intestinal inflammation, (ii) animals without intestinal inflammation treated with BmooMP-alpha-I (50 g/animal/day), and (iii) animals with intestinal inflammation induced by 3% of DSS, (iv) mice with intestinal inflammation induced by DSS and treated with BmooMP-alpha-I enzyme at the 50, 25, or 12. g/animal/day dosages by intraperitoneal route. Clinical signs of  were observed daily for calculating the morbidity scores, cytokine measurements, and histological features. We observed that the animals treated with different doses of the enzyme presented a remarkable improvement of  signs, as confirmed by a significant increase of the intestine length in comparison to the DSS group. Also, no difference was observed between the groups treated with the enzyme or vehicle, as the colon length of these animals was slightly lower than that of the group of healthy animals, without induction of intestinal inflammation. The cytokine quantification in supernatants of intestinal tissue homogenates showed a significant reduction of 38% in IFN-gamma levels, when the animals were treated with 50 g of the BmooMP-alpha-I compared to the animals receiving DSS only. A significant reduction of 39% in TNF levels was also observed in all doses of treatment with BmooMP-alpha-I, in addition to a significant reduction of 35% in the amount of IL-12p40. Histological examinations revealed that the BmooMP-alpha-I 50 g treated group preserved colon architecture and goblet cells and reduced the ulcer area, when compared with DSS mice, which showed typical inflammatory changes in tissue architecture, such as ulceration, crypt dilation, loss of tissue architecture, and goblet cell depletion, accompanied by a significant cell infiltration. In conclusion, our results suggest that the improvement of clinical scores and histological findings related to BmooMP-alpha-I treatment in this experimental model could be attributed to the metalloprotease ability to modulate cytokine production locally at the inflamed intestine. These findings highlight the potential anti-inflammatory role and effectiveness of this enzyme as a therapeutic alternative in this type of immunopathological condition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501701>Isolated caecal necrosis-a case study.</a></h1><p>A patient with right iliac fossa pain underwent CT angiography which demonstrated isolated caecal necrosis with associated superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.

Nonetheless, there has been no effort to delineate the biological and phytochemical profiles of leaves and flowers prepared by different extractive solvents (ethyl acetate, methanol (MeOH), and water). The pharmacological potential of O. americanum extracts on pro-oxidant/pro-inflammatory mediators in rat colon specimens treated with lipopolysaccharide was investigated. In parallel, the inhibitory effects of the extracts on fungal and bacterial strains involved in ulcerative  were studied. Qualitative phytochemical analysis showed the presence of phenols, flavonoids, and tannins. Water extracts of flowers and leaves showed strong reducing and radicals scavenging potential. Both MeOH and ethyl acetate extracts of the leaves and flowers were able to inhibit acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and tyrosinase. All the extracts inhibited the selected bacterial and fungal strains, while only ethyl acetate flower extract displayed antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects in rat colon. The water and MeOH extracts stimulated colon lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serotonin (-HT) and induced spontaneous migration of HCT116 cells.

Several stool neutrophil-related proteins are currently used as biomarkers for MH. However, the sensitivity and specificity are not sufficient to avoid unnecessary endoscopic evaluations.Novel serum neutrophil-related markers (neutrophil gelatinase B-associated lipocalin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 [NGAL-MMP-9 complex], cathelicidin LL-37 and chitinase 3-like 1 [CHI3L1]), together with C-reactive protein [CRP] and neutrophil counts were studied. Serum samples were obtained from 176 anti-tumour necrosis factor [anti-TNF]-treated UC patients (145 infliximab [IFX] and 31 adalimumab [ADM]) at baseline and after a median of 9. weeks. All patients had active disease prior to treatment (Mayo endoscopic subscore [MES] ≥ 2), and MH was defined as MES ≤ 1. Serum was also obtained from 75 healthy controls. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to generate the Ulcerative  Response Index [UCRI]. The performance of individual markers and UCRI was tested with receiver operating characteristic analysis.All neutrophil-related markers were significantly higher in active UC patients compared to healthy controls. In the IFX cohort, CRP, NGAL-MMP-9, CHI3L1 and neutrophil count decreased significantly after treatment and all marker levels were significantly lower in healers compared to non-healers following IFX. In the ADM cohort, CRP, NGAL-MMP-9, CHI3L1 and neutrophil count decreased significantly only in healers. UCRI [including CRP, CHI3L1, neutrophil count and LL-37] accurately detected MH in both IFX-treated (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.83) and ADM-treated [AUC = 0.79] patients.The new UCRI index accurately detects MH after treatment with IFX and ADM. This panel is useful for monitoring MH in UC patients under anti-TNF treatment.This article has an associated podcast which can be accessed at https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/pages/podcast.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

The lack of effective and safe therapeutic agents led to the identification of new therapeutic agents to effectively manage the symptoms and complications of ulcerative . The present study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of sodium benzoate in acetic acid-induced ulcerative  in rats. Methods Infusion of 3% acetic acid in the colon through the rectum was done to construct a rat model of ulcerative . After  days of infusion, macroscopic, biochemical, and histopathological examinations and disease activity scoring of the colon were done to assess colonic damage. Results Acetic acid infusion resulted in severe inflammation in the colon assessed macroscopically and histopathologically. Moreover, it also led to increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) and reduction in glutathione (GSH) levels. In the present study, repeated administration of sodium benzoate (400 and 800 mg/kg i.p.) and sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg orally) for 7 days, i.e. 2 days before and continued for  days after acetic acid infusion, significantly attenuated macroscopic damage and disease activity score as compared to disease control. Further, it also significantly reduced the levels of MPO and enhanced colonic levels of reduced GSH. However, the lower dose of sodium benzoate (200 mg/kg) did not show sufficient protective effect in acetic acid-induced ulcerative . Further, sodium benzoate per se did not show any effect in normal rats. Conclusions The observed protective effect of sodium benzoate may be due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in an ulcerative  model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621721>Intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei A.

Xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei) is a cactus of the Caatinga family that has been used by the local population for food and medicinal purposes. The intestinal anti-inflammatory effect of xique-xique cladode juice was evaluated in the present study. A dose of  mL kg-1 had a protective effect on intestinal inflammation, with an improvement in macroscopic damage, and a decrease in pro-inflammatory markers and oxidative stress, in addition to preserving the colonic tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the downregulation of IL-17, NF-κB, and iNOS, and upregulation of SOCs-1, ZO-1, and MUC-2. These protective effects could be attributed to the phenolic compounds as well as the fibers present in xique-xique juice. Further studies are needed before suggesting the use of xique-xique juice as a new alternative for treating IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633443>Comparative pharmacokinetics of verapamil and norverapamil in normal and ulcerative  rats after oral administration of low and high dose verapamil by UPLC-MS/MS.</a></h1><p>In this study, UC rat model was established by administration of % (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium, and the pharmacokinetics of verapamil and norverapamil were evaluated in normal and UC rats using UPLC-MS/MS after oral administration of  mg/kg and 50 mg/kg verapamil.The peak concentration (C) and the area under plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) of verapamil in UC rats after oral administration of  mg/kg were significantly greater (2. times and 2 times, respectively) than those in normal rats, but the clearance rate (Cl) was significantly lower (by 50%). For norverapamil, C and AUC were significantly greater (2.8 times and 2. times, respectively), and Cl was significantly lower (by 45%). But, pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil and norverapamil after oral administration of 50 mg/kg were no significant differences between UC and normal rats.The better absorption and poor excretion for low-dose verapamil may be attributed to down-regulation of P-gp expression in the intestine and kidney. No significant differences of pharmacokinetic parameters for high-dose verapamil may be explained as the saturation of an efflux mechanism.The findings of this study suggested that in UC patients, doses of verapamil should be decreased when low-dose verapamil was orally administrated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454474>Development of Leiomyosarcoma in a Patient Treated with Azathioprine.</a></h1><p>Cirrhosis resulting from autoimmune hepatitis is associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. A common treatment for autoimmune hepatitis, azathioprine, is also associated with the development of many other cancers, predominantly lymphomas. The strongest association is seen for post-transplant lymphoma and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in Crohn's disease and ulcerative  patients; there is also an association with a variety of cutaneous malignancies. A relationship between azathioprine and sarcoma has not been demonstrated, though there have been sporadic case reports.

Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest a close relationship between IBD and depression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619080>Synthesis, activity and mechanism of alkoxy-, carbamato-, sulfonamido-, thioureido-, and ureido-derivatives of 2,4,-trimethylpyridin-3-ol against inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic immuno-inflammation in gastrointestinal tract.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease who initiated immunosuppressants or biologic agents, or both, to control inflammatory activity were recruited consecutively. Data on the effects on disease activity (using clinical indexes) and quality-adjusted life-years (using the EuroQol  dimensions questionnaire) were collected. We calculated the costs of health care, equipment, and patients' productivity and social activity impairment. We compared the mean costs per patient, utilities, and bootstrapped differences.We included 63 patients (21 patients per group). TECCU saved €1005 (US $1100) per additional patient in remission compared with G_control (95% CI €-13,518 to 3137; US $-14,798 to 3434), with a 79.96% probability of being more effective at lower costs. Compared with G_NT, TECCU saved €2250 (US $2463) per additional patient in remission (95% CI €-15,363 to 11,086; US $-16,817 to 12,135), and G_NT saved €538 (US $589) compared with G_control (95% CI €-6475 to 5303; US $-7088 to 5805). G_TECCU and G_NT showed an 84% and 67% probability, respectively, of producing a cost saving per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with G_control, considering those simulations that involved negative incremental QALYs as well.There is a high probability that the TECCU Web platform is more cost-effective than standard and telephone care in the short term.

Thus, this study aimed to identify whether histological inflammation at the resection margins after an ileocaecal resection influences endoscopic recurrence.We have prospectively followed up patients with CD who underwent ileocaecal resection at our hospital between January 2012 and January 2018. The specimens were histologically analysed for inflammation at both of the resection margins (ileal and colonic). We evaluated whether histological results of the resection margins are correlated with endoscopic recurrence of CD based on colonoscopy 6 months after ileocaecal resection. Secondary, we assessed the influence of known risk factors and preoperative therapy on endoscopic recurrence of CD.A total of 107 patients were included in our study. Six months after ileocaecal resection, 23 patients (21. %) had an endoscopic recurrence of CD. The histological signs of CD at the resection margins were associated with a higher endoscopic recurrence (56. % versus 4.8 %, p < 0.001). Disease duration from diagnosis to surgery (p = 0.006) and the length of the resected bowel (p = 0.019) were significantly longer in patients with endoscopic recurrence. Smoking was also proved to be a risk factor for endoscopic recurrence (p = 0.028).Histological inflammation at the resection margins was significantly associated with a higher risk of early postoperative endoscopic recurrence after an ileocaecal resection for CD.© European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667589>Comparison of long-term outcomes of primary and redo IPAA for patients with Crohn's disease.</a></h1><p>Crohn's disease (CD) patients after ileal anal pouch anastomosis (IPAA) are subject to CD recurrence, septic complications, and pouch failure. The aim of this study was to compare long-term outcomes of index and redo IPAA for CD.Patients who underwent index and redo IPAA with a diagnosis of CD  were identified from a prospectively maintained IPAA database. Charts were reviewed to determine complications and pouch failure rates after index and redo IPAA. Long-term pouch survival and quality of life (QoL) were compared between index and redo IPAAs.There were 305 patients, 253 with an index IPAA and 52 having a redo IPAA. Their median ages were 33 years (index IPAA) and 32 years (redo IPAA) (p = 0.91); there were 47% and 53% men in each group, respectively (p = 0.54). Pouch salvage with redo IPAA was possible in 75% of redo pouches. Biologic agents were given in 8% of index IPAA and 34% redo IPAA patients (p < 0.01). Cumulative Kaplan Meier -year pouch survival was 80% vs. 60% in index and redo IPAA (p < 0.0001), at 10 years 74% vs. 38%, respectively (p < 0.0001). When queried, 78% who underwent redo pouch surgery would have it again and 86% would recommend this surgery to others.IPAA can be offered to selected patients with isolated colonic CD. Failure in this group of patients is related mainly to recurrent CD, not surgical complications. Redo IPAA is a realistic option for salvage in certain patients with failed index IPAA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607268>Infliximab for pediatric patients with ulcerative : a phase 3, open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter trial in Japan.</a></h1><p>Pediatric ulcerative  (UC) is typically more extensive and has a more active disease course than adult UC, and requires early treatment augmentation to achieve and maintain disease remission. The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile of infliximab (IFX) in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe UC and inadequate response to existing treatment.This open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter, Phase 3 trial was conducted at 17 centers in Japan between April 2012 and September 2014. Pediatric patients (aged 6-17 years) diagnosed with moderate-to-severe UC received a treatment protocol comprising  mg/kg IFX at Weeks 0, 2, and 6, and Clinical Activity Index (CAI)-based responders at Week 8 also received treatment at 8-week intervals at Weeks 14 and 22, with a final evaluation at Week 30.A total of 21 patients were treated in this study. IFX therapy rapidly improved clinical symptoms, and this effect was maintained for up to 30 weeks. Overall CAI-based remission rate was 42.9% and overall Pediatric Ulcerative  Activity Index (PUCAI)-based remission rate was 19.0%. Median partial Mayo score was 6.0 at baseline and 4.0 at Week 30 (overall). Among the eight patients who underwent sigmoidoscopy, Mayo response was achieved at Week 30 (overall) in three patients (37.%). Trough serum IFX concentrations in Week 8 CAI-based responders were maintained throughout the study period. Adverse events and serious adverse events were observed in 95.2 and 14.3% of patients, respectively.These results support the use of IFX in the treatment of pediatric patients with UC with inadequate response to existing treatment.ClinicalTrials.gov, registration number:  .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626701>Unique Phenotypic Characteristics and Clinical Course in Patients With Ulcerative  and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: A Multicenter US Experience.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative  (UC) associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare phenotype. We aimed to assess patients with UC-PSC or UC alone and describe differences in clinical and phenotypic characteristics, antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, and long-term clinical outcomes.This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients who received a diagnosis of UC from 1962 through 2015. We evaluated clinical factors associated with UC-PSC vs UC alone and assessed associations by using multivariable logistic regression models.Among 522 patients with UC, 56 (10.7%) had PSC. Compared with UC alone, patients with UC-PSC were younger (younger than 20 years) at diagnosis (odds ratios [OR], 2.35; adjusted P = 0.02) and had milder UC severity (adjusted P = 0.05), despite having pancolonic involvement (OR, 7.01; adjusted P < 0.001). In the biologics era (calendar year 2005 to 2015), patients with UC-PSC less commonly received anti-TNF therapy compared with patients with UC (OR, 0.38; adjusted P = 0.009), but their response rates were similar. Fewer patients with UC-PSC received corticosteroids (OR, 0.24; adjusted P = 0.005) or rectal -aminosalicyte acid (OR, 0.26; adjusted P < 0.001). Other differences were identified that were not statistically significant in a multivariable model: patients with UC-PSC more commonly were male, had lower rates of smoking, and had higher rates of colorectal cancer and colectomy.This study identified a unique phenotype of UC with concurrent PSC, which had different clinical behavior compared with UC only. These phenotypic characteristics can help identify high-risk patients with UC before PSC is diagnosed and guide different management and monitoring strategies.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Previous study indicated that Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides (DOPS) can regulate immune responses and inflammation to alleviate experimental . However, it remains largely unknown whether DOPS can suppress AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer (CRC) model through its direct impact on intestinal barrier function and intestinal mucosal immunity. Here, we demonstrated the therapeutic action of DOPS for CRC model and further illustrated its underlying mechanisms. Treatment with -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) and DOPS significantly improved the clinical signs and symptoms of chronic , relieve colon damage, suppress the formation and growth of colon tumor in CRC mice. Moreover, administration of DOPS effectively preserved the intestinal barrier function via reducing the loss of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in adjacent tissues and carcinomatous tissues. Further studies demonstrated that DOPS improved the metabolic ability of tumor infiltrated CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and reduced the expression of PD-1 on CTLs to enhance the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironments (TME). Together, the conclusions indicated that DOPS restore intestinal barrier function and enhance intestinal anti-tumor immune response to suppress CRC, which may be a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of CRC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Children who received conventional therapy (including -aminosalicylates, steroids, thiopurines and methotrexate) since diagnosis were included. Primary outcome was steroid-free clinical remission without need for rescue therapy (biologics or surgery) at 6 and 12 months after diagnosis and at last follow-up. Cox proportional hazard modelling was performed to determine variables at diagnosis associated with outcomes.In total, 176 IBD patients (121 CD, 55 UC) were identified with a median follow-up of 4.6 [2.0-8.1] years. Remission rates were 79.6% at month 6, but decreased to 60.2% at month 12, and 31.8% at last follow-up. Higher CRP [1.006 (1.001-1.011)], lower albumin [1.050 (1.012-1.086)] and growth impairment [1.214 (1.014-1.373)] in CD patients and higher PUCAI score [1.038 (1.006-1.072)] and low iron [1.023 (1.003-1.043)] in UC patients were associated with treatment failure (all p < 0.05).Only 32% pediatric IBD patients will remain free of biologics or surgery -years after diagnosis. Especially children with a high disease burden at diagnosis were more likely to fail conventional therapy.Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p></html>
