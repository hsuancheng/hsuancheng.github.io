Here we sought to explore the role of macrophage low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 during regression of atherosclerosis since regressing plaques are characterized by transitioning of macrophages to  status as inflammation resolves.Apolipoprotein E mice on a high- diet for 12 weeks were reconstituted with bone marrow from apolipoprotein E-producing wild-type or MΦLRP1 mice, and then placed on a chow diet for 10 weeks (n=9 to 11 mice/group). A cohort of apolipoprotein E mice reconstituted with apolipoprotein E bone marrow served as baseline controls (n=9).Plaques of both wild-type and MΦLRP1 bone marrow recipients regressed compared with controls (11% and 22%, respectively; P<0.05), and plaques of MΦLRP1 recipients were 13% smaller than those of wild-type recipients ( P<0.05). Recipients of MΦLRP1 marrow had 36% fewer M1 macrophages ( P<0.01) and 2.5-fold more CCR7 (C-C chemokine receptor type 7)-positive macrophages in the plaque relative to wild-type mice ( P<0.01). Additionally, in vivo studies of cellular egress showed a 4.6-fold increase in 5-ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine-labeled CCR7 macrophages in mediastinal lymph nodes. Finally, in vivo studies of reverse cholesterol transport showed a 1.4-fold higher reverse cholesterol transport in MΦLRP1 recipient mice ( P<0.01).Absence of macrophage low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 unexpectedly accelerates atherosclerosis regression, enhances reverse cholesterol transport, and increases expression of the motility receptor CCR7, which drives macrophage egress from lesions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30628018>MiR-124 Enriched Exosomes Promoted the  Polarization of Microglia and Enhanced Hippocampus Neurogenesis After Traumatic Brain Injury by Inhibiting TLR4 Pathway.</a></h2><p>MicroRNA-124 (miR-124) is a brain specific miRNA that is highly expressed in microglia. The upregulation of miR-124 contributes to  polarization of microglia, which is beneficial to neurogenesis. Exosomes are  membrane vesicles that can deliver miR-124 into the brain. However, whether miR-124 enriched exosomes (Exo-miR-124) can regulate the polarization of microglia and affect hippocampus neurogenesis after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is unknown. To clarify this, the Exo-miR-124 was first constructed, and then was intravenously administrated into rats via tail vein with the dose of 3 × 10 particles/each rat at 24 h post TBI. The polarization of microglia in hippocampus was evaluated through measuring the signature genes and cytokines of M1/ phenotype by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) at 7/14/21/28 days after TBI. Hippocampus neurogenesis was evaluated through detecting the proliferation marker BrdU/SOX2 and differentiation marker BrdU/NeuN by immunofluorescence (IF) at 7 and 28 days after TBI respectively. Neurological function was evaluated by neurological severity score (NSS) and morris water maze (MWM) at 7/14/21/28 and 24-28 days after TBI respectively. To explore the underlying mechanisms, the mRNA expression of TLR4 pathway molecules in hippocampus were measured by RT-PCR, and the polarization of microglia and the activation of TLR4 pathway in BV2 cells were measured after exosome treatment as well. Results demonstrated that Exo-miR-124 treatment promoted the  polarization of microglia, enhanced neurogenesis in hippocampus, and improved function recovery after TBI. The  polarization effect of Exo-miR-124 was produced through inhibiting TLR4 pathway, which was verified in hippocampus and BV2 microglia. In conclusion, Exo-miR-124 treatment promoted  polarization of microglia and improved hippocampal neurogenesis and functional recovery after brain injury, which might be a strategy to improve the outcome of TBI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29917037>High plasma apolipoprotein B identifies obese subjects who best ameliorate white adipose tissue dysfunction and glucose-induced hyperinsulinemia after a hypocaloric diet.</a></h2><p>To optimize the prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D), high-risk obese subjects with the best metabolic recovery after a hypocaloric diet should be targeted. Apolipoprotein B lipoproteins (apoB lipoproteins) induce white adipose tissue (WAT) dysfunction, which in turn promotes postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance (IR), and hyperinsulinemia.The aim of this study was to explore whether high plasma apoB, or number of plasma apoB lipoproteins, identifies subjects who best ameliorate WAT dysfunction and related risk factors after a hypocaloric diet.Fifty-nine men and postmenopausal women [mean ± SD age: 58 ± 6 y; body mass index (kg/): 32.6 ± 4.6] completed a prospective study with a 6-mo hypocaloric diet (-500 kcal/d). Glucose-induced insulin secretion (GIIS) and insulin sensitivity (IS) were measured by 1-h intravenous glucose-tolerance test (IVGTT) followed by a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, respectively. Ex vivo gynoid WAT function (i.e., hydrolysis and storage of 3H-triolein-labeled triglyceride-rich lipoproteins) and 6-h postprandial plasma clearance of a 13C-triolein-labeled high- meal were measured in a subsample (n = 25).Postintervention first-phase GIISIVGTT and total C-peptide secretion decreased in both sexes, whereas second-phase and total GIISIVGTT and clamp IS were ameliorated in men (P < 0.05). Baseline plasma apoB was associated with a postintervention increase in WAT function (r = 0.61) and IS (glucose infusion rate divided by steady state insulin (M/Iclamp) r = 0.30) and a decrease in first-phase, second-phase, and total GIISIVGTT (r = -0.30 to -0.35) without sex differences. The association with postintervention amelioration in WAT function and GIISIVGTT was independent of plasma cholesterol (total, LDL, and HDL), sex, and changes in body composition. Subjects with high baseline plasma apoB (1.2 ± 0.2 g/L) showed a significant increase in WAT function (+105%; P = 0.012) and a decrease in total GIISIVGTT (-34%; P ≤ 0.001), whereas sex-matched subjects with low plasma apoB (0.7 ± 0.1 g/L) did not, despite equivalent changes in body composition and energy intake and expenditure.High plasma apoB identifies obese subjects who best ameliorate WAT dysfunction and glucose-induced hyperinsulinemia, independent of changes in adiposity after consumption of a hypocaloric diet. We propose that subjects with high plasma apoB represent an optimal target group for the primary prevention of T2D by hypocaloric diets.

Therefore, we aimed to test the hypothesis that inhibition of E-selectin-mediated interactions by a new E-selectin-targeted copolymer could inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis. To target E-selectin on activated endothelium, we developed a new N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA)-based E-selectin binding copolymer with or without dexamethasone (Dex) (designated P-(Esbp)-Dex and P-Esbp, respectively). To determine the effect of P-(Esbp)-Dex and P-Esbp on atherosclerosis, we allocated ApoE  mice on a high  diet, to weekly intra-peritoneal injections of either 1) P-Esbp; 2) P-(Esbp)-Dex; 3) free Dex (1 mg/kg) or 4) saline, for four weeks. Aortic atherosclerosis and left ventricular (LV) remodeling and function were assessed by serial ultrasound studies and histology. Monocytes and macrophages were characterized by flow cytometry. After four weeks of treatment, P-Esbp effectively targeted aortic atherosclerotic lesions. Both P-Esbp and P-(Esbp)-Dex reduced wall thickening of the ascending aortas. However, only the drug-free copolymer (P-Esbp) significantly decreased the areas of necrotic core in the plaques and switched spleen macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory () phenotype. Furthermore, P-Esbp attenuated adverse LV remodeling and dysfunction in ApoE  mice. In summary, P-Esbp copolymer targets activated endothelial cells, regresses and stabilizes atherosclerotic plaques, and prevents adverse LV remodeling and dysfunction in ApoE  mice. Our results suggest a new, drug-free macromolecular therapy to treat vascular inflammation.Copyright © 2018.

When exactly this happens, during progressive WL, remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the timeline of changes in RMR and exercise-induced EE (EIEE), stemming from changes in body composition v. the presence of AT, during WL with a very-low-energy diet (VLED). In all, thirty-one adults (eighteen men) with obesity (BMI: 37 (sem 4·5) kg/; age: 43 (sem 10) years) underwent 8 weeks of a VLED, followed by 4 weeks of weight maintenance. Body weight and composition, RMR, net EIEE (10, 25 and 50 W) and AT (for RMR (ATRMR) and EIEE (ATEIEE)) were measured at baseline, day 3 (2 (sem 1) % WL), after 5 and 10 % WL and at weeks 9 (16 (sem 2) %) and 13 (16 (sem 1) %). RMR and  mass were significantly reduced for the first time at 5 % WL (12 (sem 8) d) (P<0·01 and P<0·001, respectively) and EIEE at 10 % WL (32 (sem 8) d), for all levels of power (P<0·05), and sustained up to week 13. ATRMR was transiently present at 10 % WL (-460 (sem 690) kJ/d, P<0·01). A fall in RMR should be anticipated at ≥5 % WL and a reduction in EIEE at ≥10 % WL. Transient ATRMR can be expected at 10 % WL. These physiological adaptations may make progressive WL difficult and will probably contribute to relapse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31268904>Metformin improved oxidized low-density lipoprotein-impaired mitochondrial function and increased glucose uptake involving Akt-AS160 pathway in raw264.7 macrophages.</a></h2><p>Macrophage accumulation in the vascular wall is a hallmark of atherosclerosis. Studies showed that shifting of oxidized lipids-induced inflammatory macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype by promoting oxidative  attenuated atherosclerosis progression. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether metformin, which has ameliorated atherosclerosis in animal models and clinical trials, modulated oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) induced inflammatory status in macrophages by regulating cellular oxidative .Murine raw264.7 macrophages were incubated with Ox-LDL (50 μg/mL) in the presence or absence of metformin (15 μmol/L) for 24 h. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the transcription of classically activated (M1) pro-inflammatory and alternatively activated () anti-inflammatory markers and mitochondrial DNA copy numbers. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by immunofluorescence. Cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, glucose uptake, and lactic acid production were measured by commercial kit and normalized to cellular lysates. Western blotting analysis was performed to detect the expression of mitochondrial fusion/fission related proteins, enzymes mediating  and signaling pathway of glucose transport. Differences between groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance.Metformin improved Ox-LDL-impaired anti-inflammatory phenotype in raw264.7 macrophages as shown by up-regulated transcription of anti-inflammatory markers including interleukin 10 (0.76 ± 0.04 vs. 0.94 ± 0.01, P = 0.003) and Resistin-like molecule alpha (0.67 ± 0.08 vs. 1.78 ± 0.34, P = 0.030). Conversely, Ox-LDL-diminished phosphorylation of Akt was up-regulated by metformin treatment (0.47 ± 0.05 vs. 1.02 ± 0.08, P = 0.040), associated with an improvement of mitochondrial function, characterized by decreased ROS generation (2.50 ± 0.07 vs. 2.15 ± 0.04, P = 0.040), increased  oxidation, and elevated cellular ATP production (0.026 ± 0.001 vs. 0.035 ± 0.003, P = 0.020). Moreover, metformin-mediated Akt activation increased Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) phosphorylation (0.51 ± 0.04 vs. 1.03 ± 0.03, P = 0.0041), promoted membrane translocation of glucose transporter 1, and increased glucose influx into the cells (4.78 ± 0.04 vs. 5.47 ± 0.01, P < 0.001).This study suggested that targeting macrophage  with new or existing drugs had therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29721771>Oxidative stress stimulates invasive potential in rat C6 and human U-87 MG glioblastoma cells via activation and cross-talk between PKM2, ENPP2 and APE1 enzymes.</a></h2><p>Maintaining genomic integrity is essential for cell survival and viability. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction results in oxidative stress leading to the genomic instability via generation of small base lesions in DNA and these unrepaired DNA damages lead to various cellular consequences including cancer. Recent data support the concept "oxidative stress is an indispensable participant in fostering proliferation, survival, and migration" in various cancer cell types including glioblastoma cells. In this study we demonstrate that treatment of non-cytotoxic doses of oxidants such as amyloid beta [Aβ(25-35)] peptide, glucose oxidase (GO), and hydrogen peroxide (HO) for 24 h and 48 h time points found to increase the expression level and activity of a multifunctional enzyme Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1), a key enzyme of base excision repair (BER) pathway which takes care of base damages; and also resulted in modulation in the expression levels of downstream BER-pathway enzymes viz. PARP-1, XRCC1, DNA polβ, and ligase IIIα was observed upon oxidative stress in C6 and U-87 MG cells. Oxidants treatment to the C6 and U-87 MG cells also resulted in an elevation in the intracellular expression of glycolytic pathway enzyme Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) and the metastasis inducer protein Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2 (ENPP2) as analyzed using Western blotting and Immunofluorescence microscopic studies. Our study also reports that oxidative stress induced for 24 h and 48 h in C6 and U-87 MG cells resulted in extracellular secretion of APE1 and ENPP2 as analyzed using Western blotting in conditioned media. However, the biological significance of extracellular secreted APE1 remains elusive. Oxidative stress also elevated the ENPP2's LysoPLD activity in conditioned media of C6 and U-87 MG cells. Our results also demonstrate that oxidative stress affects the expression level and localization of APE1, PKM2, and ENPP2 in C6 and U-87 MG cells. As evidenced by the colocalization pattern at 24 h and 48 h time points, it can be attributed that oxidative stress mediates crosstalk between APE1, PKM2, and ENPP2. In addition, when C6 and U-87 MG cells were treated with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive  that negatively regulates ENPP2's LysoPLD activity at 10 μM concentration, demonstrated strong migratory potential in C6 and U-87 MG cells, and also induced migration upon oxidative stress. Altogether, the findings demonstrate the potential of C6 and U-87 MG cells to utilize three proteins viz. APE1, PKM2, and ENPP2 towards migration and survival of gliomas. Thus the knowledge on oxidative stress induced APE1's interaction with PKM2 and ENPP2 opens a new channel for the therapeutic target(s) for gliomas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31225583>Total energy expenditure in patients with colorectal cancer: associations with body composition, physical activity, and energy recommendations.</a></h2><p>Total energy expenditure (TEE) data in patients with early-stage cancer are scarce, precluding an understanding of energy requirements.The objective was to cross-sectionally characterize TEE in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and to compare measured TEE with energy recommendations. It was hypothesized that TEE would differ according to body mass, body composition, and physical activity level (PAL) and current energy recommendations would have poor individual-level accuracy.Patients with newly diagnosed CRC had resting energy expenditure (REE) measured by indirect calorimetry and TEE by doubly labeled water. Hypermetabolism was defined as REE > 110% of that predicted from the Mifflin St.-Jeor equation. Body composition was assessed via DXA. Physical activity was determined as the ratio of TEE to REE (TEE:REE) (PAL) and residual activity energy expenditure (RAEE). TEE was compared with energy recommendations of 25-30 kcal/d and Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) using Bland-Altman analyses. Patients were stratified according to median BMI, PAL, and sex-specific ratio of  mass (FM) to -free mass (FFM).Twenty-one patients (M:F 14:7; mean ± SD BMI: 28.3 ± 4.9 kg/, age: 57 ± 12 y) were included. Most (n = 20) had stage II-III disease; 1 had stage IV. Approximately half (n = 11) were hypermetabolic; TEE was not different in those with hypermetabolism and REE as a percentage of predicted was not correlated with TEE. Mean ± SD TEE was 2473 ± 499 kcal/d (range: 1562-3622 kcal/d), or 29.7 ± 6.3 kcal/kg body weight (range: 20.4-48.5 kcal/kg body weight). Mean ± SD PAL was 1.43 ± 0.27. The energy recommendation of 25 kcal/kg underestimated TEE (-12.6% ± 16.5%, P = 0.002); all energy recommendations had wide limits of agreement (the smallest was DRI with measured PAL: -21.2% to 29.3%). Patients with higher BMI and FM:FFM had higher bias using kilocalories per kilogram recommendations; bias from several recommendations was frequently lower (i.e. underestimation) in patients with higher PAL and RAEE.TEE variability was not reflected in energy recommendations and error was related to body weight, body composition, and physical activity.

Since inflammation is one of the underlying mechanisms involved in the development of obesity-associated metabolic dysfunctions, we aimed to determine the effect of dietary supplementation with MOS on inflammation and metabolic homeostasis in lean and diet-induced obese mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a low  diet (LFD) or a high  diet (HFD) with, respectively, 10% or 45% energy derived from lard , with or without 1% MOS for 17 weeks. Body weight and composition were measured throughout the study. After 12 weeks of intervention, whole-body glucose tolerance was assessed and in week 17 immune cell composition was determined in mesenteric white adipose tissue (mWAT) and liver by flow cytometry and RT-qPCR. In LFD-fed mice, MOS supplementation induced a significant increase in the abundance of macrophages and eosinophils in mWAT. A similar trend was observed in hepatic macrophages. Although HFD feeding induced a classical shift from the anti-inflammatory -like macrophages towards the pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages in both mWAT and liver from control mice, MOS supplementation had no effect on this obesity-driven immune response. Finally, MOS supplementation did not improve whole-body glucose homeostasis in both lean and obese mice.Altogether, our data showed that MOS had extra-intestinal immune modulatory properties in mWAT and liver. However these effects were not substantial enough to significantly ameliorate HFD-induced glucose intolerance or inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29596606>Menopausal Hormone Therapy Is Associated With Reduced Total and Visceral Adiposity: The OsteoLaus Cohort.</a></h2><p>After menopause,  mass (FM) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) increase and nonbone lean body mass (LBM) decreases.

We assessed subtotal and android FM, LBM, muscle strength (hand grip), and confounding factors (caloric intake, physical activity, biomarkers).The groups significantly differed in age, NU < CU < PU. Age-adjusted VAT was lower in CUs than NUs (P = 0.03). CUs exhibited lower age-adjusted body mass index (BMI) (-0.9 kg/) and a trend for lower FM (-1.3 kg). The 10-year gain of VAT (P < 0.01) and subtotal and android FM (P < 0.05) was prevented in CUs. No difference in LBM or hand grip was detected. No residual effect was detected for PUs, including for early MHT discontinuers. The confounding factors did not significantly differ between groups except for higher caloric intake in PUs compared with NUs.MHT is associated with significantly decreased VAT, BMI, and android FM. No benefit is detected for LBM.

Emerging evidence has suggested that UroA modulates energy  in various cells. However, UroA's physiological functions related to obesity and insulin resistance remain unclear.Male mice were intraperitoneally administrated either UroA or dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle) along with a high- diet for 12 weeks. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated via glucose and insulin tolerance tests and acute insulin signaling. The effects of UroA on hepatic triglyceride accumulation, adipocyte size, mitochondrial DNA content, and proinflammatory gene expressions were determined. The impact of UroA on macrophage polarization and mitochondrial respiration were assessed in bone marrow-derived macrophages.Administration of UroA (1) improved systemic insulin sensitivity, (2) attenuated triglyceride accumulation and elevated mitochondrial biogenesis in the liver, (3) reduced adipocyte hypertrophy and macrophage infiltration into the adipose tissue, and (4) altered M1/ polarization in peritoneal macrophages. In addition, UroA favored macrophage  polarization and mitochondrial respiration in bone marrow-derived macrophages.UroA plays a direct role in improving systemic insulin sensitivity independent of its parental compounds.

During cell entry, σ3 is degraded by luminal or intracellular proteases to generate the infectious subviral particle (ISVP). When ISVP formation is prevented, reovirus fails to establish a productive infection, suggesting proteolytic priming is required for entry. ISVPs are then converted to ISVP*s, which is accompanied by μ1 rearrangements. The μ1 and σ3 proteins confer resistance to inactivating agents; however, neither the impact on capsid properties nor the mechanism (or basis) of inactivation is fully understood. Here, we utilized T1L/T3D  and T3D/T1L S4 to investigate the determinants of reovirus stability. Both reassortants encode mismatched subunits. When μ1-σ3 were derived from different strains, virions resembled wild-type particles in structure and protease sensitivity. T1L/T3D  and T3D/T1L S4 ISVPs were less thermostable than wild-type ISVPs. In contrast, virions were equally susceptible to heating. Virion associated μ1 adopted an ISVP*-like conformation concurrent with inactivation; σ3 preserves infectivity by preventing μ1 rearrangements. Moreover, thermostability was enhanced by a hyperstable variant of μ1. Unlike the outer capsid, the inner capsid (core) was highly resistant to elevated temperatures. The dual layered architecture allowed for differential sensitivity to inactivating agents. Nonenveloped and enveloped viruses are exposed to the environment during transmission to a new host. Protein-protein and/or protein- interactions stabilize the particle and protect the viral genome. Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is composed of two concentric, protein shells. The μ1 and σ3 proteins form the outer capsid; contacts between neighboring subunits are thought to confer resistance to inactivating agents. We further investigated the determinants of reovirus stability. The outer capsid was disrupted concurrent with the loss of infectivity; virion associated μ1 rearranged into an altered conformation. Heat sensitivity was controlled by σ3; however, particle integrity was enhanced by a single μ1 mutation. In contrast, the inner capsid (core) displayed superior resistance to heating. These findings reveal structural components that differentially contribute to reovirus stability.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626624>Polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites: biosynthesis in  and role in parasite/host interaction.</a></h2><p>Inside the human host,  infection starts with phagocytosis of infective promastigotes by macrophages.

The treatment of macrophages with lipids extracted from the infective forms of the parasite led to  macrophage polarization and blocked the differentiation into the M1 phenotype induced by IFN-γ. In conclusion,  polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites, produced by cytochrome P450-like protein activity, are implicated in parasite/host interactions by promoting the polarization of macrophages into a proresolving  phenotype.Copyright © 2019 Paloque et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30181158>High CD8 T-Cell Receptor Clonality and Altered CDR3 Properties Are Associated With Elevated Isolevuglandins in Adipose Tissue During Diet-Induced Obesity.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue (AT) CD4 and CD8 T cells contribute to obesity-associated insulin resistance. Prior studies identified conserved T-cell receptor (TCR) chain families in obese AT, but the presence and clonal expansion of specific TCR sequences in obesity has not been assessed. We characterized AT and liver CD8 and CD4 TCR repertoires of mice fed a low- diet (LFD) and high- diet (HFD) using deep sequencing of the TCRβ chain to quantify clonal expansion, gene usage, and CDR3 sequence. In AT CD8 T cells, HFD reduced TCR diversity, increased the prevalence of public TCR clonotypes, and selected for TCR CDR3 regions enriched in positively charged and less polarized amino acids. Although TCR repertoire alone could distinguish between LFD- and HFD-fed mice, these properties of the CDR3 region of AT CD8 T cells from HFD-fed mice led us to examine the role of negatively charged and nonpolar isolevuglandin (isoLG) adduct-containing antigen-presenting cells within AT. IsoLG-adducted protein species were significantly higher in AT macrophages of HFD-fed mice; isoLGs were elevated in -polarized macrophages, promoting CD8 T-cell activation. Our findings demonstrate that clonal TCR expansion that favors positively charged CDR3s accompanies HFD-induced obesity, which may be an antigen-driven response to isoLG accumulation in macrophages.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30221356>Down-regulation of PKM2 decreases FASN expression in bladder cancer cells through AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1c axis.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid synthase (FASN) catalyzing the terminal steps in the de novo biogenesis of fatty acids is correlated with low survival and high disease recurrence in patients with bladder cancer. Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) regulates the final step of glycolysis levels and provides a growth advantage to tumors. However, it is unclear whether the change of PKM2 has an effect on FASN and what is the mechanisms underlying. Here we describe a novel function of PKM2 in control of  by mediating transcriptional activation of FASN, showing the reduced expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c). We first discovered that PKM2 physically interacts with the SREBP-1c using biochemical approaches, and downregulation of PKM2 reduced the expression of SREBP-1c by inactivating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which in turn directly suppressed the transcription of major lipogenic genes FASN to reduce tumor growths. Furthermore, either PKM2 inhibitor-Shikonin or FASN inhibitor-TVB-3166 alone induced a strong antiproliferative and anticolony forming effect in bladder cancer cell line. The combination of both inhibitors exhibits a super synergistic effect on blocking the bladder cancer cells growth. It provides a new target and scientific basis for the treatment of bladder cancer.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29996339>[Effect of -induced macrophage M1/ polarization on  in hepatocytes].</a></h2><p> This study aims to explore the effect of -induced macrophage M1/ polarization on  in hepatocytes.  RAW264.7 macrophages were incubated with different kinds of fatty acids including saturated fatty acids-palmitic acid (PA), monounsaturated fatty acids-oleic acid (OA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and cell culture supernatants were collected to prepare conditioned medium (CM). Hepatocytes were isolated by in situ perfusion of the liver with collagenase in mice, and a macrophage-hepatocyte CM co-culture system was established. Macrophage M1/ phenotype markers were detected by Real-time PCR.  synthesis and decomposition related mRNA and protein expressions in hepatocytes were detected by Real-time PCR and Western Blot.  depositions in hepatocytes were detected by oil red O staining. An analysis of variance was used for comparison of means between multiple groups.  Compared with control groups, PA polarized macrophages to a M1 phenotype (expression of TNF-α and IL-6 significantly increased, F≥22.68, P < 0.01), OA polarized macrophages to a M1/ mixed phenotype (expression of IL-6, Mrc2 and IL-10 increased F≥4.94, P < 0.05) and DHA polarized macrophages to a  phenotype (expression of Mrc2 and IL-10 significantly increased, F≥4.94, P < 0.01). CM-PA significantly increased  synthesis related genes, including SREBP1C, ACC1 mRNA expression (F≥5.66, P < 0.01) and FASN, ACC1 protein expression (F≥38.34, P < 0.05) in hepatocytes, and decreased  decomposition gene ACOX1 protein expression (F=154.48, P < 0.01). CM-OA affected several  genes expression. CM-DHA significantly increased CPT1A mRNA expression (F = 10.30, P < 0.01) and ACOX1, CPT1A protein expression (F≥47.06, P < 0.05), and decreased SREBP1C, ACC1 protein expression (F≥65.84, P < 0.05) in hepatocytes. Massive  droplets were deposited in hepatocytes in CM-PA treated hepatocytes, and a few amount of  droplets were deposited in CM-DHA treated hepatocytes.

In this work, we demonstrate that DNA-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (DNA-SPIONs), prepared by attaching DNA oligonucleotides to poly(ethylene glycol)-coated SPIONs (PEG-SPIONs), effectively accumulate in the macrophages of atherosclerotic plaques following an intravenous injection into apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE) mice. DNA-SPIONs enter RAW 264.7 macrophages faster and more abundantly than PEG-SPIONs. DNA-SPIONs mostly enter RAW 264.7 cells by engaging Class A scavenger receptors (SR-A) and  rafts and traffic inside the cell along the endolysosomal pathway. ABS-SPIONs, nanoparticles with a similarly polyanionic surface charge as DNA-SPIONs but bearing abasic oligonucleotides also effectively bind to SR-A and enter RAW 264.7 cells. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging reveals evident localization of DNA-SPIONs in the heart and aorta 30 min post-injection. Aortic iron content for DNA-SPIONs climbs to the peak (∼60% ID/g) 2 h post-injection (accompanied by profuse accumulation in the aortic root), but it takes 8 h for PEG-SPIONs to reach the peak aortic amount (∼44% ID/g). ABS-SPIONs do not appreciably accumulate in the aorta or aortic root, suggesting that the DNA coating (not the surface charge) dictates in vivo plaque accumulation. Flow cytometry analysis reveals more pronounced uptake of DNA-SPIONs by hepatic endothelial cells, splenic macrophages and dendritic cells, and aortic  macrophages (the cell type with the highest uptake in the aorta) than PEG-SPIONs. In summary, coating nanoparticles with DNA is an effective strategy of promoting their systemic delivery to atherosclerotic plaques.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804937>The Frequencies of Immunosuppressive Cells in Adipose Tissue Differ in Human, Non-human Primate, and Mouse Models.</a></h2><p>Although the metabolic properties of white adipose tissue have been extensively characterized, the tissue's immune properties are now attracting renewed interest. Early experiments in a mouse model suggested that white adipose tissue contains a high density of regulatory T cells (Tregs), and so it was assumed that all adipose tissue has an immunosuppressive profile-even though the investigation was limited to visceral body  in relatively old male mice. This observation was also corroborated by high frequencies of other cell subsets with immunoregulatory properties, such as anti-inflammatory  macrophages, and regulatory B cells. Many studies have since evidenced the persistence of pathogens (trypanosomes, , HIV, etc.) in adipose tissue. However, a recent report identified adipose tissue as a reservoir of memory T cells capable of protecting animals upon rechallenge. The immune potential of lean adipose tissue thus remains to be further investigated. Here, we compared the relative proportions of immune cells (and Tregs in particular) in lean adipose tissue collected from humans, a non-human primate (the cynomolgus macaque), and three mouse models. We demonstrated that the proportion of Foxp3+ Tregs in visceral adipose tissue was low in all models other than the C57Bl/6 mouse. These low values were not linked to correspondingly low proportions of effector cells because T lymphocytes (a main target of Treg suppression) were more frequent in cynomolgus macaques than in C57Bl/6 mice and (to a lesser extent) humans. In contrast, the proportions of macrophages and B cells were lower in cynomolgus macaques than in C57Bl/6 mice. We also observed a higher proportion of CD34+CD45- cells (which predominantly correspond to mesenchymal stem cells) in C57Bl/6 mouse and cynomolgus macaques than in humans and both for subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues. Lastly, a microscopy analysis confirmed predominant proportion of adipocytes within adipose tissue, and highlighted a marked difference in adipocyte size among the three species studied. In conclusion, our study of lean, middle-aged, male individuals showed that the immune compartment of adipose tissue differed markedly in humans vs. mice, and suggesting the presence of a more inflammatory steady-state profile in humans than mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625338>Metformin delays AKT/c-Met-driven hepatocarcinogenesis by regulating signaling pathways for de novo lipogenesis and ATP generation.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal malignancy with few effective options for therapeutic treatment in its advanced stages. Metformin, a first-line oral agent used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, exhibits efficacy in metabolic reprogramming fueling changes in cell growth and proliferation for multiple cancer types, including HCC. However, the molecular mechanism by which metformin delays hepatocarcinogenesis in individuals with hepatic steatosis remains rare. Here, we investigate the preventive efficacy of metformin in a rapid AKT/c-Met-triggered HCC mouse model featuring excessive levels of steatosis. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, Oil Red O staining and immunoblotting were applied for mechanistic investigations. Pharmacological and biochemical strategies were employed to illuminate molecular evidence for HCC cell lines. The results show that metformin obstructs the malignant transformation of hepatocytes in AKT/c-Met mice. Mechanistically, metformin reduces the expression of phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) and two forms of proto-oncogenes, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc, in AKT/c-Met mice. Moreover, metformin ameliorates FASN-mediated aberrant lipogenesis and HK2/PKM2-driven ATP generation in vivo. Furthermore, metformin represses the expression of FASN and HK-2 by targeting c-Myc in an AMPK-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, metformin is effective at inhibiting PKM2 expression in the presence of an AMPK inhibitor compound C, suggesting that its functioning in PKM2 is AMPK-independent. Our study experimentally validates a novel molecular mechanism by which metformin alleviates enhanced lipogenesis and high energy  during hepatocarcinogenesis, indicating that metformin may serve as an agent for the prevention of HCC in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Repeated blood and muscle samples were obtained to assess protein digestion and amino acid absorption kinetics, and basal and postprandial myofibrillar protein synthesis rates.Exogenous phenylalanine appearance rates increased after protein ingestion in both groups (P < 0.001), with a total of 53 ± 1% and 53 ± 2% of dietary protein-derived phenylalanine appearing in the circulation over the 5-h postprandial period in lean and obese men, respectively (P = 0.82). After protein ingestion, whole-body protein synthesis and oxidation rates increased to a greater extent in lean men than in the obese (P-interaction < 0.05), resulting in a higher whole-body protein net balance in the lean than in the obese (7.1 ± 0.2 and 4.6 ± 0.4 µmol phenylalanine · h-1 · kg-1, respectively; P-interaction < 0.001).

Accordingly, macrophages occupy distinct metabolic profiles, regulated by orchestrated factors and signaling pathways, including the PI3K-AKT, HIF, c-Myc, AMPK, and PPARs pathways. These factors and pathways play pivotal roles not only in metabolic regulation but also in macrophage polarization. After activation, classically activated M1 macrophages and alternatively activated  macrophages display distinct patterns in glucose, , amino acid and iron . Here, we summarized recently discovered -related inflammatory signaling factors, along with reprogrammed , after the activation of macrophages under conditions related to immunity and cancer. Additionally, macrophage regulatory roles in infectious diseases, cancer progression and anti-cancer immunotherapy are discussed in terms of metabolic profiles, providing insight into the prevention and treatment of immune-associated diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Irisin is a myokine produced by skeletal muscle after physical exercise, and originally described as a molecule able to promote the browning of white adipose tissue and energy expenditure. In order to decrease cardiovascular risk, it has been proposed as a promising therapeutic target in obesity and type 2 diabetes. We investigated the relationships between serum concentrations of irisin and the adipokines adiponectin and leptin and body  including epicardial  in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. We obtained serum samples from 93 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery (age 69.6 (SD 12.8) years, BMI 24.1 ± 4.8 kg/). Computed tomography (CT) and echocardiographic data were obtained from the routine preoperative examination. Subcutaneous  area (SFA, cm2) and visceral  area (VFA, cm2) near the umbilicus were automatically measured using the standard  attenuation range. Epicardial  area (EFA, cm2) was measured at the position where the heart became a long axis image with respect to the apex of the heart in the coronal section image. Total body  mass, body  percentage, and skeletal muscle volume (SMV) were estimated using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Serum irisin concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and compared with adiponectin and leptin concentrations. The data were also compared with the clinical biochemical data. EFA was strongly correlated with BMI (P = 0.0001), non-HDL-C (P = 0.029), TG (P = 0.004), body  mass (P = 0.0001), and body  percentage (P = 0.0001). Serum leptin concentration showed a significant positive correlation with BMI (P = 0.0001) and TG (P = 0.001). Adiponectin, but not irisin, showed a significant negative correlation with BMI (P = 0.006) and TG (P = 0.001). Serum leptin level had a significant positive correlation with EFA, VFA, and SFA. In contrast, the serum adiponectin level was significantly negatively correlated with EFA, VFA, and SFA. The serum irisin level was also negatively correlated with EFA (r = -0.249, P = 0.015), and SFA (r = -0.223, P = 0.039), and tended to correlate with VFA (r = -0.198, P = 0.067). The serum level of adiponectin was negatively correlated with that of leptin (r = -0.296, P = 0.012), but there were no significant correlations between irisin and either adiponectin or leptin. Multivariate linear regression demonstrated that EFA showed a positive association with serum leptin level (β = 0.438, P = 0.0001) and a negative correlation with serum irisin level (β = -0.204, P = 0.038) and serum adiponectin level (β = -0.260, P = 0.015) after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. The present study provided the first evidence of associations of the serum irisin and adipokines (adiponectin and leptin) concentrations with epicardial  in cardiovascular surgery patients. Irisin may play a role in preventing excess adiposity including epicardial , and consequently cardiovascular risk in patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30338997>Determining Cholesterol Binding to Membrane Proteins by Cholesterol C Labeling in Yeast and Dynamic Nuclear Polarization NMR.</a></h2><p>We present a general strategy for determining the cholesterol-binding site of eukaryotic membrane proteins in native-like  membranes by NMR spectroscopy. The strategy combines yeast biosynthetic C enrichment of cholesterol with detection of protein-cholesterol C-C cross peaks in 2D correlation NMR spectra under the dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) condition. Low-temperature DNP not only allows high-sensitivity detection of weak protein-cholesterol cross peaks in 2D spectra but also immobilizes cholesterol and protein to enable intermolecular distance measurements. We demonstrate this approach on the influenza  protein, which utilizes cholesterol to conduct membrane scission in the last step of virus budding and release from the host cell plasma membrane. A C-C double-quantum filter was employed to significantly simplify the 2D C-C correlation spectra and facilitate the identification of protein-cholesterol cross peaks. A number of cross peaks between the  transmembrane residues' side chains and the cholesterol sterol group were detected, which complement recently measured protein contacts to the isooctyl tail of cholesterol to define an extended binding interface. These results provide atomic-level evidence of -cholesterol interaction to cause membrane curvature and scission, and the approach is generally applicable to other eukaryotic membrane proteins for understanding the influence of cholesterol on membrane protein function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30610591>Prestimulation of Microglia Through TLR4 Pathway Promotes Interferon Beta Expression in a Rat Model of Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h2><p>Soluble amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers are the most common forms of Aβ in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). They are highly toxic to the neurons but their capability to activate microglia remains controversial. Microglia develop two distinct phenotypes, classic (M1) and alternative (). Tuning of microglia to the alternative (anti-inflammatory) state is of major interest in treatment of neuroinflammatory disease. This study aimed to assess tuning the microglia to produce interferon beta (IFN-β) as an anti-inflammatory cytokine through TLR4 pathway in a rat model of AD. Microglial BV-2 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharides (LPS), Monophosphoryl  A (MPL), or vehicles for 24 h, and then incubated with Aβ oligomer. After 24 h, cell pellets were harvested and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and IFN-β levels were measured. The ligands/vehicle were microinjected into the right ventricle of male Wistar rats every 3 days. Two weeks later, an osmotic pump filled with oligomeric Aβ/vehicle was implanted in the left ventricle. After 2 weeks, TRIF, IRF3, and IFN-β levels were measured in the hippocampal tissue. TNF-α and IFN-β levels were assessed in the hippocampus using immunohistochemistry. The oligomeric Aβ did not change TRIF, IRF3, and IFN-β levels in both cell culture and hippocampal tissue. However, pretreatment with LPS or MPL increased the level of these proteins. BV-2 cells morphologically express M1 state in presence of higher dose of Aβ oligomer (10 μM). Pretreatment with LPS or MPL decreased the TNF-α and increased the number of IFN-β positive cells in the hippocampus of Aβ-treated rats. In conclusion, pretreatment with low dose TLR4 agonists could induce microglia to produce neuroprotective cytokines including IFN-β which may be considered as a potential strategy to combat neuronal degeneration in AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664204>Genetic polymorphisms of melatonin receptors 1A and 1B may result in disordered  in obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which a woman's levels of the sex hormones (estrogen and progesterone) are out of balance, leading to the growth of ovarian cysts. PCOS can affect the menstrual cycle, fertility, cardiac function and even appearance of women. Therefore, we aimed to explore the genetic polymorphism of the melatonin receptors 1A and 1B in obese patients with PCOS to identify a new theoretical basis for its treatment. Patients presenting with PCOS (n=359) were enrolled and classified into an obese OB‑PCOS group [body mass index (BMI) of PCOS patients ≥25 kg/] or a nonobese NOB‑PCOS group, and 215 oviduct infertile patients who experienced normal ovulation were used as the control group. All baseline characteristics, endocrine hormone levels,  and glucose , and insulin indices were measured. The genotypes of rs2119882 within the MTNR1A gene and of rs10830963 within the MTNR1B gene were determined by PCR‑RFLP; the genotype frequency and the difference in the distribution of allele frequency were compared. For rs2119882, C allele carriers who were not diagnosed with PCOS had an increased risk of developing PCOS, and C allele carriers with PCOS had an increased risk of developing OB‑PCOS. For rs10830963, G allele carriers who were not diagnosed with PCOS had an increased risk of developing PCOS. The TT genotype in rs2119882 and the CC genotype in rs10830963 were protective factors for OB‑PCOS, and increased levels of LH, testosterone, and estradiol and abnormal menstruation were key risk factors for PCOS. Furthermore, the TT genotype at the rs2119882 site was the key protective factor for OB‑PCOS patients. Our study found that MTNR1A rs2119882 and MTNR1B rs10830963 could increase the risk for PCOS and cause glycolipid  disorder in PCOS patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30923552> Macrophages as a Potential Target for Antiatherosclerosis Treatment.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic progressive inflammation course, which could induce life-threatening diseases such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Optimal medical treatments for atherosclerotic risk factors with current antihypertensive and -lowering drugs (for example, statins) are widely used in clinical practice. However, many patients with established disease still continue to have recurrent cardiovascular events in spite of treatment with a state-of-the-art therapy. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Hence, current treatment of atherosclerosis is still far from being satisfactory. Recently,  macrophages have been found associated with atherosclerosis regression. The  phenotype can secrete anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-10 and TGF-, promote tissue remodeling and repairing through collagen formation, and clear dying cells and debris by efferocytosis. Therefore, modulators targeting macrophages' polarization to the  phenotype could be another promising treatment strategy for atherosclerosis. Two main signaling pathways, the Akt/mTORC/LXR pathway and the JAK/STAT6 pathway, are found playing important roles in  polarization. In addition, researchers have reported several potential approaches to modulate  polarization. Inhibiting or activating some kinds of enzymes, affecting transcription factors, or acting on several membrane receptors could regulate the polarization of the  phenotype. Besides, biomolecules, for example vitamin D, were found to affect the process of  polarization. Pomegranate juice could promote  polarization via unclear mechanism. In this review, we will discuss how  macrophages affect atherosclerosis regression, signal transduction in  polarization, and outline potential targets and compounds that affect  polarization, thus controlling the progress of atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29685823>The benefits of yoga practice compared to physical exercise in the management of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Yoga is increasingly used as an adjunctive therapy in the management of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The present study aims to systematically evaluate the literature and perform a meta-analysis on the effects of yoga practice compared to physical exercise in the management of T2DM. Data were obtained using a stepwise search process using keywords in the following online medical databases; PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. All controlled clinical trials involving patients with T2DM, comparing yoga as an intervention with physical exercise and evaluating glycaemic control and other outcomes between the intervention and control groups were included in the analysis. Eight studies were eligible to be included in the systematic review. In total, 842 participants were assigned to a Yoga intervention or a control group with an Exercise intervention and the age range of participants was 30-78 years. A significant reduction in FBG (15.16 mg/dl), PPBG (28.66 mg/dl), HbA1c (0.39%) and BMI (0.71 kg/) was noted in the intervention group ('Yoga') compared to the control group ('Physical Exercise') in the pooled analysis. We did not observe any significant difference between the two groups for  parameters, other body composition measures (WC and WHR) and Blood Pressure. In conclusion, our results show that Yoga has beneficial effects on glycaemic control in comparison to physical exercise in T2DM However, individual studies showed considerable heterogeneity. Hence, further well-controlled randomized trials are required prior to drawing conclusions about the benefits of yoga in comparison to physical exercise.Copyright © 2018 Diabetes India.

In Sildenafil-treated mice, the mean change in body weight from baseline positively correlated with VAT, but not with SAT. Characterization of SVF of SAT showed an increase in the frequency of  macrophages and endothelial cells in treated mice.

Krškopolje pigs are reared in conventional and organic production systems, which were compared in the present study. After weaning, 24 barrows were assigned within litter to either conventional (CON) or organic (ECO) rearing system. Group CON (n=12) was housed indoors in two pens (7.5 ) with partly slatted floor. Group ECO (n=12) was held in a sty with sheltered area (concrete floor, bedded with straw, 16 ) and outdoor paddock area (100 ). The trial started when pigs had 68±8 kg BW and 157±6 days of age. Two diets were formulated with equivalent ingredients and composition. For ECO diet the ingredients used were ecological. Group ECO received a diet with 12.4 MJ metabolisable energy (ME) per kilogram and 12.9% CP and group CON a diet with 12.7 MJ ME/kg and 13.6% CP. Feed distribution was limited to 3.5 kg per pig daily. In line with the rules for organic production, ECO pigs were additionally given alfalfa hay ad libitum. After 73 days on trial, the pigs were slaughtered and carcass, meat and  quality was evaluated. Meat quality traits (pH, colour, water holding capacity), fatty acid composition,  and protein oxidation, collagen content and solubility were analysed in longissimus lumborum (LL) muscle. Fatty acid composition,  oxidation, and vitamins A and E concentrations were determined in backfat. There were no significant differences in growth rate and carcass traits between ECO and CON pigs, however, ECO pigs tended (P&lt;0.10) to have higher daily gain and lower dressing percentage, higher (P&lt;0.001) pH 45 min and lower (P&lt;0.01) pH 24 h postmortem, affecting (P&lt;0.10) also water holding capacity and objective colour parameters (P&lt;0.05) of LL muscle.

The transcription factor, PPARα, regulates  in mammals; however, the detailed mechanism whereby PPARαb regulates Elovls remains largely unknown in fish. In the present study, we report the full length cDNA sequence of Trachinotus ovatus Elovl4a (ToElovl4a), which encodes a 320 amino acid polypeptide that possesses five putative membrane-spanning domains, a conserved HXXHH histidine motif and an ER retrieval signal. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the deduced protein of ToElovl4a is highly conserved with the Oreochromis niloticus corresponding homologue. Moreover, functional characterization by heterologous expression in yeast indicated that ToElovl4a can elongate C18 up to C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids. A nutritional study showed that the protein expressions of ToElovl4a in the brain and liver were not significantly affected among the different treatments. The region from PGL3-basic-Elovl4a-5 (-148 bp to +258 bp) is defined as the core promoter via a progressive deletion mutation of ToElovl4a. The results from promoter activity assays suggest that ToElovl4a transcription is positively regulated by PPARαb. Mutation analyses indicated that the  binding site of PPARαb is functionally important for protein binding, and transcriptional activity of the ToElovl4a promoter significantly decreased after targeted mutation. Furthermore, PPARαb RNA interference reduced ToPPARαb and ToElovl4a expression at the protein levels in a time-dependent manner. In summary, PPARαb may promote the biosynthesis of LC-PUFA by regulating ToElovl4a expression in fish.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30680435>Trichosporon fermentans biomass flocculation from soybean oil refinery wastewater using bioflocculant produced from Paecilomyces sp. -1.</a></h2><p>The soybean oil refinery (SOR) wastewater contains a high concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and , so the direct emissions of SOR wastewater will result in environmental pollution and waste of resources. Oleaginous yeast Trichosporon fermentans can consume organic materials in SOR wastewater to synthesize microbial oil, which achieves the purpose of SOR wastewater resource utilization. The effective harvesting technology of oleaginous yeasts can improve the utilization efficiency. In this study, Paecilomyces sp. -1 with high flocculating activity was isolated. The flocculants produced by -1 (MBF2-1) include 75% (w/w) polysaccharides, rely on cations, and display the flocculation percentage of above 77% in the range of pH 2-11. Especially under alkaline conditions, the flocculation percentage can be kept above 97%. The results of scanning electron microscope observation and zeta potential measurements suggested that the bridging, net trapping, and sweeping were the main flocculation mechanism of MBF2-1. MBF2-1 could flocculate T. fermentans that was used to reduce the organic matter in SOR wastewater and to produce microbial oil. Under the optimum conditions, the flocculation percentage of MBF2-1 against T. fermentans from SOR wastewater can reach 95%. Fatty acid content percent in microbial oil from T. fermentans was not almost affected by flocculation of MBF2-1. Moreover, MBF2-1 can further remove 55% and 53% of COD and oil content in the fermented SOR wastewater, respectively. The properties and high flocculating percentage displayed by MBF2-1 indicated its potential application prospect in oleaginous yeast harvest and food industry wastewater treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29891687>Macrophage phenotype and bioenergetics are controlled by oxidized phospholipids identified in lean and obese adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) adapt their metabolic phenotype either to maintain lean tissue homeostasis or drive inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity. However, the factors in the adipose tissue microenvironment that control ATM phenotypic polarization and bioenergetics remain unknown. We have recently shown that oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) uniquely regulate gene expression and cellular  in  macrophages, but the presence of the  phenotype in adipose tissue has not been reported. Here we show, using extracellular flux analysis, that ATMs isolated from lean mice are metabolically inhibited. We identify a unique population of CX3CR1/F4/80 ATMs that resemble the  (Txnrd1HO1) phenotype to be the predominant ATM phenotype in lean adipose tissue. In contrast, ATMs isolated from obese mice had characteristics typical of the / (CD11cCD206) phenotype with highly activated bioenergetics. Quantifying individual OxPL species in the stromal vascular fraction of murine adipose tissue, using targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, revealed that high  diet-induced adipose tissue expansion led to a disproportional increase in full-length over truncated OxPL species. In vitro studies showed that macrophages respond to truncated OxPL species by suppressing bioenergetics and up-regulating antioxidant programs, mimicking the  phenotype of ATMs isolated from lean mice. Conversely, full-length OxPL species induce proinflammatory gene expression and an activated bioenergetic profile that mimics ATMs isolated from obese mice. Together, these data identify a redox-regulatory Mox macrophage phenotype to be predominant in lean adipose tissue and demonstrate that individual OxPL species that accumulate in adipose tissue instruct ATMs to adapt their phenotype and bioenergetic profile to either maintain redox homeostasis or to promote inflammation.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

Dairy products differ in nutrient content and food matrix, and little is known about how different dairy products affect postprandial triglyceride (TG) concentrations.We investigated the effect of meals with similar amounts of  from different dairy products on postprandial TG concentrations over 6 h in healthy adults.A randomized controlled cross-over study was performed on 47 subjects (30% men), with median (25th-75th percentile) age of 32 (25-46) y and body mass index of 23.6 (21.0-25.8) kg/. Meals included 1 of butter, cheese, whipped cream, or sour cream, corresponding to 45 g of  (approximately 60 energy%). Serum concentrations of TGs (primary outcome), and total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL cholesterol), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL cholesterol), insulin, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, and plasma glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (secondary outcomes) were measured before the meal and 2, 4, and 6 h postprandially. Incremental AUC (iAUC) was calculated for the responses, and data were analyzed using a linear mixed model.Sour cream induced a 61% larger TG-iAUC0-6 h compared to whipped cream (P < 0.001), a 53% larger TG-iAUC0-6 h compared to butter (P < 0.001), and a 23% larger TG-iAUC0-6 h compared to cheese (P = 0.05). No differences in TG-iAUC0-6 h between the other meals were observed. Intake of sour cream induced a larger HDL cholesterol-iAUC0-6 h compared to cheese (P = 0.01). Intake of cheese induced a 124% larger insulin iAUC0-6 h compared to butter (P = 0.006). No other meal effects were observed.High- meals containing similar amount of  from different dairy products induce different postprandial effects on serum TGs, HDL cholesterol, and insulin in healthy adults.

Sarcopenia (loss of muscle bulk and strength) and frailty are geriatric syndromes that are likewise associated with adverse health outcomes, yet have received scant attention in PD. We studied body composition, sarcopenia, frailty, and their clinico-biological correlates in PD.93 patients and 78 spousal/sibling controls underwent comprehensive assessment of diet, clinical status, muscle strength/performance, frailty, body composition (using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), and serum levels of neurogastrointestinal hormones and inflammatory markers.PD patients were older than controls (66.0 ± 8.5 vs. 62.4 ± 8.4years, P = 0.003). Mean body mass index (24.0 ± 0.4 vs. 25.6 ± 0.5kg/, P = 0.016),  mass index (7.4 ± 0.3 vs. 9.0 ± 0.3kg/, P<0.001), and whole-body  percentage (30.7 ± 0.8 vs. 35.7 ± 0.9%, P<0.001) were lower in patients, even after controlling for age and gender. There were no between-group differences in skeletal muscle mass index and whole-body bone mineral density. Body composition parameters did not correlate with disease duration or motor severity. Reduced whole-body  percentage was associated with higher risk of motor response complications as well as higher levels of insulin-growth factor-1 and inflammatory markers. PD patients had a higher prevalence of sarcopenia (17.2% vs. 10.3%, P = 0.340) and frailty (69.4% vs. 24.2%, P = 0.010). Older age and worse PD motor severity were predictors of frailty in PD.We found reduced body  with relatively preserved skeletal muscle mass, and a high prevalence of frailty, in PD.

FGF21 is highly expressed in liver while FGF21 receptors (beta-klotho (KLB) and FGFR1c) are highly expressed in white adipose tissues (WATs). Plasma FGF21 has been shown to be increased after 7–10 days of fasting but oppositely plasma FGF21 is also increased in obesity. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of 60 h of fasting on plasma FGF21 levels in obese and lean subjects and to determine the gene expression of KLB and FGFR1c in the subcutaneous WAT before, during and after 60 h of fasting. Eight obese (BMI >30 kg/) and seven lean subjects (BMI <25 kg/) were fasted for 60 h and blood samples were taken at time 0 and after 12, 36 and 60 h of fasting. A biopsy from the subcutaneous WAT was taken at time 0, 12 and 60 h of fasting. FGF21 was measured in plasma by an ELISA and mRNA expression of KLB and FGFR1c was measured in WAT by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The fast significantly decreased plasma FGF21 in obese subjects while no change in plasma FGF21 was observed in lean subjects. Interestingly, KLB was significantly decreased in WAT in response to fasting in both lean and obese subjects indicating a potential important adaptive regulation of KLB in response to fasting.2018 Society for Endocrinology</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30122557>CXCL14, a Brown Adipokine that Mediates Brown--to-Macrophage Communication in Thermogenic Adaptation.</a></h2><p>The beneficial effects of brown adipose tissue (BAT) are attributed to its capacity to oxidize metabolites and produce heat, but recent data suggest that secretory properties of BAT may also be involved. Here, we identify the chemokine CXCL14 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-14) as a novel regulatory factor secreted by BAT in response to thermogenic activation.

Healthcare providers underdiagnose or misdiagnose lipedema as obesity or lymphedema. Materials and methods The benefits (friend) and negative aspects (foe) of lipedema were collected from published literature, discussions with women with lipedema, and institutional review board approved evaluation of medical charts of 46 women with lipedema. Results Lipedema is a foe because lifestyle change does not reduce lipedema , the  is painful, can become obese, causes gait and joint abnormalities, fatigue, lymphedema and psychosocial distress. Hypermobility associated with lipedema can exacerbate joint disease and aortic disease. In contrast, lipedema  can be a friend as it is associated with relative reductions in obesity-related metabolic dysfunction. In new data collected, lipedema was associated with a low risk of diabetes (2%), dyslipidemia (11.7%) and hypertension (13%) despite an obese average body mass index (BMI) of 35.3 ± 1.7 kg/. Conclusion Lipedema is a painful psychologically distressing  disorder, more foe than friend especially due to associated obesity and lymphedema.

We hypothesized that physiologic factors such as low energy expenditure and physical activity would be present in AA compared with white women in pregnancy.We aimed to identify physiologic risk factors for disordered energy balance in AA and white women early in pregnancy.This was a cross-sectional study in 66 pregnant women with obesity, between 14 and 16 wk of gestation. Energy intake was calculated using the intake-balance method. Energy expenditure was measured in free-living conditions [total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)] over 7 d with the use of doubly labelled water and during sleep [sleeping EE (SleepEE)] in a room calorimeter. Body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography and physical activity by accelerometers. Markers of metabolic health were obtained from fasting blood and urine.AA (n = 34) and white (n = 32) women were comparable in age (mean ± SEM: 27.7 ± 0.6 y), enrollment body mass index [mean ± SEM (in kg/): 36.9 ± 0.7], and body  (mean ± SEM: 45.0% ± 0.6%). AA women had more -free mass (P = 0.01) and tended to be more insulin-resistant (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, P = 0.06). Energy intake was significantly lower in AA than in white women (2499 ± 76 compared with 2769 ± 58 kcal/d, P = 0.001), although absolute TDEE was comparable (AA: 2590 ± 77 kcal/d; white: 2711 ± 56 kcal/d; P = 0.21). After adjusting for body composition, TDEE was significantly lower in AA women (-231 ± 74 kcal/d, P = 0.003), as was SleepEE (-81 ± 37 kcal/d, P = 0.03). Physical activity, substrate oxidation, and metabolic biomarkers (triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations, catecholamine excretion) were not significantly different between groups.Body mass-adjusted energy expenditure is significantly lower in AA than in white pregnant women. Energy intake recommendations for pregnancy do not consider this difference and may therefore overestimate energy requirements in AA women. This may lead to unintentional overeating and contribute to the disparity of excess gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention that is more prevalent in AA women.

The diverse phenotypes and complex autophagy in macrophage are observed in atherosclerotic lesions. Tanshinone IIA (TNA) is known as the major component extracted from the root of Chinese herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, used for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, the therapeutic mechanism of TNA is not clear yet. In this study, we identified inflammation-related gene expression by microarray in atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE knockout mice fed with high  diet and found miR-375 was one of the significantly high expressed microRNAs compared with wild type mice and TNA treated mice. Then we compared the levels of proteins related to the signal pathway of autophagy, and the phenotype of macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques ex vivo. We predicted KLF4 might be the key target of miR-375 that mediated the crosstalk between autophagy and polarization by TNA. Furthermore, we detected the expression of signal pathway in ox-LDL induced macrophages after treatment with TNA in vitro to verify this predict. The results suggest TNA could activate KLF4 and enhance autophagy as well as  polarization of macrophages by inhibiting miR-375 to Attenuate Atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

A disturbance in the regulation of energy  can be a key reason for the formation of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction leads to oxidative stress, which increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines. In this regard, the aim of this study was to identify the relationship of the copy number of mtDNA in adipose tissue from different locations (subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), mesentery (Mes), greater omentum (GO)), liver biopsy samples and mononuclear blood cells (MNCs) with endothelial dysfunction markers (eNOS, ET-1, iCAM-1, vCAM-1, VEGF) and inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, CRP, leptin) in obese patients (body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m) with and without type 2 diabetes.The study included 88 obese patients (BMI > 35 kg/) treated at the Kaliningrad Region Hospital. The control group consisted of 20 healthy donors. To measure mtDNA copy number we used droplet digital PCR. The concentrations of molecules (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, eNOS, ET-1, iCAM-1, vCAM-1, VEGF) were measured in plasma using the following sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Quantitative determination of leptin was evaluated by flow-fluorimetry on a «Bio-Plex Protein Assay System». Statistical analysis and graphs were obtained in R Statistical Software (version 3.3.1).The systemic character of chronic subclinical inflammation in obesity is established, and an increase in the level of endothelial dysfunction molecules was observed in the blood plasma. The levels of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-8 were positively correlated with increases in BMI, serum glucose and cholesterol levels.The copy number of mtDNA in various  stores was higher in obese patients with type 2 diabetes than in obese patients without diabetes or in the control subjects and was related to the levels of leptin and proinflammatory cytokines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30238979>Exercise rescues the immune response fine-tuned impaired by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ deletion in macrophages.</a></h2><p>Exercise is a powerful tool for prevention and treatment of many conditions related to the cardiovascular system and also chronic low-grade inflammation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ (PPARγ) exerts an import role on the regulation of metabolic profile and subsequent inflammatory response, especially in macrophages.To investigate the effects of 8-week moderate-exercise training on metabolic and inflammatory parameters in mice with PPARγ deficiency in myeloid cells.Twelve-week old mice bearing PPARγ deletion exclusively in myeloid cells (PPARγlox/lox Lys Cre  , knockout [KO]) and littermate controls (PPARγlox/lox Lys Cre  , wild type [WT]) were submitted to 8-week exercise training (treadmill running at moderate intensity, 5 days/week). Animals were evaluated for food intake, glucose homeostasis, serum metabolites, adipose tissue and peritoneal macrophage inflammation, and basal and stimulated cytokine secretion.Exercise protocol did not improve glucose  or adiponectin concentrations in serum of KO mice. Moreover, the absence of PPARγ in macrophages exacerbated the proinflammatory profile in sedentary mice. Peritoneal cultured cells had higher tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion in nonstimulated and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated conditions and higher Toll-4 receptor (TLR4) gene expression under LPS stimulus. Trained mice showed reduced TNF-α content in adipose tissue independently of the genotype.  polarization ability was impaired in KO peritoneal macrophages after exercise training, while adipose tissue-associated macrophages did not present any effect by PPARγ ablation.Overall, PPARγ seems necessary to maintain macrophages appropriate response to inflammatory stimulus and macrophage polarization, affecting also whole body  and adiponectin profile. Exercise training showed as an efficient mechanism to restore the immune response impaired by PPARγ deletion in macrophages.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30365498>Proteome and microbiota analysis reveals alterations of liver-gut axis under different stocking density of Peking ducks.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to determine the impact of stocking density on the liver proteome and cecal microbiota of Peking ducks. A total of 1,200 21-day-old ducks were randomly assigned to 5 stocking density groups of 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 ducks/, with 6 replicates for each group. At 40 days of age, duck serum and pectorals were collected for biochemical tests; liver and cecal contents of ducks were gathered for proteome and microbiota analysis, respectively. Serum MDA increased while pectorals T-AOC reduced linearly with enhancing stocking density. Duck  was altered under different stocking density as well. Serum LDL-C increased linearly with increasing stocking density. Proteome analysis revealed fatty acid biosynthesis proteins such as acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2 and fatty acid oxidation related proteins including acyl-CoA dehydrogenase long chain and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase were enriched in high stocking density group. Additionally, high stocking density increased oxidative response associated proteins such as DDRGK domain containing 1. Furthermore, increasing stocking density diminished proteins of anti-oxidant capacity including regucalcin and catalase. 16S rDNA analysis revealed that higher stocking density was accompanied with decreased microbial diversity, as well as depletion of anti-inflammatory bacterial taxa, including Bacteroidales, Butyricimonas and Alistipe. Besides, reduced bile acid -associated bacteria such as Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales and Desulfovibrionaceae were found in the high-density group.

However, PUFA purities, caloric content, and ratios in different diets may affect the results. By using -1 mice which convert n-6 to n-3 PUFAs in the brain, this study further evaluated anti-depressant mechanisms of n-3 PUFAs in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced model. Adult male -1 and wild-type (WT) mice were fed soybean oil diet for 8 weeks. Depression-like behaviors were measured 24 h after saline or LPS central administration. In WT littermates, LPS reduced sucrose intake, but increased immobility in forced-swimming and tail suspension tests. Microglial M1 phenotype CD11b expression and concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-17 were elevated, while  phenotype-related IL-4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 were decreased. LPS also reduced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine receptor kinase B (Trk B), while increasing glial fibrillary acidic protein expression and pro-BDNF, p75, NO, and iNOS levels. In -1 mice, LPS-induced behavioral changes were attenuated, which were associated with decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines and reversed changes in p75, NO, iNOS, and BDNF. Gas chromatography assay confirmed increased n-3 PUFA levels and n-3/n-6 ratios in the brains of -1 mice. In conclusion, endogenous n-3 PUFAs may improve LPS-induced depression-like behavior through balancing M1 and -phenotypes and normalizing BDNF function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474632>[Role of Angiogenesis and Chronic Inflammation in  Hypertrophy in NASH Pathology].</a></h2><p>Tissue expansion and chronic inflammation in adipose tissue (AT) are closely related to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathology. Angiogenesis is initiated by the detachment of pericytes (PCs) from vessels in AT. This process is necessary for the development of AT in obesity. The detachment is caused by excessive platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) derived from M1-macrophages (Mφ) infiltrating obese AT. On the other hand, AT of tamoxifen-induced systemic PDGF receptor-β knockout mice showed decreased detachment of PCs from vessels in obesity, thereby attenuating hypertrophy of AT mediated by neoangiogenesis, resulting in protection from the development of chronic AT inflammation and systemic insulin resistance. The selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) inhibitor eplerenone (Ep) suppresses chronic inflammation in  and the liver, improves glucose and , and inhibits body weight and  mass gain in mice fed a high- diet. As a novel mechanism, Ep increases energy expenditure and suppresses  accumulation, thereby controlling the polarity of visceral AT Mφ from inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory  dominant. In addition, Ep directly inhibits the activation of signals 1 and 2 of NLRP3-inflammasomes in Mφ, which is an inflammatory mechanism closely involved in the development of NASH. Thus, we propose novel therapeutic approaches to NASH. Inhibition of PDGF receptor-β signaling prevents AT hypertrophy by regulating AT angiogenesis, and MR inhibitors directly suppress chronic inflammation in the AT and liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29718334>Low-Dose Levothyroxine Reduces Intrahepatic  Content in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

They are associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, autophagy, and insulin resistance. Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor, has been reported to show multiple biological activities beyond the antidiabetic property. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of sitagliptin on hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, inflammation, and autophagy and exploring the underlying molecular mechanism. In the current study, ob/ob mice, a mouse model of genetic obesity and diabetes, were administered via gavage with sitagliptin 50 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Changes in glycolipid , inflammatory responses, and autophagy in the liver were evaluated. Body weight gain,  metabolic disorder, and hepatic steatosis as well as systemic and hepatic insulin sensitivity in ob/ob mice were significantly attenuated after sitagliptin treatment. Furthermore, sitagliptin decreased inflammatory responses by regulating macrophage M1/ polarization and inhibiting the activities of NF-B and JNK. Moreover, sitagliptin increased the levels of phosphorylation of AMPK and decreased those of mTOR.

Ultrasonography of subcutaneous fat was performed for LH diagnostics in these diabetic patients. Than clinical significance of LH without visual and palpable changes was estimated. HbA1c level, fasting and postprandial glucose, episodes of hypoglycemia, body mass index (BMI) and scheme of insulinotherapy were evaluated at the moment of LH, after 3 and 6 months in all patients.After changing injection sites, good results were demonstrated by measuring glucose and HbA1c level. Thus fasting glucose decreased from 9.03±1.98 mmol/l to 7.11±0.95 mmol/l (p=0.023). Postprandial glucose reduced from 10.27±2.72 mmol/l to 9.34±1.21 mmol/l (p=0.011). HbA1c level reduced from 9.27±1.75% to 7.43±1.02% (p=0.002). Also BMI decreased from 33.75±3.49 kg/ to 30.5±2.96 kg/ (p=0.018).LH without visual and palpable changes could worsen compensation of glycemic control and leads to hypoglycemia and chronic Somogyi rebound. So, LH without visual and palpable is as important and clinically significant as classic LH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29601102>Frontline Science: Specialized proresolving  mediators inhibit the priming and activation of the macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome.</a></h2><p>The prototypic proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β plays a central role in innate immunity and inflammatory disorders. The formation of mature IL-1β from an inactive pro-IL-1β precursor is produced via nonconventional multiprotein complexes called the inflammasomes, of which the most common is the nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome composed by NLRP3, (ASC) apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), and caspase-1. Specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) promote resolution of inflammation, which is an essential process to maintain host health. SPMs prevent excessive inflammation by terminating the inflammatory response and returning to tissue homeostasis without immunosupression. This study tested the hypothesis that modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages is one mechanism involved in the SPM-regulated processes during resolution. Our findings demonstrate that the SPM resolvin D2 (RvD2) suppressed the expression of pro-IL-1β and reduced the secretion of mature IL-1β in bone marrow-derived macrophages challenged with LPS+ATP (classical NLRP3 inflammasome model) or LPS+palmitate (lipotoxic model). Similar findings were observed in thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages, in which RvD2 remarkably reduced ASC oligomerization, inflammasome assembly, and caspase-1 activity. In vivo, in a self-resolving zymosan A-induced peritonitis model, RvD2 blocked the NLRP3 inflammasome leading to reduced release of IL-1β into the exudates, repression of osteopontin, and MCP-1 expression and induction of  markers of resolution (i.e., CD206 and arginase-1) in peritoneal macrophages. RvD2 inhibitory actions were receptor mediated and were abrogated by a selective GPR18 antagonist. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that SPMs have the ability to inhibit the priming and to expedite the deactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages during the resolution process.©2018 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30526248>Centromere protein F (CENPF), a microtubule binding protein, modulates cancer  by regulating pyruvate kinase  phosphorylation signaling.</a></h2><p>Prostate cancer (PC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and is the second leading cause of male cancer-related death in North America. Metabolic adaptations in malignant PC cells play a key role in fueling the growth and progression of the disease. Unfortunately, little is known regarding these changes in cellular . Here, we demonstrate that centromere protein F (CENPF), a protein associated with the centromere-kinetochore complex and chromosomal segregation during mitosis, is mechanically linked to altered  and progression in PC. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we silenced the gene for CENPF in human PC3 cells. These cells were found to have reduced levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Silencing of CENPF also simultaneously improved sensitivity to anoikis-induced apoptosis. Mass spectrometry analysis of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins from CENPF knockout (CENPF) and control cells revealed that CENPF silencing increased inactive forms of pyruvate kinase , a rate limiting enzyme needed for an irreversible reaction in glycolysis. Furthermore, CENPF cells had reduced global bio-energetic capacity, acetyl-CoA production, histone acetylation, and , suggesting that CENPF is a critical regulator of cancer , potentially through its effects on mitochondrial functioning. Additional quantitative immunohistochemistry and imaging analyzes on a series of PC tumor microarrays demonstrated that CENPF expression is significantly increased in higher-risk PC patients. Based on these findings, we suggest the CENPF may be an important regulator of PC  through its role in the mitochondria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30577588>Identification of Fatty Acid Desaturase 6 in Golden Pompano  (Linnaeus 1758) and Its Regulation by the PPARαb Transcription Factor.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid desaturases are rate-limiting enzymes in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. The transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha b (PPARαb) regulates  in mammals, however, the mechanism whereby PPARαb regulates fatty acid desaturases is largely unknown in fish. In this study, we report the full length cDNA sequence of  fatty acid desaturase, which encodes a 380 amino acid polypeptide, possessing three characteristic histidine domains. Phylogenetic and gene exon/intron structure analyses showed typical phylogeny: the  fatty acid desaturase contained a highly conserved exon/intron architecture. Moreover, functional characterization by heterologous expression in yeast indicated that  desaturase was a fatty acid desaturase, with Δ4/Δ5/Δ8 Fad activity. Promoter activity assays indicated that  desaturase transcription was positively regulated by PPARαb. Similarly, PPARαb RNA interference decreased ToPPARαb and ToFads6 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in a time-dependent manner. Mutation analyses showed that the  binding site of PPARαb was functionally important for protein binding, and transcriptional activity of the  promoter was significantly decreased after targeted mutation of . Electrophoretic mobile shift assays confirmed that PPARαb interacted with the binding site of the  promoter region, to regulate  transcription. In summary, PPARαb played a vital role in  regulation and may promote the biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids by regulating  expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29546309>Supplementation with Resveratrol and Curcumin Does Not Affect the Inflammatory Response to a High- Meal in Older Adults with Abdominal Obesity: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Crossover Trial.</a></h2><p>High- meals induce postprandial inflammation. Resveratrol is a polyphenol known to prevent comorbidities associated with cardiovascular disease and exerts an anti-inflammatory action. There is also an increasing body of evidence supporting the role of curcumin, a polyphenol from the curcuminoid family, as a modulator of proinflammatory processes.The objectives of this study were to investigate the following: 1) the bioavailability of resveratrol consumed in combination with curcumin after consumption of a high- meal; and 2) the acute combined effects of this combination on the postprandial inflammatory response of subjects with abdominal obesity.In a double blind, crossover, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 11 men and 11 postmenopausal women [mean ± SD age: 62 ± 5 y; mean ± SD body mass index (in kg/): 29 ± 3] underwent a 6-h oral  tolerance test on 2 occasions separated by 1-2 wk: once after consumption of a dietary supplement (200 mg resveratrol and 100 mg curcumin, Res/Cur) and once after consumption of a placebo (cellulose). Plasma concentrations of total resveratrol and its major metabolites as well as inflammatory markers, adhesion molecules, and whole blood NFκB1 and PPARA gene expression were measured during both  tolerance tests.Kinetics of resveratrol and identified metabolites revealed rapid absorption patterns but also relatively limited bioavailability based on free resveratrol concentrations. Supplementation with Res/Cur did not modify postprandial variations in circulating inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and adhesion molecules [soluble E-selectin, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1] compared to placebo (PTreatment×Time > 0.05). However, Res/Cur significantly decreased the cumulative postprandial response of sVCAM-1, compared to placebo (incremental area under the curve -4643%, P = 0.01). Postprandial variations of whole-blood PPARA and NFKB1 gene expression were not different between Res/Cur and placebo treatments.Acute supplementation with Res/Cur has no impact on the postprandial inflammation response to a high- meal in abdominally obese older adults.

The present study was conducted to investigate transcriptomic responses in the liver and jejunal mucosa of pigs to evaluate the effects of different feeding frequencies on the body's . Twelve Duroc × Landrance × Yorkshire growing pigs with an average initial weight (IW) of 14.86 ± 0.20 kg were randomly assigned to two groups: feeding one time per day (M1) and feeding two times per day (); each group consisted of six replicates (pens), with one pig per pen. During the one-month experimental period, pigs in the M1 group were fed on an ad libitum basis at 8:00 am; and the  group was fed half of the standard feeding requirement at 8:00 am and adequate feed at 16:00 pm. The results showed that average daily feed intake, average daily gain, feed:gain, and the organ indices were not significantly different between the two groups ( > 0.05). The total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations in the serum, and the TG concentration in the liver in the  groups were significant lower than those in the M1 group, while the T-CHO concentration in the liver were significant higher in the  group ( < 0.05).

Even when skin excision is replaced by specific plastic surgery, treatment of the muscle radiation injury nonetheless remains difficult, for it involves a massive muscle defect in an unpredictable environment, subject to inflammatory waves weeks to months after irradiation, which delay healing and predispose the patient to the development of fibrous scar tissue. In this study, we investigated the long-term effect of local injections of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs), combined with plastic surgery, to treat muscle necrosis in a large animal model.Three months after irradiation to the rump, minipigs were treated by excision of necrotic muscle tissue, vascularized flap surgery, and four injections with or without local autologous BM-MSCs, performed weekly. The quality of the muscle wound healing was examined 1 year post-surgery.The skeletal muscle surgery without MSC treatment led to permanent deposition of collagen 1 and 3, decreased myofiber diameter, failed muscle fiber regeneration, a reduced number of capillaries, and the accumulation of high calcium and . In animals treated by surgery and MSC injections, these indicators were substantially better and demonstrated established regeneration. MSC therapy acts at several levels by stimulating growth factors such as VEGF, which is involved in angiogenesis and satellite cell pool maintenance, and creating a macrophage M1/ balance.Thus, cell therapy using BM-MSCs is an effective and safe way to improve recovery of irradiation-induced skeletal muscle damage without signs of long-term degeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30455376>HSPA12A Is a Novel Player in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis via Promoting Nuclear PKM2-Mediated M1 Macrophage Polarization.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most prevalent cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Macrophage-mediated inflammation plays a critical role in NASH pathogenesis; however, optimum therapies for macrophage activation and NASH remain elusive. HSPA12A encodes a novel member of the HSP70 family. Here, we report that NASH patients showed increased hepatic HSPA12A expression and serum HSPA12A contents. Intriguingly, knockout of HSPA12A ( ) in mice attenuated high- diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis and injury. HFD-induced macrophage polarization toward an M1 phenotype and inflammatory responses in the liver of  mice were also attenuated. Loss- and gain-of-function studies revealed that the de novo lipogenesis in hepatocytes was regulated by the paracrine effects of macrophage HSPA12A rather than by hepatocyte HSPA12A. In-depth molecular analysis revealed that HSPA12A interacted with the  isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) in macrophages and increased its nuclear translocation, thereby promoting M1 polarization and secretion of proinflammatory M1 cytokines; this led, ultimately, to hepatocyte steatosis via paracrine effects. Taken together, these findings show that HSPA12A acts as a novel regulator of M1 macrophage polarization and NASH pathogenesis by increasing nuclear PKM2. Strategies that inhibit macrophage HSPA12A might be a potential therapeutic intervention for NASH.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606998>Berberine, a Traditional Chinese Medicine, Reduces Inflammation in Adipose Tissue, Polarizes  Macrophages, and Increases Energy Expenditure in Mice Fed a High- Diet.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND The uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) gene has a role in mitochondrial energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue. This study aimed to investigate the effects of berberine, a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid used in traditional Chinese medicine, on energy expenditure, expression of the UCP1 gene, the cell stress protein inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), apoptosis genes, and macrophage phenotype (M1 and ) in white and brown adipose tissue in an obese mouse model fed a high- diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS Four-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (n=20) were divided into a high- diet group, a normal diet group, a group treated with berberine at 100 mg/kg/d in 0.9% normal saline, and a non-treated group. Whole-body  mass, blood glucose, insulin resistance, and oxygen expenditure during physical activity were measured. After 16 weeks, the mice were euthanized for examination of liver and adipose tissue. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis genes, thermogenic genes (including UCP1), and IRE1α, were investigated using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), in white and brown adipose tissue. Magnetic cell sorting harvested M1 and  macrophages in adipose tissue. Clodronate liposomes were used to inhibit macrophage recruitment. RESULTS Berberine treatment in mice fed a high- diet increased energy , glucose tolerance, and expression of UCP1, and reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, macrophage recruitment, and resulted in  macrophage polarization in white adipose tissue. Polarized  macrophages showed reduced expression of apoptotic genes and IRE1α.

Vegetable oils with varying unsaturated fatty acid profiles favorably affect multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors; however, their effects on cholesterol efflux remain unclear.The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of diets low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with varying unsaturated fatty acid profiles on serum-mediated cholesterol efflux and its association with the plasma lipophilic index and central obesity.The present study is a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding study. Participants [men: n = 50; women: n = 51; mean ± SE age: 49.5 ± 1.2 y; body mass index (in kg/): 29.4 ± 0.4] at risk for or with metabolic syndrome (MetS) were randomly assigned to 5 isocaloric diets containing the treatment oils: canola oil, high oleic acid-canola oil, DHA-enriched high oleic acid-canola oil, corn oil and safflower oil blend, and flax oil and safflower oil blend. These treatment oils were incorporated into smoothies that participants consumed 2 times/d. For a 3000-kcal diet, 60 g of treatment oil was required to provide 18% of total energy per day. Each diet period was 4 wk followed by a 2- to 4-wk washout period. We quantified cholesterol efflux capacity with a validated ex vivo high-throughput cholesterol efflux assay. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of the SAS mixed-model procedure.The 5 diets increased serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity from THP-1 macrophages similarly by 39%, 34%, 55%, 49% and 51%, respectively, compared with baseline (P < 0.05 for all). Waist circumference and abdominal adiposity were negatively correlated with serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity (r = -0.25, P = 0.01, r = -0.33, P = 0.02, respectively).Diets low in SFAs with different monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid profiles improved serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity in individuals with or at risk for MetS. This mechanism may account, in part, for the cardiovascular disease benefits of diets low in SFAs and high in unsaturated fatty acids. Importantly, central obesity is inversely associated with cholesterol efflux capacity.

Mechanistic researches demonstrate that the anti-diabetic effect of MSCs is partially mediated by eliciting macrophages into an anti-inflammatory phenotype thus alleviating insulin resistance. However, single MSC infusion is insufficient to ameliorate sustained hyperglycemia or normalize blood glucose levels. In this study, we used decitabine (DAC), which is involved in the regulation of macrophage polarization, to test whether MSCs combined with decitabine can prolong and enhance the anti-diabetic effect in T2D mice.High- diet (HFD) and streptozocin (STZ) were given to induce T2D mouse model. Successfully induced T2D mice were randomly divided into four groups: T2D group, MSC group, DAC group, and MSC + DAC group. Blood glucose was monitored, and glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were evaluated during the entire analysis period. Epididymal  was extracted for analysis of macrophage phenotype and inflammation in adipose tissue. In vitro, we examined the effect of MSC + DAC on macrophage polarization in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and explore the possible mechanism.MSC infusion effectively improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in T2D mice within 1 week, whereas combination therapy of MSCs + DAC extended the anti-diabetic effects of MSCs from 1 to 4 weeks (the end of the observation). Correspondingly, more  macrophages in adipose tissue were observed in the combination therapy group over the entire study period. In vitro, compared with the MSC group, MSCs combined with decitabine more effectively polarized M1 macrophages to  macrophages. Further analysis showed that the effect of MSC + DAC on macrophage polarization was largely abrogated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist GW9662.Our data suggest that MSCs combined with decitabine can more effectively alleviate insulin resistance and prolong and enhance the anti-diabetic effect of MSCs in T2D mice in part by prompting  polarization in a PPARγ-dependent manner. Thus, decitabine may be an applicable addition to MSCs for diabetes therapy. UC-MSCs combined with decitabine activate the IL4R/STAT6/STAT3/PPARγ axis to further promote  macrophage polarization in adipose tissue, reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and lead to better glucose  and long-term hypoglycemic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30020457>Youth With Type 1 Diabetes Have Adipose, Hepatic, and Peripheral Insulin Resistance.</a></h2><p>Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have difficulty obtaining optimal glucose control, which may relate to insulin resistance (IR), especially during puberty.

The number of BmCPV virions attached to the cell surface and the expression level of BmCPV vp1 gene was significantly decreased by digestion of terminal sialic acids in gangliosides with neuraminidase (NA). Preincubation of different concentration of ganglioside GM1, GM2 or GM3 with BmCPV prior to infection, the reduction of BmCPV infectivity was found by GM2-treated in a dose-depend manner. BmCPV virions were found to colocalize with GM2 in the cell surface. The infectivity of BmCPV was reduced by anti-GM2 antibody treatment cells. Moreover, BmCPV infection was impaired by depletion of membrane cholesterol with MβCD, but the inhibitory effect of MβCD was restored by supplementing with cholesterol. The number of viral particles attached on the BmN cells was significantly decreased by pretreated with MβCD, and BmCPV infection was inhibited by silencing the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase gene (Hmg-r) in cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. These results indicate that ganglioside GM2 and cholesterol in membrane  rafts are essential for BmCPV attachment to cell surface for its cell entry.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Although it has long been known that CL plays an important role in mitochondrial bioenergetics, recent evidence in the yeast model indicates that CL is also essential for intermediary . To gain insight into the function of CL in energy  in mammalian cells, here we analyzed the  flux of [U-C]glucose in a mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line, TAZ-KO, which is CL-deficient because of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the CL-remodeling enzyme tafazzin (TAZ). TAZ-KO cells exhibited decreased flux of [U-C]glucose to [C]acetyl-CoA and  and M4 isotopomers of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. The activity of pyruvate carboxylase, the predominant enzyme for anaplerotic replenishing of the TCA cycle, was elevated in TAZ-KO cells, which also exhibited increased sensitivity to the pyruvate carboxylase inhibitor phenylacetate. We attributed a decreased carbon flux from glucose to acetyl-CoA in the TAZ-KO cells to a ∼50% decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, which was observed in both TAZ-KO cells and cardiac tissue from TAZ-KO mice. Protein-lipid overlay experiments revealed that PDH binds to CL, and supplementing digitonin-solubilized TAZ-KO mitochondria with CL restored PDH activity to WT levels. Mitochondria from TAZ-KO cells exhibited an increase in phosphorylated PDH, levels of which were reduced in the presence of supplemented CL.

Although sarcopenia has multifactorial causes, it might be partly attributed to a blunted response to anabolic stimuli. Leucine acutely increases muscle protein synthesis, and resistance training (RT) is the strongest stimuli to counteract sarcopenia and was recently shown to improve insulin sensitivity (IS) in frail older women. Discrepancies exist regarding whether chronic supplementation of leucine in conjunction with RT can improve muscle mass and IS.The aim of this double-blinded placebo-controlled study was to determine the effects of leucine supplementation and RT on IS in prefrail and frail older women.Using the Fried criteria, 19 nondiabetic prefrail (1-2 criteria) and frail (≥3 criteria) older women (77.5 ± 1.3 y; body mass index (kg/): 25.1 ± 0.9) underwent a 3-mo intervention of RT 3 times/wk with protein-optimized diet of 1.2 g·kg-1·d-1 and 7.5 g·d-1 of l-leucine supplementation compared with placebo l-alanine. Pre-/postintervention primary outcomes were fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin, and 4-h responses to a standard meal of complete liquid formula.

However, the contribution of HI mediated ATI and its metabolic consequences are yet to be explored. We induced chronic HI per se in mice by administration of exogenous insulin for 8 weeks through mini-osmotic pumps. For the reduction of circulating insulin in response to excess calorie intake, we have partially ablated β-cells by using streptozotocin (STZ) in the diet-induced obesity (DIO) and genetic mice models (db/db). Flow cytometry analysis was performed for the quantification of immune cells in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolated from epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). Our studies demonstrated that chronic HI augmented ATI in terms of elevated pro-inflammatory cells (M1 macrophages and NK-cells) and suppressed anti-inflammatory cells ( macrophages, eosinophils and regulatory T-cells). These results were correlated with altered obesity-associated metabolic phenotype. Partial reduction of circulating insulin level attenuated excess calorie-induced ATI and improved insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, an imbalance in M1 and  macrophage proportions in eWAT promoted iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase): arginase-1 imbalance that resulted into extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and insulin resistance (IR) development. However, iNOS mice were protected from HI-induced M1: macrophage imbalance, ECM deposition and IR in adipose tissue. Overall, we conclude that chronic HI per se contributed in ATI and iNOS corroborated ECM deposition.Copyright © 2018.

The efficacy and safety were compared between the 2 groups.None in both groups died and had severe postoperative complications. All the surgeries were performed by laparoscopy, and none received switching to open surgery. Patients received regular follow-up after surgery and none were lost to follow-up.Our study indicates LDJB-LSG is similar to LRYGB in the improvements of the body weight, blood glucose, insulin resistance, islet β cell function, blood  profile and serum uric acid, and thus LDJB-LSG is applicable in T2DM patients with 27.5 kg/m ≤ BMI ≤ 32.5 kg/m and risk for gastric cancer.

It is known that tumors have altered , but the metabolic changes in normal or cancer-adjacent, nonmalignant normal tissues and how these changes relate to alterations in gene expression and histological composition are not well understood. Normal or cancer-adjacent normal breast tissues from 99 women of the Normal Breast Study (NBS) were evaluated. Data of metabolomics, gene expression and histological composition was collected by mass spectrometry, whole genome microarray, and digital image, respectively. Unsupervised clustering analysis determined metabolomics-derived subtypes. Their association with genomic and histological features, as well as other breast cancer risk factors, genomic and histological features were evaluated using logistic regression. Unsupervised clustering of metabolites resulted in two main clusters. The metabolite differences between the two clusters suggested enrichment of pathways involved in , cell growth and proliferation, and migration. Compared with Cluster 1, subjects in Cluster 2 were more likely to be obese (body mass index ≥30 kg/, p<0.05), have increased adipose proportion (p<0.01) and associated with a previously defined Active genomic subtype (p<0.01). By the integrated analyses of histological, metabolomics and transcriptional data, we characterized two distinct subtypes of non-malignant breast tissue. Further research is needed to validate our findings, and understand the potential role of these alternations in breast cancer initiation, progression and recurrence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29899524>MicroRNA-30 modulates metabolic inflammation by regulating Notch signaling in adipose tissue macrophages.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a pandemic disorder that is characterized by accumulation of adipose tissue and chronic low-grade inflammation that is driven primarily by adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). While ATM polarization from pro-(M1) to anti-() inflammatory phenotype influences insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure, the mechanisms of such a switch are unclear. In the current study, we identified epigenetic pathways including microRNAs (miR) in ATMs that regulate obesity-induced inflammation.Male C57BL/6J mice were fed normal chow diet (NCD) or high- diet (HFD) for 16 weeks to develop lean and diet-induced obese mice, respectively. Transcriptome microarrays, microRNA microarrays, and MeDIP-Seq were performed on ATMs isolated from visceral . Pathway analysis and bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) transfections further allowed computational and functional analysis of miRNA-mediated ATM polarization.ATMs from HFD-fed mice were skewed toward M1 inflammatory phenotype. Concurrently, the expression of miRs 30a-5p, 30c-5p, and 30e-5p was downregulated in ATMs from HFD mice when compared to mice fed NCD. The miR-30 family was shown to target Delta-like-4, a Notch1 ligand, whose expression was increased in HFD ATMs. Inhibition of miR-30 in conditioned BMDM triggered Notch1 signaling, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and M1 macrophage polarization. In addition, DNA hypermethylation was observed in mir30-associated CpG islands, suggesting that HFD downregulates miR-30 through epigenetic modifications.HFD-induced obesity downregulates miR-30 by DNA methylation thereby inducing Notch1 signaling in ATMs and their polarization to M1 macrophages. These findings identify miR-30 as a regulator of pro-inflammatory ATM polarization and suggest that miR-30 manipulation could be a therapeutic target for obesity-induced inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29901782>Bariatric Surgery Does Not Appear to Affect Women's Breast-Milk Composition.</a></h2><p>The breast-milk composition in the first 6 wk postpartum of women who have undergone bariatric surgery (BS) is unknown.The aim of this study was to examine 1) the breast-milk macronutrient and vitamin A composition in women who had and who had not undergone BS and 2) the impact of maternal diet on the breast-milk composition. We hypothesized that the milk of women who had undergone BS would be less energy dense and have a lower vitamin A concentration than that of other women.A multicenter prospective substudy was conducted at 2 university hospitals. Breast-milk samples were collected from 24 normal-weight [NW; mean ± SD body mass index (BMI; kg/): 21.5 ± 1.7; mean ± SD age: 29 ± 6 y], 39 overweight (OW; BMI: 26.9 ± 1.5; aged 29 ± 5 y), and 12 obese women (BMI: 35.0 ± 5.7; aged 29 ± 5 y) as well as from 11 women who had undergone BS (BMI: 28.0 ± 4.4; aged 30 ± 4 y) from day 3 until week 6 of lactation. Milk energy and macronutrients (Human Milk Analyzer; Miris) and vitamin A concentrations (iCheck Fluoro; BioAnalyt) were determined at the end of each week. Maternal diet (food-frequency questionnaire) and physical activity (Kaiser Physical Activity Survey) were measured during the third trimester of pregnancy and on day 3 or 4 and during week 6 of lactation. Statistical analyses include 1-factor ANOVA, Spearman and Pearson correlations, and multiple linear regression.In all women, a weekly increase in milk energy, total , and total carbohydrates was seen, whereas a weekly decrease in proteins and vitamin A was found during the first 2 wk of lactation, followed by a stable concentration of all nutrients. At week 4, milk protein concentrations were higher in women who had undergone BS (14 g/L) compared with NW (8 g/L; P = 0.005) and OW (9 g/L; P = 0.019) women. At week 5, milk carbohydrate concentrations were higher in women who had undergone BS (74 g/L) compared with NW women (68 g/L; P = 0.042).Breast milk of women who have undergone BS appears to be adequate in energy, macronutrients, and vitamin A during the first 6 wk of lactation. This supports the conclusion that breast feeding should not be discouraged in this group of women.

After anesthesia with chloral hydrate, the mice were administered 50 μL saline or dust solution by intratracheal instillation (Control group: 50 μL saline; Test group: 15 mg kg MWCNTs). Mice were injected with these doses once a week for 13 weeks. Then, male and female mice in the same group were allowed to mate to produce offspring. The pups were fed with normal diet until the end of the experiment (12 weeks old). The offspring mice were sacrificed by decapitation to detect the blood biochemistry and the expression of genes and proteins. : Compared with the Control group, MWCNTs significantly reduced the weight of offspring mice (male and female) and led to histopathological changes in the liver tissues. The expression of liver  synthesis gene significantly increased ( < 0.05 or  < 0.01). The expression of genes and proteins involved in the inflammatory reactions appeared to be abnormal ( < 0.05 or  < 0.01). : Exposure of adult mice to MWCNTs can affect the expression of fatty acid synthesis genes in the liver tissues of offspring mice, leading to disruption of liver function and accumulation of  droplets in the hepatocytes.

Maximal strength was assessed by 1-repetition-maximum (1RM) strength testing, and muscle hypertrophy was assessed at the whole-body (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), upper leg (computed tomography scan), and muscle fiber (biopsy) levels. Muscle protein synthesis rates were assessed during week 12 of training with the use of deuterated water (2H2O) administration.Leg-extension 1RM increased in both groups (placebo: 88 ± 3 to 104 ± 4 kg; protein: 85 ± 3 to 102 ± 4 kg; P < 0.001), with no differences between groups.

The comparative effects of amantadine ( Amt) and its synthetic spiro[pyrrolidine-2,2'-adamantane] (AK13) analogue in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayers were studied using a combination of experimental biophysical methods, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction, solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. All three experimental methods pointed out that the two analogues perturbed drastically the DMPC bilayers with AK13 to be more effective at high concentrations. AK13 was tolerated in  bilayers at very high concentrations, while Amt was crystallized. This is an important consideration in the formulations of drugs as it designates a limitation of Amt incorporation. MD simulations verify provided details about the strong interactions of the drugs in the interface region between phosphoglycerol backbone and lipophilic segments.

Besides alcohol consumption, energy-containing nonalcoholic beverages may contribute to liver fat accumulation.We aimed to study the consumption of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages and their mutual replacement in relation to hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC) in middle-aged men and women.In this cross-sectional analysis, HTGC was assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Habitual consumption of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages was assessed using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. All beverages were converted to standard servings and to percentage of total energy intake (En%). We performed linear regression to examine the association of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages with HTGC, adjusted for age, sex, smoking, education, ethnicity, physical activity, total energy intake, and total body fat. We studied replacement of alcoholic beverages with nonalcoholic beverages per 1 serving/d and per 5 En%/d.After exclusion of individuals with missing values, 1966 participants (47% men) were analyzed, with a mean ± SD age of 55 ± 6 y, BMI of 26 ± 4 kg/, and HTGC of 5.7% ± 7.9%. Each extra alcoholic serving per day was associated with more liver fat (1.09 times; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.12). Replacing 5 En% of alcoholic beverages with milk was associated with less liver fat (0.89 times; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), whereas replacement with 5 En% of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with liver fat to an extent similar to alcoholic beverages (1.00 times; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.09).In a population-based cohort, consumption of each extra daily alcoholic beverage was associated with more liver fat. In isocaloric replacement of alcoholic beverages, milk was associated with less liver fat, whereas sugar-sweetened beverages were equally associated with liver fat. This suggests that intake of alcohol and sugars may contribute to liver fat accumulation.

Here, we studied the structure of a member of the Cys-loop ligand gated ion channel protein superfamily of receptors, human type A γαβαβ gamma amino butyric acid receptor complex in a  bilayer environment. Studying the correlation between the structure and function of the gamma amino butyric acid receptor may enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of ion channel dysfunctions linked with epilepsy, ataxia, migraine, schizophrenia and other neurodegenerative diseases. The structure of human γαβαβ has been modeled based on the X-ray structure of the Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel via homology modeling. The template provided the first inhibitory channel structure for the Cys-loop superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels. The only available template structure before this glutamate-gated chloride channel was a cation selective channel which had very low sequence identity with gamma aminobutyric acid receptor. Here, our aim was to study the effect of structural corrections originating from modeling on a more reliable template structure. The homology model was analyzed for structural properties via a 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) study. Due to the structural shifts and the removal of an open channel potentiator molecule, ivermectin, from the template structure, helical packing changes were observed in the transmembrane segment. Namely removal of ivermectin molecule caused a closure around the Leu 9 position along the ion channel. In terms of the structural shifts, there are three potential disulfide bridges between the M1 and M3 helices of the γ and 2 α subunits in the model. The effect of these disulfide bridges was investigated via monitoring the differences in root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of individual amino acids and principal component analysis of the MD trajectory of the two homology models-one with the disulfide bridge and one with protonated Cys residues. In all subunit types, RMSF of the transmembrane domain helices are reduced in the presence of disulfide bridges. Additionally, loop A, loop F and loop C fluctuations were affected in the extracellular domain. In cross-correlation analysis of the trajectory, the two model structures displayed different coupling in between the -M3 linker region, protruding from the membrane, and the β1-β2/D loop and cys-loop regions in the extracellular domain. Correlations of the C loop, which collapses directly over the bound ligand molecule, were also affected by differences in the packing of transmembrane helices. Finally, more localized correlations were observed in the transmembrane helices when disulfide bridges were present in the model. The differences observed in this study suggest that dynamic coupling at the interface of extracellular and ion channel domains differs from the coupling introduced by disulfide bridges in the transmembrane region. We hope that this hypothesis will be tested experimentally in the near future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735438>Targeting biosynthetic networks of the proinflammatory and proresolving  metabolome.</a></h2><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs interfere with the  of arachidonic acid to proinflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes by targeting cyclooxygenases (COXs), 5-lipoxygenase (LOX), or the 5-LOX-activating protein (FLAP). These and related enzymes act in conjunction with marked crosstalk within a complex  mediator (LM) network where also specialized proresolving LMs (SPMs) are formed. Here, we present how prominent LM pathways can be differentially modulated in human proinflammatory M1 and proresolving  macrophage phenotypes that, upon exposure to , produce either abundant prostaglandins and leukotrienes (M1) or SPMs (). Targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based metabololipidomics was applied to analyze and quantify the specific LM profiles. Besides expected on-target actions, we found that: ) COX or 15-LOX-1 inhibitors elevate inflammatory leukotriene levels, ) FLAP and 5-LOX inhibitors reduce leukotrienes in M1 but less so in  macrophages, ) zileuton blocks resolution-initiating SPM biosynthesis, whereas FLAP inhibition increases SPM levels, and ) that the 15-LOX-1 inhibitor 3887 suppresses SPM formation in  macrophages. Conclusively, interference with discrete LM biosynthetic enzymes in different macrophage phenotypes considerably affects the LM metabolomes with potential consequences for inflammation-resolution pharmacotherapy. Our data may allow better appraisal of the therapeutic potential of these drugs to intervene with inflammatory disorders.-Werner, M., Jordan, P.

Furthermore, others similarities between metabolic syndrome (visceral obesity, elevated blood glucose levels, dyslipidemia) and Cushing's syndrome suggest that GCs could play a role in obesity-linked complications. Here we reported that long-term corticosterone (CORT) exposure in mice induced weight gain, dyslipidemia as well as hyperglycaemia and systemic insulin resistance. CORT-treated mice exhibited an increased 11β-Hsd1 expression and corticosterone levels in  depots but a specific upregulation of glucocorticoid receptor (Gr) and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase only in gonadal adipose tissue, suggesting that GC could act differentially on various  depots. Despite  accumulation in all depots, an increased expression of adipogenic (Pparγ, C/ebpα) and lipogenic (Acc, Fas) key genes was restricted to gonadal adipose tissue. Hypertrophied adipocytes observed in both visceral and subcutaneous depots also resulted from reduced lipolytic activity due to CORT treatment. Surprisingly, GC treatment promoted macrophage infiltration (F4/80, Cd68) within all adipose tissues along with predominant -like macrophage phenotype, and can directly act on macrophages to induce this phenotype. Moreover, macrophage infiltration preceded mass gain and adipocyte hypertrophy. Of note, specific macrophage depletion in gonadal  preferentially reduced the -like macrophage content, and partially restored insulin sensitivity in mice with GC-induced obesity and insulin resistance. These data provide evidence that GCs act on adipose tissue in a depot-dependent manner and that gonadal adipose macrophages are key effectors of GC-associated insulin resistance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

REE was measured (REEm) with indirect calorimetry. Predicted REE (REEp) was determined via 1) a best-fit linear regression developed with the use of REEm, age, sex, -free mass, and  mass from our control groups and 2) three standard predictive equations.REEm in WLMs was accurately predicted by equations developed from NCs and OCs (±1%) and by 3 standard predictive equations (±3%). In WLMs, individual differences between REEm and REEp ranged from -257 to +163 kcal/d. A lower REEm compared with REEp was correlated with amount of weight lost (r = 0.36, P < 0.05) but was not correlated with duration of weight-loss maintenance (r = 0.04, P = 0.81).We found no consistent evidence of a significantly lower REE than predicted in a sample of long-term WLMs based on predictive equations developed from NCs and OCs as well as 3 standard predictive equations. Results suggest that sustained weight loss may not always result in a substantial, disproportionately low REE.

The classically activated M1 macrophages are key players in the initiation and maintenance of adipose tissue (AT) inflammation. The role of NFATc3 in obesity and AT inflammation is unknown. We set out to determine how deficiency of NFATc3 effected macrophage polarization, inflammation and insulin resistance in visceral adipose tissue of high  diet (HFD)-fed mice. Nfatc3-/- and wild type (WT) mice were fed a HFD for 8 to 17 weeks. Epididymal white AT (eWAT) F4/80(+) cells were characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and quantitative RT-PCR. Results showed that Nfatc3-/- mice developed HFD-induced obesity similar to WT mice, but insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were improved, and liver  accumulation was reduced in Nfatc3-/- mice compared to WT control mice. Moreover, M1 macrophage content and proinflammatory factors were reduced whereas the alternatively activated  macrophage content was increased in eWAT of HFD-fed Nfatc3-/- mice compared to that of WT mice. In addition, eWAT insulin signaling was improved in HFD-fed Nfatc3-/- mice. Importantly, after bone-marrow-derived macrophages had been isolated from Nfatc3-/- mice and cultured in vitro, treatment of these cells with interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide resulted in reduction of M1 inflammatory markers, suggesting that NFATc3 promoted M1 polarization by a cell-autonomous mechanism. The results demonstrated that NFATc3 played an important role in M1 macrophage polarization, adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in response to obesity through transcriptional activation of proinflammatory genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29672576>Malnutrition and  abnormalities in antiretroviral naïve HIV-infected adults in Addis Ababa: A cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Both under- and over-nutrition may occur among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and impact on the course of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and its management due to the close interaction between immunity and nutrition. We investigated occurrence of undernutrition, excess weight and  abnormalities among antiretroviral naïve HIV-infected adults in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study on 594 antiretroviral therapy (ART) naïve HIV-infected adults was conducted in four hospitals in Addis Ababa from February to September 2013. Hematological parameters (CD4+ T cell count and hemoglobin concentration), fasting serum glucose, total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) were determined. Information on socio-demographic, anthropometric and World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stages was collected from patient clinical records, and triangulated by structured questionnaire. Height and weight measurements were taken and body mass index (BMI), undernutrition (BMI <18.5 kg/) and excess weight (BMI ≥25 kg/) determined. Statistical comparisons were made to identify significant factors associated with nutritional status and  profiles.The prevalence of undernutrition was 15.1%, and the prevalence of excess weight was 22.1%, including 5.4% who were obese. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia was 16.6% and it was higher in women (18.9%) than in men (11.0%) (p<0.05). However, the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia was 29.8%. There was significant positive Spearman correlation between CD4+ T cell count and serum TC (r = 0.210, p<0.001), but no correlation was observed between CD4+ T cell count and TG (r = -0.007, p>0.05). Age categories 30-39 and 40-79, and WHO clinical stages III/IV for undernutrition; age categories 30-39 and 40-79, WHO clinical stages III/IV and TC ≥200 mg/dL for excess weight; and being female, age categories 30-39 and 40-79, and hypertriglyceridemia for hypercholesterolemia were found to be independent predictors by binomial logistic regression analysis.Undernutrition, excess weight, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia were variably prevalent in ART naïve HIV-infected populations. This emphasizes the need for targeted nutritional programs as an integral part of HIV/AIDS care.  levels need to be monitored regularly in patients whether on or off ART.

Proteins have glucagon and insulinotropic effects, which may differ depending on amino acid composition, form of intake, and rate of digestibility and absorption.The aim of this study was to test effects of isolated pea protein-based (PP) compared with casein protein-based (CP) meals differing in amino acid compositions on endocrine responses to meal tolerance tests (MTTs) in patients with T2D.Thirty-seven individuals with T2D [mean ± SD age: 64 ± 6 y; mean ± SD body mass index (kg/): 30.2 ± 3.6; mean ± SD glycated hemoglobin: 7.0% ± 0.6%] were randomly assigned to receive either high-animal-protein (∼80% of total protein) or high-plant-protein (∼72% of total protein) diets (30% of energy from protein, 40% of energy from carbohydrate, 30% of energy from ) for 6 wk. MTTs were performed at study onset and after 6 wk. Participants received standardized high-protein (30% of energy) meals 2 times/d containing either CP-rich (∼85% wt:wt) or PP-rich (∼95% wt:wt) foods.The CP and PP meals produced differences in insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) release. Total areas under the curve after CP were significantly lower than after the PP lunch by 40% for insulin and 23% for glucagon. Indexes of insulin sensitivity and secretion were significantly improved for the second CP MTT. This was accompanied by differential rates of appearance of amino acids. The ingestion of PP resulted in significant increases in amino acids after both meals, with a decline between meals. By contrast, CP intake resulted in increases in most amino acids after breakfast, which remained elevated but did not increase further after lunch.PP elicits greater postprandial increases in glucagon than does CP and consequently requires higher insulin to control glucose , which appears to be related to the rate of amino acid appearance. The metabolic impact of protein quality could be used as a strategy to lower insulin needs in patients with T2D.

This compound is a carboxylic polyether ionophore that exchanges monovalent ions for protons across  bilayer membranes. Monitoring the time course of viral infection showed that salinomycin blocked nuclear migration of viral nuclear protein (NP), the most abundant component of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. It caused cytoplasmic accumulation of NP, particularly within perinuclear endosomes, during virus entry. This was primarily associated with failure to acidify the endosomal-lysosomal compartments. Similar to the case with amantadine (AMT), proton channel activity of viral matrix protein 2 () was blocked by salinomycin. Using purified retroviral Gag-based virus-like particles (VLPs) with , it was proved that salinomycin directly affects the kinetics of a proton influx into the particles but in a manner different from that of AMT. Notably, oral administration of salinomycin together with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir phosphate (OSV-P) led to enhanced antiviral effect over that with either compound used alone in influenza A virus-infected mouse models. These results provide a new paradigm for developing antivirals and their combination therapy that control both host and viral factors. Influenza virus is a main cause of viral respiratory infection in humans as well as animals, occasionally with high mortality. Circulation of influenza viruses resistant to the matrix protein 2 () inhibitor, amantadine, is highly prevalent. Moreover, the frequency of detection of viruses resistant to the neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir phosphate (OSV-P) or zanamivir, is also increasing. These issues highlight the need for discovery of new antiviral agents with different mechanisms. Salinomycin as the monovalent cation-proton antiporter exhibited consistent inhibitory effects against influenza A and B viruses. It plays multifunctional roles by blocking endosomal acidification and by inactivating the proton transport function of , the key steps for influenza virus uncoating. Notably, salinomycin resulted in marked therapeutic effects in influenza virus-infected mice when combined with OSV-P, suggesting that its chemical derivatives could be developed as an adjuvant antiviral therapy to treat influenza infections resistant or less sensitive to existing drugs.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29992272>A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of nicotinamide riboside in obese men: safety, insulin-sensitivity, and -mobilizing effects.</a></h2><p>Animal studies suggest a positive role for nicotinamide riboside (NR) on insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis in models of obesity and type 2 diabetes. NR, an NAD+ precursor, is a member of the vitamin B-3 family now available as an over-the-counter supplement. Although data from preclinical trials appear consistent, potential effects and safety need to be evaluated in human clinical trials.The aim of this study was to test the safety of dietary NR supplementation over a 12-wk period and potential to improve insulin sensitivity and other metabolic parameters in obese, insulin-resistant men.In an investigator-initiated randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, and parallel-group designed clinical trial, forty healthy, sedentary men with a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/, age-range 40-70 y were randomly assigned to 12 wk of NR (1000 mg twice daily) or placebo. We determined the effects of NR supplementation on insulin sensitivity by a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and substrate  by indirect calorimetry and labeled substrates of tritiated glucose and palmitate. Body composition and  mass distribution were determined by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and MRI scans, and measurements of intrahepatic  content were obtained by MR spectroscopy.Insulin sensitivity, endogenous glucose production, and glucose disposal and oxidation were not improved by NR supplementation. Similarly, NR supplementation had no effect on resting energy expenditure, lipolysis, oxidation of lipids, or body composition. No serious adverse events due to NR supplementation were observed and safety blood tests were normal.12 wk of NR supplementation in doses of 2000 mg/d appears safe, but does not improve insulin sensitivity and whole-body glucose  in obese, insulin-resistant men.

With age, most adult patients with GSDIa develop hepatocellular adenomas (HCA), which can progress to hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). In this study, we characterized metabolic reprogramming and cellular defense alterations during tumorigenesis in the liver of hepatocyte-specific G6pc deficient (L.G6pc) mice, which develop all the hepatic hallmarks of GSDIa.Liver  and cellular defenses were assessed at pretumoral (four months) and tumoral (nine months) stages in L.G6pc mice fed a high /high sucrose (HF/HS) diet.In response to HF/HS diet, hepatocarcinogenesis was highly accelerated since 85% of L.G6pc mice developed multiple hepatic tumors after nine months, with 70% classified as HCA and 30% as HCC. Tumor development was associated with high expression of malignancy markers of HCC, i.e. alpha-fetoprotein, glypican 3 and β-catenin. In addition, L.G6pc livers exhibited loss of tumor suppressors. Interestingly, L.G6pc steatosis exhibited a low-inflammatory state and was less pronounced than in wild-type livers. This was associated with an absence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and fibrosis, while HCA/HCC showed a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the absence of TGF-β1 increase. In HCA/HCC, glycolysis was characterized by a marked expression of PK-, decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS and a decrease of pyruvate entry in the mitochondria, confirming a "Warburg-like" phenotype. These metabolic alterations led to a decrease in antioxidant defenses and autophagy and chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress in L.G6pc livers and tumors. Interestingly, autophagy was reactivated in HCA/HCC.The metabolic remodeling in L.G6pc liver generates a preneoplastic status and leads to a loss of cellular defenses and tumor suppressors that facilitates tumor development in GSDI.Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD1a) is a rare metabolic disease characterized by hypoglycemia, steatosis, excessive glycogen accumulation and tumor development in the liver. In this study, we have observed that GSDIa livers reprogram their  in a similar way to cancer cells, which facilitates tumor formation and progression, in the absence of hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, hepatic burden due to overload of glycogen and lipids in the cells leads to a decrease in cellular defenses, such as autophagy, which could further promote tumorigenesis in the case of GSDI.Copyright © 2018 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

However, the potential molecular mechanisms for TLR4-mediated macrophages activation in T2D have not yet to be fully clarified.Type 2 diabetes models in C57BL/6J mice were generated by a combination administration of streptozotocin (STZ) and a high- diet (HFD). Cell proportions of M1 and  macrophages were analyzed using flow cytometry. Expression profiles of miR-448 and TLR 4 were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot.LPS/IFN-γ significantly induced M1 polarization in macrophages characterized by the increased levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12, iNOS and decreased levels of TNF-β, CCL-22, IL-10 and Arg-1, with a higher expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in vitro. Consistently, T2D mice-derived macrophages had a significantly elevated expression of TLR4 mRNA and decreased expression of miR-448. We further confirmed that miR-448 could inhibit TLR4 expression by targeting the 3'-UTR of TLR4, rescuing the LPS/IFN-γ-induced M1 macrophage polarization.Taken together, our results indicated that decreased miR-448 in diabetic macrophages may contribute to LPS-induced M1 polarization by targeting TLR4, thereby modulating T2D development.© 2018 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29547398>Lysosomal acid lipase and : new mechanisms, new questions, and new therapies.</a></h2><p>Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), encoded by the LIPA gene, is an essential lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes cholesteryl ester and triglyceride delivered to the lysosome.

However, hepatic microenvironments that support the function of RORα as a polarity regulator were largely unknown. Here, we identified maresin 1 (MaR1), a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) metabolite with a function of specialized proresolving mediator, as an endogenous ligand of RORα. MaR1 enhanced the expression and transcriptional activity of RORα and thereby increased the  polarity of liver macrophages. Administration of MaR1 protected mice from high- diet-induced NASH in a RORα-dependent manner. Surprisingly, RORα increased the level of MaR1 through transcriptional induction of 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), a key enzyme in MaR1 biosynthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that modulation of 12-LOX activity enhanced the protective function of DHA against NASH. Together, these results suggest that the MaR1/RORα/12-LOX autoregulatory circuit could offer potential therapeutic strategies for curing NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744038> Alleviates Insulin Resistance in Diet-Induced Obese Mice by Modulating Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance is strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome, and chronic inflammation is known to be a major mechanism of insulin resistance and is a therapeutic target. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of  (SB) in high- diet (HFD)-induced insulin-resistant mice and to investigate its mechanism based on inflammatory responses. Mice were fed a HFD to induce insulin resistance and then administered SB for nine weeks. Body weight, glucose, , insulin, epididymal  pad and liver weights, and histologic characteristics were evaluated to determine the effect on insulin resistance. In order to evaluate the effects on the inflammatory process, we analyzed the proportions of macrophages in liver and epididymal  and measured inflammatory gene expression. Fasting and postprandial glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly decreased by SB administration. The epididymal  and liver showed significant weight decreases and histological improvements.

We retrospectively studied the potential interactions between iron and AT during an experimental overfeeding in participants without obesity.Twenty-six participants (mean body mass index ± SD, 24.7 ± 3.1 kg/) underwent a 56-day overfeeding (+760 kcal/d). Serum iron biomarkers (ELISA), subcutaneous AT (SAT) gene expression, and abdominal AT distribution assessed by MRI were analyzed at the beginning and the end of the intervention.Before intervention: SAT mRNA expression of the iron transporter transferrin (Tf) was positively correlated with the expression of genes related to lipogenesis (lipin 1, ACSL1) and  storage (SCD). SAT expression of the ferritin light chain (FTL) gene, encoding ferritin (FT), an intracellular iron storage protein, was negatively correlated to SREBF1, a gene related to lipogenesis. Serum FT (mean, 92 ± 57 ng/mL) was negatively correlated with the expression of SAT genes linked to  storage (SCD, DGAT2) and to lipogenesis (SREBF1, ACSL1). After intervention: Overfeeding led to a 2.3 ± 1.3-kg weight gain. In parallel to increased expression of  storage-related genes (mitoNEET, SCD, DGAT2, SREBF1), SAT Tf, SLC40A1 (encoding ferroportin 1, a membrane iron export channel) and hephaestin mRNA levels increased, whereas SAT FTL mRNA decreased, suggesting increased AT iron requirement. Serum FT decreased to 67 ± 43 ng/mL. However, no significant associations between serum iron biomarkers and AT distribution or expansion were observed.In healthy men, iron  gene expression in SAT is associated with  storage and lipogenesis genes expression and is modulated during a 56-day overfeeding diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30484514>Is it Possible to Easily Identify Metabolically Healthy Obese Women?</a></h2><p>Obesity is recognized as a major risk factor for the development of several metabolic complications.

This study was designed to compare the effects of an isocaloric exchange of simple, refined, and unrefined carbohydrates on serum cardiometabolic risk indicators, adipose tissue inflammatory markers, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fractional cholesterol efflux.Participants [postmenopausal women and men (N = 11), 65 ± 8 years, body mass index 29.8 ± 3.2 kg/, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ≥2.6 mmol/L] were provided with diets (60% energy from total carbohydrate, 15% from protein, 25% from ) for 4.5 weeks in a randomized crossover design, with 2-week washout periods. The variable component was an isocaloric exchange of simple, refined, or unrefined carbohydrate-containing foods. Serum lipoprotein, glucose, insulin, and inflammatory marker concentrations were measured. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was aspirated to assess macrophage and inflammatory marker gene expression and ex vivo cytokine secretion, and PBMCs were isolated to assess ex vivo fractional cholesterol efflux.Fasting serum LDL and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations were higher after the refined compared with simple or unrefined carbohydrate-enriched diets (P < 0.01). Other serum measures, ex vivo fractional cholesterol efflux and adipose tissue gene expression and ex vivo cytokine secretion, were similar between diets.Diets enriched in refined compared with simple or unrefined carbohydrate resulted in higher fasting serum LDL and non-HDL cholesterol concentrations but had little effect on other cardiometabolic risk indicators.

Participants ingested daily 25 mg (-)-epicatechin (encapsulated) or placebo for 2-wk in random order (2-wk washout). After an overnight fast, blood pressure was monitored and blood samples were collected before and after both treatments. Anthropometric data were determined at each visit. Dietary intake was assessed by 3-d food records during both treatments and during run-in and washout phase.Supplementation of pure (-)-epicatechin did not significantly affect blood pressure, glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, triglycerides, or total, LDL, or HDL cholesterol. Oxidized LDL, vitamins C and E, and β-carotene in plasma were not modulated. Body weight,  mass,  distribution, and the intake of energy, nutrients, and (-)-epicatechin from food remained stable throughout the study.Daily intake of 25 mg of pure (-)-epicatechin for 2 wk does not reduce cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight-to-obese adults.

Previous studies revealed that the benzenesulfonamide scaffold displays efficient 5-LO-inhibitory properties. Here, we structurally optimized benzenesulfonamides which led to an N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide derivative (compound 47) with potent inhibitory activities (IC = 2.3 and 0.4 μM for isolated 5-LO and 5-LO in intact cells, respectively). Compound 47 prevented the interaction of 5-LO with its activating protein (FLAP) at the nuclear envelope in transfected HEK293 cells as shown by in situ proximity ligation assay. Comprehensive assessment of the LM profile produced by human macrophages revealed the ability of 47 to selectively down-regulate pro-inflammatory LMs (i.e. LTs and PGE) in M1 but to enhance the formation of pro-resolving LMs (i.e. resolvins and maresins) in  macrophages.

The liposomes were modified with a hairpin-structured, activatable cell-penetrating peptide that is specifically responsive to the tumor-associated protease legumain.It was revealed simvastatin can disrupt  rafts (cholesterol-rich domains) and suppress integrin-β3 and focal adhesion formation, thus inhibiting FAK signaling pathway and re-sensitizing the drug-resistant cancer cells to paclitaxel. Furthermore, simvastatin was able to re-polarize tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), promoting -to-M1 phenotype switch via cholesterol-associated LXR/ABCA1 regulation.

The present study examined the effects of continuous training (CT) and aerobic-interval training (AIT) coinciding with a high- diet (HFD) on capillary density, macrophage polarization in mesenteric (mAT) and subcutaneous (sAT) adipose tissue.48 male Wistar rats were divided into HFD and normal diet (ND) groups. After 10 weeks, each group was divided into sedentary, CT, and AIT. The animals in training groups performed 10-week matched distances of CT and AIT on a motorized treadmill (5 times/week).The results showed that HFD significantly reduced the capillary density of adipose tissue (sAT: 54% vs. mAT:49%) and increased systemic insulin resistance, mean adipocyte size, crown-like structure (CLs), and M1-macrophages with no change in the total number of adipocytes in either tissue. Exercise training reversed the HFD induced adipose tissue dysfunction. Compared to CT, AIT was more effective on increasing the capillary density of sAT (170 vs. 87%) and mAT (140 vs. 100%). Likewise, AIT increased the capillary density of both tissues even in comparison to the ND sedentary group (~25%). Compared with CT as well, AIT more significantly increased the number of  macrophages (181 vs. 122%) and decreased CLs (60 vs. 38%) in mAT.The findings suggest that hypertrophy is a major contributor to adipose tissue expansion in obesity. Furthermore, exercise training largely demonstrated beneficial effects on adipose tissue remodeling, where AIT is more effective than CT in reducing HFD-induced adipose tissue dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

There are indications that glucose  and insulin sensitivity, which are generally disturbed in overweight and obese individuals, may improve by increased dairy intake. This may also affect one's  flexibility.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of high compared with low dairy intake on glucose , insulin sensitivity, and  flexibility in overweight adults (aged 45-65 y).In this randomized intervention study, subjects consumed a high- and a low-dairy diet [HDD (5-6 dairy portions) and LDD (≤1 dairy portion), respectively] for 6 wk in a crossover design, with a washout period of 4 wk. Dairy portions were 200 g semi-skimmed yoghurt, 30 g reduced-fat (30+) cheese, and 250 mL semiskimmed milk and buttermilk. After 6 wk, a 75-g oral-glucose-tolerance test (13C-labeled) and a subsequent fasting challenge were performed.  flexibility was studied by determining the respiratory quotient (RQ) using indirect calorimetry. Fasting and postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin were analyzed. The dual isotope technique enabled calculation of glucose kinetics.The study was completed by 45 overweight men and postmenopausal women [age 58.9 ± 4.3 y, BMI 27.9 ± 1.9 kg/ (mean ± SD)]. Fasting RQ and ΔRQ, reflecting  flexibility, did not differ after both diets. Fasting glucose concentrations were similar, whereas fasting insulin concentrations were lower after the LDD (LDD: 8.1 ± 2.8 mU/L; HDD: 8.9 ± 3.3 mU/L; P = 0.024). This resulted in a higher HOMA-IR after the HDD (P = 0.027). Postprandial glucose and insulin responses as well as glucose kinetics were similar after both diets.The amount of dairy intake during a 6-wk period had a neutral effect on  flexibility or postprandial glucose  in middle-aged overweight subjects. More trials are needed to study the effects of specific dairy types and to differentiate between  subgroups.

Here we show that exosomes secreted by PDAC cell lines differed in their surface proteins,  composition, and efficiency of fusing with THP-1-derived macrophages in vitro. Exosomes from AsPC-1, an ascites-derived human PDAC cell line, were enriched in ICAM-1, which mediated their docking to macrophages through interactions with surface-exposed CD11c on macrophages. AsPC-1 exosomes also contained much higher levels of arachidonic acid (AA), and they fused at a higher rate with THP-1-derived macrophages than did exosomes from other PDAC cell lines or from an immortalized normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line (HPDE) H6c7. Phospholipase A2 enzymatic cleavage of arachidonic acid from AsPC-1 exosomes reduced fusion efficiency. PGE2 secretion was elevated in macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes but not in macrophages treated with exosomes from other cell lines, suggesting a functional role for the AsPC-1 exosome-delivered arachidonic acid in macrophages. Non-polarized (M0) macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes had increased levels of surface markers indicative of polarization to an immunosuppressive -like phenotype (CD14hi CD163hi CD206hi). Furthermore, macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes had significantly increased secretion of pro-tumoral, bioactive molecules including VEGF, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-1β, MMP-9, and TNFα. Together, these results demonstrate that compared to exosomes from other primary tumor-derived PDAC cell lines, AsPC-1 exosomes alter THP-1-derived macrophage phenotype and function. AsPC-1 exosomes mediate communication between tumor cells and TAMs that contributes to tumor progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028699>Methodologic considerations for measuring energy expenditure differences between diets varying in carbohydrate using the doubly labeled water method.</a></h2><p>Low-carbohydrate diets have been reported to significantly increase human energy expenditure when measured using doubly labeled water (DLW) but not by respiratory chambers. Although DLW may reveal true physiological differences undetected by respiratory chambers, an alternative possibility is that the expenditure differences resulted from failure to correctly estimate the respiratory quotient (RQ) used in the DLW calculations.To examine energy expenditure differences between isocaloric diets varying widely in carbohydrate and to quantitatively compare DLW data with respiratory chamber and body composition measurements within an energy balance framework.DLW measurements were obtained during the final 2 wk of month-long baseline (BD; 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, 15% protein) and isocaloric ketogenic diets (KD; 5% carbohydrate, 80% fat, 15% protein) in 17 men with a BMI of 25-35 kg/. Subjects resided 2 d/wk in respiratory chambers to measure energy expenditure (EEchamber). DLW expenditure was calculated using chamber-determined RQ either unadjusted (EEDLW) or adjusted (EEDLWΔRQ) for net energy imbalance using diet-specific coefficients. Accelerometers measured physical activity. Body composition changes were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) which were combined with energy intake measurements to calculate energy expenditure by balance (EEbal).After transitioning from BD to KD, neither EEchamber nor EEbal were significantly changed (∆EEchamber = 24 ± 30 kcal/d; P = 0.43 and ∆EEbal = -141 ± 118 kcal/d; P = 0.25). Similarly, physical activity (-5.1 ± 4.8%; P = 0.3) and exercise efficiency (-1.6 ± 2.4%; P = 0.52) were not significantly changed. However, EEDLW was 209 ± 83 kcal/d higher during the KD (P = 0.023) but was not significantly increased when adjusted for energy balance (EEDLWΔRQ = 139 ± 89 kcal/d; P = 0.14). After removing 2 outliers whose EEDLW were incompatible with other data, EEDLW was marginally increased during the KD by 126 ± 62 kcal/d (P = 0.063) and EEDLW∆RQ was only 46 ± 65 kcal/d higher (P = 0.49).DLW calculations failing to account for diet-specific energy imbalance effects on RQ erroneously suggest that low-carbohydrate diets substantially increase energy expenditure.

Dose-limiting events were edema (n = 11), hyperglycemia (n = 6), and nausea (n = 2). After dose reduction to a level free of clinical side effects, DZX treatment was associated with a markedly greater decrease in fasting insulin levels than PL (-72.3 ± 3.5% vs -23.0 ± 12.6%; P < 0.001) and a significant improvement of blood pressure and plasma  levels. The decline in insulin levels occurred at the cost of a small increase in plasma glucose (0.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L vs -0.1 ± 0.1 mmol/L; P = 0.04) and hemoglobin A1C (0.2 ± 0.1% vs 0.0 ± 0.1%; P = 0.17).In nondiabetic obese men, insulin levels can be reduced up to 70% without major metabolic side effects.

The purpose of this study was to fabricate phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing supported  bilayers (SLBs) on a titanium surface to regulate the polarization of macrophages, a critical factor that affects following tissue healing and regeneration. The fluorescent recovery after photobleaching images showed that the percentage of PS had a critical influence on the fluidity, and 20% PS had the highest fluidity. Furthermore, more expanded and elongated cells were observed in the SLB-coated groups. transforming growth factor-β1 and vascular endothelial growth factor, the key cytokine markers of  macrophage polarization, were increased in the SLB-coated groups, especially in the 20% PS group. Consistently, cells cultured on the SLB-coated titanium exhibited the distribution of CD206 , which is a  macrophage specific maker. The results of this study demonstrated  polarization of macrophages on PS-SLB-coated titanium discs, which suggests the application of PS-SLB as an immune-regulating coating material to improve tissue reactions to dental implants.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Recent studies have suggested that altered AT oxygen tension (pO2) may contribute to AT dysfunction. Here, we compared in vivo abdominal (ABD) and femoral (FEM) subcutaneous AT pO2 in women who are overweight and have obesity, and investigated the effects of physiological AT pO2 on human adipocyte function.ABD and FEM subcutaneous AT pO2 and AT blood flow (ATBF) were assessed in eight [BMI (body mass index) 34.4 ± 1.6 kg/] postmenopausal women who were overweight with obesity and impaired glucose . ABD and FEM AT biopsy specimens were collected to determine adipocyte morphology and AT gene expression. Moreover, the effects of prolonged exposure (14 days) to physiological AT pO2 on adipokine expression/secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and glucose uptake were investigated in differentiated human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells.AT pO2 was higher in ABD than FEM AT (62.7 ± 6.6 vs 50.0 ± 4.5 mm Hg, P = 0.013), whereas ATBF was comparable between depots. Maximal uncoupled oxygen consumption rates were substantially lower in ABD than FEM adipocytes for all pO2 conditions. Low physiological pO2 (5% O2) decreased proinflammatory gene expression, increased basal glucose uptake, and altered adipokine secretion in ABD and FEM adipocytes.We demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, that AT pO2 is higher in ABD than FEM subcutaneous AT in women who are overweight/with obesity, partly due to a lower oxygen consumption rate in ABD adipocytes. Moreover, low physiological pO2 decreased proinflammatory gene expression and improved the metabolic phenotype in differentiated human adipocytes, whereas more heterogeneous effects on adipokine secretion were found.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153260>Influence of puberty timing on adiposity and cardiometabolic traits: A Mendelian randomisation study.</a></h2><p>Earlier puberty is widely linked with future obesity and cardiometabolic disease. We examined whether age at puberty onset likely influences adiposity and cardiometabolic traits independent of childhood adiposity.One-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses were conducted on up to 3,611 white-European female and male offspring from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort recruited at birth via mothers between 1 April 1991 and 31 December 1992. Time-sensitive exposures were age at menarche and age at voice breaking. Outcomes measured at age 18 y were body mass index (BMI), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-based  and lean mass indices, blood pressure, and 230 cardiometabolic traits derived from targeted metabolomics (150 concentrations plus 80 ratios from nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] spectroscopy covering lipoprotein subclasses of cholesterol and triglycerides, amino acids, inflammatory glycoproteins, and others). Adjustment was made for pre-pubertal BMI measured at age 8 y. For negative control MR analyses, BMI and cardiometabolic trait measures taken at age 8 y (before puberty, and which therefore cannot be an outcome of puberty itself) were used. For replication analyses, 2-sample MR was conducted using summary genome-wide association study data on up to 322,154 adults for post-pubertal BMI, 24,925 adults for post-pubertal NMR cardiometabolic traits, and 13,848 children for pre-pubertal obesity (negative control). Like observational estimates, 1-sample MR estimates in ALSPAC using 351 polymorphisms for age at menarche (explaining 10.6% of variance) among 2,053 females suggested that later age at menarche (per year) was associated with -1.38 kg/ of BMI at age 18 y (or -0.34 SD units, 95% CI -0.46, -0.23; P = 9.77 × 10-09). This coefficient attenuated 10-fold upon adjustment for BMI at age 8 y, to -0.12 kg/ (or -0.03 SDs, 95% CI -0.13, 0.07; P = 0.55). Associations with blood pressure were similar, but associations across other traits were small and inconsistent. In negative control MR analyses, later age at menarche was associated with -0.77 kg/ of pre-pubertal BMI measured at age 8 y (or -0.39 SDs, 95% CI -0.50, -0.29; P = 6.28 × 10-13), indicating that variants influencing menarche also influence BMI before menarche. Cardiometabolic trait associations were weaker and less consistent among males and both sexes combined. Higher BMI at age 8 y (per 1 kg/ using 95 polymorphisms for BMI explaining 3.4% of variance) was associated with earlier menarche among 2,648 females (by -0.26 y, 95% CI -0.37, -0.16; P = 1.16 × 10-06), likewise among males and both sexes combined. In 2-sample MR analyses using 234 polymorphisms and inverse variance weighted (IVW) regression, each year later age at menarche was associated with -0.81 kg/ of adult BMI (or -0.17 SD units, 95% CI -0.21, -0.12; P = 4.00 × 10-15). Associations were weaker with cardiometabolic traits. Using 202 polymorphisms, later menarche was associated with lower odds of childhood obesity (IVW-based odds ratio = 0.52 per year later, 95% CI 0.48, 0.57; P = 6.64 × 10-15). Study limitations include modest sample sizes for 1-sample MR, lack of inference to non-white-European populations, potential selection bias through modest completion rates of puberty questionnaires, and likely disproportionate measurement error of exposures by sex. The cardiometabolic traits examined were heavily -focused and did not include hormone-related traits such as insulin and insulin-like growth factors.Our results suggest that puberty timing has a small influence on adiposity and cardiometabolic traits and that preventive interventions should instead focus on reducing childhood adiposity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846007>Prevalence and relationship of hypertriglyceridaemic-waist phenotype and type 2 diabetes mellitus among a rural adult Chinese population.</a></h2><p>Limited information is available on the prevalence and effect of hypertriglyceridaemic-waist (HTGW) phenotype on the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in rural populations.In the present cross-sectional study, we investigated the prevalence of the HTGW phenotype and T2DM and the strength of their association among rural adults in China.HTGW was defined as TAG &gt;1·7 mmol/l and waist circumference (WC) ≥90 cm for males and ≥80 cm for females.

Depletion of the ubiquitin ligase Siah2 reduced white adipose tissue inflammation and improved glucose  in obese male mice. Siah2 is a transcriptional target of estrogen, but data is lacking about the effect of Siah2 on adipose tissue of females. We therefore evaluated the impact of Siah2 deficiency on white and brown adipose tissue in females of reproductive age.Body composition, adipose tissue morphology, brown adipose tissue gene, and protein expression and adipocyte sizing were evaluated in wild-type and Siah2KO female and male mice fed a low-fat or high-fat diet. Glucose and insulin tolerance, fasting glucose, insulin, fatty acids and triglycerides, and gene expression of inflammation markers in perigonadal fat were evaluated in wild-type and Siah2KO female mice. Microarray analysis of brown fat gene expression was carried out in both sexes. Statistical analysis was assessed by unpaired two-tailed t test and repeated measures ANOVA.Siah2 deficiency improves glucose and insulin tolerance in the presence of hypertrophied white adipocytes in high-fat-fed female mice with percent fat comparable to male mice. While previous studies showed Siah2KO reduces the white adipose tissue inflammatory response in male mice, the response in females is biased toward the upregulation of -like markers in white adipose tissue. In contrast, loss of Siah2 leads to increased whitening of brown fat in males, but not in females. This corresponded to increased expression of markers of inflammation (F4/80, Ccl2) and thermogenic genes (Pgc1alpha, Dio2, Ucp-1) and proteins (PGC-1α, UCP-1) in females. Contrary to expectations, increased expression of thermogenic markers in females was coupled with a downregulation of ERalpha and ERRgamma protein levels.The most striking sex-related effect of Siah2 deficiency is reduced whitening of brown fat in high-fat-fed females. Protection from accumulating unilocular adipocytes in the brown fat corresponds to increased expression of thermogenic genes and proteins in female, but not in male mice. These results raise the possibility that Siah2 contributes to the estrogen-related effects on brown fat function in males and females.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30411703>Screening for hepatic fibrosis and steatosis in Turkish patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A transient elastography study.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

The prevalence rates of overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome in our sample were 28.2%, 64.5%, and 77.4%, respectively. Probe-specific LSM cut-off values were used to define advanced fibrosis (>F3) and cirrhosis (F4) (M probe: F3=9.6-11.4 kPa, F4 >11.5 kPa and XL probe: F3=9.3-10.9 kPa, F4 >11.0 kPa). Mild, moderate, and severe steatosis were defined as CAP 222-232 dB/m, CAP 233-289 dB/m, and CAP >290 dB/m, respectively.Advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were identified in 21 (16.9%) and 10 (8.0%) patients, respectively. TE-defined hepatic steatosis (CAP>222 dB/m) was detected in 117 (94.3%) patients. Mild, moderate, and severe steatosis were identified in 0, 29, and 88 patients, respectively.TE is a useful non-invasive imaging modality to screen for liver involvement in Turkish patients with T2DM.

Mice with Treg cell-restricted Neuropilin-1 deficiency show tumor resistance while maintaining peripheral immune homeostasis, thereby providing a controlled system to interrogate the impact of intratumoral Treg cells on the TME. Using this and other genetic models, we showed that Treg cells shaped the transcriptional landscape across multiple tumor-infiltrating immune cell types. Treg cells suppressed CD8 T cell secretion of interferon-γ (IFNγ), which would otherwise block the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-mediated fatty acid synthesis in immunosuppressive (-like) tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Thus, Treg cells indirectly but selectively sustained -like TAM metabolic fitness, mitochondrial integrity, and survival.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusions have recently been suggested to alleviate myocardial injury and ameliorate cardiac function. However, few studies have focused on the effects of MSCs in DCM. Therefore, we explored the effects of MSC-regulated macrophage polarization on myocardial repair in DCM.A DCM rat model was induced by a high- diet and streptozotocin (STZ) administration and infused 4 times with MSCs. Rat blood and heart tissue were analyzed for blood glucose levels,  levels, echocardiography, histopathology, macrophage phenotype ratios and inflammatory cytokines, respectively. We mimicked chronic inflammation in vitro by inducing peritoneal macrophages with high glucose and LPS, then cocultured these macrophages with MSCs to explore the specific mechanism of MSCs on macrophage polarization.DCM rats exhibited abnormal blood glucose levels and , cardiac inflammation and dysfunction. MSC infusion ameliorated metabolic abnormalities and preserved cardiac structure and function in DCM rats. Moreover, MSC infusion significantly increased the  phenotype macrophages and alleviated cardiac inflammation. Interestingly, this in vitro study revealed that the MSCs pretreated with a COX-2 inhibitor had little effect on  macrophage polarization, but this phenomenon could be reversed by adding prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).Our results suggested that MSC infusions can protect against cardiac injury in DCM rats.

The PPAR-γ Pro12Ala polymorphism was determined by a molecular genetic study. "Statistica 6.0" was used. The frequency of Ala-allele carriers is 0.28. We studied that GWG is 1.6 times higher in women with PPAR-γ Pro12Ala polymorphism, than the Pro/Pro genotype (p<0.05). The frequency of Ala-alleles carriers in a group of excessive GWG 2.6 times (OR 3.2; 95% Cl 1.1-9.3; p<0.05) higher compared to normal weight gain patients. In pregnant women with Ala12 polymorphism concentration of triglycerides (p<0.05), cholesterol (p<0.05) are increased and no differences in glucose level (p>0.05), insulin level (p>0.05), and HOMO-IR index (p>0.05) compared to women with Pro/Pro genotype. The insulin concentration in PPAR-γ Ala12 carriers at the end of pregnancy was 1.4 times higher than the early terms (p<0.01) on the background of normoglycemia and the normal HOMO-IR index. The modified transcriptional activity of PPAR-γ gene, associated with  and carbohydrate , has a direct effect on the weight gain during pregnancy.

Due to this phenotypic transition of macrophages, the inflammatory response was alleviated, and  was enhanced in AS plaques. This effect was achieved by promoting the expression of reverse transporters (ATP-binding cassette transporter member 1 and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 1) and inhibiting the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB-mediated phosphorylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30747271>Reduced meal frequency alleviates high- diet-induced  accumulation and inflammation in adipose tissue of pigs under the circumstance of fixed feed allowance.</a></h2><p>The present study was conducted to determine whether reduced meal frequency (MF) could restore high- diet (HFD)-modified phenotypes and microbiota under the condition of fixed feed allowance.A total of 32 barrows with initial weight of 61.6 ± 0.8 kg were assigned to two diets [control diet (CON) versus HFD] and two meal frequencies [12 equal meals/day (M12) versus 2 equal meals/day ()], the trial lasted 8 weeks. The  and inflammatory response in adipose tissue as well as the profiles of intestinal microbiota and bacterial-derived metabolites were determined. versus M12 feeding regimen decreased perirenal  weight and serum triglyceride and liposaccharide (LPS) concentrations in HFD-fed pigs (P < 0.05). Reduced MF down-regulated mRNA expression of lipoprotein lipase, CD36 molecule, interleukin 1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, toll-like receptor 4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88), and nuclear factor kappa beta 1 as well as protein expression of MYD88 in perirenal  of HFD-fed pigs (P < 0.05).  feeding regimen increased abundance of Prevotella and decreased abundance of Bacteroides in colonic content of HFD-fed pigs (P < 0.05). No difference in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) profile in colonic content was observed among four groups (P > 0.05).Our results suggested that  versus M12 feeding regimen ameliorated HFD-induced  deposition and inflammatory response by decreasing fatty acid uptake and deactivating LPS/TLR4 signaling pathway in adipose tissue and restoring microbiota composition in distal intestine, without affecting SCFAs profile in distal luminal content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29750646>Circulating steroid levels as correlates of adipose tissue phenotype in premenopausal women.</a></h2><p>Background Obesity-related alterations in the circulating steroid hormone profile remain equivocal in women. Our objective was to identify circulating steroid levels that relate to increased adiposity and altered adipose phenotype in premenopausal women. Materials and methods In a sample of 42 premenopausal women [age 46 ± 3 years; body mass index (BMI) 27.1 ± 4.2 kg/], 19 plasma steroids were quantified by electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (ESI-LC-MS/MS). Body composition and  distribution were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT), respectively. Markers of adipose tissue function including adipocyte size distributions, radiological attenuation and macrophage infiltration were also analyzed in surgically obtained visceral and subcutaneous  samples. Results Many negative correlations were observed between adiposity measurements such as BMI, body  percentage or total abdominal adipose tissue area and plasma levels of androstenedione (Δ4) (r = -0.33 to -0.39, p ≤ 0.04), androsterone (ADT) (r = -0.30 to -0.38, p ≤ 0.05) and steroid precursor pregnenolone (PREG) (r = -0.36 to -0.46, p ≤ 0.02). Visceral adipocyte hypertrophy was observed in patients with low PREG concentrations (p < 0.05). Visceral adipose tissue radiologic attenuation, a potential marker of adipocyte size, was also positively correlated with PREG levels (r = 0.33, p < 0.05). Low levels of PREG were related to increased number of macrophages infiltrating visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (p < 0.05). Conclusion Plasma levels of androgens and their precursors are lower in women with increased adiposity and visceral adipocyte hypertrophy. Low circulating PREG concentration may represent a marker of adipose tissue dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29759104>Delayed postprandial TAG peak after intake of SFA compared with PUFA in subjects with and without familial hypercholesterolaemia: a randomised controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Postprandial hypertriacylglycerolaemia is associated with an increased risk of developing CVD. How  quality influences postprandial  response is scarcely explored in subjects with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). The aim of this study was to investigate the postprandial response of TAG and  sub-classes after consumption of high- meals with different  quality in subjects with FH compared with normolipidaemic controls. A randomised controlled double-blind cross-over study with two meals and two groups was performed. A total of thirteen hypercholesterolaemic subjects with FH who discontinued -lowering treatment 4 weeks before and during the study, and fourteen normolipidaemic controls, were included. Subjects were aged 18-30 years and had a BMI of 18·5-30·0 kg/. Each meal consisted of a muffin containing 60 g (70 E%) of , either mainly SFA (40 E%) or PUFA (40 E%), eaten in a random order with a wash-out period of 3-5 weeks between the meals. Blood samples were collected at baseline (fasting) and 2, 4 and 6 h after intake of the meals. In both FH and control subjects, the level of TAG and the largest VLDL sub-classes peaked at 2 h after intake of PUFA and at 4 h after intake of SFA. No significant differences were found in TAG levels between meals or between groups (0·25≤P≤0·72). The distinct TAG peaks may reflect differences in the postprandial  after intake of fatty acids with different chain lengths and degrees of saturation. The clinical impact of these findings remains to be determined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31019294>Pirfenidone prevents and reverses hepatic insulin resistance and steatohepatitis by polarizing  macrophages.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with lipotoxic liver injury, leading to insulin resistance, inflammation, and fibrosis. Despite its increased global incidence, very few promising treatments for NASH are available. Pirfenidone is an antifibrotic agent used to treat pulmonary fibrosis; it suppresses the pulmonary influx of T cells and macrophages. Here, we investigated the effect of pirfenidone in a mouse model of lipotoxicity-induced NASH via a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet. After 12 weeks of feeding, pirfenidone administration attenuated excessive hepatic lipid accumulation and peroxidation by reducing the expression of genes related to lipogenesis and fatty acid synthesis and enhancing the expression of those related to fatty acid oxidation. Flow cytometry indicated that pirfenidone reduced the number of total hepatic macrophages, particularly CD11cCD206(M1)-type macrophages, increased the number of CD11cCD206()-type macrophages, and subsequently reduced T-cell numbers, which helped improve insulin resistance and steatohepatitis. Moreover, pirfenidone downregulated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mRNA expression of M1 marker genes and upregulated IL-4-induced  marker genes in a dose-dependent manner in RAW264.7 macrophages. Importantly, pirfenidone reversed insulin resistance, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in mice with pre-existing NASH. These findings suggest that pirfenidone is a potential candidate for the treatment of NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30667374>Adipocyte-secreted exosomal microRNA-34a inhibits  macrophage polarization to promote obesity-induced adipose inflammation.</a></h2><p>Persistent, unresolved inflammation in adipose tissue is a major contributor to obesity-associated metabolic complications. However, the molecular links between -overloaded adipocytes and inflammatory immune cells in obese adipose tissues remain elusive. Here we identified adipocyte-secreted microRNA-34a (miR-34a) as a key mediator through its paracrine actions on adipose-resident macrophages. The expression of miR-34a in adipose tissues was progressively increased with the development of dietary obesity. Adipose-selective or adipocyte-specific miR-34a-KO mice were resistant to obesity-induced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation, and this was accompanied by a significant shift in polarization of adipose-resident macrophages from proinflammatory M1 to antiinflammatory  phenotype. Mechanistically, mature adipocyte-secreted exosomes transported miR-34a into macrophages, thereby suppressing  polarization by repressing the expression of Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4). The suppressive effects of miR-34a on  polarization and its stimulation of inflammatory responses were reversed by ectopic expression of Klf4 in both bone marrow-derived macrophages and adipose depots of obese mice. Furthermore, increased miR-34a expression in visceral  of overweight/obese subjects correlated negatively with reduced Klf4 expression, but positively with the parameters of insulin resistance and metabolic inflammation. In summary, miR-34a was a key component of adipocyte-secreted exosomal vesicles that transmitted the signal of nutrient overload to the adipose-resident macrophages for exacerbation of obesity-induced systemic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29871859>TACI-Deficient Macrophages Protect Mice Against Metaflammation and Obesity-Induced Dysregulation of Glucose Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) is a receptor for the TNF superfamily cytokines, B cell-activating factor (BAFF), and A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). Here, we demonstrate that TACI-deficient mice subjected to high- diet (HFD) are protected from weight gain and dysregulated glucose homeostasis. Resistance to HFD-induced metabolic changes in TACI-deficient mice does not involve TACI-mediated adipogenesis. Instead, accumulation of  macrophages (Mϕs), eosinophils, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is implicated in the protection from obesity-induced assaults. In support of this hypothesis, adoptively transferred TACI-deficient peritoneal or adipose tissue Mϕs, but not B cells, can improve glucose  in the obese host. Interestingly, the transferred TACI-deficient Mϕs not only home to host VAT but also trigger the accumulation of host  Mϕs and eosinophils in VAT. The increase in host  Mϕs in VAT is likely a result of eosinophil recruitment in response to eotaxin-2 produced by TACI-deficient Mϕs. Insulin signaling experiments revealed that IL-10 secreted by TACI-deficient Mϕs is responsible for maintaining adipocyte insulin sensitivity. Thus, the adoptive transfer experiments offer a model where TACI-deficient Mϕs accumulate in VAT and protect against metaflammation and obesity-associated dysregulation of glucose .© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30838686>Possible anti-obesity effects of phytosterols and phytostanols supplementation in humans: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h2><p>Present meta-analysis investigates the effects of phytosterols and phytostanol (PS) supplementation on anthropometric indices, using data from randomized controlled trials. We performed a systematic search in the databases: PubMed, Scopus, Cochran, and Web of Science. Weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were presented. Overall, 79 randomized controlled trials investigated the effects of PS on anthropometric indices. Meta-analysis results did not reveal any significant effect of PS supplementation on weight (66 trials-WMD: -0.083 kg; CI [-0.233, 0.066]; I  = 42.5%), percentage  mass (6 trials-WMD: -0.090%; CI [-0.789, 0.610]; I  = 0.0%), and waist circumference (WC; 5 trials-WMD: -0.039 cm; CI [-0.452, 0.374]; I  = 0.0%). However, body mass index (BMI) significantly decreased after PS supplementation (39 trials-WMD: -0.063 kg/, p = 0.024, I  = 25.1%). Subgroup analyses showed that PS supplementation in subjects with baseline BMI ≥25 and hyperlipidemic significantly decreased body weight and BMI. The overall results showed that although PS supplementation did not affect anthropometric indices (except BMI), baseline status regarding BMI and hyperlipidemia and also dose and duration could be contributing factors for favorable effects.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30396756>Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate alleviates liver injury in obese rats with acute necrotizing pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>For patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP), a high body mass index (BMI) increases the likelihood of acute hepatic injury (AHI). In the current study, we explored whether magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIg) could alleviate ANP-induced liver injury in obese rats.Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were selected for the present study, and the ANP model was established by retrograde injection of 5% sodium taurocholate into the biliary-pancreatic duct. Thirty-six SD rats were randomly assigned to six groups: the normal (N), standard rat chow (SRC) normal (SN), SRC ANP (S-ANP), high- diet (HFD) normal (H-N), HFD ANP (H-ANP), and MgIg pretreatment HFD ANP (H-ANPT) groups. The rats in the H-ANPT group were treated with MgIg (30 mg/kg) intragastrically for 7 days before the ANP model was established. The rats were sacrificed 12 h after ANP was established, and the blood and pancreatic and liver tissues were collected. Differences in the physiology, pathology and cellular and molecular responses of the rats in each group were examined.Analyses of serum amylase lipase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase indicated that obesity aggravated ANP-induced hepatic injury and that MgIg improved liver function. The superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, M1 macrophage,  macrophage, neutrophil, NF-κB, IL-1β and caspase-3 levels in liver tissue showed that MgIg attenuated H-ANP-induced hepatic injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation.Obesity aggravated ANP-induced liver injury via oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions. MgIg alleviated oxidative stress and decreased the inflammatory reaction, protecting the liver against the AHI induced by ANP in obese rats.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

Insulin resistance was assessed via the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (primary endpoint) and confirmed by [6-6-2H2]-glucose-labeled, 2-step hyperinsulinemic clamp (n = 20). Clinically relevant cardiometabolic endpoints [including flow-mediated dilatation, augmentation index, lipoprotein status (by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), and nitric oxide (NO)-related metabolite assay] and anthocyanin  were assessed.A daily intake of 1 cup of blueberries improved endothelial function (flow-mediated dilatation: +1.45%; 95% CI: 0.83%, 2.1%; P = 0.003), systemic arterial stiffness (augmentation index: -2.24%; 95% CI: -3.97%, -0.61%; P = 0.04) and attenuated cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentrations. In statin nonusers (n = 71), elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+0.08 mmol/L; P = 0.03), high-density lipoprotein particle density (+0.48n, ×10-6; P = 0.002) and apolipoprotein A-I (+0.05 g/L; P = 0.01) concentrations were observed following the 1-cup/d intervention. Treatment compliance was 94.1% (wrapper returns) and total concentrations of anthocyanin-derived phenolic acid metabolites significantly increased, dose-dependently, in serum and 24-h urine (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). Insulin resistance, pulse wave velocity, blood pressure, NO, and overall plasma thiol status were unaffected. Likewise, a half cup per day had no effect on any biomarkers.Despite insulin resistance remaining unchanged we show, to our knowledge, the first sustained improvements in vascular function, lipid status, and underlying NO bioactivity following 1 cup blueberries/d.

CT subjects have normal-range hormonal profiles and food intake but exhibit resistance to weight gain despite living in the modern world's obesogenic environment.The goal of this study is to identify molecular mechanisms underlying this protective phenotype against weight gain.We conducted a clinical overfeeding study on 30 CT subjects and 30 controls (BMI 20-25 kg/) matched for age and sex. We performed clinical and integrative molecular and transcriptomic analyses on white adipose and muscle tissues.Our results demonstrate that adipocytes were markedly smaller in CT individuals (mean ± SEM: 2174 ± 142 μm 2) compared with controls (3586 ± 216 μ) (P < 0.01). The mitochondrial respiratory capacity was higher in CT adipose tissue, particularly at the level of complex II of the electron transport chain (2.2-fold increase; P < 0.01). This higher activity was paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial number (CT compared with control: 784 ± 27 compared with 675 ± 30 mitochondrial DNA molecules per cell; P < 0.05). No evidence for uncoupled respiration or "browning" of the white adipose tissue was found. In accordance with the mitochondrial differences, CT subjects had a distinct adipose transcriptomic profile [62 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate of 0.1 and log fold change >0.75)], with many differentially expressed genes associating with positive metabolic outcomes. Pathway analyses revealed an increase in fatty acid oxidation ( P = 3 × 10-04) but also triglyceride biosynthesis (P = 3.6 × 10-04). No differential response to the overfeeding was observed in the 2 groups.The distinct molecular signature of the adipose tissue in CT individuals suggests the presence of augm ented futile  cycling, rather than mitochondrial uncoupling, as a way to increase energy expenditure in CT individuals. We propose that increased mitochondrial function in adipose tissue is an important mediator in sustaining the low body weight in CT individuals.

Particularly, obesity-induced metabolic endotoxemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and inflammation. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key regulator of antioxidant signaling that serves as a primary cellular defense against the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress. Pharmacological stimulation of Nrf2 mitigates obesity and insulin resistance in mice; however, Nrf2 activators are not clinically available due to biosafety concerns. A recent study demonstrated that glucoraphanin, a precursor of the Nrf2 activator sulforaphane, ameliorates obesity by enhancing energy expenditure and browning of white adipose tissue, and attenuates obesity-related inflammation and insulin resistance by polarizing  macrophages and reducing metabolic endotoxemia. Thus, this review focuses on the efficiency and safety of glucoraphanin in alleviating obesity, insulin resistance, and NAFLD.

To verify the therapeutic effects of saponin-enriched extracts of  (SPA) on the anti-inflammatory response and on the cholinergic regulation in the gastrointestinal system, an alteration on the constipation phenotypes, on the inflammatory responses, and on the muscarinic cholinergic regulation were investigated in the transverse colons of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats with loperamide (Lop)-induced constipation after the treatment of SPA. Significant increases were observed on the total number of stools, the gastrointestinal transit, the thickness of the mucosal layer, the flat luminal surface, the number of paneth cells, and the  droplets in the Lop + SPA-treated group as compared to the Lop + Vehicle-treated group. SPA treatment induced the recovery of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β) and IL-6), inflammatory mediators (NF-κB and iNOS), the total number of infiltered mast cells, and mucin secretion. Also, some similar improvements were observed on the levels of acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity and on the phosphorylation of myosin light chains (MLC) as well as the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors /M3 (mAChR /M3) and their mediators.

Bone marrow (BM)-derived cells are key players in atherogenesis but whether Ang II induces plaque vulnerability directly through Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) activation on these cells remains to be clarified. In the present study, we investigated whether a lack of AT1R on BM-derived cells might affect Ang II-mediated vulnerable plaque development. The 2-kidney, 1-clip (2K1C) model (Ang II-dependent mouse model of advanced atherosclerosis and vulnerable plaques) was generated in ApoE mice transplanted with AT1aR or AT1aR BM. Plasma cholesterol as well as hepatic mRNA expression levels of genes involved in cholesterol  were significantly lower in 2K1C mice transplanted with AT1aR BM than in controls. Atherosclerotic lesions were significantly smaller in AT1aR BM 2K1C mice (-79% in the aortic sinus and -71% in whole aorta compared to controls). Plaques from AT1aR BM 2K1C mice exhibited reduced  core/fibrous cap and macrophage/smooth muscle cells ratios (-82% and -88%, respectively), and increased collagen content (+70%), indicating a more stable phenotype. Moreover, aortic mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12p35, IL-1β, and TNF-α were significantly reduced in AT1aR BM 2K1C mice. No significant differences in either the number of circulating Ly6C inflammatory monocytes and Ly6C resident anti-inflammatory monocyte subsets, or in mRNA levels of aortic M1 or  macrophage markers were observed between the two groups. No significant differences were observed in splenic mRNA levels of T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg) markers between the two groups.

Despite recent advances in the understanding of its pathophysiology, asthma remains a major public health problem and, at present, there are no effective interventions capable of reversing airway remodeling. Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based therapy mitigates lung inflammation in experimental allergic asthma; however, its ability to reduce airway remodeling is limited. We aimed to investigate whether pre-treatment with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) potentiates the therapeutic properties of MSCs in experimental allergic asthma. Seventy-two C57BL/6 mice were used. House dust mite (HDM) extract was intranasally administered to induce severe allergic asthma in mice. Unstimulated or EPA-stimulated MSCs were administered intratracheally 24 h after final HDM challenge. Lung mechanics, histology, protein levels of biomarkers, and cellularity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), thymus, lymph nodes, and bone marrow were analyzed. Furthermore, the effects of EPA on  body formation and secretion of resolvin-D (RvD), prostaglandin E (PGE), interleukin (IL)-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 by MSCs were evaluated . EPA-stimulated MSCs, compared to unstimulated MSCs, yielded greater therapeutic effects by further reducing bronchoconstriction, alveolar collapse, total cell counts (in BALF, bone marrow, and lymph nodes), and collagen fiber content in airways, while increasing IL-10 levels in BALF and  macrophage counts in lungs. In conclusion, EPA potentiated MSC-based therapy in experimental allergic asthma, leading to increased secretion of pro-resolution and anti-inflammatory mediators (RvD, PGE, IL-10, and TGF-β), modulation of macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, and reduction in the remodeling process. Taken together, these modifications may explain the greater improvement in lung mechanics obtained. This may be a promising novel strategy to potentiate MSCs effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30204755>Associations of device-measured physical activity across adolescence with metabolic traits: Prospective cohort study.</a></h2><p>Multiple occasions of device-measured physical activity have not been previously examined in relation to metabolic traits. We described associations of total activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and sedentary time from three accelerometry measures taken across adolescence with detailed traits related to systemic .There were 1,826 male and female participants recruited at birth in 1991-1992 via mothers into the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children offspring cohort who attended clinics in 2003-2005, 2005-2006, and 2006-2008 who were included in ≥1 analysis. Waist-worn uniaxial accelerometers measured total activity (counts/min), MVPA (min/d), and sedentary time (min/d) over ≥3 d at mean age 12y, 14y, and 15y. Current activity (at age 15y), mean activity across occasions, interaction by previous activity, and change in activity were examined in relation to systolic and diastolic blood pressure, insulin, C-reactive protein, and 230 traits from targeted metabolomics (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), including lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, amino and fatty acids, glycoprotein acetyls, and others, at age 15y. Mean current total activity was 477.5 counts/min (SD = 164.0) while mean MVPA and sedentary time durations were 23.6 min/d (SD = 17.9) and 522.1 min/d (SD = 66.0), respectively. Mean body mass index at age 15y was 21.4 kg/ (SD = 3.5). Correlations between first and last activity measurement occasions were low (e.g., r = 0.40 for counts/min). Current activity was most strongly associated with cholesterol and triglycerides in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles (e.g., -0.002 mmol/l or -0.18 SD units; 95% CI -0.24--0.11 for triglycerides in chylomicrons and extremely large very low-density lipoprotein [XL VLDL]) and with glycoprotein acetyls (-0.02 mmol/l or -0.16 SD units; 95% CI -0.22--0.10), among others. Associations were similar for mean activity across 3 occasions. Attenuations were modest with adjustment for  mass index based on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In mutually adjusted models, higher MVPA and sedentary time were oppositely associated with cholesterol and triglycerides in VLDL and HDL particles (MVPA more strongly with glycoprotein acetyls and sedentary time more strongly with amino acids). Associations appeared less consistent for sedentary time than for MVPA based on longer-term measures and were weak for change in all activity types from age 12y-15y. Evidence was also weak for interaction between activity types at age 15y and previous activity measures in relation to most traits (minimum P = 0.003; median P = 0.26 for counts/min) with interaction coefficients mostly positive. Study limitations include modest sample sizes and relatively short durations of accelerometry measurement on each occasion (3-7 d) and of time lengths between first and last accelerometry occasions (<4 years), which can obscure patterns from chance variation and limit description of activity trajectories. Activity was also recorded using uniaxial accelerometers which predated more sensitive triaxial devices.Our results support associations of physical activity with metabolic traits that are small in magnitude and more robust for higher MVPA than lower sedentary time. Activity fluctuates over time, but associations of current activity with most metabolic traits do not differ by previous activity. This suggests that the metabolic effects of physical activity, if causal, depend on most recent engagement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30496252>Obesity matters but is not perceived: A cross-sectional study on cardiovascular disease risk factors among a population-based probability sample in rural Zambia.</a></h2><p>Sub-Saharan Africa, including Zambia, has experienced an increase in overweight and obesity due to rapid lifestyle changes associated with recent economic growth. We explored the prevalence and correlates of overweight and obesity in rural Zambia. We also investigated the role of self-perception of body weight in weight control given the local socio-cultural context.In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 690 residents of the Mumbwa district aged 25-64 years through a multistage, clustered, household random sampling. We administered a questionnaire and collected anthropometric and bio-behavioral data from May to July 2016. Factors associated with body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/ and underestimation of body weight were assessed using multiple logistic regression.Of the weighted sample of 689 participants (335 men and 354 women), 185 (26.8%) had BMI ≥25 kg/. In multivariate analyses, female gender, age 45-64 years, tertiary education, higher fruit and vegetable intake, high blood pressure, abnormal blood  profile, and Hemoglobin A1c ≥5.7% were significantly associated with BMI ≥25 kg/. Among participants with BMI ≥25 kg/, 14.2% and 58.2% perceived themselves as being underweight and normal weight, respectively. Age 45-64 years was the only factor significantly associated with body weight underestimation. Preference for obesity was reported by 17.5% and 3.6% of respondents with BMI <25 kg/ and BMI≥25 kg/, respectively; "looks attractive" and "fear of being perceived as HIV-positive" were the main reasons.In rural Zambia, overweight and obesity are prevalent and significantly associated with alterations in blood pressure, blood  profile, and glucose . However, most subjects with BMI ≥25 kg/ underestimated their body weight; some preferred obesity, in part due to cultural factors and HIV-related stigma. A health promotion program that addresses such perceptions and body weight underestimation should be urgently introduced in Zambia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548175>The role of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of atherosclerosis through the regulation of macrophage activity.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis (AS) is the main cause of ischemic cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular diseases. Macrophage activity has been proven to play a critical role during the AS pathological process, which involves the adhesion, aggregation of mononuclear-macrophages, cell differentiation of M1/ macrophages as part of complex mechanisms occurring during , apoptosis, autophagy, inflammation and immune reaction. Therefore, the development of effective AS treatments is likely to target macrophage activity. Certain herbal extracts (such as Salvia miltiorrhiza) have exhibited enormous potential for AS treatment in the past. Here, we aim to provide a summary on the current understanding of the type of action and the underlying target/pathway in macrophage regulation of certain herbal extracts used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for treatment of AS.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, the anti-obesity effects of two Lactobacillus plantarum strains (DSR  and DSR 920) isolated from kimchi are investigated.Mice are fed a normal or high- diet with or without DSR  and DSR 920 (DSR, 1 × 10 CFU d ) for 12 weeks. DSR improves the obesity state, as evidenced by the i) suppressed obesity-related markers, e.g., gains in body weight and  mass, ii) reduced serum and liver triglyceride levels, iii) upregulated β-oxidation and downregulated lipogenesis-related genes in the liver, iv) reduced serum leptin levels, v) altered microbial communities, vi) increased regulatory T cell immunity, and vii) suppressed inflammatory response. In addition, correlation analysis shows that Akkermansia muciniphila and the genus Anaerostipes, which are increased in the DSR group, are negatively correlated with obesity-related markers, but Mucispirillum schaedleri, which is increased in the high--diet (HFD) group, is positively correlated with serum leptin level.Lactobacillus plantarum DSR  and DSR 920 are candidate probiotics for the prevention and amelioration of obesity.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, treatment modalities targeting ATMs remain limited. The effects of lycopene, an antioxidant carotenoid compound, on adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in high  (HF)-diet-induced obese mice are examined.C57BL/6J mice are fed an HF diet or an HF diet containing lycopene (HF+LY) for 8 weeks. Lycopene attenuates HF-diet-induced glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. Compared with HF mice, HF+LY mice exhibit attenuated adipocyte hypertrophy and macrophage infiltration in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Flow cytometry analysis of ATMs demonstrates that lycopene attenuated the increased number of ATMs in HF diet-fed mice. In addition, HF+LY mice have 23% fewer M1-polarized ATMs and 60% more -polarized ATMs than HF mice, resulting in the predominance of  over M1 in the ATM population. -dominant polarization is also seen in hepatic macrophages in HF+LY mice. Moreover, lycopene promotes IL-4-induced  polarization by increasing the phosphorylation levels of STAT6 and Akt in Raw 264.7 macrophages.Lycopene facilitates -dominant polarization in ATM, thereby attenuating HF diet-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in eWAT and the liver.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, evidence relating to bile acids and intestinal tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on the intestinal mucosal barrier and its impact on the development of CRC. Here we showed that DCA disrupted cell monolayer integrity and increased proinflammatory cytokine production in intestinal cancer and precancerous cell lines (Caco-2 and IMCE). Apcmin/+ mice receiving DCA increased the number and size of intestinal adenomas and promoted the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Importantly, DCA induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, and led to intestinal low grade inflammation. A reduction of tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and the number of intestinal cells including goblet cells and Paneth cells was also observed after DCA treatment. Moreover, DCA significantly reduced the level of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and promoted the polarization of  macrophages in the intestine of Apcmin/+ mice. In conclusion, these data suggested that DCA induced intestinal low grade inflammation and disrupted the mucosal physical and functional barriers, aggravating intestinal tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30108504>Nrf2 Activation Provides Atheroprotection in Diabetic Mice Through Concerted Upregulation of Antioxidant, Anti-inflammatory, and Autophagy Mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Interactive relationships between , inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy in the vascular system play a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular disease. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a stress-sensitive guarantor of cellular homeostasis, which cytoprotective contributions extend beyond the antioxidant defense. We investigated the beneficial effects and underlying mechanisms of the Nrf2 inducer tert-butyl hydroquinone (tBHQ) on diabetes-driven atherosclerosis. In the experimental model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, treatment with tBHQ increased Nrf2 activity in macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells within atherosclerotic lesions. Moreover, tBHQ significantly decreased the size, extension and  content of atheroma plaques, and attenuated inflammation by reducing lesional macrophages (total number and M1/ phenotype balance), foam cell size and chemokine expression. Atheroprotection was accompanied by both systemic and local antioxidant effects, characterized by lower levels of superoxide anion and oxidative DNA marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, reduced expression of NADPH oxidase subunits, and increased antioxidant capacity. Interestingly, tBHQ treatment upregulated the gene and protein expression of autophagy-related molecules and also enhanced autophagic flux in diabetic mouse aorta. , Nrf2 activation by tBHQ suppressed cytokine-induced expression of pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress genes, altered macrophage phenotypes, and promoted autophagic activity. Our results reinforce pharmacological Nrf2 activation as a promising atheroprotective approach in diabetes, according to the plethora of cytoprotective mechanisms involved in the resolution of inflammation and oxidative stress, and restoring autophagy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30450765>Sestrin2 regulates monocyte activation through AMPK-mTOR nexus under high-glucose and dyslipidemic conditions.</a></h2><p>The vicious cycle between hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance results in the progression of atherosclerosis in the vessel wall. The complex interaction between hyperglycemia and lipoprotein abnormalities promotes the development of atherogenesis. In the early phase of atherosclerosis, macrophage-derived foam cells play an important role in vascular remodeling. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has been identified to play an essential role in the initiation, progression, and complication of atherosclerosis. Recently sestrin2, an antioxidant, was shown to modulate TOR activity and thereby regulating glucose and . But the role of sestrin2 in monocyte activation is still not clearly understood. Hence, this study is focussed on investigating the role of sestrin2 in monocyte activation under hyperglycemic and dyslipidemic conditions. High-glucose and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) treatments mediated proinflammatory cytokine production (M1) with a concomitant decrease in the anti-inflammatory cytokine () levels in human monocytic THP1 cells. Both glucose and oxidized LDL (OxLDL) in a dose and time-dependent manner increased the mTOR activation with a marked reduction in the levels of pAMPK and sestrin2 expression. Both high-glucose and OxLDL treatment increased foam cell formation and adhesion of THP1 cells to endothelial cells. Experiments employing activator or inhibitor of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) as well as overexpression or silencing of sestrin2 indicated that high-glucose mediated monocyte polarization and adhesion of monocytes to the endothelial cells were appeared to be programmed via sestrin2-AMPK-mTOR nexus. Our results evidently suggest that sestrin2 plays a major role in regulating monocyte activation via the AMPK-mTOR-pathway under diabetic and dyslipidemic conditions and also AMPK regulates sestrin2 in a feedback mechanism.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30689902>Clinical Features of Nonobese, Apparently Healthy, Japanese Men With Reduced Adipose Tissue Insulin Sensitivity.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue insulin resistance has been observed in obese subjects and is considered an early metabolic defect that precedes insulin resistance in muscle and liver. Although Asians can readily develop metabolic disease without obesity, the clinical features of nonobese, apparently healthy, Asians with reduced adipose tissue insulin sensitivity (ATIS) have not been elucidated.To investigate the clinical parameters associated with reduced ATIS in nonobese, apparently healthy (body mass index <25 kg/), Japanese men.We studied 52 nonobese Japanese men without cardiometabolic risk factors. Using a two-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with a glucose tracer, we evaluated the insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. ATIS was calculated as the percentage of free fatty acid (FFA) suppression/insulin concentration during the first step of the glucose clamp.Using the median ATIS value, the subjects were divided into low- and high-FFA suppression groups. The low-FFA suppression group had moderate  accumulation in the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver. Compared with the high-FFA group, they also had a lower fitness level, decreased insulin clearance, impaired insulin sensitivity in muscle, moderately elevated triglycerides, and lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. All these factors correlated significantly with ATIS. Hepatic insulin sensitivity was comparable between the two groups.In nonobese, apparently healthy, Japanese men, reduced ATIS was associated with moderate  accumulation in subcutaneous  and liver, lower insulin clearance, muscle insulin resistance, and moderate lipedema. These data suggest that reduced ATIS can occur early in the development of the metabolic syndrome, even in nonobese, apparently healthy, men.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30590596>Plasma Response to Deuterium-Labeled Vitamin K Intake Varies by TG Response, but Not Age or Vitamin K Status, in Older and Younger Adults.</a></h2><p>Phylloquinone is the primary form of vitamin K in the diet and circulation. Large intra- and interindividual variances in circulating phylloquinone have been partially attributed to age. However, little is known about the nondietary factors that influence phylloquinone absorption and . Similarly, it is not known if phylloquinone absorption is altered by the individual's existing vitamin K status.The purpose of this secondary substudy was to compare plasma response with deuterium-labeled phylloquinone intake in older and younger adults after dietary phylloquinone depletion and repletion.Forty-two older [mean ± SD age: 67.2 ± 8.0 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/): 25.4 ± 4.6; n = 12 men, 9 women] and younger (mean ± SEM age: 31.8 ± 6.6 y; BMI: 25.5 ± 3.3; n = 9 men, 12 women) adults were maintained on sequential 28-d phylloquinone depletion (∼10 µg phylloquinone/d) and 28-d phylloquinone repletion (∼500 µg phylloquinone/d) diets. On the 23rd d of each diet phase, participants consumed deuterated phylloquinone-rich collard greens (2H-phylloquinone). Plasma and urinary outcome measures over 72 h were compared by age group, sex, and dietary phase via 2-factor repeated-measures ANOVA.The plasma 2H-phylloquinone area under the curve (AUC) did not differ in response to phylloquinone depletion or repletion, but was 34% higher in older than in younger adults (P = 0.02). However, plasma 2H-phylloquinone AUC was highly correlated with the serum triglyceride (TG) AUC (r2 = 0.45). After adjustment for serum TG response, the age effect on the plasma 2H-phylloquinone AUC was no longer significant.Plasma 2H-phylloquinone response did not differ between phylloquinone depletion and repletion in older and younger adults. The age effect observed was explained by the serum TG response and was completely attenuated after adjustment. Plasma response to phylloquinone intake, therefore, seems to be a predominantly -driven effect and not dependent on existing vitamin K status. More research is required to differentiate the effect of endogenous compared with exogenous lipids on phylloquinone absorption.

In all, twelve healthy lean males (21·5 (sd 0·5) years old; BMI: 22·5 (sd 1·7) kg/) participated in this study. Body composition, aerobic capacity, food preferences and energy intake were assessed. They randomly completed three conditions: (i) no depletion (CON); (ii) full 24-h energy restrictions (Def-EI); and (iii) exercise condition (Def-EX). Ad libitum energy intake and food reward were assessed at the end of each session. Appetite feelings were assessed regularly. Ad libitum energy intake was higher on Def-EI (7330 (sd 2975) kJ (1752 (sd 711) kcal) compared with that on CON (5301 (sd 1205) kJ (1267 (sd 288) kcal)) (P<0·05), with no difference between CON and Def-EX (6238 (sd 1741) kJ (1491 (sd 416) kcal) (P=0·38) and between Def-EX and Def-EI (P=0·22). There was no difference in the percent energy ingested from macronutrients. Hunger was lower on CON and Def-EX compared with Def-EI (P<0·001).

The effect of breakfast omission on energy balance when exercise is prescribed is unclear.The aim of this study was to assess the effect on 24-h energy balance of omitting compared with consuming breakfast prior to exercise.Twelve healthy physically active young men (age 23 ± 3 y, body mass index 23.6 ± 2.0 kg/) completed 3 trials in a randomized order (separated by >1 week): a breakfast of oats and milk (431 kcal; 65 g carbohydrate, 11 g , 19 g protein) followed by rest (BR); breakfast before exercise (BE; 60 min cycling at 50 % peak power output); and overnight fasting before exercise (FE). The 24-h energy intake was calculated based on the food consumed for breakfast, followed by an ad libitum lunch, snacks, and dinner. Indirect calorimetry with heart-rate accelerometry was used to measure substrate utilization and 24-h energy expenditure. A [6,6-2H2]glucose infusion was used to investigate tissue-specific carbohydrate utilization.The 24-h energy balance was -400 kcal (normalized 95% CI: -230, -571 kcal) for the FE trial; this was significantly lower than both the BR trial (492 kcal; normalized 95% CI: 332, 652 kcal) and the BE trial (7 kcal; normalized 95% CI: -153, 177 kcal; both P < 0.01 compared with FE). Plasma glucose utilization in FE (mainly representing liver glucose utilization) was positively correlated with energy intake compensation at lunch (r = 0.62, P = 0.03), suggesting liver carbohydrate plays a role in postexercise energy-balance regulation.Neither exercise energy expenditure nor restricted energy intake via breakfast omission were completely compensated for postexercise. In healthy men, pre-exercise breakfast omission creates a more negative daily energy balance and could therefore be a useful strategy to induce a short-term energy deficit.

MTsc1KO mice were protected from HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. MTsc1KO, however, displayed, independently of the diet, abnormal behavior, episodes of intense movement, and muscle spasms followed by temporary paralysis. To investigate whether obesity protection was due to myeloid cells Tsc1 deletion, bone marrow was transplanted from MTsc1WT and MTsc1KO into irradiated C57BL6/J mice. Mice transplanted with MTsc1KO bone marrow displayed reduced body weight gain, adiposity, and inflammation, and enhanced energy expenditure, glucose tolerance and adipose tissue  macrophage content upon HFD feeding, in the absence of abnormal behavior.

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a means of determining body composition and body fat distribution at different sites including whole body and trunk-locations where there tends to be high correlation at an individual level.We performed an analysis of DXA-derived metrics of adiposity (truncal fat %,subtotal fat % and total fat %) from the NHANES database and then correlated the findings with markers of insulin resistance. We analyzed the data from DXA scans in NHANES 1999-2004. Homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance and HOMA-β (beta-cell function) were estimated. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated (ρ) between HOMA-IR,HOMA-β and different measures of obesity (Waist circumference(in cm), Body Mass Index (kg/), truncal fat %, subtotal fat % as well as total fat %) to gauge the relationship between markers of glucose homeostasis and DXA derived metrics of obesity. We also performed logarithmic transformation of HOMA-IR as well as HOMA-β to ensure normality of distribution and to meet the criteria for regression analysis. A forward selection model (by outcome and gender) was performed to predict log transformed insulin resistance (log HOMA-IR) as well as log transformed HOMA-β (log HOMA-β,measure of beta cell function) from age, serum triglycerides, HDL, trunk fat % and the SBP (in both males and females separately), after reviewing the spearman correlation coefficients.There were a total of 6147 men and 6369 women who were part of the study cohort. There was a positive correlation between markers of adiposity and log HOMA-IR and log HOMA-β in both males and females.Truncal fat % had the highest nonparametric correlation coefficent with log HOMA-IR among the DXA derived fat% (0.54 in males and 048 in females). In the multivariate analysis, truncal fat % was an independent predictor of logHOMA-IR as well as logHOMA-β. In males, the significant predictors of log HOMA-IR were; age, truncal fat % and HDL cholesterol (Adjusted R square of 0.325 (±0.66), F(3,207) = 34.63, p < .01).

In all, thirty-six subjects (nineteen men, seventeen women) consisting of sixteen excess-weight (BMI: 27·1 (sd 1·7) kg/) and twenty healthy-weight (BMI: 22·3 (sd 1·8) kg/) individuals participated. Subjects performed 1 h of slow-paced intermittent jogging three times per d and other leisure activities, whereas consuming only provided foods without water restriction. Body mass significantly decreased from pre- to post-intervention in excess-weight and healthy-weight individuals (-3·5 (sd 1·5) and -3·5 (sd 1·3) %, respectively; P<0·001 for both), and losses were maintained at 12 weeks post-intervention in both groups (-6·3 (sd 3·8) and -1·7 (sd 4·0) %, respectively; P<0·01 for both).  mass also significantly decreased in both groups (excess weight: -9·2 (sd 4·6) %: healthy weight: -13·4 (sd 9·0) %; P<0·01 for both), whereas FFM was maintained. Similar improvements were observed for blood biochemistry and pressure in both groups. This short-term weight loss intervention yielded favourable outcomes in both excess- and healthy-weight adults, particularly a 3·5 % weight loss with no significant change to FFM. In addition, participants maintained weight loss for at least 12 weeks. Of multiple programme choices, the Health Tourism weight loss programme's results indicate that it is a viable option.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29645064>Adiponectin expression in visceral adiposity is an important determinant of insulin resistance in morbid obesity.</a></h2><p>Visceral adiposity is associated with decreased serum adiponectin levels, peripheral resistance to insulin and an increased risk of cardio-metabolic complications. However, the link between adiponectin expression in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), its serum levels and metabolic protection is controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the adiponectin gene expression in VAT and clinical and metabolic parameters in patients with severe obesity.This is a cross-sectional study that included 51 severely obese patients (age 43.24±11.29 years, BMI 45.13±8.67 kg/), extensively evaluated clinically and biologically (metabolic tests, serum adiponectin measurements, HOMA-IR) before bariatric surgery. Omental adipose tissue was sampled during the intervention and the relative quantification of adiponectin gene expression was performed by real-time PCR, using beta-actin as reference gene.Adiponectin mRNA in VAT was significantly higher in obese insulin-sensitive patients than in the rest of obese patients (p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with HOMA-IR (r =-0.354, p=0.016) and uric acid (r =-0.304, p=0.045). After adjustment for gender, TG/HDL ratio and uric acid, adiponectin expresion (β= -0.439, p=0.001), waist circumference (β=0.467, p=0.001) and serum adiponectin (β =-0.339, p=0.011) remained significantly associated with HOMA-IR, together explaining more than 50% of its variation.In severely obese patients, adiponectin gene expression in VAT is negatively correlated with serum levels of uric acid and is an independent determinant, together with anthropometric parameters of visceral obesity and serum adiponectin levels, of insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30468993>Gingival mesenchymal stem cells attenuate pro-inflammatory macrophages stimulated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein and modulate .</a></h2><p>To examine the effects of gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) on inflammatory macrophages upon oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) stimulation and evaluate therapeutic potential of GMSCs on mouse model of periodontitis associated with hyperlipidemia.in vitro, GMSCs were co-cultured with macrophages for 48 h in the absence or presence of M1 polarizing conditions and oxidized low-density lipoprotein in the transwell system. The supernatants were collected for ELISA. M1 and  markers of macrophages were analyzed by flow cytometry and PCR, and  accumulation was assessed by oil red O staining. in vivo, eighteen mice were divided into three groups (n = 6): Group A (periodontally healthy mice as control), Group B (periodontitis mice with hyperlipidemia), Group C (periodontitis mice with hyperlipidemia with the transplantation of GMSCs). The serum levels of cholesterol and inflammatory factors were measured by automatic analyzer. Bone regeneration was evaluated by Masson staining.When co-cultured with GMSCs, the M1 markers of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) -α, Interleukin (IL) -6, Interleukin (IL) -1β, CD86, and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) -DR were significantly reduced. In contrast,  markers such as Interleukin(IL) -10 and CD206 were moderately increased. Similar results were obtained in the cell culture supernatants. In animal experiment, GMSCs suppressed the expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP-1c) and elevated the levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and peroxisome proliferator activator receptor- coactivator 1(PGC-1α) in the liver, attenuated cholesterol dysfunction via the downregulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol (TC), and the upregulation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and decreased the levels of TNF-α and IL-6. Moreover, GMSC treatment improved bone regeneration.GMSCs inhibit the activation of M1 macrophages, regulate  and reduce inflammatory response, and promote bone regeneration in mouse model of periodontitis associated with hyperlipidemia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Food and nonfood images were shown in a randomized block design. Brain activation (food compared with nonfood images) was correlated with anthropometric and behavioral variables. Behavioral variables included eating behavior [Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ)] and habitual physical activity (Baecke). Glucose and insulin concentrations, determined during an oral-glucose challenge, were used to assess the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and Matsuda ISI.Food compared with nonfood brain activation was positively associated with HOMA-IR in the nucleus accumbens, right and left insula, and right cingulate gyrus (P < 0.005, corrected for multiple comparisons). TFEQ factor 2 was positively related to food compared with nonfood brain activation in the supramarginal gyrus (P < 0.005, corrected for multiple comparisons). Habitual physical activity during leisure time was negatively associated with food compared with nonfood brain activation in multiple regions associated with the attention and reward network (P < 0.005, corrected for multiple comparisons).Individuals with increased insulin resistance and emotional eating or disinhibition showed higher brain reactivity to food cues, which may imply changes in food preference and hyperphagia.

Several of the changes we observed, including enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory genes and dysregulated UPR and  genes were first observed in the liver followed by the pancreas. In the present study we investigated further early changes in hepatic innate immunity and  in two models of type 1 diabetes (T1D), the BBdp rat and NOD mouse. There was a striking increase in  deposits in liver, particularly in neonatal BBdp rats, with a less striking but significant increase in neonatal NOD mice in association with dysregulated expression of  genes. This was associated with a decreased number of extramedullary hematopoietic clusters as well as CD68 macrophages in the liver of both models. In addition, PPARɣ and phosphorylated AMPKα protein were decreased in neonatal BBdp rats. BBdp rats displayed decreased expression of antimicrobial genes in neonates and decreased  genes at 30 days. This suggests hepatic steatosis could be a common early feature in development of T1D that impacts metabolic homeostasis and tolerogenic phenotype in the prediabetic liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30496579>Prepregnancy  Free Mass and Associations to Glucose  Before and During Pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Our aim was to quantify the individual contribution of prepregnancy (PP) -free mass (FFM), expressed as [PP-FFM index (PP-FFMI) = FFM (kg)/height ()], on markers of glucose homeostasis before and during pregnancy.Body composition was assessed in 43 women before pregnancy using air-displacement plethysmography. Blood was drawn at PP and gestational weeks ∼8 and 30. Relationships between body composition (independent) variables and glucose homeostasis (dependent) variables were assessed using adjusted correlations and simple and multiple linear regression analyses.PP-FFMI was the strongest predictor of plasma insulin concentration [squared partial correlation (Pr2) = 17, P = 0.007] and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) (Pr2 = 16, P = 0.010). At gestation week 30, PP-FFMI and gestational weight gain (GWG) were the strongest predictors of insulin concentration (PP-FFMI: Pr2 = 20, P = 0.010; GWG: Pr2 = 12, P = 0.052) and HOMA2-IR (PP-FFMI: Pr2 = 19, P = 0.012; GWG: Pr2 = 13, P = 0.045). After accounting for PP  mass index (PP-FMI), PP-FFMI and GWG were independently associated with first-phase insulin response (PP-FFMI: Pr2 = 20, P = 0.009; GWG: Pr2 = 15, P = 0.025) and second-phase insulin response (PP-FFMI: Pr2 = 19, P = 0.011; GWG: Pr2 = 17, P = 0.016). PP-FMI was the strongest predictor of an oral glucose tolerance test‒derived estimated metabolic clearance rate of glucose (PP-FMI: Pr2 = 14, P = 0.037) and estimated insulin sensitivity index (PP-FMI: Pr2 = 13, P = 0.047).PP-FFMI was a predictor of markers of glucose homeostasis before and during pregnancy.

MerTK is mainly expressed in anti-inflammatory  macrophages where it mediates transcriptional changes including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancement of inflammatory repressors. MerTK is regulated by   through nuclear sensors including LXRs, PPARs, and RXRs, in response to apoptotic bodies or to other sources of cholesterol. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. It is a clinicopathological syndrome closely related to obesity, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. It includes a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis, characterized by hepatic fat accumulation with or without inflammation, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined by hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and accumulating fibrosis. Several studies support an association between NAFLD and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a major cause of death worldwide. This pathological condition consists in a chronic and progressive inflammatory process in the intimal layer of large- and medium-sized arteries. The complications of advanced atherosclerosis include chronic or acute ischemic damage in the tissue perfused by the affected artery, leading to cellular death. By identifying specific targets influencing lipid  and cardiovascular-related diseases, the present review highlights the role of MerTK in NAFLD-associated atherosclerotic lesions as a potential innovative therapeutic target. Therapeutic advantages might derive from the use of compounds selective for nuclear receptors targeting PPARs rather than LXRs regulating macrophage lipid  and macrophage mediated inflammation, by favoring the expression of MerTK, which mediates an immunoregulatory action with a reduction in inflammation and in atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29581238>Role of dysfunctional adipocytes in cholesterol-induced nonobese metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Many studies have reported the causes of obese metabolic syndrome (MS); however, the causes of nonobese MS (NMS) remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that inflamed dysfunctional adipose tissue plays a crucial role in cholesterol-induced NMS. Control (C), high cholesterol (HC) and HC with 10% fructose in drinking water (HCF) diets were fed to Sprague-Dawley rats for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the body weights of the C- and HC-fed rats were comparable, but the weights of the HCF-fed rats were relatively low. Cholesterol caused metabolic problems such as high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia and hypoinsulinemia. The HCF-fed rats exhibited whole-body insulin resistance with low circulating high-density lipoprotein levels. Increases in the tumor necrosis factor α level in the plasma, the number of CD68+ macrophages and the free nuclear factor-κB level in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) resulted in local inflammation, which appeared as inflamed dysfunctional gWAT. Reduced superoxide dismutases (SODs) deteriorate natural antioxidant defense systems and induce reactive oxygen species in gWAT. Dysregulation of plasma levels of catecholamine, adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin in cholesterol-induced inflamed adipose tissue contributed to increased lipolysis and increased circulating nonesterified fatty acids. Cholesterol activated inflammation, lipolysis and cell death in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, Chol-3T3-CM reduced the population of -type Raw264.7 macrophages, indicating that the macrophage polarization is mediated by cholesterol. Together, our findings indicate that inflamed dysfunctional adipocytes are critical in NMS, supporting the development of anti-inflammatory agents as potential therapeutic drugs for treating NMS.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574574>Adzuki Bean Water Extract Attenuates Obesity by Modulating /M1 Macrophage Polarization and Gut Microbiota Composition.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a chronic condition resulting in excessive  accumulation in adipose tissues. Adipose tissue is now considered as an immune organ, at the crossroads between  and immunity. Thus, this study investigates the effects of adzuki beans on obesity and gut microbiota in high  diet-induced mice.In this study, adzuki bean hot water extract (AWE) is determined to have the most significant anti-adipogenic effect; it is able to inhibit  accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and reduces body weight and adipose tissue weight in a dose-dependent manner. AWE treatment also decreases M1-polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) while inducing -polarized ATMs. The number and size of  vacuoles in liver lesions are significantly reduced, indicating that AWE could ameliorate steatosis in high  diet-induced mice. The results also demonstrate that AWE-treated groups inhibit adipogenesis via activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reduce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α expression. Moreover, the studies confirm that AWE decreases obesity through modulating gut microbiota.The results demonstrate that AWE supplementation ameliorates high  diet-induced obesity and gut microbiota composition and suggests that AWE may have the potential to be developed into a functional food to improve metabolic disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Understanding of how these events occur in synchrony with metabolic changes could have important therapeutic implications. For biosynthesis, cancer cells enhance glucose and glutamine consumption. Inactivation of pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) promotes transcription in G1 phase. Glutamine  supports DNA replication in S phase and  synthesis in G2 phase. A boost in glycolysis and oxidative  can temporarily furnish more ATP when necessary (G1/S transition, segregation of chromosomes). Recent studies have shown that a few metabolic enzymes [PKM2, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase (PFKFB3), GAPDH] also periodically translocate to the nucleus and oversee cell cycle regulators or oncogene expression (c-Myc).

Resting energy expenditure, substrate , skin temperature, thermal comfort perception, superficial muscle activity, hemodynamics of the forearm and abdominal regions, and heart rate variability were measured under warm conditions (22.7 ± 0.2°C) and during an individualized cooling protocol (air-conditioning and water cooling vest) in a cold room (19.4 ± 0.1°C). The temperature of the cooling vest started at 16.6°C and decreased ~ 1.4°C every 10 minutes until participants shivered (93.5 ± 26.3 min). All measurements were analysed across 4 periods: warm period, at 31% and at 64% of individual´s cold exposure time until shivering occurred, and at the shivering threshold. Energy expenditure increased from warm period to 31% of cold exposure by 16.7% (P = 0.078) and to the shivering threshold by 31.7% (P = 0.023).  oxidation increased by 72.6% from warm period to 31% of cold exposure (P = 0.004), whereas no changes occurred in carbohydrates oxidation. As shivering came closer, the skin temperature and thermal comfort perception decreased (all P<0.05), except in the supraclavicular skin temperature, which did not change (P>0.05). Furthermore, the superficial muscle activation increased at the shivering threshold. It is noteworthy that the largest physiological changes occurred during the first 30 minutes of cold exposure, when the participants felt less discomfort.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30859179>Pentraxin 3 deficiency protects from the metabolic inflammation associated to diet-induced obesity.</a></h2><p>Low-grade chronic inflammation characterizes obesity and metabolic syndrome. Here, we aim at investigating the impact of the acute-phase protein long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) on the immune-inflammatory response occurring during diet-induced obesity.PTX3 deficiency in mice fed a high- diet for 20 weeks protects from weight gain and adipose tissue deposition in visceral and subcutaneous depots. This effect is not related to changes in glucose homeostasis and  but is associated with an improved immune cell phenotype in the adipose tissue of Ptx3 deficient animals, which is characterized by -macrophages polarization and increased angiogenesis. These findings are recapitulated in humans where carriers of a PTX3 haplotype (PTX3 h2/h2 haplotype), resulting in lower PTX3 plasma levels, presented with a reduced prevalence of obesity and decreased abdominal adiposity compared with non-carriers.Our results support a critical role for PTX3 in the onset of obesity by promoting inflammation and limiting adipose tissue vascularization and delineate PTX3 targeting as a valuable strategy for the treatment of adipose tissue-associated inflammatory response.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that low proliferative potential of adipose derived stromal cells (ADSC) associates with reduced formation of new  depots, excess accumulation of  in the functional adipocytes and their hypertrophy, resulting in  inflammation and insulin resistance.We screened two groups of obese patients with or without T2DM, matched for BMI, age, and duration of obesity to test the hypothesis that hypertrophy and decreased renewal of adipocytes may underlie transition from obesity to T2DM. All patients were matched for carbohydrate  (fasting blood glucose level, glycated hemoglobin, HOMA-IR index and M-index). The subcutaneous and omental  tissue biopsies were obtained during bariatric surgery from obese individuals with or without T2DM. The morphology and immunophenotype of subcutaneous and omental  was assessed in frozen tissue sections. ADSC were isolated from both types of  tissue biopsies and screened for morphology, proliferative potential and inflammatory status.The non-diabetic patients had normal carbohydrate  and moderate insulin resistance measured by HOMA-IR and hyperinsulinemic clamp (M-index), while T2DM patients were extremely insulin resistant by both indexes. The average size of diabetic adipocytes was higher than that of non-diabetic in both subcutaneous and omental  tissues, indicating adipocyte hypertrophy in T2DM. Both these tissues contained higher level of macrophage infiltration and increased M1-like to -like ratio of macrophage subpopulations, suggesting increased  inflammation in T2DM. This was confirmed by increased activatory phosphorylation of stress-induced JNK1/2 in diabetic ADSC.These results suggest that blunted proliferation and increased hypertrophy of diabetic ADSC may lead to reduced insulin sensitivity via increased inflammation mediated by M1 macrophages and JNK1/2 pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Adipose tissue (AT) plays a crucial role in the development of obesity, promoting the infiltration and accumulation of leukocytes in the tissue and sustaining adipocyte expansion. Anthocyanins exert a broad range of health benefits, but their effect in improving obesity-related inflammation in vivo has been poorly characterized. We examined the effects of a purple corn cob extract in the context of AT inflammation in a murine diet-induced obesity (DIO) model.Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to control diet (CTR + HO), high  diet (HF + HO) or high  diet plus purple corn extract (HF + RED) for 12 weeks. Blood glucose, AT, and liver gene expression, , biochemistry, and histology were analysed and flow cytometry was performed on AT leukocytes and Kupffer cells.RED extract intake resulted in lower MCP-1 mediated recruitment and proliferation of macrophages into crown-like structures in the AT. AT macrophages (ATM) of HF + RED group upregulated  markers (ArgI, Fizz1, TGFβ), downregulating inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, COX-2) thanks to the suppression of NF-kB signalling. ATM also increased the expression of iron -related genes (FABP4, Hmox1, Ferroportin, CD163, TfR1, Ceruloplasmin, FtL1, FtH1) associated with a reduction in iron storage and increased turnover. ATM from HF + RED mice did not respond to LPS treatment ex vivo, confirming the long-lasting effects of the treatment on  polarization. Adipocytes of HF + RED group improved  and displayed a lower inflammation grade. Liver histology revealed a remarkable reduction of steatosis in the HF + RED group, and Kupffer cell profiling displayed a marked switch towards the  phenotype.RED extract attenuated AT inflammation in vivo, with a long-lasting reprogramming of ATM and adipocyte profiles towards the anti-inflammatory phenotype, therefore representing a valuable supplement in the context of obesity-associated disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555815>Sleep duration and quality are not associated with brown adipose tissue volume or activity-as determined by 18F-FDG uptake, in young, sedentary adults.</a></h2><p>Short sleep duration and sleep disturbances have been related to obesity and metabolic disruption. However, the behavioral and physiological mechanisms linking sleep and alterations in energy balance and  are incompletely understood. In rodents, sleep regulation is closely related to appropriate brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic activity, but whether the same is true in humans has remained unknown. The present work examines whether sleep duration and quality are related to BAT volume and activity (measured by 18F-FDG) and BAT radiodensity in humans.A total of 118 healthy adults (69% women, 21.9 ± 2.2 years, body mass index: 24.9 ± 4.7 kg/) participated in this cross-sectional study. Sleep duration and other sleep variables were measured using a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven consecutive days for 24 hours per day. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess sleep quality. All participants then underwent a personalized cold exposure to determine their BAT volume, activity, and radiodensity (a proxy of the intracellular triglyceride content), using static positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CI) scan.Neither sleep duration nor quality was associated with BAT volume or activity (the latter represented by the mean and peak standardized 18F-FDG uptake values) or radiodensity (all p > .1). The lack of association remained after adjusting the analyses for sex, date of PET/CT, and body composition.Although experiments in rodent models indicate a strong relationship to exist between sleep regulation and BAT function, it seems that sleep duration and quality may not be directly related to the BAT variables examined in the present work.

In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high- diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the , we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host  by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to  pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with probiotics. Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of oleic acid, which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose  of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3), a serine/threonine kinase, has been reported to participate in various cellular processes. We sought to examine the potential mechanism by which GSK3, a serine/threonine kinase implicated in various cellular processes, modulates obesity-induced visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammation. Approach and Results- Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high- diet for 10 weeks while being treated with vehicle control or GSK3 inhibitors SB216763 or CHIR99021. RNA-sequencing results using VAT demonstrated that GSK3 inhibitor treatment reversed obesity-specific expression of genes associated with inflammation. Consistently, GSK3 inhibition reduced obesity-induced VAT inflammation as characterized by decreased proinflammatory M1 macrophages but increased anti-inflammatory  macrophages in the VAT and reduced circulatory inflammatory monocytes. These anti-inflammatory effects of GSK3 inhibition were found to be driven, at least in part, by inhibiting production of apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage in macrophages via inactivating STAT3 to reduce free fatty acid and chemokine level produced from VAT to suppress the migration/chemotaxis of macrophages and monocytes. Conclusions- Our findings suggest that GSK3 may act as an important regulator of obesity-induced inflammation and characterize the novel role of GSK3 in shifting macrophage polarization and reinforce its therapeutic potential for obesity-induced inflammation and its associated diabetes mellitus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29587266>Overexpression of PTPN2 in Visceral Adipose Tissue Ameliorated Atherosclerosis via T Cells Polarization Shift in Diabetic Apoe-/- Mice.</a></h2><p>Dysregulated inflammation in adipose tissue, marked by increased pro-inflammatory T-cell accumulation and reduced regulatory T cells (Treg), contributes to diabetes-associated insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying T-cell-mediated inflammation in adipose tissue remain largely unknown.Sixty apolipoprotein E (ApoE-/-) mice were randomly divided into chow and diabetes groups. Diabetes was induced by a high- and high-sugar diet combined with low-dose streptozotocin. Then we transferred a recombinant adenovirus carrying the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) gene into epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) of ApoE-/- mice. After transfection, all mice were euthanized to evaluate the effects of PTPN2 on T cells polarization and atherosclerosis.PTPN2 was downregulated in EWAT of diabetic ApoE-/- mice. PTPN2 overexpression in EWAT reversed the high Th1/Treg and Th17/Treg ratios in EWAT of diabetic mice. In addition, PTPN2 overexpression in EWAT could significantly reduce macrophages infiltration, the ratio of M1/ macrophages and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in EWAT, improving insulin resistance. In aortic root lesions, the vulnerability index were significantly decreased by overexpression of PTPN2 in EWAT.These data suggested that PTPN2 overexpression in EWAT would inhibit systemic inflammation and increase the plaque stability via T cells polarization shift in diabetic mice.© 2018 The Author(s).

Hence, this study aimed at overweight adolescent boys to explore the effect of high intensity intermittent training (HIIT) on these anti-inflammatory cytokines and body composition parameters. Materials and methods Twenty overweight adolescent boys [aged: 18.0 ± 1.5 years, weight: 81.8 ± 4.3 kg, body mass index (BMI): 27.6 ± 0.8 kg/] completed this study. The subjects were randomly assigned into two groups of control (CG, n = 10) and training (TG, n = 10). Subjects in the TG performed their training sessions 3 days/week for 6 weeks. The baseline serum values of IL-4 and IL-13 and anthropometric features were measured 1 day before the beginning of exercise intervention and 1 day after the last training session in a fasting state. Results Six weeks of HIIT significantly increased the baseline serum levels of IL-4 (p = 0.022) and IL-13 (p = 0.014) in overweight adolescent boys. In addition, body weight (BW), BMI and body  percent (BF%) were reduced in response to HIIT. Moreover, significantly negative correlations were found between changes of IL-4 and IL-13 with changes of BW, BMI and BF%. Conclusions HIIT seems to be an appropriate exercise modality for overweight adolescent boys to induce an anti-inflammatory cytokine response and, to improve body composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29599925>A porcine placental extract prevents steatohepatitis by suppressing activation of macrophages and stellate cells in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is caused by ectopic  accumulation in the liver. NAFLD is associated with hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, resulting in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with advanced fibrosis. Placental extracts have been used to treat various chronic diseases due to their antioxidative effect. However, the effects of the extracts on the development of NASH have yet to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that supplementation with an oral porcine placental extract (PPE) attenuated  accumulation and peroxidation, insulin resistance, inflammatory and stress signaling, and fibrogenesis in the liver of NASH model mice fed a high-cholesterol and high- diet. The PPE reduced the number of M1-like liver macrophages, but increased the number of anti-inflammatory -like macrophages, resulting in a predominance of  over M1 macrophage populations in the liver of NASH mice. Accordingly, the PPE suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced M1 polarization in isolated murine peritoneal macrophages, whereas it facilitated interleukin 4-induced  polarization. Furthermore, the PPE reduced the hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation associated with the attenuated transforming growth factor-β/Smad3 signaling, both in the liver of NASH mice and in RI-T cells, a HSC line. The PPE may be a potential approach to prevent NASH by limiting  peroxidation, promoting  macrophage polarization, and attenuating HSC activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475655>Molecular adaptation in adipose tissue in response to overfeeding with a high- diet under sedentary conditions in South Asian and Caucasian men.</a></h2><p>For the same BMI, South Asians have a higher body  percentage than Caucasians. There might be differences in the fatty acid (FA) handling in adipose tissue when both ethnicities are exposed to high- overfeeding. The objective of the present study was to investigate the molecular adaptation in relation to FA  in response to overfeeding with a high- diet (OHFD) in South Asian and Caucasian men. Ten South Asian men (BMI 18-29 kg/) and ten Caucasian men (BMI 22-33 kg/), matched for body  percentage, aged 20-40 years were included. A weight-maintenance diet (30 % , 55 % carbohydrate and 15 % protein) was given for 3 d followed by 3 d of overfeeding (150 % energy requirement) with a high- diet (60 % , 25 % carbohydrate and 15 % protein) while staying in a respiration chamber. Before and after overfeeding, abdominal subcutaneous  biopsies were taken. Proteins were isolated, analysed and quantified for short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH), carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1α (CPT1a), adipose TAG lipase, perilipin A (PLINA), perilipin B, lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid binding protein 4 using Western blotting. OHFD decreased the HADH level (P < 0·05) in Caucasians more than in Asians (P < 0·05), but the baseline and after intervention HADH level was relatively higher in Caucasians. The level of CPT1a decreased in South Asians and increased in Caucasians (P < 0·05). PLINA did not change with diet but the level was higher in South Asians (P < 0·05). The observed differences in HADH and PLINA levels as well as in CPT1a response may be important for differences in the long-term regulation of energy ()  in these populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261035>Oxidative stress and the altered reaction to it in Fabry disease: A possible target for cardiovascular-renal remodeling?</a></h2><p>Fabry disease is characterized by deficient expression/activity of α-GalA with consequent lysosomal accumulation in various organs of its substrate Gb3. Despite enzyme replacement therapy, Fabry disease progresses with serious myocardial, cerebral and renal manifestations. Gb3 accumulation may induce oxidative stress (OxSt), production of inflammatory cytokines and reduction of nitric oxide, which may impact on Fabry disease's clinical manifestations.OxSt status was characterized in 10 patients compared with 10 healthy subjects via protein expression of p22phox, subunit of NADH/NADPH oxidase, (Western blot), Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 levels (ELISA), antioxidant/anti-inflammatory,  peroxidation as malondialdehyde (MDA) production (colorimetric assay), phosphorylation state of Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase (ERK)1/2 and Myosin Phosphatase Target Protein (MYPT)-1 (Western blot), marker of Rho kinase activation, both involved in OxSt signaling. Cardiac left ventricular (LV) mass was also evaluated (M-mode echocardiography).LV mass was higher in Fabry's males (123.72±2.03SEM g/) and females (132.09±6.72g/). p22phox expression was also higher in patients (1.04±0.09 d.u. vs 0.54±0.05 d.u. p<0.01) as well as MDA levels (54.51±3.97 vs 30.05±7.11 nmol/mL p = 0.01) while HO-1 was reduced (8.84±0.79 vs 14.03±1.23 ng/mL, p<0.02). MYPT-1's phosphorylation was increased in patients (0.52±0.11 d.u. vs 0.03±0.08 d.u., p<0.01) while phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was reduced (0.91±0.08 d.u. vs 1.53±0.17 d.u., p = 0.004).This study documents OxSt activation and the altered reaction to it in Fabry patients. Cardiac remodeling, Rho kinase signaling activation and reduction of protective HO-1 might suggest that, in addition to enzyme replacement therapy, OxSt inhibition by either pharmacological or nutritional measures, is likely to prove useful for the prevention/treatment of Fabry patients' cardiovascular-renal remodeling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30539788>Macrophage Raptor Deficiency-Induced Lysosome Dysfunction Exacerbates Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an increasingly prevalent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and hepatocellular damage. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) has been investigated extensively in the context of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of mTORC1 in NASH remains largely unknown.mTORC1 activity in macrophages in human mild and severe NASH liver was compared. Mice with macrophage-specific deletion of the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) subunit and littermate controls were fed a high-fructose, palmitate, and cholesterol diet for 24 weeks or a methionine- and choline-deficient diet for 4 weeks to develop NASH.We report that in human beings bearing NASH, macrophage mTORC1 activity was lower in livers experiencing severe vs mild NASH liver. Moreover, macrophage mTORC1 disruption exacerbated the inflammatory response in 2 diet-induced NASH mouse models. Mechanistically, in response to apoptotic hepatocytes (AHs), macrophage polarization toward a  anti-inflammatory phenotype was inhibited in Raptor-deficient macrophages. During the digestion of AHs, macrophage mTORC1 was activated and coupled with dynamin-related protein 1 to facilitate the latter's phosphorylation, leading to mitochondrial fission-mediated calcium release. Ionomycin or A23187, calcium ionophores, prevented Raptor deficiency-mediated failure of lysosome acidification and subsequent lipolysis. Blocking dynamin-related protein 1-dependent mitochondria fission impaired lysosome function, resulting in reduced production of anti-inflammatory factors such as interleukins 10 and 13.Persistent mTORC1 deficiency in macrophages contributes to the progression of NASH by causing lysosome dysfunction and subsequently attenuating anti-inflammatory -like response in macrophages during clearance of AHs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

APOL1 is a minor protein component of HDL, as well as being expressed in podocytes and vascular cells. Reverse cholesterol transport involves the transport of cholesterol to HDL by cellular ATP-binding cassette; ABCA1 and ABCG1 with subsequent delivery from peripheral tissues to the liver. With impaired reverse cholesterol transport, lipid accumulation occurs and macrophages morphologically transform into foam cells, releasing inflammatory factors. We asked whether the APOL1 risk variants alter peripheral cholesterol  and specifically affect macrophage cholesterol efflux. Tissues and bone marrow (BM)-derived monocytes were isolated from wild-type mice (WT) and from BAC/APOL1 transgenic (APOL1-G0, APOL1-G1, and APOL1-G2) mice, which carry a bacterial artificial chromosome that contains the human APOL1 genomic region. Monocytes were differentiated into macrophages using M-CSF, and then polarized into M1 and  macrophages. Cholesterol content, cholesterol efflux, and ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA expression were measured. Kidney, spleen, and bone marrow-derived macrophages from APOL1-G1 and -G2 mice showed increased cholesterol accumulation and decreased ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA levels. BM-derived macrophages from APOL1-G1 and -G2 mice showed significantly reduced cholesterol efflux compared to WT or APOL1-G0 macrophages. Taken together, the evidence suggests that APOL1-G1 and -G2 risk variants impaired reverse cholesterol transport through decreased expression of cholesterol efflux transporters suggesting a possible mechanism to promote macrophage foam cell formation, driving inflammation in the glomerulus and renal interstitium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29530973>The consequences of seasonal fasting during the dormancy of tegu lizards () on their postprandial metabolic response.</a></h2><p>Tegu lizards () aestivate for up to 5 months during Brazil's winter, when they retreat to burrows and halt most activities. Dormant tegus reduce their gastrointestinal (GI) mass, which allows a substantial energy economy. This strategy, however, implies that the first post-dormancy digestion would be more costly than subsequent feeding episodes as a result of GI atrophy. To address this, we determined the postprandial metabolic response (SDA) of the first (M1), second () and several (RM) feeding episodes after tegus' dormancy. Another group of tegus (PF) was subjected to an extra 50 day fasting period after arousal. Glucose, triglycerides and uric acid levels were checked before and after feeding. M1 digestion lasted twice as long and cost twofold more when compared with  or RM, in agreement with the idea that GI atrophy inflates digestion cost at the first post-dormancy meal. The SDA response was similar in  and RM, suggesting that the GI tract was fully reorganized after the first feeding. The SDA cost was equal in PF and RM, implying that the change in state per se (dormant to arousal) triggers the regrowth of GI, independently of feeding. Fasting tegus at M1 presented higher triglyceride and lower uric acid levels than fed tegus, indicating that fasting is mainly sustained by  storage. Our results show that seasonal fasting imposes an extra digestion cost to tegus following their next feeding, which is fully paid during their first digestion. This surplus cost, however, is negligible compared with the overall energetic savings from GI tract atrophy during the dormancy period.© 2018.

Eight healthy volunteers, 5 premenopausal women and 3 men ages 23-54 y with body mass index (BMI; kg/) 18-27, underwent 2 separate study visits with a ≥2-wk washout period. The first morning of each visit volunteers consumed a standardized breakfast (14.5% protein, 27.5% , 60% carbohydrate, and 1.5 kcal/mL) containing [14C]tripalmitin and [3H]triolein with 2 g of α-CD or placebo, followed by 2 g of α-CD or placebo per meal for 2 more days. Volunteers consumed 100 g/d of dietary . Feces were collected for 72 h after the labeled breakfast to measure radiotracer content and total fecal . Radiotracer appearance in plasma TGs was measured at intervals after the labeled meal as a secondary outcome.Virtually no 3H radiotracer, but an average of ∼20% of the 14C radiotracer was recovered in fecal lipids, with no difference between α-CD and placebo. Total fecal  content and radiotracer appearance in postprandial plasma TGs did not differ between the α-CD and placebo treatments. Plasma appearance of 14C-TG was 37% ± 14% less (P < 0.0001) than 3H-TG.α-CD supplementation did not increase loss of dietary  in stool or total fecal  compared with placebo in healthy adults.

On overnight experimental visits, participants performed full-body resistance exercise (RE; 65% 1RM) and were randomly assigned to consume either daytime PRO (PRO, 30 g casein) 30 min post-RE and presleep (30 min before bed) noncaloric, sensory-matched placebo (PLA, 0 g casein) (PRO-PLA), or the opposite (PLA-PRO), switching the order of the supplements on the following visit. SCAAT lipolysis, resting  (indirect calorimetry), and plasma biomarkers (glucose, insulin, nonesterified fatty acids, glycerol) were measured at baseline, overnight, and the next morning.There were no differences in overnight SCAAT lipolysis between conditions indicated by interstitial glycerol concentrations (PRO-PLA: baseline, 669 ± 137; next morning, 321 ± 77.1; PLA-PRO: baseline, 524 ± 109; next morning, 333 ± 68.0 μM),  oxidation (PRO-PLA: baseline, 5.70 ± 0.35; next morning, 5.00 ± 0.28; PLA-PRO: baseline, 6.59 ± 0.32; next morning, 5.44 ± 0.27 g/min), or any other measure.There was no difference between the effects of daytime and presleep PRO supplementation on SCAAT lipolysis or whole-body substrate utilization in resistance-trained women.

However, the role of 12/15LOX in post-myocardial infarction (MI) left ventricular remodeling is unclear. To determine the role of 12/15LOX, 8-12 week-old C57BL/6 J wild-type (WT; n = 93) and 12/15LOX (n = 97) mice were subjected to permanent coronary artery ligation and monitored at day (d)1 and d5 post-operatively. Post-MI d28 survival was measured in male and female mice. No-MI surgery mice were maintained as d0 naïve controls. 12/15LOX mice exhibited higher survival rates with lower cardiac rupture and improved LV function as compared with WT post-MI. Compared to WT, neutrophils and macrophages in 12/15LOX mice were polarized towards N2 and  phenotypes, respectively, with increased of expression mrc-1, ym-1, and arg-1 post-MI. 12/15LOX mice exhibited lower levels of pro-inflammatory 12-(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE) and higher CYP2J-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) levels. CYP2J-derived 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EETs activated macrophage-specific hemeoxygenase (HO)-1 marked with increases in F4/80/Ly6C and F4/80/CD206 cells at d5 post-MI in 12/15LOX mice. In contrast, inhibition of HO-1 led to total mortality in 12/15LOX mice by post-MI d5. 12/15LOX mice exhibited reduced collagen density and lower α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression at d5 post-MI, indicating delayed or limited fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation. In conclusion, genetic deletion of 12/15LOX reduces 12(S)-HETE and activates CYP2J-derived EETs to promote effective resolution of inflammation post-MI leading to reduced cardiac rupture, improved LV function, and better survival.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing evidence indicates that low-grade inflammation plays a pivotal role in the onset and progression of OA. In this review, we summarize emerging findings on the pathological roles of synovial macrophages, adipose tissue macrophages, and osteoclasts in OA and their potential clinical implications from cell biology to preclinical and preliminary clinical trials. The failure of synovial macrophages to transition from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory  subtypes may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of synovitis in OA. M1 macrophages promote the inflammatory microenvironment and progression of OA through interactions with synovial fibroblasts and chondrocytes, thus increasing the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases. Direct inhibition of M1 or promotion of  polarization may be useful therapeutic interventions. Adipose tissue macrophages present in the infrapatella  pad (IPFP) were involved in the progression of obesity-induced OA, which contributed to changes in the integrity of the IPFP. Furthermore, macrophages and osteoclasts in the subchondral bone were involved in bone remodeling and pain through uncoupled osteoclast/osteoblast activity and increased nociceptive signaling. Growing evidence has indicated an important role for macrophage-mediated low-grade inflammation in OA. Fully understanding the link between macrophages and other cells in joints will provide new insights into OA disease modification.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The classically activated M1 macrophages are key players in the initiation and maintenance of adipose tissue (AT) inflammation. The role of NFATc3 in obesity and AT inflammation is unknown. We set out to determine how deficiency of NFATc3 effected macrophage polarization, inflammation and insulin resistance in visceral AT of high- diet (HFD)-fed mice. Nfatc3−/− and WT mice were fed a HFD for 8–17 weeks. Epididymal white AT (eWAT) F4/80(+) cells were characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and quantitative RT-PCR. Results showed that Nfatc3−/− mice developed HFD-induced obesity similar to WT mice, but insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were improved, and liver  accumulation was reduced in Nfatc3−/− mice compared to WT control mice. Moreover, M1 macrophage content and proinflammatory factors were reduced, whereas the alternatively activated  macrophage content was increased in eWAT of HFD-fed Nfatc3−/− mice compared to that of WT mice. In addition, eWAT insulin signaling was improved in HFD-fed Nfatc3−/− mice. Importantly, after bone-marrow-derived macrophages had been isolated from Nfatc3−/− mice and cultured in vitro, treatment of these cells with interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide resulted in reduction of M1 inflammatory markers, suggesting that NFATc3 promoted M1 polarization by a cell-autonomous mechanism. The results demonstrated that NFATc3 played an important role in M1 macrophage polarization, AT inflammation and insulin resistance in response to obesity through transcriptional activation of proinflammatory genes.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30382157>A reduced M1-like/-like ratio of macrophages in healthy adipose tissue expansion during SGLT2 inhibition.</a></h2><p>The adipose tissue includes various stromal cells, such as preadipocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells, which are involved in adipose tissue functions. We previously reported that, in obese mice, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor ipragliflozin (Ipra) promoted the expansion of the epididymal adipose tissue (Epi) with increase of serum ketone body concentration. The Ipra-induced adipose tissue expansion did not deteriorate adipose inflammation, or systemic glucose/, referred to as "healthy adipose tissue expansion." Here we found that Ipra promoted healthy adipose tissue expansion with a reduced ratio of pro-inflammatory M1-like adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) to anti-inflammatory -like ATMs. Ipra downregulated the gene expression of interleukin (IL)-15 (Il15) in stromal cells of Epi. IL-15 inhibited lipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells associated with downregulation of the lipogenic gene. Ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate suppressed Il15 gene induction in M1-polarized cultured macrophages, and a ketogenic diet reproduced the adipose tissue expansion without deteriorating systemic glucose  in mice. Our data indicate that the phenotypic switch of ATMs could mediate healthy adipose tissue expansion by treatment with Ipra, and it may offer new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of adipose tissue expansion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208190>Dudleya brittonii extract promotes survival rate and -like metabolic change in porcine 3D4/31 alveolar macrophages.</a></h2><p>Although alveolar macrophages play a key role in the respiratory immunity of livestock, but studies on the mechanism of differentiation and survival of alveolar macrophages are lacking.

The cells were activated by exposure to Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate (PMA). D. Brittonii extraction was performed with distilled water. For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) and propidium iodide (PI). Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular  accumulation with Oil Red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death were induced by PMA treatment, and exposure to DB reduced the PMA induced downregulation of cell survival. PMA and DB treatments upregulated the  accumulation, with corresponding increase in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA), fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNA expressions.

Insulin sensitivity,  concentrations,  particle size and other cardiometabolic variables were measured at baseline and follow-up. Participants were categorized by whether they achieved at least modest weight loss (≥ 3%) or not (<3%) following the intervention.A greater improvement in insulin sensitivity was observed in adults performing exercise training with at least modest weight loss (2.2 mU·l-1 ·min -1, CI: 1.5 to 2.8) compared to those who did not (0.8 mU·l-1 ·min -1, CI: 0.5 to 1.2). Similar results were observed for acute insulin response, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol concentration, low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size and high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle size (p<0.05), when all exercise groups were combined. No significant results across weight loss categories were observed for LDL, HDL, glucose, or insulin levels.The present study suggests that aerobic exercise combined with at least modest weight loss leads to greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, triglycerides as well as other non-traditional  risk factors (non-HDL cholesterol, HDL/LDL particle size).

We infected high  diet (HFD)-induced obese mice with the intestinal nematode parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus and observed that helminth infection resulted in significantly attenuated obesity. Attenuated obesity corresponded with marked upregulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a key protein involved in energy expenditure, in adipose tissue, suppression of glucose and triglyceride levels, and alteration in the expression of key genes involved in . Moreover, the attenuated obesity in infected mice was associated with enhanced helminth-induced Th2/Treg responses and  macrophage polarization. Adoptive transfer of helminth-stimulated  cells to mice that were not infected with H. polygyrus resulted in a significant amelioration of HFD-induced obesity and increased adipose tissue browning. Thus, our results provide evidence that the helminth-dependent protection against obesity involves the induction of  macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30657952>Changes in Lean Mass, Absolute and Relative Muscle Strength, and Physical Performance After Gastric Bypass Surgery.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery results in reduced muscle mass as weight is lost, but postoperative changes in muscle strength and performance are incompletely understood.To examine changes in body composition, strength, physical activity, and physical performance following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).In a prospective cohort of 47 adults (37 women, 10 men) aged 45 ± 12 years (mean ± SD) with body mass index (BMI) 44 ± 8 kg/, we measured body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, handgrip strength, physical activity, and physical performance (chair stand time, gait speed, 400-m walk time) before and 6 and 12 months after RYGB. Relative strength was calculated as absolute handgrip strength/BMI and as absolute strength/appendicular lean mass (ALM).Participants experienced substantial 12-month decreases in weight (-37 ± 10 kg or 30% ± 7%),  mass (-48% ± 12%), and total lean mass (-13% ± 6%). Mean absolute strength declined by 9% ± 17% (P < 0.01). In contrast, relative strength increased by 32% ± 25% (strength/BMI) and 9% ± 20% (strength/ALM) (P < 0.01 for both). There were clinically significant postoperative improvements in all physical performance measures, including mean improvement in gait speed of >0.1 m/s (P < 0.01) and decrease in 400-m walk time of nearly a full minute.In the setting of dramatic weight loss, lean mass and absolute grip strength declined after RYGB. However, relative muscle strength and physical function improved meaningfully and are thus noteworthy positive outcomes of gastric bypass.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668793>Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in the Green Microalga Lobosphaera incisa Contribute to Tolerance to Abiotic Stresses.</a></h2><p>Lobosphaera incisa is a green microalga that accumulates high levels of the valuable omega-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4n-6) in triacylglycerols (TAG) under nitrogen (N) starvation. LC-PUFA accumulation is a rare trait in photosynthetic microalgae with insufficiently understood physiological significance. In this study, RNAi was attempted, for the first time in L. incisa, to produce knockdown lines for the Δ5 desaturase gene. Two lines, termed modified lines, which were isolated during screening for transgenic events, demonstrated alterations in their LC-PUFA profile, ARA-biosynthesis gene expression and  class distribution. In line M5-78, which appeared to carry a mutation in the Δ6 elongase gene, LC-PUFA were substituted by 18:3n-6 in all glycerolipids. Line -35, for which the exact genetic background has not been established, displayed a dramatic reduction in 20:4n-6, concomitant with an augmented proportion of 18:1n-9, in particular in the extraplastidial membrane lipids and TAG. The physiological responses of the modified lines to stressful conditions were compared with the wild type and the Δ5 desaturase mutant. In the N-replete cells of modified lines, the frequency of  droplets was reduced, while a number of starch grains increased, suggesting altered partitioning of assimilated carbon into reserve products. Furthermore, both lines exhibited reduced ability to accumulate TAG under N deprivation and recover from N starvation. Both lines demonstrated lower photosynthetic pigment contents, impairments in photosynthesis under a range of stressful conditions, and less efficient functioning of photoprotection under optimal conditions. Possible implications of fatty acids modifications in the stress response of L. incisa are addressed.ï¿½ The Author(s) 2019.

Risk for NASH was defined as the presence of one or more of the following biochemical and metabolic parameters (BMPs): fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dl, triglycerides (TG) ≥150 mg/dl, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) ≥2.5, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >54 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >42 IU/L. Body mass index measurement and nutritional assessment were performed by standard procedures. Liver fibrosis stage was determined by liver stiffness measurement using transitional elastography (TE) or by liver biopsy (LB).Risk for NASH was 57% (290/505). Most BMPs values incremented by BMI category. Among 171 at-risk patients, 106 subjects were evaluated by TE and 65 subjects by LB. Abnormal liver stiffness (≥6.0 kPa) was prevalent in 54% (57/106) of the cases, whereas by LB, 91% (59/65) of patients with obesity had NASH and liver fibrosis. Furthermore, liver fibrosis was prevalent in 46% (6/13) in normal weight individuals, whereas 4.6% (3/65) of patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/ showed no histopathological abnormalities. Overall, 67.8% (116/171) of the patients had abnormal liver stiffness or NASH. The normal weight patients with liver damage consumed relatively a higher -rich diet compared to the other groups whereas the remaining subgroups shared a similar dietary pattern.Young patients with overweight and obesity showed a high prevalence of altered BMPs related to abnormal liver stiffness assessed by TE and NASH by LB. Early diagnostic strategies are required to detect the risk for NASH and avoid further liver damage in populations with a rising prevalence of obesity by defining the risk factors involved in the onset and progression of NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30401004>24-h severe energy restriction impairs postprandial glycaemic control in young, lean males.</a></h2><p>Intermittent energy restriction (IER) involves short periods of severe energy restriction interspersed with periods of adequate energy intake, and can induce weight loss. Insulin sensitivity is impaired by short-term, complete energy restriction, but the effects of IER are not well known. In randomised order, fourteen lean men (age: 25 (sd 4) years; BMI: 24 (sd 2) kg/; body : 17 (4) %) consumed 24-h diets providing 100 % (10 441 (sd 812) kJ; energy balance (EB)) or 25 % (2622 (sd 204) kJ; energy restriction (ER)) of estimated energy requirements, followed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 75 g of glucose drink) after fasting overnight. Plasma/serum glucose, insulin, NEFA, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) were assessed before and after (0 h) each 24-h dietary intervention, and throughout the 2-h OGTT. Homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) assessed the fasted response and incremental AUC (iAUC) or total AUC (tAUC) were calculated during the OGTT. At 0 h, HOMA2-IR was 23 % lower after ER compared with EB (P<0·05). During the OGTT, serum glucose iAUC (P<0·001), serum insulin iAUC (P<0·05) and plasma NEFA tAUC (P<0·01) were greater during ER, but GLP-1 (P=0·161), GIP (P=0·473) and FGF21 (P=0·497) tAUC were similar between trials. These results demonstrate that severe energy restriction acutely impairs postprandial glycaemic control in lean men, despite reducing HOMA2-IR. Chronic intervention studies are required to elucidate the long-term effects of IER on indices of insulin sensitivity, particularly in the absence of weight loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30375290>A diet high in sugar-sweetened beverage and low in fruits and vegetables is associated with adiposity and a pro-inflammatory adipokine profile.</a></h2><p>Diet, obesity and adipokines play important roles in diabetes and CVD; yet, limited studies have assessed the relationship between diet and multiple adipokines. This cross-sectional study assessed associations between diet, adiposity and adipokines in Mexican Americans. The cohort included 1128 participants (age 34·7±8·2 years, BMI 29·5±5·9 kg/, 73·2 % female). Dietary intake was assessed by 12-month food frequency questionnaire. Adiposity was measured by BMI, total percentage body  and percentage trunk  using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Adiponectin, apelin, C-reactive protein (CRP), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-IV), IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-18, leptin, lipocalin, monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP-1), resistin, secreted frizzled protein 4 (SFRP-4), SFRP-5, TNF-α and visfatin were assayed with multiplex kits or ELISA. Joint multivariate associations between diet, adiposity and adipokines were analysed using canonical correlations adjusted for age, sex, energy intake and kinship. The median (interquartile range) energy intake was 9514 (7314, 11912) kJ/d. Overall, 55 % of total intake was accounted for by carbohydrates (24 % from sugar). A total of 66 % of the shared variation between diet and adiposity, and 34 % of diet and adipokines were explained by the top canonical correlation. The diet component was most represented by sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), fruit and vegetables. Participants consuming a diet high in SSB and low in fruits and vegetables had higher adiposity, CRP, leptin, and MCP-1, but lower SFRP-5 than participants with high fruit and vegetable and low SSB intake. In Mexican Americans, diets high in SSB but low in fruits and vegetables contribute to adiposity and a pro-inflammatory adipokine profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29617391>Biliopancreatic Diversion is associated with greater increases in energy expenditure than Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.</a></h2><p>The greater weight loss achieved following Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPDS) versus Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) has been attributed to the malabsorptive effects of BPDS. Increased weight loss after BPDS could also be underpinned by larger increases in energy expenditure. Hypothetically, the more radical reconfiguration of the small intestine in BPDS could result in an accentuated increase in meal associated thermogenesis (MAT).Female subjects (baseline mean age 40 years, mean BMI-55kg/) were assessed four years after randomization to BPDS (n = 6) or RYGB (n = 6). Energy expenditure (EE) and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured by indirect calorimetry over 24 hours. A detailed protocol allowed for discrimination of basal metabolic rate (BMR), fasting EE and MAT as components of total energy expenditure (TEE) normalised for total and lean tissue by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.Median weight loss at follow-up was 1.5-fold higher following BPDS relative to RYGB, resulting in respective median BMIs of 29.5 kg/ (21.7 to 36.7) after BPDS and 37.8 kg/ (34.1 to 45.7) after RYGB (p = 0.015). The BPDS group had a lower :lean ratio compared to the RYGB group (p = 0.009). Overall 24-hour TEE adjusted for total tissue was higher in the BPDS group, as were BMR, fasting EE and MAT (all p<0.05). Differences between RYGB and BPDS in BMR and TEE were nullified when normalised for lean mass. Postprandial RQ increased significantly but to a similar extent in both groups.Enhanced and prolonged MAT and lower :lean mass ratios after BPDS may explain relative increases in total energy expenditure as compared to RYGB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036059>Acyl Glucuronide Metabolites of 6-Chloro-5-[4-(1-hydroxycyclobutyl)phenyl]-1 H-indole-3-carboxylic Acid (PF-06409577) and Related Indole-3-carboxylic Acid Derivatives are Direct Activators of Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK).</a></h2><p>Studies on indole-3-carboxylic acid derivatives as direct activators of human adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α1β1γ1 isoform have culminated in the identification of PF-06409577 (1), PF-06885249 (2), and PF-06679142 (3) as potential clinical candidates.

Herein, we describe the biosynthetic preparation, purification, and structural characterization of the glucuronide conjugates of 1-3. Spectral characterization of the purified glucuronides M1, , and M3 indicated that they were acyl glucuronide derivatives. In vitro pharmacological evaluation revealed that all three acyl glucuronides retained selective activation of β1-containing AMPK isoforms.

FGF21 is highly expressed in liver while FGF21 receptors (Beta-klotho (KLB) and FGFR1c) are highly expressed in white adipose tissues (WAT). Plasma FGF21 has been shown to be increased after 7-10 days of fasting but oppositely plasma FGF21 is also increased in obesity. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of 60 hours of fasting on plasma FGF21 levels in obese and lean subjects and to determine the gene expression of KLB and FGFR1c in the subcutaneous WAT before, during and after 60 hours of fasting. Eight obese (BMI>30 kg/) and seven lean subjects (BMI<25 kg/) were fasted for 60 hours and blood samples were taken at time 0 and after 12, 36 and 60 hours of fasting. A biopsy from the subcutaneous WAT was taken at time 0, 12 and 60 hours of fasting. FGF21 was measured in plasma by an ELISA and mRNA expression of KLB and FGFR1cC was measured in WAT by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The fast significantly decreased plasma FGF21 in obese subjects while no change in plasma FGF21 was observed in lean subjects. Interestingly, KLB was significantly decreased in WAT in response to fasting in both lean and obese subjects indicating a potential important adaptive regulation of KLB in response to fasting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29969718>IRE1α aggravates ischemia reperfusion injury of fatty liver by regulating phenotypic transformation of kupffer cells.</a></h2><p>Fatty liver is one of the widely accepted marginal donor for liver transplantation, but is also more sensitive to ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) and produces more reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, so far, no effective method has been developed to alleviate it. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER-stress) of hepatocyte is associated with the occurrence of fatty liver disease, but ER-stress of kupffer cells (KCs) in fatty liver is not clear at all. This study evaluates whether ER-stress of KCs is activated in fatty liver and accelerate IRI of fatty livers. ER-stress of KCs was activated in fatty liver, especially the IRE1α signal pathway. KCs with activated ER-stress secreted more proinflammatory cytokine to induce its M1-phenotypic shift in fatty liver, resulting in more severe IRI. Also, activated ER-stress of BMDMs in vitro by tunicamycin can induce its pro-inflammatory shift and can be reduced by 4-PBA, an ER-stress inhibitor. Knockdown of IRE1α could regulate the STAT1 and STAT6 pathway of macrophage to inhibit the M1-type polarization and promote -phenotypic shift. Furthermore, transfusion of IRE1α-knockdown KCs significantly reduced the liver IRI as well as the ROS of HFD feeding mice. Altogether, these data demonstrated that IRE1α of KCs may be a potential target to reduce the fatty liver associated IRI in liver transplantation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

It worsens  induced inflammation and insulin resistance. Here we demonstrate that a small molecule, a peroxyvanadate compound i.e. DmpzH [VO(O) (dmpz)] or dmp, could robustly decrease macrophage infiltration, accumulation and their polarization in high  diet (HFD) induced obese diabetic mice. In searching the underlying mechanism it was revealed that SIRT1 level was strikingly low in the inflamed adipose tissue of HFD mice as compared to mice fed with standard diet (SD). Administration of dmp markedly increased SIRT1 level by inducing its gene expression with a consequent decrease in macrophage population. Elevation of SIRT1 coincided with the decrease of MCP1, Fetuin-A (FetA) and IFNγ. Since MCP1 and FetA drive macrophage to inflamed adipose tissue and IFNγ promotes  to M1 transformation, both recruitment and M1 induced inflammation were found to be significantly repressed by dmp. In addressing the question about how dmp induced excess SIRT1 could reduce MCP1, FetA and IFNγ levels, we found that it was due to the inactivation of NFκB because of its deacetylation by SIRT1. Since NFκB is the transcriptional regulator of these molecules, their expressions were significantly suppressed and that caused sharp decline in macrophage recruitment and their polarity to M1. This effected a marked fall in proinflammatory cytokine level which significantly improved insulin sensitivity. dmp is likely to be the first molecule that rescues inflammatory burden contributed by macrophage in obese diabetic mice adipose tissue which causes significant increase in insulin sensitivity therefore it may be a meaningful choice to treat type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Soluble CD14 levels in knee OA synovial fluids are associated with symptoms and progression of disease. Here we investigate the role of this receptor in development of OA using a murine joint injury model of disease.10-week-old Male C57BL/6 (WT) and CD14-deficient (CD14-/-) mice underwent destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery to induce OA. Joint histopathology was used to examine cartilage damage, and microCT to evaluate subchondral bone (SCB) remodeling at 6 and 19 weeks after surgery. Synovial and  pad expression of macrophage markers (F4/80, CD11c, CD68, iNOS, CCR7, CD163 and CD206) was assessed by flow cytometry and droplet digital (dd)PCR. Changes in locomotive activity indicative of joint pain were evaluated longitudinally up to 16 weeks by automated behavioral analysis.Early cartilage damage scores 6 weeks post-DMM were similar in both strains (Mean score ±SEM WT: 4.667±1.38, CD14-/-: 4.6±0.6), but at 19 weeks were less severe in CD14-/- (6.0±0.46) than in WT mice (13.44±2.5, p = 0.0002). CD14-/- mice were protected from both age-related and post-surgical changes in SCB mineral density and trabecular thickness. In addition, CD14-/- mice were protected from decreases in climbing activity (p = 0.015 vs. WT, 8 weeks) observed after DMM. Changes in synovial/ pad expression of CCR7, a marker of M1 macrophages, were slightly reduced post-DMM in the absence of CD14, while expression of CD68 (pan-macrophage marker) and CD163 ( marker) were unchanged.CD14 plays an important role in progression of structural and functional features of OA in the DMM model, and may provide a new target for therapeutic development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30060948>Saxagliptin regulates M1/ macrophage polarization via CaMKKβ/AMPK pathway to attenuate NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a hepatic manifestation of metabolic disease, is an important complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). Inflammation plays a crucial role in the development and progression of NAFLD. Moreover, the pathological formation of NAFLD is closely related to accumulation and polarization of hepatic macrophages. Saxagliptin, a newly antidiabetic agent, can suppress hepatic inflammation reportedly. However, underlying mechanisms remain poorly explored. In this study, we showed saxagliptin alleviated  accumulation and attenuated liver inflammation with downregulation of inflammation factors in diabetic rats. Moreover, saxagliptin could reduce the phenotype of M1 macrophage iNOS and increase the phenotype of  macrophage CD206. We also found saxagliptin increased CaMKKβ/AMPK activation. In vitro, human THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into M1/ macrophages by LPS/IL-4. We clarified saxagliptin's anti-inflammatory effect by reducing NF-κB, TNF-α expression and promoting  macrophage polarization. Furthermore, we demonstrated CaMKKβ-dependent AMPK activation was involved in macrophage polarization. In conclude, our results detected saxagliptin could attenuated inflammation through regulation of M1/ macrophage polarization and might be via CaMKKβ/AMPK pathway.Copyright © 2018.

These properties tip the balance of macrophage polarization, which is an essential process in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pravastatin on atherosclerosis of the aorta in apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE-KO) mice without high  feeding. Methods Six 8-week-old apoE-KO male mice were randomly divided into two groups: a control group and a pravastatin (40 mg·kg·day)-treated group. At 35 weeks, the mice were sacrificed and the size of plaques on the aorta was assessed by Oil Red O staining. M1 and  macrophages were identified by inducible nitric oxide synthase and arginase-I, respectively, using immunohistochemistry. Results Pravastatin increased the size of atherosclerotic plaques in apoE-KO mice without high  feeding. The ratio of M1/ macrophages increased in atherosclerotic plaques, which might slow the process of atherosclerosis, while blood cholesterol levels were elevated. Conclusion Our study suggests that pravastatin polarizes the phenotype of macrophages toward  in atherosclerotic lesions, despite an increase in serum cholesterol levels in ApoE-KO mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30010698>Effect of 12 wk of resistant starch supplementation on cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with prediabetes: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Type 2 resistant starch (RS2) has been shown to improve glycemic control and some cardiovascular endpoints in rodent and human studies.The aim of this study was to perform one of the first randomized clinical trials in adults with prediabetes and one of the longest trials to test whether RS2 can improve cardiometabolic health.68 overweight [body mass index (BMI) ≥27 kg/] adults aged 35-75 y with prediabetes were randomized to consume 45 g/d of high-amylose maize (RS2) or an isocaloric amount of the rapidly digestible starch amylopectin (control) for 12 wk. At baseline and postintervention, ectopic  depots (visceral adipose tissue, intrahepatic lipids, and intramyocellular lipids) were measured by magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy, energy  by respiratory chamber, and carbohydrate  by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), an intravenous glucose tolerance test, and a meal tolerance test. Cardiovascular risk factors-serum lipids, blood pressure, heart rate, and inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α)-were also measured. The primary endpoints were insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, ectopic , and markers of inflammation. Data were primarily analyzed as treatment effects via a linear mixed model both with and without the addition of covariates.Relative to the control group, RS2 lowered HbA1c by a clinically insignificant 0.1 ± 0.2% (Δ = -1 ± 2 mmol/mol; P = 0.05) but did not affect insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, the disposition index, or glucose or insulin areas under the curve relative to baseline (P ≥ 0.23).

The control group consisted of 17 conditionally healthy donors without obesity (BMI=18.9-24.9 kg/), seven of them formed a comparison group that was included to compare the results of study on the levels of tissue-specific expression of HSP70 mRNA. The study of mRNA expression was performed by real-time PCR. The concentration of IL-6 and TNF-a was measured in blood serum by the ELISA method. In patients with obesity with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), a significant increase in the serum level of proinflammatory cytokines was found in comparison with the group of patients without DM2 and control. The results of histological examination of liver biopsy specimens in obese patients revealed the most pronounced changes in the group of DM2 patients. Regardless of the stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in obese DM2 patients, an increase in the area of fatty inclusions (relative to the group without type 2 diabetes) was recorded. The study of the HSP70 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells allowed its significant increase relative to the comparison group. The relationship between the level of expression of the HSP70 gene in metabolically active tissues (visceral, subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver) established in all obese patients with the serum content of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-a) may indicate suppression of HSP70 expression in these tissues, background of systemic and local inflammation in obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216384>Autologous transplantation of photoactivated subcutaneous adipose tissue improves glucose homeostasis in high- diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence indicates that normal adipose tissue transplantation improves whole-body energy  and glucose homeostasis in a high- diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model. Adipose tissue macrophages are associated with glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and obesity in humans, offering a potential target for therapeutics. However, whether transplantation of autologous adipose tissue that changes the macrophage phenotype directly contributes to systemic glucose intolerance has not been determined. We specifically developed our device, with more refined wavelengths of light to activate the macrophage phenotype in isolated subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) from host HFD mice. Autologous transplantation of photoactivated sWAT into HFD mice significantly reverses the M1 macrophage phenotype into , reduces the infiltration of macrophages in adipose tissues of HFD mice, and decreases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Strikingly, this transplantation reduced blood glucose levels and caused significant improvement in glucose tolerance, which was not shown in sham-operated or nonphotoactivated sWAT-transplanted HFD mice. Moreover, positron emission/computed tomography scans indicated higher glucose uptake in the heart but not in the liver, hindlimb muscles, or abdominal sWAT. These data suggested that the ability of photoactivation to shift Adipose tissue macrophage polarization in HFD mice caused a significant improvement in glucose homeostasis and that autologous transplantation might be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of diabetes.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30859801>Co-culture of Platelets with Monocytes Induced  Macrophage Polarization and Formation of Foam Cells: Shedding Light on the Crucial Role of Platelets in Monocyte Differentiation</a></h2><p>Far beyond hemostasis and thrombosis, significant evidence has indicated the critical role of platelets in atherosclerosis. SDF-1 is among the pro-inflammatory chemokines that are increased in platelets of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The goal of the current work is to identify the in vitro effect of platelets from either CAD patients or healthy volunteers on the induction of macrophages and foam cells.The expression of SDF-1 on platelet surfaces in CAD patients and healthy volunteers was investigated using flow cytometry. We also evaluated the CXCR4/CXCR7 expression on monocytes from buffy coats of healthy volunteers.

Flow cytometry and real-time PCR were also employed to evaluate surface markers and mRNA expression of genes involved in this process after co-culture of platelets with monocytes.Monocytes in co-culture with platelets acquired a spindleshape appearance and ORO-positive  droplets. In addition, platelets could induce CD163 expression, as an important marker of  macrophage, and upregulate the mRNA expression of the , and  genes in monocytes.

Conversely, in GLIC variants exhibiting net PFL potentiation, the cavity was persistently expanded and proximal to . Mutations designed to favor this deepened site enabled sensitivity even to subclinical concentrations of PFL, and a uniquely prolonged mode of potentiation evident up to ∼30 min after washout. Dependence of these prolonged effects on exposure time implicated the membrane as a reservoir for a -accessible binding site. However, at the highest measured concentrations, potentiation appeared to be masked by an acute inhibitory effect, consistent with the presence of a discrete, water-accessible site of inhibition. These results support a multisite model of transmembrane allosteric modulation, including a possible link between - and receptor-based theories that could inform the development of new anesthetics.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

During two meal challenge test visits subjects received standardized isocaloric (450 kcal) liquid meals: high-carbohydrate (HC, carbohydrates: 89% of energy) and normo-carbohydrate (NC, carbohydrates: 45% of energy). Fasting (0 min) and postprandial (30, 60, 120, 180 min) plasma samples were analyzed for metabolite profiles through untargeted metabolomics.  fingerprinting was performed on an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system connected to an iFunnel quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer.In HR-genotype men, after the intake of an HC-meal, we noted a significantly lower area under the curves (AUCs) of postprandial plasma concentrations of most of the phospholipids (-37% to -53%, variable importance in the projection (VIP) = 1.2-1.5), lysophospholipids (-29% to -86%, VIP = 1.1-2.6), sphingolipids (-32% to -47%, VIP = 1.1-1.3), as well as arachidonic (-36%, VIP = 1.4) and oleic (-63%, VIP = 1.3) acids, their metabolites: keto- and hydoxy-fatty acids (-38% to -78%, VIP = 1.3-2.5), leukotrienes (-65% to -83%, VIP = 1.4-2.2), uric acid (-59%, VIP = 1.5), and pyroglutamic acid (-65%, VIP = 1.8). The AUCs of postprandial sphingosine concentrations were higher (125-832%, VIP = 1.9-3.2) after the NC-meal, AUCs of acylcarnitines were lower (-21% to -61%, VIP = 1.1-2.4), and AUCs of fatty acid amides were higher (51-508%, VIP = 1.7-3.1) after the intake of both meals.In nondiabetic men carrying the TCF7L2 HR genotype, subtle but detectable modifications in intermediate lipid  are induced by an HC-meal.
