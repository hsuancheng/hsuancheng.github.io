The aim of the present study is based on a component resolved diagnosis (CRD) model approach to investigate the mite specific IgE sensitization profile to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Blomia tropicalis and the performance outcomes of commercially available CRDin subjects with severe allergic rhinitis (SAR).We selected 63 consecutive patients showing a dual sensitization to D. pteronyssinus and . tropicalis with persistent severe rhinitis according to the ARIA Guidelines. Skin pricktest with standardized extracts and specific serum IgE to both mites along with serum specific IgE to Der p 1, Der p 2, Der p 23, Der p 10 and Blo t 5 was measured.Fifty-eight and 59 patients showed a positive sIgE to the whole extracts of D. pteronyssinus and . tropicalis, respectively. While 91.67% of patients were sensitized to specific IgE Der p 1, Der p 2 and/or Der p 23, specific IgE to Blo t 5 (≥0.3 ISU-E) was not detected in the majority (55%) of the serum samples.Although the combination panel of the commercially available major allergens Der p 1, Der p 2 and Der p 23, identified more than 90% of the D. pteronyssinus allergic patients, Blo t 5 showed a very limited performance in those sensitized to . tropicalis. Improvements in CRD and further research concerning the prevalence and clinical relevance of serodominant allergens are needed to achieve a genuine molecular diagnosis along with a patient-centred mite-allergy specific .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628053>Butyrophilin-like 3 Directly Binds a Human Vγ4 T Cell Receptor Using a Modality Distinct from Clonally-Restricted Antigen.</a></h2><p>Butyrophilin (BTN) and butyrophilin-like (BTNL/Btnl) heteromers are major regulators of human and mouse γδ T cell subsets, but considerable contention surrounds whether they represent direct γδ T cell receptor (TCR) ligands. We demonstrate that the BTNL3 IgV domain binds directly and specifically to a human Vγ4 TCR, "LES" with an affinity (∼15-25 μM) comparable to many αβ TCR-peptide major histocompatibility complex interactions. Mutations in germline-encoded Vγ4 CDR2 and HV4 loops, but not in somatically recombined CDR3 loops, drastically diminished binding and T cell responsiveness to BTNL3-BTNL8-expressing cells. Conversely, CDR3γ and CDR3δ loops mediated LES TCR binding to endothelial protein C receptor, a clonally restricted autoantigen, with minimal CDR1, CDR2, or HV4 contributions. Thus, the γδ TCR can employ two discrete binding modalities: a non-clonotypic, superantigen-like interaction mediating subset-specific regulation by BTNL/BTN molecules and CDR3-dependent, antibody-like interactions mediating adaptive γδ T cell biology. How these findings might broadly apply to γδ T cell regulation is also examined.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

They have emerged as effective therapy in patients with multiple relapsed/refractory disease, capable of sustaining durable remissions. Two CAR-T cell products (axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel) are currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. A third anti CD19 CAR-T cell, lisocabtagene ciloleucel is currently being evaluated in large clinical trials and may also be United States Food and Drug Administration-approved soon. CAR-T cell-related toxicities, including infections, cytokine release syndrome, and neurotoxicity are potential complications of therapy. With increasing use of CAR-T cells, the mechanism of toxicities and mitigation strategies needs to be developed. Additionally, reasons for CAR-T cell failure and progression following this therapy needs to be further studied. We describe the recent developments in this field, with emphasis on the complications of therapy and factors contributing to toxicities, efficacy, and resistance. We also describe the ongoing research in this field and the newer CAR-T cell constructs that are being developed to counter the challenges that have been identified in this field.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This was followed by major advances in passive  75 years ago (production of pooled human IgG for subcutaneous injection) and 50 years ago (widespread technology for producing immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration). More than 200 tons of pooled human IgG are produced per year worldwide. The preparation is used primarily for IgG substitution in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, as well as for an immunomodulating treatment of a growing number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These preparations contain the pooled IgG antibody repertoire of a large population of healthy plasma donors. This repertoire includes antibodies that neutralize pathogens and their factors of virulence, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and antibodies to other foreign and own proteins, as well as to carbohydrate antigens. Naturally polyspecific antibodies that are present in all healthy individuals play an important role as a first-line defense against bacteria and viruses. After exposure to protein-modifying agents, some IgG molecules can acquire the ability to bind novel structurally unrelated antigens. This phenomenon is referred to as induced polyspecificity. The list of these protein-modifying molecules was shown to include low-pH buffers, free heme, pro-oxidative ferrous ions, reactive oxygen species, etc. Such modified antibody preparations may have a therapeutic potential, since their administration to animals with experimental sepsis or aseptic systemic response syndromes significantly improved survival rates, while the same dose of the native preparation had no effect. We also hypothesize that the aggressive protein-modifying molecules released in sites of inflammation and tissue damage could also modify the antigen-binding behavior of surface immunoglobulin  cell receptors and the structurally related T cell receptors. This "specificity editing" of both types of receptors may play a major role in the body's defense mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593325>Recent developments and highlights in food allergy.</a></h2><p>The achievement of long-lasting, safe treatments for food allergy is dependent on the understanding of the immunological basis of food allergy. Accurate diagnosis is essential for management. In recent years, data from oral food challenges have revealed that routine allergy testing is poor at predicting clinical allergy for tree nuts, almonds in particular. More advanced antigen-based tests including component-resolved diagnostics and epitope reactivity may lead to more accurate diagnosis and selection of therapeutic intervention. Additional diagnostic accuracy may come from cellular tests such as the basophil activation test or mast cell approaches. In the context of clinical trials, cellular tests have revealed specific T-cell and -cell populations that are more abundant in food-allergic individuals with distinct mechanistic features. Awareness of clinical markers, such as the ability to eat baked forms of milk and egg, continues to inform the understanding of natural tolerance development. Mouse models have allowed for investigation into multiple mechanisms of food allergy including modification of epithelial metabolism, and the induction of regulatory cell subsets and the microbiome. Increasing numbers of children who underwent food  enlarged the body of evidence on mechanisms and predictors of treatment success. Experimental immunological markers in conjunction with clinical determinants such as lower age and lower initial specific IgE appear to be of benefit. More research on the optimal dose, preparation, and route of application integrating a high-level safety and efficacy is demanded. Alternatively, biologics blocking TSLP, IL-33, IL-4 and IL-13, or IgE may help to achieve that.© 2019 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Other polymers such as fluorinated ethylene propylene are increasingly being implemented in the design of closed cell culture vessels, for example to facilitate the production of cells for cancer . Cultured cells are sensitive to culture vessel material changes through different mechanisms including cell-surface interactions, which are in turn dependent on the amount, type, and conformation of proteins adsorbed on the surface. Here, we investigate the protein deposition from cell culture medium onto untreated polystyrene and fluoropolymer surfaces using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring and atomic force microscopy. Both of these non-polar surfaces showed comparable protein deposition kinetics and resulted in similar mechanical and topographical film properties. At protein concentrations found in typical serum-free media used to culture dendritic cells, two deposition phases can be observed. The protein layers form within the first few minutes of contact with the cell culture medium and likely consist almost exclusively of albumin. It is indicated that initial protein film formation will be completed prior to cell settling and initial cell contact will be established with the secondary protein layer. The structural properties of the protein film surface will strongly depend on the albumin concentration in the medium and presumably be less affected by the chemical composition of the cell culture surface.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Cytosolic DNA triggers immune responses by activating the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. The binding of DNA to cGAS activates its enzymatic activity, leading to the synthesis of a second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (2'3'-cGAMP). This cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) activates STING, which in turn activates the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ), promoting the transcription of genes encoding type I interferons and other cytokines and mediators that stimulate a broader immune response. Exogenous 2'3'-cGAMP produced by malignant cells and other CDNs, including those produced by bacteria and synthetic CDNs used in cancer , must traverse the cell membrane to activate STING in target cells. How these charged CDNs pass through the lipid bilayer is unknown. Here we used a genome-wide CRISPR-interference screen to identify the reduced folate carrier SLC19A1, a folate-organic phosphate antiporter, as the major transporter of CDNs. Depleting SLC19A1 in human cells inhibits CDN uptake and functional responses, and overexpressing SLC19A1 increases both uptake and functional responses. In human cell lines and primary cells ex vivo, CDN uptake is inhibited by folates as well as two medications approved for treatment of inflammatory diseases, sulfasalazine and the antifolate methotrexate. The identification of SLC19A1 as the major transporter of CDNs into cells has implications for the immunotherapeutic treatment of cancer, host responsiveness to CDN-producing pathogenic microorganisms and-potentially-for some inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651383>How Should We Determine the Value of CAR T-Cell Therapy?</a></h2><p>In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies for patients with relapsed or refractory -cell leukemia and selected -cell lymphomas.

Inhibiting the immune checkpoint through naturalizing programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is proved to be a successful therapeutic regime for lymphoma. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are unceasingly reported to be promising biological targets for the cancer therapies. This study planned to explore the regulation of small nucleolar RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14) on DLBCL. SNHG14 level in DLBCL samples and cell lines was analyzed by GEPIA bioinformatics tool and RT-qPCR. Biological functions of SNHG14 in DLBCL were detected by CCK-8, colony formation, and transwell invasion assays. Molecular interaction was determined by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and luciferase reporter assays. MiR-5590-3p-related pathway was identified through KEGG pathway analysis applying DAVID6.8 online bioinformatics tool. Effect of SNHG14 on CD8+ T cells was detected by flow cytometry. Results depicted that SNHG14 was upregulated in DLBCL and its depletion retarded proliferation, migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, SNHG14 sponged miR-5590-3p to upregulate Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), and ZEB1 transcriptionally activated SNHG14 and PD-L1 to promote the immune evasion of DLBCL cells. In conclusion, we firstly showed that SNHG14/miR-5590-3p/ZEB1 positive feedback loop promoted diffuse large  cell lymphoma progression and immune evasion through regulating PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint, indicating that targeting SNHG14 was a potential approach to improve the efficacy of  in DLBCL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484074>A Gorilla Adenovirus-Based Vaccine against Zika Virus Induces Durable Immunity and Confers Protection in Pregnancy.</a></h2><p>The teratogenic potential of Zika virus (ZIKV) has made the development of an effective vaccine a global health priority. Here, we generate two gorilla adenovirus-based ZIKV vaccines that encode for pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins (GAd-Zvp) or prM and the ectodomain of E protein (GAd-Eecto). Both vaccines induce humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and prevent lethality after ZIKV challenge in mice. Protection is antibody dependent, CD8 T cell independent, and for GAd-Eecto requires the complement component C1q. Immunization of GAd-Zvp induces antibodies against a key neutralizing epitope on domain III of E protein and confers durable protection as evidenced by memory  and long-lived plasma cell responses and challenge studies 9 months later. In two models of ZIKV infection during pregnancy, GAd-Zvp prevents maternal-to-fetal transmission. The gorilla adenovirus-based vaccine platform encoding full-length prM and E genes is a promising candidate for preventing congenital ZIKV syndrome and possibly infection by other flaviviruses.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Standard CNI-based mTOR-free immunosuppression (group A, n=264) was compared to a 50 % reduction of CNI and introduction of the mTOR inhibitor Sirolimus within 4 to 6 weeks after LT (group , n=261).Median MELD at LT was low with 10 (7 - 15) (group A) and 11 (8 - 15) (group ) in the intention-to-treat approach. CNI dose and CNI trough were reduced by 20% and 8% (group A) versus 55% and 56% (group ) at 3 months post transplantation. Renal function was preserved at 3 months after LT in the Sirolimus arm [eGFR 74 (57-95) versus 67 (55-85) ml/min/1.73m, p=0.004] but was similarly impaired thereafter compared to group A. The per protocol analysis identified LT recipients in group  with concomitant early CNI minimization and Sirolimus treatment ≥ year 1 with significantly superior eGFR and lowest rate of chronic kidney disease (≥ stage 3) from year 1 onwards until study end. Competing risk factors for renal disease (arterial hypertension, fat metabolism disorder and hyperglycemia) were not associated with worse kidney function.Prevention of CNI nephrotoxicity by Sirolimus-based early CNI minimization protects renal function only short-term after LT in the intention-to-treat analysis of this low MELD cohort. Yet, selected LT recipients compliant with early CNI minimization and Sirolimus maintenance achieved better long-term renal outcomes compared to real-world practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561563>An Antibody Specific for the Dog Leukocyte Antigen DR (DLA-DR) and Its Novel Methotrexate Conjugate Inhibit the Growth of Canine  Cell Lymphoma.</a></h2><p>Canine -cell lymphoma (CBL) is an incurable, spontaneous lymphoid malignancy constituting an accurate animal model for testing novel therapeutic strategies in human medicine. Resources of available species-specific therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting CBL are scarce. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of mAb B5, specific for the dog leukocyte antigen DR (DLA-DR) and its antibody-drug conjugate with methotrexate (B5-MTX). B5 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of DLA-DR-expressing canine  cell lymphoma/CLBL1 and CLB70 leukemia lines, but not the GL-1 line not expressing DLA-DR. The cytotoxicity of B5-MTX to sensitive cells was further potentiated by a payload of MTX, but without any substantial off-target effects. The infusion of B5 and B5-MTX in a murine model of disseminated, advanced canine lymphoma, mediated >80% and >90% improvement in survival, respectively, and was well tolerated by the animals. Interestingly, the concentrations of soluble DLA-DR (sDLA-DR) antigens present in the blood serum of tumor-bearing mice were found proportional to the tumor burden. On this basis, sDLA-DR levels were evaluated as a potential biomarker using samples from canine lymphoma patients. In summary, the action of B5 and B5-MTX holds promise for further development as an alternative/complementary option for the diagnosis and treatment of canine lymphoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573749>Review of emerging biomarkers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in the era of  and targeted therapy.</a></h2><p>Biomarkers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) emerge rapidly in recent years, especially for new targeted therapies and immunotherapies.Recent, relevant peer-reviewed evidence were critically reviewed and summarized.This review article briefly introduces essential biomarker concepts, including purposes and classifications (predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic markers), and the phases of biomarker development.

The consequences of chronic HBV infection include progressive liver damage, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although current direct antiviral therapies successfully lead to suppression of viral replication and deceleration of liver cirrhosis progression, these treatments are rarely curative and patients often require a life-long therapy. Based on the ability of the immune system to control HBV infection in at least a subset of patients, immunotherapeutic approaches are promising treatment options to achieve HBV cure. In particular, T cell-based therapies are of special interest since CD8 T cells are not only capable to control HBV infection but also to eliminate HBV-infected cells. However, recent data show that the molecular mechanisms underlying CD8 T-cell failure in chronic HBV infection depend on the targeted antigen and thus different strategies to improve the HBV-specific CD8 T-cell response are required.

CLR is characterized by peritumoral lymphocytic aggregates that are found at the advancing edge of the tumor. Spatial and molecular characterization of CLR within the tumor microenvironment (TME) have uncovered a spectrum of peritumoral lymphoid aggregates with varying levels of organization and maturation. In early stages of CLR development, CD4+ T-cells cluster predominantly with mature antigen presenting dendritic cells. As CLR matures, increasing numbers of -cells, as well as follicular dendritic cells are recruited to create lymphoid follicles. When highly organized, CLR resembles functional tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), allowing for lymphocyte recruitment to the TME and promoting a tumor-specific adaptive immune response. CLR has been consistently associated with favorable prognostic factors and improved survival among CRC patients, often providing more prognostic information than current clinical staging systems. However, consensus is lacking regarding CLR scoring and it is not clinically assessed or reported. Differences between CLR and other cancer-associated lymphoid structures exist both in primary and metastatic disease, underscoring the need to characterize organ-specific TLS. Further research is needed to explore the role of CLR in predicting response to  and to leverage CLR to promote immunotherapeutic strategies in CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498528>Entecavir resistance mutations rtL180M/T184L/M204V combined with rtA200V lead to tenofovir resistance.</a></h2><p>Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) imposes a high genetic barrier to drug resistance and potently inhibits replication of multidrug-resistant hepatitis  virus. Few clinical cases with confirmed TDF-resistance have been reported to date.Here, we report viral rebound in a patient with chronic hepatitis  who underwent TDF monotherapy and harboured a quadruple mutant consisting of classic entecavir (ETV)-resistance mutations (rtL180M/T184L/M204V) together with an rtA200V mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene. Sequencing analysis revealed that this quadruple mutant emerged as a major viral population. In vitro phenotyping demonstrated that the rtL180M/T184L/A200V/M204V mutant had moderate resistance to TDF treatment, with a 4.52-fold higher half maximal effective concentration than that of wild-type virus. Importantly, this patient with TDF resistance achieved virological suppression after TDF/ETV combination rescue therapy.An rtL180M/T184L/A200V/M204V mutant with moderate resistance to TDF monotherapy was selected during sequential nucleoside analogue (NA) treatment in a stepwise manner.

The expression of programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1), B7-1, B7-2, human leukocyte antigen-ABC (HLA-ABC), and herpesvirus-entry mediator (HVEM) ligands was determined on leukemia blasts.PD1 expression on αβ and γδ T-cells was significantly higher in patients with ALL than in those with AML (p=0.0019 and 0.0239, respectively). CTLA-4 expression was moderately higher on αβ and γδ T-cells in ALL (p=0.077 and 0.077, respectively), whereas HLA-ABC expression was significantly higher in AML blast cells (p=0.0182). The expression of CTLA-4 on γδ T-cells and the B7-2 ligand on blasts was higher in patients with high-risk ALL (p=0.02 and 0.02, respectively). In AML, PD1 expression on αβ T-cells was higher in the intermediate-risk group (p=0.05), whereas HVEM expression was significantly higher in the low-risk group (p=0.02). Expression of CTLA-4 on γδ+ T-cells and PD-L1 on blasts were both associated with poor relapse-free survival outcomes in ALL (p=0.049).The higher expression of immune checkpoint molecules, in particular, CTLA-4 and PD-L1 are associated with a poorer prognosis in ALL, suggesting that selective use of the immune checkpoint blockade might improve the clinical outcomes in patients with ALL.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

The recent discovery that radiotherapy can have anti-cancer effects on the immune system has led to recognition of its ability to sensitize the tumor microenvironment to . However, radiation can also prompt adverse immunosuppressive effects that block aspects of systemic response at other tumor sites. Our hypothesis was that inhibition of the MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK) in combination with anti-programmed cell death-1 (α-PD1) checkpoint blockade will enhance immune-mediated responses to radiotherapy.We tested the efficacy of this triple therapy (Radiation + α-PD1 + α-MerTK mAbs) in 129Sv/Ev mice with bilateral lung adenocarcinoma xenografts. Primary tumors were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (36 Gy in three 12-Gy fractions), and tumors were monitored for response.The triple therapy significantly delayed abscopal tumor growth, improved survival rates, and reduced numbers of lung metastases. We further found that the triple therapy increased the activated CD8 and NK cells populations measured by granzyme  expression with upregulation of CD8CD103 tissue-resident memory cells (T) within the abscopal tumor microenvironment relative to radiation only.The addition of α-PD1 + α-MerTK mAbs to radiotherapy could alter the cell death to be more immunogenic and generate adaptive immune response via increasing the retention of T cells in the tumor islets of the abscopal tumors which was proven to play a major role in survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506076>IFN-gamma-induced PD-L1 expression in melanoma depends on p53 expression.</a></h2><p>Immune checkpoint inhibition and in particular anti-PD-1  have revolutionized the treatment of advanced melanoma. In this regard, higher tumoral PD-L1 protein (gene name: CD274) expression is associated with better clinical response and increased survival to anti-PD-1 therapy. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that tumor suppressor proteins are involved in immune regulation and are capable of modulating the expression of immune checkpoint proteins. Here, we determined the role of p53 protein (gene name: TP53) in the regulation of PD-L1 expression in melanoma.We analyzed publicly available mRNA and protein expression data from the cancer genome/proteome atlas and performed immunohistochemistry on tumors with known TP53 status. Constitutive and IFN-ɣ-induced PD-L1 expression upon p53 knockdown in wildtype, TP53-mutated or JAK2-overexpressing melanoma cells or in cells, in which p53 was rendered transcriptionally inactive by CRISPR/Cas9, was determined by immunoblot or flow cytometry. Similarly, PD-L1 expression was investigated after overexpression of a transcriptionally-impaired p53 (L22Q, W23S) in TP53-wt or a TP53-knockout melanoma cell line. Immunoblot was applied to analyze the IFN-ɣ signaling pathway.For TP53-mutated tumors, an increased CD274 mRNA expression and a higher frequency of PD-L1 positivity was observed. Interestingly, positive correlations of IFNG mRNA and PD-L1 protein in both TP53-wt and -mutated samples and of p53 and PD-L1 protein suggest a non-transcriptional mode of action of p53. Indeed, cell line experiments revealed a diminished IFN-ɣ-induced PD-L1 expression upon p53 knockdown in both wildtype and TP53-mutated melanoma cells, which was not the case when p53 wildtype protein was rendered transcriptionally inactive or by ectopic expression of p53, a transcriptionally-impaired variant, in TP53-wt cells. Accordingly, expression of p53 in a TP53-knockout melanoma cell line boosted IFN-ɣ-induced PD-L1 expression. The impaired PD-L1-inducibility after p53 knockdown was associated with a reduced JAK2 expression in the cells and was almost abrogated by JAK2 overexpression.While having only a small impact on basal PD-L1 expression, both wildtype and mutated p53 play an important positive role for IFN-ɣ-induced PD-L1 expression in melanoma cells by supporting JAK2 expression. Future studies should address, whether p53 expression levels might influence response to anti-PD-1 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522661>Influenza epidemiology in patients admitted to sentinel Australian hospitals in 2017: the Influenza Complications Alert Network (FluCAN).</a></h2><p>The Influenza Complications Alert Network (FluCAN) is a sentinel-hospital-based surveillance program that operates at sites in all jurisdictions in Australia.

Of these, 52% were elderly (≥65 years), 14% were children (<16 years), 6.5% were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, 1.6% were pregnant and 78% had chronic comorbidities. A significant proportion were due to influenza  (31%). Estimated vaccine coverage was 72% in the elderly (≥65 years), 50% in non-elderly adults with medical comorbidities and 24% in children (<16 years) with medical comorbidities. The estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the target population was 23% (95% CI: 7%, 36%).

However, treatment effectiveness for patients with relapsed/refractory -cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been less satisfactory compared with patients with -cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The present study described a case of refractory follicular lymphoma. A high expression of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) was measured on CD3 T cells (80.90%) in peripheral blood samples obtained from the patient enrolled in this study, indicating that treatment with autologous CAR-T 19 cell therapy may not be successful. Therefore, a therapy regimen consisting of CAR-T 19 cells in combination with a reduced dose of nivolumab (1.5 mg/kg) for PD-1 blockade was used. A low dose of PD-1 blockade therapy was used to reduce the adverse effects associated with the combination of a PD-1 inhibitor and CAR-T 19 cells. This salvage therapy resulted in remission that lasted for >10 months.Copyright: © Wang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586302>Clinicians' Perspectives on Cure in Adult Patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with Minimal Residual Disease: A Delphi Study.</a></h2><p>Hematologic complete remission (CR) is achievable for most adults with  cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). However, minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with hematologic CR is associated with increased risk of relapse, shorter survival, and poorer transplantation outcomes. This study explored the concept of cure in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) BCP-ALL by MRD status at first hematologic CR (CR1) to inform evaluation of the clinical and economic benefits of new agents, where the concept of cure is important but long-term data are not available. The study used modified Delphi methodology involving clinicians experienced in the treatment of adult ALL. Participants completed a questionnaire, which was followed by country-specific panel discussions to discuss results and identify consensus on concepts and definitions. Clinicians from France (n = 4), Germany (n = 4), and the UK (n = 5) took part. Participants described cure in terms of the probability of future relapse. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was the preferred outcome measure to describe cure for the three patient groups considered (patients with MRD at CR1; patients who become negative for MRD after further treatment; patients who continue to have MRD). Consensus was reached on definitions of cure: that cure would begin to be considered at 3 years' RFS and/or would be highly likely at 5 years' RFS. Participants agreed that patients with MRD should usually undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to have the best chance of survival; consensus was reached that alternatives are required when transplantation is not an option. Panels agreed that patients who achieve cure have a higher mortality rate and lower health-related quality of life than the general population. This study provides quantitative and qualitative information on the concept of cure in Ph- BCP-ALL in CR by MRD status applicable to interpreting the value of new therapies.Funding: Amgen.Plain Language Summary: Plain language summary available for this article.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513709>Development of an Adrenocortical Cancer Humanized Mouse Model to Characterize Anti-PD1 Effects on Tumor Microenvironment.</a></h2><p>While the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has transformed treatment strategies of several human malignancies, research models to study  in ACC are lacking.To explore the effect of anti-PD1  on the alteration of the immune milieu in ACC in a newly generated preclinical model and correlate with the response of the matched patient.To characterize the CU-ACC2-M2B patient-derived xenograft in a humanized mouse model, evaluate the effect of a PD-1 inhibitor therapy and compare to the CU-ACC2 patient with metastatic disease.Characterization of the CU-ACC2-hu-CB-BRGS model confirmed ACC origin and match with the original human tumor.

One of the reasons for this trend is their many off-label uses. Up to one third of all prescriptions are for non-indicated use, which in addition to drug repurposing includes different dosing or duration than those recommended. In this review, we elaborate on what antidepressants can treat besides depression. The five classes of drugs for depression are introduced, and their mechanisms of action and serious side effects are described. The most common off-label uses of antidepressants are discussed, with a special focus on treating eating disorders, sleep problems, smoking cessation and managing chronic pain. Depression is often a comorbidity when antidepressants are chosen as therapy, but good therapeutic effects have been observed for other conditions also when depression is not involved. Finally, a new type of antidepressant developed from the hallucinogenic "party drug" ketamine is briefly introduced. This recent development suggests that antidepressants will keep playing a central role in medicine for years to come.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier .V.

In this review, we provide an overview of the practical aspects of a chimeric antigen T cell receptor (CAR-T) program development and the steps necessary for its successful implementation.CAR-T therapy is a complex process and poses significant challenges as institutions prepare to deliver this therapy as a standard of care for the eligible patients. It requires a rigorous infrastructure with specific clinical, administrative, and regulatory demands. Institutions that led the clinical trials for CAR-T have adopted various approaches to integrate commercial CAR-T products into their program.

Recently, a lot of effort has been put into assessing the potential of gram-positive strains such as lactic acid bacteria for new applications in the production of heterologous proteins. Ama r 2 is a respiratory allergen from Amaranthus retroflexus, whose recombinant production in the probiotic host could be introduced as a specific and effective way to rapid diagnosis and  of this allergy. Consequently, the production of this recombinant protein using the prokaryotic system, requires a suitable SP to protect disulfide bonds and to prevent misfolding. This study was designed to predict the best SPs for the expression of Ama r 2 protein in Lactococcus lactis as the host. In this study, 42 signal sequences were selected from SP databases and the most important features of them were evaluated. First, n, h and c regions of the SPs and their probabilities were investigated by signalP software version 4.1. Then, their physicochemical properties were evaluated by Portparam and SOLpro.

In the need for more effective therapeutics, newly developed disease-targeted nanocompounds can thus hold real potential. In this paper, we propose a novel nanoparticle-based immunotherapeutic agent against ALL, consisting of antiCD19 antibody-conjugated, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-biocompatibilized, and Nile Blue (NB) Raman reporter-tagged gold nanoparticles of urchin-like shape (GNUs), that have a plasmonic response in the Near Infrared (NIR) spectral range. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of particle-incubated CD19-positive (CD19(+)) CCRF-SB cells show that the antiCD19-PEG-NB-GNU nanocomplex is able to recognize the CD19 -cell-specific antigen, which is a prerequisite for targeted therapy. The therapeutic effect of the particles is confirmed by cell counting, combined with cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry and MTS assay, which additionally offer insights into their mechanisms of action. Specifically, antiCD19-PEG-NB-GNUs proved superior cytotoxic effect against CCRF-SB cells when compared with the free antibody, by reducing the overall viability below 18% after 7 days treatment at a particle-bound antibody concentration of 0.17 ng/μl. Moreover, by combining their remarkable plasmonic properties with the possibility of Raman tagging, the proposed nanoparticles can also serve as spectroscopic imaging agents inside living cells, which validates their theranostic potential in the field of hematological oncology.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Few studies have examined this phenomenon in humans, and none have incorporated metatranscriptomics, important for determining expression of metagenomic functions in the microbial community.In melanoma patients undergoing , gut microbiome was characterized in pre-treatment stool using 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenome sequencing (n = 27). Transcriptional expression of metagenomic pathways was confirmed with metatranscriptome sequencing in a subset of 17. We examined associations of taxa and metagenomic pathways with progression-free survival (PFS) using 500 × 10-fold cross-validated elastic-net penalized Cox regression.Higher microbial community richness was associated with longer PFS in 16S and shotgun data (p < 0.05). Clustering based on overall microbiome composition divided patients into three groups with differing PFS; the low-risk group had 99% lower risk of progression than the high-risk group at any time during follow-up (p = 0.002). Among the species selected in regression, abundance of Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides massiliensis, Ruminococcus gnavus, and Blautia producta were related to shorter PFS, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus eutactus, Prevotella stercorea, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus anginosus, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3 1 46FAA to longer PFS. Metagenomic functions related to PFS that had correlated metatranscriptomic expression included risk-associated pathways of L-rhamnose degradation, guanosine nucleotide biosynthesis, and  vitamin biosynthesis.This work adds to the growing evidence that gut microbiota are related to  outcomes, and identifies, for the first time, transcriptionally expressed metagenomic pathways related to PFS.

PD-1-targeting antibodies have been evaluated, largely in patients with thymic carcinoma. We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-L1 antibody, avelumab (MSB0010718C), in patients with relapsed, advanced thymic epithelial tumors and conduct correlative immunological studies.Seven patients with thymoma and one patient with thymic carcinoma were enrolled in a phase I, dose-escalation trial of avelumab (MSB0010718C), and treated with avelumab at doses of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or development of intolerable side effects. Tissue and blood immunological analyses were conducted.Two of seven (29%) patients with thymoma had a confirmed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors-defined partial response, two (29%) had an unconfirmed partial response and three patients (two thymoma; one thymic carcinoma) had stable disease (43%). Three of four responses were observed after a single dose of avelumab. All responders developed immune-related adverse events that resolved with immunosuppressive therapy. Only one of four patients without a clinical response developed immune-related adverse events. Responders had a higher absolute lymphocyte count, lower frequencies of  cells, regulatory T cells, conventional dendritic cells, and natural killer cells prior to therapy.These results demonstrate anti-tumor activity of PD-L1 inhibition in patients with relapsed thymoma accompanied by a high frequency of immune-related adverse events.

However, knowledge about how to combine these therapies for optimal effects and what patients will best benefit from them is lacking. Here, we show that drug synergies can be identified by single cell signaling analyses. We investigated the effects of idelalisib, ibrutinib, and venetoclax on 35 protein epitopes by phospho flow in CLL cells. The activity of proteins in the -cell receptor signalosome and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway were altered upon drug exposure. Combined treatment with ibrutinib and venetoclax give promising results in clinical studies and we show that this combination exerted synergistic inhibitory effects on cell signaling and cell viability. Cell viability was monitored by flow cytometry and with independent drug sensitivity screens. Our analyses indicate that the standard dosages of ibrutinib and venetoclax can be lowered without loss of efficacy, potentially reducing drug costs, and toxicities. Observed correlation between signaling and viability indicates that signaling molecules could serve as biomarkers to predict response to therapy. We suggest that phospho flow should be considered as a novel approach for dose and synergy prediction in a precision medicine setting for CLL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632391>Genetic Variation in Low-To-Medium-Affinity Fcγ Receptors: Functional Consequences, Disease Associations, and Opportunities for Personalized Medicine.</a></h2><p>Fc-gamma receptors (FcγR) are the cellular receptors for Immunoglobulin G (IgG).

Next, we focus on the relevance of genetic variation in the  locus in auto-immune and auto-inflammatory diseases, highlighting pathophysiological insights that are informed by genetic association studies.

Accordingly, we evaluated the phenotypical and molecular changes of isogeneic human V600E BRAF-mutant melanoma cell line pairs pre- and post-treatment with vemurafenib. Three treatment naïve lines were subjected to in vitro long-term vemurafenib treatment while three pairs were pre- and post-treatment patient-derived lines. Molecular and phenotypical changes were assessed by Sulforhodamine- (SRB) assay, quantitative RT-PCR (q-RT-PCR), immunoblot, and time-lapse microscopy. We found that five out of six post-treatment cells had higher migration activity than pretreatment cells. However, no unequivocal correlation between increased migration and classic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers could be identified. In fast migrating cells, the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mRNA levels were considerably lower and significantly higher, respectively. Interestingly, high EGFR expression was associated with elevated migration but not with proliferation. Cells with high EGFR expression showed significantly decreased sensitivity to vemurafenib treatment, and had higher Erk activation and FRA-1 expression. Importantly, melanoma cells with higher EGFR expression were more resistant to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib treatment than cells with lower expression, with respect to both proliferation and migration inhibition.

Further molecular analyses found that focal adhesion kinase and NF-κ activation occurred in the MS-induced M1 polarization. Coculture of MS-preconditioned Mφ with B16F10 skin melanoma cells  showed that the proliferation of B16F10 cells decreased, whereas caspase-3-induced apoptosis increased. Importantly, the injection of MS-preconditioned Mφ into murine skin melanomas  impeded tumor growth; lesions were characterized by increased amounts of M1 Mφ, decreased tumor cell proliferation, and increased tumor cell apoptosis in the tumor microenvironment.

To further improve response rates, we explored combining anti-CTLA4 blockade with antisense suppression of CD47, an inhibitory receptor on T cells that limit T-cell receptor signaling and killing of irradiated target cells. Human melanoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed positive correlations between CD47 mRNA expression and expression of T-cell regulators including CTLA4 and its counter receptors CD80 and CD86. Antisense suppression of CD47 on human T cells in vitro using a translational blocking morpholino (CD47 m) alone or combined with anti-CTLA4 enhanced antigen-dependent killing of irradiated melanoma cells. Correspondingly, the treatment of locally irradiated B16F10 melanomas in C57BL/6 mice using combined blockade of CD47 and CTLA4 significantly increased the survival of mice relative to either treatment alone. CD47 m alone or in combination with anti-CTLA4 increased CD3 T-cell infiltration in irradiated tumors. Anti-CTLA4 also increased CD3 and CD8 T-cell infiltration as well as markers of NK cells in non-irradiated tumors. Anti-CTLA4 combined with CD47 m resulted in the greatest increase in intratumoral granzyme , interferon-γ, and NK-cell marker mRNA expression.

Targeting an appropriate  cell epitope in pathological tau could in theory produce an effective reduction of pathology without disrupting the function of normal native tau. Recent data demonstrate that the N-terminal region of tau (aa 2-18), termed the "phosphatase activation domain (PAD)", is hidden within native Tau in a 'paperclip'-like conformation. Conversely, PAD is exposed in pathological tau and plays an essential role in the inhibition of fast axonal transport and tau polymerization. Thus, we hypothesized that anti-tau2-18 antibodies may safely and specifically reduce pathological tau and prevent further aggregation, which in turn would neutralize tau toxicity. Therefore, we evaluated the immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy of our MultiTEP platform-based vaccine targeting tau2-18 formulated with Advax adjuvant (AV-1980R/A) in PS19 tau transgenic mice. The AV-1980R/A induced extremely high antibody responses and the resulting sera recognized neurofibrillary tangles and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites in AD brain sections. In addition, under non-denaturing conditions AV-1980R/A sera preferentially recognized AD-associated tau. Importantly, vaccination also prevented age-related motor and cognitive deficits in PS19 mice and significantly reduced insoluble total and phosphorylated tau species. Taken together, these findings suggest that predominantly targeting misfolded tau with AV-1980R/A could represent an effective strategy for AD .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31478418>Nasal instillation of probiotic extracts inhibits experimental allergic rhinitis.</a></h2><p> Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common disease.

In this line, quantitative and qualitative changes in tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) induced by vaccination with autologous tumor lysate/homogenate loaded DCs were investigated in a series of 16 patients with metastatic melanoma. Immunohistochemistry for CD4, CD8, Foxp3, Granzyme  (GZMB), PDL1, and HLA class I was performed in tumor biopsies collected before and after DC vaccination. The density of each marker was quantified by automated digital pathology analysis on whole slide images. Co-expression of markers defining functional phenotypes, i.e., Foxp3 regulatory CD4 T cells (Treg) and GZMB cytotoxic CD8 T cells, was assessed with sequential immunohistochemistry. A significant increase of CD8 TILs was found in post-vaccine biopsies of patients who were not previously treated with immune-modulating cytokines or Ipilimumab. Interestingly, along with a maintained tumoral HLA class I expression, after DC vaccination we observed a significant increase of PDL1 tumor cells, which significantly correlated with intratumoral CD8 T cell density. This observation might explain the lack of a significant concurrent cytotoxic reactivation of CD8 T cell, as measured by the numbers of GZMB T cells. Altogether these findings indicate that DC vaccination exerts an important role in sustaining or  inducing a T cell inflamed TME. However, the strength of the intratumoral T cell activation detected in post-DC therapy lesions is lessened by an occurring phenomenon of adaptive immune resistance, yet the concomitant PDL1 up-regulation. Overall, this study sheds light on DC -induced TME changes, lending the rationale for the design of smarter immune-combination therapies.Copyright © 2019 Bulgarelli, Tazzari, Granato, Ridolfi, Maiocchi, de Rosa, Petrini, Pancisi, Gentili, Vergani, Piccinini, Carbonaro, Leone, Foschi, Ancarani, Framarini and Guidoboni.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31478431>Validation of immunogenic PASD1 peptides against HLA-A*24:02 colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer is the third commonest malignancy in Asia including Malaysia. The immunogenic cancer-testis antigens, which are expressed in a variety of cancers but with limited expression in normal tissues except the testis, represent an attractive approach to improve treatment options for colorectal cancer. We aimed to validate four PASD1 peptides as the immunotherapeutic targets in colorectal cancer. First, PASD1 mRNA and protein expression were determined via real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. The PASD1 peptides specific to HLA-A*24:02 were investigated using IFN-y-ELISpot assay, followed by the cytolytic and granzyme--ELISpot assays to analyze the cytolytic effects of CD8 T cells. Gene and protein expressions of PASD1 were detected in 20% and 17.3% of colorectal cancer samples, respectively. PASD1(4) peptide was shown to be immunogenic in colorectal cancer samples. CD8 T cells raised against PASD1(4) peptide were able to lyze HLA-A*24:02+ PASD1+ cells. Our results reveal that PASD1(4) peptide represents a potential target for colorectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540435>Conceptual Development of Immunotherapeutic Approaches to Gastrointestinal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer is one of the common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Chemotherapy and/or  are the current treatments, but some patients do not derive clinical benefits. Recently, studies from cancer molecular subtyping have revealed that tumor molecular biomarkers may predict the immunotherapeutic response of GI cancer patients. However, the therapeutic response of patients selected by the predictive biomarkers is suboptimal. The tumor immune-microenvironment apparently plays a key role in modulating these molecular-determinant predictive biomarkers. Therefore, an understanding of the development and recent advances in immunotherapeutic pharmacological intervention targeting tumor immune-microenvironments and their potential predictive biomarkers will be helpful to strengthen patient immunotherapeutic efficacy. The current review focuses on an understanding of how the host-microenvironment interactions and the predictive biomarkers can determine the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The contribution of environmental pathogens and host immunity to GI cancer is summarized. A discussion regarding the clinical evidence of predictive biomarkers for clinical trial therapy design, current immunotherapeutic strategies, and the outcomes to GI cancer patients are highlighted. An understanding of the underlying mechanism can predict the immunotherapeutic efficacy and facilitate the future development of personalized therapeutic strategies targeting GI cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541850>Molecular targeted therapy of glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>Glioblastomas are intrinsic brain tumors thought to originate from neuroglial stem or progenitor cells. More than 90% of glioblastomas are isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype tumors. Incidence increases with age, males are more often affected. Beyond rare instances of genetic predisposition and irradiation exposure, there are no known glioblastoma risk factors. Surgery as safely feasible followed by involved-field radiotherapy plus concomitant and maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy define the standard of care since 2005. Except for prolonged progression-free, but not overall survival afforded by the vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, bevacizumab, no pharmacological intervention has been demonstrated to alter the course of disease. Specifically, targeting cellular pathways frequently altered in glioblastoma, such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase  (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the p53 and the retinoblastoma (RB) pathways, or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification or mutation, have failed to improve outcome, likely because of redundant compensatory mechanisms, insufficient target coverage related in part to the blood brain barrier, or poor tolerability and safety. Yet, uncommon glioblastoma subsets may exhibit specific vulnerabilities amenable to targeted interventions, including, but not limited to: high tumor mutational burden, BRAF mutation, neurotrophic tryrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) or fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene fusions, and MET gene amplification or fusions. There is increasing interest in targeting not only the tumor cells, but also the microenvironment, including blood vessels, the monocyte/macrophage/microglia compartment, or T cells. Improved clinical trial designs using pharmacodynamic endpoints in enriched patient populations will be required to develop better treatments for glioblastoma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the antibothropic serum produced by the Butantan Institute is remarkable in saving lives, studies show that some symptoms observed in cases of envenoming are not efficiently neutralized. Moreover, our group has shown that the commercial antivenom does not fully neutralize in vitro some serine proteases present in the Bothrops jararaca venom. Therefore, this study focuses on a new method in the production of specific immunoglobulins capable of neutralizing the activities of these enzymes in vitro. For this, a pool of serine proteases that was not inhibited by the commercial antivenom, made up of four enzymes (KN-BJ2, BjSP, HS112 and BPA) from the . jararaca venom was obtained through two chromatographic steps (DEAE-HPLC and C8-RP-HPLC). The identities of these proteases were confirmed by SDS-PAGE, followed by tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry analysis. This pool was inoculated into BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, using SBA-15 as adjuvant, and the produced IgGs were purified by affinity chromatography. The sera were characterized by ELISA, avidity and proteolytic neutralization assays. Both animal models responded to the immunization, producing higher IgGs titers when compared to the commercial antivenom. The experimental serum from BALB/c mice presented a better hydrolysis inhibition of the selective fluorescent substrate for serine proteases (~80%) when compared to C57BL/6 (~25%) and the commercial antivenom (<1%) at the dose of 500:1 (weight of antivenom:weight of venom). These results show that a different immunization method using isolated serine proteases improves the toxins neutralizing efficacy and could lead to a better end product to be used as a supplemental medicine to the currently used .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Neoepitopes represent a viable option to induce antitumor immune responses, but they have limitations, such as low immunogenicity and tolerance induction. Parvovirus B19 virus-like particles may be used to deliver neoepitopes to prime cellular immunity. We designed and evaluated the therapeutic effect of VP2 B19-virus-like particles, with multi-neoepitopes, in a 4T1 breast cancer model. Balb/c mice received four therapeutic immunizations with multi-neoepitopes-virus-like, wild type-virus-like, vehicle, or virus-like plus Cry1Ac adjuvant particles, intraperitoneally and peritumorally. Tumor growth, lung macro-metastasis, and specific immune responses were evaluated. Therapeutic administration of multi-epitopes virus-like particles significantly delayed tumor growth and decreased the lung macro-metastasis number, in comparison to treatment with wild type-virus-like particles, which surprisingly also elicited antitumoral effects that were improved with the adjuvant. Only treatments with multi-epitope virus-like particles induced specific proliferative responses of CD8 and CD4 T lymphocytes and Granzyme- production in lymphatic nodes local to the tumor. Treatment with recombinant multiple neoepitopes-virus-like particles induced specific cellular responses, inhibited tumor growth and macro-metastasis, thus B19-virus-like particles may function as an effective delivery system for neoepitopes for personalized .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Agonistic anti-CD137 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy has been combined with other chemotherapeutic agents in human cancer trials. Based on its ability to promote tumor clearance, we hypothesized that anti-CD137 mAb might activate immune responses and resolve chronic viral infections. We evaluated anti-CD137 mAb therapy in a mouse infection model of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus that causes chronic polyarthritis in humans, and is associated with reservoirs of CHIKV RNA that are not cleared efficiently by adaptive immune responses. Analysis of viral tropism revealed that CHIKV RNA preferentially was present in splenic  cells and follicular dendritic cells during the persistent phase of infection, and animals lacking  cells did not develop persistent CHIKV infection in lymphoid tissue. Anti-CD137 mAb treatment resulted in a T cell-dependent clearance of CHIKV RNA in lymphoid tissue, although this effect was not observed in musculoskeletal tissue. The clearance of CHIKV RNA from lymphoid tissue by anti-CD137 mAb was associated with reductions in numbers of germinal center  cells and follicular dendritic cells. Similar results were observed with anti-CD137 mAb treatment of mice infected with Mayaro virus (MAYV), a related arthritogenic alphavirus. Thus, anti-CD137 mAb treatment promotes resolution of chronic alphavirus infection in lymphoid tissues by reducing the number of target cells for infection and persistence. Although chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes persistent infection in lymphoid and musculoskeletal tissues in multiple animals, the basis for this is poorly understood, which has hampered pharmacological efforts for promoting viral clearance. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic effects on persistent CHIKV infection of an agonistic anti-CD137 antibody, which can activate T cell and NK cell responses to clear tumors. We show that treatment with anti-CD137 promotes the clearance of persistent alphavirus RNA from lymphoid but not musculoskeletal tissues. This occurs because anti-CD137 antibody-triggered T cells reduce the number of target germinal center  cells and follicular dendritic cells, which are the primary reservoir for CHIKV in the spleen and lymph nodes. Our studies help to elucidate the basis for CHIKV persistence and begin to provide strategies that can clear long-term cellular reservoirs of infection.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661975>Single Cell Sequencing of Mouse Heart Immune Infiltrate in Pressure Overload-Driven Heart Failure Reveals Extent of Immune Activation.</a></h2><p> Inflammation is a key component of cardiac disease, with macrophages and T lymphocytes mediating essential roles in the progression to heart failure (HF). Nonetheless, little insight exists on other immune subsets involved in the cardiotoxic response.  Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to map the cardiac immune composition in the standard murine non-ischemic, pressure-overload HF model. By focusing our analysis on CD45 cells, we obtained a higher resolution identification of the immune cell subsets in the heart, at early and late stages of disease and in controls. We then integrated our findings using multi-parameter flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and tissue clarification immunofluorescence, in mouse and human.  We found that most major immune cell subpopulations, including macrophages,  cells, T cells and regulatory T cells (Treg), dendritic cells, NK cells, neutrophils and mast cells are present in both healthy and diseased hearts. Most cell subsets are found within the myocardium, whilst mast cells are found also in the epicardium. Upon induction of pressure overload, immune activation occurs across the entire range of immune cell types. Activation led to upregulation of key subset-specific molecules, such as Osm in pro-inflammatory macrophages and PD-1 in Treg, that may help explain clinical findings such as the refractivity of HF patients to anti-TNF therapy and cardiac toxicity during anti-PD-1 cancer , respectively.  Despite the absence of infectious agents or an autoimmune trigger, induction of disease leads to immune activation that involves far more cell types than previously thought, including neutrophils,  cells, NK cells and mast cells. This opens up the field of cardio-immunology to further investigation using toolkits that have already been developed to study the immune subsets above. The subset-specific molecules that mediate their activation may thus become useful targets for diagnostics or therapy of HF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597242>The Role of Immune Checkpoint Receptors in Regulating Immune Reactivity in Lupus.</a></h2><p>Immune checkpoint receptors with co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory signals are important modulators for the immune system. However, unrestricted co-stimulation and/or inadequate co-inhibition may cause breakdown of self-tolerance, leading to autoimmunity. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex multi-organ disease with skewed and dysregulated immune responses interacting with genetics and the environment. The close connections between co-signaling pathways and SLE have gradually been established in past research. Also, the recent success of immune checkpoint blockade in cancer therapy illustrates the importance of the co-inhibitory receptors in cancer . Moreover, immune checkpoint blockade could result in substantial immune-related adverse events that mimic autoimmune diseases, including lupus. Together, immune checkpoint regulators represent viable immunotherapeutic targets for the treatment of both autoimmunity and cancer. Therefore, it appears reasonable to treat SLE by restoring the out-of-order co-signaling axis or by manipulating collateral pathways to control the pathogenic immune responses. Here, we review the current state of knowledge regarding the relationships between SLE and the co-signaling pathways of T cells,  cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, and highlight their potential clinical implications. Current clinical trials targeting the specific co-signaling axes involved in SLE help to advance such knowledge, but further in-depth exploration is still warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497530>The Evolving Role of Taxanes in Combination With Cetuximab for the Treatment of Recurrent and/or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck: Evidence, Advantages, and Future Directions.</a></h2><p>The addition of cetuximab to platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin plus 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]), followed by maintenance cetuximab until disease progression (EXTREME), resulted in the first regimen to yield significantly improved survival outcomes in the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) in over 30 years. Currently, the EXTREME regimen is a guideline-recommended treatment in the first-line R/M setting, and, therefore, it is used as a control arm in all new first-line, phase 3  trials. More recently, new checkpoint inhibitor approaches have emerged and are changing the treatment landscape for PD-L1-positive patients with R/M SCCHN. Additionally, alternative chemotherapy backbones in R/M SCCHN are continually investigated. Replacing 5-FU with a taxane in the EXTREME regimen seeks to take advantage of the potential immunogenic and proapoptotic synergy between cetuximab and docetaxel or paclitaxel. These cetuximab-, platinum-, and taxane-based treatments have demonstrated promising survival results and cytoreductive properties in single-arm studies. Thus, these combination treatments may be of importance to patients with high tumor burden and dangerous site involvements (e.g., causing bleeding, suffocation, dysphagia, or ulceration), in whom symptom relief is a key treatment goal. TPExtreme is the first large, randomized trial comparing a cetuximab, platinum, and taxane combination regimen with EXTREME. Currently, the substitution of 5-FU with a taxane is a feasible and clinically beneficial option for patients with contraindications to 5-FU. The TPEx regimen appears to be a new option in first-line R/M SCCHN, with a shorter time on CT and significantly lower toxicity than the EXTREME regimen. For patients with R/M disease in whom further cisplatin- or carboplatin-based treatment is unsuitable, or whose disease has already progressed on first-line R/M therapy, treatment options such as cetuximab plus a taxane, which capitalize on the combinative ability of the 2 agents, can be considered. Notably, it is as of yet unknown what second-line treatments may be suitable to follow a checkpoint inhibitor-based first-line therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501368>Retrospective Analysis of 20 Patients with DLBCL Who Received MCVAC Followed by Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation.</a></h2><p>Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation(auto-PBSCT)combined with high-dose chemotherapy has been considered as the standard therapy for relapsed or induction therapy-refractory aggressive lymphomas sensitive to chemotherapy.

We have begun to employ high-dose ranimustine,cytarabine,etoposide and cyclophosphamide(MCVAC)regimen. The present study was undertaken to review the efficacy and safety of MCVAC. Regimen: We carried out a retrospective analysis of 20 patients diagnosed as diffuse large -cell lymphoma. The median follow-up duration of 20 patients was 13.05 months(range, 0.57-49.5 months). The 4-year OS and PFS were 57.8% and 30.2%,respectively. Relapse was the most frequent cause of treatment failure(n=7). The major toxicities were anorexia/nausea(95%),diarrhea (75%),hypokalemia (70%). One patient died of hepatic veno-occlusive disease(VOD). The serious adverse events included hypokalemia,arrhythmia,cerebral hemorrhage,and heart failure(1 case[5%]each). There was 1 case of a late-onset adverse event: therapy-related myelo- dysplastic syndrome/acute myeloblastic leukemia(MDS/AML). MCVAC regimen was concluded as effective and well-toler- ated.

We examined whether this ligand is a prognostic marker for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and whether it is associated with accumulation of immune cells in the tumor. Serum s-CD95L levels in 51 patients with advanced ovarian cancer were tested by ELISA. IHC staining of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD163, CD31, FoxP3, CCR6, IL-17, Granzyme , PD-L1, and membrane CD95L was used to assess tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Although the intensity of CD3, CD8, CD4, CD20, and CD163 in tumor tissues remained constant regardless of membrane CD95L expression, tumors in patients with HGSOC with s-CD95L levels ≥516 pg/mL showed increased infiltration by CD3 T cells ( = 0.001), comprising both cytotoxic CD8 ( = 0.01) and CD4 ( = 0.0062) cells including FoxP3 regulatory T cells ( = 0.0044). Also, the number of tumor-infiltrating CD20  cells ( = 0.0094) increased in these patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that low s-CD95L concentrations [<516 pg/mL, HR, 3.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-11.11), and <1,200 activated CD8 (Granzyme ) cells (HR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.16-5.95) were independent poor prognostic factors for recurrence, whereas >6,000 CD3 cells (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15-0.79) was a good prognostic factor. Thus, low levels of s-CD95L (<516 pg/mL) are correlated with lower numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD3 and CD8, and also CD4 and FoxP3 T cells) in advanced HGSOC and are a poor prognostic marker. IMPLICATIONS: Serum s-CD95L is correlated with a number of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in HGSOC and could be used as a noninvasive marker of tumor immune infiltration to select patients referred for  trials that evaluate checkpoint inhibitor treatment.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622284>Vaccination Coverage by Age 24 Months Among Children Born in 2015 and 2016 - National Immunization Survey-Child, United States, 2016-2018.</a></h2><p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that children be vaccinated against 14 potentially serious illnesses during the first 24 months of life (1). CDC used data from the National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child) to assess vaccination coverage with the recommended number of doses of each vaccine at the national, state, territorial, and selected local levels* among children born in 2015 and 2016. Coverage by age 24 months was at least 90% nationally for ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine, ≥1 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), ≥3 doses of hepatitis  vaccine (HepB), and ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine, although MMR coverage was <90% in 20 states. Children were least likely to be up to date by age 24 months with ≥2 doses of influenza vaccine (56.6%). Only 1.3% of children born in 2015 and 2016 had received no vaccinations by the second birthday. Coverage was lower for uninsured children and for children insured by Medicaid than for those with private health insurance. Vaccination coverage can be increased by improving access to vaccine providers and eliminating missed opportunities to vaccinate children during health care visits.

Management includes surgery and medical treatment in the form of local and/or systemic steroids. However, some cases are resistant to the action of steroids and further treatment is warranted. Being an immune-mediated disorder, targeting IgE seems a logical step.  drugs acting on the IgE (e.g. omalizumab) can modify the clinical course of the disease. This study aimed at evaluating the effect of omalizumab on the clinical course of patients undergoing surgery for AFRS.This is a two-arm prospective, randomized, single blind clinical trial among patients with AFRS. Twenty patients were included and randomly divided into two groups: Group A; 10 patients received a single subcutaneous injection of omalizumab (Xolair ' Novartis) (150 mg) 2 weeks postoperatively. Group : 10 patients received local steroids nasal sprays (budesonide or mometasone furoate, 100 μg twice daily for 6 months, starting 2 weeks postoperatively. All patients underwent history, examination, CT scan and IgE level estimation and were submitted to endoscopic sinus surgery. They were evaluated at 4 weeks interval for 6 months.In both groups there were highly significant differences between pre/post-operative SNOT-20 scores, TNSS scores, total IgE level and Philpott-Javer staging scores. Comparison between the two study groups at 24 weeks showed a highly significant difference (p = 0.001) between post-operative SNOT 20 and TNSS scores in favour of group A. There was no statistically significant difference between the two study groups as regarding postoperative total IgE or Philpott-Javer scores. There were two recurrences in both arms, but no significant side effects.We compared a single post operative injection of omalizumab with twice daily intranasal steroid spray for 6 months. Both treatments were effective, but the omalizumab group showed a more significant clinical and endoscopic response. There were no significant side effects in both arms. This novel approach used a single low dose injection of omalizumab increased the compliance of the patients with minimal complications. Longer follow-up of the patients is ongoing to determine the optimal time for re-injection.

Recently, we observed that different γδ T cell subsets as well as CD8 αβ T cells infiltrate the pancreatic tissue. Interestingly, the abundance of γδ T cells was reported to have a positive prognostic impact on survival of cancer patients. Since γδ T cells utilize TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) for killing of tumor cells in addition to granzyme  and perforin, we investigated the role of the TRAIL-/TRAIL-R system in γδ T cell-cytotoxicity toward pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and other cancer cells. Coculture of the different cancer cells with γδ T cells resulted in a moderate lysis of tumor cells. The lysis of PDAC Colo357 cells was independent of TRAIL as it was not inhibited by the addition of neutralizing anti-TRAIL antibodies or TRAIL-R2-Fc fusion protein. In accordance, knockdown (KD) of death receptors TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2 in Colo357 cells had no effect on γδ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. However, KD of decoy receptor TRAIL-R4, which robustly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis, interestingly, almost completely abolished the γδ T cell-mediated lysis of these tumor cells. This effect was associated with a reduced secretion of granzyme  by γδ T cells and enhanced PGE2 production as a result of increased expression level of synthetase cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 by TRAIL-R4-KD cells. In contrast, knockin of TRAIL-R4 decreased COX-2 expression. Importantly, reduced release of granzyme  by γδ T cells cocultured with TRAIL-R4-KD cells was partially reverted by bispecific antibody [HER2xCD3] and led in consequence to enhanced lysis of tumor cells. Likewise, inhibition of COX-1 and/or COX-2 partially enhanced γδ T cell-mediated lysis of TRAIL-R4-KD cells. The combination of bispecific antibody and COX-inhibitor completely restored the lysis of TRAIL-R4-KD cells by γδ T cells. In conclusion, we uncovered an unexpected novel role of TRAIL-R4 in tumor cells. In contrast to its known pro-tumoral, anti-apoptotic function, TRAIL-R4 augments the anti-tumoral cytotoxic activity of γδ T cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534890>Sinonasal Melanoma: A Single Institutional Analysis and Future Directions.</a></h2><p>  Sinonasal melanoma is a rare disease with a high mortality rate.

This mutation leads to significantly reduced numbers of circulatory  cells and serum immunoglobulins in patients. Therefore, they exhibit repetitive bacterial infections since infancy, and immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy is the primary treatment. HLH is a life-threatening condition with manifestations of non-remitting fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, coagulopathy, lipid disorder, and multiple organ failure. It is caused by the immune dysregulation between cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and histiocytes. The treatment is based on HLH-2004 protocol including , chemotherapy, supportive therapy, and stem cell transplantation. However, as we know more about the classification and pathophysiology of HLH, the treatment is modified. T-cell-directed  is effective in patients with primary HLH, and strong immunosuppression is contraindicated in patients with severe ongoing infections or some primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). Here, we report the case of a 7-year-old boy who presented with ecthyma gangrenosum and several episodes of pyogenic infections during childhood.

Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that arise from lymphocytes and typically develop in lymphoid tissues. It has been recognized that the elements of the lymphoma microenvironment are not mere bystanders to a host antitumor inflammatory response but are important components of the tumor that support proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance of lymphoma cells. Lymphoma cells have individual expression patterns of chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules, according to their histological subtypes, and the patterns of surface molecules determine the sites of tumor involvement. Lymphoma cells often depend on the signals provided by non-tumor cells, such as stromal cells and macrophages, through direct cell contact and paracrine factors. On the other hand, there are genetic and non-genetic mechanisms allowing lymphoma cells to escape from anti-tumor immunity, such as downregulation of HLA molecules, B2M, CD58, CD70, and/or upregulation of PD-L1 and PD-L2. Further understanding of the interactions of lymphoma cells and the tumor microenvironment gives an insight into the pathogenesis of lymphomas and supports new approaches to their treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610784>Canine non-, non-T NK lymphocytes have a potential antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity function against antibody-coated tumor cells.</a></h2><p>The antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a cell-mediated immune defense mechanism in which effector immune cells actively lyse antibody-coated target cells. The ADCC of tumor cells is employed in the treatment of various cancers overexpressing unique antigens, and only natural killer (NK) cells are known to be major effectors of antibody mediated ADCC activity. Canine NK cells are still defined as non-, non-T large granular lymphocytes because of the lack of information regarding the NK cell-restricted specific marker in dogs, and it has never been demonstrated that canine NK cells have ADCC ability against tumor cells. In the present study, we investigated whether canine non-, non-T NK cells have ADCC ability against target antibody-coated tumor cells, using cetuximab and trastuzumab, the only human antibodies reported binding to canine cancer cells.Activated canine non-, non-T NK cells (CD3CD21CD5TCRαβTCRγδ) for 13~17 days ex vivo showed ADCC ability against trastuzumab- or cetuximab-coated target tumor cells expressing various levels of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Trastuzumab and cetuximab induced significant ADCC responses of canine NK cells even in CMT-U334 and CF41.Mg cells expressing low levels of HER-2 and/or EGFR, as well as in SKBR3 and DU145 cells overexpressing HER-2 and/or EGFR. The trastuzumab-mediated ADCC activity of NK cells was significantly enhanced by treatment with rcIL-21.The results of this study suggest that canine non-, non-T NK lymphocytes have a potential ADCC function and that combinational strategies of monoclonal antibodies with either cytokines, which activate NK cells in vivo, or adoptive transfer of NK cells may be a feasible method for amplifying the efficacy of  against malignant cancers even with very low expression of target molecules in dogs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547472>CD123 as a Therapeutic Target in the Treatment of Hematological Malignancies.</a></h2><p>The interleukin-3 receptor alpha chain (IL-3R), more commonly referred to as CD123, is widely overexpressed in various hematological malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), -cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma and particularly, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic neoplasm (BPDCN). Importantly, CD123 is expressed at both the level of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and more differentiated leukemic blasts, which makes CD123 an attractive therapeutic target. Various agents have been developed as drugs able to target CD123 on malignant leukemic cells and on the normal counterpart. Tagraxofusp (SL401, Stemline Therapeutics), a recombinant protein composed of a truncated diphtheria toxin payload fused to IL-3, was approved for use in patients with BPDCN in December of 2018 and showed some clinical activity in AML. Different monoclonal antibodies directed against CD123 are under evaluation as antileukemic drugs, showing promising results either for the treatment of AML minimal residual disease or of relapsing/refractory AML or BPDCN. Finally, recent studies are exploring T cell expressing CD123 chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cells (CAR T) as a new  for the treatment of refractory/relapsing AML and BPDCN. In December of 2018, MB-102 CD123 CAR T developed by Mustang Bio Inc. received the Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of BPDCN. In conclusion, these recent studies strongly support CD123 as an important therapeutic target for the treatment of BPDCN, while a possible in the treatment of AML and other hematological malignancies will have to be evaluated by in the ongoing clinical studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665051> in HER2-positive breast cancer: state of the art and future perspectives.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer (BC) is a complex disease with primary or acquired incurability characteristics in a significant part of patients. Immunotherapeutical agents represent an emerging option for breast cancer treatment, including the human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (HER2+) subtype. The immune system holds the ability to spontaneously implement a defensive response against HER2+ BC cells through complex mechanisms which can be exploited to modulate this response for obtaining a clinical benefit. Initial immune system modulating strategies consisted mostly in vaccine therapies, which are still being investigated and improved. However, the entrance of trastuzumab into the scenery of HER2+ BC treatment was the real game changing event, which embodied a dominant immune-mediated mechanism. More recently, the advent of the immune checkpoint inhibitors has caused a new paradigm shift for immuno-oncology, with promising initial results also for HER2+ BC. Breast cancer has been traditionally considered poorly immunogenic, being characterized by relatively low tumor mutation burden (TMB). Nevertheless, recent evidence has revealed high tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in a considerable proportion of HER2+ BC patients. This may translate into a higher potential to elicit anti-cancer response and, therefore, wider possibilities for the use and implementation of  in this subset of BC patients. We are herein presenting and critically discussing the most representative evidence concerning  in HER2+ BC cancer, both singularly and in combination with therapeutic agents acting throughout HER2-block, immune checkpoint inhibition and anti-cancer vaccines.

Indeed, remission rates reach more than 80 % in patients at a stage, without any other possibilities of treatment, notably in the child's acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These results, initially resulting from academic research, led to Food and Drug accreditation for market access of two innovative autologous therapy drugs, Kimryah® and Yescarta®. Based on the impressive clinical results, mainly so far in hematological malignancies (LAL, MM, LBDGC, etc.), the development of several types of cells expressing a CAR receptor suggests a wide range of future applications, particularly in the field of solid tumors. However, while the development of CAR-T cells now appears to be in the hands of private pharmaceuticals companies, the logistical constraints, the cryopreservation and the very high cost of these personalized medicines may ultimately limit their use. The development of academic productions by CAR-T cells could bypass some of these disadvantages. The strong innovation capacity of healthcare institutions associated with research units allows them to identify the ideal tumor target and efficient performing cells. Thus, authorized production platforms could allow for shorter administration times and reasonable production costs for national health systems. The aim of this workshop is to identify the requirements for the academic production of CAR-T cells, while respecting the research standards useful to establish proof of concept, but also at the preclinical development stage, leading in fine to the manufacture, through an authorized pharmaceutical establishment, of the innovative therapy drug, and in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).

Etiology-associated dysregulation of immune-associated (IA) genes may be central to the development of this differential clinical response. We identified immune-associated genes potentially dysregulated by alcohol or viral hepatitis  in HCC and validated alcohol-induced dysregulations in vitro while using large-scale RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thirty-four clinically relevant dysregulated IA genes were identified. We profiled the correlation of all genomic alterations in HCC patients to IA gene expression while using the information theory-based algorithm REVEALER to investigate the molecular mechanism for their dysregulation and explore the possibility of genome-based patient stratification. We also studied gene expression regulators and identified multiple microRNAs that were implicated in HCC pathogenesis that can potentially regulate these IA genes' expression. Our study identified potential key pathways, including the IL-7 signaling pathway and TNFRSF4 (OX40)- NF-κ pathway, to target in  treatments and presents microRNAs as promising therapeutic targets for dysregulated IA genes because of their extensive regulatory roles in the cancer immune landscape.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530559>Myeloid-Derived Suppressive Cells Promote  cell-Mediated Immunosuppression via Transfer of PD-L1 in Glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>The potent immunosuppression induced by glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the primary obstacles to finding effective immunotherapies. One hallmark of the GBM-associated immunosuppressive landscape is the massive infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and, to a lesser extent, regulatory T cells (Treg) within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we showed that regulatory  cells (Breg) are a prominent feature of the GBM microenvironment in both preclinical models and clinical samples. Forty percent of GBM patients ( = 60) scored positive for -cell tumor infiltration. Human and mouse GBM-associated Bregs were characterized by immunosuppressive activity toward activated CD8 T cells, the overexpression of inhibitory molecules PD-L1 and CD155, and production of immunosuppressive cytokines TGFβ and IL10. Local delivery of  cell-depleting anti-CD20  improved overall survival of animals (IgG vs. anti-CD20 mean survival: 18.5 vs. 33 days,  = 0.0001), suggesting a potential role of Bregs in GBM progression. We unveiled that GBM-associated MDSCs promoted regulatory -cell function by delivering microvesicles transporting membrane-bound PD-L1, able to be up-taken by tumoral  cells. The transfer of functional PD-L1 via microvesicles conferred Bregs the potential to suppress CD8 T-cell activation and acquisition of an effector phenotype. This work uncovered the role of  cells in GBM physiopathology and provides a mechanism by which the GBM microenvironment controls  cell-mediated immunosuppression.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657787>Beclin-1 as a neutrophil-specific immune checkpoint.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils are early wound healing and inflammation regulators that, due to functional plasticity, can adopt either pro- or antitumor functions.

In this issue of the JCI, Tan et al. describe the effects of the beclin-1 conditional myeloid cell-specific deletion in mice, in which immunostimulation resulted in hypersensitive neutrophils. The chronic proinflammatory effect of these neutrophils triggered spontaneous  cell malignancies to develop. Such tumorigenic effects were mediated primarily by IL-21 and CD40 signaling, leading to the upregulation of tolerogenic molecules, such as IL-10 and PD-L1.

Multimodal therapies employing agents that can affect different arms of the immune system and/or tumor microenvironment might increase clinical responses.We demonstrate that entinostat, a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor, enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of the IL-15 superagonist, N-803 plus vaccine in 4T1 triple-negative breast and MC38-CEA colon murine carcinoma models. A comprehensive immune and gene expression analysis was performed in the periphery and/or tumor microenvironment (TME) of MC38-CEA tumor-bearing mice.Although N-803 plus vaccine induced peripheral CD8 T cell activation and cytokine production, there was no reduction in tumor burden and poor tumor infiltration of CD8 T cells with minimal levels of granzyme . For the first time, we demonstrate that the addition of entinostat to N-803 plus vaccine promoted significant tumor control, correlating with increased expression of genes associated with tumor inflammation, enhanced infiltration of activated CD8 T cells with maximal granzyme , T-cell responses to multiple tumor-associated antigens, increased serum IFNg, reduction of regulatory T cells in the TME, and decreased expression of the checkpoint V-domain Ig Suppressor of T cell Activation (VISTA) on multiple immune subsets.Collectively, these data demonstrate that the synergistic combination of entinostat, N-803, and vaccine elicits potent anti-tumor activity by generating a more inflamed TME.

Current theories on regulation of inflammation center on anti-tumor T cell responses. Here we show that tumor associated  cells are vital to melanoma associated inflammation. Human  cells express pro- and anti-inflammatory factors and differentiate into plasmablast-like cells when exposed to autologous melanoma secretomes in vitro. This plasmablast-like phenotype can be reconciled in human melanomas where plasmablast-like cells also express T cell-recruiting chemokines CCL3, CCL4, CCL5. Depletion of  cells in melanoma patients by anti-CD20  decreases tumor associated inflammation and CD8 T cell numbers. Plasmablast-like cells also increase PD-1 T cell activation through anti-PD-1 blockade in vitro and their frequency in pretherapy melanomas predicts response and survival to immune checkpoint blockade.

The tumor-associated antigen L6 (TAL6) is overexpressed on the surface of different cancer cells and promotes cancer progression; therefore, it could be a potential target for cancer treatment. We have revealed that a synthetic peptide containing HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and  cell epitope can induce cellular and humoral immunity against TAL6-expressing cancer. To enhance the efficacy of , in this report, we designed an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting sequence (adenovirus E3/19K protein) at the N-terminus of TAL6 to facilitate MHC class I antigen presentation to CD8 T cells. Transfection of mammalian cells with the plasmid containing TAL6 fused with the ER-targeting sequence (pEKL6) resulted in higher levels of TAL6 antigens in the ER than transfection with the full-length TAL6 (pL6). The plasmid pEKL6 induced both TAL6-specific CTL responses and antibody titers after intramuscular (IM) immunization with electroporation and it elicited higher levels of antigen-specific CTLs in HLA-A2 transgenic mice. Immunization with pEKL6 induced higher levels of protective antitumor immunity against tumor growth than pL6 immunization in thymoma and melanoma tumor animal models. Notably, pEKL6 elicited long-term anti-tumor immunity against the recurrence of cancers. We found that CD4 T, CD8 T, and NK cells are all important for the effector mechanisms of pEKL6 immunization. Thus, cancer therapy using an ER-targeting sequence linked to a tumor antigen holds promise for treating tumors by triggering strong immune reactions.AJCR Copyright © 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547713>Early Efficacy Analysis of Cluster and Conventional  in Patients With Allergic Rhinitis.</a></h2><p>Specific  is an important immune-modifying treatment for patients with allergic rhinitis (AR).

We aimed to develop a long-acting delivery system for Herceptin, a HER2-targeting antibody, using injectable and thermosensitive hydrogels as the carrier to prevent the local relapse of HER2+ breast tumors while minimizing systemic side effects, especially cardiotoxicity. : Two poly(lactic acid--glycolic acid)--poly(ethylene glycol)--poly(lactic acid--glycolic acid) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) triblock copolymers with different PEG/PLGA proportions were synthesized. Their mixtures with rational mix proportions displayed sol-gel transitions in water with rising of temperature and the Herceptin-loaded hydrogel systems were then prepared. Both the  antitumor and anti-relapse efficacies were evaluated after hypodermic injection of the Herceptin-loaded hydrogel, and the cardiotoxicity was also detected. : The gel performance, degradation rate and drug release kinetics of hydrogels were easily adjustable by simply varying the mix proportion. The hydrogel matrix with a specific mix proportion not only avoided initial burst release but also achieved sustained release of Herceptin  for up to 80 days, which is the longest period of Herceptin delivery that has ever been reported.  biodistribution studies performed in SK-BR-3 tumor-bearing mice revealed that a single hypodermic administration of the Herceptin-loaded hydrogel adjacent to the tumor tissue promoted the intratumoral antibody accumulation. This resulted in a better antitumor efficacy compared to weekly hypodermic injections of Herceptin solution for 28 days. A tumor relapse model was also established by imitative breast-conserving surgery on tumor-bearing mice, and both the single injection of the Herceptin-loaded hydrogel and the weekly injection of the Herceptin solution achieved superior anti-relapse efficacy. Furthermore, both antitumor and anti-relapse experiments demonstrated that the weekly pulsed administration of the Herceptin solution caused cardiotoxicity; however, the sustained release of Herceptin from the hydrogel effectively prevented this side effect. : The Herceptin-loaded hydrogel has great potential for preventing the relapse of HER2+ breast tumors after breast-conserving surgery with enhanced therapeutic efficacy, improved patient compliance and significantly reduced side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646089>Dexamethasone differentially depletes tumour and peripheral blood lymphocytes and can impact the efficacy of chemotherapy/checkpoint blockade combination treatment.</a></h2><p>Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid commonly used for the prevention and management of side effects in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. While it is effective as an anti-emetic and in preventing hypersensitivity reactions, dexamethasone depletes peripheral blood lymphocytes and impacts immune responses. The effect of dexamethasone on the number and quality of tumour-infiltrating leukocytes has not been reported. To address this, we calibrated the dose in two different strains of mice to achieve the same extent of peripheral blood lymphocyte depletion observed in patients with cancer. Doses that caused analogous depletion of T and  lymphocytes and NK cells from the peripheral blood, elicited no change in these populations within the tumour. The expression of immune checkpoint molecules PD-1, OX40, GITR and TIM3 on tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes was not altered. We found that dexamethasone had a small but significant deleterious impact on weakly efficacious chemoimmunotherapy but had no effect when the protocol was highly efficacious. Based on these results, we predict that dexamethasone will have a modest negative influence on the overall effectiveness of chemoimmunotherapy treatment.© 2019 The Author(s).

Poor DC development can limit the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade and  vaccination approaches. Interference in intracellular signaling cascades downstream from the receptors of major tumor-associated suppressive cytokines like IL-10 and IL-6, might improve DC development and activation, and thus enhance  efficacy. We performed exploratory functional screens on arrays consisting of >1000 human kinase peptide substrates to identify pathways involved in DC development and its inhibition by IL-10 or IL-6. The resulting alterations in phosphorylation of the kinome substrate profile pointed to glycogen-synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) as a pivotal kinase in both DC development and suppression. GSK3β inhibition blocked human DC differentiation , which was accompanied by decreased levels of IL-12p70 secretion, and a reduced capacity for T cell priming. More importantly, adenoviral transduction of monocytes with a constitutively active form of GSK3β induced resistance to the suppressive effects of IL-10 and melanoma-derived supernatants alike, resulting in improved DC development, accompanied by up-regulation of co-stimulatory markers, an increase in CD83 expression levels in mature DC, and diminished release of IL-10. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated intratumoral manipulation of this pathway in an  melanoma model resulted in DC activation and recruitment, and in improved immune surveillance and tumor control. We propose the induction of constitutive GSK3β activity as a novel therapeutic means to bolster DC functionality in the tumor microenvironment.© 2019 The Author(s).

Yet, patients with advanced PCa have few, if any, curative options. Recent success in treating patients with hematological malignancies of -cell origin using T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) has inspired multiple groups worldwide to adapt this approach to the problem of late-stage PCa.To summarize the available clinical results for CAR T-cell therapy of PCa and discuss future technological advancements in the CAR T-cell field that may help patients with metastatic PCa.A literature review was conducted of clinical trial data, abstracts presented at recent oncology conferences, as well as reports highlighting critical bottlenecks of CAR T-cell therapy that became apparent from preclinical and clinical studies.Current understanding of why CAR T-cell therapy may fail, particularly in the context of solid cancers, is as follows. First, a CAR design that provides potent activity and persistence of engineered T cells in the hostile tumor microenvironment is a must. The choice of the targetable epitope(s) is critical to counteract tumor antigen escape. Preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy can be enhanced significantly in combination with other therapeutic approaches. We propose that several improvements to CAR design and patient conditioning, such as unbiased identification of novel PCa-specific CAR targets, use of next-generation (multispecific, resistant to the tumor microenvironment, and with prolonged persistence) CAR T-cell products, and combination therapies may translate into improved patient outcomes and more durable responses.Although significant preclinical experience of testing CAR T cells in solid cancer models has identified important technological and biological bottlenecks, information from clinical trials, particularly those focusing on the PCa, will be instrumental to the rational design of advanced CAR T therapies that will be both safe and effective in patients with advanced PCa.So far, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has not shown significant activity in patients with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). CAR T-cell products used for such trials represent one of the pioneering efforts to adapt this technology to the problem of metastatic PCa. In retrospect, both CAR design and cell composition appear to have been suboptimal to expect strong patient responses. Given the impressive results of CAR-based approaches observed in preclinical models of solid cancers, emerging CAR T-cell products are expected to be more successful in the clinic. Here, we discuss the challenges that need to be overcome to boost the efficacy of PCa-targeted CAR T-cell therapy and call for dialogue between clinicians and cell biologists to address these challenges.Copyright © 2019 European Association of Urology.

Recent work using human DLBCL transcriptomes has suggested that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a key role in lymphoma pathogenesis and pinpointed a restricted number of lncRNAs as potential targets for further studies.To expand the knowledge of non-coding molecules involved in canine BCL, we used transcriptomes obtained from a cohort of 62 dogs with newly-diagnosed multicentric DLBCL, MZL and FL that had undergone complete staging work-up and were treated with chemotherapy or chemo-. We developed a customized R pipeline performing a transcriptome assembly by multiple algorithms to uncover novel lncRNAs, and delineate genome-wide expression of unannotated and annotated lncRNAs. Our pipeline also included a new package for high performance system biology analysis, which detects high-scoring network biological neighborhoods to identify functional modules. Moreover, our customized pipeline quantified the expression of novel and annotated lncRNAs, allowing us to subtype DLBCLs into two main groups. The DLBCL subtypes showed statistically different survivals, indicating the potential use of lncRNAs as prognostic biomarkers in future studies.In this manuscript, we describe the methodology used to identify lncRNAs that differentiate -cell lymphoma subtypes and we interpreted the biological and clinical values of the results. We inferred the potential functions of lncRNAs to obtain a comprehensive and integrative insight that highlights their impact in this neoplasm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666238>XCL1/glypican-3 fusion gene immunization generates potent antitumor cellular immunity and enhances anti-PD1 efficacy.</a></h2><p>Cancer vaccines can amplify existing antitumor responses or prime naïve T cells to elicit effector T-cell functions in patients through immunization. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are crucial for the rejection of established tumors. We constructed XCL1-GPC3 fusion molecules as a liver cancer vaccine by linking the XCL1 chemokine to glypican-3 (GPC3), which is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cells expressing XCL1-GPC3 chemoattracted murine XCR1+CD8α+DCs and human XCR1+CD141+DCs in vitro and promoted their IL-12 production. After subcutaneous mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid injection, mXCL1-GPC3 was mainly detected in CD8α+DCs of mouse draining lymph nodes. XCL1-GPC3-targeted DCs enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell-proliferation and induced the de novo generation of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, which abolished GPC3-expressing tumor cells in mouse and human systems. We immunized a murine autochthonous liver cancer model, with a hepatitis  background, with the mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid starting six weeks, when malignant hepatocyte clusters formed, or 14 weeks, when liver tumor nodules developed, after diethylnitrosamine administration. mXcl1-GPC3 immunized mice displayed significantly inhibited tumor formation and growth compared to GPC3-immunized mice. After mXcl1-GPC3 immunization, mouse livers showed elevated production of IFNγ, granzyme , IL-18, CCL5, CXCL19, Xcl1, and increased infiltration of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, activated NK cells and NKT cells. The antitumor effects of these immune cells were further enhanced by the administration of anti-PD1. Anti-HCC effects induced by hXCL1-GPC3 were confirmed in HCC-PDX model from three patients. Thus, XCL1-GPC3 might be a promising cancer vaccine to compensate for the deficiency of the checkpoint blockades in HCC .Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525385>Towards dewetting monoclonal antibodies for therapeutical purposes.</a></h2><p>Dewetting transition - a concept borrowed from fluid mechanics - is a physiological process that takes place inside the hydrophobic pores of ion channels. This transient phenomenon causes a metastable state that forbids water molecules to cross microscopic receptor cavities. This leads to a decreased conductance, a closure of the pore and, subsequently, severe impairment of cellular performance. We suggest that artificially-provoked dewetting transition in ion channel hydrophobic pores might stand for a molecular candidate to erase detrimental organisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells. We describe a novel type of high-affinity monoclonal antibody, that: a) targets specific trans-membrane receptor structures of harmful or redundant cells; ) is equipped with lipophilic and/or hydrophobic fragments that prevent physiological water flow inside ion channels. Therefore, we achieve an artificial dewetting transition inside receptor cavities, that causes discontinuity within transmembrane ionic flows, channel blockage, and subsequent damage of morbid cells. As an example, we describe dewetting monoclonal antibodies that target the M2 channel of the Influenza A virus: they might prevent water from entering pores thus leading to virion impairment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Building on previous analyses (2) and using the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) global vaccination coverage estimates as of 2018, this report presents global, regional, and national vaccination coverage estimates and trends, including vaccination dropout rates. According to these estimates, global coverage with the first dose of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP1) remained relatively unchanged from 2010 (89%) to 2018 (90%). Global coverage with the third DTP dose (DTP3) followed a similar global trend to that of DTP1, remaining relatively consistent from 2010 (84%) to 2018 (86%) (3). Globally, 19.4 million children (14%) were not fully vaccinated in 2018, and among them, 13.5 million (70%) did not receive any DTP doses. Overall, dropout rates from DTP1 to DTP3 decreased globally from 6% in 2010 to 4% in 2018. Global coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) remained between 84% and 86% during 2010-2018. Among countries that offer a second MCV dose (MCV2) during the second year of life, coverage increased from 19% in 2007 to 54% in 2018; among countries offering MCV2 to older age groups (children aged 3-14 years), coverage also increased, from 36% in 2007 to 69% in 2018 (3). Globally, the estimated difference in coverage with MCV1 and MCV2 in 2018 was 17%. However, among new and underused vaccines, global coverage increased from 2007 to 2018 for completed series of rotavirus vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), rubella vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type  vaccine (Hib), and hepatitis  vaccine (HepB). To reach global vaccination coverage goals for vaccines recommended during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, tailored strategies that address local determinants for incomplete vaccination are needed, including targeting hard-to-reach and hard-to-vaccinate populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464681> cell depletion with rituximab in the treatment of primary Sjögren's syndrome: what have we learnt?</a></h2><p>Despite the well-established role of  cells in the pathogenesis of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), the beneficial role of -cell depletion therapy with rituximab remains elusive in this condition, contrary to other autoimmune diseases. Although early, small-scale studies showed promising results, two recent large randomised controlled trials did not meet their primary end-points. It is evident from most trials that rituximab has a positive impact on -cell numbers and activity, both in the peripheral blood and in salivary glands, but clinical outcomes vary among studies. We review here the evidence to date of -cell depletion in pSS, analysing the underlying causes for the discrepancies in different studies and their limitations. We also discuss the potential use of peripheral and salivary gland biomarkers for patient stratification and targeted patient selection. Overall, rituximab remains a plausible treatment for pSS provided future studies address the shortfalls that emerged from our current knowledge of the use of -cell depletion in this condition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659584>Clinical characteristics and long-term follow-up of seven cases of anti-GABABR encephalitis in patients of Han Chinese descent.</a></h2><p>To improve the diagnosis and treatment of anti-GABAB receptor (anti-GABABR) encephalitis and prevent misdiagnosis or non-diagnosis.We retrospectively examined the chief clinical manifestations, auxiliary examination results, treatment strategies, treatment efficacy, and long-term follow-up results of seven consecutive patients with anti-GABABR encephalitis.Epileptic seizures were the first symptom in 100% of the patients; 85.7% had memory deficit in the hospital, 42.8% had residual symptoms of cognitive impairment at discharge, and 28.6% had cognitive impairment at the end of follow-up; 71.4% of the patients had psychosis in the hospital, 57.1% had residual symptoms of psychosis at discharge, and 14.3% still had psychosis at the end of follow-up. However, the clinical symptoms (psychiatric disorders, cognitive decline) and signs (consciousness disturbance) at onset and after follow-up were not significantly different (P > 0.05). In 71.4% of the patients, anti-GABABR antibody serum levels were higher than those in the cerebrospinal fluid (especially in patients with lung cancer). Magnetic resonance imaging in 71.4% of patients indicated that the marginal lobe demonstrated encephalitis lesions. The average modified Rankin Scale score (2.0 ± 2.31) at follow-up was significantly better than that (3.86 ± 0.90) at the time of admission (P < 0.05).The clinical characteristics of anti-GABABR encephalitis were refractory epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive impairment. Multiple antiepileptic drugs are crucial for the treatment of intractable epilepsy. Clinicians should eliminate the possibility of small-cell lung cancer in patients with high anti-GABABR antibody levels.

Thus, its natural history is not well defined and treatment recommendations come from small retrospective studies. Data on managing PTFL with radiation therapy alone is particularly sparse. Here, we describe a 17 year-old male who presented in June 2017 with a slowly enlarging right-sided cervical neck mass. An initial core biopsy was performed which showed reactive follicular hyperplasia. Four months later, the mass had enlarged significantly and an excision biopsy again showed reactive follicular hyperplasia. Further excision of five cervical lymph-nodes revealed expanded follicles with attenuated mantle-zones. Follicles were composed of medium sized atypical lymphoid cells; centroblasts were increased. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated follicles with cells expressing CD20, CD10, PAX-5, OCT-2, BOB-1 and BCL-6; Cyclin D1 was negative. MIB-1 was greater than 90% in follicles. Polymerase chain reaction analysis identified a clonal -cell profile. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization did not detect t(14;18), BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangement and breaks in IRF-4/DUSP22 and MYC were not detected. These findings were in keeping with a diagnosis of PTFL. PET/CT imaging confirmed disease isolated to the right neck, but unfortunately unresectable due to anatomic location. The patient declined treatment with chemo- and was thus treated with local radiotherapy, which was well tolerated. He achieved a complete response and remains in remission six months later. In our experience, radiation therapy is a suitable treatment for PTFL when excision and/or CIT is not possible.This article is protected by copyright.

Earlier experiments we proved that gut necrosis leads to changes in the subpopulation structure of blood lymphocytes. This prompted us to determine the clinical significance of the subpopulation structure of venous blood lymphocytes in patients with acute mesenteric ischemia. The paper is based on a retrospective analysis of the results of a controlled clinical and immunological examination of 18 patients aged 62 to 78 years (control group and a group of АМI). Evaluation lymphocyte subpopulation structure was performed by the standard method of direct immunofluorescence staining of whole blood.

As one of the most poisonous toxins known and a potential bioterrosism agent, BoNT is characterized by a complex mode of action comprising: internalization, translocation and proteolytic cleavage of a substrate, which inhibits synaptic exocytotic transmitter release at neuro-muscular nerve endings leading to peripheral neuroparalysis of the skeletal and autonomic nervous systems. There are seven major serologically distinct toxinotypes (A-G) of BoNT which act on different substrates. Human botulism is generally caused by BoNT/A,  and E. Due to its extreme lethality and potential use as biological weapon, botulism remains a global public health concern. Vaccination against BoNT, although an effective strategy, remains undesirable due to the growing expectation around therapeutic use of BoNTs in various pathological conditions. This review focuses on the current approaches for botulism control by , highlighting the future challenges while the molecular underpinnings among subtypes variants and BoNT sequences found in non-clostridial species remain to be elucidated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620125>The T-cell Response to Epstein-Barr Virus-New Tricks From an Old Dog.</a></h2><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects most people and establishes life-long infection controlled by the host's immune system. The genetic stability of the virus, deep understanding of the viral antigens and immune epitopes recognized by the host's T-cell system and the fact that recent infection can be identified by the development of symptomatic infectious mononucleosis makes EBV a powerful system in which to study human immunology.

However, despite the satisfying results of monoclonal antibody treatment, only few NHL patients are permanently cured with single-agent therapies. In this context, radioimmunotherapy, the administration of radionuclides conjugated to monoclonal antibodies, is aimed to augment the single-agent efficacy of  in order to deliver targeted radiation to tumors, particularly CD20+ -cell lymphomas. Based on evidence from several trials in NHL, the radiolabeled antibodies Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals) and I-tositumomab (Bexxar, GlaxoSmithKline) received FDA approval in 2002 and 2003, respectively. However, none of the two radioimmunotherapeutic agents has been broadly applied in clinical practice. The main reason for the under-utilization of radioimmunotherapy includes economic and logistic considerations. However, concerns about potential side effects have also been raised. Driven by these developments, we performed retrospective analysis of adverse events reporting Zevalin or Bexxar, extracted from the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the World Health Organization's VigiBase repository. Our results indicate that the two radioimmunotherapeutic agents have both related and distinct side effect profiles and confirm their known toxicological considerations. Our work also suggests that computational analysis of real-world post-marketing data can provide informative clinical insights. While more prospective studies are necessary to fully characterize the efficacy and safety of radioimmunotherapy, we expect that it has not yet reached its full therapeutic potential in modern hematological oncology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642414>Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Engineered T-Cells - a New Way and Era for Lymphoma Treatment.</a></h2><p>Patients with refractory or relapsed diffuse large -cell lymphoma have a poor prognosis with the current standard of care.Chimeric antigen receptors T-cells (CAR T-cells) are functionally reprogrammed lymphocytes, which are able to recognize and kill tumor cells. We aimed to study the progress made in this area.A mini-review was achieved using the articles published in Web of Science and PubMed in the last year and the new patents made in this field. Results and future directions: The responses to CAR T-cell products axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel are encouraging; the objective response rate can reach up to 83%, and the complete response rate ranges between 40 and 58%. About half of the patients may have serious side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Current and future developments include the improvement of CAR T-cell expansion and polyfunctionality, the combined use of CAR T-cells with a fusion protein between interferon and an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, with checkpoint inhibitors or small molecule sensitizers that have apoptotic-regulatory effects.

We now report 5-year outcomes in the trial.We randomly assigned patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma to receive one of the following regimens: nivolumab (at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight) plus ipilimumab (3 mg per kilogram) every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks); nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks) plus ipilimumab-matched placebo; or ipilimumab (3 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks for four doses) plus nivolumab-matched placebo. The two primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and in the nivolumab group, as compared with the ipilimumab group.At a minimum follow-up of 60 months, the median overall survival was more than 60.0 months (median not reached) in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and 36.9 months in the nivolumab group, as compared with 19.9 months in the ipilimumab group (hazard ratio for death with nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. ipilimumab, 0.52; hazard ratio for death with nivolumab vs. ipilimumab, 0.63). Overall survival at 5 years was 52% in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and 44% in the nivolumab group, as compared with 26% in the ipilimumab group. No sustained deterioration of health-related quality of life was observed during or after treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab or with nivolumab alone. No new late toxic effects were noted.Among patients with advanced melanoma, sustained long-term overall survival at 5 years was observed in a greater percentage of patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab alone than in those who received ipilimumab alone, with no apparent loss of quality of life in the patients who received regimens containing nivolumab.

They bind to neurotransmitter receptors or membrane proteins. Antibody to NMDAR is the origin of the majority of cases of AD in children and young adults, followed by anti-LGI1 antibody for presentation in adults. The AE has increased in the last decade, with a large number of new agents described that produce mostly neurological syndromes that involve the central nervous system, with predominance of psychiatric signaling, except in children and the predominant abnormal movements, epileptic seizures and compromise of conscience. They are frequently associated with tumors in adults but in children this association is more infrecuent. All AEs respond to immunomodulatory therapy although in different measures depending on the type of antibody involved. In general, the evolution to improvement is slow and can be completed in months or even in one year or more.

Furthermore, we found that the deletion was associated with elevated APOBEC-mutational signature, neoantigen loads and relative composition of T cells (CD8+) in TILs only in breast cancer. Additionally, we also found that APOBEC-mutational signature significantly contributed to neoantigen loads and certain immune cell abundances in TILs across cancer types.These findings reveal new insights into understanding the genetic, biological and immunological mechanisms through which APOBEC genes may be involved in carcinogenesis, and provide potential genetic biomarker for the development of disease prevention and cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590901>Colostrum Management for Dairy Calves.</a></h2><p>Colostrum management is the single most important management factor in determining calf health and survival.

Herein we examine heterogeneity of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) repertoire. The number of TCR sequences selectively expanded in tumors varies within and between tumors and correlates with the number of nonsynonymous mutations. Expanded TCRs can be subdivided into TCRs found in all tumor regions (ubiquitous) and those present in a subset of regions (regional). The number of ubiquitous and regional TCRs correlates with the number of ubiquitous and regional nonsynonymous mutations, respectively. Expanded TCRs form part of clusters of TCRs of similar sequence, suggestive of a spatially constrained antigen-driven process. CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes harboring ubiquitous TCRs display a dysfunctional tissue-resident phenotype. Ubiquitous TCRs are preferentially detected in the blood at the time of tumor resection as compared to routine follow-up. These findings highlight a noninvasive method to identify and track relevant tumor-reactive TCRs for use in adoptive T cell .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560833>Increased cytoplasmatic expression of cancer immune surveillance receptor CD1d in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas.</a></h2><p>Anaplastic thyroid carcinomas are associated with rapid tumor growth, short survival time and without any promising therapy to improve the poor prognosis. In this study, expression of immunoregulative receptor CD1d and lymphocyte infiltration in different thyroid tumors as well as in healthy tissue were analyzed in order to find new targets for an immunotherapeutic approach.CD1d immunohistochemistry was performed in samples of 18 anaplastic, 17 follicular, 27 papillary, and 4 medullary thyroid carcinomas as well as in 19 specimens from normal thyroid tissue and additionally in 10 samples of sarcoma, seven malignant melanoma and three spindle-cell lung carcinoma. Furthermore, thyroid samples were stained with antibodies against CD3, CD20, CD56, CD68, and LCA in order to analyze lymphocyte infiltration.For the first time CD1d receptor expression on normal thyroid tissue could be demonstrated. Moreover, anaplastic thyroid carcinomas showed significantly higher expression levels compared to other thyroid samples. Most astonishingly, CD1d expression disappeared from the cellular surface and was detected rather in the cytoplasm of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells. In addition, histologically similar tumors to anaplastic carcinoma like sarcoma and malignant melanoma revealed distinct CD1d staining patterns. Furthermore, infiltration of T cells,  cells, and macrophages in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas was different when compared to normal thyroid tissue and all other thyroid carcinomas.Anaplastic thyroid carcinomas show significantly higher expression of CD1d, a receptor for NKT cells, which are subject of several anticancer therapy studies.

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a class of unique liver stromal cells, participate in immunomodulatory activities by inducing the apoptosis of effector T-cells, generation of regulatory T-cells, and development of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to achieve long-term survival of islet allografts. This study provides in vitro and in vivo evidences that HSCs induce the generation of MDSCs to promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression through interleukin (IL)-6 secretion. HSC-induced MDSCs highly expressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase 1 mRNA and presented potent inhibitory T-cell immune responses in the tumor environment. Wild-type HSC-induced MDSCs expressed lower levels of CD40, CD86, and MHC II, and a higher level of B7-H1 surface molecules, as well as increased the production of iNOS and arginase I compared with MDSCs induced by IL-6-deficient HSCs in vitro. A murine-transplanted model of the liver tumor showed that HCCs cotransplanted with HSCs could significantly enhance the tumor area and detect more MDSCs compared with HCCs alone or HCCs cotransplanted with HSCs lacking IL-6. In conclusion, the results indicated that MDSCs are induced mainly by HSCs through IL-6 signaling and produce inhibitory enzymes to reduce T-cell immunity and then promote HCC progression within the tumor microenvironment. Therapies targeting the pathway involved in MDSC production or its immune-modulating pathways can serve as an alternative  for HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537638>LTR retroelement expansion of the human cancer transcriptome and immunopeptidome revealed by de novo transcript assembly.</a></h2><p>Dysregulated endogenous retroelements (EREs) are increasingly implicated in the initiation, progression, and immune surveillance of human cancer. However, incomplete knowledge of ERE activity limits mechanistic studies. By using pan-cancer de novo transcript assembly, we uncover the extent and complexity of ERE transcription. The current assembly doubled the number of previously annotated transcripts overlapping with long-terminal repeat (LTR) elements, several thousand of which were expressed specifically in one or a few related cancer types. Exemplified in melanoma, LTR-overlapping transcripts were highly predictable, disease prognostic, and closely linked with molecularly defined subtypes. They further showed the potential to affect disease-relevant genes, as well as produce novel cancer-specific antigenic peptides.

The phase 1b NIBIT-M4 trial tested this hypothesis using the next-generation DHA guadecitabine combined with ipilimumab.Unresectable Stage III/IV melanoma patients received escalating doses of guadecitabine 30, 45 or 60 mg/m/day subcutaneously on Days 1-5 every 3 weeks, and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously on Day 1 every 3 weeks, starting 1 week after guadecitabine, for 4 cycles. Primary endpoints were safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose of treatment; secondary were immune-related (ir) disease control rate (DCR) and objective response rate (ORR); exploratory were changes in methylome, transcriptome, and immune contextures in sequential tumor biopsies, and pharmacokinetics.Nineteen patients were treated; 84% had grade 3/4 adverse events, neither dose limiting toxicities  protocol nor overlapping toxicities were observed. Ir-DCR and ir-ORR were 42% and 26%, respectively.

Currently, no prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines against HCV are available. We previously demonstrated the preclinical potency of therapeutic HCV vaccines based on recombinant Semliki Forest virus (SFV) replicon particles. However, clinical trials do not always meet the high expectations of preclinical studies, thus, optimization of vaccine strategies is crucial. In efforts to further increase the frequency of HCV-specific immune responses in the candidate SFV-based vaccines, the authors assessed whether inclusion of three strong, so-called universal helper T cell epitopes, and an endoplasmic reticulum localization, and retention signal (collectively termed sigHELP-KDEL cassette) could enhance HCV-specific immune responses.We included the sigHELP-KDEL cassette in two of the candidate SFV-based HCV vaccines, targeting NS3/4A and NS5A/ proteins. We characterized the new constructs  for the expression and stability of the transgene-encoded proteins. Their immune efficacy with respect to HCV-specific immune responses  was compared with the parental SFV vaccine expressing the corresponding HCV antigen. Further characterization of the functionality of the HCV-specific CD8 T cells was assessed by surface and intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry analysis.Moderate, but significantly, enhanced frequencies of antigen-specific immune responses were achieved upon lower/suboptimal dosage immunization. In optimal dosage immunization, the inclusion of the cassette did not further increase the frequencies of HCV-specific CD8 T cells when compared with the parental vaccines and the frequencies of effector and memory populations were identical.We hypothesize that the additional effect of the sigHELP-KDEL cassette in SFV-based vaccines depends on the immunogenicity, nature, and stability of the target antigen expressed by the vaccine.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587307>Induction of IgG and IgG -cell memory following sublingual  for ryegrass pollen allergy.</a></h2><p>Whilst treatment for atopic rhinitis is aimed mostly to relieve symptoms, only allergen-specific  (AIT) is targeted to modify the natural history of allergic diseases. This results in sustained clinical tolerance, even when treatment has stopped. The immunomodulatory effects of AIT are attributed mainly to increased regulatory T cell function and increased allergen-specific IgG , yet little is known about the effect on the memory  cell compartment.We aimed to examine the effects of AIT on the IgE and IgG subclass expressing memory  cells.We recruited 29 patients with atopic seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis and performed a longitudinal analysis of the peripheral immune compartment before, during and after sublingual  (SLIT) for allergy to temperate grass pollen, predominantly to ryegrass pollen (RGP; Lolium perenne). Using flow cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum immunoassays we analyzed the effects of a 4-month pre-seasonal treatment regimen comprising two or three courses in consecutive years on circulating IgE and IgG memory  cells and allergen-specific Ig levels.SLIT increased RGP-specific serum IgG and IgG , as well as the frequencies of IgG  and IgG  memory  cells, whereas no effect was observed on the IgE memory -cell compartment. Furthermore, SLIT enhanced proportions of regulatory T cells specific to RGP. These changes were associated with clinical improvement.Our data provide evidence for immunological effects of SLIT on -cell memory. Skewing responses towards IgG and IgG subclasses might be a mechanism to suppress IgE-mediated allergic responses.© 2019 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

This pilot trial investigated safety, efficacy, and immunologic activity of intratumoral delivery of IL-12 plasmid DNA (tavo) via in vivo electroporation (i.t.-tavo-EP) in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), an aggressive virus-associated skin cancer.Fifteen MCC patients with superficial injectable tumor(s) received i.t.-tavo-EP on days 1, 5, and 8 of each cycle. Patients with locoregional MCC (Cohort A, N=3) received one cycle before definitive surgery in week 4. Patients with metastatic MCC (Cohort , N=12) received up to 4 cycles total, administered at least six weeks apart. Serial tumor and blood samples were collected.All patients successfully completed at least one cycle with transient, mild (Grade 1, 2) AEs and without significant systemic toxicity. Sustained (day 22) intratumoral expression of IL-12 protein was observed along with local inflammation and increased tumor-specific CD8+ T cell infiltration, which led to systemic immunologic and clinical responses. The overall response rate was 25% (3/12) in Cohort , with two patients experiencing durable clinical benefit (16 and 55+ months respectively). Two Cohort A patients (one with pathologic complete remission) were recurrence-free at 44+ and 75+ months.I.t.-tavo-EP was safe and feasible without systemic toxicity. Sustained local expression of IL-12 protein and local inflammation led to systemic immune responses and clinically meaningful benefit in some patients.

It is an inflammatory disorder with some features of autoimmunity. It is accepted that ectopic endometriotic tissue originates from endometrial cells exfoliated during menstruation and disseminating into the peritoneum by retrograde menstrual blood flow. It is assumed that the survival of endometriotic cells in the peritoneal cavity may be partially due to their abrogated elimination by natural killer (NK) cells. The decrease of NK cell cytotoxic activity in endometriosis is associated with an increased expression of some inhibitory NK cell receptors. It may be also related to the expression of human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), a ligand for inhibitory leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily  member 1 (LILRB1) receptors. The downregulated cytotoxic activity of NK cells may be due to inhibitory cytokines present in the peritoneal milieu of patients with endometriosis. The role of NK cell receptors and their ligands in endometriosis is also confirmed by genetic association studies. Thus, endometriosis may be a subject of  by blocking NK cell negative control checkpoints including inhibitory NK cell receptors.

Here we prospectively screened the extracellular acidification rate as a measure of glycolysis and the oxygen consumption rate as a measure of mitochondrial respiration in  cells from patients with primary antibody deficiency. The highest oxygen consumption rate values were detected in three study participants with persistent polyclonal  cell lymphocytosis (PPBL). Exome sequencing identified germline mutations in SDHA, which encodes succinate dehydrogenase subunit A, in all three patients with PPBL. SDHA gain-of-function led to an accumulation of fumarate in PPBL  cells, which engaged the KEAP1-Nrf2 system to drive the transcription of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines. In a single patient trial, blocking the activity of the cytokine interleukin-6 in vivo prevented systemic inflammation and ameliorated clinical disease.

CLL cells affect the phenotype and function of the entire spectrum of innate and adaptive immune cells, including monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, leading to a tumor-supportive environment and reduced immunosurveillance. Novel immunotherapies like immune checkpoint blockade, bi- and tri-specific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells use the patients' immune system to induce therapeutic responses. Although these novel immunotherapies showed impressive results in several  cell lymphomas, responses in CLL were often disappointing. The strong immunomodulatory effect of CLL is believed to play a pivotal role in the low response rates to these immunotherapeutic strategies. In this review, we summarize how CLL influences the function of non-malignant lymphocytes, with a special focus on T and NK cells, two important cellular mediators for .

Anti-HBV prophylaxis is suggested for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients undergoing rituximab therapy, even those with resolved HBV infection. Since anti-HBV prophylaxis for patients with resolved HBV infection is not covered by national health insurance in Taiwan, a proportion of these patients receive no prophylaxis. In addition, late HBV reactivation has emerged as a new issue in recent reports, and no consensus has been reached for the optimal duration of antiviral prophylaxis. Thus, the aim of our study was to investigate the incidence and outcomes of HBV reactivation in NHL patients in a real-world setting and to study the frequency of late HBV reactivation.Non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients who received rituximab and/or chemotherapy at our institute between January 2011 and December 2015 and who were hepatitis  surface antigen (HBsAg)- or hepatitis  core antibody (HBcAb)-positive were reviewed retrospectively.A total of 388 patients were screened between January 2011 and December 2015. In total, 196 patients were excluded because HBsAg was not assessed, HBcAb was negative or not assessed, or they were not treated with immunosuppressive therapy. Finally, the retrospective study included 62 HBsAg-positive NHL patients and 130 NHL patients with resolved HBV infection (HBsAg-negative and HBcAb-positive). During a median 30.5-month follow-up period, seven patients experienced HBV reactivation, five of whom had a hepatitis flare. The incidence of HBV reactivation did not significantly differ between the HBsAg-positive patients and the resolved HBV infection population without anti-HBV prophylaxis (4.8% vs. 3.1%,  = 0.683). All patients with HBV reactivation were exposed to rituximab. Notably, late HBV reactivation was not uncommon (two of seven patients with HBV reactivation events, 28.6%). Hepatitis  virus reactivation did not influence the patients' overall survival. An age ≥65 years and an advanced disease stage were independent risk factors for poorer overall survival.The incidence of HBV reactivation was similar between the HBsAg-positive patients with antiviral prophylaxis and the resolved HBV infection population without anti-HBV prophylaxis. All HBV reactivation events occurred in NHL patients exposed to rituximab. Late reactivation was not uncommon. The duration of regular liver function monitoring for more than 1 year after immunosuppressive therapy or after withdrawal of prophylactic antiviral therapy should be prolonged. Determining the exact optimal duration of anti-HBV prophylaxis is warranted in a future prospective study for NHL patients treated with rituximab-containing therapy.© 2019 Tsai et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467839>Prognostic significance of Fc receptor-like 1 in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and various -cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</a></h2><p>Fc receptor-like 1 (FCRL1) positively regulates -cell responses and may involve in the pathogenesis of -cell malignancies.

Despite this, the full range of mediators that inhibit T-cell activation and influence anti-tumor immunity is unclear. Here, we identify the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) Rasal1 as a novel TCR-ZAP-70 binding protein that negatively regulates T-cell activation and tumor immunity. Rasal1 inhibits via two pathways, the binding and inhibition of the kinase domain of ZAP-70, and GAP inhibition of the p21-ERK pathway. It is expressed in activated CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells, and inhibits CD4 + T-cell responses to antigenic peptides presented by dendritic cells as well as CD4 + T-cell responses to peptide antigens in vivo. Furthermore, siRNA reduction of Rasal1 expression in T-cells shrinks B16 melanoma and EL-4 lymphoma tumors, concurrent with an increase in CD8 + tumor-infiltrating T-cells expressing granzyme  and interferon γ-1.

The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multi-protein complex of the innate immune system that is responsible for the production of the potent inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Tumor- associated macrophages (TAM) are an expanded population of immune cells found in the tumor microenvironment that can promote the initiation and metastasis of tumor cells. Their presence has been correlated with disease burden, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting this population. However, to date clinically relevant pharmacologic strategies to target TAM remain elusive. Here, we show that  generated TAM harbor NLRP3 inflammasome components and produce IL-1β. Ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), is in clinical use for the treatment of - cell malignancies. We report that BTK is expressed by human  generated TAM and murine macrophages and that it physically associates with the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, ibrutinib is able to inhibit BTK phosphorylation in TAM generated . Treatment of TAM with ibrutinib significantly impaired the ability of these cells to produce IL-1β. The present study provides evidence that BTK physically associates with the NLRP3 inflammasome and that inhibition of BTK with ibrutinib can impair the production of IL-1β by  generated TAM. Thus, ibrutinib could potentially be of clinical use in abrogating inflammation-associated cancer progression and the immune-suppressive effects of myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646091>Clinical impact of T cells,  cells and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in muscle invasive bladder cancer: a comparative study of transurethral resection and cystectomy specimens.</a></h2><p>In patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) prior to radical cystectomy has improved survival but there is an urgent unmet need to identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers to stratify patients who will benefit from treatment. This study aimed to examine the composition of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in MIBC, with particular reference to the clinical outcome and the potential modifying effect of NAC. To this end, the expression of CD8 and FoxP3 T cells, CD20  cells, PD-1 and PD-L1 immune cells and PD-L1 tumor cells was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays with paired transurethral resection (TURB) specimens, cystectomy specimens and lymph node metastases from 145 patients, 65 of whom had received NAC. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied to assess the impact of investigated cell subsets on time to recurrence (TTR). In cystectomy specimens, high infiltration of the investigated immune cell populations, but not PD-L1 tumor cells, were independently associated with a prolonged TTR, whereas in TURB specimens, this association was only seen for CD8 lymphocytes. An additive beneficial prognostic effect of NAC was seen for the majority of the cell subsets but there was no significant interaction between any immune marker and NAC in relation to TTR. Furthermore, no differences in cell densities prior to NAC treatment were observed between complete and non-complete responders, or pre- and posttreatment in non-complete responders. In conclusion, immune cell infiltration provides important prognostic information in both pre- and postsurgical samples of MIBC, independently of NAC.© 2019 The Author(s).

Worldwide, an estimated 257 million people are chronically infected with HBV, defined as having a positive hepatitis  surface antigen, but millions more have prior HBV exposure indicated by positive hepatitis  core antibody. Reactivation of hepatitis  implies a sudden increase in viral replication in a patient with chronic HBV infection or prior HBV exposure. Hepatitis  reactivation (HBVr) can occur spontaneously, but it is more commonly triggered by immunosuppressive therapies for cancer, immunologic diseases, or transplantation. Elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HBV-HCV co-infected individuals treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has also been identified as an important cause of HBVr. Hepatitis  virus reactivation is an underappreciated but important complication of common medical therapies that can delay treatment or result in clinical episodes of hepatitis, hepatic failure, or death. In this review factors associated with HBVr, particularly medication-related risks, will be explored. We review data involving rituximab and ofatumumab, doxorubicin, corticosteroids, tumor necrosis factor antagonists, tyrosine kinases, bortezomib, hematologic stem cell transplantation, and DAAs for HCV treatment. In addition, we will discuss screening strategies, choice of antiviral prophylaxis, and the optimal duration of therapy for HBVr.

Despite its high prevalence worldwide, no approved antifibrotic therapies exist. Omipalisib is a selective inhibitor of the PI3K/mTOR pathway that controls nutrient metabolism, growth and proliferation. It has shown antifibrotic properties in vitro. While clinical trials for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have been initiated, an in-depth preclinical evaluation is lacking. We evaluated omipalisib's effects on fibrogenesis using the ex vivo model of murine and human precision-cut tissue slices (PCTS).Murine and human liver and jejunum PCTS were incubated with omipalisib up to 10 μM for 48 h. PI3K pathway activation was assessed through protein kinase  (Akt) phosphorylation and antifibrotic efficacy was determined via a spectrum of fibrosis markers at the transcriptional and translational level.During incubation of PCTS the PI3K pathway was activated and incubation with omipalisib prevented Akt phosphorylation (IC = 20 and 1.5 nM for mouse and human, respectively). Viability of mouse and human liver PCTS was compromised only at the high concentration of 10 and 1-5 μM, respectively. However, viability of jejunum PCTS decreased with 0.1 (mouse) and 0.01 μM (human). Spontaneously increased fibrosis related genes and proteins were significantly and similarly suppressed in mouse and in human liver PCTS.Omipalisib has antifibrotic properties in ex vivo mouse and human liver PCTS, but higher concentrations showed toxicity in jejunum PCTS. While the PI3K/mTOR pathway appears to be a promising target for the treatment of liver fibrosis, PCTS revealed likely side effects in the intestine at higher doses.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

However, individual NK cells are highly heterogeneous in their cytolytic potential, making it difficult to detect, quantify and correlate the outcome of dynamic effector-target cell interactions at single cell resolution. Here, we present a microfluidic bioassay platform capable of activity-based screening of cellular and molecular immunotherapies. We identified distinct functional signatures associated with NK-MM cell interaction. The addition of immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide altered responses of NK-susceptible MM cells but not that of NK-tolerant MM cells. Antitumor cytotoxicity was significantly increased by the blockade of PD1/PDL1 axis as well as the clinically relevant cell line NK92, which were used to construct molecular logic functions (AND and NOT gates). A predictive agent-based mathematical model was developed to simulate progressive disease states and drug efficacy. The findings of the current study validate the applicability of this microfluidic cytotoxicity assay for  screening, biocomputation and for future employment in detection of patient-specific cell response for precision medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606701>CD47-targeted bismuth selenide nanoparticles actualize improved photothermal therapy by increasing macrophage phagocytosis of cancer cells.</a></h2><p>CD47, a transmembrane protein overexpressed in most tumors, limits macrophage phagocytosis by interacting with macrophage signal-regulated protein α (SIRPα). In this study, we have developed CD47-targeted bismuth selenide nanoparticles (Ab-PEG-BiSe) that increase phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages to actualize improved photothermal therapy (PTT). The functionalized nanoparticles were constructed by conjugating anti-CD47 antibody (Ab) to PEGylated bismuth selenide nanoparticles (PEG-BiSe). The anti-CD47 antibody modified on the nanoparticles enhanced the phagocytic activity of macrophages toward tumor cells by specifically blocking the crosstalk between CD47 and SIRPα. Meanwhile, Ab-PEG-BiSe showed excellent photothermal performance including strong near infrared (NIR) absorbance, high photothermal conversion efficiency and photostability, and exhibited outstanding in vitro PTT effect under NIR laser irradiation. In vivo therapeutic experiments revealed that this CD47-targeted PTT nanoagent, with the assistance of enhanced macrophage phagocytosis, achieved the goal of tumor eradication. Besides, toxicity studies confirmed that Ab-PEG-BiSe had good biocompatibility. In conclusion, Ab-PEG-BiSe may serve as an efficient PTT platform in combination with macrophage-mediated  to improve antitumor efficacy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

However, due to the lack of ideal tumor surface antigens, CAR-T cell therapy has limited success in treating solid tumors. T cells genetically engineered with T cell receptors (TCR-T cells) recognize intracellular and cell-surface antigens in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation and thus have the potential to access much more target antigens than CAR-T cells, providing great promise in treating solid tumors. There is an increasing interest in the application of TCR-T cell therapy for solid tumors, and fifty-six clinical trials are undergoing worldwide to confirm its validity. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in clinical studies of TCR-T cell therapy, describe strategies in the preparation and characterization of TCR-T cells, focusing on antigen selection, TCR isolation and methods to further enhance the potency of adoptively transferred cells.Copyright © 2019 European Federation of Immunological Societies.

Samples were collected using strict standard operating procedures including blood (serum and lymphocytes), tumor tissue (vital and snap frozen), and adjacent normal epithelium. Patient and tumor data including classification, molecular type, clinical outcome, and results of the model establishment are the essential pillars. Overall, 149 patient-derived xenografts with 34 primary and 35 secondary cell lines were successfully established and encompass all colorectal carcinoma anatomic sites, grading and staging types, and molecular classes. The HROC collection represents one of the largest model assortments from consecutive clinical colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cases worldwide. Statistical analysis identified a variety of clinicopathological and molecular factors associated with model success in univariate analysis. Several of them not identified before include localization, mutational status of K-Ras and -Raf, MSI-status, and grading and staging parameters. In a multivariate analysis model, success solely correlated positively with the nodal status N1 and mutations in the genes K-Ras and -Raf. These results imply that generating CRC tumor models on the individual patient level is worth considering especially for advanced tumor cases with a dismal prognosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623224>NK Cell-Based  for Hematological Malignancies.</a></h2><p>Natural killer (NK) lymphocytes are an integral component of the innate immune system and represent important effector cells in cancer , particularly in the control of hematological malignancies. Refined knowledge of NK cellular and molecular biology has fueled the interest in NK cell-based antitumor therapies, and recent efforts have been made to exploit the high potential of these cells in clinical practice. Infusion of high numbers of mature NK cells through the novel graft manipulation based on the selective depletion of T cells and CD19  cells has resulted into an improved outcome in children with acute leukemia given human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical hematopoietic transplantation. Likewise, adoptive transfer of purified third-party NK cells showed promising results in patients with myeloid malignancies. Strategies based on the use of cytokines or monoclonal antibodies able to induce and optimize NK cell activation, persistence, and expansion also represent a novel field of investigation with remarkable perspectives of favorably impacting on outcome of patients with hematological neoplasia.

Bothrops genus is responsible for almost 80% of snakebites in Brazil.  is the only approved specific treatment against snake toxins and the production of therapeutic antivenoms requires quality control tests to determine their neutralizing potency. Currently, these controls are performed by in vivo lethality neutralization, however, the inhibition of particular events produced by bothropic venoms such as coagulopathy, hemorrhage, edema or cytotoxic effects are also required. The aim of this work is to develop an in vitro alternative assay for antivenom pre-clinical evaluation. In this sense, we designed a cell viability assay using different amounts (0.2-10 μL/well) of low and high potency anti-bothropic sera, previously classified by the traditional in vivo test, for assessing the antivenom capacity to protect the cells against . jararaca venom cytotoxicity (5xEC = 58.95 μg/mL). We found that high potency sera are more effective in neutralizing . jararaca venom cytotoxicity when compared to low potency sera, which is in accordance to their pre-determined in vivo potency. Considering sera in vitro inhibitory concentration able to prevent 50% cell death (IC) and their known in vivo potency, a cut-off point was determined to discriminate low and high potency sera. Our data provide insights for the development of an in vitro method which can determine the anti-bothropic antivenom potency during its production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The development of autoimmunity is associated with innate immune responses where the prominent role plays Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between the expression levels of TLR-2 and TLR-4 on CD4+ and CD8+ T as well as CD19+  lymphocytes in patients with GD and selected clinical parameters. The study group consisted of 32 women with GD, the control group consisted of 20 healthy women. Immunophenotyping was performed using the flow cytometry and cytokines concentrations were assessed using ELISA assay. The mean percentage of CD4+/TLR-2+ and CD8+/TLR-2+ T cells in patients with GD was higher than in the control group ( < 0.0001). After obtaining euthyroidism, the mean percentage of CD4+/TLR-2+ T cells in patients with GD decreased ( < 0.0001). The expression level of TLR-2 on CD4+ T lymphocytes correlated with serum FT3 concentration in patients with GD ( = 0.47,  = 0.007). The mean percentage of CD8+/TLR-2+ T cells in patients with GD before treatment compared to patients with GD after obtaining euthyroidism was higher ( = 0.0163). Similar findings were found for TLR-4.

Here, we show that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) expression during early phases of ex vivo generation of lymphoid progenitors suppressed BCL11B, leading to suppression of T cell-associated gene expression and acquisition of NK cell-like properties. Upon adoptive transfer into hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, CAR-expressing lymphoid progenitors differentiated into CAR-induced killer (CARiK) cells that mediated potent antigen-directed antileukemic activity even across MHC barriers.

Previously, we demonstrated that an EHV-1 strain of the neuropathogenic genotype, T953, downregulates the IFN-β response  in equine endothelial cells (EECs) at 12 h post-infection (hpi). In the current study, we explored the molecular correlates of this inhibition as clues towards an understanding of the mechanism. Data from our study revealed that EHV-1 infection of EECs significantly reduced both TLR3 and TLR4 mRNA expression at 6 hpi and 12 hpi. While EHV-1 was able to significantly reduce IRF9 mRNA at both 6 hpi and 12 hpi, the virus significantly reduced IRF7 mRNA only at 12 hpi. EHV-1 did not alter the cellular level of JAK1 at any time point. However, EHV-1 reduced the cellular level of expression of TYK2 at 12 hpi. Downstream of the JAK1-TYK2 signaling EHV-1 blocked the phosphorylation and activation of STAT2 when co-incubated with exogenous IFN, at 12 hpi, although not at 3 or 6 hpi. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that the virus prevented the nuclear translocation of STAT2 molecules confirming the virus-mediated inhibition of STAT2 activation. The pattern of suppression of phosphorylation of STAT2 by EHV-1 implicated viral late gene expression. These data help illuminate how EHV-1 strategically inhibits the host innate immune defense by limiting steps required for type-I IFN sensitization and induction. To date, no commercial vaccine label has a claim to be fully protective against the diseases caused by EHV-1, especially the neurologic form. The interferon (IFN) system, of which type-I IFN is of great importance, still remains a viable immunotherapeutic option against EHV-1 infection. The type-I IFN system has been exploited successfully to treat other viral infections such as chronic hepatitis  and C in humans. The current state of research on how EHV-1 interferes with the protective effect of type-I IFN has indicated transient induction of type-I IFN production followed by a rapid shut-down  in EECs. The significance of our study is the identification of certain steps in the type-I IFN signaling pathway targeted for inhibition by EHV-1. Understanding this pathogen-host relationship is essential for the long-term goal of developing effective  against EHV-1.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578302>Autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for neuromyelitis optica.</a></h2><p>To determine if autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) could be a salvage therapy for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).Thirteen patients were enrolled in a prospective open-label cohort study (11 NMOSD aquaporin-4-immunoglobulin G [AQP4-IgG]-positive, 1 NMOSD without AQP4, and 1 NMOSD AQP4-IgG-positive with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]). Following stem cell mobilization with cyclophosphamide (2 g/m) and filgrastim, patients were treated with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) divided as 50 mg/kg IV on day -5 to day -2, rATG (thymoglobulin) given IV at 0.5 mg/kg on day -5, 1 mg/kg on day -4, and 1.5 mg/kg on days -3, -2, and -1 (total dose 6 mg/kg), and rituximab 500 mg IV on days -6 and +1. Unselected peripheral blood stem cells were infused on day 0. AQP4-IgG antibody status was determined by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-validated ELISA or flow cytometry assays. Cell-killing activity was measured using a flow cytometry-based complement assay.Median follow-up was 57 months. The patient with coexistent SLE died of complications of active lupus 10 months after HSCT. For the 12 patients with NMOSD without other active coexisting autoimmune diseases, 11 patients are more than 5 years post-transplant, and 80% are relapse-free off all immunosuppression ( < 0.001).

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and infection are the most common adverse events during CAR T-cell therapy. Similar clinical presentation of concurrent CRS and infection makes it difficult to differentially diagnose and timely treat the condition.We analyzed the features of infection events during the first 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion (CTI) in 109 patients from three clinical trials (ChiCTR-OPN-16008526, ChiCTR-OPC-16009113, ChiCTR-OPN-16009847). Based on the dynamic changes of interleukin (IL)-6 and ferritin, we proposed the "double peaks of IL-6" pattern as a feature of life-threatening infection during the first 30 days after CTI. Meanwhile, we screened candidate biomarkers from 70-biomarker panel to establish a prediction model for life-threatening infection.In this study, 19 patients (17.4%) experienced a total of 19 infection events during the first 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion. Eleven patients (10.1%) had grade 4-5 infection, which were all bacterial infection and predominantly sepsis (N = 9). "Double peaks of IL-6" appeared in 9 out of 11 patients with life-threatening infection. The prediction model of three-cytokines (IL-8, IL-1β and interferon-γ) could predict life-threatening infection with high sensitivity (training: 100.0%; validation: 100.0%) and specificity (training: 97.6%; validation: 82.8%).

Therefore, it is urgently needed to explore other suitable antigens targeted by CAR-T cells to cure  cell lymphoma. Igβ is a component of the  cell receptor (BCR) complex, which is highly expressed on the surface of lymphoma cells. In this study, we engineered T cells to express anti-Igβ CAR with CD28 costimulatory signaling moiety and observed that Igβ-CAR T cells could efficiently recognize and eliminate Igβ lymphoma cells both in vitro and in two different lymphoma xenograft models. The specificity of Igβ-CAR T cells was further confirmed through wild type or mutated Igβ gene transduction together with Igβ-specific knockout in target cells. Of note, both the in vitro and in vivo effect of Igβ CAR-T cells was comparable with that of CD19 CAR-T cells. Importantly, Igβ CAR-T cells recognized and eradicated patient-derived lymphoma cells in the autologous setting. Lastly, the safety of anti-Igβ CAR-T cells could be further enhanced by introduction of the inducible caspase-9 suicide gene system.

It affects both children and adolescents, most commonly females, and its clinical manifestations are quite variable. JAIH is progressive in nature and if left untreated may lead to cirrhosis and terminal liver failure. Although JAIH was first described almost 50 years ago, there have been few significant advances in the clinical management of these patients, both in terms of available diagnostic tools and therapeutic options. Aminotransferase activity, class G immunoglobulins and autoantibodies are the biomarkers used to diagnose AIH and monitor treatment response alongside clinical and histological findings. Despite their utility and cost-effectiveness, these biomarkers are neither an accurate expression of AIH pathogenic mechanism nor a precise measure of treatment response. Current standard of care is mainly based on the administration of steroids and azathioprine. This combination of drugs has been proven effective in inducing remission of disease in the majority of patients dramatically improving their survival; however, it not only fails to restore tolerance to hepatic autoantigens, but it also does not halt disease progression in some patients, it is often needed life-long and finally, it has deleterious side-effects. The ideal therapy should be enough selective to contrast immune-mediated live damage while preserving or potentiating the ability to develop permanent tolerance vs. pathogenic autoantigens.

In particular, it remains unexplored how driver mutations could be associated with distinct TIBs signatures and their role in tumor microenvironment.Here we analyzed associations of immunoglobulin isotypes and clonality with survival in TCGA RNA-Seq data for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), stratifying patients into 12 driver mutation and phenotypic tumor subgroups.We revealed several unexpected associations between TIBs behavior and prognosis. Abundance and high proportion of IgG1 isotype, and low proportion of IgA among all intratumorally produced immunoglobulins were specifically associated with improved overall survival for KRAS but not KRAS LUAD, revealing the first link between a driver mutation and -cell response. We found specific IgG1 signature associated with long survival, which suggests that particular specificities of IgG1+ TIBs could be beneficial in KRAS LUAD. In contrast to our previous observations for melanoma, highly clonal IgG1 production by plasma cells had no meaningful effect on prognosis, suggesting that IgG1+ TIBs may exert a beneficial effect in KRAS cases in an alternative way, such as efficient presentation of cognate antigens or direct  cell attack on tumor cells. Notably, a high proportion of the IgG1 isotype is positively correlated with the non-silent mutation burden both in the general LUAD cohort and in most patient subgroups, supporting a role for IgG1 TIBs in antigen presentation. Complementing the recent finding that the presence of stromal IgG4-producing cells is associated with a favorable prognosis for patients with stage I squamous cell carcinoma, we show that the abundance of IgG4-producing TIBs likewise has a strong positive effect on overall survival in STK11 and proximal proliferative subgroups of LUAD patients. We hypothesize that the positive role of IgG4 antibodies in some of the lung cancer subtypes could be associated with reported inability of IgG4 isotype to form immune complexes, thus preventing immunosuppression via activation of the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) phenotype.We discover prominent and distinct associations between TIBs antibody isotypes and survival in lung adenocarcinoma carrying specific driver mutations. These findings indicate that particular types of tumor-immunity relations could be beneficial in particular driver mutation context, which should be taken into account in developing strategies of cancer  and combination therapies. Specificity of protective  cell populations in specific cancer subgroups could become a clue to efficient targeted immunotherapies for appropriate cohorts of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540528>Effects of Tocilizumab, an Anti-Interleukin-6 Receptor Antibody, on Serum Lipid and Adipokine Levels in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.</a></h2><p>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dyslipidemia is a known adverse effect of tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody used in RA treatment. We aimed to assess the effect of TCZ on lipid profile and adipokine levels in RA patients. Height, weight, disease activity scores, lipid profile and atherogenic indices (AI), leptin, adiponectin, resistin, interleukin-6, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured before and four months after initiation of TCZ in 40 RA patients and 40 healthy controls. Following TCZ treatment, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides were significantly elevated, but no significant changes in weight, body mass index (BMI), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and AI were observed. Compared with controls, significantly higher adiponectin levels were measured in the RA group at baseline. Following TCZ treatment, resistin levels and the leptin-to-adiponectin ratio increased, adiponectin levels decreased, and leptin levels remained unchanged. No correlation was found between the change in adipokine serum levels and changes in the disease activity indices, nor the lipid profile.

With over 350 million people affected worldwide, HBV infection remains the leading cause of liver cancer. This is a major concern, especially in developing countries. Failure of the immune system to mount an effective response against HBV leads to chronic infection. Although HBV vaccine is present and novel antiviral medicines are being created, eradication of virus-reservoir cells remains a major health topic. Described here is a method for the generation of viral antigen (Ag) -specific CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (i.e., iPSC-CTLs), which have the ability to suppress HBV replication. HBV replication is efficiently induced in mice through hydrodynamic injection of an HBV expression plasmid, pAAV/HBV1.2, into the liver. Then, HBV surface Ag-specific mouse iPSC-CTLs are adoptively transferred, which greatly suppresses HBV replication in the liver and blood as well as prevents HBV surface Ag expression in hepatocytes. This method demonstrates HBV replication in mice after hydrodynamic injection and that stem cell-derived viral Ag-specific CTLs can suppress HBV replication. This protocol provides a useful method for HBV .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496178>[Update of the 2019 Swiss immunization schedule 7 new recommendations and review of practical implications for health professionals].</a></h2><p>The Swiss 2019 immunization schedule published includes 7 news clauses: 1) DTPa-IPV-Hib-HBV vaccination in newborns with the simplified dosing schedule "2+1"; 2) recommendation for vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella administered at 9 and 12 months of age; 3) pneumococcal immunization in children under 5 years of age as a basic recommendation; 4) replacement of the monovalent capsular group C meningococcal conjugate vaccine by the quadrivalent ACWY conjugate vaccine (Menveo); 5) extension of vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis virus to the entire Swiss territory - with the exception of the cantons of Geneva and Tessin - in people with risk factors for contagion; 6) replacement of Gardasil® with Gardasil 9® since January 2019; 7) recommendation for vaccination against hepatitis  in newborns.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544770>Proteins mimicking epitope of HIV-1 virus neutralizing antibody induce virus-neutralizing sera in mice.</a></h2><p>The development of an effective vaccine preventing HIV-1 infection is hindered by the enormous antigenic variability and unique biochemical and immunological properties of HIV-1 Env glycoprotein, the most promising target for HIV-1 neutralizing antibody. Functional studies of rare elite neutralizers led to the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies.We employed a highly complex combinatorial protein library derived from a 5 kDa albumin-binding domain scaffold, fused with support protein of total 38 kDa, to screen for binders of broadly neutralizing antibody VRC01 paratope. The most specific binders were used for immunization of experimental mice to elicit Env-specific antibodies and to test their neutralization activity using a panel of HIV-1 clade C and  pseudoviruses.Three most specific binders designated as VRA017, VRA019, and VRA177 exhibited high specificity to VRC01 antibody. Immunized mice produced Env-binding antibodies which neutralize eight of twelve HIV-1 Tier 2 pseudoviruses. Molecular modelling revealed a shape complementarity between VRA proteins and a part of VRC01 gp120 interacting surface.This strategy based on the identification of protein replicas of broadly neutralizing antibody paratope represents a novel approach in HIV-1 vaccine development. This approach is not affected by low immunogenicity of neutralization-sensitive epitopes, variability, and unique biochemical properties of HIV-1 Env used as a crucial antigen in the majority of contemporary tested vaccines.

Although tumor responses to MEK inhibition are rarely durable, MEK inhibitors have shown substantial activity and durable tumor regressions when combined with systemic immunotherapies in preclinical models of RAS-driven tumors. MEK inhibitors have been shown to potentiate anti-tumor T cell immunity, but little is known about the effects of MEK inhibition on other immune subsets, including  cells. We show here that treatment with a MEK inhibitor reduces  regulatory cells (Bregs) in vitro, and reduces the number of Bregs in tumor draining lymph nodes in a colorectal cancer model in vivo. MEK inhibition does not impede anti-tumor humoral immunity, and  cells contribute meaningfully to anti-tumor immunity in the context of MEK inhibitor therapy. Treatment with a MEK inhibitor is associated with improved T cell infiltration and an enhanced response to anti-PD1 . Together these data indicate that MEK inhibition may reduce Bregs while sparing anti-tumor  cell function, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582086>Galactan isolated from Cantharellus cibarius modulates antitumor immune response by converting tumor-associated macrophages toward M1-like phenotype.</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with an M2-like phenotype have been linked to the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Resetting tumor-associated macrophages represents an attractive target for an effective cancer . WCCP-N-, a novel linear 3-O-methylated galactan, isolated from Cantharellus cibarius, can convert tumor-promoting M2-like macrophages to tumor-inhibiting M1-like phenotype. On a cellular mechanistic level, WCCP-N- inhibited M2-like macrophages polarization through suppression of STAT6 activation. Furthermore, WCCP-N- increased the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and degradation of Iκ-α through targeting Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). The activation of MAPKs and degradation of Iκ-α were responsible for converting M2-like macrophages to M1-like macrophages. Importantly, cell culture supernatants of WCCP-N--treated M2-like macrophages could inhibit the cell viability of B16F1 and B16F10.

These results have led to the regulatory approval of two CAR T cell approaches. Translation of this result to the solid tumor setting has been problematic until now. A number of differences between liquid and solid tumors are likely to cause this discrepancy. The main ones of these are undoubtedly the uncomplicated availability of the target cell within the blood compartment and the abundant expression of the target molecule on the cancerous cells in the case of hematological malignancies. Targets expressed by solid tumor cells are hard to engage due to the non-adhesive and abnormal vasculature, while conditions in the tumor microenvironment can be extremely immunosuppressive. Targets in the tumor vasculature are readily reachable by CAR T cells and reside outside the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. It is therefore hypothesized that targeting CAR T cells towards the tumor vasculature of solid tumors may share the excellent effects of CAR T cell therapy with that against hematological malignancies. A few reports have shown promising results. Suggestions are provided for further improvement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487464>Intracellular Photothermal Delivery for Suspension Cells Using Sharp Nanoscale Tips in Microwells.</a></h2><p>Efficient intracellular delivery of biomolecules into cells that grow in suspension is of great interest for biomedical research, such as for applications in cancer . Although tremendous effort has been expended, it remains challenging for existing transfer platforms to deliver materials efficiently into suspension cells. Here, we demonstrate a high-efficiency photothermal delivery approach for suspension cells using sharp nanoscale metal-coated tips positioned at the edge of microwells, which provide controllable membrane disruption for each cell in an array. Self-aligned microfabrication generates a uniform microwell array with three-dimensional nanoscale metallic sharp tip structures. Suspension cells self-position by gravity within each microwell in direct contact with eight sharp tips, where laser-induced cavitation bubbles generate transient pores in the cell membrane to facilitate intracellular delivery of extracellular cargo. A range of cargo sizes were tested on this platform using Ramos suspension  cells with an efficiency of >84% for Calcein green (0.6 kDa) and >45% for FITC-dextran (2000 kDa), with retained viability of >96% and a throughput of >100 000 cells delivered per minute.

However, how to pre-judge which patients are suitable for immune checkpoint inhibitor is a difficult problem. We use the existing public bioinformatics database to comprehensively analyze the relationship between clinical data of various cancers with immune checkpoint blocking molecules and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and try to find the potential predictive value of lncRNA for  with checkpoint inhibitors. In this study, we found that: (a) high expression of lncRNA MIR155 host gene (MIR155HG) was closely related to better overall survival (OS) in cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), and have better disease-free survival (DFS) in CHOL. Meanwhile, the high level of MIR155HG was associated with poorer OS in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), and uveal melanoma (UVM). () The expression of MIR155HG was significantly correlated with infiltrating levels of immune cells and immune molecules, especially with immune checkpoint molecules such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) in most kinds of cancers. (c) Detection of clinical CHOL and liver hepatocellular carcinoma tissues confirmed that there was a strong positive correlation between MIR155HG expression and the levels of CTLA4 and PD-L1. MIR155 host gene can be used as a prognostic marker in multiple cancers, and of great value in predicting the curative effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy owing to it is closely related with immune cells infiltration and immune checkpoint molecules expression.© 2019 The Authors.

We aimed to evaluate the frequency of reduced immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations and its association with  and disease course in two independent MS cohorts.In our retrospective cross-sectional study, MS patients and control patients with head or neck pain from Bern University Hospital (Bern, Switzerland) and Eginition University Hospital (Athens, Greece) were included. The lower limits of normal (LLN) for serum Ig concentration were IgG < 700 mg/dl, IgM < 40 mg/dl, and IgA < 70 mg/dl. Mann-Whitney  test, analysis of variance test, and multiple linear regression analysis were employed.In total, 327 MS patients were retrospectively identified (Bern/Athens:  = 226/101). Serum IgG concentrations were frequently under LLN in both MS cohorts (Bern/Athens: 15.5%/14.9%), even when considering only untreated patients (Bern/Athens: 7.9%/8.6%). MS patients ( = 327) were significantly more likely to have IgG concentrations below LLN and below 600 mg/dl in comparison with controls ( = 58) ( = 0.015 and 0.047, respectively). Between both patient groups, no significant differences were found in frequencies of IgA and IgM concentrations under LLN [ (MS patients/controls): IgA 203/30, IgM 224/24]. Independently of age, secondary progressive MS patients had lower IgG concentrations than relapsing-remitting and primary progressive patients (both:  ⩽ 0.01). After adjusting for sex, age, and disease course, IgG concentrations were lower in patients treated with rituximab ( = 0.001;  = 42/327), intravenous corticosteroids ( < 0.001;  = 16/327), natalizumab ( < 0.001;  = 48/327), and fingolimod ( = 0.003;  = 6/327).Our study demonstrated high prevalence rates of reduced serum IgG concentrations in MS patients with and without disease-modifying treatments. The significance of lower IgG concentrations at the levels noted is unclear considering that infections or interference with antibody production generally occur when IgG levels are much lower, at or below 400 mg/dl. However, the information is useful to monitor IgG levels especially with anti--cell therapies and consider IgG substitution when levels drop below 400 mg/dl.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577647>Clinicopathological Features and Outcomes in Lymphoma of Extraocular Muscles.</a></h2><p>To describe the clinicopathological features and report the outcomes of treatment in lymphoma involving the extraocular muscles (EOM), the largest reported case-series.A retrospective case series of patients with lymphoma involving the EOM from a single tertiary referral orbital center, between March 1992 and March 2018. Patients with other histopathologic diagnoses or who did not have an EOM biopsy were excluded. The main outcome measures were histologic evaluation and clinical follow-up including tumor response, recurrence, and survival.Twenty-five patients were included, 16 female; 9 male; median age 64.7 years (range 33.8-92.6 years). Unilateral involvement was present in 23 cases (92%). Lymphoma was found to be primary in 15 patients (60%), and any EOM could be affected by disease. Fourteen patients (56%) displayed impaired duction in the direction of the affected muscle. The commonest histologic type was extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in 16 cases (64%) followed by follicular lymphoma in 3 cases (12%), diffuse large -cell lymphoma in 2 cases (8%), gamma delta T-cell lymphoma in 2 cases (8%), small lymphocytic lymphom and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in 1 case each (4%). All 4 patients with high-grade lymphomas (diffuse large -cell or T cell lymphoma) were found to have systemic disease. Patients were treated with combinations of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or , with low toxicity. Two patients developed treatment-related complications. With a median follow-up of 26 months (range 3-108 months), there was only 1 recurrence, which was successfully salvaged with Rituximab, and no deaths due to lymphoma.Lymphoma of the EOM is a rare tumor with good response to treatment, few treatment-related complications and low risk of recurrence or mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533777>Oral metronomic vinorelbine combined with endocrine therapy in hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer: SOLTI-1501 VENTANA window of opportunity trial.</a></h2><p>The biological effect of oral metronomic vinorelbine (mVNB) alone or in combination with endocrine therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2-negative breast cancer has been scarcely addressed.Postmenopausal women with untreated stage I-III HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer were randomized (1:1:1) to receive 3 weeks of letrozole (LTZ) 2.5 mg/day, oral mVNB 50 mg 3 days/week, or the combination. The primary objective was to evaluate, within PAM50 Luminal A/ disease, if the anti-proliferative effect of LTZ+mVNB was superior to monotherapy. An anti-proliferative effect was defined as the mean relative decrease of the PAM50 11-gene proliferation score in combination arm vs. both monotherapy arms. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of a comprehensive panel of breast cancer-related genes and safety. An unplanned analysis of stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) was also performed. PAM50 analyses were performed using the nCounter®-based Breast Cancer 360™ gene panel, which includes 752 genes and 32 signatures.Sixty-one patients were randomized, and 54 paired samples (89%) were analyzed. The main patient characteristics were mean age of 67, mean tumor size of 1.7 cm, mean Ki67 of 14.3%, stage I (55.7%), and grades 1-2 (90%). Most baseline samples were PAM50 Luminal A (74.1%) or  (22.2%). The anti-proliferative effect of 3 weeks of LTZ+mVNB (- 73.2%) was superior to both monotherapy arms combined (- 49.9%; p = 0.001) and mVNB (- 19.1%; p < 0.001). The anti-proliferative effect of LTZ+mVNB (- 73.2%) was numerically higher compared to LTZ (- 65.7%) but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.328). LTZ+mVNB induced high expression of immune-related genes and gene signatures, including CD8 T cell signature and PDL1 gene and low expression of ER-regulated genes (e.g., progesterone receptor) and cell cycle-related and DNA repair genes. In tumors with ≤ 10% sTILs at baseline, a statistically significant increase in sTILs was observed following LTZ (paired analysis p = 0.049) and LTZ+mVNB (p = 0.012). Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 3.4% of the cases.Short-term mVNB is well-tolerated and presents anti-proliferative activity alone and in combination with LTZ. The high expression of immune-related biological processes and sTILs observed with the combination opens the possibility of studying this combination with .

PD-L1-expressing APCs rather than tumor cells demonstrated the essential anti-tumor effects of anti-PD-L1 monotherapy in preclinical tumor models. Using the murine tumor model, we investigated whether anti-PD-L1 antibody increased the antigen-specific immune response and anti-tumor effects induced by the antigen-specific protein vaccine, as well as the possible mechanisms regarding activation of APCs. Anti-PD-L1 antibody combined with the PEK protein vaccine generated more potent E7-specific immunity (including the number and cytotoxic activity of E7-specific cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes) and anti-tumor effects than protein vaccine alone. Anti-PD-L1 antibody enhanced the maturation of dendritic cells and the proportion of M1-like macrophages in tumor-draining lymph nodes and tumors in tumor-bearing mice treated with combinatorial therapy. PD-L1 blockade overturned the immunosuppressive status of the tumor microenvironment and then enhanced the E7 tumor-specific antigen-specific immunity and anti-tumor effects generated by an E7-specific protein vaccine through modulation of APCs in an E7-expressing small tumor model. Tumor-specific antigen (like HPV E7 antigen)-specific  combined with APC-targeting modality by PD-L1 blockade has a high translational potential in E7-specific cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547237>Cx43-Gap Junctions Accumulate at the Cytotoxic Immunological Synapse Enabling Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Melanoma Cell Killing.</a></h2><p>Upon tumor antigen recognition, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and target cells form specialized supramolecular structures, called cytotoxic immunological synapses, which are required for polarized delivery of cytotoxic granules. In previous reports, we described the accumulation of connexin 43 (Cx43)-formed gap junctions (GJs) at natural killer (NK) cell-tumor cell cytotoxic immunological synapse. In this report, we demonstrate the functional role of Cx43-GJs at the cytotoxic immunological synapse established between CTLs and melanoma cells during cytotoxicity. Using confocal microscopy, we evaluated Cx43 polarization to the contact site between CTLs isolated from pMEL-1 mice and B16F10 melanoma cells. We knocked down Cx43 expression in B16F10 cells and evaluated its role in the formation of functional GJs and the cytotoxic activity of CTLs, by calcein transfer and granzyme  activity assays, respectively. We found that Cx43 localizes at CTL/B16F10 intercellular contact sites via an antigen-dependent process. We also found that pMEL-1 CTLs but not wild-type naïve CD8 T cells established functional GJs with B16F10 cells. Interestingly, we observed that Cx43-GJs were required for an efficient granzyme  activity in target B16F10 cells. Using an HLA-A2-restricted/MART-1-specific CD8 T-cell clone, we confirmed these observations in human cells. Our results suggest that Cx43-channels are relevant components of cytotoxic immunological synapses and potentiate CTL-mediated tumor cell killing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511071>Niclosamide, an antihelmintic drug, enhances efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade in non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has received approval for clinical application due to its encouraging benefit with improving prognosis in selected populations. Unfortunately, the response to  for many patients remains unsatisfactory. It remains a great challenge to generate potential combinations that will outperform single agents alone with regard to anti-tumor activity.Using NSCLC cell lines and mouse models, we explored the effects of combined niclosamide and PD-L1 blockade on tumor growth and T cell function. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between PD-L1 and p-STAT3 expression in tumor samples from patients with NSCLC using IHC, as well as their relationship to patient survival.In vitro, niclosamide, an antihelmintic drug, enhanced the cancer cell lysis mediated by T cells in the presence of PD-L1 blockade. Accordingly, mice treated with niclosamide and PD-L1 antibody showed significant delay in tumor growth and increased survival which were associated with the increase of tumor infiltrating T cells and granzyme  release. Importantly, we found niclosamide could decrease the expression of PD-L1 in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner in NSCLC cells, which was linked to the blockage of p-STAT3 binding to the promoter of PD-L1.An enhancement of PD-L1 antibody by niclosamide was observed in inhibition of NSCLC growth in vitro and in vivo, which was involved in blockage of p-STAT3 binding to promoter of PD-L1 and finally downregulation of PD-L1 expression. These encourage the combination therapy of niclosamide and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade to be further studied in clinic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611142>The immunobiology of autoimmune encephalitides.</a></h2><p>Autoimmune encephalitides, with an estimated incidence of 1.5 per million population per year, although described only 15 years ago, have already had a remarkable impact in neurology and paved the field to autoimmune neuropsychiatry. Many patients traditionally presented with aberrant behavior, especially of acute or subacute onset, and treated with anti-psychotic therapies, turn out to have a CNS autoimmune disease with pathogenic autoantibodies against synaptic antigens responding to immunotherapies. The review describes the clinical spectrum of these disorders, and the pathogenetic role of key autoantibodies directed against: a) cell surface synaptic antigens and receptors, including NMDAR, GABAa, GABAb, AMPA and glycine receptors; ) channels such as AQP4 water-permeable channel or voltage-gated potassium channels; c) proteins that stabilize voltage-gated potassium channel complex into the membrane, like the LGI1 and CASPR2; and d) enzymes that catalyze the formation of neurotransmitters such as Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD). These antibodies, effectively target excitatory or inhibitory synapses in the limbic system, basal ganglia or brainstem altering synaptic function and resulting in uncontrolled neurological excitability disorder clinically manifested with psychosis, agitation, behavioral alterations, depression, sleep disturbances, seizure-like phenomena, movement disorders such as ataxia, chorea and dystonia, memory changes or coma. Some of the identified triggering factors include: viruses, especially herpes simplex, accounting for the majority of relapses occurring after viral encephalitis, which respond to  rather than antiviral agents; tumors especially teratoma, SCLC and thymomas; and biological cancer therapies (immune-check-point inhibitors). As anti-synaptic antibodies persist after viral infections or tumor removal, augmentation of autoreactive  cells which release autoantigens to draining lymph nodes, molecular mimicry and infection-induced bystander immune activation products play a role in autoimmunization process or perpetuating autoimmune neuroinflammation. The review stresses the importance of early detection, clinical recognition, proper antibody testing and early therapy initiation as these disorders, regardless of a known or not trigger, are potentially treatable responding to systemic  with intravenous steroids, IVIg, rituximab or even bortezomid.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

At 22 years of age, GLK was initially cloned and identified as an upstream activator of the MAPK JNK under an environmental stress and proinflammatory cytokines. The data derived from GLK-overexpressing or shRNA-knockdown cell lines suggest that GLK may be involved in cell proliferation through mTOR signaling. GLK phosphorylates the transcription factor TFEB and retains TFEB in the cytoplasm, leading to inhibition of cell autophagy. After generating and characterizing GLK-deficient mice, the important in vivo roles of GLK in T-cell activation were revealed. In T cells, GLK directly interacts with and activates PKCθ through phosphorylating PKCθ at Ser-538 residue, leading to activation of IKK/NF-κ. Thus, GLK-deficient mice display impaired T-cell-mediated immune responses and decreased inflammatory phenotypes in autoimmune disease models. Consistently, the percentage of GLK-overexpressing T cells is increased in the peripheral blood from autoimmune disease patients; the GLK-overexpressing T cell population is correlated with disease severity of patients. The pathogenic mechanism of autoimmune disease by GLK overexpression was unraveled by characterizing T-cell-specific GLK transgenic mice and using biochemical analyses. GLK overexpression selectively promotes IL-17A transcription by inducing the AhR-RORγt complex in T cells. In addition, GLK overexpression in cancer tissues is correlated with cancer recurrence of human lung cancer and liver cancer; the predictive power of GLK overexpression for cancer recurrence is higher than that of pathologic stage. GLK directly phosphorylates and activates IQGAP1, resulting in induction of Cdc42-mediated cell migration and cancer metastasis. Furthermore, treatment of GLK inhibitor reduces disease severity of mouse autoimmune disease models and decreases IL-17A production of human autoimmune T cells. Due to the inhibitory function of HPK1/MAP4K1 in T-cell activation and the promoting effects of GLK on tumorigenesis, HPK1 and GLK dual inhibitors could be useful therapeutic drugs for cancer . In addition, GLK deficiency results in extension of lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice. Taken together, targeting MAP4K3 (GLK) may be useful for treating/preventing autoimmune disease, cancer metastasis/recurrence, and aging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466401>Glycan-Modified Apoptotic Melanoma-Derived Extracellular Vesicles as Antigen Source for Anti-Tumor Vaccination</a></h2><p>Tumors that lack T cell infiltration are less likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibition and could benefit from cancer vaccination for the initiation of anti-tumor T cell responses. An attractive vaccine strategy is in vivo targeting of dendritic cells (DCs), key initiators of antigen-specific T cell responses. In this study we generated tumor-derived apoptotic extracellular vesicles (ApoEVs), which are potentially an abundant source of tumor-specific neo-antigens and other tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), and which can be manipulated to express DC-targeting ligands for efficient antigen delivery. Our data demonstrates that by specifically modifying the glycocalyx of tumor cells, high-mannose glycans can be expressed on their cell surface and on extracellular vesicles derived after the induction of apoptosis. High-mannose glycans are the natural ligands of dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), a dendritic cell associated C-type lectin receptor (CLR), which has the ability to efficiently internalize its cargo and direct it to both major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I and MHC-II pathways for the induction of CD8 and CD4 T cell responses, respectively. Compared to unmodified ApoEVs, ApoEVs carrying DC-SIGN ligands are internalized to a higher extent, resulting in enhanced priming of tumor-specific CD8 T cells. This approach thus presents a promising vaccination strategy in support of T cell-based  of cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31549347>Gut Microbiome in Psoriasis is Perturbed Differently During Secukinumab and Ustekinumab Therapy and Associated with Response to Treatment.</a></h2><p> could change the complex host-microbial interactions.

The relative abundance of family Pseudomonadaceae, family Enterobacteriaceae and order Pseudomonadales also increased significantly following secukinumab therapy. In contrast, there was no significant change in gut microbiome composition following ustekinumab treatment, and only genus Coprococcus significantly increased after 6 months of ustekinumab therapy. Moreover, we observed significant differences in baseline gut microbiome between responders and non-responders to secukinumab treatment.These results indicate that gut microbiome is altered differently after anti-IL17 and anti-IL12/23 treatment. Secukinumab (anti-IL17) therapy is associated with distinct and more profound gut microbiome shifts than ustekinumab therapy (anti-IL 12/23) in patients with psoriasis. Moreover, gut microbiome would serve as potential biomarkers of response to secukinumab treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559791>Protective antigen domain 4 of <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> as a candidate for use as vaccine for anthrax.</a></h2><p>Existing research for using the protective antigen (PA) of <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> as a vaccine component shows that protection against anthrax may be obtained using fragments of this protein.

Nowadays,  appears to play a leading role in the treatment of various tumor types. Characterization of the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) and immune checkpoints can possibly help identify new immunotherapeutic targets for DTs. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 33 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from DT samples to characterize the TME and the immune checkpoint expression profile. We stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, FoxP3, CD45RO, CD56, CD68, NKp46, granzyme , CD27, CD70, PD1 and PD-L1. We investigated the expression of the markers in the tumoral stroma, as well as at the periphery of the tumor. We found that most of the tumors showed organization of lymphocytes into lymphoid aggregates at the periphery of the tumor, strongly resembling tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs). The tumor expressed a significant number of memory T cells, both at the periphery and in the tumoral stroma. In the lymphoid aggregates, we also recognized a significant proportion of regulatory T cells. The immune checkpoint ligand PD-L1 was negative on the tumor cells in almost all samples. On the other hand, PD1 was partially expressed in lymphocytes at the periphery of the tumor. To conclude, we are the first to show that DTs display a strong immune infiltration at the tumor margins, with formation of lymphoid aggregates. Moreover, we demonstrated that there is no PD-L1-driven immune suppression present in the tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539924>Transgenic Tumor Models for Evaluating CAR T-Cell Immunotherapies.</a></h2><p>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy against tumor antigens involves a recombinant immunoreceptor that combines an antibody-derived targeting fragment with signaling domains capable of activating T cells and fusion of this receptor domain to a costimulatory domain (typically CD28 or 4-1BB).

Using lentiviral over-expression and adeno-associated viral knockdown approaches, the function of AURKB was further investigated by western blot, immunohistochemistry, RNA sequencing, and pain behavior tests. We found that AURKB over-expression in naive rats caused spinal microgliosis and pain hypersensitivity, whereas AURKB knockdown reduced microgliosis and alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Accordingly, RNA sequencing data revealed down-regulation of genes critically involved in signaling pathways associated with spinal microgliosis and neuropathic pain after AURKB knockdown in CCI rats. To examine its therapeutic potential for treatment of neuropathic pain, animals were treated intrathecally with the pharmacological AURKB inhibitor AZD1152-HQPA resulting in the alleviation of CCI-induced pain. Taken together, our findings indicated that AURKB plays a critical role in spinal microgliosis and neuropathic pain. Targeting AURKB may be an efficient method for treatment of neuropathic pain subsequent to peripheral nerve injury.

Here, we show that the IL-6 signaling pathway is also active in a subset of diffuse large -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients with particularly poor prognosis. Primary DLBCL cells and DLBCL cell lines expressing IL-6R engraft and form orthotopic lymphomas in humanized mice that ectopically produce human IL-6, and in mice reconstituted with a human immune system. We show that a subset of DLBCL cases have evolved mechanisms that ensure constitutive activation of the IL-6 signaling pathway, i.e., the expression of both chains of the IL-6R, the expression of the cytokine itself, and the mutational inactivation of a negative regulator of IL-6 signaling, SOCS1. IL-6 signaling promotes MYC-driven lymphomagenesis in a genetically engineered model, and treatment with the IL-6R-specific antibody tocilizumab reduces growth of primary DLBCL cells and of DLBCL cell lines in various therapeutic settings. The combined results uncover the IL-6 signaling pathway as a driver and negative prognosticator in aggressive DLBCL that can be targeted with a safe and well-tolerated biologic.© 2019 The Authors.

At the cellular level, these tumours are composed of a mixture of neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells, including tumour-associated macrophages and endothelial cells. Cerebral oedema is a near-universal occurrence in patients afflicted with glioblastoma and it is almost exclusively managed with the corticosteroid dexamethasone despite significant drawbacks associated with its use. Here, we demonstrate that dexamethasone blocks interleukin-1 production in both bone marrow-derived and brain resident macrophage populations following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon gamma. Additionally, dexamethasone is shown to inhibit downstream effectors of interleukin-1 signalling in both macrophage populations. Co-culture of bone marrow-derived macrophages with organotypic tumour slices results in an upregulation of interleukin-1 cytokines, an effect that is absent in co-cultured microglia. Genetic ablation of interleukin-1 ligands or receptor in mice bearing RCAS/tv-a-induced platelet-derived growth factor -overexpressing glioblastoma results in reduced oedema and partial restoration of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, respectively; similar to results obtained with vascular endothelial growth factor neutralization. We establish that tumours from dexamethasone-treated mice exhibit reduced infiltration of cells of the myeloid and lymphoid compartments, an effect that should be considered during clinical trials for  in glioblastoma patients. Additionally, we emphasize that caution should be used when immune profiling and single-cell RNA sequencing data are interpreted from fresh glioblastoma patient samples, as nearly all patients receive dexamethasone after diagnosis. Collectively, this evidence suggests that interleukin-1 signalling inhibition and dexamethasone treatment share therapeutic efficacies and establishes interleukin-1 signalling as an attractive and specific therapeutic target for the management of glioblastoma-associated cerebral oedema.© The Author(s) (2019).

HCWs' behaviours as well as facilitators and barriers towards their vaccination for a number of VPDs were explored through an EU-wide survey.HCWs across the EU answered online survey that explored attitudes and behaviours towards vaccination for a number of VPDs. Response data were adjusted based on weights estimated by HCWs' country and working profession according to WHO statistics. The survey was delivered between October 2012 and April 2014.Analysis was based on responses from 5,424 HCWs from 14 European countries. The majority (86.7%) had a positive attitude regarding immunizations. HCWs considered influenza (86.4%), viral hepatitis type  (71.9%) and tuberculosis (59.1%) as higher risk diseases for occupational exposure in the workplace. However, 43.8% reported not receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine in the last 10 years and 65.6% reported not receiving the pandemic influenza vaccine in 2009. Main enablers towards immunizations included believing in vaccine protection and easy, free of charge access to vaccines in the workplace. Barriers to up-to-date immunizations differed according to disease but included concerns about short- and long-term effects.Although the concept of mandatory vaccination seems to be favoured by many health professionals in Europe, it remains a controversial subject both among HCWs' profession categories and also among different countries. Interventions to increase vaccination among HCWs would benefit by tailoring their approach according to disease and target group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497015>Hymenoptera Venom Allergy: How Does Venom  Prevent Anaphylaxis From Bee and Wasp Stings?</a></h2><p>Hymenoptera stings may cause both local and systemic allergic reactions and even life threatening anaphylaxis. Along with pharmaceutical drugs and foods, hymenoptera venom is one of the most common causes of anaphylaxis in humans. To date, no parameter has been identified that may predict which sensitized people will have a future systemic sting reaction (SSR), however some risk factors, such as mastocytosis and age >40 years are known. Venom  (VIT) is the most effective method of treatment for people who had SSR, which is shown to be effective even after discontinuation of the therapy. Development of peripheral tolerance is the main mechanism during . It is mediated by the production of blocking IgG/IgG4 antibodies that may inhibit IgE dependent reactions through both high affinity (FcεRI) and low affinity (FcεRII) IgE receptors on mast cells, basophils and  cells. The generation of antigen specific regulatory T cells produces IL-10 and suppresses Th2 immunity and the immune responses shift toward a Th1-type response.  regulatory cells are also involved in the production of IL-10 and the development of long term immune tolerance. During VIT the number of effector cells in target organs also decreases, such as mast cells, basophils, innate type 2 lymphocytes and eosinophils. Several meta-analyses and randomized controlled studies have proved that VIT is effective for preventing SSR to a sting and improves the quality of life. In this review, the risk of SSR in venom allergy and how VIT changed this risk are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560714>IGFBP2 promotes immunosuppression associated with its mesenchymal induction and FcγRIIB phosphorylation in glioblastoma.</a></h2><p> shows a promise for treating glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant and immunosuppressive glioma. The mesenchymal phenotype of cancer cells was frequently reported to be associated with their induction of immunosuppression within the cancer microenvironment. Overexpressed insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) promotes GBM cell migration and invasion, and contributes to glioma progression and cancer recurrence and poor survival in GBM. However, whether IGFBP2 can induce immunosuppression in GBM was not reported yet. Thus, the study applied a syngeneic mouse GBM model, human GBM samples, and cancer-immune cell co-culture experiments to investigate the effect of IGFBP2 on GBM exposed immune cells and its association with the mesenchymal induction. We found that IGFBP2 promoted the mesenchymal feature of GBM cells. The inhibition of IGFBP2 relieved immunosuppression by increasing CD8+ T and CD19+  cells and decreasing CD163+ M2 macrophages. Further, the IGFBP2-promoted immunosuppression was associated with its induction of the mesenchymal feature of GBM cells and the inhibitory phosphorylated FcγRIIB of GBM exposed immune cells. Blocking IGFBP2 suppressed tumor growth and improved survival of tumor bearing mice in the mouse GBM model. These findings support the notion that targeting the IGFBP2 may present an effective immunotherapeutic strategy for mesenchymal GBMs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580408>Current targeted therapies in lymphomas.</a></h2><p>This article summarizes current targeted therapies that have received regulatory approval for the treatment of - and T-cell lymphomas.Over the last 20 years, new drug therapies for lymphomas of  cells and T cells have expanded considerably. Targeted therapies for -cell lymphomas include: (1) monoclonal antibodies directed at the CD20 lymphocyte antigen, examples of which are rituximab, ofatumumab, and obinutuzumab; (2) gene transfer therapy, an example of which is chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell (CAR-T) therapy directed at the CD19 antigen expressed on the cell surface of both immature and mature  cells; and (3) small-molecule inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, copanlisib, duvelisib, and idelalisib) that target the -cell receptor signaling pathway. Of note, brentuximab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate that targets CD30, another lymphocyte antigen expressed on the cell surface of both Hodgkin lymphoma (a variant of -cell lymphoma) and some T-cell lymphomas. Although aberrant epigenetic signaling pathways are present in both - and T-cell lymphomas, epigenetic inhibitors (examples include belinostat, vorinostat, and romidepsin) are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for T-cell lymphomas only. In addition, therapies that target the tumor microenvironment have been developed. Examples include mogamulizumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab. In summary, the efficacy of these agents has led to the development of supportive care to mitigate adverse effects, due to the presence of on- or off-target toxicities.The therapeutic landscape of lymphomas has continued to evolve. In turn, the efficacy of these agents has led to the development of supportive care to mitigate adverse effects, due to the presence of on- or off-target toxicities. Further opportunities are warranted to identify patients who are most likely to achieve durable response and reduce the risk of disease progression. Ongoing trials with current and investigational agents may further elucidate their place in therapy and therapeutic benefits.© American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2019. All rights reserved.

Repeat chemotherapy shows decreasing efficacy and increasing toxicity with each course. Newer therapies targeting BRAF/MEK or Bruton's tyrosine kinase are effective but generally leave MRD. Rituximab has modest activity as a single agent and can achieve MRD-negative CR in combination with purine analogs, but there is significant toxicity from the chemotherapy. Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk (Moxe) is a biologic containing an antibody fragment (Fv) binding to CD22, attached to a portion of  exotoxin A. Binding to CD22 enables the toxin to enter and kill cells. Moxe is administered by 30-minute infusions on days 1, 3, and 5 of up to six cycles spaced 4 weeks apart. In phase I testing, 64% of 33 patients at the highest dose level achieved CR, most without MRD. Lack of MRD correlated with prolonged CR duration; of 11 MRD-negative CRs, 10 were still in CR after a median of 42 months of observation. In pivotal testing, 75% of 80 patients had a hematologic response, 41% with CR; 82% (27/33) of CRs were MRD-negative, and only 4 of the 27 MRD-negative patients relapsed during the follow-up period. Hemolytic uremic syndrome and capillary leak syndrome were each observed in 9% of patients, all reversible. In September 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Moxe for the treatment of relapsed/refractory HCL after ≥2 prior therapies. Moxe is undergoing further development in combination with rituximab. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) has effective treatments including purine analogs with and without rituximab, and oral inhibitors of BRAF, MEK and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Despite these therapies, relapse occurs, and moxetumomab pasudotox has an important role in relapsed and refractory HCL because of its ability to achieve high rates of complete remissions (CRs) without chemotherapy; most of these CRs are without minimal residual disease (MRD). CR duration is enhanced in patients who achieve eradication of MRD. To improve the efficacy of this recombinant immunotoxin, a phase I trial is underway in combination with rituximab to reduce tumor burden and decrease immunogenicity.Published 2019.

The aim of this study was to design a more efficient vaccine against novel target for the treatment of hypertension.The epitope CE12, derived from the human L-type calcium channel (Ca 1.2), was designed and conjugated with Qβ bacteriophage virus-like particles to test the efficacy in hypertensive animals. Further, the HBcAg-CE12-CQ10 vaccine, a bivalent vaccine based on hepatitis  core antigen virus-like particles and targeting both human angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT R) and Ca 1.2, was developed and evaluated in hypertensive rodents.The Qβ-CE12 vaccine effectively decreased the blood pressure in hypertensive rodents. Monoclonal antibody against CE12 specifically bound to L-type calcium channel and inhibited the channel. Injection with monoclonal antibody against CE12 effectively reduced the blood pressure in angiotensin II-induced hypertensive mice. The HBcAg-CE12-CQ10 vaccine showed antihypertensive effect in hypertensive mice and relatively superior antihypertensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats and ameliorated L-NAME-induced renal injury. In addition, no obvious immune-mediated damage or electrophysiological adverse effects were detected. against both AT R and Ca 1.2 decreased the blood pressure in hypertensive rodents effectively, and provided protection against hypertensive target organ damage without obvious feedback activation of renin-angiotensin system or induction of dominant antibodies against the carrier protein. Thus, the HBcAg-CE12-CQ10 vaccine may provide a novel and promising therapeutic approach for hypertension.This article is protected by copyright.

The gene regulatory landscape of this dynamic system has not been fully characterized in human cells. Here we collected assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing data under resting and stimulated conditions for up to 32 immune cell populations. Stimulation caused widespread chromatin remodeling, including response elements shared between stimulated  and T cells. Furthermore, several autoimmune traits showed significant heritability in stimulation-responsive elements from distinct cell types, highlighting the importance of these cell states in autoimmunity. Allele-specific read mapping identified variants that alter chromatin accessibility in particular conditions, allowing us to observe evidence of function for a candidate causal variant that is undetected by existing large-scale studies in resting cells. Our results provide a resource of chromatin dynamics and highlight the need to characterize the effects of genetic variation in stimulated cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578576>CAR T cell therapy: A new era for cancer treatment (Review).</a></h2><p>Cancer has recently been identified as the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Several conventional treatments and cytotoxic immunotherapies have been developed and made available to the market. Considering the complex behavior of tumors and the involvement of numerous genetic and cellular factors involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis, there is a need to develop a promising  that targets tumors at both the cellular and genetic levels. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a novel therapeutic T cell engineering practice, in which T cells derived from patient blood are engineered in vitro to express artificial receptors targeted to a specific tumor antigen. These directly identify the tumor antigen without the involvement of the major histocompatibility complex. The use of this therapy in the last few years has been successful, with a reduction in remission rates of up to 80% for hematologic cancer, particularly for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non‑Hodgkin lymphomas, such as large  cell lymphoma. Recently, anti‑CD19 CAR therapy, or UCART19, has been shown to be efficacious in treating relapsed/refractory hematologic cancer. Several other cell surface tumor antigens, such as CD20 and CD22, found in the majority of leukemias and lymphomas are considered potential targets by pharmaceutical companies and research organizations, and trials have been ongoing in this direction. Although this therapeutic regimen is currently confined to treating hematologic cancer, the increasing involvement of several auxiliary techniques, such as bispecific CAR, Tan‑CAR, inhibitory‑CAR, combined antigens, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats gene‑editing tool and nanoparticle delivery, may substantially improve its overall anticancer effects. CAR therapy has the potential to offer a rapid and safer treatment regime to treat non‑solid and solid tumors. The present review presents an insight into the advantages and the advances of CAR  and presents the emerging discrepancy of CAR therapy over usual forms of therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500350>Advances in Molecular Biology and Targeted Therapy of Mantle Cell Lymphoma.</a></h2><p>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a heterogeneous malignancy with a broad spectrum of clinical behavior from indolent to highly aggressive cases. Despite the fact that MCL remains in most cases incurable by currently applied immunochemotherapy, our increasing knowledge on the biology of MCL in the last two decades has led to the design, testing, and approval of several innovative agents that dramatically changed the treatment landscape for MCL patients. Most importantly, the implementation of new drugs and novel treatment algorithms into clinical practice has successfully translated into improved outcomes of MCL patients not only in the clinical trials, but also in real life. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of MCL, and provides a brief survey of currently used treatment options with special focus on mode of action of selected innovative anti-lymphoma molecules.

In these patients, prophylaxis may be considered to improve their quality of life and control overuse of antibiotics. Despite this need, there is currently no Latin American consensus on the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs. This consensus, signed by a panel of regional and international experts on UTI management, aims to address this need and is the first step toward a Latin American consensus on a number of urogynecological conditions. The panel agrees that antibiotics should be considered the primary treatment option for symptomatic UTI, taking into account local pathogen resistance patterns. Regarding prophylaxis, immunoactive therapy with the bacterial lysate OM-89 received a grade A recommendation and local estrogen in postmenopausal women grade  recommendation. Lower-grade recommendations include behavior modification and D-mannose; probiotics (Lactobacilli), cranberries, and hyaluronic acid (and derivatives) received limited recommendations; their use should be discussed with the patient.

However, most patients do not benefit. Therefore, biomarkers are needed that accurately predict response. We hypothesized that molecular profiling of exhaled air may capture the inflammatory milieu related to the individual responsiveness to anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1) therapy. This study aimed to determine the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis at baseline for assessing nonresponders versus responders to anti-PD-1 therapy in NSCLC patients.This was a prospective observational study in patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy using both a training and validation set of NSCLC patients. At baseline, breath profiles were collected in duplicate by a metal oxide semiconductor electronic nose (eNose) positioned at the rear end of a pneumotachograph. Patients received nivolumab or pembrolizumab of which the efficacy was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 at 3-month follow-up. Data analysis involved advanced signal-processing and statistics based on independent t-tests followed by linear discriminant and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.Exhaled breath data of 143 NSCLC patients (training: 92, validation: 51) were available at baseline. ENose sensors contributed significantly (P < 0.05) at baseline in differentiating between patients with different responses at 3 months of anti-PD-1 treatment. The eNose sensors were combined into a single biomarker with an ROC-area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 [confidence interval (CI) 0.82-0.96]. This AUC was confirmed in the validation set: 0.85 (CI 0.75-0.96).ENose assessment was effective in the noninvasive prediction of individual patient responses to . The predictive accuracy and efficacy of the eNose for discrimination of  responder types were replicated in an independent validation set op patients.

Host-microbe interactions are highly relevant in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), i.e., a replacement of the cellular components of the patients' immune system with that of a foreign donor. HSCT is employed as curative  for a number of non-malignant and malignant hematologic conditions, including cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The procedure can be accompanied by severe side effects such as infections, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), and death. Here, we performed a longitudinal analysis of immunological markers, immune reconstitution and gut microbiota composition in relation to clinical outcomes in children undergoing HSCT. Such an analysis could reveal biomarkers, e.g., at the time point prior to HSCT, that in the future could be used to predict which patients are of high risk in relation to side effects and clinical outcomes and guide treatment strategies accordingly.In two multivariate analyses (sparse partial least squares regression and canonical correspondence analysis), we identified three consistent clusters: (1) high concentrations of the antimicrobial peptide human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) prior to the transplantation in patients with high abundances of Lactobacillaceae, who later developed moderate or severe aGvHD and exhibited high mortality. (2) Rapid reconstitution of NK and  cells in patients with high abundances of obligate anaerobes such as Ruminococcaceae, who developed no or mild aGvHD and exhibited low mortality. (3) High inflammation, indicated by high levels of C-reactive protein, in patients with high abundances of facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae. Furthermore, we observed that antibiotic treatment influenced the bacterial community state.We identify multivariate associations between specific microbial taxa, host immune markers, immune cell reconstitution, and clinical outcomes in relation to HSCT. Our findings encourage further investigations into establishing longitudinal surveillance of the intestinal microbiome and relevant immune markers, such as hBD2, in HSCT patients. Profiling of the microbiome may prove useful as a prognostic tool that could help identify patients at risk of poor immune reconstitution and adverse outcomes, such as aGvHD and death, upon HSCT, providing actionable information in guiding precision medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583919>Blinatumomab: a novel therapy for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</a></h2><p>: Blinatumomab, a first-in-class bispecific T cell engager, is a member of a novel class of bispecific antibody constructs with dual binding specificities.

The aim of the current study was to develop a topical nano-liposomal Amphotericin  (AmB) for the treatment of CL.Liposomes containing 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4% AmB (Lip-AmB) were formulated and characterized for the size, entrapment efficiency, long term stability, and skin penetration properties using Franz diffusion cells. Liposomes diameters were around 100 nm with no change during more than 20 months' storage either at 4 °C or at room temperature. Franz diffusion cells studies showed that almost 4% of the applied formulations penetrated across the skin and the highest skin retention (73.92%) observed with Lip-AmB 0.4%. The median effective doses (ED), the doses of AmB required to kill 50% of L. major amastigotes were 0.151, 0.151, and 0.0856 (μg/mL) in Lip-AmB 0.1, 0.2, 0.4%, respectively. Lip-AmB 0.4% caused 80% reduction in fluorescence intensity of GFP+ L. tropica infected macrophages at 5 μg/mL of AmB concentration. Topical Lip-AmB was applied twice a day for 4 weeks to the skin of BALB/c mice to treat lesions caused by L. major. Results showed the superiority of Lip-AmB 0.4% compared to Lip-AmB 0.2 and 0.1%. The parasite was completely cleared from the skin site of infection and spleens at week 8 and 12 post-infection in mice treated with Lip-AmB 0.4%.

The key drugs are immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs), whose mechanism of action is to elicit immune response against cancer cell antigens. Three types of CPIs are currently used and approved: an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab; anti-PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab; and anti-PD-L1 antibodies: atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab. CPIs have been widely used in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma settings, metastatic lung cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, renal cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck tumours, and Merkel cell carcinoma. However, side effects of CPIs differ from toxicities of other oncological drugs. According to literature data, in 10-30% of patients CPIs are responsible for immune-related adverse events (irAE) associated with excessive activation of the immune system. Systemic irAEs include enterocolitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, hypophysitis, and autoimmune thyroid disease. However, the most common irAEs of checkpoint inhibitors are dermatologic toxicities ranging from pruritus and mild dermatoses to severe reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Each irAE can become serious if not early diagnosed and appropriately treated. In the article we present different types of skin irAEs related to CPIs together with the recommended therapies.Copyright: © 2019 Termedia Sp. z o. o.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653980>Immune subtyping of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma: a new biomarker and an immune shift during disease progression.</a></h2><p>Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is an aggressive lymphoma that is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection.

The immune evasion group showed high cytotoxic T-cell counts and high PD-L1 expression but low Treg counts. In the immune-silenced group, almost all immune responses were exhausted, most patients were at an advanced stage, and had the poorest disease prognosis among the tumor immune microenvironment subgroups. In some patients (n = 3), a shift in the tumor immune microenvironment subgroup classification was observed in sequential biopsies. The response rate to pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, was 100% (1/1) in the immune tolerance group, 60% (3/5) in the immune evasion group, and 0% (0/5) in the immune-silenced group. We classified extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma into four tumor immune microenvironment subgroups using a new classification system. In conclusion, we propose that the tumor immune microenvironment of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma may change during disease progression and may serve as a useful biomarker for .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607335>[Advance of Research on the  Targeting  Cell Maration Antigen for Multiple Myeloma--Review].</a></h2><p>Abstract　　 cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is an ideal target for precise treatment due to its highly selective expression on malignant myeloma cells.

Many tumors express anti-inflammatory factors that deactivate the local immune response or recruit peripheral macrophages into pro-tumor roles. Because of this, effective and specific ways of activating macrophages into anti-tumor phenotypes is highly desirable for  purposes. Here, the use of a small molecule TLR agonist as a macrophage activator for anti-cancer therapy is reported. This compound, referred to as PBI1, demonstrated unique activation characteristics and expression patterns compared to treatment with LPS, through activation of TLR4. Furthermore, PBI1 treatment resulted in anti-tumor immune behavior, enhancing macrophage phagocytic efficiency five-fold versus non-treated macrophages. Additive effects were observed via use of a complementary strategy (anti-CD47 antibody), resulting in ∼10-fold enhancement of phagocytosis, suggesting this small molecule approach could be used in conjunction with other therapeutics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The presence of various immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment, especially tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), has been shown to be a driving force in tumor initiation and development. Reversion of the TAM phenotype is an effective way to induce a subsequent antitumor immune response. In this study, we developed baicalin-loaded poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles containing an antigenic peptide (Hgp 100, Hgp) and a toll-like receptor 9 agonist (CpG). The nanoparticles were further coated with a galactose-inserted erythrocyte membrane, which actively targeted the TAMs. The TAM polarization and tumor treatment effectiveness of the nanoparticles were evaluated. The biomimetic nanoparticles showed enhanced cell uptake in vitro and targeted effects in vivo. In addition, compared with baicalin-loaded PLGA-NPs (@NPs), the biomimetic nanoparticles, such as Hgp/@NPs-CpG and NPs@RBC-Gala, significantly polarized the TAMs such that they changed from the M2 type to the M1 type both in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently, the infiltration of CD4 T and CD8 T cells into tumor sites after being induced by the biomimetic nanoparticles was greatly increased, which suggested a significant enhancement of the immune activation effect and T cell response. In addition, the activation of the T cells and induction of the CTL responses effectively suppressed melanoma tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, the biomimetic nanoparticles effectively reversed the TAM phenotype from M2 to M1, which further improved the tumor immune microenvironment and promoted tumor . These results suggested that the TAM-targeted biomimetic drug delivery system had the potential to reverse the phenotypes of TAMs contributing to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and promote tumor treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609046>Hippocampal segmentation for brains with extensive atrophy using three-dimensional convolutional neural networks.</a></h2><p>Hippocampal volumetry is a critical biomarker of aging and dementia, and it is widely used as a predictor of cognitive performance; however, automated hippocampal segmentation methods are limited because the algorithms are (a) not publicly available, () subject to error with significant brain atrophy, cerebrovascular disease and lesions, and/or (c) computationally expensive or require parameter tuning. In this study, we trained a 3D convolutional neural network using 259 bilateral manually delineated segmentations collected from three studies, acquired at multiple sites on different scanners with variable protocols. Our training dataset consisted of elderly cases difficult to segment due to extensive atrophy, vascular disease, and lesions. Our algorithm, (HippMapp3r), was validated against four other publicly available state-of-the-art techniques (HippoDeep, FreeSurfer, SBHV, volBrain, and FIRST). HippMapp3r outperformed the other techniques on all three metrics, generating an average Dice of 0.89 and a correlation coefficient of 0.95. It was two orders of magnitude faster than some of the tested techniques. Further validation was performed on 200 subjects from two other disease populations (frontotemporal dementia and vascular cognitive impairment), highlighting our method's low outlier rate. We finally tested the methods on real and simulated "clinical adversarial" cases to study their robustness to corrupt, low-quality scans.

We reviewed the literature on non-Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to highlight future perspectives. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov to include phase I/II clinical trials. Data from 39 studies (1906 patients) were included. Of all the agents, Isatuximab (Isa, anti-CD38) and F50067 (anti-CXCR4) were the only mAbs to produce encouraging results as monotherapy with overall response rates (ORRs) of 66.7% and 32% respectively. Isa showed activity when used in combination with lenalidomide (Len) and dexamethasone (Dex), producing a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 83%. Additionally, Isa used in combination with pomalidomide (Pom) and Dex resulted in a CBR of 73%. Indatuximab Ravtansine (anti-CD138 antibody-drug conjugate) produced an ORR of 78% and 79% when used in combination with Len-Dex and Pom-Dex, respectively.Combination therapy using mAbs such as indatuximab, pembrolizumab, lorvotuzumab, siltuximab or dacetuzumab with chemotherapy agents produced better outcomes as compared to monotherapies.

Therefore, their utilization for cancer immunization can cause an effective antitumor immune response. However, the main challenge is identifying the most effective antigens for this purpose.Hydatid cyst fluid fractions including the glycolipid fraction, glycoprotein fraction, 78 kDa fraction, and antigen  fraction were prepared. Then, the BALB/c mice were immunized against different antigens and, subsequently, 4T1 cells were subcutaneously implanted. The tumors' growth, metastasis, and tumor-bearing mice survival were assessed in different immunized groups. In addition, IL-2, IL-4, IFN-γ, and TNF-α serum levels were estimated to evaluate the immune system response.BALB/c mice immunization against the complete hydatid cyst fluid antigens exhibited more significant inhibition of the tumors' growth and metastasis and increase of tumor-bearing mice survival in comparison with its derived fractions. However, the 78 kDa fraction exhibited the best results according to the same factors in comparison with all the prepared fractions.The 78 kDa fraction of the hydatid cyst fluid was the most effective fraction of hydatid cyst fluid for immunization against 4T1 breast tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590152>Physician Experience and Risk of Rituximab Discontinuation in Older Adults With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.</a></h2><p>Provider experience, or clinical volume, is associated with improved outcomes in many complex healthcare settings. Despite increased complexity of anticancer therapies, studies evaluating physician-level experience and cancer treatment outcomes are lacking.A population-based study was conducted of older adults (aged ≥66 years) diagnosed with -cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2004 through 2011 using SEER-Medicare data. Analysis focused on outcomes in patients receiving rituximab, the first approved monoclonal anticancer . We hypothesized that lower physician experience using rituximab and managing its infusion-related reactions would be associated with early treatment discontinuation. A 12-month look-back from each initiation of rituximab was used to categorize physician volume (0, 1-2, or ≥3 initiations per year). Modified Poisson regression was used to account for provider-level correlation and estimated relative risk (RR) of early rituximab discontinuation (<3 cycles within 180 days of rituximab initiation). Cox proportional hazards were used to measure the impact of rituximab discontinuation on survival.Among 15,110 patients who initiated rituximab with 2,684 physicians, 7.6% experienced early rituximab discontinuation. Approximately one-fourth of patients (26.1%) initiated rituximab with a physician who had no rituximab initiations during the preceding 12 months. Compared with patients treated by physicians who had ≥3 rituximab initiations in the prior year, those treated by physicians without initiations were 57% more likely to experience early discontinuation (adjusted RR [aRR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.35-1.82; P<.001 for 0 vs ≥3, and aRR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03-1.37; P=.02 for 1-2 vs ≥3). Additionally, rituximab discontinuation was associated with higher risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.28-1.52; P<.001).Lower oncologist experience with rituximab was associated with increased risk of early rituximab discontinuation in Medicare beneficiaries with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

We focused on sole injection of tumor cells that were inactivated by HHP and their combination with local radiotherapy (RTx) for  induction of anti-tumor immune responses. HHP-treatment of tumor cells resulted in pre-dominantly necrotic cells with degraded DNA. We confirmed that treatments at 200 MPa or higher completely inhibited the formation of tumor cell colonies . No tumor growth was seen  after injection of HHP-treated tumor cells. Single vaccination with HHP-killed tumor cells combined with local RTx significantly retarded tumor growth and improved the survival as shown in B16-F10 and CT26 tumor models. In B16-F10 tumors that were irradiated with 2 × 5Gy and vaccinated once with HHP-killed tumor cells, the amount of natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes/macrophages, CD4+ T cells and NKT cells was significantly increased, while the amount of  cells was significantly decreased. In both models, a trend of increased CD8+ T cell infiltration was observed. Generally, in irradiated tumors high amounts of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1 were found. We conclude that HHP generates inactivated tumor cells that can be used as a tumor vaccine. Moreover, we show for the first time that tumor cell-based vaccine acts synergistically with RTx to significantly retard tumor growth by generating a favorable anti-tumor immune microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465643>Pharmacology Focus: CAR-T Cell Therapy in -Cell Lymphomas.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485984>CD47: role in the immune system and application to cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>CD47 is a widely expressed cellular receptor well known for its immunoregulatory functions. By interacting with its ligands, including thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα), integrins, and SH2-domain bearing protein tyrosine phosphatase substrate-1 (SHPS-1), it modulates cellular phagocytosis by macrophages, transmigration of neutrophils and activation of dendritic cells, T cells and  cells. Ample studies have shown that various types of cancer express high levels of CD47 to escape from the immune system. Based on this observation, CD47 is currently considered as a prominent target in cancer therapy.Here, we review the role of CD47 in the maintenance of immune system homeostasis. We also depict three emerging CD47-targeting strategies for cancer therapy, including the use of mimicry peptides, antibodies, and gene silencing strategies. Among these approaches, the most advanced one is the use of anti-CD47 antibodies, which enhances cancer cell phagocytosis via inhibition of the CD47-SIRPα axis. These antibodies can also achieve higher anti-cancer efficacies when combined with chemotherapy and  and hold promise for improving the survival of patients with cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585984>Axicabtagene Ciloleucel, an Anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy for Relapsed or Refractory Large -Cell Lymphoma: Practical Implications for the Community Oncologist.</a></h2><p>Axicabtagene ciloleucel is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory large -cell lymphoma after ≥2 prior systemic therapies. Although axicabtagene ciloleucel is administered only at authorized treatment centers, community oncologists play a critical role in the CAR T-cell treatment journey, recognizing potentially eligible patients for referral and then, after treatment, closely collaborating with treatment centers to monitor and manage patients long term. ZUMA-1, the pivotal, multicenter, phase I/II study of 108 patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel, resulted in an objective response rate of 83%, including 58% complete responses. With a 27.1-month median follow-up, 39% of patients had ongoing responses. CAR T-cell therapy is associated with the potentially life-threatening adverse events (AEs) of cytokine release syndrome and neurologic events, which generally occur early after treatment. In ZUMA-1, cytokine release syndrome and neurologic events were generally reversible and grade ≥3 cytokine release syndrome and neurologic events occurred in 11% and 32% of patients, respectively. Frequent prolonged AEs included hypogammaglobulinemia, -cell aplasia, and cytopenias requiring supportive care until recovery of hematopoietic function. Rate of treatment-related mortality was low, at <2%. With appropriate management of common AEs, axicabtagene ciloleucel offers the potential for long-term durable responses in patients who otherwise lack curative treatment options. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Community oncologists should be familiar with key aspects of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell indications and eligibility to help recognize and refer potential patients for this paradigm-changing treatment option at the appropriate time during the disease course. To ensure optimal long-term outcomes for patients who have been treated with CAR T-cell therapy, oncologists must also be familiar with common prolonged AEs and their monitoring and management.© AlphaMed Press 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624089>Amphiphysin-IgG autoimmune neuropathy: A recognizable clinicopathologic syndrome.</a></h2><p>To define the clinicopathologic features of amphiphysin-immunoglobulin G (IgG)-mediated neuropathy.Patients examined at our institution from January 1, 1995, to September 30, 2018, with amphiphysin-IgG by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot, were reviewed. Their phenotypes were compared to cases of coexisting collapsin response-mediator protein-5 (CRMP5)-IgG or anti-neuronal nuclear antibody type 1 (ANNA1-IgG) and CRMP5-IgG autoimmunity. Improvement in modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (≥1) on follow-up was considered a favorable outcome. Amphiphysin RNA expression was assessed in healthy nerves.Fifty-three amphiphysin-IgG-positive cases were identified. Of 33 (60%) patients with neuropathy, 21 had amphiphysin-IgG alone, and 12 had coexisting autoantibodies (ANNA1-IgG, n = 8; CRMP5-IgG, n = 2; ANNA1-IgG and CRMP5-IgG, n = 2). The neuropathies in isolated amphiphysin-IgG autoimmunity included polyradiculoneuropathy (62%), diffuse sensory neuronopathy (35%), and facial neuropathy with gastroparesis (3%). Among these, pain (80%), breast cancer (63%), and CNS (57%) involvements commonly coexisted, and neuropathy frequently prompted breast cancer diagnosis (76%). Stiff-person spectrum disorder was the most common CNS accompaniment (45%). Nerve biopsies showed axonal loss (n = 6/6), subperineurial edema (n = 4/6), and CD4 predominant inflammation (n = 2/6). Median mRS score at last follow-up was 3.5; 58% of patients were -responsive. Patients with amphiphysin-IgG alone had more favorable  response than patients with CRMP5-IgG polyneuropathy (n = 45) (44% vs 16%,  = 0.028, odds ratio 4.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 15.5). Only 1/9 (11%) patients with amphiphysin-IgG with coexisting CRMP5-IgG or ANNA1-IgG had  response.

We infused a low-dose of CD19.CAR-modified virus-specific T cells (CD19.CAR-VST) without prior cytoreductive chemotherapy into 8 patients after allogeneic stem cell transplant.Absent virus reactivation, we saw no CD19.CAR-VST expansion. By contrast, in patients with viral reactivation, up to 30,000-fold expansion of CD19.CAR-VSTs was observed, with depletion of CD19+ -cells. Five patients remain in remission at 42-60+ months.Dual TCR and CAR stimulation can thus potentiate effector cell expansion and CAR-target cell killing, even when infusing low numbers of effector cells without cytoreduction.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571226>Recent developments and highlights in allergic rhinitis.</a></h2><p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a disease with high prevalence all over the world and therefore needs to be thoroughly investigated and treated accordingly.

While 9p24.1 CNA was also reported in diffuse large -cell lymphoma (DLBCL), little is known about its molecular or clinical significance. In this study, we analyzed the prevalence of 9p24.1 CNA in newly diagnosed DLBCL and examined its association with PD-L1, PD-L2, and JAK2 expression, clinical characteristics, and outcome. We found that 10% of DLBCL cases had CNA of 9p24.1, with 6.5% gains, and 3.5% amplifications. Only the cases with a 9p24.1 amplification had high levels of PD-L1, PD-L2, and JAK2 expression. Gains or amplifications of 9p24.1 were associated with a younger age and the ABC/non-GCB subtype. Compared with DLBCL cases without 9p24.1 CNA, the cases with a 9p24.1 amplification had a trend of better event-free survival. Furthermore, the amplification cases had a gene expression and mutation profile similar to those of PMBCL.

However, the in vivo application of Type-A CpG has been limited because the rapid degradation in vivo results in relatively weak biological effect compared to other Type-, -C, and -P CpG ODNs, which have nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate backbones. To overcome this limitation, we developed lipid nanoparticles formulation containing a Type-A CpG ODN, D35 (D35LNP). When tested in a mouse tumor model, intratumoral and intravenous D35LNP administration significantly suppressed tumor growth in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner, whereas original D35 showed no efficacy. Tumor suppression was associated with Th1-related gene induction and activation of CD8 T cells in the tumor. The combination of D35LNP and an anti-PD-1 antibody increased the therapeutic efficacy. Importantly, the therapeutic schedule and dose of intravenous D35LNP did not induce apparent liver toxicity.
