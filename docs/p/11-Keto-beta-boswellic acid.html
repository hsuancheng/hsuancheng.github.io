The nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway has been considered a potential target for neuroprotection in stroke. Acetyl-11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid (AKBA) is an active triterpenoid compound from the extract of Boswellia serrate. The present study was to determine whether AKBA, a novel Nrf2 activator, can protect against cerebral ischemic injury. The stroke model was produced in Sprague-Dawley rats via middle cerebral artery occlusion. To model ischemia-like conditions in vitro, primary cultured cortical neurons were exposed to transient oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Treatment of AKBA significantly reduced infarct volumes and apoptotic cells, and also increased neurologic scores by elevating the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in brain tissues in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats at 48 hours post reperfusion. In primary cultured neurons, AKBA increased the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, which provided protection against OGD-induced oxidative insult. Additionally, AKBA treatment increased Nrf2 binding activity to antioxidant-response elements (ARE). The protective effect of AKBA was attenuated by knockdown of Nrf2 or HO-1. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence that AKBA protects neurons against ischemic injury, and this neuroprotective effect involves the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16258590>Protective effects of nimesulide (COX Inhibitor), AKBA (5-LOX Inhibitor), and their combination in aging-associated abnormalities in mice.</a></h2><p>Several inflammatory processes play a critical role in brain aging and are associated with increased vulnerability to neurodegeneration. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), two enzymes involved in the oxygenation of the arachidonic acid, are upregulated in the central nervous system during aging and are associated with different aging-related brain pathologies. The present experiment was performed to study the effects of 5-LOX inhibitor, acetyl- (AKBA), nimesulide (preferential COX-2 inhibitor), and their combination on cognitive performance of young and aged mice, using elevated plus maze test. Chronic administration of AKBA (100 mg/kg, p.o.) and nimesulide (2.42 mg/kg, p.o.) for 15 days significantly reversed the aging-induced retention deficit in mice. Coadministration of AKBA and nimesulide enhanced the cognitive performance in aged mice when compared with that in per se treatment. The aging-related increase in oxidative damage (increased LPO and decreased GSH) was reversed by AKBA, nimesulide, and their combination. Further, per se COX and LOX inhibitors and their combination did not produce any alteration in gastrointestinal parameters; they also reversed the aging-induced motor dysfunction in the aged animals. On the basis of these observations, present findings indicated that the combination of COX and LOX inhibitors (dual inhibitors) may provide a new therapeutic innovation for the treatment of aging-related brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and different motor dysfunctions with adequate gastrointestinal tolerability.(c) 2005 Prous Science.

However, pharmacokinetic studies have evidenced low systemic absorption of boswellic acids (BAs), especially of KBA and AKBA, in rodents and humans. This observation has provided a rationale to improve the formulation of Boswellia extract. We present here the results of a murine comparative bioavailability study of Casperome™, a soy lecithin formulation of standardized B. serrata gum resin extract (BE), and its corresponding non-formulated extract. The concentration of the six major BAs [11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA), acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), β-boswellic acid (βBA), acetyl-β-boswellic acid (AβBA), α-boswellic acid (αBA), and acetyl-α-boswellic acid (AαBA)] was evaluated in the plasma and in a series of tissues (brain, muscle, eye, liver and kidney), providing the first data on tissue distribution of BAs.  equivalent and equimolar oral administration of Casperome™ provided significantly higher plasma levels (up to 7-fold for KBA, and 3-fold for βBA quantified as area under the plasma concentration time curve, AUC(last)) compared to the non-formulated extract. This was accompanied by remarkably higher tissue levels. Of particular relevance was the marked increase in brain concentration of KBA and AKBA (35-fold) as well as βBA (3-fold) following Casperome™ administration. Notably, up to 17 times higher BA levels were observed in poorly vascularized organs such as the eye. The increased systemic availability of BAs and the improved tissue distribution, qualify Casperome™ for further clinical development to fully exploit the clinical potential of BE.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, its poor solubility in aqueous solvent, bioavailability, and rapid clearance limit its curative efficacy. To enhance its potency, in our study, AKBA-loaded o-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticle (AKBA-NP) delivery system was synthesized. The transmission electron microscopy and transmission electron microscope images of AKBA-NPs suggested that particle size was 132 ± 18 nm, and particles were spherical in shape with smooth morphology. In pharmacokinetics study, AKBA-NPs apparently increases the area under the curve of plasma concentration-time and prolonged half-life compared with AKBA. The tissue distribution study confirmed that AKBA-NPs had a better brain delivery efficacy in comparison with AKBA. The results from our pharmacodynamic studies showed that AKBA-NPs possess better neuroprotection compared with AKBA in primary neurons with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model and in animals with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Additionally, AKBA-NPs modulate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways more effectively than AKBA by increasing nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 expression, and by decreasing nuclear factor-kappa B and 5-lipoxygenase expression.

In total, four major metabolites were firstly biosynthesized and identified using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Among them, three metabolites were novel. The kinetic parameters (K m , V max , CL int, and K i ) were also analyzed systematically in various biological samples. Finally, the deacetylation of AKBA and hydroxylation of KBA were confirmed to be the major   based on their large CL int and the high amounts of KBA (46.7%) and hydroxylated KBA (50.8%) along with a low amount of AKBA (2.50%) in human primary hepatocytes.

Although CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 catalyzed the  of KBA, CYP3A4 played a predominant role in the hydroxylation reaction of KBA in human. Notably, deacetylation and regioselective hydroxylation exhibited considerable species differences. Deacetylation was only observed in human liver microsomes and primary human hepatocytes; 21- and 20-mono-hydroxylation of KBA were primarily observed in human, monkey, and dog; and 16- and 30-mono-hydroxylation were observed in other species. More importantly, all four mono-hydroxylation metabolites exhibited a moderate anti-inflammatory activity.

This study aimed to test whether B. serrata hydroalcoholic extract (BSE) and its active constituent 3-acetyl-1 1-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) could protect neurons against ischemic condition induced by oxygen, glucose and serum deprivation (OGSD). First, PC12 neural cells were incubated with BSE (0-400 pg/mL) or AKBA (0-40 pg/mL) for 24 h to find non-cytotoxic concentrations of BSE and AKBA. Then, the cells were pre- (for 2 h) and co-treated with 1.5-6 μg/mL BSE or 0.5-2.5 pg/mL AKBA, and then exposed to OGSD condition for 6 h. The IC50. values of BSE and AKBA were 95 and 12.2 μg/mL, respectively. BSE (3 and 6 pg/mL) and AKBA (1 and 2.5 pg/mL) significantly increased viability of ischemic cells, in a concertation-dependent manner. The levels of intracellular oxygen free radicals, lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage were also significantly and concentration-dependently decreased following treatment of ischemic cells with BSE or AKBA. Using HPLC analysis, the mount of AKBA in a sample of BSE was found to be 9.2%.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent inflammogen which causes cognitive dysfunction. Boswellia serrata is known since many years as a powerful anti-inflammatory herbal drug. Its beneficial effect mainly arises from inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) enzyme. 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is the most potent 5-LO inhibitor extracted from the oleo-gum-resin of Boswellia serrata. The aim of the present work is to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of AKBA and dexamethasone (DEX) in LPS-induced neuroinflammatory model. A single intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of LPS (0.8 mg/kg) was injected to induce cognitive dysfunction. The LPS-treated mice were administered for 7 days with either AKBA or DEX at intraperitoneal doses of 5 and 1 mg/kg, respectively. Cognitive, locomotor functions, and anxiety level were first examined. The level of the phosphorylated inhibitory protein for NF-κB, IκB-α (P-IκB-α), was measured, and the expression levels of the inflammatory microRNA-155 (miR-155) and its target gene, suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1), were determined in the brain. Moreover, the level of carbonyl proteins as a measure of oxidative stress and several cytokines as well as markers for apoptosis and amyloidogenesis was detected. Results showed that AKBA and DEX reversed the behavioral dysfunction induced by LPS. AKBA decreased P-IκB-α, miRNA-155 expression level, and carbonyl protein content. It restored normal cytokine level and increased SOCS-1 expression level. It also showed anti-apoptotic and anti-amyloidogenic effects in LPS-injected mice. These findings suggest AKBA as a therapeutic drug for alleviating the symptoms of neuroinflammatory disorders.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16773534>Modulation of Pgp function by boswellic acids.</a></h2><p>Boswellic acids, the main active ingredients of Boswellia serrata, are gaining more and more importance in the treatment of peritumoural oedema and chronic  . They may be even considered as alternative drugs to corticosteroids in reducing cerebral peritumoural oedema. An important focus for drugs acting in the central nervous system is achieving a high extent of brain penetration. Today there is increasing evidence for the importance of transporters, especially P-glycoprotein (Pgp), for drug disposition and resulting clinical response. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the concentrations of the potent keto derivatives, the  (KBA) and the acetyl- (AKBA), in proportion to boswellic acids lacking a keto group, like the beta-boswellic acid, are much lower in plasma than in the orally administered extract. Moreover the brain/plasma ratio for KBA and AKBA determined in preliminary experiments on rats was only about 0.51 and 0.81, respectively, in spite of their lipophilicity. Until now little is known about the cerebral pharmacokinetics of boswellic acids and how it may be influenced. Since many drugs are known to interact with Pgp at the level of the intestine and the blood-brain barrier the modulatory potencies of the Boswellia serrata extract of H15(R) and the major boswellic acids on the transport activity of Pgp have been determined in two in vitro assays. A human lymphocytic leukaemia cell line (VLB cells) expressing Pgp was chosen as model for human Pgp, and porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC cells) were taken as model for the blood-brain barrier using calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM) as Pgp substrate. It was found that the Boswellia extract, as well as the keto-boswellic acids inhibit the transport activity of Pgp in the micromolecular range in both cell types. No modulation was observed using those boswellic acids which have no keto group in their structure. The inhibition of Pgp at the blood-brain barrier by Boswellia extract is probably not relevant for the brain availability of other Pgp substrates, because of the low plasma levels determined for KBA and AKBA. However the presented data could not exclude the possibility of drug interactions caused by modulation of Pgp by extracts of Boswellia serrata on the gastrointestinal level.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642100>3-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid attenuated oxidative glutamate toxicity in neuron-like cell lines by apoptosis inhibition.</a></h2><p>3-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a pentacyclic triterpenic acid present in gum resin of Boswellia serrata, has been found to possess antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. In this study, we aimed to examine protective properties of AKBA against glutamate-induced neuronal injury. To investigate the effects of AKBA (2.5-10 µM) on glutamate injury in neuron-like cells PC12 and N2a, two treatment regimens (incubation for 2 or 0 hours before glutamate exposure) were used. Then, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method was used to determine viability of the cells. Cellular redox status was evaluated using fluorimetry and comet assays. Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining and Western blot analysis of relative apoptotic proteins were conducted. Based on the results, 24 hours incubation with glutamate (8 mM) increased the cell mortality of PC12 and N2a (P < .001). However, AKBA (2.5-10 µM) enhanced the cell viability in both treatment regimens (P < .001). Also co- and pretreatment with AKBA significantly attenuated lipid peroxidation, reactive  species production, and DNA injury (P < .05 and P < .001). AKBA also restored the activity of cellular superoxide dismutase under glutamate toxicity; this effect was seen to be more significant during the pretreatment regimen (P < .001). Moreover, Western blot analysis indicated that AKBA inhibited glutamate-induced programmed cell death through depressing the elevation of the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved-caspase-3 proteins, concentration-dependently. Overall, the present findings suggest the neuroprotective activities of AKBA against glutamate-induced cell injury probably by inhibiting oxidative damage and reducing apoptotic cell death.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24329130>Preparation of amorphous solid dispersions by rotary evaporation and KinetiSol Dispersing: approaches to enhance solubility of a poorly water-soluble gum extract.</a></h2><p>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a gum resin extract, possesses poor water-solubility that limits bioavailability and a high melting point making it difficult to successfully process into solid dispersions by fusion methods.

Also, BCDD decreased the activity of Bid and Bax in cytosol, caused ΔΨ(mt) loss, releasing pro-apoptotic cytochrome c, SMAC/DIABLO leading to caspase-9-mediated down stream activation of caspase-3, ICAD, and PARP1 cleavage. Translocation of apoptotis-inducing factor (AIF) from  to the nucleus indicated some caspases-independent apoptosis. Though it upregulated DR-5 and caspase-8, the caspase inhibitor yet had no effect on apoptosis as against 75% inhibition by caspase-9 inhibitor. Attempts were made to examine any acclaimed role of AIF in the activation of caspase-8 using siRNA where it had no effect on caspase-8 activity while the Bax-siRNA inhibited caspase-3 activation suggesting predominance of intrinsic signaling. Our studies thus demonstrated that BCDD exerts multi-focal action in cancer cells while it required 10-fold higher the concentration to produce cytotoxicity in normal human PBMC and gingival cell line, and therefore, may find usefulness in the management of human leukemia.Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25819335>Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of boswellic acid derivatives as potent VEGFR-2 inhibitors.</a></h2><p>A series of AKBA derivatives were synthesized, and evaluated as potent VEGFR-2 inhibitors.

We examined the effect of AKBA on human gastric carcinoma growth and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms.Inhibition of cancer cell growth was estimated by colorimetric and clonogenic assays. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry and apoptosis determined using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and DNA ladder quantification. After three weeks of oral AKBA administration in nude mice bearing cancer xenografts, animals were sacrificed and xenografts removed for TUNEL staining and western blot analysis.AKBA exhibited anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo. With oral application in mice, AKBA significantly inhibited SGC-7901 and MKN-45 xenografts without toxicity. This effect might be associated with its roles in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. The results also showed activation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p53 in  and increased cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio after AKBA treatment. Further analysis suggested that these effects might arise from AKBA's modulation of the aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Upon AKBA treatment, β-catenin expression in nuclei was inhibited, and membrane β-catenin was activated. In the same sample, active GSK3β was increased and its non-active form decreased. Levels of cyclin D1, PCNA, survivin, c-Myc, MMP-2, and MMP-7, downstream targets of Wnt/β-catenin, were inhibited.AKBA effects on human gastric carcinoma growth were associated with its activity in modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.AKBA could be useful in the treatment of gastric cancers.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

(Burseraceae) is widely used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Anti-inflammatory activity of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA) is impeded by poor oral bioavailability due to its high lipid solubility, rapid phase-1  and poor intestinal permeability.This study developed a poly-dl-lactide-co-glycolide-based nanoparticle formulation of KBA to improve its oral bioavailability and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity.KBA was isolated from the oleo-gum resin of B. serrata, and its nanoparticle formulation (KBA-NPs) was prepared by the emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method. Oral bioavailability of KBA and KBA-NPs was studied at 50 mg/kg p.o. dose in Sprague-Dawley rats, and further evaluated for in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema assay at the same dose level.The prepared KBA-NPs had a particle size of 152.6 nm with polydispersity index of 0.194, 79.7% entrapment efficiency and a cumulative 61.5% release of KBA from KBA-NPs, at 72 h. KBA-NPs showed 60.8% inhibition of rat paw oedema at 5 h as compared to 34.9% as that of KBA. The results of oral bioavailability study and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity showed 7- and 1.7-fold increase in bioavailability and anti-inflammatory activity, respectively, of KBA in KBA-NPs as compared to KBA alone.The results of improved oral bioavailability and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of KBA-NPs suggested successful development of KBA nanoparticle formulation.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26454138>Bioavailability enhancement of a BCS IV compound via an amorphous combination product containing ritonavir.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effect of ritonavir (RTV) co-administration on the bioavailability of an amorphous dispersion of acetyl- (AKBA) and to develop a pharmaceutically acceptable AKBA-RTV combination tablet.A pharmacokinetic (PK) study in rats was conducted to evaluate the influence of RTV co-administration on the oral bioavailability of an AKBA amorphous dispersion. KinetiSol was utilized to enable production of an improved RTV formulation that facilitated the development of an AKBA-RTV combination tablet. Following in-vitro characterization, the PK performance of the tablets was evaluated in male beagles.Co-administration of RTV increased oral absorption of AKBA by about fourfold over the AKBA dispersion alone and approximately 24-fold over the pure compound. The improved RTV amorphous dispersion exhibited similar purity and neutral-phase dissolution to Norvir. The AKBA-RTV combination tablets yielded a substantial increase in AKBA's bioavailability in dogs.Oral absorption of AKBA is substantially limited by intestinal CYP3A activity and poor aqueous solubility. Consequently, AKBA's oral bioavailability is maximized by administration from a supersaturating formulation in conjunction with a CYP3A inhibitor.

In the present study the growth inhibitory effect of propionyloxy derivative of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (PKBA; a semisynthetic analogue of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid) on HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells is being reported for the first time. In the preliminary studies, in vitro cytotoxicity of PKBA was investigated against eight human  cell lines viz., IMR-32, SF-295 (both neuroblastoma), PC-3 (prostate), Colo-205 (), MCF-7 (breast), OVCAR-5 (ovary), HL-60, Molt-4 (both leukemia) and their respective IC(50) values were found to be 5.95, 7.11, 15.2, 14.5, 15, 15.9, 8.7 & 9.5μg/ml, respectively. For determining the mechanism of cell death in HL-60 cells, PKBA was subjected to different mechanistic studies. DNA relaxation assay of PKBA revealed inhibition of both topoisomerases I & II. The fragmentation analysis of DNA revealed typical ladders indicating the cytotoxic effect to be mediated by induction of apoptosis. The morphologic studies of PKBA showed the presence of true apoptotic bodies. Apoptosis was confirmed further by flow-cytometric detection of sub-G(1) peaks and enhanced annexin-V-FITC binding of the cells. The activation of apoptotic cascade by PKBA in HL-60 cells was found to be associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of initiator and executioner caspases and cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). In vivo studies of PKBA revealed anti-tumoral activity against both ascitic and solid murine tumor models. These studies thus demonstrate PKBA to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells due to the inhibition of topoisomerases I and II.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway has been considered a potential target for neuroprotection in stroke. 11-Keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA) is a triterpenoid compound from extracts of Boswellia serrata. The aim of the present study was to determine whether KBA, a novel Nrf2 activator, can protect against cerebral ischemic injury. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was operated on male Sprague-Dawley rats. KBA (25 mg/kg) applied 1 h after reperfusion significantly reduced infarct volumes and apoptotic cells as well as increased neurologic scores at 48 h after reperfusion. Meanwhile, posttreatment with KBA significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, restored the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and increased the protein Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in brain tissues. In primary cultured astrocytes, KBA increased the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, which provided protection against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced oxidative insult. But knockdown of Nrf2 or HO-1 attenuated the protective effect of KBA. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence that the neuroprotection of KBA against oxidative stress-induced ischemic injury involves the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27997878>Design and synthesis of novel 2-substituted  heterocyclic derivatives as anti-prostate cancer agents with Pin1 inhibition ability.</a></h2><p>A series of novel acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) derivatives with a different electron-withdrawing group on ring A and a nitrogen heterocycle at C-24 were designed and synthesized.

Also, the available marketed formulation for intravenous administration has its inherent drawbacks owing to the presence of polysorbate 80. Here, we exploited the anticancer and P-gp inhibitory potential of naturally occurring frankincense oil to fabricate a stable docetaxel loaded nanoemulsified carrier system for oral delivery. The nanoemulsion possessing desirable particle size (122±12nm), polydispersity (0.086±0.007) and zeta potential (-29.8±2.1mV) was stable against all type of physical stresses and simulated physiological conditions tested. The formulation showed higher uptake in Caco-2 cells and inhibited P-gp transporter significantly (P<0.05). In MDA-MB-231 cells, it showed less IC, arrested cells in G2-M phase and exhibited higher degree of apoptosis than marketed formulation Taxotere. The 182.58±4.16% increment in relative oral bioavailability led to higher in vivo anti-proliferative activity manifesting 19% more inhibition than Taxotere.

The extract, used at 2.3, 4.6 and 9.3 µg/ml, had no effect, but in combination with IL-1α showed MMP-9 inhibition at the lowest dose and increased upregulation at the highest one. AKBA alone, at the same concentrations (corresponding to 5, 10, and 20 µM), did not stimulate MMP-9, but together with IL-1α induced an increased upregulation at the lowest dose that progressively disappeared at higher doses. WB analysis showed that IL-1α induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, while AKBA abolished this effect at 20 µM, but conversely increased it at 5 µM. Screening of MAP kinase phosphorylation showed a combined activation of IL-1α/AKBA on JNK, while the JNK inhibitor SP600125 abolished MMP-9 upregulation induced by IL-1α/AKBA.The enhancing effect of IL-1α/AKBA on MMP-9 at low AKBA concentration seems to involve the activation of JNK-mediated NF-κB pathway. Conversely, the extract inhibits the IL-1α effect at low doses, but not at higher ones, where AKBA and possibly other β-boswellic acids reach concentrations that potentiate the effect of IL-1α.

Boswellia serrata is a well-known powerful anti-inflammatory agent used to treat several inflammatory diseases. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of the combination therapy of 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitor and celecoxib, and a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor as dual enzyme inhibitors compared to monotherapies with celecoxib and AKBA. Cognitive dysfunction is induced by intraperational injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice. Radial maze, Y maze, and novel object recognition (NOR) were performed to evaluate the possible behavioral changes. Moreover, estimation of glutamate and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), as well as an immunohistochemical investigation of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) was performed to evaluate the molecular changes that followed the LPS or drug treatment. The results showed that the combination therapy of AKBA and celecoxib reversed the behavioral and molecular changes caused by LPS cognitive dysfunction model that predispose cognitive dysfunction in mice.

This paper describes the comparisons in plasma pharmacokinetic behaviors of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA) and 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) in FRA and its processed products, and their effects on coagulation factors and blood clotting tetrachoric, using an acute cold blood-stasis animal model after oral administration of FRA, SFF, and VPF.For pharmacokinetic study, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups, including group FRA, group SFF and group VPF. And the plasma samples were analyzed by HPLC. For study of anticoagulatory effect, SD rats were randomly divided into six groups, including control, acute cold blood-stasis model, Fu-fang-dan-shen tablet- (0.75g/kg), FRA-, SFF-, and VPF-treated (2.7g/kg) groups, respectively. The serum contents of thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), D-dimer (D-D), and prostacyclin (PGI2) of each group were measured by ELISA. The values of prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen (FIB) were also assessed by hematology analyzer.Significantly increased levels of Cmax, AUC, T1/2, and MRT were found in rats treated with the processed products. In addition, decreased levels of D-D and TAT and increased contents of PGI2 were observed in rats given FRA and its processed products, compared with that of the model group. Moreover, VPF improved anticoagulation more than SFF in the animals.The observed improvement of anticoagulation by processed FRA may result from the increased absorption and bioavailability of triterpenoids.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Up to now, the chemotherapy approaches for GBM were limited. 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), the major active ingredient of the gum resin from Boswellia serrata and Boswellia carteri Birdw., was reported to inhibit the growth of many types of  cells; however, the underlying mechanism of its anticancer effects are still unclear.The effects of AKBA on cell viability and its cytotoxicity were determined using CCK8 and LDH kits respectively. The EdU-DNA synthesis assay was used to evaluate inhibition of cell proliferation by AKBA. The role of AKBA in glioblastoma cell functions such as migration/invasion, and colony formation was evaluated using transwell chambers and soft agar, respectively. Flow cytometry and western blotting were used to detect AKBA-induced apoptosis. Potential mechanisms of AKBA action were explored by RNA sequencing and the identified hub genes were validated by real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting. Finally, the in vivo anti-tumor activity of AKBA was evaluated against a human glioblastoma cell line, U87-MG, in a xenograft mouse model.AKBA inhibited cell proliferation, caused the release of LDH, decreased DNA synthesis, and inhibited the migration, invasion, and colony formation of U251 and U87-MG human glioblastoma cell lines. AKBA increased apoptosis as well as the activity of caspase 3/7 and the protein expression of cleaved-caspase 3 and cleaved PARP, while decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential. RNA-sequencing analyses showed that AKBA suppressed the expression of pRB, FOXM1, Aurora A, PLK1, CDC25C, p-CDK1, cyclinB1, Aurora B, and TOP2A while increasing the expression of p21 and GADD45A. These findings were validated by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The data are consistent with a mechanism in which AKBA arrested the cell cycle in glioblastoma cells at the G2/M phase by regulating the p21/FOXM1/cyclin B1 pathway, inhibited mitosis by downregulating the Aurora B/TOP2A pathway, and induced mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Oral administration of AKBA (100 mg/kg) significantly suppressed the tumorigenicity of U87-MG cells in a xenograft mouse model.Taken together, these results suggest that AKBA (molecular weight, 512.7 Da) might be a promising chemotherapy drug in the treatment of GBM.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20021046>Safety and Toxicological Evaluation of a Novel, Standardized 3-O-Acetyl- (AKBA)-Enriched Boswellia serrata Extract (5-Loxin(R)).</a></h2><p>The novel anti-inflammatory properties of the gum resin derived from Boswellia serrata, also known as Salai guggal in Ayurvedic medicine, are well recognized and highly recommended for human consumption.

The main mechanism of action of RA induced bone loss is the significant inhibitory effect of TNF-α on osteoblast differentiation. TNF-α inhibits osteoblast differentiation mainly by activating nuclear factor (NF) -κB signaling pathway. Owing to the crucial role of TNF-α and NF-κB in the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation, they are considered as targets for the development of therapeutic drugs. In the present study, we evaluated the NF-κB inhibitor Boswellic acid (BA) and its derivatives in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and the molecular mechanism. Based on the cell model of TNF-α induced inhibition of osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3-E1, the regulatory role of BAs was studied. The result of MTT assay indicated that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) -2, TNF-α, or acetyl-11-keto-β-BA (AKBA) impact no significant effect for cell viability of MC3T3-E1. The results of alkaline phosphatase (ALP activity assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction indicated that AKBA blocked TNF-α-induced inhibition of the expression of osteoblast markers, suggesting that AKBA rescued osteoblast differentiation from TNF-α-induced inhibition. Additionally, AKBA stimulated the BMP-2-induced expression of osteoblast markers, suggesting that AKBA promotes osteoblast differentiation directly. The results of western blotting and luciferase assay indicated that N-κB signaling was activated by TNF-α. The overexpression of NF-κB component p65 in MC3T3-E1 was found to attenuate the positive effect of AKBA in osteoblast differentiation, suggesting that AKBA potentiates osteoblast differentiation by inhibiting NF-κB signaling. Collectively, AKBA promotes osteoblast differentiation by inhibiting TNF-α and NF-κB. Our study revealed a new discovery of AKBA in regulating osteoblast differentiation, and demonstrated that AKBA may be a potential anabolic agent in the treatment of RA-derived bone loss disease.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27346540>Pharmacological evidences for cytotoxic and antitumor properties of Boswellic acids from Boswellia serrata.</a></h2><p>Increasing research on traditional herbal medicines and their phytoconstituents has recognized their usefulness in complementary as adjuvant to chemotherapy in various types of cancers.

The oleo-gum resin of the plant has been used in traditional medicine to treat variety of conditions including inflammatory diseases like arthritis, asthma, chronic pain, bowel conditions and many other diseases. This review presents an overview of scientific studies on cytotoxic and antitumor properties of B. serrata and its constituents.Literature search was carried out for activities of B. serrata and various isolated boswellic acids such as β-boswellic acid, 11-keto-β-boswellic acid and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid reported in various cancer types in vitro as well as in vivo.The triterpenoidal fraction of B. serrata (containing boswellic acids) is responsible for the cytotoxic and antitumor properties. Among the screened compounds, 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid has been found to be most promising cytotoxic molecule.

Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is a pentacyclic triterpenic acid isolated from the fragrant gum resin of the Boswellia serrata tree, which has shown intriguing antitumor activity against human cell lines established from PCa, colon cancer, malignant glioma, and leukemia. In this study, we examined the effects of AKBA against docetaxel-resistant PCa in vitro and in vivo as well as its anticancer mechanisms. We showed that AKBA dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in docetaxel-resistant PC3/Doc cells; its IC value in anti-proliferation was ∼17 μM. Furthermore, AKBA dose-dependently suppressed the chemoresistant stem cell-like properties of PC3/Doc cells, evidenced by significant decrease in the ability of mammosphere formation and down-regulated expression of a number of stemness-associated genes. The activation of Akt and Stat3 signaling  was remarkably enhanced in PC3/Doc cells, which contributed to their chemoresistant stem-like phenotype. AKBA (10-30 μM) dose-dependently suppressed the activation of Akt and Stat3 signaling  in PC3/Doc cells. In contrast, overexpression of Akt and Stat3 significantly attenuated the inhibition of AKBA on PC3/Doc cell proliferation. In docetaxel-resistant PCa homograft mice, treatment with AKBA significantly suppresses the growth of homograft RM-1/Doc, equivalent to its human PC3/Doc, but did not decrease their body weight.

However, the mechanisms and constituents responsible for these effects are poorly understood. This study examined the effect of the Boswellia extract and its single constituent acetyl- (AKBA) on leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in an experimental model of IBD. Ileitis was induced by two subcutaneous injections of indomethacin (7.5 mg/kg) in Sprague-Dawley rats 24 h apart. Rats also received oral treatment with the Boswellia extract (H15) or AKBA at two different doses (low and high) equivalent to recommendations in human disease over 2 days.

Effects of treatment were assessed by intravital microscopy in ileal submucosal venules for changes in the number of rolling and adherent leukocytes and by macroscopic and histological scoring. Increased leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesive interactions and severe tissue injury accompanied indomethacin-induced ileitis. Treatment with the Boswellia extract or AKBA resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in rolling (up to 90%) and adherent (up to 98%) leukocytes.

All efforts to develop NSAIDs that spare the gastrointestinal tract and the cardiovasculature are still far from achieving a breakthrough. In the last two decades, preparations of the gum resin of Boswellia serrata (a traditional ayurvedic medicine) and of other Boswellia species have experienced increasing popularity in Western countries. Animal studies and pilot clinical trials support the potential of B. serrata gum resin extract (BSE) for the treatment of a variety of   like , rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and asthma. Moreover, in 2002 the European Medicines Agency classified BSE as an 'orphan drug' for the treatment of peritumoral brain oedema. Compared to NSAIDs, it is expected that the administration of BSE is associated with better tolerability, which needs to be confirmed in further clinical trials. Until recently, the pharmacological effects of BSE were mainly attributed to suppression of leukotriene formation via inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) by two boswellic acids, 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA) and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA). These two boswellic acids have also been chosen in the monograph of Indian frankincense in European Pharmacopoiea 6.0 as markers to ensure the quality of the air-dried gum resin exudate of B. serrata. Furthermore, several dietary supplements advertise the enriched content of KBA and AKBA. However, boswellic acids failed to inhibit leukotriene formation in human whole blood, and pharmacokinetic data revealed very low concentrations of AKBA and KBA in plasma, being far below the effective concentrations for bioactivity in vitro. Moreover, permeability studies suggest poor absorption of AKBA following oral administration. In view of these results, the previously assumed mode of action - that is, 5-LO inhibition - is questionable. On the other hand, 100-fold higher plasma concentrations have been determined for β-boswellic acid, which inhibits microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 and the serine protease cathepsin G. Thus, these two enzymes might be reasonable molecular targets related to the anti- properties of BSE. In view of the results of clinical trials and the experimental data from in vitro studies of BSE, and the available pharmacokinetic and metabolic data on boswellic acids, this review presents different perspectives and gives a differentiated insight into the possible mechanisms of action of BSE in humans. It underlines BSE as a promising alternative to NSAIDs, which warrants investigation in further pharmacological studies and clinical trials.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammatory bowel disease']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25851251>Development and optimisation of 3-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid loaded poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid-nanoparticles with enhanced oral bioavailability and in-vivo anti-inflammatory activity in rats.</a></h2><p>3-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is a potent anti-inflammatory compound of Boswellia serrata.

Although therapies directed toward vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) represent a significant step forward in the treatment of proliferative retinopathies, further improvements are needed. In the last few years, an intense research activity has focused around the use of herbal and traditional natural medicines as an alternative for slowing down the progression of proliferative retinopathies. In the present study, we investigated the antiangiogenic effects of acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), one of the active principles derived from the plant Boswellia serrata, used in Ayurvedic systems of medicine. We studied the antiangiogenic properties of AKBA using the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), which mimics the neovascular response seen in human retinopathy of prematurity. We first evaluated the effects of subcutaneously administered AKBA on the expression/activity of proteins which are known to play a role in the OIR model. In the retina, AKBA increased expression and activity of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 and reduced the phosphorylation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as well as VEGF expression and VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 phosphorylation. Likely as a result of these effects, AKBA significantly reduced retinal neovascularization in OIR mice without affecting retinal cell survival and retinal function. Using retinal explants cultured in hypoxia and an activator of STAT3 phosphorylation, we showed that the AKBA-induced inhibition of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation is likely to be mediated by a mechanism depending on an SHP-1/STAT3/VEGF axis. In the OIR model, neovascularization results from the activation of retinal endothelial cells, therefore we evaluated whether AKBA affected the angiogenic response of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). We observed that AKBA reduced proliferation, migration and tube formation in HRMECs stimulated with exogenous VEGF, while it reduced migration and tube formation in untreated HRMECs. Taken together, our results demonstrate the antiangiogenic effects of AKBA in a model of pathologic neovascularization, providing a rationale for further investigation of AKBA as a promising therapeutic agent to reduce the impact of proliferative retinopathies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Lower percentages of BAs content were obtained when BAs were expressed on the gum resin weight (29% and 16% for B. sacra and B. serrata, respectively). The content of Acetyl-11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid (AKBA) was higher in B. sacra (70.81 g·kg-1 d. wt; 7%) than in B. serrata (7.35 g·kg-1 d. wt; 0.7%). Our results show that any claim of BAs content in either B. sacra or B. serrata gum resins equal to or higher than 70% or AKBA contents of 30% are simply unrealistic or based on a wrong quantitative determination.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28759942>11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid Inhibits Lymphocyte (CD3) Infiltration Into Pancreatic Islets of Young None Obese Diabetic (NOD) Mice.</a></h2><p>11-Keto-β-Boswellic acid (KBA) has been shown to prevent infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells in an animal model of autoimmune  caused by injection of Multiple Low Doses of Streptozotocin (MLD-STZ), which is a chemical compound belonging to the class of nitrososureas. The aim of this work was to study whether or not KBA can also prevent/attenuate infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells in an animal model of autoimmune  caused by genetic dysfunction resembling human type 1  in several important features. Four weeks old female NOD mice received daily i.p. injections of 7.5 mg/kg of KBA over a period of 3 weeks. Compared to 4 weeks old animals there was significant infiltration of lymphocytes (CD3) into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells in the period between 4 and 7 weeks. During this time plasma glucose dropped significantly and body weight did not increase. As far as pro-inflammatory cytokines are concerned, except a small increase of IFN-γ, there was no change in the blood. In mice that had been treated with KBA between 4 and 7 weeks after birth no significant infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells was observed, when compared to 4 weeks old mice. Moreover, there was no drop of blood glucose and the animals gained body weight. It is concluded that - similar to the model of MLD-STZ- - also in the NOD mouse model KBA is able to attenuate or even prevent development of insulitis, suggesting that KBA protects islets from autoimmune reaction regardless whether the signal is provided by a chemical compound or by genetic dysfunction. Whether this also holds for human type 1  remains to be established.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'inflammation', 'metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27545217>Reversal of the multidrug resistance of human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cells by acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid via downregulation of P-glycoprotein signals.</a></h2><p>Multidrug resistance (MDR) represents a clinical obstacle to cancer chemotherapy since it causes cancer recurrence and metastasis. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), an active ingredient derived from the plant Boswellia serrata, has been found to inhibit the growth of a wide variety of tumor cells, including glioma, colorectal cancer, leukemia, human melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate cancer cells. However, the actions of AKBA in multidrug-resistant cancer cells have not been fully elucidated. The current study examined the reversal of MDR by AKBA in a human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cell line with vincristine-induced resistance, HCT-8/VCR. A 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that cytotoxicity increased drastically and the IC50 of VCR in HCT-8/VCR cells decreased in the presence of AKBA. AKBA had a maximum "fold reversal" of MDR (FR) of 9.19-fold. In addition, HCT-8/VCR cells treated with AKBA and VCR exhibited a higher percentage of apoptotic tumor cells according to flow cytometry. The reversal of MDR by AKBA was evident in an intracellular increase in Rhodamine (Rh123), indicating that the activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was blocked. Furthermore, AKBA inhibited the expression of P-gp and decreased levels of expression of multidrug resistance gene 1 in HCT-8/VCR cells.

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of a Boswellia serrata gum resin extract (BSE) on intestinal motility and diarrhoea in rodents. BSE depressed electrically-, acetylcholine-, and barium chloride-induced contractions in the isolated guinea-pig ileum, being more potent in inhibiting the contractions induced by acetylcholine and barium chloride. The inhibitory effect of BSE on acetylcholine-induced contractions was reduced by the L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers verapamil and nifedipine, but not by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid, by the phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitor rolipram or by the lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton. 3-acetyl-, one of the main active ingredients of B. serrata, inhibited acetylcholine-induced contractions. BSE inhibited upper gastrointestinal transit in croton oil-treated mice as well as castor oil-induced diarrhoea. However, BSE did not affect intestinal motility in control mice, both in the small and in the large intestine.

AKBA was assayed, employing an accurate and sensitive HPLC method. Detection was carried out at 210 nm using UV/Vis detector. A solubility study for the bioactive fraction was conducted. Microcrystalline cellulose and Aeroperl®300 Pharma were used as carrier and coating materials. Angle of slide, liquid load factor and Carr's flow index were estimated. Six systems were prepared using polyethylene glycol 400, solvent and two drug loading concentrations; 20 and 40 %. For each concentration, three carrier: coat ratios were dispensed; 20:1, 10:1, and 5:1. Dissolution study was performed and two systems were selected for characterization and in vivo evaluation by investigating upper GIT ulcerogenic effect and anti- efficacy in rats.

Cerebral ischemia is a major cause of endothelial dysfunction which can disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)/reperfusion promote cell death and BBB breakdown in brain endothelial cells. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a biologically active phytoconstituent of the medicinal plant Boswellia serrata, has been shown to be protective against various inflammatory diseases as well as ischemic brain injury. The molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial characteristics of AKBA are poorly understood. We subjected bEND.3 cells to OGD/reperfusion to investigate the protective role of AKBA in this model. We found that AKBA treatment attenuated endothelial cell death and oxidative stress assessed by means of TUNEL assay, cleaved-caspase-3, and dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. Furthermore, OGD downregulated  proteins ZO-1 and Occludin levels, and increased the expressions of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, ICAM-1, and complement C3a receptor (C3aR). We also noticed the increased phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in bEND.3 cells in OGD group. AKBA treatment significantly attenuated expression levels of these inflammatory proteins and prevented the degradation of ZO-1 and Occludin following OGD. In conclusion, AKBA treatment provides protection against endothelial cell dysfunction following OGD by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'oxygen', 'tight junction']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881407>Quantification of AKBA in Boswellia sacra Using NIRS Coupled with PLSR as an Alternative Method and Cross-Validation by HPLC.</a></h2><p>3-O-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), one of the pentacyclic triterpenoids, is the main biologically active constituent in the resin of Boswellia sacra and has received significant pharmacological interest in recent years.It was aimed to develop a robust method to quantify the AKBA content in methanolic extracts of different parts of B. sacra plants and in various fractions of its resin exudates through near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) coupled with partial least squares regression (PLSR).The near-infrared (NIR) spectra were used to measure the AKBA standards and B. sacra samples at a wavelength range between 700 and 2500 nm in absorption mode. A PLSR model was built from the obtained spectral data using 70% of the AKBA working standard solutions (training set), ranging from 0.1 ppm to 100 ppm. The final PLSR showed a R value of 99% with a root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) value of 0.39% and a R value of 99%.The results showed that a 50% CHCl /n-hexane sub-fraction has the highest concentration of AKBA (14.8%), followed by 55% CHCl /n-hexane (13.6%), and 40% CHCl /n-hexane (6.1%).As the results achieved with the proposed NIRS methodology are in close agreement to the results of AKBA analysis using HPLC, we suggest that our proposed NIRS method is a fast alternative and non-destructive method for the analysis of AKBA in different samples of B. sacra.

A subgroup of boswellic acids, characterized by an 11-keto group, elevates intracellular Ca concentrations [Ca] and causes moderate aggregation of human platelets. How different BAs and their mixtures in pharmacological preparations affect these parameters in activated platelets has not been addressed, so far. Here, we show that boswellic acids either antagonize or induce Ca mobilization and platelet aggregation depending on defined structural determinants with inductive effects predominating for a  gum resin extract. 3--Acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid potently suppressed Ca mobilization (IC = 6 µM) and aggregation (IC = 1 µM) when platelets were activated by collagen or the thromboxane A receptor agonist U-46619, but not upon thrombin. In contrast, -boswellic acid and 3--acetyl--boswellic acid, which lack the 11-keto moiety, were weak inhibitors of agonist-induced platelet responses, but instead they elicited elevation of [Ca] and aggregation of platelets (≥ 3 µM). 11-Keto--boswellic acid, the structural intermediate between 3--acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid and -boswellic acid, was essentially inactive independent of the experimental conditions.

This study demonstrates that treatment with a novel cyano derivative of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid, i.e. butyl 2-cyano-3, 11-dioxours-1,12-dien-24-oate (BCDD) reduced the viral E6 mRNA expression and lead to the accumulation of transcriptionally active p53 in the nucleus of HPV18 HeLa cells following DNA damage. Western blot analysis showed that BCDD robustly up regulated time-dependent expression of p53/PUMA/p21 whereas it deprived cells essentially of p-AKT and NF-κB cell survival signalling cascade. BCDD appeared to gear up PUMA activation through p53 pathway and that both p53 and p21 translocated heavily into the nucleus. Simultaneously, it inhibited anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, augumented Drp-1 expression, disrupted mitochondrial functions causing the activation of proapoptotic proteins and caspases activation. Additionally, BCDD inhibited telomerase expression that's likely to result in a marked reduction of the tumorigenic potential of high-grade cervical cancers. Consequently BCDD caused apoptotic death in cervical cancer cells as evidenced by DNA fragmentation and PARP-cleavage. Further, BCDD did not affect the extrinsic signalling transduction pathway as depicted by its null effect on caspase-8. The in vivo anticancer activity of BCDD was investigated in Ehrlich Ascites carcinoma model where it exhibited tumor regression by 48% at 30 mg/kg, i.p., in mice.

Evidence has shown that  contributes to Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, boswellic acid derivatives have also been shown to be involved in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, the interaction of four different derivatives of boswellic acid with 5-lipoxygenase enzyme was investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. The simulation of the enzyme was also carried out alone. Calculation of Cα-RMSD indicates that the enzyme stability is slightly affected by boswellic acid derivatives. Calculating the radius of gyration of the enzyme also shows that the overall shape of the protein is not affected by ligands. The RMSF values of the enzyme residues were calculated in the presence of boswellic acid derivatives and it was compared with that in the absence of ligands. The results show that the flexibility of the enzyme residues is influenced by ligands. The residues, whose flexibility is reduced, are scattered throughout the enzyme. However, their number is great in the N-terminal residue. The binding affinity between boswellic acid derivatives and the enzyme residues was calculated using the measure of conformation factor.

Although various anti-inflammatory modes of action have been proposed for BAs, the pharmacological profile of these compounds is still incompletely understood. Here, we describe the identification of human LL-37 as functional target of BAs. In unbiased target fishing experiments using immobilized BAs as bait and human neutrophils as target source, LL-37 was identified as binding partner assisted by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Thermal stability experiments using circular dichroism spectroscopy confirm direct interaction between BAs and LL-37. Of interest, this binding of BAs resulted in an inhibition of the functionality of LL-37. Thus, the LPS-neutralizing properties of isolated LL-37 were inhibited by 3-O-acetyl-β-BA (Aβ-BA) and 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-BA (AKβ-BA) in a cell-free limulus amoebocyte lysate assay with EC50=0.2 and 0.8 μM, respectively. Also, LL-37 activity was inhibited by these BAs in LL-37-enriched supernatants of stimulated neutrophils or human plasma derived from stimulated human whole blood.

BSE and AKBA safety was demonstrated by no alteration of intestinal cell viability and barrier function and integrity biomarkers. H2O2 or INF-γ+TNF-α treatment of Caco-2 cell monolayers significantly reduced TEER, increased paracellular permeability and caused the disassembly of tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1. BSE and AKBA pretreatment significantly prevented functional and morphological alterations and also the NF-κB phosphorylation induced by the  stimuli. At the same concentrations BSE and AKBA counteracted the increase of ROS caused by H2O2 exposure. Data showed the positive correlation of the antioxidant activity with the mechanism involved in the physiologic maintenance of the integrity and function of the intestinal epithelium. This study elucidates the pharmacological mechanisms mediated by BSE, in protecting intestinal epithelial barrier from  damage and supports its use as safe adjuvant in patients affected by IBD.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function', 'inflammation', 'inflammatory bowel disease', 'metabolism', 'oxygen', 'tight junction']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23850473>Acetyl- (AKBA) prevents human  adenocarcinoma growth through modulation of multiple signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Acetyl- (AKBA) is a derivative of boswellic acid. We have previously reported that AKBA can reduce the number and size of  adenomatous polyps in the APC(Min/+) mouse model. In this study, we evaluated the effect of AKBA on human  adenocarcinoma growth. Its efficacy and toxicity were compared with those of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin.The inhibition of  cell growth was estimated by colorimetric and clonogenic assay. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by the flow cytometry assay. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and JC-1 fluorescence probe assays were performed to determine the apoptotic cells. Further experiment was carried out in mice with HT-29 xenografts. AKBA was orally administered for 24days. The HT-29 xenografts were removed for TUNEL staining and western blotting analysis. Blood was obtained for clinical chemical analysis, and samples of organs were sectioned for microscopic assessment.AKBA significantly inhibited human  adenocarcinoma growth, showing arrest of the cell cycle in G1-phase and induction of apoptosis. AKBA administration in mice effectively delayed the growth of HT-29 xenografts without signs of toxicity. The activity of AKBA was more potent than that of aspirin. Western blotting suggested that this activity may arise from its multiple effects on the activation of apoptotic proteins, suppression of inflammatory cytokines and modulation of EGFR and ATM/P53 signaling pathways in the HT-29 xenografts.AKBA prevents the growth of  adenocarcinoma through modulation of multiple signaling pathways.AKBA could be a promising agent in the prevention of  adenocarcinomas.© 2013.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21992439>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA); targeting oral cavity pathogens.</a></h2><p>Boswellic acids mixture of triterpenic acids obtained from the oleo gum resin of Boswellia serrata and known for its effectiveness in the treatment of chronic   including peritumor edema. Boswellic acids have been extensively studied for a number of activities including anti , antitumor, immunomodulatory, and . The present study describes the antimicrobial activities of boswellic acid molecules against oral cavity pathogens. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), which exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity, was further evaluated in time kill studies, mutation prevention frequency, postantibiotic effect (PAE) and biofilm susceptibility assay against oral cavity pathogens.AKBA exhibited an inhibitory effect on all the oral cavity pathogens tested (MIC of 2-4 μg/ml). It exhibited concentration dependent killing of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 up to 8 × MIC and also prevented the emergence of mutants of S.mutans ATCC 25175 at 8× MIC. AKBA demonstrated postantibiotic effect (PAE) of 5.7 ± 0.1 h at 2 × MIC. Furthermore, AKBA inhibited the formation of biofilms generated by S.mutans and Actinomyces viscosus and also reduced the preformed biofilms by these bacteria.AKBA can be useful compound for the development of antibacterial agent against oral pathogens and it has great potential for use in mouthwash for preventing and treating oral infections.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammatory bowel disease']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28110820>Synthesis of new analogs of AKBA and evaluation of their anti-inflammatory activities.</a></h2><p>A new series of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid and 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid analogs (5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 18a-d, 27a-c, 28a-d) were synthesized by modification of hydroxyl and acid functional moieties of boswellic acids.

The current standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM patients involves maximal surgical debulking, followed by radiation therapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. Despite the advances in GBM therapy, its outcome remains poor with a median survival of less than two years. This poor outcome is partly due to the ability of GBM tumors to acquire adaptive resistance to therapy and in particular to radiation. One of the mechanisms contributing to GBM tumor progression and resistance is an aberrant activation of NF-ĸB, a family of inducible transcription factors that play a pivotal role in regulation of many immune, inflammatory and carcinogenic responses. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is a pentacyclic terpenoid extracted from the gum Ayurvedic therapeutic plant Boswellia serrata. AKBA is anti-inflammatory agent that exhibits potent cytotoxic activities against various types of tumors including GBM. One of the mechanisms underlying AKBA anti-tumor activity is its ability to modulate the NF-ĸB signaling pathway. The present study investigated in vitro and in vivo the effect of combining AKBA with ionizing radiation in the treatment of GBM and assessed AKBA anti-tumor activity and radio-enhancing potential. The effect of AKBA and/or radiation on the survival of cultured glioblastoma cancer cells was evaluated by XTT assay. The mode of interaction of treatments tested was calculated using CalcuSyn software. Inducing of apoptosis following AKBA treatment was evaluated using flow cytometry. The effect of combined treatment on the expression of PARP protein was analysed by Western blot assay. Ectopic (subcutaneous) GBM model in nude mice was used for the evaluation of the effect of combined treatment on tumor growth. Immunohistochemical analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor sections was used to assess treatment-related changes in Ki-67, CD31, p53, Bcl-2 and NF-ĸB-inhibitor IĸB-α. AKBA treatment was found to inhibit the survival of all four tested cell lines in a dose dependent manner. The combined treatment resulted in a more significant inhibitory effect compared to the effect of treatment with radiation alone. A synergistic effect was detected in some of the tested cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining of AKBA treated cells indicated induction of apoptosis. AKBA apoptotic activity was also confirmed by PARP cleavage detected by Western blot analysis. The combined treatment suppressed tumor growth in vivo compared to no treatment and each treatment alone. Immunohistochemical analysis showed anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative activity of AKBA in vivo. It also demonstrated a decrease in p53 nuclear staining and in Bcl-2 staining and an increase in IĸB-α staining following AKBA treatment both alone and in combination with radiotherapy. In this study, we demonstrated that AKBA exerts potent anti-proliferative and apoptotic activity, and significantly inhibits both the survival of glioblastoma cells in vitro and the growth of tumors generated by these cells. Combination of AKBA with radiotherapy was found to inhibit factors which involved in cell death regulation, tumor progression and radioresistence, therefore it may serve as a novel approach for GBM patients.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27515127>Aqueous and Ethanolic Extracts of Boswellia serrata Protect Against Focal Cerebral Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury in Rats.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress and cell apoptosis play major roles in neuronal injury after ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury. Boswellia serrata is a medicinal plant with antioxidant properties. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is an active triterpenoid compound from B. serrate. In the current study, the neuroprotective effects of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of B. serrata (named ABS and EBS, respectively) and AKBA were investigated against middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced cerebral I-R injury in rats. ABS and EBS with doses of 125, 250 and 500 and AKBA with a dose of 50 mg/kg were administered (intraperitoneally) just after middle cerebral artery occlusion induction for 30 min and reperfusion for 24 h. HPLC analysis suggested that ABS and EBS had AKBA of 8.8% and 9.5% (w/w), respectively. B. serrata and AKBA significantly improved neurological deficit and reduced brain infarction, neuronal cell loss and apoptosis and also attenuated lipid peroxidation while increasing glutathione content and superoxide dismutase activity in the cerebral cortex following a stroke. Apoptosis suppression was found to be mediated through regulating caspase-3 and bax/bcl-2 expressions. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that B. serrata and AKBA attenuate oxidative damage and inhibit cell apoptosis, subsequently protecting cerebral I-R injury in rats.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30084990>Chemoprevention of inflammation-related colorectal  by silymarin-, acetyl--, curcumin- and maltodextrin-enriched dietetic formulation in animal model.</a></h2><p>On the basis of preliminary in vitro experience, we assessed whether an enriched nutritional formulation with estrogen receptor (ER)-beta agonist and anti-inflammatory properties may prevent inflammation-associated colorectal  (CRC) in an animal model. Study sample enclosed 110 C57BL/6J male mice. Forty underwent dietary supplement safety assessment (20 standard diet and 20 enriched formulation). Seventy were treated with azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium and divided into two groups: 35 received standard diet and 35 enriched formulation (curcumin, boswellic acids, silymarin and maltodextrins). Miniature colonoscopy demonstrated colitis and solid lesion development in five mice/group 100 days after first AOM injection. Mice were killed after 10 days. In each group, four subgroups received intraperitoneal bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) injection at 24th/48th/72nd/96th hour before killing. Anti-inflammatory effect and chemoprevention were evaluated by lesion number/size, histological inflammation/dysplasia/neoplasia assessment, pro-inflammatory cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA), ER-beta/ER-alpha/BrdU immunohistochemistry and TUNEL immunofluorescence. Standard formulation assumption was associated with  shortening compared with enriched one (P = 0.04), which reduced solid lesion number and size (P < 0.001 for both), histological inflammation score (P = 0.04), pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression (P < 0.001), number of low-grade dysplasia (LGD; P = 0.03) and high-grade dysplasia (P < 0.001) areas. CRC was observed in 69.6% in standard and 23.5% in enriched formulation assuming animals (P < 0.001). Enriched formulation induced lower ER-alpha expression in CRC (P < 0.001) and higher ER-beta expression in LGD (P < 0.001) being associated to higher epithelial turnover (BrdU; P<0.001) in normal mucosa and increased apoptosis in LGD and CRC (P < 0.001 for both). Our results are promising for a successful anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive effect of enriched formulation in CRC arising from inflamed tissue.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer', 'inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21702037>Boswellic acid inhibits growth and metastasis of human colorectal cancer in orthotopic mouse model by downregulating inflammatory, proliferative, invasive and angiogenic biomarkers.</a></h2><p>Numerous cancer therapeutics were originally identified from natural products used in traditional medicine. One such agent is acetyl- (AKBA), derived from the gum resin of the Boswellia serrata known as Salai guggal or Indian frankincense. Traditionally, it has been used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat proinflammatory conditions. In this report, we hypothesized that AKBA can affect the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) in orthotopically implanted tumors in nude mice. We found that the oral administration of AKBA (50-200 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited the growth of CRC tumors in mice, resulting in decrease in tumor volumes than those seen in vehicle-treated mice without significant decreases in . In addition, we observed that AKBA was highly effective in suppressing ascites and distant metastasis to the liver, lungs and spleen in orthotopically implanted tumors in nude mice. When examined for the mechanism, we found that markers of tumor proliferation index Ki-67 and the microvessel density cluster of differentiation (CD31) were significantly downregulated by AKBA treatment. We also found that AKBA significantly suppressed nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in the tumor tissue and expression of proinflammatory (cyclooxygenase-2), tumor survival (bcl-2, bcl-xL, inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP-1) and survivin), proliferative (cyclin D1), invasive (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9) and angiogenic C-X-C (CXC) receptor 4 and vascular endothelial growth factor) biomarkers. When examined for serum and tissue levels of AKBA, a dose-dependent increase in the levels of the drug was detected, indicating its bioavailability. Thus, our findings suggest that this boswellic acid analog can inhibit the growth and metastasis of human CRC in vivo through downregulation of cancer-associated biomarkers.Copyright © 2011 UICC.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15643550>Effect of food intake on the bioavailability of boswellic acids from a herbal preparation in healthy volunteers.</a></h2><p>In this study we investigated the effects of concomitant food intake on the bioavailability of distinct boswellic acids (BAs) from the test preparation BSE-018, a dry extract from Boswellia serrata gum resin. In a randomised, open, single-dose, two-way crossover study, healthy male subjects received three capsules of BSE-018 equivalent to 786 mg dry extract of Boswellia serrata gum resin either in the fasted state or together with a standardised high-fat meal. BA plasma concentrations were analysed for up to 60 h after oral dosing by reversed phase HPLC. As compared to the fasted state (treatment A), the administration of BSE-018 concomitantly with a high-fat meal (treatment B) led to several-fold increased areas under the plasma concentration-time curves as well as peak concentrations of beta-boswellic acid (betaBA),  (KbetaBA) and acetyl- (AKbetaBA). Plasma levels of both acetyl-alpha-boswellic acid (AalphaBA) and alphaBA became only detectable when administered with treatment B, i.e., the high-fat meal. Accordingly, pharmacokinetic data could be calculated for betaBA, KbetaBA and AKbetaBA (treatment A) and for betaBA, KbetaBA, AKbetaBA, alphaBA, and AalphaBA (treatment B). For the first time these data reveal detailed kinetics of BAs after oral dosing of an extract and demonstrate a profound effect of food intake on the pharmacokinetic profile of the BAs. This finding should be very important whenever BAs would be considered for therapeutic use.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18796232>A simple high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the estimation of boswellic acids from the market formulations containing Boswellia serrata extract.</a></h2><p>A simple, rapid, and reproducible reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method is developed for the estimation of boswellic acids, the active constituents in Boswellia serrata oleo-gum resin.
