Gonzales. Association between plasma N-acylethanolamides and high hemoglobin concentration in Southern Peruvian highlanders. High Alt Med Biol 18:322-329, 2017.-High-altitude (HA) hypoxia is a stressful condition endured by organisms through different mechanisms. Failing to adapt to chronic HA exposure leads to a disease called chronic mountain sickness (CMS) characterized by excessive erythrocytosis (hemoglobin [Hb] ≥19 g/dL for women and ≥21 g/dL for men). Genes encoding for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) subunits α and γ have been proposed as candidate genes for HA adaptation. N-acylethanolamides (NAEs) are endogenous fatty acid substances that bind to PPAR-α and -γ. NAEs are also able to modulate the endocannabinoid system, a signaling pathway activated in physiological stressful conditions. In the frame of a metabolomic study, we measured plasma levels of four NAEs: palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), stearoyl ethanolamide (SEA), and linoleoyl ethanolamide (LEA) in natives from Puno (3830 m), a city located in the Peruvian Southern Andes, and Lima (150 m). All NAEs were significantly higher in the HA population (p < 0.001, q < 0.001). Subjects with higher NAE values were those with higher Hb concentration and lower pulse  saturation. However, there was no association between NAEs and CMS score. Our results suggest that PEA and OEA could be involved in physiological regulation following long-term HA exposure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29566737>Murine breast cancer feed arteries are thin-walled with reduced α-adrenoceptor expression and attenuated sympathetic vasocontraction.</a></h1><p>Perfusion of breast cancer tissue limits  availability and metabolism but angiogenesis inhibitors have hitherto been unsuccessful for breast cancer therapy. In order to identify abnormalities and possible therapeutic targets in mature cancer arteries, we here characterize the structure and function of cancer feed arteries and corresponding control arteries from female FVB/N mice with ErbB2-induced breast cancer.We investigated the contractile function of breast cancer feed arteries and matched control arteries by isometric myography and evaluated membrane potentials and intracellular [Ca] using sharp electrodes and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Arterial wall structure is assessed by transmission light microscopy of arteries mounted in wire myographs and by evaluation of histological sections using the unbiased stereological disector technique. We determined the expression of messenger RNA by reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and studied receptor expression by confocal microscopy of arteries labelled with the BODIPY-tagged α-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin.Breast cancer feed arteries are thin-walled and produce lower tension than control arteries of similar diameter in response to norepinephrine, thromboxane-analog U46619, endothelin-1, and depolarization with elevated [K]. Fewer layers of similarly-sized vascular smooth muscle cells explain the reduced media thickness of breast cancer arteries. Evidenced by lower media stress, norepinephrine-induced and thromboxane-induced tension development of breast cancer arteries is reduced more than is explained by the thinner media. Conversely, media stress during stimulation with endothelin-1 and elevated [K] is similar between breast cancer and control arteries. Correspondingly, vascular smooth muscle cell depolarizations and intracellular Ca responses are attenuated in breast cancer feed arteries during norepinephrine but not during endothelin-1 stimulation. Protein expression of α-adrenoceptors and messenger RNA levels for α-adrenoceptors are lower in breast cancer arteries than control arteries. Sympathetic vasocontraction elicited by electrical field stimulation is inhibited by α-adrenoceptor blockade and reduced in breast cancer feed arteries compared to control arteries.Thinner media and lower α-adrenoceptor expression weaken contractions of breast cancer feed arteries in response to sympathetic activity. We propose that abnormalities in breast cancer arteries can be exploited to modify tumor perfusion and thereby either starve cancer cells or facilitate drug and  delivery during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30371952>Heliox for croup in children.</a></h1><p>Croup is an acute viral respiratory infection with upper airway mucosal inflammation that may cause respiratory distress. Most cases are mild. Moderate to severe croup may require treatment with corticosteroids (from which benefits are often delayed) and nebulised epinephrine (adrenaline) (which may be short-lived and can cause dose-related adverse effects including tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypertension). Rarely, croup results in respiratory failure necessitating emergency intubation and ventilation.A mixture of helium and  (heliox) may prevent morbidity and mortality in ventilated neonates by reducing the viscosity of the inhaled air. It is currently used during emergency transport of children with severe croup. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it relieves respiratory distress.This review updates versions published in 2010 and 2013.To examine the effect of heliox compared to  or other active interventions, placebo, or no treatment, on relieving signs and symptoms in children with croup as determined by a croup score and rates of admission and intubation.We searched CENTRAL, which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; and LILACS in January and February 2018. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov) on 8 February 2018. We contacted British  Company, a leading supplier of heliox (BOC Australia 2017).Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing the effect of heliox in comparison with placebo or any active intervention(s) in children with croup.We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We reported data that could not be pooled for statistical analysis descriptively.We included 3 RCTs with 91 children aged between 6 months and 4 years. Study duration was from 7 to 16 months; all studies were conducted in emergency departments in the USA (two studies) and Spain. Heliox was administered as a mixture of 70% heliox and 30% . Risk of bias was low in two studies and high in one study due to an open-label design. We added no new trials for this update.One study of 15 children with mild croup compared heliox with 30% humidified  administered for 20 minutes. There may be no difference in croup score changes between groups at 20 minutes (mean difference (MD) -0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.36 to 0.70). The mean croup score at 20 minutes postintervention may not differ between groups (MD -0.57, 95% CI -1.46 to 0.32). There may be no difference between groups in mean respiratory rate (MD 6.40, 95% CI -1.38 to 14.18) and mean heart rate (MD 14.50, 95% CI -8.49 to 37.49) at 20 minutes. The evidence for all outcomes in this comparison was of low quality, downgraded for serious imprecision. All children were discharged, but information on hospitalisation, intubation, or re-presenting to emergency departments was not reported.In another study, 47 children with moderate croup received one dose of oral dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg) with either heliox for 60 minutes or no treatment. Heliox may slightly improve croup scores at 60 minutes postintervention (MD -1.10, 95% CI -1.96 to -0.24), but there may be no difference between groups at 120 minutes (MD -0.70, 95% CI -4.86 to 3.46). Children treated with heliox may have lower mean Taussig croup scores at 60 minutes (MD -1.11, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.17) but not at 120 minutes (MD -0.71, 95% CI -1.72 to 0.30). Children treated with heliox may have lower mean respiratory rates at 60 minutes (MD -4.94, 95% CI -9.66 to -0.22), but there may be no difference at 120 minutes (MD -3.17, 95% CI -7.83 to 1.49). There may be no difference in hospitalisation rates between groups (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.41). We assessed the evidence for all outcomes in this comparison as of low quality, downgraded due to imprecision and high risk of bias related to open-label design. Information on heart rate and intubation was not reported.In the third study, 29 children with moderate to severe croup received intramuscular dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg) and either heliox with one to two doses of nebulised saline, or 100%  with one to two doses of adrenaline for three hours. Heliox may slightly improve croup scores at 90 minutes postintervention, but may have little or no difference overall using repeated measures analysis. We assessed the evidence for all outcomes in this comparison as of low quality, downgraded due to high risk of bias related to inadequate reporting. Information on hospitalisation or re-presenting to the emergency department was not reported.The included studies did not report on adverse events, intensive care admissions, or parental anxiety.We could not pool the available data because each comparison included data from only one study.Due to very limited evidence, uncertainty remains about the effectiveness and safety of heliox. Heliox may not be more effective than 30% humidified  for children with mild croup, but may be beneficial in the short term for children with moderate to severe croup treated with dexamethasone. The effect may be similar to 100%  given with one or two doses of adrenaline. Adverse events were not reported, and it is unclear if these were monitored in the included studies. Adequately powered RCTs comparing heliox with standard treatments are needed to further assess the role of heliox in the treatment of children with moderate to severe croup.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30051353>Loss of Brain Norepinephrine Elicits Neuroinflammation-Mediated Oxidative Injury and Selective Caudo-Rostral Neurodegeneration.</a></h1><p>Environmental toxicant exposure has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinical manifestations of non-motor and motor symptoms in PD stem from decades of progressive neurodegeneration selectively afflicting discrete neuronal populations along a caudo-rostral axis. However, recapitulating this spatiotemporal neurodegenerative pattern in rodents has been unsuccessful. The purpose of this study was to generate such animal PD models and delineate mechanism underlying the ascending neurodegeneration. Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal death in mice brains were measured at different times following a single systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We demonstrate that LPS produced an ascending neurodegeneration that temporally afflicted neurons initially in the locus coeruleus (LC), followed by substantia nigra, and lastly the primary motor cortex and hippocampus. To test the hypothesis that LPS-elicited early loss of noradrenergic LC neurons may underlie this ascending pattern, we used a neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) to deplete brain norepinephrine. DSP-4 injection resulted in a time-dependent ascending degenerative pattern similar to that generated by the LPS model. Mechanistic studies revealed that increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-2 (NOX2)-dependent superoxide/reactive  species (ROS) production plays a key role in both LPS- and DSP-4-elicited neurotoxicity. We found that toxin-elicited chronic neuroinflammation, oxidative neuronal injuries, and neurodegeneration were greatly suppressed in mice deficient in NOX2 gene or treated with NOX2-specific inhibitor. Our studies document the first rodent PD model recapturing the ascending neurodegenerative pattern of PD patients and provide convincing evidence that the loss of brain norepinephrine is critical in initiating and maintaining chronic neuroinflammation and the discrete neurodegeneration in PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30334980>A case report of unexpected sudden cardiac death due to aortic rupture following laparoscopic appendectomy.</a></h1><p>Aortic dissection is a very rare but life-threatening condition associated with a high mortality. Unexpected sudden cardiac death due to aortic rupture following laparoscopic appendectomy is very rare and may be difficult to diagnose. However, early diagnosis of aortic dissection is essential for the timely treatment and outcome of aortic dissection.A 50-year-old man underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy. Postoperatively, the patient complained of dyspnea and chest pain. In 25 minutes after arrival in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), the patient was in asystole. Then, he underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) according to advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol using 1 mg of epinephrine, one 200J DC shock for ventricular fibrillation (V-fib). After that, his noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) was 80/40 mm Hg, pulse rate (PR) was 140 beats/min, and peripheral  saturation (SpO2) was 84%. His electrocardiogram (ECG) finding was atrial fibrillation (A-fib). After 20 minutes, the patient developed asystole rhythm again and CPR was restarted. He remained severely hypotensive despite vasopressors and died after 5 hours CPR. A forensic autopsy was performed postmoterm and thoracic and abdominal aortic dissection along the root of ascending aorta was present and massive hematoma within right and left thorax was present.Acute aortic disease can be difficult to recognize; therefore, diagnosis is sometimes delayed or missed. It is important to recognize the atypical symptoms of aortic dissection and maintain a broad differential diagnosis if patients complained of abdominal pain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29235243>A waiting time of 7 min is sufficient to reduce bleeding in oculoplastic surgery following the administration of epinephrine together with local anaesthesia.</a></h1><p>The time taken to reach maximal haemostatic effect following local anaesthesia with epinephrine is generally believed to be <10 min. This is based on clinical experience and indirect measurements of perfusion using methods such as laser Doppler flowmetry and  spectroscopy. However, the only study in which bleeding has been measured quantitatively in an intra-operative setting in humans showed that the full haemostatic effect was not achieved until 30 min after anaesthesia. The aim of this study was to determine the time taken to reach maximum haemostatic effect when using epinephrine for local anaesthesia in oculoplastic surgery.Intra-operative bleeding following infiltration anaesthesia with either lidocaine 20 mg/ml (2%) or lidocaine + epinephrine 12.5 μg/ml (1:80 000) was measured after 7, 15 and 30 min in the eyelids of 16 patients undergoing upper eyelid blepharoplasty.Bleeding was decreased by 74.6% (with 95% CI, 6.16-87.6%) 7 min after the injection of lidocaine + epinephrine (p = 0.0048) compared with lidocaine without epinephrine. There was no further decrease in bleeding after 15 or 30 min (p = n.s.).The optimal time for skin incision in eyelid surgery is within 7 min of injection of lidocaine with epinephrine. Waiting longer does not lead to a further decrease in bleeding.© 2017 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

This double-blinded randomized control trial investigated whether inhaled salbutamol premedication decreased the occurrence of PRAE in children identified as being at high risk of PRAE.Children with at least two parentally reported risk factors for PRAE undergoing elective surgery were eligible for recruitment. They were randomized to receive either salbutamol (200 µg) or placebo prior to their surgery and PRAE (bronchospasm, laryngospasm, airway obstruction, desaturation, coughing and stridor) were recorded.Out of 470 children (6-16 yr, 277 males, 59%) recruited, 462 were available for an intention-to-treat analysis. Thirty-two (14%) and 27 (12%) children from the placebo and salbutamol groups experienced PRAE. This difference was not significant [odds ratio (OR): 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48-1.44, P : 0.51].  desaturation [14/232 (6%) vs 14/230 (6%), OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.47-2.17, P : 0.98] and severe coughing [12/232 (5%) vs 10/230 (4%), OR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.35-1.97, P : 0.68] were the most common PRAE, but did not significantly differ between the groups. The occurrence of PRAE was slightly lower in children with respiratory symptoms who received salbutamol compared with placebo [16/134 (12%) vs 21/142 (15%), OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.38-2.26, P : 0.87], but was not significantly different.Premedication with salbutamol to children aged between 6 and 16 years and at high risk of PRAE prior to their surgery did not reduce their risk of PRAE.ACTRN12612000626864 ( www.anzctr.org.au ).© The Author 2017.

Risk factors for postoperative serious adverse events (pSAEs) in patients living in high altitudes during primary hip arthroplasty (HA) are not clear.This is an observational study embracing patients from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2015 at Yan'an Hospital of Kunming City, a 1338-bed municipal teaching hospital of Kunming Medical University. Univariate analysis revealed that significant differences between patients with and without preoperative CH occurred in intraoperative hypotension (77 [33%] vs 34 [47%], P = .040) and that significant differences between patients with and without pSAEs occurred in following variables: preoperative CH (32 [57%] vs 199 [80%], P < .001), intraoperative hypotension (37 [66%] vs 74 [30%], P < .001), highest noradrenaline support (.09 [.01-.21] vs .03 [.01-.05] μg/kg/min, P < .001), higher application of general anesthesia (15 [27%] vs 29 [12%], P = .004), and lower of combined-spinal epidural anesthesia (CSEA) (21 [37%] vs 165 [66%], P < .001). The general anesthesia and intraoperative hypotension remained the independent risk factors for pSAEs (P < .05), while the preoperative CH presented by decreasing its risk (P < .05).This study suggests that various intraoperative events including general anesthesia, hypotension were risk factors for the development of pSAEs. Preoperative CH, presenting with decreased incidence of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and pSAEs, may mimic hypoxic preconditioning in organic protection, for which further study is needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29219187>Integrated molecular, biochemical, and physiological assessment unravels key extraction method mediated influences on rat neonatal cardiomyocytes.</a></h1><p>Neonatal cardiomyocytes are instrumental for disease modeling, but the effects of different cell extraction methods on basic cell biological processes remain poorly understood. We assessed the influence of two popular methods to extract rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, Pre-plating (PP), and Percoll (PC) on cell structure, metabolism, and function. Cardiomyocytes obtained from PP showed higher gene expression for troponins, titin, and potassium and sodium channels compared to PC. Also, PP cells displayed higher levels of troponin I protein. Cells obtained from PC displayed higher lactate dehydrogenase activity and lactate production than PP cells, indicating higher anaerobic metabolism after 8 days of culture. In contrast, reactive  species levels were higher in PP cells as indicated by ethidium and hydroxyethidium production. Consistent with these data, protein nitration was higher in PP cells, as well as nitrite accumulation in cell medium. Moreover, PP cells showed higher global intracellular calcium under basal and 1 mM isoprenaline conditions. In a calcium-transient assessment under electrical stimulation (0.5 Hz), PP cells displayed higher calcium amplitude than cardiomyocytes obtained from PC and using a traction force microscope technique we observed that PP cardiomyocytes showed the highest relaxation. Collectively, we demonstrated that extraction methods influence parameters related to cell structure, metabolism, and function. Overall, PP derived cells are more active and mature than PC cells, displaying higher contractile function and generating more reactive  species. On the other hand, PC derived cells display higher anaerobic metabolism, despite comparable high yields from both protocols.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28586070>Protective effect of diethylcarbamazine inhibits NF-κB activation in isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial infarction rat model through the PARP pathway.</a></h1><p>The present study investigated the protective effect of diethylcarbamazine in inhibiting nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation in isoproterenol‑induced acute myocardial infarction (AMI) rats through the poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) pathway. Male albino Wistar rats were injected subcutaneously with isoproterenol (100 mg/kg/day) for 2 days to induce an AMI model. Diethylcarbamazine (50 mg/kg) was administered by gavage for 12 days prior to the isoproterenol-induced AMI. It was noted that diethylcarbamazine significantly inhibited AMI‑induced casein kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, and reduced the AMI‑induced wet heart weight to body weight ratio in AMI rats. Diethylcarbamazine treatment significantly weakened reactive  species production and reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α, interleukin‑6 and NF‑κB/p65 in AMI rats. Western blotting demonstrated that diethylcarbamazine significantly suppressed the AMI‑induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β1, cyclooxygenase‑2 (COX‑2) and PARP protein expression in AMI rats. The results demonstrated that the protective effect of diethylcarbamazine inhibited isoproterenol‑induced AMI through the suppression of inflammation, iNOS, TGF‑β1, COX‑2 and the PARP pathway, and revealed the clinical potential of diethylcarbamazine for therapeutic and clinical applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29775243>Protective and therapeutic effects of dexpanthenol on isoproterenol-induced cardiac damage in rats.</a></h1><p>The purpose of the study was to explore the protective and therapeutic effects of dexpanthenol (DEX) on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac damage. Forty rats were distributed into four groups: group I (Control); group II (ISO); ISO (150 mg/kg/day) was given to rats once a day for 2 consecutive days with an interval of 24 h; group III (DEX+ISO): DEX (250 mg/kg) was applied 30 min before the first ISO administration and continued in the next two days after second ISO administration; group IV (ISO+DEX): After the ISO treatment at 1st and 2nd days, DEX was given at 3rd and 4th days. Rats were monitored for mean arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate,  saturation (%SO ), and electrocardiography (ECG). Heart tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), reduced glutathione (GSH), total oxidant status (TOS); total antioxidant capacity (TAC), oxidative stress index (OSI), and caspase-3 were determined. BP and SO values indicated a significant decrease in the ISO group. Also, T wave negativity was observed in 6 of 10 rats, SOD, CAT, and GPX levels were significantly lower in ISO group than control group. ISO administration increased TOS and OSI levels, whereas DEX treatment significantly reduced these parameters. Also, ISO-induced morphological alterations such as disorganization of cardiomyocytes, loss of myofibrils and cytoplasmic vacuolization whereas these histological damages were significantly decreased in ISO+DEX and DEX+ISO groups when compared to the ISO group. This study implies the cardioprotective effects of DEX on ISO-induced cardiotoxicity.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28459438>Pericytes impair capillary blood flow and motor function after chronic spinal cord injury.</a></h1><p>Blood vessels in the central nervous system (CNS) are controlled by neuronal activity. For example, widespread vessel constriction (vessel tone) is induced by brainstem neurons that release the monoamines serotonin and noradrenaline, and local vessel dilation is induced by glutamatergic neuron activity. Here we examined how vessel tone adapts to the loss of neuron-derived monoamines after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. We find that, months after the imposition of SCI, the spinal cord below the site of injury is in a chronic state of hypoxia owing to paradoxical excess activity of monoamine receptors (5-HT) on pericytes, despite the absence of monoamines. This monoamine-receptor activity causes pericytes to locally constrict capillaries, which reduces blood flow to ischemic levels. Receptor activation in the absence of monoamines results from the production of trace amines (such as tryptamine) by pericytes that ectopically express the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), which synthesizes trace amines directly from dietary amino acids (such as tryptophan). Inhibition of monoamine receptors or of AADC, or even an increase in inhaled , produces substantial relief from hypoxia and improves motoneuron and locomotor function after SCI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28521971>Comparison of early sequential hypothermia and delayed hypothermia on neurological function after resuscitation in a swine model.</a></h1><p>We utilized a porcine cardiac arrest model to compare early sequential hypothermia (ESH) with delayed hypothermia (DH) and no hypothermia (NH) to investigate the different effects on cerebral function after resuscitation.After return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), resuscitated 24 pigs divided into three groups. The ESH group implemented early sequential hypothermia immediately, and the DH group implemented delayed hypothermia at 1 h after ROSC. The core temperature, hemodynamic parameters and  metabolism were recorded. Cerebral metabolism variables and neurotransmitter in the extracellular fluid were collected through the microdialysis tubes. The bloods were analyzed for venous jugular bulb  saturation, lactate and neuron specific nolase. The cerebral function was evaluated using the cerebral performance category and neurologic deficit score at 72h after ROSC and cerebral histology in the right posterior frontal lobe were collected.ESH reached the target temperature earlier and showed more favorable outcomes of neurological function than DH. Specifically, early sequential hypothermia reduced cerebral  and energy consumption and decreased extracellular accumulation of neurotransmitters after resuscitation and protected the integrity of the BBB during reperfusion.Early sequential hypothermia could increase the protection of neurological function after resuscitation and produce better neurological outcomes.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) reportedly has an antioxidant effect. However, protective roles and related potential molecular mechanisms of DEX against kidney injury induced by acute stress are unknown. Herein, rats were forced to swim 15 min followed by restraint stress for 3 h with/without DEX (30 g/kg). Successful model establishment was validated by an open-field test. Assessment of renal function (creatinine, urea nitrogen), histopathology, oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase), and apoptosis (transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) was performed. Localization of apoptosis was determined by immunohistochemistry of cleaved caspase 3 protein. In addition, key proteins of the death receptor-mediated pathway, mitochondrial pathway, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) pathway, and ROS/JNK signaling pathway were measured by Western blot. We found that DEX significantly improved renal dysfunction, ameliorated kidney injury, reduced oxidative stress, and alleviated apoptosis. DEX also inhibited the release of norepinephrine (NE), decreased the production of reactive  species (ROS), and inhibited JNK phosphorylation. Additionally, DEX downregulated the expression of Bax, cytochrome C, cleaved caspase 9, and cleaved caspase 3 proteins in mitochondria-dependent pathways. In summary, DEX protects against acute stress-induced kidney injury in rats by reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis via inhibition of the ROS/JNK pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29070564>No metabolic effects of mustard allyl-isothiocyanate compared with placebo in men.</a></h1><p> Induction of nonshivering thermogenesis can be used to influence energy balance to prevent or even treat obesity. The pungent component of mustard, allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC), activates the extreme cold receptor transient receptor potential channel, subfamily A, member 1 and may thus induce energy expenditure and metabolic changes. The objective of our study was to evaluate the potential of mustard AITC to induce thermogenesis (primary outcome) and alter body temperature, cold and hunger sensations, plasma metabolic parameters, and energy intake (secondary outcomes). Energy expenditure in mice was measured after subcutaneous injection with vehicle, 1 mg norepinephrine/kg, or 5 mg AITC/kg. In our human crossover study, 11 healthy subjects were studied under temperature-controlled conditions after an overnight fast. After ingestion of 10 g of capsulated mustard or uncapsulated mustard or a capsulated placebo mixture, measurements of energy expenditure, substrate oxidation, core temperature, cold and hunger scores, and plasma parameters were repeated every 30 min during a 150-min period. Subjects were randomly selected for the placebo and capsulated mustard intervention; 9 of 11 subjects received the uncapsulated mustard as the final intervention because this could not be blinded. After the experiments, energy intake was measured with the universal eating monitor in a test meal. In mice, AITC administration induced a 32% increase in energy expenditure compared with vehicle (17.5 ± 4.9 J · min · mouse compared with 12.5 ± 1.2 J · min · mouse,  = 0.03). Of the 11 randomly selected participants, 1 was excluded because of intercurrent illness after the first visit and 1 withdrew after the second visit. Energy expenditure did not increase after ingestion of capsulated or uncapsulated mustard compared with placebo. No differences in substrate oxidation, core temperature, cold and hunger scores, or plasma parameters were found, nor was the energy intake at the end of the experiment different between the 3 conditions. The highest tolerable dose of mustard we were able to use did not elicit a relevant thermogenic response in humans.

We hypothesized that heliox would have a significant effect on aerosol delivery as compared with  with both quiet and distressed breathing patterns.A vibrating mesh nebulizer was placed at the inlet of a humidifier via HFNC with small adult cannula distal to the heated-wire circuit with prongs placed into simulated nares with a T-shaped trap and absolute filter connected to a breath simulator set to adult quiet and distressed breathing parameters. Albuterol sulfate (0.083% 2.5 mg/3 mL) was aerosolized with heliox (80:20) and  (100%) at 10, 30, and 50 L/min. Drug eluted from the filter was assayed with UV spectrophotometry (276 nm). Descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used for data analysis.  < .05 was considered statistically significant.Increasing flows with heliox and  significantly decreased percentage inhaled dose (inhaled dose) of aerosol with a quiet breathing pattern ( = .02 and  = .030, respectively). In contrast, with a distressed breathing pattern, inhaled dose at 10 L/min was lower than at 30 and 50 L/min ( = .009 and  = .01, respectively) with both  and heliox ( = .009 and  = .009, respectively). Despite a trend to higher aerosol deposition with heliox versus , the differences were not significant.With a distressed breathing pattern, aerosol delivery was greater at 30 and 50 L/min than with a quiet breathing pattern. Trends toward higher inhaled dose with heliox during HFNC were not significant.Copyright © 2017 by Daedalus Enterprises.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30199058>[Possibilities of thermographic rating the level of microcirculation with local anesthesia in dentistry].</a></h1><p>It is known that the reduction of blood vessels by epinephrine that are part of the local anesthetic leads to a decrease in  intake and the development of hypoxia, which has a significant effect on the excitability of nerve fibers. This is due to the fact that epinephrine is present in the local anesthetic cartridge, which helps to reduce, until termination, microcirculation in the depot area, which leads to local hypothermia. With the introduction of local anesthetics, the temperature of which is significantly lower than the depot temperature, the patient experiences severe discomfort, which is associated with unsuccessful local anesthesia. The goal of the study was the need to analyze the feasibility of using the thermography method in assessing the degree of ischemia of the soft tissues of the maxillofacial region against the background of local anesthesia with a different concentration of epinephrine in dentistry.In the pilot study, 22 healthy volunteers aged between 29-35 years of both sexes participated. To assess the degree of external vasoconstriction, a buccal region was chosen near the maxilla. Infiltration anesthesia was used with a 4% solution of articaine with epinephrine 1: 100 000 and 1: 200 000 at a dosage of 0.5-0.7 ml. The temperature distribution in the study area was estimated using a thermal imager Nec InfReC Thermo Gear G30.The study showed that the use of epinephrine in local anesthetics naturally has a moderate effect on hemodynamics in areas adjacent to the anesthesia depot. When using a low concentration of epinephrine (1:200 000), the projection hyperthermia of the skin is determined. Perhaps this is due to the activation of microcirculation due to an increase in capillary blood flow in the region above the zone of action of the epinephrine. From the point of view of physiological arterial hyperemia, this mechanism carries positive properties, since leads to an increase in tissue oxygenation. When using a high concentration of epinephrine (1:100 000), the zone of hypothermia of the skin is determined, which corresponds to the phenomenon of angiospastic ischemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28366530>Synthesis of camphecene derivatives using click chemistry methodology and study of their antiviral activity.</a></h1><p>A series of seventeen tetrazole derivatives of 1,7,7-trimethyl-[2.2.1]bicycloheptane were synthesized using click chemistry methodology and characterized by spectral data.

The 2K1C hypertensive rats were divided into untreated, nebivolol (10mg/kg, ig), and atenolol (80mg/kg, ig) treatment groups. The treatments lasted for 8 weeks. SBP, kidney structure and function, plasma and kidney angiotensin (Ang) II, nitric oxide (NO), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and the oxidant status were examined. Kidney protein expression of NADPH oxidase (Nox) isoforms and its subunit p22, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms, protein arginine N-methyltransferase (PRMT) 1, and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) 1 and 2 was tested by western blotting.Nebivolol and atenolol exerted similar hypotensive effects. However, atenolol had little effect while nebivolol significantly ameliorated the functional decline and structural damage in the kidney, especially in non-clipped kidney (NCK), which was associated with the reduction of Ang II in NCK. Moreover, nebivolol inhibited the NCK production of reactive  species (ROS) by decreasing Nox2, Nox4, and p22 expression. Further, nebivolol reduced the plasma and kidney ADMA levels by increasing DDAH2 expression and decreasing PRMT1 expression. Nebivolol also increased the NCK NO level by ameliorating the expression of kidney NOS isoforms.Our results demonstrated that long-term treatment with nebivolol had renoprotective effect in 2K1C rats partly via regulation of kidney ROS-ADMA-NO pathway.Copyright © 2018 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

What determines whether a sensory stimulus will be perceived? While different behavioral and cognitive states may share a similar profile of electrophysiology, metabolism, and early sensory responses, neuromodulation is often different and therefore may constitute a key mechanism enabling perceptual awareness. Specifically, noradrenaline improves sensory responses, correlates with orienting toward behaviorally relevant stimuli, and is markedly reduced during sleep, while experience is largely "disconnected" from external events. Despite correlative evidence hinting at a relationship between noradrenaline and perception, causal evidence remains absent. Here, we pharmacologically down- and upregulated noradrenaline signaling in healthy volunteers using clonidine and reboxetine in double-blind placebo-controlled experiments, testing the effects on perceptual abilities and visually evoked electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI responses. We found that detection sensitivity, discrimination accuracy, and subjective visibility change in accordance with noradrenaline (NE) levels, whereas decision bias (criterion) is not affected. Similarly, noradrenaline increases the consistency of EEG visually evoked potentials, while lower noradrenaline levels delay response components around 200 ms. Furthermore, blood--level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI activations in high-order visual cortex selectively vary along with noradrenaline signaling. Taken together, these results point to noradrenaline as a key factor causally linking visual awareness to external world events. VIDEO ABSTRACT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The inhalation of allergens and pollutants promotes the production of reactive  species (ROS) leading to airway inflammation, hyper-responsiveness, and remodeling in allergic asthma. The effects of asthma medications on ROS production are unclear. The present study investigated the anti-ROS effects of current asthma medications including inhaled corticosteroid (ICS; budesonide and fluticasone), leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA; montelukast), long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs; salmeterol and formoterol), and a new extra-LABA (indacaterol).The human monocyte cell line THP-1 cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of the asthma medications at different time points after hydrogen peroxide (HO) stimulation. HO production was measured with DCFH-DA by flow cytometry.Montelukast, fluticasone, and salmeterol suppressed HO-induced ROS production. Indacaterol enhanced HO-induced ROS production. Budesonide and formoterol alone had no anti-ROS effects, but the combination of these two drugs significantly suppressed HO-induced ROS production.Different asthma medications have different anti-ROS effects on monocytes. The combination therapy with LABA and ICS seemed not to be the only choice for asthma control. Montelukast may also be a good supplemental treatment for the poorly controlled asthma because of its powerful anti-ROS effects. Our findings provide a novel therapeutic view in asthma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30450858>Single Ventilation during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Results in Better Neurological Outcomes in a Porcine Model of Cardiac Arrest.</a></h1><p>Recent basic life support (BLS) guidelines recommend a 30:2 compression-to-ventilation ratio (CV2) or chest compression-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CC); however, there are inevitable risks of interruption of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in CV2 and hypoxemia in CC. In this study, we compared the short-term outcomes among CC, CV2, and 30:1 CV ratio (CV1).In total, 42 pigs were randomly assigned to CC, CV1, or CV2 groups. After induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF), we observed pigs for 2 minutes without any intervention. Thereafter, BLS was started according to the assigned method and performed for 8 minutes. Defibrillation was performed after BLS and repeated every 2 minutes, followed by rhythm analysis. Advanced cardiac life support, including continuous chest compression with ventilation every 6 seconds and intravenous injection of 1 mg epinephrine every 4 minutes, was performed until the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or 22 minutes after VF induction. Hemodynamic parameters and arterial blood gas profiles were compared among groups. ROSC, 24-hour survival, and neurologic outcomes were evaluated at 24 hours.The hemodynamic parameters during CPR did not differ among the study groups. Partial pressure of  in arterial blood and arterial  saturation were lowest in the CC group, compared to those in the other groups, during the BLS period (=0.002 and <0.001, respectively). The CV1 groups showed a significantly higher rate of favorable neurologic outcome (swine CPC 1 or 2) than the other groups (=0.044).CPR with CV1 could promote better neurologic outcome than CV2 and CC.© Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2018.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30200571>Dietary Fructose Increases the Sensitivity of Proximal Tubules to Angiotensin II in Rats Fed High-Salt Diets.</a></h1><p>Dietary fructose causes salt-sensitive hypertension. Proximal tubules (PTs) reabsorb 70% of the filtered NaCl. Angiotensin II (Ang II), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and norepinephrine (NE) regulate this process. Although Ang II signaling blockade ameliorates fructose-induced salt-sensitive hypertension, basal PT Na⁺ reabsorption and its sensitivity to the aforementioned factors have not been studied in this model. We hypothesized consuming fructose with a high-salt diet selectively enhances the sensitivity of PT transport to Ang II. We investigated the effects of Ang II, ANP and NE on PT Na reabsorption in rats fed a high-salt diet drinking tap water (HS) or 20% fructose (HS-FRU).  consumption (QO₂) was used as a measure of all ATP-dependent transport processes. Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase and Na⁺/H⁺-exchange (NHE) activities were studied because they represent primary apical and basolateral transporters in this segment. The effect of 10 mol/L Ang II in QO₂ by PTs from HS-FRU was larger than HS ( < 0.02;  = 7). In PTs from HS-FRU 10 mol/L Ang II stimulated NHE activity by 2.6 ± 0.7 arbitrary fluorescence units/s ( < 0.01;  = 5) but not in those from HS. The stimulatory effect of Ang II on PT Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity was not affected by HS-FRU. Responses of QO₂ and NHE activity to ANP did not differ between groups. The response of QO₂ to NE was unaltered by HS-FRU. We concluded that the sensitivity of PT Na⁺ reabsorption specifically to Ang II is enhanced by HS-FRU. This maintains high rates of transport even in the presence of low concentrations of the peptide, and likely contributes to the hypertension.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28410968>Increase in serum noradrenaline concentration by short dives with bradycardia in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin Tursiops aduncus.</a></h1><p>In cetaceans, diving behavior immediately induces a change in blood circulation to favor flow to the brain and heart; this is achieved by intense vasoconstriction of the blood vessels that serve other organs. This blood circulation response is allied to a decrease in heart rate in order to optimize  usage during diving. Vasoconstrictors are present in all mammals and stimulate the contraction of the smooth muscle in the walls of blood vessels. The most important of these vasoconstrictors are the hormones adrenaline (A), noradrenaline (NA), and angiotensin II (ANG II). At present, the contribution of these hormones to vasoconstriction during diving in cetaceans is unclear. To elucidate their possible roles, changes in serum levels of A, NA and ANG II were monitored together with heart rate in the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin Tursiops aduncus during 90 and 180s dives. Both brief diving periods induced an increase in serum NA concentration and a decrease in heart rate; however, no changes were detected in serum levels of A or ANG II. These data indicate that NA may play a role in diving-induced vasoconstriction.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the protective and antilipid oxidative effects of individual plasmalogen species against Pb damage have received little attention. In this study, six plasmalogen species (with either choline or  as the headgroup and p16:0/18:1, p16:0/18:2, or p16:0/20:5 as the side chains) were evaluated in human hepatoma cells. Plasmalogen species showed a remarkable recovery in cell viability as well as elimination of reactive  species and suppressed the accumulation of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides (from 63.6 ± 1.8% to 80.3 ± 2.9%) and phosphatidylethanolamine hydroperoxides (from 25.7 ± 9.3% to 76.1 ± 3.7%). Moreover, plasmalogens significantly upregulated the gene expression levels of a series of antioxidant enzymes that are regulated via the Nrf-2-dependent pathway. This study suggested that choline and  plasmalogens could prevent Pb-induced cytotoxicity and lipid oxidation in HepG2 cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28572492>Beta-1 vs. beta-2 adrenergic control of coronary blood flow during isometric handgrip exercise in humans.</a></h1><p>During exercise, β-adrenergic receptors are activated throughout the body. In healthy humans, the net effect of β-adrenergic stimulation is an increase in coronary blood flow. However, the role of vascular β1 vs. β2 receptors in coronary exercise hyperemia is not clear. In this study, we simultaneously measured noninvasive indexes of myocardial  supply (i.e., blood velocity in the left anterior descending coronary artery; Doppler echocardiography) and demand [i.e., rate pressure product (RPP) = heart rate × systolic blood pressure) and tested the hypothesis that β1 blockade with esmolol improves coronary exercise hyperemia compared with nonselective β-blockade with propranolol. Eight healthy young men received intravenous infusions of esmolol, propranolol, and saline on three separate days in a single-blind, randomized, crossover design. During each infusion, subjects performed isometric handgrip exercise until fatigue. Blood pressure, heart rate, and coronary blood velocity (CBV) were measured continuously, and RPP was calculated. Changes in parameters from baseline were compared with paired -tests. Esmolol (Δ = 3296 ± 1204) and propranolol (Δ = 2997 ± 699) caused similar reductions in peak RPP compared with saline (Δ = 5384 ± 1865). In support of our hypothesis, ΔCBV with esmolol was significantly greater than with propranolol (7.3 ± 2.4 vs. 4.5 ± 1.6 cm/s;  = 0.002). This effect was also evident when normalizing ΔCBV to ΔRPP. In summary, not only does selective β1 blockade reduce myocardial  demand during exercise, but it also unveils β2-receptor-mediated coronary exercise hyperemia. In this study, we evaluated the role of vascular β1 vs. β2 receptors in coronary exercise hyperemia in a single-blind, randomized, crossover study in healthy men. In response to isometric handgrip exercise, blood flow velocity in the left anterior descending coronary artery was significantly greater with esmolol compared with propranolol. These findings increase our understanding of the individual and combined roles of coronary β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors in humans.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28796814>Hyperoxia does not directly affect vascular tone in isolated arteries from mice.</a></h1><p>Hospitalized patients often receive  supplementation, which can lead to a supraphysiological  tension (hyperoxia). Hyperoxia can have hemodynamic effects, including an increase in systemic vascular resistance. This increase suggests hyperoxia-induced vasoconstriction, yet reported direct effects of hyperoxia on vessel tone have been inconsistent. Furthermore, hyperoxia-induced changes in vessel diameter have not been studied in mice, currently the most used mammal model of disease. In this study we set out to develop a pressure-myograph model using isolated vessels from mice for investigation of pathways involved in hyperoxic vasoconstriction. Isolated conduit and resistance arteries (femoral artery and gracilis arteriole, respectively) from C57BL/6 mice were exposed to normoxia (PO2 of 80 mmHg) and three levels of hyperoxia (PO2 of 215, 375 and 665 mmHg) in a no-flow pressure myograph setup. Under the different PO2 levels, dose-response agonist induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation (acetylcholine, arachidonic acid), endothelium-independent vasodilation (s-nitroprusside), as well as vasoconstriction (norepinephrine, prostaglandin F2α) were examined. The investigated arteries did not respond to  by a change in vascular tone. In the dose-response studies, maximal responses and EC50 values to any of the aforementioned agonists were not affected by hyperoxia either. We conclude that arteries and arterioles from healthy mice are not intrinsically sensitive to hyperoxic conditions. The present ex-vivo model is therefore not suitable for further research into mechanisms of hyperoxic vasoconstriction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30857600>Effects of vasopressin during a pulmonary hypertensive crisis induced by acute hypoxia in a rat model of pulmonary hypertension.</a></h1><p>A pulmonary hypertensive crisis (PHC) can be a life-threatening condition. We established a PHC model by exposing rats with monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension to acute hypoxia, and investigated the effects of vasopressin, phenylephrine, and norepinephrine on the PHC.Four weeks after MCT 60 mg kg administration i.v., right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), systolic BP (SBP), mean BP (MBP), cardiac index (CI), and pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) were measured. PHC defined as an RVSP exceeding or equal to SBP was induced by changing the fraction of inspiratory  to 0.1. Rats were subsequently treated by vasopressin, phenylephrine, or norepinephrine, followed by assessment of systemic haemodynamics, isometric tension of femoral and pulmonary arteries, cardiac function, blood gas composition, and survival.PHC was associated with increased RV dilatation and paradoxical septal motion. Vasopressin increased MBP [mean (standard error)] from 52.6 (3.8) to 125.0 (8.9) mm Hg and CI from 25.4 (2.3) to 40.6 (1.8) ml min 100 g while decreasing PVRI. Vasopressin also improved RV dilatation, oxygenation, and survival in PHC. In contrast, phenylephrine increased MBP from 54.8 (2.3) to 96.8 (3.2) mm Hg without improving cardiac pump function. Norepinephrine did not alter MBP. Vasopressin contracted femoral but not pulmonary arteries, whereas phenylephrine contracted both arterial beds. Hence, improvements with vasopressin in PHC might be associated with decreased PVRI and selective systemic vasoconstriction.In this rat model of a PHC, vasopressin, but not phenylephrine or norepinephrine, resulted in better haemodynamic and vascular recovery.Copyright © 2019 British Journal of Anaesthesia.

We investigated the anti-nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) effect of AA and its underlying mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. C57BL/6 mice were fed a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 4 weeks to induce NASH. The mice were simultaneously treated with a daily dose of AA (15, 30, and 60 mg kg, ig) for 4 weeks. On the last day, the animals were sacrificed and plasma and liver tissue were collected. Serum and liver tissue biochemical analyses and histological observation were performed. The human hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 was used to build NASH models by culturing with conditioned medium from WRL-68 liver cells after exposure to MCD medium in vitro. Liver oxidative stress and inflammatory indices and autophagy markers were examined. The results showed that AA suppressed reactive  species (ROS) and inflammation in a NASH mouse model and inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines and ROS in LX-2 cells in MCD medium. Furthermore, we found AA stimulated autophagy in mice liver and LX-2, which could be the underlying mechanism of AA in NASH. To further investigate the role of autophagy in LX-2 cells, we found that AA regulated autophagy via the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathway and dorsomorphin, a selective AMPK inhibitor, led to the suppression of AA-induced autophagy. Taken together, our results indicate that AA could be a possible therapy for NASH by inhibiting oxidative stress and stimulating autophagy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Long-term clinical studies have been performed using tetracyclines, without significant side effects. Previous studies demonstrated that doxycycline (DOX), a major tetracyclin antibiotic, exerted a protective effect in animal models of heart failure; however, its exact molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here, we provide the first evidence that DOX reduces oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and depolarization in H9c2 cardiomyocytes and beneficially alters the expression of Mfn-2, OPA-1 and Drp-1 -the main regulators of mitochondrial fusion and fission-in our isoproterenol (ISO)-induced heart failure model, ultimately decreasing the severity of heart failure. In mitochondria, oxidative stress causes a shift toward fission which leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death. Protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress, and the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by drugs that shift the balance toward fusion, could be a novel therapeutic approach for heart failure. On the basis of our findings, we raise the possibility that DOX could be a novel therapeutic agent in the future treatment of heart failure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30204110>CONTENT OF CATECHOLAMINES IN BLOOD SERUM OF RATS UNDER FLUORIDE INTOXICATION.</a></h1><p>The aim of the research was to determine in the experiment the content of catecholamines in serum of rats exposed to sodium fluoride. The studies were conducted on adult Wistar rats, subjected to oral exposure by means of a probe with aqueous solutions of sodium fluoride (SF) once daily, for 60 days at doses of 1/10, 1/100 and 1/1000 DL50, which correspondingly amounts to 20 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg of body weight. Toxification of rats at a dose of 1/100 DL50 for 60 days and at a dose of 1/10 DL50 for 50 days was accompanied by an increase in blood levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine, indicating the hyperactivation of the mediator and hormonal parts of the sympathoadrenal system, and tension of the protective and adaptive reactions of the organism. Prolonged hypercatecholemia may become a pathogenic factor due to intensification of the quinidine route of oxidation of norepinephrine and epinephrine with the formation of reactive radicals and active forms of . Reduced serum content of catecholamines on the 60th day of oral administration at a dose of 1/10 DL50 reflects, on the one hand, a decrease in their tissue deposit, and, on the other, a decrease in the activity and reserve capacities of the sympathoadrenal system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29686052>Synthesis of Human Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Contributes to Angiopoietin-Mediated In Vitro Proinflammatory and Proangiogenic Activities.</a></h1><p>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are composed of nuclear DNA in a web-like structure extruded from neutrophils in response to either bacterial infection or inflammation. We previously reported the expression of angiopoietin Tie2 receptor on human neutrophils and the capacity of both angiopoietins (Ang1 and Ang2) to induce proinflammatory activities, such as synthesis and release of platelet-activating factor, upregulation of β integrin complex (CD11/CD18), and neutrophil chemotaxis. In contrast, only Ang1 but not Ang2 is capable of promoting translational and transcriptional activities in neutrophils. In this article, we addressed whether Ang1 and/or Ang2 could modulate the release of NETs and if they contribute to angiopoietin-mediated proinflammatory activities. We observed that Ang1 and Ang2, alone or combined (10 nM, 3 h), increase NET synthesis and release by ≈2.5-fold as compared with PBS-treated neutrophils. The release of NETs is Tie2 dependent and requires downstream intracellular participation of PI3K, p38, and p42/44 MAPK pathways; reactive  species production; intracellular calcium store depletion; and protein arginine deiminase 4 activation. These isolated NETs induced neutrophil and endothelial cell activation, leading to neutrophil adhesion onto human extracellular matrix and HUVEC and in vitro formation of capillary-like tubes by endothelial cells. Our study reports the capacity of Ang1 and Ang2 to promote the release of NETs and that these NETs contribute to angiopoietin-mediated in vitro proinflammatory and proangiogenic activities.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899385>Niclosamide  protects kidney in adriamycin nephropathy by regulating mitochondrial redox balance.</a></h1><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is commonly characterized by proteinuria and leads to progressive glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Accumulating evidence implicates mitochondrial dysfunction including reactive  species (ROS) overproduction in the pathogenesis of CKD. Mitochondrial function and ROS production are regulated by mitochondrial uncoupling. Niclosamide  salt (NEN) is a mild mitochondrial uncoupler, which reduces urinary albumin excretion in mice with diabetic kidney disease. However, its role in nondiabetic kidney disease has not been investigated. Here we show that NEN exerts renoprotective effects in adriamycin induced nondiabetic kidney disease. It reduces urinary protein excretion, restores podocyte function, ameliorates renal pathological injury, and decreases the excretion of the urinary tubular injury biomarkers NGAL and Kim-1. Specifically, NEN uncouples isolated kidney mitochondria, and dose-dependently decreases the renal production and urinary excretion of HO. Moreover, NEN increases catalase and PGC-1α expression, which might accelerate HO scavenging. The results of this study provide the first evidence that NEN protects kidney in nondiabetic kidney disease by regulating redox balance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015039>Contrasting photoreactivity of β2-adrenoceptor agonists Salbutamol and Terbutaline in the presence of humic substances.</a></h1><p>The photodegradation reactions of two typical β2-adrenoceptor agonists, salbutamol (SAL) and terbutaline (TBL), alone, and in the presence of Aldrich humic acid (AHA) or Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) were investigated by steady-state photolysis experiments, laser flash photolysis (LFP), kinetic modeling and quantum calculation. AHA and SRFA (2-20 mgC L) accelerated the phototransformation of both SAL and TBL. For SAL, an inhibiting effect of  on the photodegradation was observed that is fully consistent with the main involvement of excited triplet states of HS (HS*). On the contrary,  drastically enhanced the photodegradation of TBL showing that HS* were negligibly involved in the reaction. The involvement of singlet  was also ruled out because of the low reaction rate constant measured between TBL and singlet . Quantum calculations were therefore performed to explore whether oxygenated radicals could through addition reactions explain the differences of reactivity of TBL and SAL in  medium. Interestingly, calculations showed that in the presence of , the addition of phenoxyl on TBL led to the formation of adducts and to the loss of TBL while the same addition reaction on SAL partly regenerated the starting compound and at the end degraded SAL less efficiently. This study is of high relevance to understand the processes involved in SAL and TBL phototransformation and the photoreactivity of HS. Moreover, our findings suggest that TBL might be a promising probe molecule to delineate the role of oxygenated radicals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The association of this microbial metabolite and its downstream products with diseases such as atherosclerosis and chronic kidney disease has driven the need for a better molecular understanding of TMA-generating enzymes.

In addition, we present the methods we have developed to characterize the activity of CutD and utilize this enzyme in conjunction with purified CutC to gain an unprecedented insight into the anaerobic C-N cleavage of choline.© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The case is followed by a brief review of the JHR which is rarely observed with treatment of leptospirosis. A healthy 28-year-old female who recently returned from the Caribbean presented to the emergency department with flu-like symptoms. The patient appeared jaundiced with conjunctival suffusion and was ultimately treated with the appropriate antibiotics for leptospirosis in the ED. She decompensated subsequently, requiring supplemental , central and arterial line placement, and vasopressor support with norepinephrine. Although rarely encountered and not well reported throughout the literature, initiation of antibiotics can cause a JHR reaction given that Leptospira interrogans is a spirochete. This JHR may be self-limited and of short duration, or it can be prolonged and severe, requiring invasive therapies such as central line placement for vasopressor support and intubation. It is suggested that patients started on antibiotics for leptospirosis/Weil's disease should be monitored in the emergency department for a short duration prior to discharge or transfer to a regular medical floor for observation given the possibility for decompensation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We sought to determine whether human skeletal muscle feed arteries (SFMAs) express TRPV channels and what role they play in modulating vascular function. What is the main finding and its importance? Human SMFAs do express functional TRPV channels that modulate vascular function, specifically opposing α-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasocontraction and potentiating vasorelaxation, in an endothelium-dependent manner, as evidenced by the α -receptor-mediated responses. Thus, the vasodilatory role of TRPV channels, and their ligand capsaicin, could be a potential therapeutic target for improving vascular function. Additionally, given the 'sympatholytic' effect of TRPV activation and known endogenous activators (anandamide, reactive  species, H , etc.), TRPV channels might contribute to functional sympatholysis during exercise. To examine the role of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV ) ion channel in the vascular function of human skeletal muscle feed arteries (SMFAs) and whether activation of this heat-sensitive receptor could be involved in modulating vascular function, SMFAs from 16 humans (63 ± 5 years old, range 41-89 years) were studied using wire myography with capsaicin (TRPV agonist) and without (control). Specifically, phenylephrine (α -adrenergic receptor agonist), dexmedetomidine (α -adrenergic receptor agonist), ACh and sodium nitroprusside concentration-response curves were established to assess the role of TRPV channels in α-receptor-mediated vasocontraction as well as endothelium-dependent and -independent vasorelaxation, respectively. Compared with control conditions, capsaicin significantly attenuated maximal vasocontraction in response to phenylephrine [control, 52 ± 8% length-tension (LT ) and capsaicin, 21 ± 5%LT ] and dexmedetomidine (control, 29 ± 12%LT and capsaicin, 2 ± 3%LT ), while robustly enhancing maximal vasorelaxation with ACh (control, 78 ± 8% vasorelaxation and capsaicin, 108 ± 13% vasorelaxation) and less clearly enhancing the sodium nitroprusside response. Denudation of the endothelium greatly attenuated the maximal ACh-induced vasorelaxation equally in the control and capsaicin conditions (∼17% vasorelaxation) and abolished the attenuating effect of capsaicin on the maximal phenylephrine response (denuded + capsaicin, 61 ± 20%LT ). Immunohistochemistry identified a relatively high density of TRPV channels in the endothelium compared with the smooth muscle of the SMFAs, but because of the far greater volume of smooth muscle, total TRPV protein content was not significantly attenuated by denudation. Thus, SMFAs ubiquitously express functional TRPV channels, which alter vascular function, in terms of α -receptors, in a predominantly endothelium-dependent manner, conceivably contributing to the functional sympatholysis and unveiling a therapeutic target.© 2017 The Authors.

Prejunctional α-adrenergic receptors (αARs) provide negative feedback to norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves through inhibition of N-type Ca channels. Increased neuronal norepinephrine release in DOCA-salt and obesity-related hypertension occurs through impaired αAR signaling; however, the mechanisms involved are unclear. Mesenteric arteries are resistance arteries that receive sympathetic innervation from the superior mesenteric and celiac ganglia (SMCG). We tested the hypothesis that macrophages impair αAR-mediated inhibition of Ca channels in SMCG neurons from DOCA-salt and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hypertensive rats. Whole cell patch-clamp methods were used to record Ca currents from SMCG neurons maintained in primary culture. We found that DOCA-salt, but not HFD-induced, hypertension caused macrophage accumulation in mesenteric arteries, increased SMCG mRNA levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and impaired αAR-mediated inhibition of Ca currents in SMCG neurons. αAR dysfunction did not involve changes in αAR expression, desensitization, or downstream signaling factors. Oxidative stress impaired αAR-mediated inhibition of Ca currents in SMCG neurons and resulted in receptor internalization in human embryonic kidney-293T cells. Systemic clodronate-induced macrophage depletion preserved αAR function and lowered blood pressure in DOCA-salt rats. HFD caused hypertension without obesity in Sprague-Dawley rats and hypertension with obesity in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. HFD-induced hypertension was not associated with inflammation in SMCG and mesenteric arteries or αAR dysfunction in SMCG neurons. These results suggest that macrophage-mediated αAR dysfunction in the mesenteric circulation may only be relevant to mineralocorticoid-salt excess. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here, we identify a contribution of macrophages to hypertension development through impaired α-adrenergic receptor (αAR)-mediated inhibition of sympathetic nerve terminal Ca channels in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Impaired αAR function may involve oxidative stress-induced receptor internalization. αAR dysfunction may be unique to mineralocorticoid-salt excess, as it does not occur in obesity-related hypertension.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218671>Effect of reperfusion on vascular smooth muscle reactivity in three contraction models.</a></h1><p>Ischemia and reperfusion remain inseparable elements of numerous medical procedures such as by-pass surgery, organ transplantation or other cardiology and intervention radiology. The contraction of the smooth muscle of the vessel is considered to be one of the basic components leading to impaired perfusion, an increase in the  deficit of the endothelium of the vessel, and subsequently also to tissues vascularized by the vessel. Main aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ischemia and reperfusion on vascular smooth muscle cells stimulated pharmacologically with mastoparan-7 (direct G-protein activator) in comparison to stimulation of G-protein coupled receptor agonist - phenylephrine, and direct calcium channel activator - Bay K8644.Experiments were performed on isolated and perfused tail artery of Wistar rats. Contraction force in our model was measured by increased level of perfusion pressure with a constant flow.Concentration-response curves obtained for phenylephrine, mastoparan-7 and Bay K8644 presented a sigmoidal relation. Ischemia induced hyporreactivity of vessels, whereas during reperfusion the significant time related hyperreactivity for phenylephrine and mastoparan-7 only but not for Bay K8644. These reactions were secondary to the modulation of calcium influx from intra- and extracellular calcium stores.Results of our experiments suggest that mastoparan-7 significantly induces contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells not only for controls but in the presence of ischemia and reperfusion too. Potential therapeutic applications of the observed reactions are important. They may include regenerative processes within the nervous system, studies on the improvement of blood flow within the microcirculation, or antimicrobial activity. Modulation of the G protein-phospholipase C response may also be an interesting point of action of future drugs modifying the response to stimulation during ischemia in particular, such activities could take place during the transport of organs for transplantation.Copyright © 2018.

While it is a relatively safe procedure, it is not without risk. Life-threatening complications, albeit rare, can potentially occur and must be appropriately recognized and treated. We describe 2 cases in which patients' undergoing hip arthroscopy developed pulmonary edema and their respective courses of treatment.Both patients were being treated for symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), with labral tears, requiring operative management after a failed trial of conservative management. The complication occurred during a primary hip arthroscopy procedure and a retrospective review of their clinical records and intra-operative notes was performed.Hip arthroscopy was performed under spinal anesthetic in the supine position in both patients. In both procedures, patients developed severe hypertension and tachycardia, with subsequent  desaturations with noted pulmonary edema. The postulated etiology was systemic effects from intra-articular epinephrine, causing acute pulmonary edema with corresponding cardiovascular changes. With supportive ventilation, selective alpha-adrenergic blocker and furosemide administration, and cessation of epinephrine exposure, vital signs normalized and both patients experienced symptom resolution.During arthroscopy, if acute hypertension, tachycardia and hypoxia develop, epinephrine-induced pulmonary edema should be considered as a cause by the treating orthopedic surgeon and anesthesiologist in order to initiate an appropriate treatment plan.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30096635>Noradrenaline modifies arterial reflection phenomena and left ventricular efficiency in septic shock patients: A prospective observational study.</a></h1><p>To determine whether noradrenaline alters the arterial pressure reflection phenomena in septic shock patients and the effects on left ventricular (LV) efficiency.Thirty-seven septic shock patients with a planned change in noradrenaline dose.

It is widely used in clinical treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. However, the mechanism of how BBR attenuates hypertension through affecting central neural system is not clear.This study was designed to determine whether chronic infusion of BBR into the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) attenuates hypertension and sympathoexcitation via the ROS/Erk1/2/iNOS pathway.Two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) renovascular hypertensive rats were randomly assigned and treated with bilateral PVN infusion of BBR (2μg/h) or vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) via osmotic minipumps for 28 days.2K1C rats showed higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PVN Fra-like activity, plasma levels of norepinephrine (NE), PVN levels of NOX2, NOX4, Erk1/2 and iNOS, and lower PVN levels of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD). Chronic infusion of BBR reduced MAP, PVN Fra-like activity and plasma levels of NE, reduced NOX2, NOX4, Erk1/2, iNOS and induced Cu/Zn-SOD in the PVN.These results suggest that BBR attenuates hypertension and sympathoexcitation via the ROS/Erk1/2/iNOS pathway in 2K1C renovascular hypertensive rats.Copyright © 2018.

By simply mixing solution of NCDs and calcein-Eu, a ratio fluorometric probe with carbon dots as "internal reference" and calcein-Eu as recognition group was constructed for ATP detection. The fluorescence of the calcein can be selectively quenched by Eu, and can be restored when ATP was added because Eu ions exhibit higher affinity to the -donor atoms originated from phosphates than that from carboxylate groups. Meanwhile, fluorescence of NCDs was not affected by Eu, calcein or ATP. By adding NCDs as "internal reference" in the above system, a new ratiometric strategy for detecting ATP was conducted. The dynamic linear range for ATP detection was 5.0 × 10 mol L~ 2.0 × 10 mol L, and the detection limit was 2.0 × 10 mol L.The method was successfully applied to detecting ATP in adenosine disodium triphosphate injection.

The aims, therefore, of the present study were to identify high and low caffeine responders and compare the influence of caffeine on exercise performance and biological responses between groups during a simulated soccer-game protocol on treadmill. : Well-trained soccer players were distinguished as high (n = 11) and low (n = 9) caffeine responders based on resting blood pressure, plasma glycerol, nonesterified fatty acid, and epinephrine responses to caffeine. Participants underwent 2 simulated soccer-game protocols on a treadmill after caffeine (6 mg·kg) or placebo ingestion. Exercise performance and several biological responses were evaluated.  Exercise performance did not differ between the high and low responders to caffeine ( > .05). However, time to fatigue (high, caffeine: 797 [201] s vs placebo: 487 [258] s; low, caffeine: 625 [357] s vs placebo 447 [198] s) and countermovement jump (high, caffeine: 42.1 [5.5] cm vs placebo: 40.5 [5.7] cm; low, caffeine: 41.0 [3.8] cm vs placebo: 38.8 [4.6] cm) improved with caffeine relative to placebo ( < .001). Rating of perceived exertion was lower ( < .001) in high (13.4 [2.3]) than in low responders (14.3 [2.4]) with caffeine ingestion.  Caffeine improved aerobic endurance and neuromuscular performance in well-trained soccer players regardless of their responsiveness to caffeine at rest. Since no changes in substrate utilization were found with caffeine supplementation, performance improvements could be attributed to positive effects on the central nervous system and/or neuromuscular function, although the precise mechanism remains unclear.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28277406>Comparable Neutrophil Responses for Arm and Intensity-matched Leg Exercise.</a></h1><p>Arm exercise is performed at lower absolute intensities than lower body exercise. This may impact on intensity-dependent neutrophil responses, and it is unknown whether individuals restricted to arm exercise experience the same changes in the neutrophil response as found for lower body exercise. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the importance of exercise modality and relative exercise intensity on the neutrophil response.Twelve moderately trained men performed three 45-min constant load exercise trials after determination of peak  uptake for arm exercise (V˙O2peak arms) and cycling (V˙O2peak legs): 1) arm cranking exercise at 60% V˙O2peak arms, 2) moderate cycling at 60% V˙O2peak legs, and 3) easy cycling at 60% V˙O2peak arms.Neutrophil numbers in the circulation increased for all exercise trials, but were significantly lower for easy cycling when compared with arm exercise (P = 0.009), mirroring the blunted increase in HR and epinephrine during easy cycling. For all trials, exercising HR explained some of the variation of the neutrophil number 2 h postexercise (R = 0.51-0.69), epinephrine explaining less of this variation (R = 0.21-0.34). The number of neutrophils expressing CXCR2 decreased in the recovery from exercise in all trials (P < 0.05).Arm and leg exercise elicits the same neutrophil response when performed at the same relative intensity, implying that populations restricted to arm exercise might achieve a similar exercise induced neutrophil response as those performing lower body exercise. A likely explanation for this is the higher sympathetic activation and cardiac output for arm and relative intensity-matched leg exercise when compared with easy cycling, which is partly reflected in HR. This study further shows that the downregulation of CXCR2 may be implicated in exercise-induced neutrophilia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30246320>Inhaled procaterol for the treatment of transient tachypnea of the newborn.</a></h1><p>Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a respiratory disorder that results from inadequate or delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid following delivery. At present, supportive care is generally practiced for the treatment of TTN. In this study, we focused on inhaled beta-agonists for the treatment of TTN, and the aim was to verify the efficacy and the safety of inhaled procaterol for the treatment of TTN.Inhaled procaterol or normal saline solution was administered to infants. Respiratory rate and mixed venous carbon dioxide (PvCO ) were evaluated as the primary outcomes. The duration of hospitalization, duration of  therapy, and changes in respiratory support were evaluated as secondary outcomes.Thirty-seven neonates diagnosed with TTN were randomly assigned to the procaterol group (n = 18) or the placebo group (n = 19).

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of different temperatures (15, 25 and 30°C) on the cardiorespiratory rates and cardiac autonomic tonus of premetamorphic tadpoles of the bullfrog,  To this end, a non-invasive method was developed to permit measurements of electrocardiogram (ECG) and buccal movements (; surface electromyography of the buccal floor). For evaluation of autonomic regulation, intraperitoneal injections of Ringer solution (control), atropine (cholinergic muscarinic antagonist) and sotalol (β-adrenergic antagonist) were performed. Ringer solution injections did not affect heart rate () or  across temperatures. Cardiorespiratory parameters were significantly augmented by temperature (: 24.5±1.0, 54.5±2.0 and 75.8±2.8 beats min at 15, 25 and 30°C, respectively; : 30.3±1.1, 73.1±4.0 and 100.6±3.7 movements min at 15, 25 and 30°C, respectively). A predominant vagal tone was observed at 15°C (32.0±3.2%) and 25°C (27.2±6.7%) relative to the adrenergic tone. At 30°C, the adrenergic tone increased relative to the lower temperature. In conclusion, the cholinergic and adrenergic tones seem to be independent of temperature for colder thermal intervals (15-25°C), while exposure to a hotter ambient temperature (30°C) seems to be followed by a significant increase in adrenergic tone and may reflect cardiovascular adjustments made to match  delivery to demand. Furthermore, while excluding the use of implantable electrodes or cannulae, this study provides a suitable non-invasive method for investigating cardiorespiratory function (cardiac and respiratory rates) in water-breathing animals such as the tadpole.© 2017.

Clinical measures, diffusion metrics, resting-state network and region-to-region functional connectivity patterns, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy absolute metabolite concentrations were analyzed from an independent, age-matched control group of hockey players (n = 26) and longitudinally in concussed athletes within 24 to 72 hours (n = 17) and 3 months (n = 14) after a diagnosed concussion.There were diffusion abnormalities within multiple white matter tracts, functional hyperconnectivity, and decreases in choline 3 months after concussion. Tract-specific spatial statistics revealed a large region along the superior longitudinal fasciculus with the largest decreases in diffusivity measures, which significantly correlated with clinical deficits. This region also spatially intersected with probabilistic tracts connecting cortical regions where we found acute functional connectivity changes. Hyperconnectivity patterns at 3 months after concussion were present only in players with relatively less severe clinical outcomes, higher choline concentrations, and diffusivity indicative of relatively less axonal disruption.Changes persisted well after players' clinical scores had returned to normal and they had been cleared to return to play. Ongoing white matter maturation may make adolescent athletes particularly vulnerable to brain injury, and they may require extended recovery periods. The consequences of early brain injury for ongoing brain development and risk of more serious conditions such as second impact syndrome or neural degenerative processes need to be elucidated.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

We evaluated whether PAF is able to modulate the infection of human macrophages by Leishmania braziliensis, the main Leishmania sp. in Brazil. Monocyte-derived macrophages were incubated with promastigote forms in absence or presence of exogenous PAF. We observed that the treatment of macrophages with low concentrations of PAF prior to infection increased the phagocytosis of L. braziliensis. More importantly, exogenous PAF reduced the parasitism when it was added before, during or after infection. In addition, treatment with a PAF antagonist (PCA 4248) resulted in a significant increase of macrophage infection in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that endogenous PAF is important to control L. braziliensis infection. Mechanistically, while exogenous PAF increased production of reactive  species (ROS) treatment with PCA 4248 reduced oxidative burst during L. braziliensis infection. The microbicidal effects of exogenous PAF were abolished when macrophages were treated with apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. The data show that PAF promotes the production of ROS induced by L. braziliensis, suggesting that this lipid mediator may be relevant to control L. braziliensis infection in human macrophages.© FEMS 2017.

FP/Salm has been shown to control symptoms of asthma and COPD better than a double dose of inhaled steroids. The patient in our report had a history of COPD, and suffered relapse of RP when given only steroids. It is possible that COPD history helps explain this patient's more difficult treatment course. Therefore, this combination may be more effective than inhaled steroids for patients with a history of COPD.This patient suffered adverse reactions triggered by methylprednisolone: weight gain, hyperglycaemia and sleep disturbance after more than two months of intravenous and oral prednisolone. These reactions disappeared when we switched the patients to FP/Salm maintenance therapy.The patient underwent upper right lobectomy in September 2011. Immunohistochemistry indicated low squamous cell differentiation, and he was diagnosed with stage IIB disease (T2N1M0) according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) (7th edition).One month after repeat radiotherapy, the patient experienced fever (37.6°C), cough, chest distress and shortness of breath. We performed serologic tests, laboratory tests for procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, as well as sputum and blood cultures to rule out bacterial infection. Chest CT showed consolidation with air bronchogram in the hilum of the right lung and ground-glass densities in the right lower lobe and left upper lobe. These radiographic signs are typical of RP. Since the patient required , he was diagnosed with grade III RP.After the patinet was diagnosed with grade III RP. The patient was immediately prescribed , anti-infectives for prophylaxis, treatments to facilitate expectoration and prevent asthma, and most importantly, intravenous methylprednisone at an initial dose of 60  per day. And we cut the steroid dose in half every one week when the patient's symptoms improved obviously, and the patchy shadow on the chest radiograph sharply reduced. Then we give him FP (500 mg)/Salm (50 mg) twice daily for two months. Then the dose was halved for an additional two months.The patient showed no signs of tumor or RP relapse by the last follow-up in March 2018.This maintenance therapy of FP/Salm for patient with grade III RP may help avoid relapse when steroid therapy is tapered, particularly for patients with a history of COPD. It may also reduce risk of steroid-associated adverse effects. Based on the results observed with our patient, we intend to design a prospective trial to assess the efficacy of FP/Salm when used as preventive treatment for patients at high risk of RP, and when used as maintenance treatment for patients with grade III RP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28270520>Functional Human Beige Adipocytes From Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.</a></h1><p>Activation of thermogenic beige adipocytes has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target in obesity and diabetes. Relevant human models for beige adipocyte differentiation are essential to implement such therapeutic strategies. We report a straightforward and efficient protocol to generate functional human beige adipocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Without overexpression of exogenous adipogenic genes, our method recapitulates an adipogenic developmental pathway through successive mesodermal and adipogenic progenitor stages. hiPSC-derived adipocytes are insulin sensitive and display beige-specific markers and functional properties, including upregulation of thermogenic genes, increased mitochondrial content, and increased  consumption upon activation with cAMP analogs. Engraftment of hiPSC-derived adipocytes in mice produces well-organized and vascularized adipose tissue, capable of β-adrenergic-responsive glucose uptake. Our model of human beige adipocyte development provides a new and scalable tool for disease modeling and therapeutic screening.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29901150>N‑terminal truncated peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor‑γ coactivator‑1α alleviates phenylephrine‑induced mitochondrial dysfunction and decreases lipid droplet accumulation in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.</a></h1><p>N‑terminal truncated peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor‑γ coactivator‑1α (NT‑PGC‑1α) is an alternative splice variant of PGC‑1α. NT‑PGC‑1α exhibits stronger anti‑obesity effects in adipose tissue than PGC‑1α; however, NT‑PGC‑1α has not yet been investigated in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). The present study aimed to investigate the role of NT‑PGC‑1α in mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism and its possible regulatory mechanism in NRCMs. NRCMs were exposed to phenylephrine (PE) or angiotensin II (Ang II) to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Following this, NRCMs were infected with adenovirus expressing NT‑PGC‑1α, and adenosine 5'‑triphsophate (ATP) levels, reactive  species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane potential were subsequently detected. In addition, western blotting, lipid droplet staining and  consumption assays were performed to examine the function of NT‑PGC‑1α in fatty acid metabolism. NT‑PGC‑1α was demonstrated to be primarily expressed in the cytoplasm, which differed from full‑length PGC‑1α, which was predominantly expressed in the nucleus. NT‑PGC‑1α overexpression alleviated mitochondrial function impairment, including ATP generation, ROS production and mitochondrial membrane potential integrity. Furthermore, NT‑PGC‑1α overexpression alleviated the PE‑induced suppression of fatty acid metabolism‑associated protein expression, increased extracellular  consumption and decreased lipid droplet accumulation in NRCMs. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that NT‑PGC‑1α alleviated PE‑induced mitochondrial impairment and decreased lipid droplet accumulation in NRCMs, indicating that NT‑PGC‑1α may have ameliorated mitochondrial energy defects in NRCMs, and may be considered as a potential target for the treatment of heart failure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28511742>Predictors for routine admission to paediatric intensive care for post-supraglottoplasty laryngomalacia patients.</a></h1><p>Supraglottoplasty for the treatment of laryngomalacia has little current evidence regarding post-operative care. Our study aimed to: (1) retrospectively assess what proportion of patients required paediatric intensive care unit level of care; (2) identify pre-operative predictive factors common to these cases; and (3) report patient outcomes at six weeks' follow up.A 10-year retrospective case series analysis was conducted of all patients diagnosed with laryngomalacia and subsequently treated with supraglottoplasty. Paediatric intensive care unit level of care was defined as the need for intubation or tracheostomy, positive pressure ventilation, multiple doses of nebulised adrenaline, and  dependency beyond 12 hours.Forty-two patients (19 males, 23 females) were identified; 28.5 per cent of cases met our criteria for paediatric intensive care unit level of care. A low pre-operative  saturation was the only significant risk factor that predicted a future need for paediatric intensive care unit level of care (p = 0.0008).This is the first study published in the UK to suggest the importance of pre-operative  saturation as a predictor of a future need for paediatric intensive care unit level of care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28957413>Characterization of immortalized human brown and white pre-adipocyte cell models from a single donor.</a></h1><p>Brown adipose tissue with its constituent brown adipocytes is a promising therapeutic target in metabolic disorders due to its ability to dissipate energy and improve systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. The molecular control of brown adipocyte differentiation and function has been extensively studied in mice, but relatively little is known about such regulatory mechanisms in humans, which in part is due to lack of human brown adipose tissue derived cell models. Here, we used retrovirus-mediated overexpression to stably integrate human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) into stromal-vascular cell fractions from deep and superficial human neck adipose tissue biopsies from the same donor. The brown and white pre-adipocyte cell models (TERT-hBA and TERT-hWA, respectively) displayed a stable proliferation rate and differentiation until at least passage 20. Mature TERT-hBA adipocytes expressed higher levels of thermogenic marker genes and displayed a higher maximal respiratory capacity than mature TERT-hWA adipocytes. TERT-hBA adipocytes were UCP1-positive and responded to β-adrenergic stimulation by activating the PKA-MKK3/6-p38 MAPK signaling module and increasing thermogenic gene expression and  consumption. Mature TERT-hWA adipocytes underwent efficient rosiglitazone-induced 'browning', as demonstrated by strongly increased expression of UCP1 and other brown adipocyte-enriched genes. In summary, the TERT-hBA and TERT-hWA cell models represent useful tools to obtain a better understanding of the molecular control of human brown and white adipocyte differentiation and function as well as of browning of human white adipocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28931543>Effects of intravenous low-dose dopamine infusion on glucose regulation during prolonged aerobic exercise.</a></h1><p>The carotid body chemoreceptors are activated during hypoglycemia and contribute to glucoregulation during prolonged exercise in dogs. Low-dose intravenous infusions of dopamine have been shown to blunt the activation of the carotid body chemoreceptors during hypoxia. Therefore, we tested the hypotheses that dopamine would blunt glucoregulatory responses and attenuate plasma glucose during prolonged aerobic exercise in healthy participants. Twelve healthy participants completed two randomized exercise sessions at 65% peak  consumption for up to 120 min. Saline was infused during one exercise session, and dopamine (2 μg·kg·min) was infused during the other session. Arterial plasma glucose, growth hormone, glucagon, cortisol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were measured every 10 min. Exercise duration during dopamine infusion was 107 ± 6 and 119 ± 0.8 min during saline infusion. Glucose area under the curve during exercise was lower during dopamine (9,821 ± 686 vs. 11,194 ± 395 arbitrary units; P = 0.016). The ratio of circulating growth hormone to glucose and the ratio of glucagon to glucose were greater during dopamine ( P = 0.045 and 0.037, respectively). These results indicate that the infusion of dopamine during aerobic exercise impairs glucoregulation. This suggests that the carotid body chemoreceptors contribute to glucoregulation during prolonged exercise in healthy exercise-trained humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28328824>Early use of noninvasive techniques for clearing respiratory secretions during noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypercapnic encephalopathy: A prospective cohort study.</a></h1><p>Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) might be superior to conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPDs). Inefficient clearance of respiratory secretions provokes NPPV failure in patients with hypercapnic encephalopathy (HE). This study compared CMV and NPPV combined with a noninvasive strategy for clearing secretions in HE and AECOPD patients.The present study is a prospective cohort study of AECOPD and HE patients enrolled between October 2013 and August 2015 in a critical care unit of a major university teaching hospital in China.A total of 74 patients received NPPV and 90 patients received CMV. Inclusion criteria included the following: physician-diagnosed AECOPD, spontaneous airway clearance of excessive secretions, arterial blood gas analysis requiring intensive care, moderate-to-severe dyspnea, and a Kelly-Matthay scale score of 3 to 5. Exclusion criteria included the following: preexisting psychiatric/neurological disorders unrelated to HE, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, upper airway obstruction, acute coronary syndromes, preadmission tracheostomy or endotracheal intubation, and urgent endotracheal intubation for cardiovascular, psychomotor agitation, or severe hemodynamic conditions.Intensive care unit participants were managed by NPPV. Participants received standard treatment consisting of controlled  therapy during NPPV-free periods; antibiotics, intravenous doxofylline, corticosteroids (e.g., salbutamol and ambroxol), and subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin; and therapy for comorbidities if necessary. Nasogastric tubes were inserted only in participants who developed gastric distension. No pharmacological sedation was administered.The primary and secondary outcome measures included comparative complication rates, durations of ventilation and hospitalization, number of invasive devices/patient, and in-hospital and 1-year mortality rates.Arterial blood gases and sensorium levels improved significantly within 2 hours in the NPPV group with lower hospital mortality, fewer complications and invasive devices/patient, and superior weaning off mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation duration, hospital stay, or 1-year mortality was similar between groups.NPPV combined with a noninvasive strategy to clear secretions during the first 2 hours may offer advantages over CMV in treating AECOPD patients complicated by HE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30630797>Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages in application of -driven aerosol and aerosol inhalation by air compressor for the pediatric asthma.</a></h1><p>Present study is done to analyze the advantages and disadvantages in application of -driven aerosol and aerosol inhalation by air compressor for the pediatric asthma. A total of 180 patients with pediatric bronchial asthma were randomized into the -driven aerosol group (Group A, n=90) and the air compressor-driven aerosol group (Group B, n=90). Patients in both groups received 0.5 mg budesonide suspension, 0.2 mg salbutamol and 4 mL normal saline, and following the treatment, we recorded the excellence rate, improvement rate, total effectiveness rate, and the changes in oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) before and after treatment, and the remission time in two groups. In Group A, patients had a higher total effectiveness rate (95.79% vs. 75.79%) but a lower failure rate (4.21% vs. 24.21%) than those in the Group B, with statistically significant differences (p>0.05). Following the aerosol inhalation, SaO2 levels in two groups were ameliorated in comparison with the levels before treatment [Group A: (95.4±0.4) % vs. (80.6±0.8%, Group B: (92.1±1.1)% vs. (79.3±0.7)%] (p<0.05), and the level in Group A following the treatment was higher than that in Group B [(95.4±0.4) % vs. (92.1±1.1)%] (p<0.05). Furthermore, patients in Group A had a longer effective remission time and total remission time than those in Group B, but the differences had no statistical significance (p>0.05). Both of the -driven aerosol inhalation and aerosol inhalation by air compressor can improve the clinical symptoms of pediatric asthma effectively, but -driven aerosol inhalation works more efficiently, with an elevated SaO2. Thus, -driven aerosol inhalation is preferred in clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30081104>Niclosamide  improves kidney injury in db/db mice.</a></h1><p>Early diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is characterized by renal hypertrophy and albuminuria. The mTOR signal pathway is closely related to DKD. This study was performed to determine the renal protection of niclosamide  salt (NEN) which was identified as mTOR inhibitor.Type 2 diabetes (T2D) db/db mice were used and divided into db/db and db/db + NEN groups. Lean wild type mice served as T2D-control. NEN treatment lasted for 12 weeks. The kidney morphological changes, urine indices, blood glucose and metabolic symptoms were evaluated. In addition, the effects of NEN on kidney mitochondria and mTOR/4E-BP pathway were also measured.NEN could prevent diabetic kidney hypertrophy and alleviate glomerular mesangial expansion, attenuate GBM and TBM thickening in db/db mice. It also restored podocyte dysfunction, reduced urinary albumin, NAG, NGAL, and TGF-β1 excretion. Specifically, it could uncouple kidney mitochondria and significantly inhibit renal cortical activation of mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway.This study demonstrated that NEN could improve kidney injury in db/db mice and has the potential to translate to future clinical studies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, scientific information is lacking about the effects of combining these substances on substrate oxidation during exercise. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the isolated and combined effects of p-synephrine and caffeine on fat oxidation rate during exercise.In a double-blind randomized experiment, 13 healthy subjects participated in four experimental trials after the ingestion of a capsule containing a placebo, 3 mg·kg of caffeine, 3 mg·kg of p-synephrine, or the combination of these doses of caffeine and p-synephrine. Energy expenditure and substrate oxidation rates were measured by indirect calorimetry during a cycle ergometer ramp test from 30% to 90% of V˙O2max.In comparison with the placebo, the ingestion of caffeine, p-synephrine, or p-synephrine + caffeine did not alter total energy expenditure or heart rate during the whole exercise test. However, the ingestion of caffeine (0.44 ± 0.15 g·min, P = 0.03), p-synephrine (0.43 ± 0.19 g·min, P < 0.01), and p-synephrine + caffeine (0.45 ± 0.15 g·min, P = 0.02) increased the maximal rate of fat oxidation during exercise when compared with the placebo (0.30 ± 0.12 g·min). The exercise intensity that elicited maximal fat oxidation was similar in all trials (~46.2% ± 10.2% of V˙O2max).Caffeine, p-synephrine, and p-synephrine + caffeine increased the maximal rate of fat oxidation during exercise compared with a placebo, without modifying energy expenditure or heart rate.

Mitochondrial uncoupling, which reduces intracellular lipid loads and corrects the underlying cause of insulin resistance, has emerged as a promising anti-obese and anti-diabetic intervention. Niclosamide is an anthelmintic drug approved by the US FDA with the mechanism of action that uncouples mitochondria of parasitic worms. Recently, niclosamide  salt (NEN) was found to be a safe and effective hepatic mitochondrial uncoupler for the prevention and treatment of obesity and T2D in mouse models. The striking features of NEN prompt us to examine the anti-obese and anti-diabetic efficacy of other salt forms of niclosamide, with the ultimate goal to identify a suitable salt formulation for future clinical development. Here, we report the study with niclosamide piperazine salt (NPP), another salt form of niclosamide with documented safety profile.Mitochondrial uncoupling activity of NEN and NPP were determined by  consumption assay with Seahorse XF24e Analyzer, as well as by mitochondrial membrane potential measurement in cultured cells. The in vivo anti-diabetic and anti-obesity activities were determined in C57BL/6J mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD containing 2000 ppm. NPP for 11 weeks.Niclosamide piperazine salt showed a comparable mitochondrial uncoupling activity to NEN. Oral administration of NPP significantly reduced HFD-induced obesity, hyperglycemia and hepatic steatosis, and sensitized the insulin responses in mice.Niclosamide piperazine salt may hold the promise to become an alternative to NEN as a drug lead for the treatment of obesity and T2D.

Mesh nebulizers reportedly offer the best inhalation efficiency.This study aimed to clarify the utility of the mesh nebulizer, compared to jet nebulizers, in the treatment of pediatric asthma patients. Participants included 88 children <6 years old who were receiving treatment for asthma at Murayama Pediatric Clinic. Heart rate, peripheral  saturation in arterial blood, and Mitsui symptom scores were compared before and after treatment with a mesh nebulizer ( = 43) or jet nebulizer ( = 45) using a salbutamol inhalation solution (0.2 ml for children ≧ 2 years old,  = 51; 0.1 ml for children < 2 years old,  = 37).Other than required inhalation time, clinical findings did not differ between mesh and jet groups. In both groups, heart rate increased significantly in patients treated with 0.2 ml (1000 microg) of salbutamol.The required inhalation time of the mesh nebulizer was superior to the jet nebulizer. Children ≧ 2 years with mild asthma attacks experienced a significantly increased heart rate in both groups.

There is currently a lack of data evaluating hemodynamic effects of epinephrine during neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation.MethodsTwenty-four newborn piglets were exposed to asphyxia. Thereafter, positive pressure ventilation was commenced for 30 s, followed by chest compressions (CC). Piglets were randomized into three experimental groups: 3:1 compression:ventilation ratio; CC during sustained inflation (SI) at a rate of 90 CC per minute, or CC during SI at a rate of 120 CC per minute. Epinephrine (0.01 mg/kg per dose) was administered to a maximum of four doses. Hemodynamic parameters were measured throughout the experiment.ResultsAnimals were divided into survivors and nonsurvivors. End-diastolic and developed pressures declined after epinephrine administration in the survivor group. dp/dt min was significantly higher in the survivor group whereas dp/dt max showed no significant differences. Epinephrine had no effect on either heart rate or cardiac output in both groups. Ejection fraction increased after epinephrine with no significant difference between groups.ConclusionEpinephrine did not affect survival rates or return of spontaneous circulation in our postnatal porcine model of neonatal asphyxia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30038032>Proteomic Delineation of the ArcA Regulon in  Typhimurium During Anaerobiosis.</a></h1><p> serovar Typhimurium ( Typhimurium) is one of the most used models for bacterial pathogenesis and successful infection requires its adaptation to the low  environment in host gastrointestinal tracts. Central to this process is the Arc (erobic espiratory ontrol) two-component regulatory system that contains a sensor kinase ArcB and a response regulator ArcA. Nevertheless, a comprehensive profile of the ArcA regulon on the proteome level is still lacking in  Typhimurium. Here we quantitatively profiled  proteome during anaerobiosis in an -deleting mutant compared with its parental strain. In addition to known processes under its control, notably we found that ArcA represses  utilization by directly binding to the promoter region of the  operon. Furthermore, we found opposing changes of several bacterial genes on the protein and transcript levels in the -deleting mutant including the virulence genes of  pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1), thereby indicating potentially prevalent post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Altogether, our study provides important new insights into ArcA-dependent bacterial physiology and virulence during  anaerobiosis.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864694>Protective effects of Myrica rubra flavonoids against hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cardiomyocyte injury via the regulation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway.</a></h1><p>Myrica rubra is well known for its delicious taste and high nutritional value. The present study investigated the potential protective effects and mechanisms of M. rubra flavonoids (MRF) extract on isoproterenol (ISO)‑induced myocardial injury in rats and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. An in vivo study revealed that MRF decreased serum cardiac enzyme levels, ameliorated pathological heart alterations and increased the antioxidant potential. The in vitro investigation demonstrated that MRF inhibited cell death, reactive  species (ROS) accumulation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, apoptosis rate and caspase‑3 activation and enhanced the Bcl‑2/Bax ratio during H/R injury. These effects were accompanied by the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)‑3β. Further mechanism studies demonstrated that LY294002, a specific inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K), abolished the MRF‑mediated cardioprotection against H/R‑induced apoptosis and ROS overproduction. Collectively, these results suggested that MRF exerts cardioprotective effects by attenuating oxidative damage and cardiomyocyte apoptosis most likely via a PI3K/Akt/GSK3β‑dependent mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30335235>Myoclonus induced by salbutamol: A case report</a></h1><p>Salbutamol is a β2 adrenergic agonist widely prescribed in patients with obstructive and restrictive lung diseases.

Aortic rings were pre-incubated with verapamil (1 µM and 20 µM), gadolinium, apocynin, indomethacin or N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) separately before incubation with nickel.Endothelium intact aortic rings incubated with 100 nM, 1 µM or 100 µM of nickel exhibited 80%, 43% and 28% increase in PE-induced contraction, respectively, while no such enhancing responses were observed in endothelium denuded aorta. Incubation of aortic rings with 1 µM and 20 µM verapamil suggested an involvement of influx of calcium through T-type calcium channels in smooth muscle cells, while aortic rings pre-incubated with gadolinium showed no role of store operated calcium channels in the nickel effect on PE-induced contractions. The enhancing effect of nickel on PE-induced contractions was inhibited by apocynin, indomethacin or L-NAME.Nickel has caused augmentation of PE-induced contractions as a result of the endothelial generation of reactive  species (ROS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) dependent endothelium contracting factors (EDCFs), which increases the influx of extracellular calcium through T-type Ca channels in smooth muscle cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28969461>Inhibition of NADPH oxidase by apocynin promotes myocardial antioxidant response and prevents isoproterenol-induced myocardial oxidative stress in rats.</a></h1><p>Preventive and/or therapeutic interventions for ischemic heart disease have gained considerable attention worldwide. We investigated the mechanism(s) underlying cardioprotection of apocynin (APO) and whether it attenuates isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial damage in vivo. Thirty-two male Wistar Albino rats were randomised into four groups (n = 8 for each group): Group I (Control); Group II (ISO), ISO was given intraperitoneally (ip) (150 mg/kg/d) daily for 2 consecutive days; Group III (APO + ISO), APO was applied ip 20 mg/kg 30 min before the first ISO administration and continued for the next 2 d after the second ISO administration; Group IV (ISO + APO), after the ISO treatment on days 1 and 2, 20 mg/kg APO was given ip on days 3 and 4. Cardioprotective effects of APO were evaluated by biochemical values, histopathological observations and the antiapoptotic relative proteins. Mean blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiography (ECG) were also monitored. Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), oxidative stress index (OSI), caspase-3 and connexin 43 levels were determined. Major ECG changes were observed in the ISO-treated rats. MDA, TOS, OSI and creatine kinase levels decreased and SOD, CAT, GSH and TAC levels increased, indicating that APO reduced cardiac injury and oxidative stress compared with controls. APO also decreased the number of cardiomyocytes with pyknotic nuclei, inflammatory cell infiltration, intracytoplasmic vacuolisation and myofibrils.

The putative mechanism relies on the high pH sensitivity of teleost hemoglobin (Hb), intracellular red blood cell (RBC) pH regulation via β-adrenergic Na/H exchanger (β-NHE) activity, and plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase at the tissues that short-circuits RBC pH regulation. Previous studies have shown that in rainbow trout, this system may double Hb-O unloading to red muscle compared to a situation without short-circuiting. The present study determined that: (1) in rainbow trout this system may be functional even at low concentrations of circulating catecholamines, as shown by conducting a dose-response analysis; (2) Atlantic and coho salmon also possess β-NHE activity, as shown by changes in hematocrit in adrenergically stimulated cells; and (3) with β-NHE short-circuiting, Atlantic and coho salmon may be able to increase Hb-O unloading by up to 74 and 159%, respectively, as determined by modeling based on O equilibrium curves. Together, these results indicate that a system to enhance Hb-O unloading may be common among salmonids and may be operational even under routine conditions. In view of the life histories of Atlantic and coho salmon, a system to enhance Hb-O unloading during exercise may help determine a successful spawning migration and thus reproductive success.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035006>Repositioning of niclosamide  (NEN), an anthelmintic drug, for the treatment of lipotoxicity.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common liver disease associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite its worldwide prevalence, there are no effective drugs for the treatment of NASH. The progression of NASH is mainly accelerated by reactive  species (ROS)-induced lipotoxicity. The transcription factor known as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is pivotal for the elimination of ROS. Accordingly, activators of Nrf2 have been implicated as promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of NASH. Niclosamide ( salt; NEN), a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), is currently used as an anthelmintic drug for the treatment of parasitic infections. Recently, NEN was shown to improve hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. However, the underlying mechanism of its antioxidant function in NASH remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that NEN induces AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of p62 at S351 that can lead to noncanonical Nrf2 activation. We also demonstrate that NEN protects cells and mouse liver from acute lipotoxic stress through activating p62-dependent Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. Taken together, NEN can be used for clinical applications and has the potential to provide a new therapeutic option for NASH.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Participants were randomised to receive two 2.5 mg salbutamol nebulisers, both driven by air or  at 8 L/min, each delivered over 15 min with a 5 min interval in-between. The primary outcome measure was the transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide at the end of the second nebulisation (35 min). The primary analysis used a mixed linear model with fixed effects of the baseline PtCO, time, the randomised intervention, and a time by intervention interaction term; to estimate the difference between randomised treatments at 35 min. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.-driven nebulisation was terminated in one participant after 27 min when the PtCO rose by > 10 mmHg, a predefined safety criterion. The mean (standard deviation) change in PtCO at 35 min was 3.4 (1.9) mmHg and 0.1 (1.4) mmHg in the  and air groups respectively, difference (95% confidence interval) 3.3 mmHg (2.7 to 3.9), p < 0.001. The proportion of patients with a PtCO change ≥4 mmHg during the intervention was 18/45 (40%) and 0/44 (0%) for  and air groups respectively.-driven nebulisation leads to an increase in PtCO in exacerbations of COPD. We propose that air-driven bronchodilator nebulisation is preferable to -driven nebulisation in exacerbations of COPD.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number ACTRN12615000389505 .

After a two-week run in on inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long acting beta-2 agonist (LABA): beclometasone/formoterol 100/6 µg, patients' started additional a long acting muscarinic receptor antagonist: (LAMA) Tiotropium 18 µg, with concomitant weekly dose titration of bisoprolol: 1.25-2.5-5 mg. After a further week of bisoprolol 5 mg, they were stepped back down to (ICS/LABA) for one week. Mean age was 64 years, mean FEV 52% predicted, and mean FEV/FVC ratio of 0.46. Compared to baseline am FEV of 1.38 L (95% CI 1.14-1.61 L), both ICS/LABA/LAMA and ICS/LABA in conjunction with bisoprolol showed statistically significant mean falls of 100 ml (1.28 L, 95% CI 1.03-1.53 L), and 120 ml, respectively (1.26 L, 95% CI 1.01-1.51 L); equalling and exceeding the MCID of 100 ml, respectively.

Key mechanisms of innate immunity are the eradication of pathogens through phagocytosis and the respiratory burst. We tested the concentration-dependent, spontaneous and stimulated (via TNFα and N-formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine) release of reactive  species (ROS) by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in vitro in response to norepinephrine (NE) and AM1241, a pharmacological ligand for the EC receptor CB2. We evaluated phagocytosis of Dectin-1 ligating zymosan particles and tested the cytokine response against Candida antigen in an in vitro cytokine release assay. Increasing concentrations of NE did not affect phagocytosis, yet stimulated ROS release was attenuated gradually reaching maximum suppression at 500 nM. Adrenergic receptor (AR) mechanisms using non-AR-selective (labetalol) as well as specific α-(prazosin) and β-(propranolol) receptor antagonists were tested. Results show that only labetalol and propranolol were able to recuperate cytotoxicity in the presence of NE, evidencing a β-receptor-mediated effect. The CB2 agonist, AM1241, inhibited phagocytosis at 10 µM and spontaneous peroxide release by PMNs. Use of the inverse CB2 receptor agonist SR144528 led to partial recuperation of ROS production, confirming the functional role of CB2. Additionally, AM1241 delayed early activation of monocytes and induced suppression of IL-2 and IL-6 levels in response to Candida via lower activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). These findings provide new insights into key mechanisms of innate immunity under stressful conditions where ligands to the sympatho-adrenergic and EC system are released.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29422100>The influence of norepinephrine and phenylephrine on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation during propofol-remifentanil and propofol-remifentanil-dexmedetomidine anaesthesia in piglets.</a></h1><p>Vasopressors are frequently used to increase blood pressure in order to ensure sufficient cerebral perfusion and oxygenation (CPO) during hypotensive periods in anaesthetized patients. Efficacy depends both on the vasopressor and anaesthetic protocol used. Propofol-remifentanil total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) is common in human anaesthesia, and dexmedetomidine is increasingly used as adjuvant to facilitate better haemodynamic stability and analgesia. Little is known of its interaction with vasopressors and subsequent effects on CPO. This study investigates the CPO response to infusions of norepinephrine and phenylephrine in piglets during propofol-remifentanil and propofol-remifentanil-dexmedetomidine anaesthesia. Sixteen healthy female piglets (25-34 kg) were randomly allocated into a two-arm parallel group design with either normal blood pressure (NBP) or induced low blood pressure (LBP). Anaesthesia was induced with propofol without premedication and maintained with propofol-remifentanil TIVA, and finally supplemented with continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine. Norepinephrine and phenylephrine were infused in consecutive intervention periods before and after addition of dexmedetomidine. Cerebral perfusion measured by laser speckle contrast imaging was related to cerebral oxygenation as measured by an intracerebral Licox probe (partial pressure of ) and transcranial near infrared spectroscopy technology (NIRS) (cerebral  saturation).During propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia, increases in blood pressure by norepinephrine and phenylephrine did not change cerebral perfusion significantly, but cerebral partial pressure of  (Licox) increased following vasopressors in both groups and increases following norepinephrine were significant (NBP: P = 0.04, LBP: P = 0.02). In contrast, cerebral  saturation (NIRS) fell significantly in NBP following phenylephrine (P = 0.003), and following both norepinephrine (P = 0.02) and phenylephrine (P = 0.002) in LBP. Blood pressure increase by both norepinephrine and phenylephrine during propofol-remifentanil-dexmedetomidine anaesthesia was not followed by significant changes in cerebral perfusion. Licox measures increased significantly following both vasopressors in both groups, whereas the decreases in NIRS measures were only significant in the NBP group.Cerebral partial pressure of  measured by Licox increased significantly in concert with the vasopressor induced increases in blood pressure in healthy piglets with both normal and low blood pressure. Cerebral oxygenation assessed by intracerebral Licox and transcranial NIRS showed opposing results to vasopressor infusions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29698395>Personalizing physical exercise in a computational model of fuel homeostasis.</a></h1><p>The beneficial effects of physical activity for the prevention and management of several chronic diseases are widely recognized. Mathematical modeling of the effects of physical exercise in body metabolism and in particular its influence on the control of glucose homeostasis is of primary importance in the development of eHealth monitoring devices for a personalized medicine. Nonetheless, to date only a few mathematical models have been aiming at this specific purpose.

The aim of the present study is to determine the effect of hydrogen on cardiomyocyte autophagy during β‑adrenoceptor activation in vivo and in vitro. We prepared hydrogen‑rich medium, and the concentration of hydrogen was measured by using the MB‑Pt reagent method. For the in vitro study, H9c2 cardiomyocytes were stimulated with isoproterenol (ISO; 10 µM) for 5, 15 and 30 min, and then the protein expression levels of the autophagy marker microtubule‑associated protein 1 light chain 3β II (LC3B II) were examined by western blotting. The effect of hydrogen‑rich medium was then tested by pretreating the H9c2 cardiomyocytes with hydrogen‑rich medium for 30 min, then stimulating with ISO, and examining the protein expression levels of the autophagy marker LC3B II. For the in vivo study, mice received hydrogen (1 ml/100 g/day, by intraperitoneal injection) for 7 days prior to ISO administration (0.5 mg/100 g/day, by subcutaneous injection), and subsequently received hydrogen with or without ISO for another 7 days. Hypertrophic responses were examined by heart weight (HW) and heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) measurements. The protein expression of autophagy markers Beclin1, autophagy‑related protein 7 (Atg7) and LC3B II were examined. The results demonstrated that excessive autophagy occurred following 5 min of ISO stimulation in vitro. This enhanced autophagy was blocked by pretreatment with hydrogen‑rich medium. Furthermore, hydrogen improved the deteriorated hypertrophic responses and inhibited the enhanced autophagic activity mediated by ISO administration in vivo, as indicated by decreasing HW and HW/BW, and suppressing the protein expression levels of Beclin1, Atg7 and LC3B II. Therefore, the results of the present study demonstrated that hydrogen inhibited ISO‑induced excessive autophagy in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy models in vitro and in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29641235>Time course of red blood cell intracellular pH recovery following short-circuiting in relation to venous transit times in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss.</a></h1><p>Accumulating evidence is highlighting the importance of a system of enhanced hemoglobin- (Hb-O) unloading for cardiovascular O transport in teleosts. Adrenergically stimulated sodium-proton exchangers (β-NHE) create H gradients across the red blood cell (RBC) membrane that are short-circuited in the presence of plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase (paCA) at the tissues; the result is a large arterial-venous pH shift that greatly enhances O unloading from pH-sensitive Hb. However, RBC intracellular pH (pH) must recover during venous transit (31-90 s) to enable O loading at the gills. The halftimes ( t) and magnitudes of RBC β-adrenergic stimulation, short-circuiting with paCA and recovery of RBC pH, were assessed in vitro, on rainbow trout whole blood, and using changes in closed-system partial pressure of O as a sensitive indicator for changes in RBC pH. In addition, the recovery rate of RBC pH was assessed in a continuous-flow apparatus that more closely mimics RBC transit through the circulation. Results indicate that: 1) the t of β-NHE short-circuiting is likely within the residence time of blood in the capillaries, 2) the t of RBC pH recovery is 17 s and within the time of RBC venous transit, and 3) after short-circuiting, RBCs reestablish the initial H gradient across the membrane and can potentially undergo repeated cycles of short-circuiting and recovery. Thus, teleosts have evolved a system that greatly enhances O unloading from pH-sensitive Hb at the tissues, while protecting O loading at the gills; the resulting increase in O transport per unit of blood flow may enable the tremendous athletic ability of salmonids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29782242>Case 254: Posttraumatic Migrating Fat Embolus Causing Fat Emboli Syndrome.</a></h1><p>History An otherwise healthy 18-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with a closed displaced fracture of the left femoral shaft ( Fig 1 ) after a high-velocity motorbike accident. At admission, other physical examination findings were unremarkable. Initial unenhanced and contrast material-enhanced (120 mL of Iomeron 400; Bracco Imaging, Milan, Italy) computed tomography (CT) was performed in the arterial and venous phases from the head to the knees. No abnormalities were noted in the brain or chest at initial CT. [Figure: see text] Within a few hours, the patient developed sudden mental confusion and severe hypoxemia, with rapidly worsening tachypnea and perturbed arterial blood gas with low partial pressure of  (61 mmHg [8.1 kPa]; normal range, 75-100 mmHg [10.0-13.3 kPa]) and low partial pressure of carbon dioxide (32 mmHg [4.3 kPa]; normal range, 38-42 mmHg [5.1-5.6 kPa]). A second contrast-enhanced chest CT examination and initial brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were performed. Femoral fracture was stabilized with external fixation, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, with progressive neurologic recovery at day 3 and respiratory improvement at day 4. Treatment included intubation with mechanical ventilation and intravenous administration of steroids and noradrenaline. Afterward, the femoral fracture was stabilized with an intramedullary nail.

Vital signs, pulse oximetry-defined  saturation and modified pulmonary index scores were evaluated before and after the first, second and third doses of nebulised salbutamol and repeated one and 10 days later.We included 304 patients (65.7% male) from median age of 5.3 years (range 1-18 years). Salbutamol-induced hypoxia was detected in 14.7%, 3.9% and 1.3%, respectively, after the first, second and third doses of salbutamol. The risk factors for hypoxia were younger age and a higher modified pulmonary index score, but the risk factors for salbutamol-induced hypoxia were the number of salbutamol doses given in the last six hours and the presence of aeroallergen sensitisation. The maximum decrease in  saturation after salbutamol was %5.Although bronchodilators are the first-line treatment for acute asthma, they caused modest hypoxaemia, especially at repeated doses and, or, in patients with aeroallergen sensitisation.©2017 Foundation Acta Paediatrica.

Here we show that Epi and Fe form stable high-spin complexes in the 1:1 or 3:1 stoichiometry, depending on the Epi/Fe concentration ratio (low or high).  atoms on the catechol ring represent the sites of coordinate bond formation within physiologically relevant bidentate 1:1 complex. Redox properties of Epi are slightly impacted by Fe. On the other hand, Epi and Fe form a complex that acts as a strong reducing agent, which leads to the production of hydrogen peroxide via O reduction, and to a facilitated formation of the Epi-Fe complexes. Epi is not oxidized in this process, i.e. Fe is not an electron shuttle, but the electron donor. Epi-catalyzed oxidation of Fe represents a plausible chemical basis of stress-related damage to heart cells. In addition, our results support the previous findings on the interactions of catecholamine moieties in polymers with iron and provide a novel strategy for improving the efficiency of cross-linking.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28751454>Cysteamine prevents vascular leakage through inhibiting transglutaminase in diabetic retina.</a></h1><p>Cysteamine (an aminothiol), which is derived from coenzyme A degradation and metabolized into taurine, has beneficial effects against cystinosis and neurodegenerative diseases; however, its role in diabetic complications is unknown. Thus, we sought to determine the preventive effect of cysteamine against hyperglycemia-induced vascular leakage in the retinas of diabetic mice. Cysteamine and , the sulfhydryl group-free cysteamine analogue, inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced stress fiber formation and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin disruption in endothelial cells, which play a critical role in modulating endothelial permeability. Intravitreal injection of the amine compounds prevented hyperglycemia-induced vascular leakage in the retinas of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. We then investigated the potential roles of reactive  species (ROS) and transglutaminase (TGase) in the cysteamine prevention of VEGF-induced vascular leakage. Cysteamine, but not , inhibited VEGF-induced ROS generation in endothelial cells and diabetic retinas. In contrast, VEGF-induced TGase activation was prevented by both cysteamine and . Our findings suggest that cysteamine protects against vascular leakage through inhibiting VEGF-induced TGase activation rather than ROS generation in diabetic retinas.© 2017 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29602494>Motor coordination and synaptic plasticity deficits are associated with increased cerebellar activity of NADPH oxidase, CAMKII, and PKC at preplaque stage in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.</a></h1><p>Numerous studies indicate that the cerebellum undergoes structural and functional neurodegenerative changes in Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent of cerebellar alterations at early, preplaque stage of the pathology in TgCRND8 mice through behavioral, electrophysiological, and molecular analysis. Balance beam test and foot-printing analysis revealed significant motor coordination and balance deficits in 2-month-old TgCRND8 mice compared to their littermates. Patch-clamp recordings performed on cerebellar slices of transgenic mice showed synaptic plasticity deficit and loss of noradrenergic modulation at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse suggesting an early dysfunction of the cerebellar circuitry due to amyloid precursor protein overexpression. Finally, western blot analysis revealed an enhanced expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunits p47 and p67 as well as Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C alpha in the cerebellum of 2-month-old transgenic mice. Therefore, we propose the existence of self-sustaining feedback loop involving the formyl peptide receptor 2-reactive  species-Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-protein kinase C alpha pathway that may promote reactive  species generation in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease and eventually contribute to the exacerbation of pathological phenotype.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Current guidelines advise patients at risk of anaphylaxis to carry 2 epinephrine autoinjectors.The objective of this study was to determine risk factors of multiple-dose epinephrine treatment in pediatric food-related anaphylaxis.Parents of children with physician-confirmed diagnosis of food allergy were administered a standardized questionnaire at the time of their clinic visit. These patients were then followed-up prospectively by phone.Six hundred forty-two subjects had allergic reactions. Twenty-six percent of patients reported at least 1 reaction treated with epinephrine, for a total of 221 reactions. Among reactions treated with epinephrine, 24 reactions (11%) received 2 or more doses of epinephrine. The most common triggers were milk (30%) and peanut (18%). Milk-triggered allergic reactions (odds ratio [OR] 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-8.4) and treatment with  (OR 5.0, 95% CI 2.0-12.4) were significant risk factors for requiring multiple doses of epinephrine to treat an allergic reaction.This study demonstrates that treatment of anaphylaxis may require more than 1 epinephrine injection. Reactions triggered by milk or requiring treatment with  are at higher risk for needing more than 1 dose of epinephrine. Families of food-allergic children should be counseled on the importance of carrying 2 epinephrine auto-injectors.Copyright © 2018  . Published by Elsevier Inc.

These innate immune cells express CD18, an adhesion molecule that facilitates leukocyte activation. In the context of fatty liver, activation of infiltrated leukocytes is believed to enhance hepatocellular injury. The objective of this study was to determine the degree to which activated innate immune cells promote steatohepatitis by comparing hepatic outcomes in wild-type and CD18-mutant mice fed a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet. After 3 weeks of MCD feeding, hepatocyte injury, based on serum ALT elevation, was 40% lower in CD18-mutant than wild-type mice. Leukocyte infiltration into the liver was not impaired in CD18-mutant mice, but leukocyte activation was markedly reduced, as shown by the lack of evidence of oxidant production. Despite having reduced hepatocellular injury, CD18-mutant mice developed significantly more hepatic steatosis than wild-type mice after MCD feeding. This coincided with greater hepatic induction of pro-inflammatory and lipogenic genes as well as a modest reduction in hepatic expression of adipose triglyceride lipase. Overall, the data indicate that CD18 deficiency curbs MCD-mediated liver injury by limiting the activation of innate immune cells in the liver without compromising intrahepatic cytokine activation. Reduced liver injury occurs at the expense of increased hepatic steatosis, which suggests that in addition to damaging hepatocytes, infiltrating leukocytes may influence lipid homeostasis in the liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29896798>Renal effects of norepinephrine-induced variations in mean arterial pressure after liver transplantation: A randomized cross-over trial.</a></h1><p>Acute kidney injury is commonly seen after liver transplantation. The optimal perioperative target mean arterial pressure (MAP) for renal filtration, perfusion and oxygenation in liver recipients is not known. The effects of norepinephrine-induced changes in MAP on renal blood flow (RBF),  delivery (RDO ), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal oxygenation (=renal  extraction, RO Ex) were therefore studied early after liver transplantation.Ten patients with an intra- and post-operative vasopressor-dependent systemic vasodilation were studied early after liver transplantation during sedation and mechanical ventilation. To achieve target MAP levels of 60, 75 and 90 mm Hg, the norepinephrine infusion rate was randomly and sequentially titrated. At each target MAP, data on cardiac index (CI), RBF and GFR were obtained by transpulmonary thermodilution (PiCCO), the renal vein thermodilution technique and renal extraction of chromium ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid ( Cr-EDTA), respectively. Renal  consumption (RVO ) and extraction (RO Ex) were calculated according to standard formulas.At a target MAP of 75 mm Hg, CI (13%), RBF (18%), RDO (24%), GFR (31%) and RVO (20%) were higher while RO Ex was unchanged compared to a target MAP of 60 mm Hg. Increasing MAP from 75 up to 90 mm Hg increased RVR by 38% but had no further effects on CI, RBF, RDO or GFR.In patients undergoing liver transplantation, RBF and GFR are pressure-dependent at MAP levels below 75 mm Hg. Our results suggest that MAP should probably be targeted to approximately 75 mm Hg for optimal perioperative renal filtration, perfusion and oxygenation in patients undergoing liver transplantation.© 2018 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

However, so far, occurrence data in the environment are lacking. Within this study NEB has been found for the first time in effluent samples of wastewater treatment plants in Germany with an average concentration of 13 ng L. Its photodegradation behavior in the environment and in technical processes is largely unknown. To fill this gap, three different UV treatment procedures (UV-C at 254 nm, UV-B at 312 nm and UV-A at 365 nm) were investigated in three different matrices: pure water, pure water in presence of the hydroxyl radical (OH) scavenger tert.-butanol and real wastewater. No elimination was observed during UV-A treatment. In contrast, NEB degradation during UV-B and UV-C treatment followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics, with highest removal rate during UV-C treatment in pure water (k = 7.8 × 10 s). The rate constant for UV-C irradiation decreased to 2.9 × 10 s in the presence of the OH scavenger and in the presence of the wastewater matrix. The rate constant for the UV-B lamp was 4.4 × 10 s, Three transformation products were identified after UV-B and UV-C photolytic degradation using high resolution mass spectrometry. The main photoreaction is the substitution of the fluorine atoms of NEB by hydroxyl groups. A photolytic cleavage of the CF bond can be excluded as the high bond dissociation energy of aromatic CF bonds (525 kJ mol), exceeds the energy of electromagnetic radiation applied in the present study (≥254 nm, i.e., max. 471 kJ E). The quantum yields for NEB degradation for the UV-C lamp achieved in pure water, the OH scavenged system and wastewater matrix were Φ = 0.53, 0.19 and 0.22, respectively. For UV-B Φ was 0.023 ± 0.003, noticeable differences in quantum yield were not found. The photooxidation involves reactive  species such as superoxide and singlet .

It is the best established drug in neonatal resuscitation, but only weak evidence supports current recommendations for its use. Furthermore, the available evidence is partly based on extrapolations from adult studies, and this introduces further uncertainty, especially when considering the unique physiological characteristics of newly born infants. The timing, dose, and route of administration of adrenaline are still debated, even though this medication has been used in neonatal resuscitation for a long time. According to the most recent Neonatal Resuscitation Guidelines from the American Heart Association, adrenaline use is indicated when the heart rate remains < 60 beats per minute despite the establishment of adequate ventilation with 100%  and chest compressions. The aforementioned guidelines recommend intravenous administration (via an umbilical venous catheter) of adrenaline at a dose of 0.01-0.03 mg/kg (1:10,000 concentration). Endotracheal administration of a higher dose (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) may be considered while venous access is being obtained, even if supportive data for endotracheal adrenaline are lacking. The safety and efficacy of intraosseous administration of adrenaline remain to be investigated. This article reviews the evidence on the circulatory effects and tolerability of adrenaline in the newborn, discusses literature data on adrenaline use in neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and describes international recommendations and outcome data regarding the use of this medication during neonatal resuscitation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29736684>Regional increase in ROS within stretched region exacerbates arrhythmias in rat trabeculae with nonuniform contraction.</a></h1><p>In diseased hearts, impaired muscle within the hearts is passively stretched by contractions of the more viable neighboring muscle during the contraction phase. We investigated whether in the myocardium with nonuniform contraction such passive stretch regionally generates ROS within the stretched region and exacerbates arrhythmias. In trabeculae from rat hearts, force, intracellular Ca, and membrane potential were measured. To assess regional ROS generation, the slope of the change in the 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence (DCF) was calculated at the each pixel position along the long axis of trabeculae using DCF fluorescence images. Ca waves and arrhythmias were induced by electrical stimulation. A HO (1 mmol/L) jet regionally increased the DCF within the jet-exposed region. A blebbistatin (10 μmol/L) jet caused passive stretch of the muscle within the jet-exposed region during the contraction phase and increased the DCF within the stretched region, the velocity of Ca waves, and the number of beats after electrical stimulation (0.2 μmol/L isoproterenol), while 3 μmol/L diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), NADPH oxidase inhibitor, decreased them. A jet of a solution containing 0.2 mmol/L HO in addition to 10 µmol/L blebbistatin also increased them. A HO jet within the region where Ca waves propagated increased their velocity. In the myocardium with nonuniform contraction, passive stretch of the muscle by contractions of the neighboring muscle regionally increases ROS within the stretched region, and the regional ROS exacerbates arrhythmias by activating the propagation of Ca waves.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28844481>Tert-butylhydroquinone attenuates oxidative stress and inflammation in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus in high salt-induced hypertension.</a></h1><p>Excessive oxidative stress and inflammation in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) are implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension. It is reported that tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), a nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2)-inducer, has a variety of pharmacological activities such as anti-oxidation and anti-inflammatory effect. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of tBHQ in high salt induced hypertension and to identify whether the beneficial effects were induced by inhibiting PVN oxidative stress and inflammation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with high salt diet (HS, 8% NaCl) or normal salt diet (NS, 0.3% NaCl). These rats were administration of tBHQ (150mg/kg/d) by oral gavage for 16 weeks. Our results showed that high salt intake resulted in higher mean arterial pressure, cardiac hypertrophy as well as increased plasma level of norepinephrine and interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 compared with NS rats. It increased PVN level of reactive  species, gp91, IL-1β, IL-6, p-IKKβ and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activity, decreased PVN level of Nrf2 and Cu/Zn-SOD.

Data from patient evaluations performed before and after a change to benzalkonium chloride-containing albuterol were collected. The primary outcome was the rate of poor patient response, defined as a composite endpoint. Secondary outcomes included duration of therapy, dosing requirements, and duration of supplemental  therapy.There was no significant difference in rates of poor response between patients exposed ( = 80) and patients not exposed ( = 48) to benzalkonium chloride (16% and 17%, respectively;  = 0.95). The cohort not exposed to benzalkonium chloride had a median CNA duration of 7.0 hours, as compared with 10.5 hours for the cohort exposed to benzalkonium chloride, but this difference was not significant ( = 0.19). There were no significant differences between the benzalkonium chloride-exposed and nonexposed cohorts in the maximum dosing requirement (12.6 mg/hr versus 12.8 mg/hr,  = 0.89) or median duration of supplemental  use (27.5 hours versus 16.5 hours,  = 0.77).A study of hospitalized patients receiving CNA detected no significant difference in the frequency of poor response to therapy between groups receiving benzalkonium chloride-free versus benzalkonium chloride-containing albuterol products.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

Fumaderm , a fumaric acid ester (FAE) formulation consisting of different FAE salts, has been successfully used to treat psoriasis for decades. Most recently, FAE treatment was reported to inhibit NET formation in murine epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.To elucidate the effect of FAE treatment on human psoriasis and healthy donor NET formation.Among the compounds present in the FAE formulation, dimethyl fumarate (DMF) pretreatment of human psoriasis and healthy donor PMN resulted in a consistent inhibitory effect on NET formation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not to platelet activating factor and ionomycin. This effect was l-glutathione (GSH) dependent and involved a decrease in reactive  species (ROS) production, a key event in NET formation. In contrast, G-protein-coupled signalling and protein synthesis were not involved. Monomethyl fumarate (MMF) was found to slightly reduce ROS production without affecting NET formation.We report DMF as a potent, stimulus-specific, GSH- and ROS-dependent modulator of NET formation. Our results support the notion that modulation of NET formation contributes to the beneficial effects of FAEs in a variety of inflammatory conditions.© 2017 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29151054>Effect of ephedrine and phenylephrine on brain oxygenation and microcirculation in anaesthetised patients with cerebral tumours: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.</a></h1><p>During brain tumour surgery, vasopressor drugs are commonly administered to increase mean arterial blood pressure with the aim of maintaining sufficient cerebral perfusion pressure. Studies of the commonly used vasopressors show that brain  saturation is reduced after phenylephrine administration, but unaltered by ephedrine administration. These findings may be explained by different effects of phenylephrine and ephedrine on the cerebral microcirculation, in particular the capillary transit-time heterogeneity, which determines  extraction efficacy. We hypothesised that phenylephrine is associated with an increase in capillary transit-time heterogeneity and a reduction in cerebral metabolic rate of  compared with ephedrine. Using MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) as measurements in anaesthetised patients with brain tumours, this study will examine whether phenylephrine administration elevates capillary transit-time heterogeneity more than ephedrine, thereby reducing brain oxygenation.This is a double-blind, randomised clinical trial including 48 patients scheduled for surgical brain tumour removal. Prior to imaging and surgery, anaesthetised patients will be randomised to receive either phenylephrine or ephedrine infusion until mean arterial blood pressure increases to above 60 mm Hg or 20% above baseline. Twenty-four patients were allocated to MRI and another 24 patients to PET examination. MRI measurements include cerebral blood flow, capillary transit-time heterogeneity, cerebral blood volume, blood mean transit time, and calculated  extraction fraction and cerebral metabolic rate of  for negligible tissue  extraction. PET measurements include cerebral metabolic rate of , cerebral blood flow and  extraction fraction. Surgery is initiated after MRI/PET measurements and subdural intracranial pressure is measured.This study was approved by the Central Denmark Region Committee on Health Research Ethics (12 June 2015; 1-10-72-116-15).

We hypothesized that consumption of a specific combination of amino acids (arginine, alanine, and phenylalanine; A-mix) may be involved in secretion of glucagon, and when combined with exercise may promote fat catabolism. Ten healthy male volunteers were randomized in a crossover study to ingest either A-mix (3 g/dose) or placebo (3 g of dextrin/dose). Thirty minutes after ingesting, each condition subsequently performed workload trials on a cycle ergometer at 50% of maximal  consumption for 1 h. After oral intake of A-mix, the concentrations of plasma ketone bodies and adrenalin during and post-exercise were significantly increased. The area under the curve for glycerol and glucagon was significantly increased in the post-exercise by A-mix administration. These results suggest that pre-exercise ingestion of A-mix causes a shift of energy source from carbohydrate to fat combustion by increasing secretion of adrenalin and glucagon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29665395>Label-free colorimetric sensor for sensitive detection of choline based on DNAzyme-choline oxidase coupling.</a></h1><p>Changes in choline levels can be associated with diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, fatty liver, interstitial lung abnormalities, autism and so on. Therefore, quantitative determination of choline is important in the biological and clinical analysis. So far, several methods have been investigated for measuring choline in the body fluids, each of which has disadvantages such as the need for specialist ability, complexity, and high cost. For this purpose, a facile and sensitive colorimetric biosensor based on DNAzyme-choline oxidase coupling used for the determination of choline. In this method, the first, choline oxidase produces HO and betaine in the presence of choline and , then, the DNAzyme converts colorless ABTS into green ABTS radicals. Compared to the previous methods, the linear range and the limit of detection of this talented biosensor were 0.1-25 μM and 22 nM. Choline measurement using this biosensor has shown satisfactory selectivity and repeatability. Its recovery was 96.9-103.7%, which shows the reliability of biosensor assay in biological samples. Simplicity, low cost, naked eye, high sensitivity, and precision are the benefits of this biosensor. Taken to gather, the proposed system can be considered as a great biosensor for measuring choline levels especially in point of care diagnostic.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The hormone melatonin (MEL) is known to improve the functional state of mitochondria via an antioxidant effect. Here, the effect of MEL administration on heart mitochondria from aged rats with acute cardiac failure caused by isoprenaline hydrochloride (ISO) was studied. A histological analysis revealed that chronic intake of MEL diminished the age-dependent changes in the structure of muscle fibers of the left ventricle, muscle fiber swelling, and injury zones characteristic of acute cardiac failure caused by ISO. In acute heart failure, the respiratory control index (RCI) and the Ca retention capacity in isolated rat heart mitochondria (RHM) were reduced by 30% and 40%, respectively, and mitochondrial swelling increased by 34%. MEL administration abolished the effect of ISO. MEL partially prevented ISO-induced changes at the subunit level of respiratory complexes III and V and drastically decreased the expression of complex I subunit NDUFB8 both in control RHM and in RHM treated with ISO, which led to the inhibition of ROS production. MEL prevents the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with heart failure caused by ISO. It was shown that the level of 2′,3′-cyclicnucleotide-3′-phosphodiasterase (CNPase), which is capable of protecting cells in aging, increased in acute heart failure. MEL also retained the CNPase content in RHM both in control experiments and after ISO-induced heart damage. We concluded that an increase in the CNPase level promotes cardioprotection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510000>Two distinct profiles of fMRI and neurophysiological activity elicited by acetylcholine in visual cortex.</a></h1><p>Cholinergic neuromodulation is involved in all aspects of sensory processing and is crucial for processes such as attention, learning and memory, etc. However, despite the known roles of acetylcholine (ACh), we still do not how to disentangle ACh contributions from sensory or task-evoked changes in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Here, we investigated the effects of local injection of ACh on fMRI and neural signals in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized macaques by combining pharmaco-based MRI (phMRI) with electrophysiological recordings, using single electrodes and electrode arrays. We found that local injection of ACh elicited two distinct profiles of fMRI and neurophysiological activity, depending on the distance from the injector. Near the injection site, we observed an increase in the baseline blood -level-dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses, while their visual modulation decreased. In contrast, further from the injection site, we observed an increase in the visually induced BOLD and CBF modulation without changes in baseline. Neurophysiological recordings suggest that the spatial correspondence between fMRI responses and neural activity does not change in the gamma, high-gamma, and multiunit activity (MUA) bands. The results near the injection site suggest increased inhibitory drive and decreased metabolism, contrasting to the far region. These changes are thought to reflect the kinetics of ACh and its metabolism to choline.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

Baroreceptor deactivation enhances the MSNA rise during hypoxia in animals. Whether this is true in humans is unknown and was tested in the present study.We assessed MSNA responses elicited by isocapnic hypoxia (10% O2 in N2) during baroreflex loading and unloading with phenylephrine and nitroprusside, respectively, in 19 healthy volunteers. The study was randomized and placebo-controlled.Phenylephrine and nitroprusside increased and decreased, respectively, blood pressure during normoxia and hypoxia, whereas the reverse occurred for heart rate and MSNA (all P < 0.001 vs. placebo). As compared with normoxia, cardiac barosensitivity decreased during the infusion of placebo and nitroprusside in the presence of hypoxia, as well as sympathetic barosensitivity during the infusion of nitroprusside (all P < 0.05). Three patients even disclosed a reduction in arterial pressure, which became apparent at the third minute of hypoxia and worsened steadily thereafter (SBP: 91 ± 7 mmHg; DBP 47 ± 9 mmHg), in spite of a gradual rise in heart rate of 20 ± 4 bpm. Changes in baroreceptor loading conditions did not affect ventilation during normoxia and hypoxia.Cardiac and sympathetic baroreceptor sensitivity decrease during baroreceptor unloading in the presence of peripheral chemoreceptor activation.

However, in Brucella spp. this has not yet been studied. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether experimental infection by Brucella ovis alters the cholinergic activity in pro- or anti-inflammatory responses to the disease. For the study 48 mice were used, 24 infected by B. ovis and 24 non-infected. We collected samples of whole blood on days 7, 15, 30 and 60 post-infection (PI) by B. ovis. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the blood increased on days 15 and 60 PI (P < 0.05). Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity in serum increased on days 7 and 60 PI (P < 0.05). An increase in serum free radical levels occurred on days 7, 15 and 60 PI (P < 0.05), and consequently superoxide dismutase activity increased on day 15 PI (P < 0.05). A reduction in catalase activity occurred when the infection became chronic (60 PI). The increase in AChE and BChE characterized a pro-inflammatory response, since these enzymes regulate levels of acetylcholine (ACh) and butyrylcholine (BuSCh), molecules with anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, with the increase of cholinesterase activity, there was an extracellular reduction of ACh, an inhibitor of several inflammatory mediators. This proinflammatory response of B. ovis infection leads to oxidative stress, and consequently to cellular damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined whether the increase in SO by phenylephrine reflects veno-constriction and to secure filling of the veins, subjects were exposed to head-up tilt (HUT). Phenylephrine (0.2 mg) was administered to 10 healthy males (24 years (22-27; median with interquartile range)) during 40° HUT with SO, OHb and Hb determined for the biceps brachii and vastus lateralis muscles. Changes in red cell volume within the thorax and thigh were evaluated by electrical admittance and brachial vein diameter determined by ultrasound. HUT accumulated blood in arms and legs as indicated by reduced thoracic and conversely enhanced thigh electrical admittance. Both over the arm and leg, HUT reduced SO as a consequence of reduced OHb and increased Hb (p < .05). After 5 min HUT, phenylephrine increased MAP and total peripheral resistance, and both arm and thigh SO increased due to a decrease in Hb and an increase in OHb. The results confirm that SO decreases during HUT and demonstrate venous filling in the limbs. Furthermore, vasoconstriction during HUT is indicated by a decrease in OHb. Conversely, phenylephrine increased SO likely illustrating increased muscle blood flow and venoconstriction as OHb increased while Hb was reduced.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30488718>Therapeutic strategies for pediatric bronchiolitis.</a></h1><p>Bronchiolitis in infancy is the most common infectious reason for hospitalization of infants without any chronic underlying illness. Areas covered: This review focuses on the role of racemic epinephrine, systemic corticosteroids, hypertonic saline and high-flow  therapy (HFOT) in the treatment of infants with bronchiolitis. Literature was searched from Pubmed covering the years 2009-2018 using the entries of bronchiolitis or viral bronchiolitis, and epinephrine, adrenaline, racemic epinephrine, racemic adrenaline, corticosteroids, hypertonic saline, high-flow  therapy, or high-flow  cannula. Expert commentary: Many randomized controlled trials (RCT) have proved the ineffectiveness of beta-agonists, anticholinergics, and inhaled corticosteroids in infants with bronchiolitis. An RCT from Norway suggested that there are bronchiolitis patients, who may benefit from well-timed, on-demand inhalations of racemic epinephrine. Based on two RCTs from Qatar and the United States, the benefits of systemic steroids are marginal and need repeated doses, which increases the risk of adrenal suppression. In new meta-analyses, inhalations of hypertonic saline did not substantially shorten the stay in hospital for bronchiolitis. In two recent RCTs from Australia and New Zealand, HFOT with warmed and humidified air- mixture was superior to traditional low-flow oxygenation. HFOT is the only new and promising approach for treatment of infants with bronchiolitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30191647>Assessment of baroreflex sensitivity has no prognostic value in contemporary, optimally managed patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a retrospective analysis of 5-year survival.</a></h1><p>We evaluated the prognostic value of cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in contemporary, optimally treated patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).Data from 97 patients with HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction 32 ± 6%, all receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker and beta-blocker, 85% receiving aldosterone antagonist) were analysed retrospectively. All patients underwent standard clinical assessment, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and BRS evaluation with three methods: the phenylephrine (BRS-Phe), the sequence (BRS-Seq) and the controlled breathing (BRS-CtrBr) method. Data on 5-year all-cause mortality and appropriate and documented implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) discharges were collected. During a mean follow-up of 53 ± 15 months, the composite endpoint of all-cause death and appropriate and documented ICD discharge occurred in 31 (32%) patients. BRS measures assessed using all three methods were not related to survival in univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses (all P >0.25). There were also no differences in survival between low vs. preserved BRS groups, irrespective of the method used for BRS assessment (all P ≥0.15). BRS-Phe correlated with several clinically important variables (including left ventricular ejection fraction: r  = 0.27, and peak  consumption: r  = 0.32, both P < 0.05), while clinical associations of BRS-Seq and BRS-CtrBr were sparse.Assessment of cardiac BRS provides no prognostic information in the contemporary mild-to-moderate HFrEF population receiving optimal management.© 2018 The Authors.

We conducted various experiments, including treatments with nano zero-valent iron (nZVI), nano-iron/calcium, and calcium oxide (nFe/Ca/CaO) with ozone (O) or hydrogen peroxide (HO) to reduce the concentration of ETA and to decrease the chemical demand of  (COD) of these wastewaters. During this study, wastewater with ETA concentration of 7465 mg L and COD of 6920 mg L was used.

The mechanism(s) for this rapid onset edema may involve more than just increased fluid filtration. Lung endothelial cell permeability is regulated by pressure-dependent activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Herein, we demonstrate that pressure-dependent NOS activation contributes to vascular failure and PE in a model of acute heart failure (AHF) caused by hypertension. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. Acute hypertension was induced by norepinephrine (NE) infusion and resulted in an increase in LVEDP and pulmonary artery pressure (P) that were associated with a rapid fall in PO, and increases in lung wet/dry ratio and injury scores. Heart failure (HF) lungs showed increased nitrotyrosine content and ROS levels. L-NAME pretreatment mitigated the development of PE and reduced lung ROS concentrations to sham levels. Apocynin (Apo) pretreatment inhibited PE. Addition of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) to AHF rats lung lysates and pretreatment of AHF rats with folic acid (FA) prevented ROS production indicating endothelial NOS (eNOS) uncoupling. Pressure-dependent NOS activation leads to acute endothelial hyperpermeability and rapid PE by an increase in NO and ROS in a model of AHF. Acute increases in pulmonary vascular pressure, without NOS activation, was insufficient to cause significant PE. These results suggest a clinically relevant role of endothelial mechanotransduction in the pathogenesis of AHF and further highlights the concept of active barrier failure in AHF. Therapies targetting the prevention or reversal of endothelial hyperpermeability may be a novel therapeutic strategy in AHF.© 2018 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29461966>Anxiety and perceived psychological stress play an important role in the immune response after exercise.</a></h1><p>There are common pathways by which psychological stress and exercise stress alter immunity. However, it remains unknown whether psychological stress plays a role in the in vivo immune response to exercise. We examined the relationship between anxiety and perceived psychological stress reported before exercise and in vivo immunity after exercise using skin sensitisation with Diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP). In a randomised design, sixty four, thoroughly familiarised, males completed widely used psychological instruments to assess state-anxiety and perceived psychological stress before exercise, and ran either 30 minutes at 60% (30MI) or 80% (30HI) V . O2peak, 120 minutes at 60% (120MI) V . O2peak or rested (CON) before DPCP sensitisation. Cutaneous recall to DPCP was measured as the dermal thickening response to a low-dose series DPCP challenge 4-weeks after sensitisation. After accounting for exercise (R2 = 0.20; P < 0.01), multiple-regression showed that pre-exercise state-anxiety (STAI-S; ΔR2 = 0.19; P < 0.01) and perceived psychological stress (ΔR2 = 0.13; P < 0.05) were moderately associated with the DPCP response after exercise. The STAI-S scores before exercise were considered low-to-moderate in these familiarised individuals (median split; mean STAI-S of low 25 and moderate 34). Further examination showed that the DPCP response after exercise (30MI, 30HI or 120MI) was 62% lower in those reporting low vs. moderate state-anxiety before exercise (mean difference in dermal thickening: -2.6 mm; 95% CI: -0.8 to -4.4 mm; P < 0.01). As such, the results indicate a beneficial effect of moderate (vs. low) state-anxiety and perceived psychological stress on in vivo immunity after exercise. Moreover, correlations were of comparable strength for the relationship between physiological stress (heart rate training impulse) and the summed dermal response to DPCP (r = -0.37; 95% CI: -0.05 to -0.62; P = 0.01), and state-anxiety and the summed dermal response to DPCP (r = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.63; P < 0.01). In conclusion, state-anxiety and perceived psychological stress levels before exercise play animportant role in determining the strength of the in vivo immune response after exercise. These findings indicate a similar strength relationship for the level of state-anxiety prior to exercise and the level of physiological stress during exercise with the in vivo immune response after exercise. Future research is required to investigate exercise-immune responses in athletes, military personnel and others in physically demanding occupations experiencing higher levels of psychological stress than those reported in this study e.g. related to important competition, military operations and major life events. Nevertheless, the present findings support the recommendation that exercise scientists should account for anxiety and psychological stress when examining the immune response to exercise.Copyright © 2016 International Society of Exercise and Immunology.

In vitro continuous culture of Plasmodium falciparum is a fundamental requirement when undertaking malaria research where the primary objectives utilise viable parasites of a desired lifecycle stage. This investigation, and resulting data, compared the impact culturing Plasmodium falciparum long term (4 months) in different environmental conditions had on experimental outcomes and thus conclusions. The example presented here focused specifically on the effect culture conditions had on the in vitro tolerance of Plasmodium falciparum to standard anti-malarial drugs, including artemisinin and lumefantrine. Historical data from an independent experiment for 3D7-ALB (5% O) was also compared with that obtained from this study.

To explore the mechanism of Mab's antagonizing the proliferation, Mdivi-1, DRP1 inhibitor, which has an inhibitory effect on mitochondrial fission, is used to compare with Mab. Cell viability was measured by either MTT or CCK-8. The inhibitory effect of Mab on S phase of ASM cell cycle induced by PDGF-BB was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). Fluo-3/AM, Ca fluorescent probe, was used to detect Ca fluorescence intensity by inverted microscope and flow cytometry. The gene expression of Drp-1 and Mfn-2 was observed with Real time PCR and the proteins of Drp-1, Mfn-2, PCNA and cyclin D1 were assessed by Western Blot. Mab and Mdivi-1 both suppressed the proliferation induced by PDGF-BB. The results from inverted microscope and flow cytometry showed that Mab inhibited [Ca]i in rat ASMCs induced by PDGF-BB. Cell cycle concept map illustrated that Mab significantly controlled the S phase of ASM cell cycle induced by PDGF-BB. As a consequence, Real time PCR and Western blot revealed the fact that Mab decreased the expression of Drp-1 mRNA and protein, and promoted the expression of Mfn-2 mRNA and protein. These findings suggested that Mab placed restrictions on the proliferation of rat ASMCs induced by PDGF-BB and the mechanism might be associated with the intracellular calcium inhibited and the mitochondrial fission/fusion regulated by Mab.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, further knowledge is needed about prolonged eccentric exercise. This work sought to investigate the cardiovascular responses to prolonged constant-load eccentric compared to concentric cycling. Ten healthy males performed two 45-min exercise sessions of either concentric or eccentric cycling separated by a month and matched for heart rate during the first 5 min of exercise. Cardiorespiratory, autonomic nervous system and vascular responses were assessed at rest, and during exercise and recovery. During cycling,  uptake, cardiac output and systolic blood pressure were similar but heart rate and diastolic blood pressure were greater whereas stroke volume was lower during eccentric than concentric cycling (118±21 vs. 104±10 bpm; 77±9 vs. 65±8 mmHg; 122±12 vs. 135±13 mL). Baroreflex and noradrenaline concentration were altered during eccentric cycling, and after eccentric exercise, vascular tone was greater than after concentric cycling. We observed increased cardiovascular strain and altered baroreflex activity during eccentric compared with concentric exercise, suggesting eccentric cycling triggers greater sympathetic activity.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28631554>The Effects of Platelet-Activating Factor on Uterine Contractility, Perfusion, Hypoxia, and Pain in Mice.</a></h1><p>It is widely hypothesized that menstrual pain is triggered by prostaglandin synthesis that evokes high-pressure uterine contractions and ischemia. However, the effects of molecules implicated in menstrual pain on uterine contractility, perfusion, and oxygenation in vivo have been rarely demonstrated. Studies in women that do not respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have reported elevated levels of platelet-activating factor (PAF). To establish in vivo evidence of PAF's capability to impair uterine homeostasis and to elicit visceral pain, we examined the effects of the PAF receptor agonist (carbamyl PAF [CPAF]) in comparison to other molecules hypothesized to play a role in uterine pain in mice. Uterine pressure was increased by oxytocin, prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α), and CPAF. Even in the absence of inflammatory molecules, uterine contractions reduced uterine oxygenation by 38%. CPAF reduced uterine perfusion by 40% ± 8% and elicited further  desaturation approaching hypoxia (9.4 ± 3.4 mm Hg Pao). Intraperitoneal injections of CPAF and PGF2α evoked visceral pain and pelvic hyperalgesia in awake wild-type mice. However, pain was not observed in identically injected PAF-receptor knockout mice. Thus, our model provides a demonstration that a molecule implicated in NSAID-resistant dysmenorrhea has a detrimental effect on uterine homeostasis and is capable of causing visceral pain. Our results support the general hypothesis that menstrual cramps are caused by uterine contractions, impaired perfusion, and reduced oxygenation. Since this study was limited to mice, confirmation of these results in humans would be valuable for development of novel therapeutics targeted at inflammatory precursors, contractility, perfusion, and tissue oxygenation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28623178>Adrenal-derived stress hormones modulate ozone-induced lung injury and inflammation.</a></h1><p>Ozone-induced systemic effects are modulated through activation of the neuro-hormonal stress response pathway. Adrenal demedullation (DEMED) or bilateral total adrenalectomy (ADREX) inhibits systemic and pulmonary effects of acute ozone exposure. To understand the influence of adrenal-derived stress hormones in mediating ozone-induced lung injury/inflammation, we assessed global gene expression (mRNA sequencing) and selected proteins in lung tissues from male Wistar-Kyoto rats that underwent DEMED, ADREX, or sham surgery (SHAM) prior to their exposure to air or ozone (1ppm), 4h/day for 1 or 2days. Ozone exposure significantly changed the expression of over 2300 genes in lungs of SHAM rats, and these changes were markedly reduced in DEMED and ADREX rats. SHAM surgery but not DEMED or ADREX resulted in activation of multiple ozone-responsive pathways, including glucocorticoid, acute phase response, NRF2, and PI3K-AKT. Predicted targets from sequencing data showed a similarity between transcriptional changes induced by ozone and adrenergic and steroidal modulation of effects in SHAM but not ADREX rats. Ozone-induced increases in lung Il6 in SHAM rats coincided with neutrophilic inflammation, but were diminished in DEMED and ADREX rats. Although ozone exposure in SHAM rats did not significantly alter mRNA expression of Ifnγ and Il-4, the IL-4 protein and ratio of IL-4 to IFNγ (IL-4/IFNγ) proteins increased suggesting a tendency for a Th2 response. This did not occur in ADREX and DEMED rats. We demonstrate that ozone-induced lung injury and neutrophilic inflammation require the presence of circulating epinephrine and corticosterone, which transcriptionally regulates signaling mechanisms involved in this response.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29672963>Butein protects the nonalcoholic fatty liver through mitochondrial reactive  species attenuation in rats.</a></h1><p>One of the worldwide metabolic health dilemma is nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Researchers are searching effective drug to manage NAFLD patients. One of the best way to manage the metabolic imperfection is through natural principal isolated from different sources. Butein, a natural compound known to have numerous pharmacological application. In the current study we assessed the therapeutic effect of butein administration on liver function tests, oxidative stress, antioxidants, lipid abnormalities, serum inflammatory cytokines, and mitochondrial reactive  species levels, in rats with methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NAFLD. Male Wistar rats were treated with MCD diet with/without butein (200 mg/kg body wt. orally) for 6 weeks. The protective effect of butein, were evident from decreased transaminase activities, restoration of albumin, globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, and oxidants in serum (P < 0.01), further it improved liver antioxidant status (P < 0.01). Butein significantly lowered lipid profile parameters (P < 0.01), suppressed inflammatory cytokines (P < 0.01), and improved liver histology. Further to understand the possible mechanism behind the hepatoprotective and lipid lowering effect of butein, the activities of heme oxygenase (HO1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS) were measured. We found that butein supplementation significantly decreased the activity of HO1 (P < 0.001), and increased the activity of MPO (P < 0.001). Furthermore butein attenuated mitochondrial ROS produced in NAFLD condition. Present study shows that butein supplementation restore liver function by altering liver oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, vital defensive enzyme activities, and mitochondrial ROS. In summary, butein has remarkable potential to develop effective hepato-protective drug.© 2018 BioFactors, 44(3):289-298, 2018.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30398424>Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema associated with ozone exposure in three kittens.</a></h1><p>CASE DESCRIPTION Three 21-week-old sexually intact female sibling domestic shorthair cats were brought to an emergency clinic because of signs of sudden respiratory distress that were noted by the owner after the cats had been confined for approximately 10 hours in a room with an operating ozone-generating air purifier. No other potential toxicant exposures were reported. CLINICAL FINDINGS On initial examination, the 3 cats were severely dyspneic and tachypneic. Pulmonary crackles were audible on thoracic auscultation. Thoracic radiography revealed a marked peribronchial, unstructured interstitial pulmonary pattern that coalesced to a patchy alveolar pattern, consistent with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME A diuretic (furosemide, 2 mg/kg [0.9 mg/lb], IV) and bronchodilator (terbutaline sulfate, 0.01 mg/kg [0.005 mg/lb], IM) were administered, and supplemental  was provided by placing the cats in an  cage at 80%  saturation. By 24 hours after placement in the  cage, all cats had unremarkable respiratory rates and thoracic auscultation findings. Complete resolution of the respiratory signs and radiographic pulmonary lesions was achieved within 48 to 72 hours after initial evaluation. At a recheck examination performed 3 months after initial evaluation, the cats remained free of respiratory signs, and no radiographic pulmonary lesions were detected. CLINICAL RELEVANCE To the authors' knowledge, this was the first reported case of pulmonary toxicosis believed to have been caused by ozone exposure in cats. Associated respiratory signs were successfully and rapidly reversed following  supplementation and medical treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28347224>Crocodile choline from Crocodylus siamensis induces apoptosis of human gastric cancer.</a></h1><p>Crocodile choline, an active compound isolated from Crocodylus siamensis, was found to exert potent anti-cancer activities against human gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Our study revealed that crocodile choline led to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase through attenuating the expressions of cyclins, Cyclin B1, and CDK-1. Furthermore, crocodile choline accelerated apoptosis through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway with the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, the increase in reactive  species production and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and the activation of caspase-3 along with the release of cytochrome c. In addition, this study, for the first time, shows that Notch pathway is remarkably deregulated by crocodile choline. The combination of crocodile choline and Notch1 short interfering RNA led to dramatically increased cytotoxicity than observed with either agent alone. Notch1 short interfering RNA sensitized and potentiated the capability of crocodile choline to suppress the cell progression and invasion of gastric cancer. Taken together, these data suggested that crocodile choline was a potent progression inhibitor of gastric cancer cells, which was correlated with mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and Notch pathway. Combining Notch1 inhibitors with crocodile choline might represent a novel approach for gastric cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30221704>Comparing the role of Ginkgolide B and Ginkgolide K on cultured astrocytes exposed to ‑glucose deprivation.</a></h1><p>Ginkgolide B (GB) and ginkgolide K (GK) are two main active monomers of ginkgolides that present a unique group of diterpenes found naturally in the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type within the central nervous system (CNS) and serve essential roles in maintaining healthy brain function. The present study compared the biological effects of GB and GK on astrocytes exposed to ‑glucose deprivation (OGD). The results demonstrated that GB and GK exhibit many different actions. The level of the platelet‑activating factor (PAF) was elevated on astrocytes exposed to OGD, and inhibited by GB and GK treatment. Although GB and GK inhibited the expression of p‑NF‑κB/p65, GK exerted stronger anti‑inflammatory and antioxidant effects on astrocytes exposed to OGD than GB by inhibiting interleukin (IL)‑6 and tumor necrosis factor‑α, and inducing IL‑10 and the nuclear factor‑erythroid 2‑related factor 2/HO‑1 signaling pathway. When compared with GB treatment, GK treatment maintained high levels of phosphoinositide 3‑kinase/phosphorylated‑protein kinase B expression, and induced a marked upregulation of Wnt family member 1 and brain derived neurotrophic factor, indicating that GK, as a natural plant compound, may have more attractive prospects for clinical application in the treatment of neurological disorders than GB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29243009>Adrenaline induces mitochondrial biogenesis in rat liver.</a></h1><p>We studied the effects of adrenaline administration and depletion (induced by reserpine) on rat liver oxidative metabolism. We showed that adrenaline increases, and reserpine decreases aerobic capacity (inferred by cytochrome oxidase activity) in tissue modifying the hepatic content of mitochondrial proteins without changing mitochondrial aerobic capacity. The changes in tissue cytochrome oxidase activity, which agreed with the expression levels of factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, such as PGC-1, NRF-1, and NRF-2, were associated with similar changes in tissue and mitochondrial State 3 respiration. Adrenaline and reserpine induced extensive lipid and protein oxidative damage in tissue and mitochondria. The increase in HO release by respiring mitochondria and the decrease in the activities of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and reductase contributed to the reserpine effect on oxidative damage. The adrenaline effect is more difficult to explain, since the hormone increased the antioxidant enzyme activities but, in respiring mitochondria, increased ROS release rate in the presence of succinate and decreased it in the presence of pyruvate/malate. These opposite changes were due to the increased content of the autoxidizable electron carrier located at complex III and decreased content of that located at complex I. Our data suggest that adrenaline can be involved in the mitochondrial population adaptation which verify in conditions in which an increased body energy expenditure verify such as cold exposure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340856>Multifocal pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma in a 29-year-old woman with cyanotic congenital heart disease.</a></h1><p>Multifocal pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma presenting at an early age is commonly associated with a hereditary syndrome.A 29-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of multifocal pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. Interestingly, her family history did not include pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, and comprehensive genetic testing for the well-documented pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma susceptibility genes was negative. Of note, this patient had a history of a complex cardiac defect resulting in cyanotic congenital heart disease and had never undergone operative repair. Thus she lived in a chronic hypoxic state with a baseline  saturation of about 80%. Laboratory evaluation found marked increases in plasma norepinephrine and normetanephrines with normal epinephrine and metanephrines. Imaging revealed 4 aortocaval masses and a right adrenal mass. After appropriate preoperative preparation she underwent successful resection of each of the neoplasms, with pathologic testing revealing multifocal pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma.This case highlights a growing recognition of the potential development of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. The underlying pathophysiology and phenotypic similarities between pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease and those with mutations that lead to cellular pseudohypoxia are reviewed.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Dietary and genetic deficiencies in folate metabolism result in elevated levels of homocysteine which have been linked to increased risk of developing a stroke. Reducing levels of homocysteine before or after a stroke through B-vitamin supplementation has been a focus of many clinical studies, however, the results remain inconsistent. Animal model systems provide a powerful mechanism to study and understand functional impact and mechanisms through which supplementation affects stroke recovery. The aim of this study was to understand the role of B-vitamins in stroke pathology using in vivo and in vitro mouse models. The first objective assessed the impact of folate deficiency prior to ischemic damage followed by B-vitamins and choline supplementation. Ischemic damage targeted the sensorimotor cortex. C57Bl/6 wild-type mice were maintained on a folic acid deficient diet for 4weeks prior to ischemic damage to increased levels of plasma homocysteine, a risk factor for stroke. Post-operatively mice were placed on a B-vitamin and choline supplemented diet for a period of four weeks, after which motor function was assessed in mice using the rotarod, ladder beam and forepaw asymmetry tasks. The second objective was to determine how a genetic deficiency in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), an enzyme involved in folate metabolism, increases vulnerability to stroke. Primary cortical neurons were isolated from Mthfr, Mthfr and Mthfr embryos and were exposed to in vitro models of stroke which include hypoxia or  glucose deprivation. Cell viability was measured 24-h after exposure stroke like conditions in vitro. In supplemented diet mice, we report improved motor function after ischemic damage compared to mice fed a control diet after ischemic damage. Within the perilesional cortex, we show enhanced proliferation, neuroplasticity and anti-oxidant activity in mice fed the supplemented diet. A genetic MTHFR deficiency resulted in neurodegeneration after exposure to in vitro models of stroke, by activating apoptosis promoting p53-dependent mechanisms. These results suggest that one-carbon metabolism plays a significant role in recovery after stroke and MTHFR deficiency contributes to poor recovery from stroke.Crown Copyright © 2017.

After an overnight fast, participants ingested either a placebo or 150mg of octopamine 60min prior to exercise. Trials consisted of 30min of cycle exercise at 55% peak power output, followed by a 30min performance task whereby participants completed as much work (kJ) as possible.Performance was similar between the experimental trials (placebo: 352.8±39kJ; octopamine: 350.9±38.3kJ; Cohen's d effect size=0.05; p=0.380). Substrate oxidation and circulating concentrations of free fatty acids, prolactin and cortisol were similar between trial conditions (all p>0.05). There were also no differences across trials for heart rate or perceived exertion during exercise (both p>0.05).Acute supplementation with a low dose of octopamine did not influence endurance cycle performance, substrate oxidation or circulating hormonal concentrations, which could be due to the low serum octopamine concentrations observed. Future studies should investigate the influence of larger doses of octopamine in recreationally active and well-trained individuals during prolonged exercise in temperate and high ambient conditions.Copyright © 2017 Sports Medicine Australia.

Isoproterenol (ISP)-induced myocardial ischemia is a classical model to screen the cardioprotective effects of various pharmacological interventions. Phytochemicals present a novel option for treating various human maladies including those of the heart. A large number of plant products and their active ingredients have been screened for efficacy in ameliorating ISP-induced myocardial ischemia including coriander, curcumin, Momordica, quercetin, and Withania somnifera. These phytochemicals constituents may play key role in preventing disease and help in cardiac remodeling. Reactive  species scavenging, antiinflammatory, and modulation of various molecular pathways such as Nrf2, NFкB, p-21 activated kinase 1 (PAK1), and p-smad2/3 signaling modulation have been implicated behind the claimed protection. In this review, we have provided a focused overview on the utility of ISP-induced cardiotoxicity, myocardial ischemia, and cardiac fibrosis for preclinical research. In addition, we have also surveyed molecular mechanism of various plant-based interventions screened for cardioprotective effect in ISP-induced cardiotoxicity, and their probable mechanistic profile is summarized.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29630639>Phenylephrine does not improve oxygenation during one-lung ventilation: A randomized, double-blind, cross-over study.</a></h1><p>Phenylephrine is an α1 adrenergic receptor agonist that causes pulmonary vasoconstriction, and so may effectively enhance hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). However, there is little evidence that phenylephrine augments HPV in clinical situations. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of phenylephrine infusion on oxygenation during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Included patients were those undergoing elective thoracic surgery in the lateral decubitus position with OLV. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. The N-P group initially had OLV with normal saline infusion for 30 minutes; after a 10 minute interval, OLV was then maintained with phenylephrine infusion for 30 minutes.

Group E received boluses of ephedrine 6mg, and Group P phenylephrine 100µg, titrated to maintain systolic blood pressure near baseline values. Neonatal heart rates at 10 and 30-45min of age,  saturation and capillary blood glucose at 30min, and capillary blood lactate and urine metamphetamine were recorded.Neonatal heart rate at 10min was significantly higher (mean difference 4.0, 95%CI 0.6 to 7.3, P=0.02) in Group E versus Group P, but this was not clinically relevant. There was a linear correlation between neonatal heart rate at 10min and ephedrine dose in Group E (r=0.29, 95%CI 0.22, 0.74, p<0.01). The decremental changes in neonatal heart rate at 10 and 30min were significantly greater in Group E. Urine metamphetamine tests were positive in 19% of 44 neonatal urine samples. Neonatal heart rates at 30min,  saturation, capillary blood glucose and the incidence of tachycardia, respiratory problems or abnormal glucose, were not significantly different.Ephedrine, compared to phenylephrine as a vasopressor during cesarean delivery, was associated with higher neonatal heart rate in the early post-birth period, but without a significant difference in clinical outcomes in uncomplicated pregnancies.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Several epidemiological studies and experimental approaches have demonstrated that consumption of polyphenol-enriched fruits and vegetables can promote cardioprotection. Thus, diet plays a key role in CVD development and/or prevention. Physiological β-adrenergic stimulation promotes beneficial inotropic effects by increasing heart rate, contractility and relaxation speed of cardiomyocytes. Nevertheless, chronic activation of β-adrenergic receptors can cause arrhythmias, oxidative stress and cell death. Herein the cardioprotective effect of human metabolites derived from polyphenols present in berries was assessed in cardiomyocytes, in response to chronic β-adrenergic stimulation, to disclose some of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Ventricular cardiomyocytes derived from neonate rats were treated with three human bioavailable phenolic metabolites found in circulating human plasma, following berries' ingestion (catechol-O-sulphate, pyrogallol-O-sulphate, and 1-methylpyrogallol-O-sulphate). The experimental conditions mimic the physiological concentrations and circulating time of these metabolites in the human plasma (2 h). Cardiomyocytes were then challenged with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO) for 24 h. The presence of phenolic metabolites limited ISO-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress. Likewise, phenolic metabolites increased cell beating rate and synchronized cardiomyocyte beating population, following prolonged β-adrenergic receptor activation. Finally, phenolic metabolites also prevented ISO-increased activation of PKA-cAMP pathway, modulating Ca signalling and rescuing cells from an arrhythmogenic Ca transients' phenotype. Unexpected cardioprotective properties of the recently identified human-circulating berry-derived polyphenol metabolites were identified. These metabolites modulate cardiomyocyte beating and Ca transients following β-adrenergic prolonged stimulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29866674>Uncommon presentation of a common disease: influenza A presenting as adult croup .</a></h1><p>An 88-year-old woman presented to our emergency room with complaints of fever, coryza, barking cough and generalised fatigue for 2 days.

Many runners wear arm warmers to protect against cold. However, the effects of these warmers remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the effect of arm insulation on physiological responses during running in a cold environment.Twelve healthy men (mean±SD age, 22.4±3.9 years; height, 1.71±0.07 m; mass, 66.9±8.1 kg; maximal  consumption, 52.3±4.79 mL/kg/min) ran on a treadmill at an intensity of 70% maximal  consumption for 30 minutes in a climatic chamber at 5 °C wearing (ARM) or not wearing (CON) a tight-fitting polyester sleeve on the forearm.During the first 10 minutes of exercise, esophageal temperature was significantly higher (P<0.05) in ARM than in CON. Weighted mean skin temperature was significantly higher (P<0.05) in ARM than in CON. Thermal sensation was significantly higher (P<0.05) in ARM than in CON during rest and during the first 10 minutes of exercise.

We recently identified that vaccarin protected endothelial cell function from oxidative stress or high glucose. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether vaccarin attenuated hypertension and cardiovascular remodeling. Two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) model rats were used, and low dose of vaccarin (10 mg/kg), high dose of vaccarin (30 mg/kg), captopril (30 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally administrated. Herein, we showed that 2K1C rats exhibited higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), left ventricular mass/body weight ratio, myocardial hypertrophy or fibrosis, media thickness, and media thickness to lumen diameter, which were obviously alleviated by vaccarin and captopril. In addition, both vaccarin and captopril abrogated the increased plasma renin, angiotensin II (Ang II), norepinephrine (NE), and the basal sympathetic activity. The AT1R protein expressions, NADPH oxidase subunit NOX-2 protein levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were significantly increased, whereas superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were decreased in myocardium, aorta, and mesenteric artery of 2K1C rats, both vaccarin and captopril treatment counteracted these changes in renovascular hypertensive rats. Collectively, we concluded that vaccarin may be a novel complementary therapeutic medicine for the prevention and treatment of hypertension. The mechanisms for antihypertensive effects of vaccarin may be associated with inhibition of sympathetic activity, RAS, and oxidative stress.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28647611>Autophagy suppresses isoprenaline-induced M2 macrophage polarization via the ROS/ERK and mTOR signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to examine the effect of autophagy on stress-induced M2 macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment of breast cancer and to determine whether the underlying mechanism was related to the reactive  species (ROS)/ERK and mTOR pathway. In vitro, we found that the basal autophagy level in mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages decreased with the incubation of tumor cell culture supernatant. Similarly, the polarization of RAW 264.7 to M2 macrophages was inhibited by the autophagy inducer rapamycin and increased by the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA or by siBeclin1. In addition, we found that not only was M2 molecule expression down-regulated but intracellular ROS generation was also blocked by autophagy induction. In vivo, we observed that mice that received an isoprenaline injection as a stress agent exhibited augmented implanted breast tumor growth, lung metastasis, intratumoral mRNA expression of M2 molecules and serum ROS generation. In contrast, the intratumoral expression of LC3-II and Beclin1 was decreased. In addition, we observed that isoprenaline induced the up-regulation of the intratumoral expression of phosphorylated mTOR, phosphorylated ERK1/2, phosphorylated Tyr705-STAT3 and HIF-1α, whereas rapamycin induced an opposite effect on the same molecules and could abolish the effects of isoprenaline. These results suggest that autophagy might suppress M2 macrophage polarization induced by isoprenaline via the ROS/ERK and mTOR signaling pathway. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for why high levels of stress hormones accelerate the progression of breast cancer, and autophagy may play a role in determining the outcomes of cancer therapy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Taken along with an in vitro enzymatic detection, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of bacterial lipid A pools determined that the ICR-Mo enzyme might exploit a possible "ping-pong" mechanism to accept the phosphoethanolamine (PEA) moiety from its donor phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and then transfer it to the 1(or 4')-phosphate position of lipid A via an ICR-Mo-bound PEA adduct. Structural decoration of LPS-lipid A by ICR-Mo renders the recipient strain of E. coli resistant to polymyxin. Domain swapping assays indicate that the two domains of ICR-Mo cannot be functionally-exchanged with its counterparts in MCR-1/2 and EptA, validating its phylogenetic position in a distinct set of MCR-like genes. Structure-guided functional mapping of ICR-Mo reveals a PE lipid substrate recognizing cavity having a role in enzymatic catalysis and the resultant conference of antibiotic resistance. Expression of icr-Mo in E. coli significantly prevents the formation of reactive  species (ROS) induced by colistin. Taken together, our results define a member of a group of intrinsic colistin resistance genes phylogenetically close to the MCR-1/2 family, highlighting the evolution of transferable colistin resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875635>Sustained elevation of cerebrospinal fluid glucose and lactate after a single seizure does not parallel with mitochondria energy production.</a></h1><p>Generalized seizures trigger excessive neuronal firing that imposes large demands on the brain glucose/lactate availability and utilization, which synchronization requires an integral mitochondrial oxidative capability. We investigated whether a single convulsive crisis affects brain glucose/lactate availability and mitochondrial energy production. Adult male Wistar rats received a single injection of pentylentetrazol (PTZ, 60 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of glucose and lactate, mitochondrial respirometry, [C]-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake, glycogen content and cell viability in hippocampus were measured. CSF levels of glucose and lactate (mean ± SD) in control animals were 68.08 ± 11.62 mg/dL and 1.17 ± 0.32 mmol/L, respectively. Tonic-clonic seizures increased glucose levels at 10 min (96.25 ± 13.19) peaking at 60 min (113.03 ± 16.34) returning to control levels at 24 h (50.12 ± 12.81), while lactate increased at 10 min (3.23 ± 1.57) but returned to control levels at 360 min after seizures (1.58 ± 0.21). The hippocampal [C]-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake, glycogen content, and cell viability decreased up to 60 min after the seizures onset. Also, an uncoupling between mitochondrial  consumption and ATP synthesis via FoF1-ATP synthase was observed at 10 min, 60 min and 24 h after seizures. In summary, after a convulsive seizure glucose and lactate levels immediately rise within the brain, however, considering the acute impact of this metabolic crisis, mitochondria are not able to increase energy production thereby affecting cell viability.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The beta-2 adrenergic receptor (βAR) agonist formoterol induces mitochondrial biogenesis (MB), but other βAR agonists, such as clenbuterol, do not. We sought to identify the MB signaling pathway of formoterol and the differences in signaling between these two ligands that result in the differential induction of MB. While formoterol and clenbuterol increased cAMP, only formoterol increased the phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream target eNOS. The increase in Akt phosphorylation was Gβγ- and PI3K-dependent, and the increase in eNOS phosphorylation was Gβγ- and Akt-dependent. Only formoterol increased cGMP. Formoterol induced MB as measured by increases in uncoupled cellular respiration and PGC-1α and NDUFS1 mRNA expression and was blocked by inhibitors of Gβγ, Akt, NOS, and soluble guanylate cyclase. To identify distinct receptor-ligand interactions leading to these differences in signaling, we docked formoterol and clenbuterol to six structures of the βAR. Compared to clenbuterol, the methoxyphenyl group of formoterol interacted more frequently with V114 and F193, while its formamide group interacted more frequently with C191. These data indicate that the unique structural features of formoterol allow it to interact with the βAR to activate the Gβγ-Akt-eNOS-sGC pathway to induce MB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29262407>The Role of β-Adrenergic Overstimulation in the Early Stages of Renal Injury.</a></h1><p>To assess the possible contribution of the β-adrenergic overstimulation in early stages of renal injury, the present study evaluated, in rats, the effects of the β-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol (ISO) on renal function and morphology, as well as the renal mRNA and protein expression of the NADPH oxidase isoform 4 (Nox 4) and subunit p22phox, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, pro-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components.Wistar rats received ISO (0.3 mg.kg-1.day-1 s.c.) or vehicle (control) for eight days. At the end of the treatment, food and water intake, urine output and body weight gain were evaluated and renal function studies were performed. Renal tissue was used for the morphological, quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical studies.ISO did not change metabolic parameters or urine output. However it induced a decrease in renal blood flow and an increase in the filtration fraction. These changes were accompanied by increased cortical mRNA and protein expression for the renal oxidative stress components including Nox 4 and p22phox; ER stress, pro-inflamatory, pro-apoptotic as well as RAS components. ISO also induced a significant increase in medullar renin protein expression.These findings support relevant information regarding the contribution of specific β-adrenergic hyperactivity in early stage of renal injury, indicating the reactive  species, ER stress and intrarenal RAS as important factors in this process.© 2017 The Author(s).

We determined whether catecholamines suppress oxidative metabolism in β-cells through adrenergic receptors. In Min6 cells and isolated rat islets, epinephrine decreased  consumption rates compared to vehicle control or co-administration of epinephrine with α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine. Epinephrine also decreased forskolin-stimulated  consumption rates, indicating cAMP dependent and independent actions. Furthermore, glucose oxidation rates were decreased with epinephrine, independent of the exocytosis of insulin, which was blocked with yohimbine. We evaluated metabolic targets through proteomic analysis after 4 h epinephrine exposure that revealed 466 differentially expressed proteins that were significantly enriched for processes including oxidative metabolism, protein turnover, exocytosis, and cell proliferation. These results demonstrate that acute α2-adrenergic stimulation suppresses glucose oxidation in β-cells independent of nutrient availability and insulin exocytosis, while cAMP concentrations are elevated. Proteomics and immunoblots revealed changes in electron transport chain proteins that were correlated with lower metabolic reducing equivalents, intracellular ATP concentrations, and altered mitochondrial membrane potential implicating a new role for adrenergic control of mitochondrial function and ultimately insulin secretion.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Adenosine and A receptor (A2AR) agonism activate BAT in rodents, and endogenous adenosine is released locally in BAT as a by-product of noradrenaline, but physiological data from humans is lacking. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of exogenous adenosine on human BAT perfusion, and to determine the density of A2ARs in human BAT in vivo for the first time, using PET/CT imaging.Healthy, lean men (n = 10) participated in PET/CT imaging with two radioligands. Perfusion of BAT, white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscle was quantified with [O]HO at baseline, during cold exposure and during intravenous administration of adenosine. A2AR density of the tissues was quantified with [C]TMSX at baseline and during cold exposure.Adenosine increased the perfusion of BAT even more than cold exposure (baseline 8.3 ± 4.5, cold 19.6 ± 9.3, adenosine 28.6 ± 7.9 ml/100 g/min, p < 0.01). Distribution volume of [C]TMSX in BAT was significantly lower during cold exposure compared to baseline. In cold, low [C]TMSX binding coincided with high concentrations of noradrenaline.Adenosine administration caused a maximal perfusion effect in human supraclavicular BAT, indicating increased oxidative metabolism. Cold exposure increased noradrenaline concentrations and decreased the density of A2AR available for radioligand binding in BAT, suggesting augmented release of endogenous adenosine. Our results show that adenosine and A2AR are relevant for activation of human BAT, and A2AR provides a future target for enhancing BAT metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29668082>Altered stress hormone response following acute exercise during prostate cancer treatment.</a></h1><p>Exercise training reduces the side effects of cancer treatments; however, the stress hormone response to acute exercise during prostate cancer (PCa) treatment is unclear. The study purpose was to examine the effects of acute exercise on circulating cortisol, epinephrine (Epi), and norepinephrine (NE) concentrations during PCa treatment with and without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Men with PCa (n = 11), with PCa on ADT (n = 11), and with non-cancer controls (n = 8) had blood samples for stress hormones collected before and immediately (0 hour), 2 hours, and 24 hours after 45 minutes of intermittent cycling at 60% of peak wattage. NE increased by 385% (P < .001) at 0 hour and remained elevated at 2 hours (P < .05) with no group differences. Overall, cortisol significantly increased at 0 hour (36%, P < .012) and then significantly decreased below baseline at 2 hours (-24%, P < .001) before returning to resting levels at 24 hours. Cortisol levels during ADT were 32% lower than PCa (P = .006) with no differences vs controls. Epi increased immediately after exercise more in controls (817%, P < .001) than with ADT (700%) and PCa (333%) patients, and both cancer groups' absolute levels were attenuated relative to controls (ADT: -54%, PCa: -52%, P = .004). Compared with age-matched controls, PCa and ADT patients exhibited similar stress hormone responses with acute exercise for NE and cortisol but an attenuated EPI response that suggests altered adrenal function. Future studies should examine the physical stress of multiple exercise bouts to verify these findings and to explore the functional hormonal effects, such as immune and metabolic responses, during cancer treatment.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Yet, the relationship between vasopressors and the degree of cerebral microcirculatory support achieved remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the changes in cerebral and peripheral regional tissue  saturation (rSO2) as well as blood pressure (BP) before and after vasopressor infusion in patients with aSAH.Continuous noninvasive cerebral and peripheral rSO2 was obtained using near-infrared spectroscopy for up to 14 days after aSAH. Within-subject differences in rSO2 before and after the commencement of vasopressor infusion were analyzed controlling for Hunt and Hess grade and vasospasm.Of 45 patients with continuous rSO2 monitoring, 19 (42%) received vasopressor infusion (all 19 on norepinephrine, plus epinephrine in 2 patients, phenylephrine in 4 patients, and vasopressin in 2 patients). In these 19 patients, their vasopressor infusion times were associated with higher BP (systolic [b = 15.1], diastolic [b = 7.3], and mean [b = 10.1]; P = .001) but lower cerebral rSO2 (left cerebral rSO2 decreased by 4.4% [b = -4.4, P < .0001]; right cerebral rSO2 decreased by 5.5% [b = -5.5, P = .0002]).Despite elevation in systemic BP during vasopressor infusion times, cerebral rSO2 was concurrently diminished.

Crystallographic analysis revealed that 1-4 are based on the tetranuclear core {CuMn(μ-O)} where the metal centres are joined by the  bridges of Schiff base ligands forming a cube-like arrangement. The novel heterometallic compound [CuMn(L)(CHOH)][Mn(NCS)]·2CHOH (5) has been obtained by the "building block" approach using the reaction of [Cu(HL)] with manganese acetate and NHNCS in methanol. The crystal structure of 5 revealed the {CuMn(μ-O)(μ-O)} metal core which can be viewed as a double open cube. In spite of a similar {CuMnO} atom set in the cores of 1-5, the complexes show rather different molecular structures and significantly differ by the number and combinations of coordinated CHOH/HO solvent molecules.

However, antioxidant therapies targeting oxidative stress in the progression of those diseases have largely been unsuccessful. The current study evaluated the effects of a NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin (Apo), on the production of reactive  species and the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy under sustained β-adrenergic stimulation in male Wistar rats. As evident from the HW/BW ratio, HW/TL ratio, echocardiography, and histopathology, hypertrophic responses induced by isoproterenol (Iso; 5 mg/Kg body weight, subcutaneous) were blocked by Apo (10 mg/Kg body weight, intraperitoneal). Iso treatment increased the transcript levels of cybb and p22-phox, the two subunits of Nox. Iso treatment also caused a decrease in reduced glutathione level that was restored by Apo. Increase in mRNA levels of a number of markers of hypertrophy, viz., ANP, BNP, β-MHC, and ACTA-1 by Iso was either partially or completely prevented by Apo. Activation of key signaling kinases such as PKA, Erk, and Akt by Iso was also prevented by Apo treatment. Our study thus provided hemodynamic, biochemical, and molecular evidences supporting the therapeutic value of Apo in ameliorating adrenergic stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29118201>Inflow of  and glucose in brain tissue induced by intravenous norepinephrine: relationships with central metabolic and peripheral vascular responses.</a></h1><p>As an essential part of sympathetic activation that prepares the organism for "fight or flight," peripheral norepinephrine (NE) plays an important role in regulating cardiac activity and the tone of blood vessels, increasing blood flow to the heart and the brain and decreasing blood flow to the organs not as necessary for immediate survival. To assess whether this effect is applicable to the brain, we used high-speed amperometry to measure the changes in nucleus accumbens (NAc) levels of  and glucose induced by intravenous injections of NE in awake freely moving rats. We found that NE at low doses (2-18 μg/kg) induces correlative increases in NAc  and glucose, suggesting local vasodilation and enhanced entry of these substances in brain tissue from the arterial blood. By using temperature recordings from the NAc, temporal muscle, and skin, we show that this central effect is associated with strong skin vasoconstriction and phasic increases in intrabrain heat production, indicative of metabolic neural activation. A tight direct correlation between NE-induced changes in metabolic activity and NAc levels of  and glucose levels suggests that local cerebral vasodilation is triggered via a neurovascular coupling mechanism. Our data suggest that NE, by changing vascular tone and cardiac activity, triggers a visceral sensory signal that rapidly reaches the central nervous system via sensory nerves and induces neural activation. This neural activation leads to a chain of neurovascular events that promote entry of  and glucose in brain tissue, thus preventing any possible metabolic deficit during functional activation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Using high-speed amperometry and thermorecording in freely moving rats, we demonstrate that intravenous norepinephrine at physiological doses induces rapid correlative increases in nucleus accumbens  and glucose levels coupled with increased intrabrain heat production. Although norepinephrine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, by changing cardiac activity and vascular tone, it creates a sensory signal that reaches the central nervous system via sensory nerves, induces neural activation, and triggers a chain of neurovascular events that promotes intrabrain entry of  and glucose.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30212344>INHALANT ANESTHETIC RECOVERY FOLLOWING INTRAMUSCULAR EPINEPHRINE IN THE LOGGERHEAD SEA TURTLE ( CARETTA CARETTA).</a></h1><p>Prolonged anesthetic recovery time is a common complication of chelonian inhalant anesthesia and may be exacerbated by right-to-left intracardiac shunting of blood. Epinephrine may decrease intracardiac shunting, which may shorten anesthetic recovery time. The study objective was to assess inhalant anesthetic recovery time following intramuscular epinephrine compared with saline in the loggerhead sea turtle ( Caretta caretta). With the use of a prospective, randomized, blinded, crossover design with a 1-wk washout period, six turtles were anesthetized with intravenous (IV) alfaxalone 3 mg/kg, orotracheally intubated, manually ventilated with 3.5% isoflurane inhalant in 100%  for 90 min, and administered either intramuscular (IM) epinephrine 0.1 mg/kg or IM saline 0.1 ml/kg. Isoflurane administration was immediately discontinued and turtles were manually ventilated with room air until extubation. Physiologic variables, sedation scores, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ET) and isoflurane (ET) concentrations, time to first movement, and time to extubation were recorded and two-time-point venous blood gas analyses performed. Data were compared with the use of paired t-tests and repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) ( P < 0.05). No morbidity, mortality, or adverse events occurred. ET and ET did not significantly change over time during the isoflurane delivery period ( P = 0.990). Mean time to first movement was significantly faster following epinephrine (69.24 ± 12.28 min) compared with saline (87.71 ± 27.05 min, P = 0.047). Although differences were not statistically significant ( P = 0.133), time to extubation was at least 30 min faster (31-123 min) in 4/6 turtles following epinephrine compared with saline.

Successful resuscitation from neonatal cardiac arrest requires the delivery of high-quality chest compression using the most effective vasopressor with the optimal dose, timing, and route of administration during CPR. Current neonatal resuscitation guidelines recommend administration of epinephrine once CPR has started at a dose of 0.01-0.03 mg/kg preferably given intravenously, with repeated doses every 3-5 min until return of spontaneous circulation.

Causal therapy included re-laparotomy, peritoneal lavage, and antimicrobial therapy. Sequential kidney biopsies were obtained for the assessment of the electron microscopic tubular injury (EMTI) score.Serum creatinine and urea were highest in the control group, and there were no differences between the intervention groups. Cumulative diuresis was significantly higher in the HA group [1.0 ml kg h (0.6; 1.2)] compared with control [0.7 ml kg h (0.6; 0.9), P<0.05]. Creatinine clearance was highest in the HA and crystalloid groups. Ultrastructural kidney damage was highest in the control group [EMTI score 7.8 (6.7; 9.0)] without differences between intervention groups. Survival was 100% in the colloid groups vs 90% (crystalloid) and 60% (control, all P<0.05).In an ovine model of septic shock, kidney function and cumulative diuresis were preserved in the 5% albumin and crystalloid resuscitation groups, whereas HES 130/0.4 6% resulted in diminished creatinine clearance. Differences in kidney function between resuscitation fluids could not be explained by differences in ultrastructural kidney damage.84-02.04.2011.A300.Copyright © 2018 British Journal of Anaesthesia.

In this study, we demonstrated that inflamed dysfunctional adipose tissue plays a crucial role in cholesterol-induced NMS. Control (C), high cholesterol (HC) and HC with 10% fructose in drinking water (HCF) diets were fed to Sprague-Dawley rats for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the body weights of the C- and HC-fed rats were comparable, but the weights of the HCF-fed rats were relatively low. Cholesterol caused metabolic problems such as high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia and hypoinsulinemia. The HCF-fed rats exhibited whole-body insulin resistance with low circulating high-density lipoprotein levels. Increases in the tumor necrosis factor α level in the plasma, the number of CD68+ macrophages and the free nuclear factor-κB level in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) resulted in local inflammation, which appeared as inflamed dysfunctional gWAT. Reduced superoxide dismutases (SODs) deteriorate natural antioxidant defense systems and induce reactive  species in gWAT. Dysregulation of plasma levels of catecholamine, adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin in cholesterol-induced inflamed adipose tissue contributed to increased lipolysis and increased circulating nonesterified fatty acids. Cholesterol activated inflammation, lipolysis and cell death in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, Chol-3T3-CM reduced the population of M2-type Raw264.7 macrophages, indicating that the macrophage polarization is mediated by cholesterol.

Twenty four rats were randomly divided into four groups including control. They were treated with DPP extract (400mg/kg) and clopidogrel (0.2mg/kg) for 7days followed by myocardial injury induction using subcutaneous isoproterenol (100mg/kg) with an interval of 24h for two days (6th and 7th day). Administration of isoproterenol exhibited indicative changes in the ECG pattern evidenced by significant elevation of ST-segment and cardiac injury markers viz.; troponin-T, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by 315%, 71%, 64% and 170%, respectively as compared to control. Additionally, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in plasma was increased by 33% associated to histological myocardial necrosis. However, pre-co-treatment with DPP extract improved the cardiac biomarkers injury, normalized cardiac function indices and prevented the ventricular remodeling process through inhibition of ACE activity by 34% and the inhibition of the generation of radical  species. Extensive characterization of this DPP extract using LC-HRMS revealed numerous flavonoids and phenols compounds which could be endowed with cardiopreventive actions.

Oxidative damage is well known as a causative factor for pathogenic process in brain tissues. The aim of this study is to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of a 30% ethanol extract of Aquilariae Lignum (ALE) in repeated stress-induced hippocampal oxidative injury.Fifty BALB/c male mice (12 weeks old) were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10). For 11 consecutive days, each group was orally administered with distilled water, ALE (20 or 80 mg/kg) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC; 100 mg/kg), and then all mice (except unstressed group) were subjected to restraint stress for 6 h. On the final day, brain tissues and sera were isolated, and stress hormones and hippocampal oxidative alterations were examined. We also treated lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 μg/mL)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells with ALE (1 and 5 μg/mL) or NAC (10 μM) to investigate the pharmacological mechanism.Restraint stress considerably increased the serum levels of corticosterone and adrenaline and the hippocampal levels of reactive  species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and malondialdehyde (MDA). ALE administration significantly attenuated the above abnormalities. ALE also significantly normalized the stress-induced activation of astrocytes and microglial cells in the hippocampus as well as the elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). The in vitro assay outcome supplemented ALE could dramatically block NF-κB activation in microglia. The anti-oxidative stress effects of ALE were supported by the results of antioxidant components, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NFE2L2 (Nrf2) in the hippocampal tissues.We firstly demonstrated the neuroprotective potentials of A. Lignum against hippocampal oxidative injury in repeated restraint stress. The corresponding mechanisms might involve modulations in the release of ROS, pro-inflammatory cytokines and stress hormones.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28378467>Compared effects on cerebral oxygenation of ephedrine vs phenylephrine to treat hypotension during carotid endarterectomy.</a></h1><p>While both ephedrine and phenylephrine are currently used to treat hypotension occurring during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) under general anaesthesia, phenylephrine may have deleterious effects on the cerebral watershed, due to its exclusively vasoconstrictive action. In this controlled, double-blind randomised trial, we compared the effects of ephedrine and phenylephrine administered in a standardised algorithm to treat the first hypotensive event occurring since induction of anaesthesia until carotid cross-clamping. The algorithm consisted of 1-to-3 boluses of 6 mg of ephedrine or 50 μg of phenylephrine, after a goal-directed fluid therapy. In case of failure, the treatment switched to the other study drug. Cerebral tissue  saturation (SctO ) was monitored by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and the primary outcome was the restoring effect of SctO (ipsilateral to surgery) to baseline values. Secondary postoperative outcomes were: contralateral SctO , neurological outcomes, and plasma S100B protein measured at discharge from post-anaesthesia care unit. Ephedrine treatment provided a higher rate of restoration of ipsilateral SctO than phenylephrine (93.2% vs 85.1%, P=.034); this was also noted for contralateral SctO (93.5% vs 90.7%, P=.026). The gain in SctO on the lowest value during hypotension was also higher under ephedrine than phenylephrine (6.4% vs 4.3% ipsilateral, 5.1% vs 4% contralateral), but not significantly so. Clinical outcomes were unaffected by the treatment, but S100B protein plasma concentration was higher in the phenylephrine group. To conclude, this pilot trial, focusing on intermediate outcomes, suggests that ephedrine should be preferred to phenylephrine to treat hypotension during CEA.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28795283>Effects of epinephrine exposure on contractile performance of compact and spongy myocardium from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during hypoxia.</a></h1><p>Hypoxia results in elevated circulating epinephrine for many fish species, and this is likely important for maintaining cardiac function. The aims of this study were to assess how hypoxia impacts contractile responses of ventricular compact and spongy myocardium from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and to assess how and if epinephrine may protect myocardial performance from a depressive effect of hypoxia. Work output and maximum contraction rate of isolated preparations of spongy and compact ventricular myocardium from rainbow trout were measured. Tissues were exposed to the blood PO that they experience in vivo during environmental normoxia and hypoxia and also to low (5 nM) and high (500 nM) levels of epinephrine in 100% air saturation (PO 20.2 kPa) and during hypoxia (PO 2 kPa, 10% air saturation). It was hypothesized that hypoxia would result in a decrease in work output and maximum contraction rate in both tissue types, but that epinephrine exposure would mitigate the effect. Hypoxia resulted in a decline in net work output of both tissue types, but a decline in maximum contraction rate of only compact myocardium. Epinephrine restored the maximum contraction rate of compact myocardium in hypoxia, appeared to slightly enhance work output of only compact myocardium in air saturation but surprisingly not during hypoxia, and restored net work of hypoxic spongy myocardium toward normoxic levels. These results indicate hypoxia has a similar depressive effect on both layers of ventricular myocardium, but that high epinephrine may be important for maintaining inotropy in spongy myocardium and chronotropy in compact myocardium during hypoxia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29535165>Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein TXNDC5 Augments Myocardial Fibrosis by Facilitating Extracellular Matrix Protein Folding and Redox-Sensitive Cardiac Fibroblast Activation.</a></h1><p>Cardiac fibrosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) resulting from cardiac fibrosis impairs cardiac contractile function and increases arrhythmogenicity. Current treatment options for cardiac fibrosis, however, are limited, and there is a clear need to identify novel mediators of cardiac fibrosis to facilitate the development of better therapeutics. Exploiting coexpression gene network analysis on RNA sequencing data from failing human heart, we identified TXNDC5 (thioredoxin domain containing 5), a cardiac fibroblast (CF)-enriched endoplasmic reticulum protein, as a potential novel mediator of cardiac fibrosis, and we completed experiments to test this hypothesis directly.The objective of this study was to determine the functional role of TXNDC5 in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis.RNA sequencing and Western blot analyses revealed that TXNDC5 mRNA and protein were highly upregulated in failing human left ventricles and in hypertrophied/failing mouse left ventricle. In addition, cardiac TXNDC5 mRNA expression levels were positively correlated with those of transcripts encoding transforming growth factor β1 and ECM proteins in vivo. TXNDC5 mRNA and protein were increased in human CF (hCF) under transforming growth factor β1 stimulation in vitro. Knockdown of  attenuated transforming growth factor β1-induced hCF activation and ECM protein upregulation independent of SMAD3 (SMAD family member 3), whereas increasing expression of  triggered hCF activation and proliferation and increased ECM protein production. Further experiments showed that TXNDC5, a protein disulfide isomerase, facilitated ECM protein folding and that depletion of TXNDC5 led to ECM protein misfolding and degradation in CF. In addition, TXNDC5 promotes hCF activation and proliferation by enhancing c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity via increased reactive  species, derived from NAD(P)H oxidase 4. Transforming growth factor β1-induced TXNDC5 upregulation in hCF was dependent on endoplasmic reticulum stress and activating transcription factor 6-mediated transcriptional control. Targeted disruption of  in mice () revealed protective effects against isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy, reduced fibrosis (by ≈70%), and markedly improved left ventricle function; post-isoproterenol left ventricular ejection fraction was 59.1±1.5 versus 40.1±2.5 (<0.001) in  versus wild-type mice, respectively.The endoplasmic reticulum protein TXNDC5 promotes cardiac fibrosis by facilitating ECM protein folding and CF activation via redox-sensitive c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling. Loss of TXNDC5 protects against β agonist-induced cardiac fibrosis and contractile dysfunction. Targeting TXNDC5, therefore, could be a powerful new therapeutic approach to mitigate excessive cardiac fibrosis, thereby improving cardiac function and outcomes in patients with heart failure.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30482719>A prospective observational study of the change in regional cerebral  saturation during cesarean delivery in women receiving phenylephrine prophylaxis for spinal hypotension.</a></h1><p>Spinal hypotension causes decreased regional cerebral  saturation (ScO) in women undergoing cesarean delivery. In this study we aimed to measure the change in ScO using near infrared spectroscopy in women receiving a prophylactic phenylephrine infusion during cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia.This was a prospective, observational cohort study. Fifty-three women had ScO measurements at the following time points: preoperatively, in the supine position with 30° of left lateral tilt; one and five minutes after spinal anesthesia; at the time of skin incision; immediately after delivery; one minute after commencing the oxytocin infusion; at completion of surgery, and one hour after surgery. Spinal anesthesia and a prophylactic phenylephrine infusion were administered according to a standard treatment protocol. Statistical analysis used the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test with Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons.Blood pressure was maintained within 20% of baseline throughout surgery. The baseline mean (range) ScO was 61.5% (54.0-66.3%). It decreased significantly at all subsequent measurement points. The maximum decrease was five minutes after spinal anesthesia. Thirty-four (64.2%) of the parturients exhibited ScO values <20% of baseline, or a decrease to below an absolute value of 50%. There was no significant correlation between systolic blood pressure and mean ScO.Spinal anesthesia with phenylephrine infusion during cesarean delivery is associated with a significant decrease in ScO levels, maximal five minutes later. Further studies are required to establish the clinical significance of this finding.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the effect of free radicals on CGRP-mediated vasodilation remains unclear. The aim of this work was to study the effect of free radicals on CGRP-mediated neurogenic vasodilation on preparations of an isolated rabbit lingual artery. The experiments were performed on the lingual artery preparations of 6 rabbits of the Chinchilla breed of both sexes. The contractile-relaxation activity of isolated preparations, both with intact endothelial layer and deendotelized, were studied in isometric mode on a strain-gauge unit using mechanotrons of the 6 MX1C type. Our experiments showed that free radicals can disrupt the reactivity of the vascular wall both in the presence and in the absence of endothelium-dependent relaxation factors and that is might be considered as a main conclusion of this study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29033246>Effect of choline chloride premedication on xylazine-induced hypoxaemia in sheep.</a></h1><p>To determine the anti-inflammatory efficacy of choline in vivo and in vitro and to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of choline.Randomized, controlled studies.In vivo trials used 16 Romney sheep. In vitro experiments utilized RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cells.Hypoxaemia induced in 16 sheep by intravenous (IV) injection of 50 μg kg xylazine, an α-2 agonist, was measured in sheep at 0, 1 and 4 minutes using arterial blood gas analysis with and without 50 mg kg IV choline chloride premedication. Cell culture studies used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α) from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated macrophages with and without choline chloride premedication. TNF-α release was compared to thalidomide suppressed and untreated cells.Choline premedication in sheep mitigated a reduction in arterial partial pressure of  (PaO) but did not prevent development of clinically significant hypoxaemia. Decrease in mean PaO of choline treated sheep was 6.36 kPa (47.7 mmHg) compared to 9.81 kPa (73.6 mmHg) in control sheep. In vitro studies demonstrate that choline administered concurrent with LPS activation did not significantly suppress TNF-α expression but that treatment of cells with choline 10 minutes prior to LPS activation did significantly suppress TNF-α expression. Choline pretreated cells expressed 23.99 ± 4.52 ng mg TNF-α while LPS only control cells expressed 33.83 ± 3.20 ng mg.Choline is able to prevent macrophage activation in vitro when administered prior to LPS activation and may reduce hypoxaemia in sheep developing pulmonary oedema after xylazine administration. This effect requires premedication with choline.Pharmacological manipulation of autonomic inflammatory responses holds promise for the treatment of inflammation. However, the complex cellular mechanisms involved in this reflex means that an adequate therapy should approach multiple pathways and mechanisms of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2017 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia.

Because hypoxemia causes vascular dysregulation that further restricts  availability to tissue, it can be pharmacologically addressed. We hypothesized that theophylline can be safely combined with the β2-adrenergic vasodilator bambuterol to improve  availability in hypoxemic patients. Ergogenicity and hemodynamic effects of bambuterol and theophylline were measured in rats under hypobaric and normobaric hypoxia (12% O). Feasibility in humans was assessed using randomized, double-blind testing of the influence of combined slow-release theophylline (300 mg) and bambuterol (20 mg) on adverse events (AEs), plasma K, pulse, blood pressure, and drug interaction. Both drugs and their combination significantly improved hypoxic endurance in rats. In humans, common AEs were low K (<3.5 mmol/L; bambuterol: 12, theophylline: 4, combination: 13 episodes) and tremors (10, 0, 14 episodes). No exacerbation or serious AE occurred when drugs were combined. A drop in plasma K coincided with peak bambuterol plasma concentrations. Bambuterol increased heart rate by approximately 13 bpm. Drug interaction was present but small. We report promise, feasibility, and relative safety of combined theophylline and bambuterol as a treatment of hypoxemia in humans.

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate FNDC5 expression and the functional significance of irisn in skeletal muscle remain unknown. In this study, we explored the potential pathways that induce FNDC5 expression and delineated the metabolic effects of irisin on skeletal muscle.C2C12 myotubes were treated with drugs at various concentrations and durations. The expression and activation of genes were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Oxidative phosphorylation was quantified by measuring the  consumption rate (OCR).We found that the exercise-mimicking treatment (cAMP, forskolin and isoproterenol) increased Fndc5 expression in C2C12 myotubes. CREB over-expressed C2C12 myotubes displayed higher Fndc5 expression. CREB over-expression also promoted peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) expression. PGC-1α-induced Fndc5 expression was blocked when the dominant negative form of CREB (S133A) was present. PGC-1α mutation (S570A) also decreased Fndc5 expression. Immunoprecipitation showed that overexpressed PGC-1α complexed with CREB in HEK293 cells. C2C12 myotubes treated with forskolin also increased endogenous CREB and PGC-1α binding. Functionally, irisin treatment increased mitochondrial respiration, enhanced ATP production, promoted fatty acid oxidation but decreased glycolysis in myotubes.Our observation indicates that cAMP-mediated PGC-1α/CREB interaction triggers Fndc5 expression, which acts as an autocrine/paracrine to shape the metabolic phenotype of myotubes.© 2018 The Author(s).

We found that losartan does not cause renal cortical hypoxia after hemorrhage in rats because of decreased renal vascular resistance, but we did not evaluate resuscitation. We aimed to study losartan's effect on renal cortical and medullary oxygenation, as well as norepinephrine's vasopressor effect in a model of resuscitated hemorrhage. After 7 days of losartan (60 mg·kg·day) or control treatment, male Wistar rats were hemorrhaged 20% of their blood volume and resuscitated with Ringer's acetate. Mean arterial pressure, renal blood flow, and kidney tissue oxygenation were measured at baseline and after resuscitation. Finally, the effect of norepinephrine on mean arterial pressure and renal blood flow was investigated. As expected, losartan lowered mean arterial pressure but not renal blood flow. Losartan did not affect renal  consumption and  tension. Mean arterial pressure and renal blood flow were lower after resuscitated hemorrhage. A smaller increase of renal vascular resistance in the losartan group translated to a smaller decrease in cortical  tension, but no significant difference was seen in medullary  tension, either between groups or after hemorrhage. The effect of norepinephrine on mean arterial pressure and renal blood flow was similar in control- and losartan-treated rats. Losartan does not decrease renal oxygenation after resuscitated hemorrhage because of a smaller increase in renal vascular resistance. Further, losartan does not decrease the efficiency of norepinephrine as a vasopressor, indicating that blood pressure may be managed effectively during losartan treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30131296>The effect of inhaled salbutamol on the outcomes of transient tachypnea of the newborn.</a></h1><p>Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a self-limiting disease that results from a reduction in the rate of lung fluid clearance in neonates. A delay in lung fluid absorption in neonates disrupts the transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life. Use of beta-adrenergic antagonists, such as salbutamol, accelerates lung fluid clearance. The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of inhaled salbutamol on the clinical progression of TTN treatment.In the current triple-blind clinical trial, a total of 148 inpatients diagnosed with TTN were randomly divided into 2 groups. The treatment group (n = 74) received inhaled salbutamol and the placebo group (n = 74) received inhaled normal saline. The drug administration was started 6 h after birth and continued in the case of continued respiratory distress and the need for  as adjuvant therapy for up to 72 h maximum after the initiation of treatment. To evaluate the response to treatment with inhaled salbutamol, we assessed the respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), fraction of inspired  (FIO2) level, and O saturation at intervals of 30 min as well as 1 h and 4 h after drug administration. The results were compared between the groups.The results of the current study indicated a significant difference between the treatment and placebo groups in the treatment duration, hospitalization duration, need for continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP), and time of oral feeding initiation. In addition, no complication was observed during the treatment. It is noteworthy that, following the improvement of disease symptoms and reduction of hospitalization. This reduction may decrease the treatment costs and anxiety of parents, which was associated with proper mental and economic outcomes.Although, in the current study, drug administration was continued for 72 h maximum, the prescription of at most 4 doses of salbutamol may have had maximum efficiency in the remediation process.

One of the intuitively logical theories is that BR works through altering breathing pattern. There is currently no evidence, however, that BR does result in measurable changes in breathing pattern. In this case report we describe the effects of physiotherapy BR on a 57-year-old female with a 10-year history of asthma. Data were collected before and after a physiotherapy BR program comprising three sessions over 18 weeks: breathing pattern (respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP); physiology (end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO), heart rate,  saturations, spirometric lung function); questionnaires (Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score, Nijmegen Questionnaire); and medication usage. After BR, the patient's symptoms improved. Her physiology was largely unchanged, although her FEV increased by 0.12L, peak flow by 21L/min. The patient reported using less Salbutamol, yet her asthma control improved (ACQ down 1.5). Her Nijmegen score dropped from positive to negative for hyperventilation (from 39 to 7). Her anxiety-depression levels both reduced into 'normal' ranges. The patient's expiratory time increased, with longer respiratory cycles and slower respiratory rate.

In these cells, chemotaxis and reactive  species (ROS) production are reduced by the use of Na/H exchanger (NHE-1) inhibitors, but these results are mainly obtained using amiloride, a non-selective NHE-1 inhibitor. In bovine PMNs, the role of NHE-1 in functional responses has not been confirmed yet. The aim of this study was to determine the role of NHE-1 using amiloride and zoniporide in pH regulation, ROS production, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) release and calcium flux in bovine PMNs induced by the platelet activation factor (PAF), additionally we evaluated the presence of NHE-1 and NHE-2 mRNA Our data show the presence only of NHE-1 but not NHE-2 in bovine PMNs. Amiloride or zoniporide inhibited the intracellular alkalization induced by PAF without affecting calcium flux. Amiloride diminished ROS production and MMP-9 release, while zoniporide enhanced ROS production without change the MMP-9 release induced by PAF. Our work led us to conclude that changes in intracellular pH induced by PAF are regulated by NHE-1 in bovine neutrophils, but the effects of amiloride on ROS production and MMP-9 release induced by PAF are not NHE-1 dependent.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, we set out to determine the possible mechanisms that lead to muscle tremors and ascertain whether cardiorespiratory supportive interventions affect tremor intensity. We studied tremors and physiological responses during etorphine-azaperone immobilisation in eight boma-held and 14 free-living white rhinoceroses. Repeated measures analysis of variance and a Friedman test were used to determine differences in variables over time and between interventions. Spearman and Pearson correlations were used to test for associations between variables. Tremor intensity measured objectively by activity loggers correlated well (p &lt; 0.0001; r2 = 0.9) with visual observations. Tremor intensity was greatest when animals were severely hypoxaemic and acidaemic. Tremor intensity correlated strongly and negatively with partial pressure of  (PaO2 ) (p = 0.0003; r2 = 0.9995) and potential of hydrogen (pH) (p = 0.02, r2 = 0.97). It correlated strongly and positively with adrenaline concentrations (p = 0.003; r2 = 0.96), and adrenaline correlated strongly and negatively with PaO2 (p = 0.03; r2 = 0.95) and pH (p = 0.03; r2 = 0.94). Therefore, hypoxaemia and acidaemia were likely associated with the intensity of tremors through their activation of the release of tremorgenic levels of adrenaline. Tremors can be reduced if circulating adrenaline is reduced, and this can be achieved by the administration of butorphanol plus  insufflation. Furthermore, to assist with reducing the risks associated with rhinoceros immobilisation, tremor intensity could be used as a clinical indicator of respiratory and metabolic compromise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29450932>Cardiorespiratory noise correction improves the ASL signal.</a></h1><p>Cardiorespiratory fluctuations such as changes in heart rate or respiration volume influence the temporal dynamics of cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements during arterial spin labeling (ASL) fMRI. This "physiological noise" can confound estimates of resting state network activity, and it may lower the signal-to-noise ratio of ASL during task-related experiments. In this study we examined several methods for minimizing the contributions of both synchronized and non-synchronized physiological noise in ASL measures of CBF, by combining the RETROICOR approach with different linear deconvolution models. We evaluated the amount of variance in CBF that could be explained by each method during physiological rest, in both resting state and task performance conditions. To further demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we induced low-frequency cardiorespiratory deviations via peripheral adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol, and determined how these fluctuations influenced CBF, before and after applying noise correction. By suppressing physiological noise, we observed substantial improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio at the individual and group activation levels. Our results suggest that variations in cardiac and respiratory parameters can account for a large proportion of the variance in resting and task-based CBF, and indicate that regressing out these non-neuronal signal variations improves the intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio of ASL. This approach may help to better identify and control physiologically driven activations in ASL resting state and task-based analyses.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29962474>[Dapagliflozin, a Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter-2 Inhibitor, Acutely Reduces Energy Expenditure in Brown Adipose Tissue via Neural Signals in Mice].</a></h1><p>　Selective sodium glucose transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) treatment promotes urinary glucose excretion, thereby reducing blood glucose as well as body weight. However, only limited body weight reductions are achieved with SGLT2i administration. Hyperphagia is reportedly one of the causes of this limited weight loss. However, the effects of SGLT2i on systemic energy expenditure have not been fully elucidated. We investigated the acute effects of dapagliflozin, an SGLT2i, on systemic energy expenditure in mice. Eighteen hours after dapagliflozin administration,  consumption and brown adipose tissue (BAT) expression of ucp1, a thermogenesis-related gene, were significantly decreased as compared with those after vehicle administration. In addition, dapagliflozin significantly suppressed norepinephrine (NE) turnover in BAT and c-fos expression in the rostral raphe pallidus nucleus (rRPa), which contains the sympathetic premotor neurons responsible for thermogenesis. These findings indicate that the dapagliflozin-mediated acute decrease in energy expenditure involves a reduction in BAT thermogenesis via decreased sympathetic nerve activity from the rRPa. Furthermore, common hepatic branch vagotomy abolished the reductions in ucp1 expression, NE contents in BAT, and c-fos expression in the rRPa. In addition, alterations in hepatic carbohydrate metabolism, such as decreases in glycogen contents and upregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, occurred prior to the suppression of BAT thermogenesis, e.g., 6 h after dapagliflozin treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that SGLT2i acutely suppresses energy expenditure in BAT via regulation of an interorgan neural network consisting of the common hepatic vagal branch and sympathetic nerves.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30482720>Prophylactic infusion of phenylephrine is effective in attenuating the decrease in regional cerebral blood volume and oxygenation during spinal anesthesia for cesarean section.</a></h1><p>Hypotension induced by spinal anesthesia for cesarean section causes a decrease in maternal regional cerebral blood volume and oxygenation. We used near-infrared spectroscopy to determine whether prophylactic infusion of phenylephrine attenuates these decreases.Sixty patients undergoing bupivacaine spinal anesthesia for cesarean section were randomly divided into one of three intravenous infusion groups: saline (P0), phenylephrine 25 (P25) or 50 µg/min (P50). Mean arterial pressure, heart rate and near-infrared spectroscopy measurements were made at one-minute intervals for 20 minutes, and oxyhemoglobin, deoxy-hemoglobin and total-hemoglobin concentrations and tissue oxygenation index were determined. Mean changes in the values between baseline and each measurement time after intrathecal injection were compared.Significant decreases in mean arterial pressure were seen in group P0 compared to P25 and P50 (P <0.01). Heart rate decreased in a dose-dependent manner during phenylephrine infusion (P0 vs. P25 and P50, P25 vs. P50; P <0.05). Significantly higher total-hemoglobin levels were observed in the phenylephrine groups versus the P0 group (P <0.01). The largest decrease in tissue oxygenation index was found in the P50, followed by P0 and P25 groups (P0 vs. P25 and P50, P25 vs. P50; P <0.05).Prophylactic infusion of phenylephrine, especially at 25 µg/min, can effectively suppress decreases in regional cerebral blood volume and regional cerebral blood oxygenation after induction of spinal anesthesia for cesarean section.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Data were collected in the year before the index date and included comorbidities, medication use, COPD-related costs, health care resource use, and exacerbations.Of 5,311 eligible subjects, 2,057 initiated LAMA therapy (LAMA cohort) and 191 initiated LAMA+LABA therapy (LAMA+LABA cohort). The Charlson comorbidity index was slightly lower in the LAMA+LABA cohort than the LAMA cohort (mean±SD: 0.63±1.13 vs. 0.66±1.28), but the number of prescriptions was higher (mean±SD: 42.9±23.2 vs. 30.5±27.2). The LAMA+LABA cohort had higher short-acting inhaled β2 agonist (56.0% vs. 35.7%), oral corticosteroid (37.7% vs. 32.6%), and home  therapy use (14.1% vs. 3.2%) than the LAMA cohort. Total medical costs were greater in the LAMA+LABA cohort than the LAMA cohort (mean±SD: $3,320.40±4085.9 vs. $1,226.20±3602.9), although emergency department ($11.00±66.8 vs. $30.70±259.2) and outpatient visit ($39.60±163.1 vs. $41.70±424.3) costs were lower. Resource use and exacerbation incidence were similar between cohorts.In this first look, subjects with COPD initiating LAMA or LAMA+LABA therapy exhibited different clinical and resource use characteristics in the year before treatment. Subjects receiving LAMA+LABA were older, with higher COPD co-medication use, more prescriptions, and associated higher pharmacy costs compared with subjects initiating LAMA. These differences may reflect a higher severity of COPD in those starting LABA+LAMA treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29654295>Antihypertensive effect of etamicastat in dopamine D2 receptor-deficient mice.</a></h1><p>Abnormalities of the DR gene (DRD2) play a role in the pathogenesis of human essential hypertension; variants of the DRD2 have been reported to be associated with hypertension. Disruption of Drd2 (D) in mice increases blood pressure. The hypertension of D mice has been related, in part, to increased sympathetic activity, renal oxidative stress, and renal endothelin B receptor (ETBR) expression. We tested in D mice the effect of etamicastat, a reversible peripheral inhibitor of dopamine-β-hydroxylase that reduces the biosynthesis of norepinephrine from dopamine and decreases sympathetic nerve activity. Blood pressure was measured in anesthetized D mice treated with etamicastat by gavage, (10 mg/kg), conscious D mice, and D littermates, and mice with the DR selectively silenced in the kidney, treated with etamicastat in the drinking water (10 mg/kg per day). Tissue and urinary catecholamines and renal expression of selected G protein-coupled receptors, enzymes related to the production of reactive  species, and sodium transporters were also measured. Etamicastat decreased blood pressure both in anesthetized and conscious D mice and mice with renal-selective silencing of DR to levels similar or close to those measured in D littermates. Etamicastat decreased cardiac and renal norepinephrine and increased cardiac and urinary dopamine levels in D mice. It also normalized the increased renal protein expressions of ETBR, NADPH oxidase isoenzymes, and urinary 8-isoprostane, as well as renal NHE3 and NCC, and increased the renal expression of DR but not DR in D mice. In conclusion, etamicastat is effective in normalizing the increased blood pressure and some of the abnormal renal biochemical alterations of D mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28640644>Nebivolol alleviates aortic remodeling through eNOS upregulation and inhibition of oxidative stress in l-NAME-induced hypertensive rats.</a></h1><p>To investigate the effect and mechanism of nebivolol on aortic remodeling in N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME)-induced hypertension.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with equal volumes of drinking water or l-NAME (60 mg/kg/day), alone or in combination with nebivolol (8 mg/kg/day) or atenolol (80 mg/kg/day) by gavage for 8 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), aortic morphometry, plasma nitric oxide (NO) levels, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, and relaxation of aorta to acetylcholine were determined. Protein expression of endothelial NOS (eNOS), Akt, and NADPH oxidase (Nox) was evaluated.l-NAME-treated rats showed an elevated SBP associated with aortic remodeling. l-NAME-treated rats showed reduced plasma NO levels and NOS activity and increased reactive  species (ROS). Protein expression of eNOS, eNOS phosphorylated at Ser (p-eNOS), Akt, and Akt phosphorylated at Ser (p-Akt) decreased, whereas that of Nox2, Nox4, and p22 increased in the aortas from l-NAME-treated rats. Nebivolol treatment reduced SBP and ameliorated aortic remodeling. The effects of nebivolol were accompanied by increasing NO levels, NOS activity, and expression of eNOS, p-eNOS, Akt, and p-Akt, as well as reduction of ROS generation and Nox2, Nox4, and p22 expression. These effects of nebivolol were not reproduced by atenolol.Our data indicate a protective role of nebivolol on the high blood pressure and vascular remodeling induced by l-NAME. The beneficial vascular effect of nebivolol is mediated by the upregulation of eNOS and inhibition of oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29424292>Cross-linked hyaluronan films loaded with acetazolamide-cyclodextrin-triethanolamine complexes for glaucoma treatment.</a></h1><p>This work aimed to design and characterize cross-linked hyaluronic acid-itaconic acid films loaded with acetazolamide-hydroxypropyl β cyclodextrin-triethanolamine complexes.Films were cross-linked with itaconic acid and poly(ethyleneglycol)-diglycidylether.

A rat model of HF was induced in vivo by intraperitoneally administering ISO (5 mg/kg/day) for 7 days. After 4 weeks following establishment of the HF model, hemodynamic analysis demonstrated that ISO induced a significant increase in the left ventricular end‑diastolic pressure and a decrease in the left ventricular systolic pressure and maximum contraction velocity. The plasma levels of myocardial injury markers, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), CK‑muscle/brain which were determined using the corresponding assay kits and plasma brain natriuretic peptide which was detected by an ELISA kit, an important biomarker of HF, increased following ISO treatment. Furthermore, levels of GDF11 expression and protein, which were estimated using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and an ELISA kit in plasma and western blotting in the heart tissue, respectively, significantly increased following ISO treatment. To demonstrate the effects of ISO on GDF11 production in cardiomyocytes, H9C2 cells (a cardiomyoblast cell line derived from embryonic rat heart tissue) were treated with ISO (50 nM) for 24 h in vitro; it was revealed that GDF11 protein and mRNA expression levels significantly increased following ISO treatment. In addition, recombinant GDF11 (rGDF11) administered to ISO‑treated H9C2 cells resulted in decreased proliferation, which was detected via a CCK‑8 assay, and increased LDH levels and cell apoptosis of cells, which was determined using Caspase‑3 activity and Hoechst 33258 staining. Additionally, rGDF11 increased the levels of reactive  species and malondialdehyde due to the upregulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 (Nox4) following rGDF11 treatment. Conversely, GDF11 knockdown reduced ISO‑induced apoptosis by inhibiting oxidative stress injury. The results suggested that GDF11 production was upregulated in ISO‑induced rats with HF and in ISO‑treated H9C2 cells, and that rGDF11 treatment increased ISO‑induced oxidative stress injury by upregulating Nox4 in H9C2 cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28364698>N-Heterocyclic choline analogues based on 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro(iso)quinoline scaffold with anticancer and anti-infective dual action.</a></h1><p>Pharmacological effects of biologically active "small molecules" can be improved by their targeted modification, which affects drug delivery and interaction with tumor cells and microorganisms. We aimed to evaluate anticancer and antimicrobial activity of lipid-like choline derivatives modified via simultaneous introduction of tetrahydro(iso)quinoline based pharmacophore system at nitrogen atom and long chain alkyl substituent at  atom.Target compounds were synthesized under phase-transfer catalysis conditions followed by quaternization, and evaluated for cytotoxicity and NO-generation ability on HT-1080 and MG-22A tumor cell lines and NIH 3T3 normal mouse fibroblasts, and screened for antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis) and fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger). Inhibitory action of active compounds towards E. coli DNA gyrase was investigated.Target compounds exhibit high selective cytotoxicity (LC<1μg/mL) and NO-induction ability, and reveal strong antimicrobial activity with MIC and MBC/MFC values of 0.5-32μg/mL, predominantly vs. gram-positive bacteria and fungi. Tested substances displayed inhibitory effect towards E. coli DNA gyrase, though less than ciprofloxacin. Tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives and compounds possessing substituents with chain length of 10 and 11 carbon atoms have highest indices of activities.Lipid-like N-heterocyclic choline analogues based on 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro(iso)quinoline scaffold, possessing very high cytotoxicity with attendant strong antimicrobial activity are the leads for developing effective dual action therapeutics.Copyright © 2017 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Diazoxide effects on reactive  species (ROS) production and on the cAMP-response element binding (CREB) transcription factor's abundance in cardiomyocytes were also analyzed. ROS measurements used a fluorescent dye. Western blot analysis and quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction were used to measure phosphorylated form of CREB (pCREB) abundance and miR-132 expression, respectively.Isoproterenol (ISO) induced cardiac hypertrophy, an effect that was mitigated by diazoxide. The rate of ROS production, CREB phosphorylation, and miR-132 expression increased after the addition of ISO. H2O2 increased pCREB abundance and miR-132 expression; upregulation of miR-132 was blocked by the specific inhibitor of CREB transcription, 666-15. Consistent with a role of ROS on miR-132 expression, diazoxide prevented the increase in ROS production, miR-132 expression, and pCREB abundance produced by ISO. Phosphorylation of CREB by ISO was prevented by U0126, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase.Our data first demonstrate that diazoxide mitigates hypertrophy by preventing an increase in miR-132 expression. The mechanism likely involves less ROS production leading to less phosphorylation of CREB. Our data further show that ROS enhance miR-132 transcription, and that ISO effects are probably mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29492519>[Research advances on anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic biological effects of methane].</a></h1><p>Methane (CH) is the simplest hydrocarbons and endogenous CH has been thought only to be generated by methanogens in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract of the mammals.

We hypothesized that acute SAL intake would induce changes in cerebral responses during exercise, with significant improvement in cerebral oxygenation and voluntary activation (VA) contributing to an increase in muscle performance.Fourteen trained male subjects (25 ± 5 yr) performed repeated isometric knee extensions until task failure (TF) after 4 mg (oral) SAL, 800 μg (inhaled) SAL, or placebo intake. VA, corticospinal excitability, and inhibition assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation and changes in hemoglobin concentrations assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy were measured before and during the fatiguing task.SAL had no significant effect both at rest and during exercise on prefrontal cortex oxygenation (e.g., changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration at TF: 11.4 ± 11.1 (4 mg SAL) vs 10.4 ± 10.6 (800 μg SAL) vs 10.8 ± 8.1 μmol (placebo); P = 0.314) and neuromuscular function (e.g., VA measured by TMS at TF: 90.2% ± 6.6% vs 92.6% ± 5.0% vs 90.1% ± 7.0%; P = 0.760). SAL had no effect on the number of contractions until TF (95 ± 51 vs 100 ± 52 vs 93 ± 47; P = 0.629).These results indicate that acute SAL intake had no effect on central and peripheral mechanisms of neuromuscular fatigue and did not improve quadriceps endurance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29036266>Alterations in NO/ROS ratio and expression of Trx1 and Prdx2 in isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.</a></h1><p>The development of cardiac hypertrophy is a complicated process, which undergoes a transition from compensatory hypertrophy to heart failure, and the identification of new biomarkers and targets for this disease is greatly needed. Here we investigated the development of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy in an in vitro experimental model. After the induction of hypertrophy with ISO treatment in H9c2 cells, cell surface area, cell viability, cellular reactive  species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO) levels were tested. Our data showed that the cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, and NO/ROS balance varied during the development of cardiac hypertrophy in H9c2 cells. It was also found that the expression of thioredoxin1 (Trx1) and peroxiredoxin2 (Prdx2) was decreased during the cardiac hypertrophy of H9c2 cells. These results suggest a critical role for Trx1 and Prdx2 in the cardiac hypertrophy of H9c2 cells and in the transition from compensated hypertrophy to de-compensated hypertrophy in H9c2 cells, and our findings may have important implications for the management of this disease.© The Author 2017.

Astragaloside IV (AsIV) is a major active ingredient in Astragalus membranaceus. In a preliminary experiment, it was demonstrated that this naturally occurring substance exhibited cardioprotective effects via preventing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of AsIV on β‑adrenergic receptor (β‑AR)‑mediated cardiac fibrosis, and the associated mechanism. Cell Counting Kit‑8 (CCK‑8) assay was used to examine the proliferation of rat cardiac fibroblast (CF) cultures. Collagen I secretion was detected by ELISA. Dihydroethidium was used to determine intracellular ROS levels. Western blotting was used to examine the expression level of total and phosphorylated mitogen‑activated protein kinases (MAPKs). In the present study, the effects of AsIV on β‑adrenergic receptor (β‑AR) ‑mediated cardiac fibrosis were investigated, and the associated mechanism was revealed. Isoprenaline (ISO) is a selective β‑AR agonist, and treatment with AsIV significantly inhibited (ISO)‑triggered cardiac fibroblast proliferation and type I collagen synthesis. In addition, ISO resulted in a significant elevation of reactive  species (ROS) levels and phosphorylation of the three profibrotic MAPKs, namely extracellular signal‑regulated kinase, p38MAPK and c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase. AsIV effectively reversed the aforementioned ISO‑induced alterations. In addition, N‑acetylcysteine, a typical ROS scavenger, mimicked the inhibitory effects of AsIV on MAPK activation. The present study demonstrated that AsIV may inhibit ISO‑induced cardiac fibrosis by suppressing ROS‑mediated MAPK activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29635654>Acute Hypoxia Induces Enkephalin Production and Release in an Adrenergic Cell Line Model of Neonatal Chromaffin Cell Responses to Hypoxic Stress.</a></h1><p>Prior to maturation of the human sympathetic nervous system, the neonatal adrenal medulla senses and responds to hypoxia. In addition to catecholamine release, the adrenal medulla synthesizes and stores opioid peptides, notably enkephalin (ENK). However, it is not known whether acute hypoxia evokes adrenal ENK production and release, as seen in the central nervous system (CNS). We hypothesize that acute hypoxia stimulates synthesis and release of ENK in chromaffin cells.Cultures of adrenergic mouse pheochromocytoma cells (MPC) 10/9/96CR were incubated in 10%  (O) at intervals of up to 60 minutes. ENK content and release were measured by Met-ENK enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ENK messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Incubation of MPC 10/9 cells in 10% O evoked rapid release of epinephrine and of Met-ENK which increased approximately twofold in 15 minutes. Reduced [O] also induced an overall increase (14%) in cellular ENK peptide content within 60 minutes. Acute hypoxia-stimulated release of Met-ENK was accompanied by increased mRNA expression in MPC 10/9s, a cell culture model of adrenergic chromaffin cells.We speculate that the ability of reduced [O] to evoke ENK release from chromaffin cells may influence blood pressure regulation and heart contractility, thereby providing an adaptive survival advantage during neonatal asphyxia.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28935825>Effect of tapering after a period of high-volume sprint interval training on running performance and muscular adaptations in moderately trained runners.</a></h1><p>The effect of tapering following a period of high-volume sprint interval training (SIT) and a basic volume of aerobic training on performance and muscle adaptations in moderately trained runners was examined. Eleven (8 men, 3 women) runners [maximum  uptake (V̇o): 56.8 ± 2.9 ml·min·kg; mean ± SD] conducted high-volume SIT (HV; 20 SIT sessions; 8-12 × 30 s all-out) for 40 days followed by 18 days of tapering (TAP; 4 SIT sessions; 4 × 30 s all-out). Before and after HV as well as midway through and at the end of TAP, the subjects completed a 10-km running test and a repeated running test at 90% of vV̇o to exhaustion (RRT). In addition, a biopsy from the vastus lateralis muscle was obtained at rest. Performance during RRT was better ( P < 0.01) at the end of TAP than before HV (6.8 ± 0.5 vs. 5.6 ± 0.5 min; means ± SE), and 10-km performance was 2.7% better ( P < 0.05) midway through (40.7 ± 0.7 min) and at the end of (40.7 ± 0.6 min) TAP than after HV (41.8 ± 0.9 min). The expression of muscle Na-K-ATPase (NKA)α, NKAβ, phospholemman (FXYD1), and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase (SERCA1) increased ( P < 0.05) during HV and remained higher during TAP. In addition,  uptake at 60% of vV̇o was lower ( P < 0.05) at the end of TAP than before and after HV. Thus short-duration exercise capacity and running economy were better than before the HV period together with higher expression of muscle proteins related to Na/K transport and Ca reuptake, while 10-km performance was not significantly improved by the combination of HV and tapering. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Short-duration performance became better after 18 days of tapering from ~6 wk of high-volume sprint interval training (SIT), whereas 10-km performance was not significantly affected by the combination of high-volume SIT and tapering. Higher expression of muscle NKAα, NKAβ, FXYD1, and SERCA1 may reflect faster Na/K transport and Ca reuptake that could explain the better short-duration performance. These results suggest that the type of competition should determine the duration of tapering to optimize performance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28450188>Hydrogen sulfide attenuates cardiac injury in takotsubo cardiomyopathy by alleviating oxidative stress.</a></h1><p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is characterized by transient left ventricular apical ballooning with the absence of coronary occlusion, which is an acute cardiac syndrome with substantial morbidity and mortality. It was reported that reduced endogenous hydrogen sulfide (HS) levels may be related to various heart diseases. The present study investigated the mechanism by which HS administration modulates and protects cardiac function in TCM rats. In order to establish a TCM model, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were injected with a single dose of β-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (ISO). We found that ISO induced cardiac dysfunction, which was characterized by a significant decrease in left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), maximum contraction velocity (+dp/dtmax), maximum relaxation velocity (-dp/dtmax) and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Accordingly, we found that plasma and heart tissue HS levels in TCM rats decreased significantly, and cardiac cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) expression were lower. Moreover, cardiac dysfunction in TCM was associated with oxidative stress response and reactive  species (ROS) formation. NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX) and p67 protein expressions significantly increased in TCM cardiac tissues. In addition, Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) ameliorated ISO-induced cardiac dysfunction and reversed ISO-induced oxidative stress. This study revealed that HS exerted cardioprotective effects by reducing NADPH oxidase, which reduced ROS formation and prevented oxidative stress. Our study provided novel evidence that HS is protective in myocardial dysfunction in TCM rats and could be a therapeutic target for alleviating β-adrenergic system overstimulation-induced cardiovascular dysfunction.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study was to develop an inline DPI that is actuated using a low volume of air (LV-DPI) to efficiently deliver pharmaceutical aerosols during low flow nasal cannula (LFNC) therapy. A characteristic feature of the new inline LV-DPIs was the use of hollow capillary tubes that both pierced the capsule and provided a pathway for inlet air and exiting aerosol. Aerosolization characteristics, LFNC depositional losses and emitted dose (ED) were determined using 10 mg powder masses of a small-particle excipient enhanced growth (EEG) formulation. While increasing the number of inlet capillaries from one to three did not improve performance, retracting the inlet and outlet capillaries did improve ED by over 30%. It was theorized that high quality performance requires both high turbulent energy to deaggregate the powder and high wall shear stresses to minimize capsule retention. Best case performance included a device ED of approximately 85% (of loaded dose) and device emitted mass median aerodynamic diameter of 1.77 µm. Maximum ED through the LFNC system and small diameter (4 mm) nasal cannula was approximately 65% of the loaded dose. Potential applications of this device include the delivery of high dose inhaled medications such as surfactants, antibiotics, mucolytics, and anti-inflammatories.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Pre-clinical studies have shown benefit from salbutamol, possibly due speeding alveolar fluid clearance or reducing bronchoconstriction. In this small pilot dose-response study, we aimed to explore whether addition of nebulized salbutamol to standard care might improve resuscitation.We performed a single-blind phase II study comparing the effect of two different doses of nebulized salbutamol versus saline placebo, in addition to standard treatment. Primary outcome was  saturations over the first 60 min of resuscitation; secondary outcomes included heart rate, incidence of dysrhythmias, time to 'atropinization', atropine dose required, and mortality.Seventy-five patients were randomized to receive 5 mg (Salb5, n = 25) or 2.5mg (Salb2.5, n = 25) of salbutamol, or saline placebo (NoSalb, n = 25), by nebulizer.  saturations did not differ between groups over the first 60 min of resuscitation (median AUC NoSalb: 1376 [95% CI 1282 to 1470], Salb2.5: 1395 [1305 to 1486], Salb5: 1233 [1100 to 1367]; p = .9898). Heart rate was also similar across the three arms. Median time to full atropinization, and atropine dose required, were the same for all three arms (NoSalb 15.0 [10-16] min and 12.6 [8.0-13.4] mg, Salb2.5 15.0 [10-16] min and 12.6 [9.3-16.8] mg, and Salb5 15.0 [10-20] min and 12.6 [10.7-20.6] mg; p = .4805 and p = .1871, respectively). Three (12%) patients died in the Salb2.5 and Salb5 groups and two (8%) in the NoSalb group.This pilot study, within the limitations of its small size and variation between patients, found no apparent evidence that administration of nebulized salbutamol improved resuscitation of patients with acute OP insecticide self-poisoning.

Animal models studying the pathophysiological central nervous system alterations during the course of ALF provide an opportunity to improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The aim of this study was to analyse the course of cerebral oxygenation in addition to conventional neuromonitoring during the course of acetaminophen-induced ALF.ALF was induced by intrajejunal acetaminophen administration in 20 German landrace pigs. All animals underwent invasive hemodynamic and neuromonitoring and were maintained under standardized intensive care support. Neuromonitoring consisted of continuous intraparenchymatous recording of intracranial pressure and brain partial  pressure. Hemodynamic and ventilation parameters were continuously recorded; laboratory parameters were analysed every eight hours. Mean values were compared using the Wilcoxon test.Acute liver failure occurred in all intoxicated animals after 23±2h, resulting in death due to ALF after further 15±2h. Continuous neuromonitoring was performed in all animals during the whole experiment without observing signs of intracranial haemorrhage. Two hours after manifestation of ALF an increase in brain tissue  (PtiO2) was observed. Brain oxygenation stayed stable until nine hours before death. Intracranial pressure (ICP) remained basically at a plateau level until manifestation of ALF. In the following ten hours a linear and slow increase was observed until five hours before death, followed by a fast and continuous rise in ICP to a final level of 35±1mmHg. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) began to decrease 25h prior to exitus, further decreasing to 18±2mmHg at the end of the experiment. A strong negative linear correlation was found between PtiO2 and ICP (R=0.97). Arterial partial pressure of  (PaO2) below 100mmHg was associated with lower PtiO2 levels. Changes in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaC02) did not influence PtiO2 values. Hemoglobin values below 7g/dl were associated with lower PtiO2 values.The results of our experiments demonstrate that ICP and PtiO2 measurements indicate impending damage well before serious complications occur and their use should be considered in order to protect endangered brain function in the presence of acetaminophen-induced ALF.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that increasing heart rate during hypothermia would impair diastolic function. Human left ventricular trabeculae obtained from explanted hearts of patients with terminal heart failure were stimulated at 0.5 Hz, and contraction-relaxation cycles were recorded. Maximal developed force (F), maximal rate of development of force [(dF/d t)], time to peak force (TPF), time to 80% relaxation (TR80), and relaxation time (RT = TR80 - TPF) were measured at 37, 33, 31, and 29°C. At these temperatures, stimulation frequency was increased from 0.5 to 1.0 and to 1.5 Hz. At 1.5 Hz, concentration-response curves for the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) agonist isoproterenol were performed. F, TPF, and RT increased when temperature was lowered, whereas (dF/d t) decreased. At all temperatures, increasing stimulation frequency increased F and (dF/d t), whereas TPF and RT decreased. At 31 and 29°C, resting tension increased at 1.5 Hz, which was ameliorated by β-AR stimulation. At all temperatures, maximal β-AR stimulation increased F, (dF/d t), and maximal systolic force, whereas resting tension decreased progressively with lowering temperature. β-AR stimulation reduced TPF and RT to the same extent at all temperatures, despite the more elongated contraction-relaxation cycle at lower temperatures. Diastolic dysfunction during hypothermia results from an elongation of the contraction-relaxation cycle, which decreases the time for ventricular filling. Hypothermic bradycardia protects the heart from diastolic dysfunction and increasing the heart rate during hypothermia should be avoided. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Decreasing temperature increases the duration of the contraction-relaxation cycle in the human ventricular myocardium, significantly reducing the time for ventricular filling during diastole. During hypothermia, increasing heart rate further reduces the time for ventricular filling and in some situations increases resting tension further impairing diastolic function. Modest β-adrenergic receptor stimulation can ameliorate these potentially detrimental changes during diastole while improving contractile force generation during targeted temperature management.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31150630>Sulfated polysaccharides from the edible marine algae Padina tetrastromatica attenuates isoproterenol-induced oxidative damage via activation of PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway - An in vitro and in vivo approach.</a></h1><p>The reactive  species (ROS) induced oxidative stress is an inevitable factor for the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The edible marine algae-derived sulfated polysaccharides gained special attention as novel bioactive compounds having potential pharmacological activities. The present study evaluated in vitro and in vivo cardioprotective properties of sulfated polysaccharides from the edible brown marine algae Padina tetrastromatica (PSPS) against isoproterenol (ISO) induced cardiac damage. The cardioprotective properties of PSPS were first evaluated in H9c2 cardiac myoblasts and the results were confirmed by in vivo studies conducted in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The biochemical parameters, histopathological analysis, mRNA expressions, and ELISA studies indicated that PSPS significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the cardiac damage induced by ISO by reducing lipid peroxidation and improving antioxidant status, both in vitro and in vivo, via modulating PI3k/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway. The histopathological evidence further reinforced our findings and highlighted the promising cardioprotective activities offered by PSPS.Copyright © 2019.

G. verum extracts are characterized here using chromatography, where among the rich pool of phenolic acids of flavonoids two known anti-stress modulators, chlorogenic acid and rutin are identified in high quantities. Additionally, the extracts are characterized using a series of in vitro assays (EPR, DPPH, TPC and TEAC). Considering the chemical findings, the potential beneficial effects of the G. verum extract are explored here in a living organism exposed to stress induced oxidative damages. Thus, the biochemical-modulatory and antioxidant roles of two doses of G. verum extract are examined in animals exposed to acute restraint and dark stress (S). The animals were divided in groups [control, S, SG1 (exposed to 25 mg G. verum extract), SG2 (50 mg extract)]. Increased levels of lipid peroxidation (TBARS from 4.43 to 8.06 nmol/mL), corticosterone from 0.43 to 1.96 μg/dL and epinephrine from 44.43 to 126.7 μg/mL, as well as decreased antioxidant enzymes activities (SOD/CAT) were observed in the S group. The G. verum extract afforded a near-normal equilibrium within the biochemical parameters of animals exposed to RS, by reducing oxidative damage (TBARS at a 3.73 nmol/mL; CS at 0.90 μg/dL; EP at 63.72 μg/mL) and by restoring the antioxidant balance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30273351>Beta-adrenergic activation induces cardiac collapse by aggravating cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction in bupivacaine intoxication.</a></h1><p>In order to determine the role of the adrenergic system in bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity, a series of experiments were performed. In an animal experiment, male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats under chloral hydrate anesthesia received intravenous bupivacaine, followed by an intravenous injection of adrenalin or isoprenalin, and the electrocardiogram (ECG), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), the maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (+dP/dtmax) and the maximum rate of pressure decrease (-dP/dtmax) were continually monitored. In a cellular experiment, freshly isolated adult SD rat ventricular myocytes were perfused with bupivacaine at different concentrations in the presence or absence of isoprenalin, with or without esmolol. The percentage of the sarcomere shortening (bl% peak h), departure velocity (dep v) of sarcomere shortening and time to 50% of the peak speed of myocyte contraction (Tp50) was assessed by a video-based edge-detection system. In an additional experiment, Swiss mice pretreated with saline, isoprenalin, esmolol or dexmedetomidine received bupivacaine to determine the 50% lethal dose (LD50) of bupivacaine. Electron microscopy of myocardial mitochondria was performed to assess damage of these structures. To test mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS) production, freshly isolated SD rat ventricular myocytes were incubated with bupivacaine in the presence of isoprenalin, with or without esmolol. First, our results showed that bupivacaine significantly reduced the LVSP and +dP/dtmax, as well as enhanced the LVEDP and -dP/dtmax (P < 0.05, vs. control, and vs. baseline). Adrenalin and isoprenalin induced a further reduction of LVSP and +dP/dtmax (P < 0.05, vs. before adrenalin or isoprenalin delivery, and vs. control). Second, bupivacaine induced a dose-dependent cardiomyocyte contractile depression. While 5.9 μmol/L or 8.9 μmol/L of bupivacaine resulted in no change, 30.0 μmol/L of bupivacaine prolonged the Tp50 and reduced the bl% peak h and dep v (P < 0.05, vs. control and vs. baseline). Isoprenalin aggravated the bupivacaine-induced cardiomyocyte contractile depression, significantly prolonging the Tp50 (P < 0.05, vs. bupivacaine alone) and reducing the dep v (P < 0.05, vs. bupivacaine alone). Third, esmolol and dexmedetomidine significantly enhanced, while isoprenalin significantly reduced, the LD50 of bupivacaine in mice. Fourth, bupivacaine led to significant mitochondrial swelling, and the extent of myocardial mitochondrial swelling in isoprenalin-pretreated mice was significantly higher than that compared with mice pretreated with saline, as reflected by the higher mitochondrial damage score (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, esmolol pretreatment significantly reduced the mitochondrial damage score (P < 0.01). Fifth, bupivacaine significantly increased the ROS in freshly isolated cardiomyocytes, and added isoprenalin induced a further enhancement of ROS production (P < 0.05, vs. bupivacaine alone). Added esmolol significantly decreased ROS production (P < 0.05, vs. bupivacaine + isoprenalin). Our results suggest that bupivacaine depressed cardiac automaticity, conductivity and contractility, but the predominant effect was contractile dysfunction which resulted from the disruption of mitochondrial energy metabolism. β-adrenergic activation aggravated the cellular metabolism disorder and therefore contractile dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29975046>Kinetics and Degradation Mechanism of Adrenaline Derivative CpQ in Diluted Aqueous Solutions.</a></h1><p>The degradation kinetics of an adrenaline (epinephrine) derivative, CpQ, was studied in solution in the pH range of 1-12 at 40-80 °C by high-performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The pH-rate profile exhibits a bell-shaped curve with two sigmoidal regions in the specific acid-catalyzed and specific base-catalyzed regions. The pH range of maximum stability was 2.5-4.5 with the main degradation pathway being the oxidative N-dealkylation of the aliphatic amino moiety followed by fast interconversion of the resulting fragments to stable degradation products. The autoxidation reaction was slower than the reaction of the  reactive species. The chiral center underwent R to S racemization by a polar reaction mechanism under acidic conditions with a rate minimum at pH 4. The rates of degradation of the R and S enantiomers were similar across all pHs. CpQ degradation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide at 40 °C was significantly faster, and the extent of increases with pH. Metal ions bind to CpQ and catalyze its hydrolysis in the order Fe > Fe > Mg > Mn > Ti > Sr > Zn, with a rate enhancement of ≤1 order of magnitude at the studied pH values of 1 and 5. There was no buffer catalysis observed in the hydrolysis of the studied compound for maleate and phosphate but significant buffer catalysis in the case of citrate and malate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30376995>Oxidant-induced increase in norepinephrine secretion from PC12 cells is dependent on TRPM8 channel-mediated intracellular calcium elevation.</a></h1><p>Reactive  species (ROS) modulate neuronal function, including plasticity and neurotransmitter biosynthesis and release. The cellular mechanisms that underlie redox modulation of neurotransmission are not fully resolved, but potential pathways include ROS-induced alterations in Ca signaling in nerve terminals. In this study, we show that cold-sensitive receptor TRPM8 is activated by pro-oxidant tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP). Polymerase chain reaction, Western immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence indicated that TRPM8 channels are expressed in rat pheochromocytoma 12 (PC12) cells, a phenotypic model of sympathetic neurosecretion when differentiated with nerve growth factor. WS-12, a selective TRPM8 channel agonist, and tBHP increased intracellular Ca concentration in differentiated PC12 cells; an effect attenuated by AMTB, a selective TRPM8 channel blocker, and siRNA-mediated TRPM8 knockdown. Blockade of TRPM8 channels also reduced WS-12- and tBHP-evoked norepinephrine secretion from the cells. These data suggest that TRPM8 channels contribute to oxidant-induced neurotransmission in PC12 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Compensatory mechanisms help maintain adequate  supply to hypoxia sensitive organs, but burden the cardiovascular system. The aim was to investigate human compensatory mechanisms and their effects on the cardiovascular system with regard to cardiac function and morphology, blood flow redistribution, serum biomarkers of the adrenergic system and myocardial injury markers following prolonged apnoea.Seventeen elite apnoea divers performed maximal breath-hold during cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). Two breath-hold sessions were performed to assess (1) cardiac function, myocardial tissue properties and (2) blood flow. In between CMR sessions, a head MRI was performed for the assessment of signs of silent brain ischemia. Urine and blood samples were analysed prior to and up to 4 h after the first breath-hold.Mean breath-hold time was 297 ± 52 s. Left ventricular (LV) end-systolic, end-diastolic, and stroke volume increased significantly (p < 0.05). Peripheral  saturation, LV ejection fraction, LV fractional shortening, and heart rate decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Blood distribution was diverted to cerebral regions with no significant changes in the descending aorta. Catecholamine levels, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, and NT-pro-BNP levels increased significantly, but did not reach pathological levels.Compensatory effects of prolonged apnoea substantially burden the cardiovascular system. CMR tissue characterisation did not reveal acute myocardial injury, indicating that the resulting cardiovascular stress does not exceed compensatory physiological limits in healthy subjects. However, these compensatory mechanisms could overly tax those limits in subjects with pre-existing cardiac disease. For divers interested in competetive apnoea diving, a comprehensive medical exam with a special focus on the cardiovascular system may be warranted.This prospective single-centre study was approved by the institutional ethics committee review board.

In addition, cold stimulation leads to an upregulation of glycolytic enzymes. Here we have investigated the importance of glycolysis for brown adipocyte glucose consumption and thermogenesis. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown in mature adipocytes, we explored the effect of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes on brown adipocyte functions such as consumption of glucose and . Basal  consumption in brown adipocytes was equally dependent on glucose and fatty acid oxidation, whereas isoproterenol (ISO)-stimulated respiration was fueled mainly by fatty acids, with a significant contribution from glucose oxidation. Knockdown of glucose transporters in brown adipocytes not only impaired ISO-stimulated glycolytic flux but also  consumption. Diminishing glycolytic flux by knockdown of the first and final enzyme of glycolysis, i.e., hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase M (PKM), respectively, decreased glucose uptake and ISO-stimulated  consumption. HK2 knockdown had a more severe effect, which, in contrast to PKM knockdown, could not be rescued by supplementation with pyruvate. Hence, brown adipocytes rely on glucose consumption and glycolytic flux to achieve maximum thermogenic output, with glycolysis likely supporting thermogenesis not only by pyruvate formation but also by supplying intermediates for efferent metabolic pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29397598>[The clinical significance of microcirculation and  metabolism evaluation in acute kidney injury assessment in patients with septic shock after resuscitation].</a></h1><p> To evaluate the value of microcirculation and  metabolism evaluation (MicrOME) in acute kidney injury(AKI) evaluation in patients with septic shock after resuscitation.  Consecutive patients with septic shock after resuscitation and mechanical ventilation were enrolled from October 2016 to February 2017 in ICU at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.Patients were divided into 3 groups based on 10 min transcutaneous  challenge test transcutaneous partial pressure of (PtcO(2))and venoarterial pressure of carbon dioxide difference (Pv-aCO(2)) /arteriovenous O(2) content difference (Ca-vO(2)) by blood gas analysis, i.e. group A [ΔPtcO(2)>66 mmHg(1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) and Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2)≤1.23], group B (ΔPtcO(2)≤66 mmHg), group C (ΔPtcO(2)>66 mmHg and Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2)>1.23). Heart rate,mean arterial pressure,central venous pressure,noradrenaline dose,lactate,Pv-aCO(2),Ca-vO(2), lactate clearance, central venous  saturation(ScvO(2)) and liquid equilibrium were assessed after resuscitation.AKI staging based on Kidney Disease Global Improving Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline was analyzed. The predictive value of lactate, ScvO(2), Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2) to progression of AKI after resuscitation was determined using receiver operating characteristic(ROC)curve analysis.  A total of 49 septic shock patients were enrolled including 30 males and 19 females with mean age of (61.10±17.10)years old.There were 19 patients in group A,21 patients in group B, and 9 patients in group C. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation Ⅱ score was 20.92±7.19 and sequential organ failure assessment score 12.02±3.28. There were 4 patients with AKI and 1 progressed in group A, 11 patients with AKI and 2 progressed in group B, 6 patients with AKI and 4 progressed in group C. The cutoff value of Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2) was equal or more than 2.20 for predicting progression of AKI, resulting in a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 73.8%.  MicrOME is a significant parameter to predict the progression of AKI in patients with septic shock after resuscitation.

Herein we show that daily β -agonist treatment attenuates training-induced enhancements in exercise performance and maximal  consumption, and alters muscle proteome signature and phenotype in trained young men. Daily β -agonist treatment abolished several of the training-induced enhancements in muscle oxidative capacity and caused a repression of muscle metabolic pathways; furthermore, β -agonist treatment induced a slow-to-fast twitch muscle phenotype transition. The present study indicates that chronic β -agonist treatment confounds the positive effect of high intensity training on exercise performance and oxidative capacity, which is of interest for the large proportion of persons using inhaled β -agonists on a daily basis, including athletes.Although the effects of training have been studied for decades, data on muscle proteome signature remodelling induced by high intensity training in relation to functional changes in humans remains incomplete. Likewise, β -agonists are frequently used to counteract exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, but the effects β -agonist treatment on muscle remodelling and adaptations to training are unknown. In a placebo-controlled parallel study, we randomly assigned 21 trained men to 4 weeks of high intensity training with (HIT+β A) or without (HIT) daily inhalation of β -agonist (terbutaline, 4 mg dose ). Of 486 proteins identified by mass-spectrometry proteomics of muscle biopsies sampled before and after the intervention, 32 and 85 were changing (false discovery rate (FDR) ≤5%) with the intervention in HIT and HIT+β A, respectively. Proteome signature changes were different in HIT and HIT+β A (P = 0.005), wherein β -agonist caused a repression of 25 proteins in HIT+β A compared to HIT, and an upregulation of 7 proteins compared to HIT. β -Agonist repressed or even downregulated training-induced enrichment of pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation and glycogen metabolism, but upregulated pathways related to histone trimethylation and the nucleosome. Muscle contractile phenotype changed differently in HIT and HIT+β A (P ≤ 0.001), with a fast-to-slow twitch transition in HIT and a slow-to-fast twitch transition in HIT+β A. β -Agonist attenuated training-induced enhancements in maximal  consumption (P ≤ 0.01) and exercise performance (6.1 vs. 11.6%, P ≤ 0.05) in HIT+β A compared to HIT. These findings indicate that daily β -agonist treatment attenuates the beneficial effects of high intensity training on exercise performance and oxidative capacity, and causes remodelling of muscle proteome signature towards a fast-twitch phenotype.© 2017 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to see whether the molecular mechanisms underlying the damaging action of adrenaline on DNA are mediated by reactive  species (ROS). To do that, we exposed human whole blood cells to 10 μmol L-1adrenaline or 50 μmol L-1H2O2(used as positive control) that were separately pre-treated or post-treated with 500 μmol L-1of quercetin, a scavenger of free radicals. Quercetin significantly reduced DNA damage in both pre- and post-treatment protocols, which suggests that adrenaline mainly acts via the production of ROS. This mechanism is also supported by gradual lowering of adrenaline and H2O2-induced DNA damage 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after treatment. Our results clearly show that DNA repair mechanisms are rather effective against ROS-mediated DNA damage induced by adrenaline.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29138472>Functional characterization of the Ucp1-associated oxidative phenotype of human epicardial adipose tissue.</a></h1><p>Brown fat presence and metabolic activity has been associated with lower body mass index, higher insulin sensitivity and better cardiometabolic profile in humans. We, and others, have previously reported the presence of Ucp1, a marker of brown adipocytes, in human epicardial adipose tissue (eAT). Characterization of the metabolic activity and associated physiological relevance of Ucp1 within eAT, however, is still awaited. Here, we validate the presence of Ucp1 within human eAT and its 'beige' nature. Using in-vitro analytical approaches, we further characterize its thermogenic potential and demonstrate that human eAT is capable of undergoing enhanced uncoupling respiration upon stimulation. Direct biopsy gene expression analysis reveals a negative association between thermogenic markers and oxidative stress-related genes in this depot. Consistently, isoproterenol (Iso) stimulation of eAT leads to a downregulation of secreted proteins included in the GO terms 'cell redox homeostasis' and 'protein folding'. In addition, cardiac endothelial cells exhibit a downregulation in the expression of adhesion markers upon treatment with Iso-stimulated eAT derived conditioned media. Overall, these observations suggest that Ucp1- associated metabolic activity plays a significant role in local tissue homeostasis within eAT and can plausibly alter its communication with neighboring cells of the cardiovascular system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28430866>Maternal high-sucrose diets altered vascular large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels via reactive  species in offspring rats.</a></h1><p>Overnutrition during pregnancy could increase risks of cardiovascular diseases in late life. This study investigated whether and how reactive  species (ROS) may influence functions of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BKCa) in the offspring exposed to prenatal high sucrose (HS). We found that prenatal HS diets significantly increased phenylephrine (PE)-induced vessel contractions in mesenteric arteries of the adult offspring. Pretreatment with iberiotoxin (BKCa blocker, IBTX) significantly increased PE-mediated vascular contractions in the control, not in the HS group. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that BKCa current density and single-channel current were reduced in the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of the HS offspring. The expression of BKCa alpha, beta1 subunits in mesenteric arteries was decreased in the HS offspring, indicating that both activity and number of BKCa channels in HS offspring were reduced. Superoxide production and NADPH oxidase (NOX)4 of the HS offspring were elevated. Following inhibiting NOX by apocynin, vasoconstriction in the HS offspring was weakened and the reduced currents in the VSMCs were improved with altered protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. The results suggested that NOX4-derived ROS might inhibit the offspring vascular BKCa channel activity via AKT pathway.© The Authors 2017.

Endothelial cell (EC) injury and glycocalyx (GC) degradation occur following traumatic shock and are key factors in the development of trauma-induced coagulopathy and result in impaired microvascular perfusion and accompanying organ failure. Acute hyperglycemia has been shown to result in the loss of the GC layer, EC inflammation, and activation of coagulation in vivo. We postulated that acute hyperglycemia would exacerbate trauma-induced EC injury and GC shedding and integrity. This was studied using a microfluidic device in a biomimetic in vitro model.Human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers established in the microfluidic channels of a microfluidic device well plate were perfused at constant shear overnight. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers were then exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation and epinephrine followed by the addition of varying concentrations of glucose.Glycocalyx shedding and loss of dimension, as well as EC injury/activation, were noted after exposure to the biomimetic conditions of trauma/shock in our study. Similar but less dramatic findings were noted after acute hyperglycemia. Exposure to hyperglycemia exacerbated the adverse effects on the GC and EC following hypoxia/reoxygenation plus epinephrine exposure and may be related to enhanced production of reactive  species.Microfluidic device study may allow the preclinical assessment and development of therapeutic strategies of the vascular barrier under stress conditions.</p></html>
