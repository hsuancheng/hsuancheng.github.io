We hypothesized that there might be a relationship between dietary fatty  composition and the risk of developing incident UC.Overall, 62 new cases of UC and 124 healthy age and sex-matched controls were studied. Information on usual diet was measured by a validated country-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounding variables was carried out to compare dietary fatty  intakes between cases and controls.We found positive associations between dietary intake of total fat (P value for trend <0.01),  (P value for trend <0.01), saturated fatty  (SAFA) (P value for trend = 0.02), total polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) (P value for trend = 0.04), and trans fat (P value for trend <0.01).Our results showed that higher consumptions of total fats, , SAFAs, total PUFAs, trans fat, MUFAs, and linoleic  are significantly associated with increased risk for UC; however, no statistically significant associations were detected between the risk of disease and n-3 PUFAs and cholesterol intake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021137>A lipidomics investigation into the intervention of celastrol in experimental .</a></h1><p>Celastrol is well known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. In this study, the efficacy of celastrol against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice was established and the mechanism was investigated using lipidomics. Celastrol treatment significantly alleviated DSS-induced  in mice, as revealed by the body weight, colon length, scores of rectal bleeding and diarrhea, serum TNF-α level, and histological analysis results. Lipidomics analysis based on UPLC/MS revealed characteristic changes in the metabolic profiles of the  mice, with altered levels of lipid markers associated with IBD, including LPC18 : 0, LPC18 : 1, LPC18 : 2, sphingomyelin (SM), and increased LPC18 : 0/LPC18 : 1 and LPC18 : 0/LPC18 : 2 ratios. For the celastrol-treated  mice, however, levels of the above lipid markers were restored, together with recovered saturated LPC/unsaturated LPC ratios. Accordingly, using GC-MS analysis, increased stearic  (C18 : 0)/ (C18 : 1) and stearic  (C18 : 0)/linoleic  (C18 : 2) ratios were observed in  mice, which were later recovered after celastrol treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the liver expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), the key enzyme controlling the desaturation of saturated fatty , was dramatically inhibited in IBD mice, and was obviously recovered after celastrol treatment. These results suggest that the increased saturated LPC/unsaturated LPC (and saturated fatty /unsaturated fatty ) ratios associated with SCD1 down-regulation could be regarded as biomarkers of , and celastrol alleviates DSS-induced  partially via up-regulation of SCD1, restoring the altered balance between stearic - and -derived lipid species, which plays an important role in alleviating . In all, this study provided the scientific basis for further development of celastrol in treating IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25505251>A gut microbial metabolite of linoleic , 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic , ameliorates intestinal epithelial barrier impairment partially via GPR40-MEK-ERK pathway.</a></h1><p>Gut microbial metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids have attracted much attention because of their various physiological properties. Dysfunction of tight junction (TJ) in the intestine contributes to the pathogenesis of many disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. We evaluated the effects of five novel gut microbial metabolites on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced barrier impairment in Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium-induced  in mice. 10-Hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic  (HYA), a gut microbial metabolite of linoleic , suppressed TNF-α and dextran sulfate sodium-induced changes in the expression of TJ-related molecules, occludin, zonula occludens-1, and myosin light chain kinase. HYA also suppressed the expression of TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) mRNA and protein expression in Caco-2 cells and colonic tissue. In addition, HYA suppressed the protein expression of TNFR2 in murine intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, HYA significantly up-regulated G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 40 expression in Caco-2 cells. It also induced [Ca(2+)]i responses in HEK293 cells expressing human GPR40 with higher sensitivity than linoleic , its metabolic precursor. The barrier-recovering effects of HYA were abrogated by a GPR40 antagonist and MEK inhibitor in Caco-2 cells. Conversely, 10-hydroxyoctadacanoic , which is a gut microbial metabolite of  and lacks a carbon-carbon double bond at Δ12 position, did not show these TJ-restoring activities and down-regulated GPR40 expression. Therefore, HYA modulates TNFR2 expression, at least partially, via the GPR40-MEK-ERK pathway and may be useful in the treatment of TJ-related disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25205418>Palmitoylethanolamide, a naturally occurring lipid, is an orally effective intestinal anti-inflammatory agent.</a></h1><p>Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) acts via several targets, including cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) ion channels, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR α) and orphan G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GRR55), all involved in the control of intestinal inflammation.

Inflammation was assessed by evaluating inflammatory markers/parameters and by histology; intestinal permeability by a fluorescent method; colonic cell proliferation by immunohistochemistry; PEA and endocannabinoid levels by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; receptor and enzyme mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR.DNBS administration caused inflammatory damage, increased colonic levels of PEA and endocannabinoids, down-regulation of mRNA for TRPV1 and GPR55 but no changes in mRNA for CB1 , CB2 and PPARα. Exogenous PEA (i.p. and/or p.o., 1 mg·kg(-1) ) attenuated inflammation and intestinal permeability, stimulated colonic cell proliferation, and increased colonic TRPV1 and CB1 receptor expression. The anti-inflammatory effect of PEA was attenuated or abolished by CB2 receptor, GPR55 or PPARα antagonists and further increased by the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine.PEA improves murine experimental , the effect being mediated by CB2 receptors, GPR55 and PPARα, and modulated by TRPV1 channels.© 2014 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27016717>, hydroxytyrosol and n-3 fatty acids collectively modulate  through reduction of oxidative stress and IL-8 synthesis; in vitro and in vivo studies.</a></h1><p>Our recent study has demonstrated that medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and monounsaturated fatty acids potentiate the beneficial effects of fish oil on risk factors of cardiovascular disease. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of MCT or olive oil on the protective and mucosal healing ability of fish oil in ulcerative  using cell simulation and animal models. Caco-2 cells grown in medium chain fatty acids enriched medium has exaggerated t-butyl hydroperoxide induced cell damage, GSH depletion, and IL-1β induced IL-8 synthesis, compared to the cells grown in  & hydroxytyrosol (OT) enriched medium. Further, combined treatment of cells with eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic , and OT has remarkably attenuated the cell damage, and IL-8 synthesis, compared to individual treatments. To evaluate the effect of these lipid formulations in vivo, adult Wistar rats were fed diet enriched with high amount of medium chain triglycerides (MCT), virgin olive oil, or their combination with fish oil.  was induced in rats using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7days followed by 10-days of recovery period. Rats of MCT group exhibit severe disease activity, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in the colon compared to the olive oil group. Furthermore, there was persistent body weight loss, loose stools, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in the rats of MCT group, even after DSS was withdrawn from drinking water. Conversely, fish oil has remarkably attenuated the DSS induced alterations in both MCT and olive oil diet groups with significantly greater effect in the olive oil group. Thus, MCT increase the susceptibility to  through oxidative damage and IL-8 synthesis in intestinal epithelial cells. The beneficial effects of virgin olive oil could be partially attributed to hydroxytyrosol.

The transient nature of the gene expression of mRNA would be expected to be beneficial for avoiding undesired side effects. Since the mRNA is a vulnerable molecule, a development of a carrier that can deliver the mRNA to the cytoplasm has a high priority. We report herein on the development of a system for delivering mRNA to the inflammatory lesion in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  model. We modulated molecular structures of an ionizable lipid, an SS-cleavable and pH-activated lipid-like material (ssPalm). Among the fatty acids investigated,  scaffolds (ssPalmO) appeared to be more biocompatible than either myristic  or linoleic  scaffolds with the  model. The structural modification of the hydrophilic head groups from linear tertiary amines to piperazine rings (ssPalmO-Paz4-C2) resulted in a more than 10-fold higher increasing in the transgene activity in inflammatory colon. The most notable observation is that the transgene activity in the inflammatory colon is significantly higher than that in liver, the major clearance organ of lipid nanoparticles. Collectively, the ssPalmO-Paz4-C2 represents a promising material for the delivery of an mRNA to inflammatory lesions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28119098>Anti-inflammatory effects of Brucea javanica oil emulsion by suppressing NF-κB activation on dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative  in mice.</a></h1><p>Brucea javanica is an important traditional medicinal herb used for the treatment of dysentery, malaria, inflammation and cancer in southeast Asia for many years. However, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Brucea javanica in the treatment of dysentery (also known as ulcerative , UC) has not been fully illuminated. Brucea javanica oil emulsion (BJOE) is the major active and most common application form of Brucea javanica oil (BJO), which has a variety of pharmacological activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory effect of BJOE and possible mechanism of action on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in mice.The components of BJOE were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Balb/C mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 30mg/mL) induced  were treated with BJOE (0.5, 1 and 2g/kg) and two positive drugs (sulfasalazine, SASP, 200mg/kg; and azathioprine, AZA, 13mg/kg) once daily by gavage for 7 days. Mice in normal control group and DSS group were orally given the same volume of distilled water and soybean lecithin suspension (0.15g/kg) respectively. The effects of BJOE on DSS-induced UC were assessed by determination of body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological analysis, as well as levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The mRNA expression of MPO, iNOS and COX-2 in colon tissues was detected by qRT-PCR. In addition, NF-κB p65, p-p65 and IκB-α, p-IκBα protein expression levels in colon tissues were investigated using Western blotting.The major components of BJOE were found to be  (62.68%) and linoleic  (19.53%) as detected by GC-MS. Our results indicated that BJOE, SASP and AZA showed beneficial effect on DSS-induced  in mice, and significantly reduced the body weight loss and DAI, restored the colon length, repaired colonic pathological variations, decreased histological scores, and decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and IFN-γ) as compared with the DSS group. In addition, the mRNA expression of MPO, iNOS and COX-2 induced by DSS treatment was remarkably inhibited by BJOE, SASP or AZA treatments. Furthermore, when compared with DSS-treated mice, the activation of NF-κB was significantly inhibited by AZA and BJOE treatment.Our study shows that BJOE possessed appreciable anti-inflammatory effect against murine experimental UC induced by DSS. The protective mechanism of BJOE may involve inhibition of NF-κB signal transduction pathways and subsequent down-regulation of inflammatory mediators. These findings suggest that BJOE might be an efficacious and promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of UC. Our investigation might also provide experimental evidence for the traditional application of Brucea javanica in the treatment of dysentery and might add new dimension to the clinical indications for BJOE.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

As a lipid droplet-associated protein, Cideb facilitated the export of lipids from enterocytes and promoted intestinal lipid absorption. We found that Cideb was upregulated in the colonic mucosa of both UC patients and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse , but its roles in the pathogenesis of UC are still ill-defined.Acute  was induced with DSS in Cideb-null and wild-type mice, and the inflammation and oxidative stress were evaluated in the colonic mucosa. Moreover, triglyceride accumulation and oxidative stress were further analyzed in polarized Caco-2 cells with overexpression of Cideb.Our present data indicated that Cideb-null mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced , and consumption of a high-fat diet exacerbated the deterioration of DSS-induced  in Cideb-null mice. Moreover, Cideb deficiency increased the colonic oxidative stress in DSS-treated mice and more significant under a high-fat diet condition. In exploring the mechanism, we found that Cideb deficiency elevated the lipid content in both feces and the colonic mucosa of DSS-treated mice, especially those fed with a high-fat diet. The in vitro evidence proved that Cideb expression reduced triglyceride accumulation and oxidative stress in polarized Caco-2 cells in the presence of .Our data suggest that Cideb plays a protective role against the development of UC by reducing the lipid accumulation and oxidative damage in the colonic mucosa.

The gut microbiota connect diet to the metabolism by producing small molecules via diverse metabolic pathways. In this study we aimed to investigate the dietary preferences of IBD patients, and to explore the interactions among gut microbiota composition, dietary components, and metabolites in relation to IBD.Dietary preferences of IBD patients (including those with ulcerative  [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]) and health controls were investigated, and their gut microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analyses of fecal and biopsy samples. The metabolite profiles of the samples were then analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses.The daily intake of folic , niacin, vitamins C and D, calcium, and selenium differed significantly between patients with IBD and healthy controls. A decrease in long-chain (such as arachidic, and ) and medium-chain fatty acids (sebacic  and isocaproic ) as well as bile  was observed in patients with IBD. Compared with healthy controls, 22 microbial species (including Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and Clostridium clostridioforme CAG132) in the UC group and 37 microbial species (such as Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) in the CD group were found to be correlated to diet and metabolites. Bacteroides fragilis was enriched in patients with IBD and associated with multi-nutrients, and 21 metabolites including 25-hydroxyvitamin D and taurolithocholic .This study provides an interaction network to identify key micronutrients, microbiota components and metabolites that contribute to IBD.© 2019 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29753956>Smart gated magnetic silica mesoporous particles for targeted colon drug delivery: New approaches for inflammatory bowel diseases treatment.</a></h1><p>Magnetic mesoporous silica microparticles were loaded with safranin O (S1) and with hydrocortisone (S2) and the outer surface functionalized with a bulky azo derivative bearing urea moieties. Aqueous suspensions of both solids at pH 7.4 showed negligible payload release whereas a marked delivery was observed in the presence of sodium dithionite due to the rupture of the azo bonds. Besides, a moderate cargo release was observed at acidic pH due to the hydrolysis of the urea bonds that linked the azo derivative onto the external surface of the inorganic scaffolds. In vitro digestion models showed that S1 and S2 microparticles could be used for the controlled release of payload in the reducing colon environment (in which azoreductase enzymes are present). On the other hand, in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed that safranine O release from S1 microparticles was concentrated in colon. The performance of S2 microparticles for the treatment of  in rats (induced by oral administration of a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  solution) was tested. The controlled release of hydrocortisone from S2 in the colon of injured rats induced marked reduction in colon/body weight ratio and in clinical activity score. Also, histological studies showed a marked decrease in inflammation followed by intensive regeneration and almost normal mucosal structure of the individuals treated with S2. Besides, the use of a magnetic belt increased the therapeutic performances of S2 due to an enhanced retention time of the particles in the colon.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Modification of fat metabolism may alter inflammation and disease severity. Our aim was to assess differences in dietary and serum fatty  levels between control and UC subjects and associations with disease activity and inflammatory cytokines.Dietary histories, serum, and colonic tissue samples were prospectively collected from 137 UC subjects and 38 controls. Both histologic injury and the Mayo Disease Activity Index were assessed. Serum and tissue cytokines were measured by Luminex assay. Serum fatty acids were obtained by gas chromatography.UC subjects had increased total fat and  (OA) intake, but decreased arachidonic  (AA) intake vs controls. In serum, there was less percent saturated fatty  (SFA) and AA, with higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), linoleic , OA, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosapentaenoic  (DPA) in UC. Tissue cytokine levels were directly correlated with SFA and inversely correlated with PUFA, EPA, and DPA in UC subjects, but not controls. 5-aminosalicylic  therapy blunted these associations.In summary, we found differences in serum fatty acids in UC subjects that correlated with pro-inflammatory tissue cytokines.

Recently we reported that one of the serotonin-fatty  conjugates, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), previously found in gut tissue of mouse and pig, attenuates the IL-23-IL-17 signaling axis in LPS-stimulated mice macrophages. However, its presence and effects in humans remained to be elucidated. Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty  conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with palmitic  (PA-5-HT), stearic  (SA-5-HT) and  (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified. Among these, DHA-5-HT was the most potent in inhibiting IL-17 and CCL-20, typical Th17 pro-inflammatory mediators, by Concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human PBMCs. These results underline the idea that DHA-5-HT is a gut-specific endogenously produced mediator with the capacity to modulate the IL-17/Th17 signaling response.

Moreover, CMP33 decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines in the colon tissue and serum of colitic mice. Using iTRAQ-coupled- nano-HPLC-MS/MS-based proteomics, the protein profiles after TNBS, high- or low-dose CMP33 and salazosulfapyridine (SASP) treatments were compared and many differentially expressed proteins were identified. Among them, 7 proteins (Hmgcs2, Fabp2, Hp, B4galnt2, B3gnt6, Sap and Ca1) were proposed to be the common targeting protein group (TPG) of CMP33 and drug SASP. Particularly, some targeting proteins were CMP33-dose-specific: high-dose-specific TPG (Mtco3, Gal-6, Mptx, S100 g and Hpx) and low-dose-specific TPG (Zg16, Hexb, Insl5, Cept1, Hspb6 and Ifi27l2b), suggesting the complex acting mechanism of CMP33.
