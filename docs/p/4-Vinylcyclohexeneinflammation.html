Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene diepoxide (97% pure) in acetone by dermal application to individually housed F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice for 14 days, 13 weeks, 15 months, and 2 years. Additional studies included evaluation of immune function after a 5-day dermal exposure and evaluation of the oral toxicity of 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene diepoxide in 16-day and 13-week corn oil gavage studies. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Fourteen-Day Dermal Studies: In the 14-day studies, all rats that received 924 mg/kg or higher (equivalent to 139 mg/rat or higher for males and 112 mg/rat of higher for females) died before the end of the studies. Final mean body weights were lower than those of vehicle controls in males receiving 68 mg/rat and in females receiving 57 mg/rat. Excoriations on the skin at the application site were observed in the groups receiving 57 mg/rat or more. Males receiving 139 mg/rat and females receiving 112 mg/rat had congestion and/or hypoplasia of the bone marrow; most had acute nephrosis. Skin lesions, including epidermal necrosis and ulceration, epidermal hyperplasia, and hyperkeratosis, were found in the 139 and 112 mg/rat group; similar lesions of lesser severity were seen in the two lowest dose groups of each sex. All mice that received 1,787 mg/kg (equivalent to 43/mouse for males and 37 mg/mouse for females) and 3/5 male mice and 5/5 female mice that received 889 mg/kg (equivalent to 19-21 mg/mouse) died before the end of the 14-day dermal studies. Final mean body weights of exposed and vehicle control mice were generally similar. Lesions of the skin at the site of application were seen in 4/5 males and 4/5 females receiving 5 mg/mouse and all mice receiving 10 and 21 (males) or 19 (females) mg/mouse and included epidermal and sebaceous gland hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and ulceration. Thirteen-Week Studies: In the 13-week dermal studies, all rats survived to the end of the studies (doses up to 60 mg/rat). The final mean body weights of the 60 mg/rat groups were 9%-14% lower than those of the vehicle controls. Compound-related clinical signs in the 60 mg/rat groups observed during the second half of the studies included redness, scabs, and ulceration at the application site and burrowing behavior after dermal application. Hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands and acanthosis (hyperplasia) and hyperkeratosis of the squamous epithelium were seen at the site of application. In mice, no compound-related deaths occurred after applications of up to 10 mg/mouse in 13-week dermal studies, and final mean body weights of exposed and vehicle control mice were similar. Relative liver and kidney weights increased with dose. Compound-related lesions of the skin included sebaceous gland hyperplasia and acanthosis (hyperplasia) and hyperkeratosis of the stratified squamous epithelium at the site of application; ovarian atrophy was also considered to be compound related. In the 13-week oral studies, the major target organ of toxicity in rats and mice was the forestomach, as indicated by hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia of the stratified squamous epithelium. In female mice, ovarian atrophy was seen in 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene diepoxide-dosed groups. Two-year studies were conducted by administering 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene diepoxide in acetone by dermal application, 5 days per week for 105 weeks to groups of 60 rats of each sex at 0, 15, or 30 mg/animal. Groups of 60 mice of each sex were administered 0, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/animal on the same schedule for 103 weeks. None of the doses selected had produced ulceration of skin in 13-week studies. Ten animals from each group were killed and examined during month 15 for toxicologic evaluation. Immune Function Studies: The immunotoxic effects of 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene diepoxide were studied in male B6C3F1 mice in male B6C3F1 mice after a 5-day dermal exposure at doses ranging from 2.5 to 10 mg/mouse per day. 4-Vinyl-1-cyclohexene diepoxide was immunosuppressive at 10 mg/mouse and, to a lesser extent, at 5 mg/mouse, as indicated by a decrease in peripheral lymphocytes and the in vitro lymphoproliferative response to phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A in the high dose group and suppression of the antibody plaque-forming-cell response in the 5 and 10 mg/mouse groups. Fifteen-Month Evaluation: Two of 10 male rats that received 30 mg had a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin at or adjacent to the site of application. Acanthosis was seen in exposed rats (mild severity at 30 mg/rat and minimal severity at 15 mg/rat); hyperkeratosis was observed for rats in the 30 mg/rat groups. Compound-related nonneoplastic skin lesions in mice included acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and sebaceous gland hyperplasia/hypertrophy. Squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas were seen in mice that received 5 or 10 mg/mouse; none was seen in vehicle control or low dose groups (papillomas--male: mid dose, 1/10; high dose, 2/10; female: 1/10; 1/10; carcinomas-- male: 2/10; 8/10; female: 2/10; 5/10). One vehicle control and all exposed female mice had atrophy of the ovary. Hyperplasia of the ovarian surface epithelium was seen in 8/10 females receiving 5 mg/mouse and 9/9 females receiving 10 mg/mouse. Two of nine females receiving 10 mg/mouse had granulosa cell tumors of the ovary, and 1/9 females receiving 10 mg/mouse had an ovarian papillary cystadenoma. Body Weights and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: In general, the body weights and survival were lower in mid and high dose groups than in vehicle controls. The survival was lower in exposed groups, primarily because of neoplasms (survival at week 105--male rats: vehicle control, 7/50; low dose, 8/50; high dose, 4/50; female rats: 27/50; 23/50; 15/50; male mice: vehicle control, 38/50; low dose, 35/50; mid dose, 4/50; high dose, 0/50; female mice: 30/50; 31/50; 15/50; 0/50). All high dose male mice died by week 83; the 10 surviving high dose female mice were killed during week 85. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: Acanthosis and sebaceous gland hypertrophy of skin from the scapula or back were observed at substantially increased incidences in exposed male and female rats. Squamous cell papillomas in male rats and squamous cell carcinomas in male and female rats were observed only in exposed rats (squamous cell carcinomas--male: vehicle control, 0/50; low dose, 33/50; high dose, 36/50; female: 0/50; 16/50; 34/50). The incidences of basal cell adenomas or carcinomas (combined) were increased (male: 0/50; 1/50; 6/50; female: 0/50; 3/50; 4/50). For exposed mice, acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and necrotizing  of the skin were observed over the scapula or back. Squamous cell carcinomas were found only in exposed mice (male: vehicle control, 0/50; low dose, 14/50; mid dose, 39/50; high dose, 42/50; female: 0/50; 6/50; 37/50; 41/50). Follicular atrophy and tubular hyperplasia of the ovary in female mice were increased (atrophy: 12/50; 43/49; 47/50; tubular hyperplasia: 5/50; 35/49; 38/49; 34/50). Mid and high dose females had benign or malignant granulosa cell tumors (0/50; 0/49; 7/49; 12/50) and benign mixed tumors (0/50; 0/49; 11/49; 6/50). The combined incidences of luteomas, granulosa cell tumors, benign mixed tumors, or malignant granulosa cell tumors in mid and high dose female mice were increased (1/50; 0/49; 17/49; 18/50). The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined) in exposed female mice were marginally increased (4/50; 9/50; 11/50; 7/50). Genetic Toxicology: 4-Vinyl-1-cyclohexene diepoxide was mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, and TA1535 with and without exogenous metabolic activation; the compound was equivocally mutagenic in strain TA1537 without S9 but gave a positive response in the presence of activation. 4-Vinyl-1-cyclohexene diepoxide induced resistance to trifluorothymidine in mouse L5178Y/TK cells without exogenous metabolic activation; it was not tested with activation. 4-Vinyl-1-cyclohexene diepoxide induced sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells in the presence and absence of exogenous metabolic activation. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year dermal studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene diepoxide for male and female F344/N rats, as shown by squamous cell and basal cell neoplasms of the skin. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene diepoxide for male and female B6C3F1 mice, as shown by squamous cell carcinomas of the skin in males and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin and ovarian neoplasms in females; increased incidences of lung neoplasms in females may also have been related to chemical application.

The intact aging model fails to achieve very low estrogen levels, and the ovariectomy model lacks a perimenopause phase. A new rodent model of accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) successfully replicates human perimenopause and postmenopause, including estrous acyclicity and fluctuating, followed by undetectable, estrogen levels, and allows for the dissociation of the effects of hormone levels from the effects of aging. In this model, an ovotoxic chemical,  diepoxide (VCD), selective for primary and primordial follicles, is injected intraperitonelly in animals for 15 days. As the mature follicle population is depleted through natural cycling, ovarian failure follows increasing periods of acyclity. Administered at low doses, VCD specifically causes apoptotic cell death of primordial follicles but does not affect other peripheral tissues, including the liver and spleen, nor does it affect brain  markers. In addition to reducing confounds associated with genetic and surgical manipulations, the AOF model maintains the presence of ovarian tissue which importantly parallels to the menopause transition in humans. The VCD injection procedure can be applied to studies using transgenic or knockout mice strains, or in other disease-state models (e.g., ischemia, atherosclerosis, or diabetes). This AOF model of menopause will generate new insights into women's health particularly in determining the critical periods (i.e., a window of opportunity) during perimenopause for restoring ovarian hormones for the most efficacious effect on memory and mood disorders as well as other menopausal symptoms.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although the immune system is both necessary and required for the development of angiotensin II (ANG II) hypertension in men, we have demonstrated that premenopausal women are protected from T cell-mediated hypertension. The goal of the current study was to test the hypotheses that ) female protection against T cell-mediated ANG II hypertension is eliminated following progression into menopause and ) T regulatory cells (Tregs) provide premenopausal protection against ANG II-induced hypertension. Menopause was induced in Rag-1 mice (via  diepoxide), and all mice received a 14-day ANG II infusion. Donor CD3 T cells were adoptively transferred 3 wk before ANG II infusion. In the absence of T cells, systolic blood pressure responses to ANG II were similar to those seen in premenopausal mice (Δ12 mmHg). After adoptive transfer of T cells, ANG II significantly increased systolic blood pressure in postmenopausal females (Δ28 mmHg). A significant increase in F4/80 positive renal macrophages, an increase in renal inflammatory gene expression, along with a reduction in renal expression of mannose receptor C-type 1, a marker for M2 macrophages, accompanied the increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP). Flow cytometric analysis identified that Tregs were significantly decreased in the spleen and kidneys of Rag-1 menopausal mice versus premenopausal females, following ANG II infusion. In a validation study, an anti-CD25 antibody was used to deplete Tregs in premenopausal mice, which induced a significant increase in SBP. These results demonstrate that premenopausal protection against T cell-mediated ANG II hypertension is eliminated once females enter menopause, suggesting that a change in hormonal status upregulates macrophage-induced proinflammatory and T cell-dependent responses. Furthermore, we are the first to report that the presence of Tregs are required to suppress ANG II hypertension in premenopausal females. Whether progression into menopause eliminated female protection against T cell-mediated hypertension was examined. Menopausal mice without T cells remained protected against angiotensin II (ANG II) hypertension; however, in the presence of T cells, blood pressure responses to ANG II increased significantly in menopause. Underlying mechanisms examined were anti-inflammatory protection provided by T regulatory cells in premenopausal females and renal inflammatory processes involving macrophage infiltration and cytokine activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27647594>Evidence of oxidative damage and reproductive dysfunction accompanying  diepoxide exposure in female Wistar rats.</a></h1><p> diepoxide (VCD) is an occupational chemical widely reported to deplete ovarian follicles in rodents. Here, we investigated VCD-induced reproductive dysfunction in female Wistar rats. The rats were orally administered with VCD (100, 250 and 500mg/kg) for twenty-eight days. Thereafter, we evaluated selected biomarkers of oxidative damage, , endocrine disruption, and apoptosis. We observed that VCD increased ovarian and uterine malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities in rats (p<0.05). Also, VCD induced hormonal imbalance, increased ovarian superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and depleted uterine SOD activity and ovarian glutathione (GSH) level in rats (p<0.05). Lastly, VCD markedly increase immunohistochemical expressions of ovarian cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Caspase-9 and Caspase-3. Overall, VCD induced reproductive dysfunctions in rats via ovarian and uterine oxidative damage, hormonal imbalance, as well as  and apoptosis in the ovary of rats.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, there is paucity of information on the precise biochemical and molecular mechanisms of VCD-induced male reproductive toxicity.This study investigated the influence of VCD on testicular and epidydimal functions following oral exposure of Wistar rats to VCD at 0, 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg for 28 consecutive days.Administration of VCD significantly decreased the body weight gain and organo-somatic indices of the testes and epididymis. When compared with the control, VCD significantly decreased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in the testes whereas it significantly decreased superoxide dismutase activity but increased catalase activity in the epididymis. Moreover, while glutathione peroxidase activity and glutathione level remain unaffected, exposure of rats to VCD significantly increased glutathione S-transferase activity as well as hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde levels in testes and epididymis of the treated rats. The spermiogram of VCD-treated rats showed significant decrease in epididymal sperm count, sperm progressive motility, testicular sperm number and daily sperm production when compared with the control. Administration of VCD significantly decreased circulatory concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and testosterone along with testicular and epididymal degeneration in the treated rats. Immunohistochemical analysis showed significantly increased cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, caspase-9 and caspase-3 protein expressions in the testes of VCD-treated rats.Exposure to VCD induces testicular and epidydimal dysfunctions via endocrine suppression, disruption of antioxidant enzymes activities, increase in biomarkers of oxidative stress,  and apoptosis in rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27258136>Hepatic and renal toxicological evaluations of an industrial ovotoxic chemical,  diepoxide, in both sexes of Wistar rats.</a></h1><p> diepoxide (VCD) is an industrial occupational health hazard chemical because it induces ovotoxicity in rodents. The current study investigated the impacts of VCD on selected hepatic and renal markers of oxidative stress and  in both sexes of Wistar rats. Thus, male and female rats were randomly distributed into four groups of ten rats per group, and dosed orally with VCD for 28days. The control male and female groups of rats received corn oil only, while each of the three remaining groups of both sexes of rats received VCD (100, 250 and 500mg/kg BW) respectively. Thereafter, biomarkers of hepatic and renal oxidative damage,  and immunohistochemical expressions of iNOS, COX-2, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were evaluated. The results revealed that VCD increased markers of liver and kidney functions, oxidative damage and , and disrupted the antioxidant homeostasis of the rats (p<0.05). Lastly, VCD enhanced the immunohistochemical expressions of iNOS, COX-2, caspase-9 and caspase-3 in the liver of the rats.
