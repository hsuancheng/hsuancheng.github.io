Despite the direct evidence that PQ could induce inflammatory responses in central nervous system and largely contribute to neurotoxicity, the putative adverse effects of PQ on the neuroimmune interactions have rarely been investigated. Therefore, the present study investigated underlying mechanisms of PQ-induced inflammatory response in BV-2 microglia cells. Proliferation, migration and phagocytosis of BV-2 cells upon PQ exposure were first investigated to demonstrate that PQ did stimulate BV-2 microglia into an active phenotype. Increased microglia M1 markers expression and decreased microglia  markers expression confirmed that PQ induces BV-2 cells towards M1 activation. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were determined using ELISA and western blotting assays, showing that paraquat significantly promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). The up-regulation of TLR4/MyD88 protein expressions and enhanced translocation of NF-κB p65 protein upon PQ exposure were further demonstrated. Taken together, our results suggested that PQ induces M1 microglia polarization by increased production of pro-inflammatory molecules, which could be explained by the activation of the TLR4-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

These cells have critical functions in the  mechanisms that are involved in the inhibition or progression of a wide ranges of diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases and etc. It has been showed that macrophages are generally divided into two subtypes including M1 and  which are distinguished based on their different gene expression pattern and phenotype. M1 macrophages are known as the pro-inflammatory subtype and they are participated in inflammatory mechanisms, whereas  subtypes are known as anti-inflammatory cells which are involved in the inhibition of the inflammatory pathways.  macrophages could help to tissue healing via producing anti-inflammatory cytokines. Increasing evidences indicated, appearance of different macrophage subtypes will be associated with the fate of diseases (progression versus suppression). Hence, polarization of macrophages could be introduced as an important venue in the finding, designing and developing novel therapeutic approaches. Albeit, there are different pharmacological agents which are used for treatment of various disorders, it has been shown that several natural compounds have a potential to regulate to M1 to  macrophage polarization and vice versa. Herein, for first time, we summarized new insights into the pharmacological effects of natural compounds on macrophage polarization.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434993>Isosteviol Sodium Protects against Ischemic Stroke by Modulating Microglia/Macrophage Polarization via Disruption of GAS5/miR-146a-5p sponge.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have shown that transforming microglia phenotype from pro- of M1 phenotype to anti- and tissue-repairing  phenotype may be an effective therapeutic strategy for preventing ischemic stroke brain injury. Isosteviol Sodium (STV-Na) has shown promise as a neuroprotective agent in cerebral ischemia model, although its effect on microglial polarization and chronic recovery after stroke is not clear. Here, we demonstrated that STV-Na treatment significantly reduced cerebral ischemic damage at both acute and chronic time points. STV-Na has a profound regulatory effect on microglia response after stroke. It can promote  polarization and inhibit microglia-mediated  (M1) response following stroke in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we also found that Growth Arrest-Specific 5 (GAS5) altered OGD/R-induced microglial activation by increasing Notch1 expression via miR-146a-5p, the mRNA level of GAS5 and the protein level of Notch1 in vivo and in vitro, were discovered that both downgraded with STV-Na. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that STV-Na exerted neuroprotective effects by modulating microglia/macrophage polarization in ischemic stroke via the GAS5/miR-146a-5p sponge. These findings provide new evidence that targeting STV-Na could be a treatment for the prevention of stroke-related brain damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454256>Specific Inhibition of the NLRP3 Inflammasome as an Anti-Inflammatory Strategy in Cystic Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary disease is characterized by chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and sustained neutrophil-dominant . The lack of effective anti-inflammatory therapies for people with CF (PWCF) represents a significant challenge.To identify altered immunometabolism in the CF neutrophil, and investigate the feasibility of specific inhibition of the NLR family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome as a CF anti-inflammatory strategy in vivo.Key markers of increased aerobic glycolysis, known as a Warburg effect, including cytosolic pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), phosphorylated PKM2, succinate, HIF-1α, lactate and the interleukin (IL)-1β precursor pro-IL-1β, as well as caspase-1 activity and processing of pro-IL-1β to IL-1β by the NLRP3 inflammasome, were measured in neutrophils from blood and airway secretions from healthy controls (n=12), PWCF (n=16) and PWCF post-double-lung transplant (n=6). The effects of specific inhibition of NLRP3 on airway  and bacterial clearance in a murine CF model were subsequently assessed in vivo.CF neutrophils display increased aerobic glycolysis in the systemic circulation. This effect is driven by low-level endotoxemia, unaffected by CFTR modulation, and resolves post-transplant. The increased pro-IL-1β produced is processed to its mature active form in the lipopolysaccharide-rich CF lung by the NLRP3 inflammasome via caspase-1. Specific NLRP3 inhibition in vivo with MCC950 inhibited IL-1β in the lungs of CF mice (P<0.0001), resulting in significantly reduced airway  and improved Pseudomonas clearance (P<0.0001).CF neutrophil immunometabolism is altered in response to .

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether resveratrol (RSV) could inhibit the inflammatory mediators associated with the regulation of macrophage phenotypes and functions in MI mice. We initially discovered that RSV significantly improved cardiac function and suppressed the expression of fibrosis markers, such as collagen-I, collagen-III, and fibronectin, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). RSV inhibited the expression of M1-like macrophage-related biomarkers (e.g., TNF-α and MCP-1) when bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (INF-γ). In contrast, it upregulated -like macrophage-related biomarkers (e.g., CD163 and Arg-1) when BMDMs were stimulated with interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). In addition, we found that RSV promoted -like macrophage polarization under anoxic conditions, which could be related to JAK2-SATA3 phosphorylation. In summary, RSV might promote anti-inflammatory -like polarization of macrophages after MI to improve cardiac function via the regulation of JAK2-SATA3 phosphorylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353414>Lifespan extension drug interventions affect adipose tissue  in aging.</a></h2><p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA)-sponsored Interventions Testing Program (ITP) has identified a number of dietary drug interventions that significantly extend lifespan, including rapamycin, acarbose, and 17-α estradiol. However, these drugs have diverse downstream targets, and their effects on age-associated organ-specific changes are unclear (1). Potential mechanisms by which these drugs extend life could be through their effect on inflammatory processes often noted in tissues of aging mice and humans. Our study focuses on the effects of three drugs in the ITP on  in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) of HET3 mice-including adiposity, adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) M1/ polarization, markers of cellular senescence and endoplasmic reticulum stress. We found that rapamycin led to a 56% increase of CD45+ leukocytes in gWAT, where the majority of these are ATMs. Interestingly, rapamycin led to a 217% and 106% increase of M1 (CD45+CD64+CD206-) ATMs in females and males, respectively. Our data suggest rapamycin may achieve lifespan extension in part through adipose tissue . Additionally, HET3 mice exhibit a spectrum of age-associated changes in the gWAT, but acarbose and 17-α estradiol do not strongly alter these phenotypes-suggesting that acarbose and 17- α estradiol may not influence lifespan through mechanisms involving adipose tissue .© The Author(s) 2019.

Galectin-3 (Gal-3), which is a β-galactoside binding protein, has been associated with liver fibrosis, but its role in NAFLD remains elusive. We investigated the expression of Gal-3 in liver resident cells and its potential association with liver damage in 40 children with biopsy-proven NAFLD. We found that several liver cells expressed Gal-3. The number of total Gal-3 positive cells decreased with the severity of disease and the cells were correlated with the presence of steatosis and the diagnosis of NASH. CD68 macrophages expressed Gal-3 but the number CD68/Gal-3 positive cells was significantly reduced in patients diagnosed with steatosis and NASH. Triple CD68/CD206/Gal-3, which represented the subpopulation of  macrophages, were mainly present in patients without NASH, and clearly reduced in patients with steatosis and NASH. On the contrary, the number of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA)/Gal-3 positive cells increased with the severity of fibrosis in children with NAFLD. Our data demonstrated that the number of Gal-3 positive cells was associated with tissue damage in different ways, which suggests a dual role of this protein in the pathogenesis of pediatric NAFLD, even if the role of Gal-3 deserves further studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519790>Oxytocin system alleviates intestinal  by regulating macrophages polarization in experimental colitis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic intestinal , but the accurate etiology remains to be elucidated. Increasing evidence has shown that macrophages polarize to different phenotypes depending on the intestinal microenvironment and are associated with the progression of IBD. In the present study, we investigated the effect of oxytocin, a neuroendocrinal, and pro-health peptide, on the modulation of macrophages polarization and the progression of experimental colitis. Our data demonstrated that oxytocin decreased the sensitivity of macrophages to lipopolysaccharide stimulation with lower expression of inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, but increased the sensitivity to IL-4 stimulation with enhanced expression of -type genes, arginase I (Arg1), CD206, and chitinase-like 3 (Chil3). This bidirectional modulation was partly due to the up-regulation of β-arrestin2 and resulted in the inhibition of NF-κB signaling and reinforcement of Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 phosphorylation. Moreover, oxytocin receptor (OXTR) myeloid deficiency mice were more susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) intervention compared with the wild mice. For the first time, we reveal that oxytocin-oxytocin receptor system participates in modulating the polarization of macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype and alleviates experimental colitis. These findings provide new potential insights into the pathogenesis and therapy of IBD.© 2019 The Author(s).

However, these properties are reported to be potentially harmful for the human body. The effects of low and realistic doses of three well-characterized preparations of MWCNT, obtained from the Joint Research Centre (JRC) (NM-400, NM-401, and NM-402), were assessed in two murine macrophage lines, Raw264.7, of peritoneal origin, and MH-S, derived from alveolar macrophages. Macrophage viability, evaluated with two distinct methods, was significantly lowered by NM-401 (needle-like, average length 4 μm, diameter 67 nm) with IC values of 10 μg/cm, whereas NM-400 and NM-402 (tangled, average lengths 846-1372 nm, diameter 11 nm) had much smaller effects. In contrast, at 10 μg/cm, NM-400 and NM-402 induced the M1 marker  and, consistently, a sizable accumulation of nitrites in the medium, whereas NM-401 had no significant effect. None of the MWCNT preparations induced the  marker . Phagocytic activity, assessed in Raw264.7 macrophages, was significantly reduced in cells exposed to NM-401, but not to NM-400 or NM-402. When tested on Calu-3 bronchial epithelial cell monolayers, the three MWCNT preparations did not affect cell viability, but decreased the trans-epithelial electrical resistance at the maximal dose tested (80 μg/cm), with the most evident effect detected for NM-401, even at 10 μg/cm. In conclusion, among the possible structural determinants of the toxic effects exerted by MWCNT towards macrophages and airway epithelial cells, shape and length appear the most relevant at low, realistic doses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623661>Anti-inflammatory and vasculogenic conditioning of peripheral blood mononuclear cells reinforces their therapeutic potential for radiation-injured salivary glands.</a></h2><p>There are currently no effective treatments available for patients with irreversible loss of salivary gland (SG) function caused by radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. In this study, we have developed an effective culture method to enhance the anti-inflammatory and vasculogenic phenotypes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) and investigated whether such effectively conditioned PBMNCs (E-MNCs) could regenerate radiation-injured SGs and ameliorate salivary secretory function in mice.Mouse PBMNCs were expanded in primary serum-free culture with five vasculogenic proteins for 5 days, and then the resulting cells (E-MNCs) were analyzed for their characteristics. Subsequently, 5 × 10 E-MNCs (labeled with EGFP in some experiments) were injected intra-glandularly into a mouse model of radiation-injured atrophic submandibular glands. After 2-3 weeks, the submandibular glands were harvested, and then the injected E-MNCs were tracked. Four, 8, and 12 weeks after irradiation (IR), salivary outputs were measured to evaluate the recovery of secretory function, and the gland tissues were harvested for histological and gene expression analyses to clarify the effects of cell transplantation.The resulting E-MNCs contained an enriched population of definitive CD11b/CD206-positive ( macrophage-like) cells and showed anti-inflammatory and vasculogenic characteristics. Salivary secretory function in E-MNC-transplanted mice gradually recovered after 4 weeks post-irradiation (post-IR) and reached 3.8-fold higher than that of non-transplanted mice at 12 weeks. EGFP-expressing E-MNCs were detected in a portion of the vascular endothelium and perivascular gland tissues at 2 weeks post-IR, but mainly in some microvessels at 3 weeks. Between 4 and 12 weeks post-IR, mRNA expression and histological analyses revealed that E-MNC transplantation reduced the expression of inflammatory genes and increased the level of tissue-regenerative activities such as stem cell markers, cell proliferation, and blood vessel formation. At 12 weeks post-IR, the areas of acinar and ductal cells regenerated, and the glands had less fibrosis.This effective conditioning of PBMNCs is a simple, rapid, and efficient method that provides a non-invasive source of therapeutic cells for regenerating radiation-injured atrophic SGs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511535>Efficacy of pulmonary transplantation of engineered macrophages secreting IL-4 on acute lung injury in C57BL/6J mice.</a></h2><p>Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are major causes of respiratory failure, but currently, no effective pharmacotherapy exists for these disorders. Alveolar macrophages play a critical role in both the acute/initial phase and chronic/resolving phase of ALI, rendering them a potential therapeutic target. Interleukin-4 (IL-4), a Th2 cytokine, not only directly inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors from macrophages but also drives macrophages to the anti-inflammatory and tissue remodeling  type. However, the short half-life of IL-4 in vivo hampers its effect on disease treatment. In this study, macrophages secreting IL-4 (M-IL-4) were established and used to treat ALI through pulmonary macrophage transplantation (PMT). The results showed that highly sustained levels of IL-4 and  macrophage markers were detected in mice lungs following pulmonary M-IL-4 transplantation. Furthermore, PMT improved the therapeutic effect by reducing lung , alleviating tissue injury, reducing alveolar macrophages necrotic cell death, and decreasing mortality in mice with ALI. These results suggest an efficient macrophage-based protein drug delivery strategy, and for the first time, prove the feasibility and efficacy of PMT in ALI treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487582>Novel HS-Releasing hydrogel for wound repair via in situ polarization of  macrophages.</a></h2><p>Hydrogen sulfide (HS), as a gaseous messenger, exhibits potential therapeutic effects in biological and clinical applications. Herein, an in situ forming biomimetic hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel was used as a matrix to dope a pH-controllable HS donor, JK1, to form a novel HA-JK1 hybrid system. This HA-JK1 hydrogel was designed as an ideal delivery scaffold for JK1 with pH-dependent prolonged HS releasing profile. In vitro study suggested that JK1 could induce the polarization of  phenotype indicating a higher pro-healing efficiency of macrophages. The in vivo studies on dermal wounds showed that the HA-JK1 hybrid hydrogel significantly accelerated the wound regeneration process through enhanced re-epithelialization, collagen deposition, angiogenesis and cell proliferation. Furthermore, the in vivo results also demonstrated a higher level of  polarization in HA-JK1 treated group with reduced  and improved wound remodeling effects, which was consistent with the in vitro results. These observations could be considered as a key to the efficient wound treatment. Therefore, we suggest that HA-JK1 can be used as a novel wound dressing material toward cutaneous wound model in vivo. This system should significantly enhance wound regeneration through the release of HS that induces the expression of  macrophage phenotype.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Microglia, as the resident immune cells, orchestrate neuroinflammation distinctly in neurological diseases with different polarization statuses. However, microglial polarizations in the neuroinflammatory responses after SAH are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of microglial reaction in an endovascular perforated SAH model. By using the Cx3cr1 Ccr2 transgenic mice, we found that the reactive immune cells were largely from resident microglia pool rather than infiltrating macrophages. Immunostaining and real-time PCR were employed to analyze the temporal microglial polarization and the resulting inflammatory responses. Our results showed that microglia accumulated immediately after SAH with a centrifugal spreading through the Cortex Adjacent to the Perforated Site (CAPS) to the remote motor cortex. Microglia polarized dynamically from M1 to  phenotype along with the morphological transformation from ramified to amoeboid shapes. The ramified microglia demonstrated the M1 property, which suggested the function-related microglial polarization occurred prior to morphological transformation after SAH. Bipolar-shaped microglia appeared as the intermediate and transitional status with the capacity of bidirectional polarization. The microglial polarization status is distinct in molecular inflammatory responses; M1-related pro- was predominant in the early phase and subsequently transited to the -related anti-. The systematic characterization of the dynamics of microglial polarization in this study contributes to the understanding of the origin of neuroinflammatory responses after SAH and provides key foundation for further investigations to develop target treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31248427>Macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL) is induced on  microglia and participates in the resolution phase of autoimmune neuroinflammation.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) involves a misdirected immune attack against myelin in the brain and spinal cord, leading to profound neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. While the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis have been widely studied, the suppression mechanisms that lead to the resolution of the autoimmune response are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of the C-type lectin receptor macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL), usually expressed on tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells (APCs), as a negative regulator of autoimmune-driven neuroinflammation.We used in silico, immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and flow cytometry analysis to explore the expression and functionality of MGL in human macrophages and microglia, as well as in MS post-mortem tissue. In vitro, we studied the capacity of MGL to mediate apoptosis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-derived T cells and mouse CD4 T cells. Finally, we evaluated in vivo and ex vivo the immunomodulatory potential of MGL in EAE.MGL plays a critical role in the resolution phase of EAE as MGL1-deficient (Clec10a) mice showed a similar day of onset but experienced a higher clinical score to that of WT littermates. We demonstrate that the mouse ortholog MGL1 induces apoptosis of autoreactive T cells and diminishes the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory autoantibodies. Moreover, we show that MGL1 but not MGL2 induces apoptosis of activated mouse CD4 T cells in vitro. In human settings, we show that MGL expression is increased in active MS lesions and on alternatively activated microglia and macrophages which, in turn, induces the secretion of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10, underscoring the clinical relevance of this lectin.Our results show a new role of MGL-expressing APCs as an anti-inflammatory mechanism in autoimmune neuroinflammation by dampening pathogenic T and B cell responses, uncovering a novel clue for neuroprotective therapeutic strategies with relevance for in MS clinical applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530089>Diversity, Mechanisms, and Significance of Macrophage Plasticity.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are a diverse set of cells present in all body compartments. This diversity is imprinted by their ontogenetic origin (embryonal versus adult bone marrow-derived cells); the organ context; the activation or deactivation of various signals in the contexts of microbial invasion, tissue damage, and metabolic derangement; and by polarization of adaptive T cell responses. Classic adaptive responses of macrophages include tolerance, priming, and a wide spectrum of activation states, including M1, , or -like. Moreover, macrophages can retain long-term imprinting of microbial encounters (trained innate immunity). Single-cell analysis of mononuclear phagocytes in health and disease has added a new dimension to our understanding of the diversity of macrophage differentiation and activation. Epigenetic landscapes, transcription factors, and microRNA networks underlie the adaptability of macrophages to different environmental cues. Macrophage plasticity, an essential component of chronic , and its involvement in diverse human diseases, most notably cancer, is discussed here as a paradigm.

Cell-based therapy is an attractive treatment method for intractable diseases in the medical and dental fields; however, approval has been challenging in dentistry. Recently, we developed quality- and quantity (QQ)-controlled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) that have anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenesis effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of QQ-controlled PBMNC transplantation on BRONJ-like lesions in mice.To create high-prevalence BRONJ-like lesions, cyclophosphamide (CY) and zoledronate (ZA) were used with tooth extraction. Drug treatment was performed for 5 weeks. QQ-controlled PBMNC transplantation was performed immediately following tooth extraction of both maxillary first molars at 3 weeks after drug administration. Mice were euthanized at 2 weeks post-extraction. Histomorphometric and immunohistochemical analyses, microcomputed tomography assessment, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction evaluation were conducted using maxillae and long bones.ZA effects on long bones were noted, regardless of CY. Severely inhibited osseous and soft tissue wound healing of tooth extraction sockets was induced by CY/ZA combination therapy, which was diagnosed as BRONJ-like lesions. QQ-controlled PBMNC transplantation reduced BRONJ-like lesions by improving soft tissue healing with increased M1 and  macrophages and enhanced neovascularization in the connective tissue of tooth extraction sockets. QQ-controlled PBMNC transplantation also reduced  by decreasing polymorphonuclear cells and TNF-α expression in the tooth extraction sockets. Additionally, QQ-controlled PBMNC transplantation partially improved osseous healing of tooth extraction sockets. Interestingly, only 20,000 QQ-controlled PBMNCs per mouse induced these transplantation effects. QQ-controlled PBMNC transplantation did not affect the systemic microenvironment.Our findings suggest that transplantation of a small amount of QQ-controlled PBMNCs may become novel therapeutic or prevention strategies for BRONJ without any adverse side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31264132>Microglial polarization: novel therapeutic mechanism against Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease that results in progressive dementia, and exhibits high disability and fatality rates. Recent evidence has demonstrated that neuroinflammation is critical in the pathophysiological processes of AD, which is characterized by the activation of microglia and astrocytes. Under different stimuli, microglia are usually activated into two polarized states, termed the classical 'M1' phenotype and the alternative '' phenotype. M1 microglia are considered to promote inflammatory injury in AD; in contrast,  microglia exert neuroprotective effects. Imbalanced microglial polarization, in the form of excessive activation of M1 microglia and dysfunction of  microglia, markedly promotes the development of AD. Furthermore, an increasing number of studies have shown that the transition of microglia from the M1 to  phenotype could potently alleviate pathological damage in AD. Hence, this article reviews the current knowledge regarding the role of microglial M1/ polarization in the pathophysiology of AD. In addition, we summarize several approaches that protect against AD by altering the polarization states of microglia. This review aims to contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AD and, moreover, to explore the potential of novel drugs for the treatment of AD in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542966>Targeted VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) Therapy Induces Long-Term Renal Recovery in Chronic Kidney Disease via Macrophage Polarization.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) universally associates with renal microvascular rarefaction and , but whether a link exists between these 2 processes is unclear. We designed a therapeutic construct of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) fused to an ELP (elastin-like polypeptide) carrier and show that it improves renal function in experimental renovascular disease. We test the hypothesis that ELP-VEGF therapy will improve CKD, and that recovery will be driven by decreasing microvascular rarefaction partly via modulation of macrophage phenotype and . CKD was induced in 14 pigs, which were observed for 14 weeks. At 6 weeks, renal blood flow and filtration were quantified using multidetector computed tomography, and then pigs received single intrarenal ELP-VEGF or placebo (n=7 each). Renal function was quantified again 4 and 8 weeks later. Pigs were euthanized and renal microvascular density, angiogenic and inflammatory markers, fibrosis, macrophage infiltration, and phenotype were quantified. Loss of renal hemodynamics in CKD was progressively recovered by ELP-VEGF therapy, accompanied by improved renal microvascular density, fibrosis, and expression of inflammatory mediators. Although renal macrophage infiltration was similar in both CKD groups, ELP-VEGF therapy distinctly shifted their phenotype from proinflammatory M1 to VEGF-expressing . Our study unravels potential mechanisms and feasibility of a new strategy to offset progression of CKD using drug-delivery technologies. The results indicate that renal recovery after ELP-VEGF therapy was largely driven by modulation of renal macrophages toward VEGF-expressing  phenotype, restoring VEGF signaling and sustaining improvement of renal function and microvascular integrity in CKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379572>Ginkgolic Acid is a Multi-Target Inhibitor of Key Enzymes in Pro-Inflammatory Lipid Mediator Biosynthesis.</a></h2><p> Lipid mediators (LMs) comprise bioactive metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids, including pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), and leukotrienes (LTs), as well as specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). They are essentially biosynthesized  cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LO) pathways in complex networks and regulate the progression as well as the resolution of inflammatory disorders including -triggered cancer. Ginkgolic acid (GA) is a phenolic acid contained in  L. with neuroprotective, antimicrobial, and antitumoral properties. Although LMs regulate microbial infections and tumor progression, whether GA affects LM biosynthesis is unknown and was investigated here in detail.  Pharmacophore-based virtual screening was performed along with docking simulations. Activity assays were conducted for isolated human recombinant 5-LO, cytosolic phospholipase (PLA)α, COX-2, and ovine COX-1. The activity of human mPGES-1 and thromboxane A synthase (TXAS) was determined in crude cellular fractions. Cellular LM formation was studied using human monocytes, neutrophils, platelets, and M1- and -like macrophages. LMs were identified after (ultra)high-performance liquid chromatography by UV detection or ESI-tandem mass spectrometry.  GA was identified as virtual hit in an mPGES-1 pharmacophore-based virtual screening. Cell-free assays revealed potent suppression of mPGES-1 activity (IC = 0.7 µM) that is fully reversible and essentially independent of the substrate concentration. Moreover, cell-free assays revealed COX-1 and TXAS as additional targets of GA with lower affinity (IC = 8.1 and 5.2 µM). Notably, 5-LO, the key enzyme in LT biosynthesis, was potently inhibited by GA (IC = 0.2 µM) in a reversible and substrate-independent manner. Docking simulations support the molecular interaction of GA with mPGES-1 and 5-LO and suggest concrete binding sites. Interestingly, interference of GA with mPGES-1, COX-1, TXAS, and 5-LO was evident also in intact cells with IC values of 2.1-3.8 µM; no radical scavenging or cytotoxic properties were obvious. Analysis of LM profiles from bacteria-stimulated human M1- and -like macrophages confirmed the multi-target features of GA and revealed LM redirection towards the formation of 12-/15-LO products including SPM.  We reveal GA as potent multi-target inhibitor of key enzymes in the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory LMs that contribute to the complex pharmacological and toxicological properties of GA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451099>Role of TLR4 (Toll-Like Receptor 4) in N1/N2 Neutrophil Programming After Stroke.</a></h2><p>Background and Purpose- After stroke, the population of infiltrated neutrophils in the brain is heterogeneous, including a population of alternative neutrophils (N2) that express  phenotype markers.

Infarct size was measured by Nissl staining and magnetic resonance imaging. Leukocyte infiltration was quantified 48 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. To elucidate mechanisms underlying TLR4-mediated N2 phenotype, a cDNA microarray analysis was performed in neutrophils isolated from blood 48 hours after stroke in WT and TLR4-KO mice. Results- As demonstrated previously, TLR4-deficient mice presented lesser infarct volumes than WT mice. TLR4-deficient mice showed higher density of infiltrated neutrophils 48 hours after stroke compared with WT mice, concomitantly to neuroprotection. Furthermore, cytometric and stereological analyses revealed an increased number of N2 neutrophils (YM1 cells) into the ischemic core in TLR4-deficient mice, suggesting a protective effect of this neutrophil subset that was corroborated by depleting peripheral neutrophils or using mice with TLR4 genetically ablated in the myeloid lineage. Finally, cDNA microarray analysis in neutrophils, confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, showed that TLR4 modulates several pathways associated with ischemia-induced , migration of neutrophils into the parenchyma, and their functional priming, which might explain the opposite effect on outcome of the different neutrophil subsets. Conclusions- TLR4 deficiency increased the levels of alternative neutrophils (N2)-an effect associated with neuroprotection after stroke-supporting that modulation of neutrophil polarization is a major target of TLR4 and highlighting the crucial role of TLR4 at the peripheral level after stroke.

In fact, during these diseases, activated macrophages may play a critical role, promoting the  as well as mediating the damage resolution. This dichotomy is referred to two end-stage phenotypes of macrophages, conventionally known as M1 and , playing a pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory role, respectively. The M1 macrophages are the mainly subset involved during inflammatory processes, producing pro-inflammatory mediators. Conversely, the  macrophages are proposed to contribute to the resolution phase of , when cells with pro-resolving property are recruited and activated. In fact, this subset of macrophages may activate regulatory T lymphocytes, which play a critical role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance and preventing the occurrence of autoimmune diseases. On these bases, the polarization toward the  phenotype could play a therapeutic role for autoimmune diseases. In this Review we discussed the characteristic of M1 and  macrophages, focusing on the immunoregulatory role of  cells and their potential ability to control the  and to promote the immunological tolerance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, NF-κB inhibition in chondrocytes failed to reverse the effect of T1D. Mechanistically, diabetes caused defective proresolving macrophage () polarization by reducing TGF-β1 expression by SSCs, which was recovered by NF-κB inhibition or exogenous TGF-β1 treatment.

The immunomodulatory properties of human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) have been studied in many disease models. We previously reported that hAECs restored ovarian function in chemotherapy-induced POF mice, but the immunomodulatory mechanism of hAECs is still unclear. To investigate the effect of hAECs on recipient mice, especially on regulatory Treg cells, hAECs and hAEC-conditioned medium (hAEC-CM) were intravenously injected into AOD mice immunized with zona pellucida protein 3 peptides (pZP3). Ovarian function was evaluated through estrous cycle, hormone secretion, follicle development, and cell apoptosis analysis. Immune cells including CD3, CD4, CD8 and Treg cells in the spleens were tested by flow cytometry. To elucidate the effect of hAEC-CM on macrophage function,  model in vitro was established in RAW264.7 cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). hAECs and hAEC-CM regulated estrous cycles, promoted follicle development, ameliorated cell apoptosis and fibrosis in ovaries of AOD mice. In addition, hAECs significantly reversed the decrease of pZP3-induced Treg cells in the spleens. In vitro, hAEC-CM significantly inhibited the inflammatory reaction induced by LPS in RAW264.7 cells via up-regulating the expression of  macrophage genes. Further study demonstrated that hAEC-secreted transforming growth factor-beta and macrophage inhibitory factor played important roles in the macrophage polarization and migration under inflammatory stimulation. Taken together, hAECs restored ovarian function by up-regulating Treg cells in the spleens and reduced the inflammatory reaction via modulating the activated macrophage function in a paracrine manner in the ovaries of AOD mice.© The Author(s) 2019.

The present study was designed to investigate the anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory and toxic activities of celastrol-loaded nanomicelles (nano-celastrol) in diet-induced obese mice. Celastrol was loaded into PEG-PCL nanoparticles, yielding nano-celastrol with optimal size, spherical morphology, good bioavailability, slower peak time and clearance in mice. Nano-celastrol (5 or 7.5 mg/kg/d of celastrol) was administered into diet-induced obese C57BL/6 N male mice for 3 weeks. As result, higher dose nano-celastrol reduced body weight and body fat mass in an equally effective manner as regular celastrol, although lower dose nano-celastrol showed less activity. Similarly, nano-celastrol improved glucose tolerance in mice equally well as regular celastrol, whereas higher dose nano-celastrol improved the response to insulin. As for macrophage M1/ polarization in liver, nano-celastrol reduced the expression of macrophage M1 biomarkers (e.g., IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, iNOS) in a dose-dependent manner and marginally increased the expression of macrophage  biomarkers (e.g., Arg-1, IL-10). Moreover, celastrol could cause anus irritation and disturb intestinal and colonic integrity, whereas nano-celastrol did not cause any injury to mice. Collectively, nano-celastrol represents a translatable therapeutic opportunity for treating diet-induced obesity in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, we evaluated the potential of these metabolites to act as predictive markers for GDM.This was a prospective study investigating overweight and obese [prepregnancy BMI (in kg/) ≥25 and >30, respectively] pregnant women (prepregnancy median BMI: 28.5; IQR: 26.4-31.5; n = 357). Fasting serum samples were analyzed with a targeted NMR approach in early pregnancy (median: 14.3 weeks of gestation). GDM was diagnosed on the basis of a 2-h, 75-g oral-glucose-tolerance test at a median of 25.7 weeks of gestation.In early pregnancy, 78 lipid metabolites differed in women who later developed GDM (n = 82) compared with those who remained healthy (n = 275) (ANCOVA, adjusted for confounding factors and corrected for multiple comparisons; false discovery rate <0.05). Higher concentrations of several-sized VLDL particles and medium- and small-sized HDL particles, and lower concentrations of very large-sized HDL particles, were detected in women developing GDM. Furthermore, concentrations of amino acids including 2 branched-chain amino acids, isoleucine and leucine, and GlycA, a marker for low-grade , were higher in women who developed GDM. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the most predictive marker for GDM was a higher concentration of small-sized HDL particles (AUC: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.77; P < 0.001).We identified a distinct early pregnancy metabolomic profile especially attributable to small HDL particles in women developing GDM.

Although most TJR recipients are elderly, studies linking wear particle-activated macrophages and peri-implant osteolysis have not taken into account the multiple effects that aging has on the innate immune system and, in particular, on macrophages. To address this, we compared the wear particle responses of bone marrow macrophages obtained from young (2-month) and aged (18-month) mice. Macrophages were polarized to M0, M1, or  phenotypes in vitro, challenged with titanium particles, and their inflammatory response was characterized at multiple time points by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, age-dependent changes in activation of transcription factor nuclear factor-κB were analyzed by a lentiviral vector-based luciferase reporter system. The particle stimulation experiment was further repeated using human primary macrophages isolated from blood donors of different ages. We found that the pro-inflammatory responses were generally higher in macrophages obtained from young mice, but differences between the age groups remained small and of uncertain biological significance. Noteworthily,  polarization effectively suppressed the particle-induced  in both young and aged macrophages. These results suggest that aging of the innate immune system per se plays no significant role in the response of macrophages to titanium particles, whereas induction of  polarization appears a promising strategy to limit macrophage-mediated  regardless of age.© 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Vacuolar (H)-ATPase (V-ATPase) is fundamental in inflammatory cytokine trafficking and secretion and was implicated in macrophage polarization toward the  phenotype, but its role in SPM production and lipid mediator biosynthesis in general is elusive. In this study, we show that V-ATPase activity is required for the induction of SPM-biosynthetic pathways in human -like monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and consequently for resolution of . Blockade of V-ATPase by archazolid during IL-4-induced human  polarization abrogated 15-lipoxygenase-1 expression and prevented the related biosynthesis of SPM in response to pathogenic , assessed by targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based metabololipidomics. In classically activated proinflammatory M1-like MDM, however, the biosynthetic machinery for lipid mediator formation was independent of V-ATPase activity. Targeting V-ATPase in  influenced neither IL-4-triggered JAK/STAT6 nor the mTOR complex 1 signaling but strongly suppressed the ERK-1/2 pathway.

Dox-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) can lead to heart failure and death. There is no study that investigates whether embryonic stem cell-derived exosomes (ES-Exos) in DIC can attenuate -induced pyroptosis, pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, inflammatory cell signaling, and adverse cardiac remodeling. For this purpose, we transplanted ES-Exos and compared with ES-cells (ESCs) to examine pyroptosis, , cell signaling, adverse cardiac remodeling, and their influence on DIC induced cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, we used C57BL/6J mice ages 10 ± 2 weeks and divided them into four groups ( = 6-8/group): Control, Dox, Dox + ESCs, and Dox + ES-Exos. Our data shows that the Dox treatment significantly increased expression of inflammasome markers (TLR4 and NLRP3), pyroptotic markers (caspase-1, IL1-β, and IL-18), cell signaling proteins (MyD88, p-P38, and p-JNK), pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, and TNF-α cytokine. This increased pyroptosis, , and cell signaling proteins were inhibited with ES-Exos or ESCs. Moreover, ES-Exos or ESCs increased  macrophages and anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Additionally, ES-Exos or ESCs treatment inhibited significantly cytoplasmic vacuolization, myofibril loss, hypertrophy, and improved heart function.

Neuroinflammation at the lesion site contributes to secondary tissue injury and permanent locomotor dysfunction. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a highly selective α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, is anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in both preclinical and clinical trials. We investigated the effect of DEX on the microglial response, and histological and neurological outcomes in a rat model of cervical spinal cord injury.Anaesthetised rats underwent unilateral (right) C5 spinal cord contusion (75 kdyne) using an impactor device. The locomotor function, injury size, and inflammatory responses were assessed. The effect of DEX was also studied in a microglial cell culture model.DEX significantly improved the ipsilateral upper-limb motor dysfunction (grooming and paw placement; P<0.0001 and P=0.0012), decreased the injury size (P<0.05), spared white matter (P<0.05), and reduced the number of activated macrophages (P<0.05) at the injury site 4 weeks post-SCI. In DEX-treated rats after injury, tissue RNA expression indicated a significant downregulation of pro-inflammatory markers (e.g. interleukin [IL]-1β, tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and CD11b) and an upregulation of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving  responses (e.g. IL-4, arginase-1, and CD206) (P<0.05). In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cultured microglia, DEX produced a similar -modulatory effect as was seen in spinal cord injury. The benefits of DEX on these outcomes were mostly reversed by an α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist.DEX significantly improves neurological outcomes and decreases tissue damage after spinal cord injury, which is associated with modulation of neuroinflammation and is partially mediated via α2-adrenergic receptor signaling.Copyright © 2019 British Journal of Anaesthesia.

We evaluated the effect of pyridoxamine on RAGE ligand accumulation and M1 polarization in the visceral, subcutaneous, and perivascular fat tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high fat diet (HFD). Pyridoxamine reduced HFD-induced weight gain, attenuated adipocyte size increases, RAGE ligand accumulations, RAGE-RAGE ligands binding, decreased macrophage M1 polarization and increased  polarization in visceral fat tissues, but not in subcutaneous tissues.

We have shown that liver injury and Ehrlichia-induced sepsis occur due to dysregulated . Here, we investigated the contribution of macrophages to Ehrlichia-induced sepsis using murine models of mild and fatal ehrlichiosis. Lethally-infected mice showed accumulation of M1 macrophages (iNOS-positive) in the liver. In contrast, non-lethally infected mice showed polarization of  macrophages and their accumulation in peritoneum, but not in the liver. Predominance of M1 macrophages in lethally-infected mice was associated with expansion of IL-17-producing T, NK, and NKT cells. Consistent with the in vivo data, infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) with lethal Ehrlichia polarized M0 macrophages into M1 phenotype under an mTORC1-dependent manner, while infection with non-lethal Ehrlichia polarized these cells into  types.

The mechanisms underlying this fibrosis are largely unknown. Because excessive polarization of  macrophages has increasingly been cited as possible inciting factor for tissue remodeling and organ fibrosis, we here hypothesize it might be involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis after high tidal volume (VT) MV. In our prospective, randomized, controlled animal study, C57BL/6 mice were randomly placed in either a VILI group or sham group. After ventilation, surviving mice were allowed to recover for 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, or 14 days. 200 mice were involved in our in vivo experiment, and the results calculated here refer only to the surviving mice. The results clearly showed that high-VT MV caused early  and a subsequent fibroproliferative response in mice without pre-existing lung disease. High-VT MV was also found to lead to a dramatic increase in the number of  macrophages in mouse bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cell and lung tissues. Consistent with the progression of fibrosis, there were far more  macrophages at the 5 day after ventilation and remained dominant for 2 weeks. High-VT MV induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) on day 7, accompanied by the increased expression of TGF-β1 and p-Smad2/3. In vitro experiments, the co-culture of  macrophage and MLE-12 cells resulted in a significant EMT and upregulation of TGF-β1 and p-Smad2/3 in MLE-12 cells. To summarize, our findings suggested the persistent tilt polarization toward  macrophages was associated with EMT during the course of ventilator-induced pulmonary fibrosis, which may play its roles through activation of epithelial TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling.Copyright © 2019.

They are found throughout the renal compartments where they contribute to homeostasis and function. However, renal injury activates molecular pathways that initially stimulate differentiation of macrophages into a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype.

The purpose of the present study is to understand the extent to which post-traumatic  following cortical lesion could influence the survival of grafted neurons and the development of their projections to target brain regions and conversely how transplanted cells can modulate host . For this, embryonic motor cortical tissue was grafted either immediately or with a 1-week delay into the lesioned motor cortex of adult mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis was performed to determine the density and cell morphology of resident and peripheral infiltrating immune cells. Then,  hybridization (ISH) was performed to analyze the distribution and temporal mRNA expression pattern of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines following cortical lesion. In parallel, we analyzed the protein expression of both M1- and -associated markers to study the M1/ balance switch. We have shown that 1-week after the lesion, the number of astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and CD45+ cells were significantly increased along with characteristics of  microglia phenotype. Interestingly, the majority of microglia co-expressed transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), an anti-inflammatory cytokine, supporting the hypothesis that microglial activation is also neuroprotective.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the Notch signaling pathway and macrophage polarization in VILI. The VILI model was established using rats. Hematoxylin‑eosin staining was used to test the lung tissue morphology. Bicinchoninic acid assay and ELISA were performed to detect protein and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α, interleukin (IL)‑6, IL‑10 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF), respectively. The ratio of alveolar M1 and  macrophages was detected by flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Notch pathway‑related proteins were determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blotting. The present study found that high‑frequency mechanical ventilation could cause pulmonary edema and increase the levels of protein, TNF‑α and IL‑6 in BALF while decreasing the level of IL‑10 in BALF. High‑frequency mechanical ventilation also induced polarization of alveolar macrophages to M1. The results also showed a significant increase in the levels of Notch pathway‑related proteins including notch intracellular domain, Hes1, Hes5 and Hey1. Injection of N‑[N‑(3,5‑difluorophenylacetyl)‑1‑alanyl] phenylglycine t‑butyl ester could inhibit the Notch pathway and such an inhibition protected lung tissue and reduced lung  caused by mechanical ventilation. After the Notch pathway was inhibited, the level of M1 polarization of macrophages caused by high‑frequency mechanical ventilation was reduced.

The pathology of adipose tissue was observed by H&E staining. The rates of iNKT cells, macrophages and cell subsets in adipose tissue were detected by FCM. Cytokine levels in serum and adipose tissue lymphocyte-stimulated supernatants were assessed with the CBA kit. The expression levels of related transcription factor in adipose tissue were detected by Western blot.The proportions of iNKT cells, iNKT10 cells and  macrophages were decreased, while those of iNKT1 and M1 macrophages were increased in adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice. The expression levels of the related transcriptional proteins E4BP4 and Arg-1 were decreased while iNOS expression was increased in adipose tissue. Administration of α-GalCer by subcutaneous injection resulted in increased rates of iNKT10 cells and  macrophages, and decreased amounts of M1 macrophages in adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice. The expression of E4BP4 and Arg-1 were up-regulated, but iNOS was down-regulated. Meanwhile, infiltration of inflammatory cells into adipose tissue was further reduced.The imbalance between the proportions of iNKT1 and iNKT10 cells may be involved in the development of chronic  in obese adipose tissue.

Forty-one subjects (53-76 yr) scheduled for TKA were randomized into two groups, ingesting 20 g of EAAs or placebo, twice-daily, for 7 days before TKA and for 6 wk after surgery. A first set of muscle biopsies was obtained from both legs before surgery in the operating room, and patients were randomly assigned and equally allocated to have two additional biopsies at either 1 or 2 wk after surgery. Biopsies were processed for gene expression and immunohistochemistry. Satellite cells were significantly higher in patients ingesting 20 g of essential amino acids twice daily for the 7 days leading up to surgery compared with Placebo (operative leg  = 0.03 for satellite cells/fiber and  = 0.05 for satellite cell proportions for Type I-associated cells and  = 0.05 for satellite cells/fiber for Type II-associated cells.) Myogenic regulatory factor gene expression was different between groups, with the Placebo Group having elevated MyoD expression at 1 wk and EAAs having elevated myogenin expression at 1 wk. M1 macrophages were more prevalent in Placebo than the EAAs Group. IL-6 and TNF-α transcripts were elevated postsurgery in both groups; however, TNF-α declined by 2 wk in the EAAs Group. EAAs starting 7 days before surgery increased satellite cells on the day of surgery and promoted a more favorable inflammatory environment postsurgery. Clinical studies by our group indicate that the majority of muscle atrophy after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in older adults occurs rapidly, within the first 2 wks. We have also shown that essential amino acid supplementation (EAAs) before and after TKA mitigates muscle atrophy; however, the mechanisms are unknown. These results suggest that satellite cell numbers are elevated with EAA ingestion before surgery, and after surgery, EAA ingestion positively influences markers of . Combined, these data may help inform further studies designed to address the accelerated sarcopenia that occurs in older adults after major surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278904>Cutaneous Wound Healing in Diabetic Mice Is Improved by Topical Mineralocorticoid Receptor Blockade.</a></h2><p>Skin ulcers resulting from impaired wound healing are a serious complication of diabetes. Unresolved , associated with the dysregulation of both the phenotype and function of macrophages, is involved in the poor healing of diabetic wounds. Here, we report that topical pharmacological inhibition of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) by canrenoate or MR small interfering RNA can resolve  to improve delayed skin wound healing in diabetic mouse models; importantly, wounds from normal mice are unaffected. The beneficial effect of canrenoate is associated with an increased ratio of anti-inflammatory  macrophages to proinflammatory M1 macrophages in diabetic wounds. Furthermore, we show that MR blockade leads to downregulation of the MR target, LCN2, which may facilitate macrophage polarization toward the  phenotype and improve impaired angiogenesis in diabetic wounds. Indeed, diabetic LCN2-deficient mice showed improved wound healing associated with macrophage  polarization and angiogenesis. In addition, recombinant LCN2 protein prevented IL-4-induced macrophage switch from M1 to  phenotype. In conclusion, topical MR blockade accelerates skin wound healing in diabetic mice via LCN2 reduction,  macrophage polarization, prevention of , and induction of angiogenesis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The phagocytosis of muscle cell debris induces a switch of pro-inflammatory macrophages into an anti-inflammatory phenotype, but the cellular receptors mediating this phagocytosis are still unclear. In this paper, we report novel roles for SRB1 (scavenger receptor class BI) in regulating macrophage phagocytosis and macrophage phenotypic transitions for skeletal muscle regeneration. In a mouse model of cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury/regeneration, infiltrated macrophages expressed a high level of SRB1. Using SRB1 knockout mice, we observed the impairment of muscle regeneration along with decreased myogenin expression and increased matrix deposit. Bone marrow transplantation experiments indicated that SRB1 deficiency in bone marrow cells was responsible for impaired muscle regeneration. Compared with WT mice, SRB1 deficiency increased pro-inflammatory macrophage number and pro-inflammatory gene expression and decreased anti-inflammatory macrophage number and anti-inflammatory gene expression in injured muscle. , SRB1 deficiency led to a strong decrease in macrophage phagocytic activity on myoblast debris. SRB1-deficient macrophages easily acquired an M1 phenotype and failed to acquire an  phenotype in lipopolysaccharide/myoblast debris activation. Furthermore, SRB1 deficiency promoted activation of ERK1/2 MAPK signaling in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide/myoblast debris. Taken together, SRB1 in macrophages regulates phagocytosis and promotes M1 switch into  macrophages, contributing to muscle regeneration.© 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323531>MCP-induced protein 1 attenuates sepsis-induced acute lung injury by modulating macrophage polarization via the JNK/c-Myc pathway.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is a potentially fatal systemic inflammatory response syndrome caused by infection. In this study, we evaluated the effects of MCP-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1), a recently discovered -related ribonuclease, on sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Cecal ligation puncture and lipopolysaccharide induction were performed on Sprague-Dawley rats and RAW264.7 cells, respectively, to establish sepsis-induced ALI models. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 used as an activator of MCPIP1 overexpression, and we showed that MG132 can indeed increase the expression of MCPIP1. MCPIP1 overexpression induced by MG132 alleviated sepsis-induced pathologic changes, water content and protein leakage in the lungs, and induction of systemic inflammatory mediators, and improved the 7-day mortality rate in the model rats. We also showed that MCPIP1 p showed romoted macrophage polarization from the M1 to the  type in sepsis-induced ALI. Furthermore, MCPIP1-enhanced  polarization was inhibited by an MCPIP1-targeting small interfering RNA (siMCPIP1) in RAW264.7 cells. Further mechanistic studies showed that the promotive effect of MCPIP1 on  polarization was related to the inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its downstream transcription factor c-Myc in the in vitro model. Conversely, siMCPIP1 transfection resulted in the recovery of JNK and c-Myc expression in LPS-treated cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that MCPIP1 plays a protective role in sepsis-induced ALI by modulating macrophage polarization through inhibition of the JNK/c-Myc signaling pathway. Our study presents a potentially novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung injury involving the inflammatory cascade.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Angiogenesis is initiated by the detachment of pericytes (PCs) from vessels in AT. This process is necessary for the development of AT in obesity. The detachment is caused by excessive platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) derived from M1-macrophages (Mφ) infiltrating obese AT. On the other hand, AT of tamoxifen-induced systemic PDGF receptor-β knockout mice showed decreased detachment of PCs from vessels in obesity, thereby attenuating hypertrophy of AT mediated by neoangiogenesis, resulting in protection from the development of chronic AT  and systemic insulin resistance. The selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) inhibitor eplerenone (Ep) suppresses chronic  in fat and the liver, improves glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibits body weight and fat mass gain in mice fed a high-fat diet. As a novel mechanism, Ep increases energy expenditure and suppresses fat accumulation, thereby controlling the polarity of visceral AT Mφ from inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory  dominant. In addition, Ep directly inhibits the activation of signals 1 and 2 of NLRP3-inflammasomes in Mφ, which is an inflammatory mechanism closely involved in the development of NASH. Thus, we propose novel therapeutic approaches to NASH. Inhibition of PDGF receptor-β signaling prevents AT hypertrophy by regulating AT angiogenesis, and MR inhibitors directly suppress chronic  in the AT and liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31333642>The Metabolic Signature of Macrophage Responses.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are a heterogeneous population of immune cells playing several and diverse functions in homeostatic and immune responses. The broad spectrum of macrophage functions depends on both heterogeneity and plasticity of these cells, which are highly specialized in sensing the microenvironment and modify their properties accordingly. Although it is clear that macrophage phenotypes are difficult to categorize and should be seen as plastic and adaptable, they can be simplified into two extremes: a pro-inflammatory (M1) and an anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving () profile. Based on this definition, M1 macrophages are able to start and sustain inflammatory responses, secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, activating endothelial cells, and inducing the recruitment of other immune cells into the inflamed tissue; on the other hand,  macrophages promote the resolution of , phagocytose apoptotic cells, drive collagen deposition, coordinate tissue integrity, and release anti-inflammatory mediators. Dramatic switches in cell metabolism accompany these phenotypic and functional changes of macrophages. In particular, M1 macrophages rely mainly on glycolysis and present two breaks on the TCA cycle that result in accumulation of itaconate (a microbicide compound) and succinate. Excess of succinate leads to Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1α (HIF1α) stabilization that, in turn, activates the transcription of glycolytic genes, thus sustaining the glycolytic metabolism of M1 macrophages. On the contrary,  cells are more dependent on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), their TCA cycle is intact and provides the substrates for the complexes of the electron transport chain (ETC). Moreover, pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages are characterized by specific pathways that regulate the metabolism of lipids and amino acids and affect their responses. All these metabolic adaptations are functional to support macrophage activities as well as to sustain their polarization in specific contexts. The aim of this review is to discuss recent findings linking macrophage functions and metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271882>Plasma deposited poly-oxazoline nanotextured surfaces dictate osteoimmunomodulation towards ameliorative osteogenesis.</a></h2><p>Developing "osteoimmune-smart" bone substitute materials have become the forefront of research in bone regeneration. Biocompatible polymer coatings are applied widely to improve the bioactivity of bone substitute materials. In this context, polyoxazolines (Pox) have attracted substantial attention recently due to properties such as biocompatibility, stability, and low biofouling. In view of these useful properties, it is interesting to explore the capacity of Pox as an osteoimmunomodulatory agent to generate a favorable osteoimmune environment for osteogenesis. We applied a technique called plasma polymerization and succeeded in preparing Pox-like coatings (Ppox) and engineered their nanotopography at the nanoscale. We found that Ppox switched macrophages towards  extreme, thus inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines. The underlying mechanism may be related to the suppression of TLR pathway. The generated osteoimmune environment improved osteogenesis while inhibited osteoclastogenesis. This may be related to the release of osteogenic factors, especially Wnt10b from macrophages. The addition of nanotopography (16 nm, 38 nm, 68 nm) can tune the Ppox-mediated inhibition on  and osteoclastic activities, while no significant effects were observed within the tested nano sizes on the Ppox-mediated osteogenesis. These results collectively suggest that Ppox can be useful as an effective osteoiumunomodulatory agent to endow bone substitute materials with favourable osteoimmunomodulatory property. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we succeeded in preparing plasma deposited Pox-like nano-coatings (Ppox) via plasma polymerization and found that Ppox nanotopographies are useful osteoimmunomodulatory tools. Their osteoimmunodolatory effects and underlying mechanisms are unveiled. It is the first investigation into the feasibility of applying poly-oxazoline as an osteoimmunomodulatory agent.

In chronic , Gal-3 is associated with fibrotic events, regulates B cell differentiation and delays lupus progression. Gal-3 deficient mice (Lgals3) have intense germinal center formation and atypical plasma cell generation correlated to high levels IgG, IgE, and IgA. Here, we used pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane) to induce lupus-like syndrome in Lgals3 and Lgals3 BALB/c mice. Mesentery and peritoneal cells were monitored because promptly react to pristane injected in the peritoneal cavity. For the first time, mesenteric tissues have been associated to the pathogenesis of experimental lupus-like syndrome. In Lgals3 pristane-induced mice, mesentery was hallmarked by intense fibrogranulomatous reaction restricted to submesothelial regions and organized niches containing macrophages and B lymphocytes and plasma cells. In contrast, Lgals3 pristane-treated mice had diffuse mesenteric fibrosis affecting submesothelium and peripheral tissues, atypical M1/ macrophage polarization and significant DLL1 cells expansion, suggesting possible involvement of Notch/Delta pathways in the disease. Early inflammatory reaction to pristane was characterized by significant disturbances on monocyte recruitment, macrophage differentiation and dendritic cell (DC) responses in the peritoneal cavity of pristane-induced Lgals3 mice. A correlative analysis showed that mesenteric damages in the absence of Gal-3 were directly associated with severe portal  and hepatitis. In conclusion, it has suggested that Gal-3 orchestrates histological organization in the mesentery and prevents lupoid hepatitis in experimental lupus-like syndrome by controlling macrophage polarization, Notch signaling pathways and DC differentiation in mesenteric structures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31272031>Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids modulate adipose secretome and is associated with changes in mammary epithelial stem cell self-renewal.</a></h2><p>Chronic low-grade adipose , characterized by aberrant adipokine production and pro-inflammatory macrophage activation/polarization is associated with increased risk of breast cancer. Adipocyte fatty acid composition is influenced by dietary availability and may regulate adipokine secretion and adipose . After feeding F344 rats for 20 weeks with a Western diet or a fish oil-supplemented diet, we cultured primary rat adipose tissue in a three-dimensional explant culture and collected the conditioned medium. The rat adipose tissue secretome was assayed using the Proteome Profiler Cytokine XL Array, and adipose tissue macrophage polarization (M1/ ratio) was assessed using the iNOS/ARG1 ratio. We then assessed the adipokine's effects upon stem cell self-renewal using primary human mammospheres from normal breast mammoplasty tissue. Adipose from rats fed the fish oil diet had an ω-3:ω-6 fatty acid ratio of 0.28 compared to 0.04 in Western diet rats. The adipokine profile from the fish oil-fed rats was shifted toward adipokines associated with reduced  compared to the rats fed the Western diet. The M1/ macrophage ratio decreased by 50% in adipose of fish oil-fed rats compared to that from rats fed the Western diet. Conditioned media from rats fed the high ω-6 Western diet increased stem cell self-renewal by 62%±9% (X¯%±SD) above baseline compared to only an 11%±11% increase with the fish oil rat adipose.

Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), an anti-inflammatory lipid, mediates atheroprotective effects. We investigated how CLA alters monocyte/macrophage phenotype during attenuated progression and regression of atherosclerosis. Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE) mice were fed a high-fat (60%) high-cholesterol (1%) diet (HFHCD) for 2 wk, followed by 6-wk 1% CLA 80:20 supplementation to investigate disease progression. Simultaneously, ApoE mice were fed a 12-wk HFHCD with/without CLA for the final 4 wk to investigate regression. Aortic lesions were quantified by  staining. Proteomic analysis, real-time quantitative PCR and flow cytometry were used to interrogate monocyte/macrophage phenotypes. CLA supplementation inhibited atherosclerosis progression coincident with decreased proinflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory macrophages. However, CLA-induced regression was associated with increased proinflammatory monocytes resulting in increased proresolving  bone marrow-derived macrophages, splenic macrophages, and dendritic cells in lesion-draining lymph nodes. Proteomic analysis confirmed regulation of a proinflammatory bone marrow response, which was abolished upon macrophage differentiation. Thus, in attenuation and regression of atherosclerosis, regardless of the monocyte signature, during monocyte to macrophage differentiation, proresolving macrophages prevail, mediating vascular repair.

Recently, we reported that ANXA1 is associated with aggressive features of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); however, its clinical relevance remains controversial. We hypothesized that human TNBC with high expression of ANXA1 mRNA is associated with pro-cancerous immune cell infiltration, including mast cells, and with an aggressive phenotype. Clinical and RNA-seq data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA,  = 1079) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) ( = 1904). TNBC patients had significantly higher levels of ANXA1 expression compared to the other subtypes in both TCGA and METABRIC cohorts ( < 0.001). ANXA1 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in Japanese TNBC patient cohort ( = 48), where 17 cases (35.4%) had positive ANXA1 staining, and their overall survival was significantly shorter compared with negative staining group ( = 0.008). The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to calculate immune cell infiltrations. ANXA1 high tumors were associated with activated mast cells and  macrophages ( > 0.01), but did not show any association with tumor heterogeneity nor cytolytic activity. High expression of ANXA1 group enriched , epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and angiogenesis-related genes in a gene set enrichment assay in both cohorts.

Reduction or absence of GDAP1 has been associated with abnormal changes in the mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, oxidative stress and changes in calcium homeostasis. Neuroinflammation has been described in rodent models of genetic demyelinating CMT neuropathies but not in CMT primarily associated with axonopathy. Inflammatory processes have also been related to mitochondrial changes and oxidative stress in central neurodegenerative disorders. Here we investigated the presence of neuroinflammation in the axonal neuropathy of the Gdap1 mice. We showed by transcriptome profile of spinal cord and the in vivo detection of activated phagocytes that the absence of GDAP1 is associated with upregulation of inflammatory pathways. We observed reactive gliosis in spinal cord with increase of the astroglia markers GFAP and S100B, and the microglia marker IBA1. Additionally, we found significant increase of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and pERK, and C1qa and C1qb proteins of the complement system. Importantly, we observed an increased expression of CD206 and CD86 as  and M1 microglia and macrophage response markers, respectively, in Gdap1 mice. These inflammatory changes were also associated with abnormal molecular changes in synapses. In summary, we demonstrate that  in spinal cord and sciatic nerve, but not in brain and cerebellum, is part of the pathophysiology of axonal GDAP1-related CMT.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies have proposed metabolic disorders can be attenuated by counteracting certain inflammatory signal pathways. In this study, we examined whether intervention with G31P, an antagonist of CXCL8, could attenuate tissue  and development of metabolic disorders in db/db mice. The db/m and db/db mice were injected with G31P or equivalent normal saline for six weeks. The physical and metabolic parameters, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, hepatic lipid accumulation, and  markers were measured.

M1 macrophages are thought to be tumoricidal, but some studies report its pro-tumor role. The programmed cell death-ligand (PD-L) 1 expressed in HCC cells is a critical checkpoint molecule to mediate immune escape of HCC. The PD-L1 expression in HCC cells is inducible. In the present study, we ask whether M1 macrophages induce the expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells. First, an association between M1 macrophage infiltration and PD-L1 expression in HCC tissues was determined by bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry experiments. The enrichment score of M1 macrophages was correlated to PD-L1 expression in 90 HCC samples from GEO database. Besides, infiltration of CD68+HLA-DR+ M1-like macrophages correlated with PD-L1 expression level in HCC cells. Moreover, M1-conditioned media was prepared from M1 macrophages derived from THP-1 cell, RAW264.7 cell or murine bone marrow. These supernatants induced expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in the supernatants was identified to account for the inducible PD-L1 expression by siRNA assay and receptor blockade assay. Additionally, transcription factor p65 and IRF1 in the HCC cells were revealed by CHIP assay to mediate the inducible PD-L1 expression.

However, the expression of Arrb2 in microglial cells and its influence on HSE prognosis is still undefined. We explore the pathophysiological effect of Arrb2 in the brain using experimental HSE mice. The expression of Arrb2 in microglia was decreased significantly 48 hours following HSV-1 infection. Arrb2 overexpression transgenic (TG) mice had a significantly lower mortality and survival rate was improved by 40% compared to wild-type mice. Arrb2 suppressed the generation of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4 expression. Arrb2 also inhibited the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB in microglial cells. Arrb2 TG mice attenuated the blood-brain barrier breakdown and relieved cerebral edema, meanwhile, Arrb2 improved mice neurological function compared with wild-type mice.

The attenuated nociception comes along with a strongly reduced paw edema, indicating that peripheral antiinflammatory mechanisms contribute to antinociception. In this study, we investigated the impact of AICAR on the immune cell composition in inflamed paws, as well as the regulation of inflammatory and resolving markers in macrophages. By using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and immunofluorescence, we found a significantly increased fraction of proresolving  macrophages and anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10 in inflamed tissue, while M1 macrophages and proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 were decreased by AICAR in wild type mice. In AMPKα2 knock-out mice, the  polarization of macrophages in the paw was missing. The results were supported by experiments in primary macrophage cultures which also showed a shift to a proresolving phenotype with decreased levels of proinflammatory mediators and increased levels of antiinflammatory mediators. However, in the cell cultures, we did not observe differences between the AMPKα2+/+ and -/- cells, thus indicating that the AICAR-induced effects are at least partially AMPK-independent.

Further RNA-seq and phosphoproteomic analysis and in vitro validation assays indicated that Dasatinib exerted a marked inhibition on the proliferation and activation of PSCs, which may be resulted from increased GSK3β-mediated β-catenin cytosol retention by inhibiting upstream multiple TKs (such as PDGFR and Src) and MAPK cascades (including ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK). In addition, Dasatinib significantly restrained both the M1 and  polarization of macrophages, and impeded its recruitment and crosstalk with PSCs. Our findings indicated that Dasatinib is a potential anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapeutic strategy for CP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Mechanistic researches demonstrate that the anti-diabetic effect of MSCs is partially mediated by eliciting macrophages into an anti-inflammatory phenotype thus alleviating insulin resistance. However, single MSC infusion is insufficient to ameliorate sustained hyperglycemia or normalize blood glucose levels. In this study, we used decitabine (DAC), which is involved in the regulation of macrophage polarization, to test whether MSCs combined with decitabine can prolong and enhance the anti-diabetic effect in T2D mice.High-fat diet (HFD) and streptozocin (STZ) were given to induce T2D mouse model. Successfully induced T2D mice were randomly divided into four groups: T2D group, MSC group, DAC group, and MSC + DAC group. Blood glucose was monitored, and glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were evaluated during the entire analysis period. Epididymal fat was extracted for analysis of macrophage phenotype and  in adipose tissue. In vitro, we examined the effect of MSC + DAC on macrophage polarization in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and explore the possible mechanism.MSC infusion effectively improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in T2D mice within 1 week, whereas combination therapy of MSCs + DAC extended the anti-diabetic effects of MSCs from 1 to 4 weeks (the end of the observation). Correspondingly, more  macrophages in adipose tissue were observed in the combination therapy group over the entire study period. In vitro, compared with the MSC group, MSCs combined with decitabine more effectively polarized M1 macrophages to  macrophages. Further analysis showed that the effect of MSC + DAC on macrophage polarization was largely abrogated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist GW9662.Our data suggest that MSCs combined with decitabine can more effectively alleviate insulin resistance and prolong and enhance the anti-diabetic effect of MSCs in T2D mice in part by prompting  polarization in a PPARγ-dependent manner. Thus, decitabine may be an applicable addition to MSCs for diabetes therapy. UC-MSCs combined with decitabine activate the IL4R/STAT6/STAT3/PPARγ axis to further promote  macrophage polarization in adipose tissue, reduce , improve insulin sensitivity, and lead to better glucose metabolism and long-term hypoglycemic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611920>Mesenchymal Stem Cells Alleviate DHEA-Induced Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) by Inhibiting  in Mice.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility in women of reproductive age. Chronic  is considered to be the cause of ovarian dysfunction. Increasing evidence in animal studies and in preliminary clinical trials has demonstrated that MSCs possess immunomodulatory effects via their interaction with immune cells. However, their contribution to PCOS remains unclear. In this study, we showed that the administration of hUC-MSCs could efficiently improve the pathological changes of PCOS mice induced by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), including ovarian histopathology and function. Moreover, we found that the administration of MSCs significantly downregulated the expression of proinflammatory factors (TNF-, IL-1, and IFN-) and fibrosis-related genes (CTGF) in ovarian and uterus tissues and affected the systemic inflammatory response. The percentage of peripheral neutrophils, M1 macrophages, and B cells was significantly reduced, while  macrophages and regulatory T cells (Tregs) were increased in hUC-MSC-treated mice. In the spleen, the percentage of neutrophils, M1 macrophages, IFN- CD19B cell, IFN- CD4T cells (Th1), and IL-17CD4T cells (Th17) was significantly decreased in hUC-MSC-treated mice. These results suggested that hUC-MSC treatment could alleviate ovarian dysfunction by inhibiting ovarian local and systemic inflammatory responses.Copyright © 2019 Qi Xie et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285187>Treatment of obesity-related  with a novel synthetic pentacyclic oleanane triterpenoids via modulation of macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Obesity leads to the chronic  in the whole body and triggers the macrophage polarization to the pro-inflammatory phenotype. Targeting macrophage polarization provides a promising therapeutic strategy for obesity-related metabolic disorders and .

Despite over a century of research, aspirin/SA's mechanism(s) of action is still only partially understood. Here we report the results of a genome-wide, high-throughput screen to identify potential SA-binding proteins (SABPs) in human HEK293 cells. Following photo-affinity crosslinking to 4-azidoSA and immuno-selection with an anti-SA antibody, approximately 2,000 proteins were identified. Among these, 95 were enriched more than 10-fold. Pathway enrichment analysis with these 95 candidate SABPs (cSABPs) revealed possible involvement of SA in multiple biological pathways, including (i) glycolysis, (ii) cytoskeletal assembly and/or signaling, and (iii) NF-κB-mediated immune signaling. The two most enriched cSABPs, which corresponded to the glycolytic enzymes alpha-enolase (ENO1) and pyruvate kinase isozyme  (PKM2), were assessed for their ability to bind SA and SA's more potent derivative amorfrutin B1 (amoB1). SA and amoB1 bound recombinant ENO1 and PKM2 at low millimolar and micromolar concentrations, respectively, and inhibited their enzymatic activities in vitro. Consistent with these results, low millimolar concentrations of SA suppressed glycolytic activity in HEK293 cells.

To get further insight on their role during chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections, our aim was to phenotypically and functionally characterize in vivo and ex vivo the interplay between HBV, primary human liver macrophages (PLMs) and primary blood monocytes differentiated into pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory macrophages (M1-MDMs or -MDMs, respectively).PLMs or primary blood monocytes, either ex vivo differentiated into M1-MDMs or -MDMs, were exposed to HBV and their activation followed by ELISA or quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Liver biopsies from HBV-infected patients were analysed by RT-qPCR or immunohistochemistry. Viral parameters in HBV-infected primary human hepatocytes and differentiated HepaRG cells were followed by ELISA, qPCR and RT-qPCR analyses.HBc protein was present within the macrophages of liver biopsies taken from HBV-infected patients. Macrophages from HBV-infected patients also expressed higher levels of anti-inflammatory macrophage markers than those from non-infected patients. Ex vivo exposure of naive PLMs to HBV led to reduced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Upon exposure to HBV or HBV-producing cells during differentiation and activation, M1-MDMs secreted less IL-6 and IL-1β, whereas -MDMs secreted more IL-10 when exposed to HBV during activation. Finally, cytokines produced by M1-MDMs, but not those produced by HBV-exposed M1-MDMs, decreased HBV infection of hepatocytes.Altogether, our data strongly suggest that HBV modulates liver macrophage functions to favour the establishment of infection.Hepatitis B virus modulates liver macrophage function in order to favour the establishment and likely maintenance of infection. It impairs the production of the antiviral cytokine IL-1β, while promoting that of IL-10 in the microenvironment. This phenotype can be recapitulated in naive liver macrophages or monocyte-derived-macrophages ex vivo by short exposure to the virus or cells replicating the virus, thus suggesting an "easy to implement" mechanism of inhibition.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

WSD-induced adipose  might result from endoplasmic reticulum stress in lipid-overloaded adipocytes and/or dissemination of gut bacterial products, resulting in activation of innate immune signaling. Hence, we aimed to investigate the role of the gut microbiota, and its detection by innate immune signaling pathways, in WSD-induced adipose .Mice were fed grain-based chow or a WSD for 8 weeks, assessed metabolically, and intestinal and adipose tissue were analyzed by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Microbiota was ablated via antibiotics and use of gnotobiotic mice that completely lacked microbiota (germ-free mice) or had a low-complexity microbiota (altered Schaedler flora). Innate immune signaling was ablated by genetic deletion of Toll-like receptor signaling adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response 88.Ablation of microbiota via antibiotic, germ-free, or altered Schaedler flora approaches did not significantly impact WSD-induced adiposity, yet dramatically reduced WSD-induced adipose  as assessed by macrophage populations and cytokine expression.

In order to study their cytotoxicity usually bone cells are used. However, after implantation, diverse and versatile cells are recruited and interact. Among the first ones coming into play are cells of the immune system, which are responsible for the inflammatory reaction. Macrophages play a central role in the inflammatory process due to the production of cytokines involved in the tissue healing but also in the possible failure of the implants. In order to evaluate the in vitro influence of the degradation products of magnesium-based alloys on cytokine release, the extracts of pure magnesium and two magnesium alloys (with gadolinium and silver as alloying elements) were examined in an inflammatory in vitro model. Human promonocytic cells (U937 cells) were differentiated into macrophages and further cultured with magnesium-based extracts for 1 and 3 days (simulating early and late inflammatory reaction phases), either at 37 °C or at 39 °C (mimicking normal and inflammatory conditions, respectively). All extracts exhibit very good cytocompatibility on differentiated macrophages. Results suggest that M1 and even more  profiles of macrophage were stimulated by the extracts of Mg. Furthermore, Mg-10Gd and Mg-2Ag extracts introduced a nuancing effect by rather inhibiting macrophage M1 profile. Magnesium-based biomaterials could thus induce a faster  resolution while improving tissue repair. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Macrophage are the key-cells during  and can influence the fate of tissue healing and implant performance. Magnesium-based implants are biodegradable and bioactive. Here we selected an in vitro system to model early and late  and effect of pyrexia (37 °C versus 39 °C). We showed the beneficial and nuancing effects of magnesium (Mg) and the selected alloying elements (silver (Ag) and gadolinium (Gd)) on the macrophage polarisation. Mg extracts exacerbated simultaneously the macrophage M1 and  profiles while Mg-2Ag and Mg-10Gd rather inhibited the M1 differentiation. Furthermore, 39 °C exhibited protective effect by either decreasing cytokine production or promoting anti-inflammatory ones, with or without extracts. Mg-based biomaterials could thus induce a faster  resolution while improving tissue repair.Copyright © 2019.

Formyl peptide receptor 2 (Fpr2) is a G protein-coupled receptor that modulates  and host defense by regulating the activation of inflammatory cells, such as macrophages. However, the role of Fpr2 in the development and therapy of scleroderma is still unclear. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of Fpr2 activation in the treatment of scleroderma fibrosis. We found that intradermal administration of WKYMVm, an Fpr2-specific agonist, alleviated bleomycin-induced scleroderma fibrosis in mice and decreased dermal thickness in scleroderma skin. WKYMVm-treated scleroderma skin tissues displayed reduced numbers of myofibroblasts expressing α-smooth muscle actin, Vimentin, and phosphorylated SMAD3. WKYMVm treatment attenuated macrophage infiltration in scleroderma skin and reduced the number of  macrophages. The therapeutic effects of WKYMVm in scleroderma-associated fibrosis and  were completely abrogated in Fpr2 knockout mice. Moreover, WKYMVm treatment reduced the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ, in the scleroderma model of wild-type mice but not in Fpr2 knockout mice.

Human amniotic mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSCs) are newly identified mesenchymal stem cells and have been shown to have an immunoregulatory ability for multiple autoimmune diseases.Mice were intraperitoneally injected with Acetaminophen (APAP) to establish a liver injury model. hAMSCs were injected through the tail vein, and the liver function was observed through a liver function and pathology analysis. To test the regulative ability of hAMSCs , the supernatant of hAMSCs were collected and co-cultured with Kupffer cells (KCs). Liposome was used to abolish the function of KCs .Infusion of hAMSCs reduced the level of liver function injury and  expression in APAP-induced liver injury. hAMSCs markedly promoted  polarization of KCs instead of M1 polarization . Furthermore, the mechanism study also proved that hAMSCs reduced autophagy, as revealed by down-regulated LC3B-II levels. The elimination of KCs  abolished the protective ability of hAMSCs in liver injury, which resulted in a significant increase of liver pathogenesis along with an increase in alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) levels.Our results proved that hAMSCs suppressed M1 polarization and promoted  polarization of KCs through regulating autophagy in the model of APAP-treated livers.

The APPs were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and their concentrations were determined by computerized densitometry. Protein identification was performed using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Nine APPs were identified: α2-macroglobulin, ceruloplasmin, transferrin, albumin, α1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin, α1-acid glycoprotein, apolipoprotein A1, and serum amyloid A. Ceruloplasmin (Cp) presented an elevation at M0 in G2 in relation to G1 and the control group (CG). Serum amyloid A (SAA) presented an elevation with a difference at M3 in G1 and G2, compared with CG. In the comparison between the time points within each group (G1 and G2), there was an increase in SAA in G2 with a difference at M1, , and M3. Cp and SAA were suitable for evaluating the acute-phase response in horses with colic. Cp was an indicator of colic with surgical resolution. SAA presented favorable behavior for its use as a biomarker to establish the prognosis in horses with colic. The serial measurement of these proteins was useful in differentiating the clinical or surgical treatment and prognosis of horses with this disorder.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

While there have been significant advances in current therapies, mortality and morbidity remain high. Emphasis on  and extracellular matrix remodeling as key pathological factors has brought to light new potential therapeutic targets including macrophages which are central players in the inflammatory response following myocardial infarction. Blood derived and tissue resident macrophages exhibit both a pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotype, essential for removing injured tissue and facilitating repair, respectively. Sustained activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages evokes extensive remodeling of cardiac tissue through secretion of matrix proteases and activation of myofibroblasts. As the heart continues to employ methods of remodeling and repair, a destructive cycle prevails ultimately leading to deterioration of cardiac function and heart failure. This review summarizes not only the traditionally accepted role of macrophages in the heart but also recent advances that have deepened our understanding and appreciation of this dynamic cell. We discuss the role of macrophages in normal and maladaptive matrix remodeling, as well as studies to date which have aimed to target the inflammatory response in combatting excessive matrix deposition and subsequent heart failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481754>CCL5 deficiency promotes liver repair by improving  resolution and liver regeneration through  macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Despite the diverse etiologies of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), innate immunity activation is a common feature involved in DILI progression. However, the involvement of innate immunity regulation in  resolution and liver regeneration in DILI remains obscure. Herein, we identified the chemokine CCL5 as a central mediator of innate immunity regulation in the pathogenesis of DILI. First, we showed that serum and hepatic CCL5 levels are elevated in both DILI patients and an APAP-induced liver injury (AILI) mouse model. Interestingly, both nonparenchymal cells and stressed hepatocytes are cell sources of CCL5 induction in response to liver injury. Functional experiments showed that CCL5 deficiency has no effect on the early phase of AILI but promotes liver repair in the late phase mainly by promoting  resolution and liver regeneration, which are associated with an increased number of hepatic  macrophages. Mechanistically, CCL5 can directly activate M1 polarization and impede  polarization through the CCR1- and CCR5-mediated activation of the MAPK and NF-κB pathways. We then showed that CCL5 inhibition mediated by either a CCL5-neutralizing antibody or the antagonist Met-CCL5 can greatly alleviate liver injury and improve survival in an AILI mouse model. Our data demonstrate CCL5 induction during DILI, identify CCL5 as a novel innate immunity regulator in macrophage polarization, and suggest that CCL5 blockage is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of DILI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344653>Dendritic cells and  macrophage play an important role in suppression of Th2-mediated  by adipose stem cells-derived extracellular vesicles.</a></h2><p>Although stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to facilitate regeneration of injured tissue, there is no report that evaluates the immune-modulating effect of stem cell-derived EVs on Th2-mediated . In this study, we evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of adipose stem cells (ASCs)-derived EVs on Th2-mediated  induced by Aspergillus protease antigen in lung epithelial cells. The EVs were isolated from supernatant of ASCs and the diameters of EVs were measured by using dynamic light scattering. The mice primary lung epithelial cells and mouse lung epithelial cell line (MLE12) were pre-treated with 200 ng/ml of Aspergillus protease and then treated with 1 μg/ml of ASC-derived EVs. Real time PCR was performed to determine the expression levels of eotaxin, IL-25, TGF-β, and IL-10 mRNAs after EV treatment. To evaluate the role of EVs in macrophage polarization and dendritic cells (DCs) differentiation, in vitro bone marrow-derived macrophage and DCs stimulation assay was performed. EV treatment significantly decreased the expression of eotaxin and IL-25 and increased TGF-β and IL-10 in both lung epithelial cells. EV treatment significantly increased the expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD40, CD80, and CD 86 in immature DCs. Furthermore, EV treatment significantly enhanced the gene expression of  macrophage marker such as Arg1, CCL22, IL-10, and TGF-β. In conclusion, EVs of ASCs ameliorated Th2-mediated  induced by Aspergillus protease antigen through the activation of dendritic cells and  macrophage, accompanied by down-regulation of eotaxin and IL-25, and up-regulation of TGF-β and IL-10 in mouse lung epithelial cells.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We previously demonstrated that the drug shifts macrophage polarization toward an alternative, anti-inflammatory phenotype. In this study we investigated the immunomodulatory mechanism of azithromycin through its alteration of signaling via the NF-κB and STAT1 pathways. J774 murine macrophages were plated, polarized (with IFN-γ, IL-4/-13, or with azithromycin plus IFN-γ) and stimulated with LPS. The effect of azithromycin on NF-κB and STAT1 signaling mediators was assessed by Western blot, homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay, nuclear translocation assay, and immunofluorescence. The drug's effect on gene and protein expression of arginase was evaluated as a marker of alternative macrophage activation. Azithromycin blocked NF-κB activation by decreasing p65 nuclear translocation, although blunting the degradation of IκBα was due, at least in part, to a decrease in IKKβ kinase activity. A direct correlation was observed between increasing azithromycin concentrations and increased IKKβ protein expression. Moreover, incubation with the IKKβ inhibitor IKK16 decreased arginase expression and activity in azithromycin-treated cells but not in cells treated with IL-4 and IL-13. Importantly, azithromycin treatment also decreased STAT1 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner, an effect that was reversed with IKK16 treatment. We conclude that azithromycin anti-inflammatory mechanisms involve inhibition of the STAT1 and NF-κB signaling pathways through the drug's effect on p65 nuclear translocation and IKKβ.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421131>Hypoxic preconditioning relieved ischemic cerebral injury by promoting immunomodulation and microglia polarization after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to investigate whether immunomodulation and Microglia polarization is involved in the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effect induced by hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) brain injury model.Longa method, (neurological disability status scale) NDSS method and TTC staining were used to evaluate the degree of cerebral infarction injury under different treatments (Sham, HPC, MCAO and co-treatment with HPC and MCAO).

Previous studies have demonstrated that hydrogen protects brain after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) by inhibiting , but the specific mechanism of anti-inflammatory effect of hydrogen is poorly understood. The goal of our study is to investigate whether inhalation of high concentration hydrogen (HCH) is able to attenuate I/R-induced microglia activation. Eighty C57B/L male mice were divided into four groups: sham, I/R, I/R + HCH and I/R + N/O groups. Assessment of animals happened in "blind" matter. I/R was induced by occlusion of middle cerebral artery for one hour). After one hour, filament was withdrawn, which induced reperfusion. Hydrogen treated I/R animals inhaled mix of 66.7% H balanced with O for 90 minutes, starting immediately after initiation of reperfusion. Control animals (N/O) inhaled mix in which hydrogen was replaced with N for the same time (90 minutes). The brain injury, such as brain infarction and development of brain edema, as well as neurobehavioral deficits were determined 23 hours after reperfusion. Effect of HCH on microglia activation in the ischemic penumbra was investigated by immunostaining also 23 hours after reperfusion. mRNA expression of  related genes was detected by PCR. Our results showed that HCH attenuated brain injury and consequently reduced neurological dysfunction after I/R. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HCH directed microglia polarization towards anti-inflammatory  polarization.

Interleukin-29 (IL-29), a member of type 3 interferon family, plays a role in host defenses against microbes, however, little is known about its role in metabolic disorders. We explored the function of IL-29 in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced  and insulin resistance. We found that serum IL-29 level was significantly higher in obese patients. IL-29 upregulated IL-1β, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and decreased glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity in human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes through reducing glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and AKT signals. In addition, IL-29 promoted monocyte/macrophage migration. Inhibition of IL-29 could reduce inflammatory cytokine production in macrophage-adipocyte coculture system, which mimic an obese microenvironment. In vivo, IL-29 reduced insulin sensitivity and increased the number of peritoneal macrophages in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. IL-29 increased M1/ macrophage ratio and enhanced MCP-1 expression in adipose tissues of HFD mice. Therefore, we have identified a critical role of IL-29 in obesity-induced  and insulin resistance, and we conclude that IL-29 may be a novel candidate target for treating obesity and insulin resistance in patients with metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316511>Plasminogen and the Plasminogen Receptor, Plg-R, Regulate Macrophage Phenotypic, and Functional Changes.</a></h2><p> resolution is an active process that functions to restore tissue homeostasis. Clearance of apoptotic leukocytes by efferocytosis at inflammatory sites plays an important role in  resolution and induces remarkable macrophage phenotypic and functional changes. Here, we investigated the effects of deletion of either plasminogen (Plg) or the Plg receptor, Plg-R, on the resolution of . In a murine model of pleurisy, the numbers of total mononuclear cells recruited to the pleural cavity were significantly decreased in both Plg and Plg-R  mice, a response associated with decreased levels of the chemokine CCL2 in pleural exudates. Increased percentages of M1-like macrophages were determined in pleural lavages of Plg and Plg-R  mice without significant changes in -like macrophage percentages. , Plg and plasmin (Pla) increased CD206/Arginase-1 expression and the levels of IL-10/TGF-β ( markers) while decreasing IFN/LPS-induced M1 markers in murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and human macrophages. Furthermore, IL4-induced -like polarization was defective in BMDMs from both Plg and Plg-R  mice. Mechanistically, Plg and Pla induced transient STAT3 phosphorylation, which was decreased in Plg and Plg-R  BMDMs after IL-4 or IL-10 stimulation. The extents of expression of CD206 and Annexin A1 (important for clearance of apoptotic cells) were reduced in Plg and Plg-R  macrophage populations, which exhibited decreased phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils (efferocytosis)  and . Taken together, these results suggest that Plg and its receptor, Plg-R, regulate macrophage polarization and efferocytosis, as key contributors to the resolution of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507109>[ASSOCIATION OF OBESITY, SMOKING AND SOCIOECONOMIC STRATA WITH THE FIBROMYALGIA SYNDROME].</a></h2><p>This study aimed to examine a possible association between BMI levels, smoking and socio-economic status and the existence of fibromyalgia.Obesity is a worldwide epidemic with devastating impacts on the public's health. There are several indications that obesity might also be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia.Patients who were diagnosed with fibromyalgia were compared to population-based controls, matched in age and gender (by a ratio of 1:5). Body mass indices, smoking status and socioeconomic strata were retrieved from computerized medical records of the Clalit Health Services database. Body mass index was classified in WHO categories of underweight, normal, overweight and obese (<18.5, 18.5-<25, 25.0-<30, ≥30.0 kg/); χ2, t-tests, and logistic regression models were used to compare the study groups and assess the association between obesity and fibromyalgia.The study included 14,296 patients with fibromyalgia and 71,324 controls. Among patients with fibromyalgia the average BMI (body mass index) was higher than that of the controls 29.1± 6.2 vs. 28.0± 6.01, p<0.001) with every increment of 1 unit of the BMI score, there was an increment of 2.7% of the odds of having coexistent fibromyalgia. The chances of having fibromyalgia was 56% higher among subjects with obesity compared to individuals of normal weight. The data revealed that patients with fibromyalgia smoke more and belong to lower socioeconomic levels.Our findings demonstrate that obesity is significantly associated with a higher proportion of fibromyalgia.

In this sense, strategies for its prevention are currently being evaluated. Natural products such as carotenoids or polyphenols, which are abundant in the marine environment, have been used in the prevention of oxidative stress due to their demonstrated antioxidant activities. Nevertheless, the anti-inflammatory activity and its implication in photo-prevention have not been extensively studied. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the combination of fucoxanthin (FX) and rosmarinic acid (RA) on cell viability, apoptosis induction, inflammasome regulation, and anti-oxidative response activation in UVB-irradiated HaCaT keratinocytes. We demonstrated for the first time that the combination of FX and RA (5 µM RA plus 5 μM FX, designated as ) improved antioxidant and anti-inflammatory profiles in comparison to compounds assayed individually, by reducing UVB-induced apoptosis and the consequent ROS production. Furthermore, the  combination modulated the inflammatory response through down-regulation of inflammasome components such as NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1, and the interleukin (IL)-1β production. In addition, Nrf2 and HO-1 antioxidant genes expression increased in UVB-exposed HaCaT cells pre-treated with .

The mechanisms that enforce macrophage divergence and dictate the phenotypic and metabolic characteristics of  macrophages remain elusive. We show that alternative activation with interleukin (IL)-4 induces expression of metallothionein 3 (MT3) that regulates macrophage polarization and function. MT3 was requisite for metabolic reprograming in IL-4-stimulated macrophages or M(IL-4) macrophages to promote mitochondrial respiration and suppress glycolysis. MT3 fostered an M(IL-4) phenotype, suppressed hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)1α activation, and thwarted the emergence of a proinflammatory M1 program in macrophages. MT3 deficiency augmented macrophage plasticity, resulting in enhanced interferon γ (IFNγ) responsiveness and a dampened M(IL-4) phenotype. Thus, MT3 programs the phenotype and metabolic fate of M(IL-4) macrophages.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447703>The Impact of Versatile Macrophage Functions on Acute Kidney Injury and Its Outcomes.</a></h2><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and devastating clinical condition with a high morbidity and mortality rate and is associated with a rapid decline of kidney function mostly resulting from the injury of proximal tubules.

For the  study, we used mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells, RBL-2H3, and rat peritoneal mast cells. G. inhibited mast cell degranulation upon immunoglobulin E (IgE) stimulation by suppressing the intracellular calcium. In addition, G. inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These inhibitory effects were dependent on the suppression of FcεRI-mediated activation of signaling molecules. To confirm the anti-allergic effects of G. , IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) and ovalbumin-induced active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA) models were utilized. Oral administration of G. suppressed the PCA reactions in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, G. reduced the ASA reactions, including hypothermia, histamine, interleukin-4, and IgE production.

Previous studies have indicated that quercetin, an abundant flavonoid in plants, exhibited renoprotective role in AKI. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we try to explore whether quercetin protects against AKI by inhibiting macrophage  via regulation of Mincle/Syk/NF-κB signaling. The results demonstrated that quercetin can significantly inhibit expression and secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in LPS-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and reduce activity of Mincle/Syk/NF-κB signaling in vitro. We also found that quercetin can strongly reduce the concentration of serum creatinine, BUN, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in cisplatin-induced AKI model. Furthermore, quercetin down-regulated protein levels of Mincle, phosphorylated Syk and NF-κB in kidney macrophages of AKI, as well as inhibited M1, up-regulated  macrophage activity. Notably, the down-regulation of LPS-induced  by quercetin was reversed after adding TDB (an agonist of Mincle) in BMDMs, suggesting that quercetin suppresses macrophage  may mainly through inhibiting Mincle and its downstream signaling.

Crocin, a carotenoid compound derived from crocus flowers, has anti-inflammatory properties, but its immunomodulatory function and role in particle-induced osteolysis are not well characterized. Here we report the effect of crocin on titanium (Ti) particle-induced macrophage polarization and osteogenic differentiation. We found that crocin induced anti-inflammatory () macrophage polarization and attenuated Ti particle-induced  by promoting the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines in vitro as well as in vivo in a mouse air-pouch model. Additionally, crocin pre-treated macrophages promoted osteogenic differentiation of co-cultured mouse bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs).

Consistent with this, diabetes mellitus impairs atherosclerosis regression after cholesterol lowering in humans and mice. In mice, this is attributed in part to hyperglycemia-induced monocytosis, which increases monocyte entry into plaques despite cholesterol lowering. In addition, diabetes mellitus skews plaque macrophages toward an atherogenic inflammatory M1 phenotype instead of toward the atherosclerosis-resolving  state typical with cholesterol lowering. Functional high-density lipoprotein (HDL), typically low in patients with diabetes mellitus, reduces monocyte precursor proliferation in murine bone marrow and has anti-inflammatory effects on human and murine macrophages. Our study aimed to test whether raising functional HDL levels in diabetic mice prevents monocytosis, reduces the quantity and  of plaque macrophages, and enhances atherosclerosis regression after cholesterol lowering.Aortic arches containing plaques developed in  mice were transplanted into either wild-type, diabetic wild-type, or diabetic mice transgenic for human apolipoprotein AI, which have elevated functional HDL. Recipient mice all had low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to promote plaque regression. After 2 weeks, plaques in recipient mouse aortic grafts were examined.Diabetic wild-type mice had impaired atherosclerosis regression, which was normalized by raising HDL levels. This benefit was linked to suppressed hyperglycemia-driven myelopoiesis, monocytosis, and neutrophilia. Increased HDL improved cholesterol efflux from bone marrow progenitors, suppressing their proliferation and monocyte and neutrophil production capacity. In addition to reducing circulating monocytes available for recruitment into plaques, in the diabetic milieu, HDL suppressed the general recruitability of monocytes to inflammatory sites and promoted plaque macrophage polarization to the , atherosclerosis-resolving state. There was also a decrease in plaque neutrophil extracellular traps, which are atherogenic and increased by diabetes mellitus.Raising apolipoprotein AI and functional levels of HDL promotes multiple favorable changes in the production of monocytes and neutrophils and in the inflammatory environment of atherosclerotic plaques of diabetic mice after cholesterol lowering and may represent a novel approach to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in people with diabetes mellitus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31510060>Lebetin 2, a Snake Venom-Derived B-Type Natriuretic Peptide, Provides Immediate and Prolonged Protection against Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury via Modulation of Post-Ischemic Inflammatory Response.</a></h2><p>Myocardial infarction (MI) followed by left ventricular (LV) remodeling is the most frequent cause of heart failure. Lebetin 2 (L2), a snake venom-derived natriuretic peptide, exerts cardioprotection during acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) ex vivo. However, its effects on delayed consequences of IR injury, including post-MI  and fibrosis have not been defined. Here, we determined whether a single L2 injection exerts cardioprotection in IR murine models in vivo, and whether inflammatory response to ischemic injury plays a role in L2-induced effects. We quantified infarct size (IS), fibrosis, , and both endothelial cell and cardiomyocyte densities in injured myocardium and compared these values with those induced by B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Both L2 and BNP reduced IS, fibrosis, and inflammatory response after IR, as evidenced by decreased leukocyte and proinflammatory M1 macrophage infiltrations in the infarcted area compared to untreated animals. However, only L2 increased anti-inflammatory -like macrophages. L2 also induced a higher density of endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. Our data show that L2 has strong, acute, prolonged cardioprotective effects in post-MI that are mediated, at least in part, by the modulation of the post-ischemic inflammatory response and especially, by the enhancement of -like macrophages, thus reducing IR-induced necrotic and fibrotic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302373>Luteolin reduces adipose tissue macrophage  and insulin resistance in postmenopausal obese mice.</a></h2><p>Previously, we showed that loss of ovarian function in mice fed high-fat diet exacerbated insulin resistance and adipose tissue . In the current study, we tested whether consumption of luteolin, an anti-inflammatory flavonoid, could mitigate adipose tissue  and insulin resistance in obese ovariectomized mice. Nine-week-old ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice were fed a low-fat diet, high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD supplemented with 0.005% luteolin (HFD+L) for 16 weeks. Results showed no difference in body weight or fat mass between mice fed HFD+L and those fed HFD. However, luteolin supplementation resulted in lower CD11c macrophages in gonadal adipose tissue, as well as a trend toward lower macrophage infiltration. Luteolin supplementation also significantly lowered mRNA expression of inflammatory and M1 markers MCP-1, CD11c, TNF-α and IL-6, while maintaining expression of  marker MGL1. Consistent with this, the in vitro luteolin treatment, with or without the presence of estrogen, inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced polarization of RAW 264.7 cells toward M1 phenotype. We further found that luteolin supplementation protected mice from insulin resistance induced by HFD consumption; this improved insulin resistance was correlated with reductions in CD11c adipose tissue macrophages. Taken together, these findings indicate that dietary luteolin supplementation attenuates adipose tissue  and insulin resistance found in mice with loss of ovarian function coupled with an HFD intake, and this effect may be partly mediated through suppressing M1-like polarization of macrophages in adipose tissue. These results have clinical implication in implementing dietary intervention for prevention of metabolic syndrome associated with postmenopause and obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We here addressed the influence of serum and blister fluid (BF) from patients with BP on the polarization status of macrophages with regards to the metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression. We demonstrated that several markers related to the alternatively activated macrophage phenotype () including IL-10, TARC, arginase, TNFα, and IL-1RA were meaningfully increased in BF of patients with BP. We further showed that BF, but not serum from patients with BP, significantly induced the expression of CD163, CD206, and IL-10 in BP monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Notably IL-10 was the only cytokine to be correlated to the reference clinical score, BP disease activity index (BPDAI), especially to the inflammatory BPDAI subscore evaluating urticarial and erythematous skin lesions ( = 0.57,  = 0.0004). We also found elevated levels of MMP-9 to -type macrophages  and highlighted the presence of CD163 MMP-9 macrophages histologically, at skin lesional site.

Monocyte-derived macrophages, characterized by high heterogeneity and plasticity, are recruited, activated, and polarized in the whole process of renal fibrotic diseases in response to local microenvironment. As classically activated M1 or CD11b/Ly6C macrophages accelerate renal injury by producing pro-inflammatory factors like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and interleukins, alternatively activated  or CD11b/Ly6C macrophages may contribute to kidney repair by exerting anti- and wound healing functions. However, uncontrolled  macrophages or CD11b/Ly6C macrophages promote renal fibrosis via paracrine effects or direct transition to myofibroblast-like cells via the process of macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition (MMT).

However, excessive NETs can cause severe inflammatory reactions. Macrophages are classified as M1 macrophages with proinflammatory effects or  macrophages with anti-inflammatory effects. During ALI, alveolar macrophages (AMs) polarize to the M1 phenotype. This study tested the hypothesis that NETs may aggravate ALI or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)  by promoting alveolar macrophage polarization to the M1 type. Our research was carried out in three aspects: clinical research, animal experiments and in vitro experiments. We determined that NET levels in ARDS patients were positively correlated with M1-like macrophage polarization. NET formation was detected in murine ALI tissue and associated with increased M1 markers and decreased  markers in BALF and lung tissue. Treatment with NET inhibitors significantly inhibitor NETs generation, downregulated M1 markers and upregulated  markers. Regardless of LPS pre-stimulation, significant secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulated M1 markers were detected from bone marrow-derived macrophages (M0 and ) cocultured with high concentrations of NETs; conversely,  markers were downregulated. In conclusion, NETs promote ARDS  during the acute phase by promoting macrophage polarization to the M1 phenotype. We propose that NETs play an important role in the interaction between neutrophils and macrophages during the early acute phase of ALI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These findings suggest that incorporating vitamin D into medical devices or scaffolds could positively modulate host immune response and prevent infections. In the current study, we evaluated host responses and endogenous antimicrobial peptide production using 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)-eluting radially aligned PCL nanofiber scaffolds in human immune system-engrafted mice. We transformed traditional 2D electrospun nanofiber membranes into radially aligned PCL nanofiber scaffolds using the concept of solid of revolution and an innovative gas-foaming technique. Such scaffolds can promote rapid cellular infiltration and neovascularization. The infiltrating immune cells within subcutaneously implanted 25(OH)D-containing scaffolds mainly consisted of human macrophages in the M1 phase (CCR7), mice macrophages in the  phase (CD206), and human cytotoxic T cells (CD8) other than few human T-helper cells (CD4). The 25(OH)D-eluting nanofiber scaffolds significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), while accelerating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) within the scaffolds. Additionally, we observed increased expression of human cathelicidin LL-37 within the 25(OH)D-eluting scaffolds, while no LL-37 expression was observed in the control. Together, these findings support further work in the design of vitamin D-eluting medical devices or scaffolds for modulating immune response and promoting antimicrobial peptide production. This could potentially reduce the inflammatory response, prevent infections, and eventually improve success rates of implants. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Transplant failure of medical devices, grafts, scaffolds, and tissue-engineered constructs due to  and infection causes not only economic losses but also sufferings of second operation to the patient. Positive modulation of the host response to implants, scaffolds, and tissue-engineered constructs is likely to reduce the failure rate. Vitamin D plays an important role in modulating the immune response. It is able to not only reduce  and induce endogenous antimicrobial peptide production but also prevent multidrug resistance and other side effects of traditional antibiotics. In this study, host responses to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)-eluting radially aligned PCL nanofiber scaffolds were evaluated in human immune system-engrafted mice. The 25(OH)D-eluting medical devices or scaffolds were able to modulate positive immune response and promote antimicrobial peptide production.

Chemokine networks play a critical role in directing the recruitment of immune cells to sites of injury and have been shown to regulate cell behavior. In this study, we investigated the role of the CCL2/CCR2 signaling axis in cartilage regeneration and degeneration. CCL2 , CCR2 , CCL2 CCR2 , and control (C57) mice were subjected to full-thickness cartilage defect (FTCD) injuries (n = 9/group) within the femoral groove. Cartilage regeneration at 4 and 12 weeks post-FTCD was assessed using a 14-point histological scoring scale. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (Sca-1 , CD140a ), macrophages (M1:CD38 , :CD206 , and M0:F4/80 ) and proliferating cells (Ki67 ) were quantified within joints using immunofluorescence. The multi-lineage differentiation capacity of Sca1 MSCs was determined for all mouse strains. ACL transection (ACL-x) was employed to determine if CCL2 CCR2 mice were protected against osteoarthritis (OA) (n  = 6/group). Absence of CCR2, but not CCL2 nor both (CCL2 and CCR2), enhanced spontaneous articular cartilage regeneration by 4 weeks post-FTCD. Furthermore, increased chondrogenesis was observed in MSCs derived from CCR2 mice. CCL2 deficiency promoted MSC homing to the adjacent synovium and FTCD at both 4 and 12 weeks post-injury; with no MSCs present at the surface of the FTCD in the remaining strains. Lower OA scores were observed in CCL2 CCR2 mice at 12 weeks post-ACL-x compared with C57 mice. Our findings demonstrate an inhibitory role for CCR2 in cartilage regeneration after injury, while CCL2 is required for regeneration, acting through a CCR2 independent mechanism.© 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Accumulating evidence showed the importance of the sensory neurons signal upon immune cells by releasing neuropeptides and chemokines to regulate associated immune-inflammatory response. In this study, we investigated the significance of sensory neuron neuropeptides and chemokine signals on -induced macrophages polarization during GA. : We screened the mRNA expression profile during GA in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons to identify the most likely candidate that mediates the neuro-immune communication. Then, we silenced specific gene expression in the DRG by lentiviral vectors in the monosodium urate (MSU)-induced ankle GA mouse model and evaluated alterations in the inflammatory response. In vitro, primary macrophages were used to investigate the neural impact on M1/ subtype polarization, proinflammatory cytokine production and downstream endothelial damage. Mechanism by which macrophage  is induced in the DRG was evaluated by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation. : We found that secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (sFRP2) was the most upregulated gene in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in response to monosodium urate (MSU) deposition. Injection of LV-sFRP2-shRNA into the L4 and L5 DRG significantly suppressed inflammatory cell infiltration and M1 polarization in the synovial membrane, attenuating hyperalgesia and ankle swelling in the GA mouse model. In vitro, DRG neurons-derived sFRP2 promoted M1 polarization and macrophage migration, thereby upregulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines and preventing endothelial apoptosis. Furthermore, DRG-derived sFRP2 activated the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway by destabilizing the β-catenin and p65 complex. : We demonstrated the involvement of a sensory neuron-macrophage axis in GA pathology that was regulated by sFRP2 expression in a paracrine manner.

In addition, ERS enhances macrophage activation. So far, the function of Hoxa5 in obesity-induced chronic  has been poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of the transcription factor, Hoxa5, in determining adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) polarity and ERS. Hoxa5 decreased bodyweight, reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion and corresponded with an increased number of  macrophages in the adipose tissue of high-fat diet (HFD) mice. Transcriptome sequencing data showed that overexpression of Hoxa5 in adipocytes changed expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein processing-related genes. Based on transcriptome sequencing data and bioinformatics prediction, we have been suggested that Hoxa5 alleviated inflammatory responses by inhibiting ERS and by activating PPARγ pathway in mouse adipose tissue. Hoxa5 alleviated ERS and inflammatory responses by inhibiting the eIF2α/PERK signalling pathway in adipocytes. Hoxa5 also inhibited chronic  of adipocytes by promoting  macrophage polarization. In addition, Hoxa5 transcriptionally activated the PPARγ pathway to promote polarization of  macrophages, which in turn alleviated chronic  of adipocytes. Taken together, these results shed light on the mechanisms underlying Hoxa5-dependent inhibition of obesity-induced chronic  by reducing ERS and promoting polarization of  macrophages. These results suggest that Hoxa5 may be a potential therapeutic target for obesity and other metabolic syndromes.© 2019 The Authors.

Recombinant Sj16 (rSj16), a 16-kDa protein of Schistosoma japonicum produced in Escherichia coli, has been demonstrated to have novel immunoregulatory effects in vivo and in vitro. Thus, this study investigated the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of rSj16 treatment in S. japonicum-infected mice and demonstrated the immune modulation between the schistosome and the host.Schistosoma japonicum infected mice were treated with the rSj16 protein and Sj16 peptide at different time points post-infection to assess their efficacy at the optimal time point. Sj16 peptide and/or Praziquantel (PZQ) treatments were initiated at week 5 post-infection to compare the therapeutic efficacy of each regimen. Hepatic granulomatous , fibrosis and cytokine production (pro-inflammatory, Th1, Th2, Th17 and regulatory cytokines IL-10) were detected. Moreover,  macrophages were measured to illuminate the mechanisms of Sj16.The rSj16 protein and Sj16 peptide had significant protective effects in S. japonicum-infected mice, as shown by decreased granuloma formation, areas of collagen deposition and inhibition of pro-inflammatory Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokine production. These protective activities were more obvious when animals were treated with either the Sj16 protein or peptide at early stages post-infection. Interestingly, the combined treatment of PZQ and Sj16 was more effective and upregulated IL-10 production than administration of PZQ alone in infected mice. Furthermore, the Sj16 treatment alleviated the pathological effects associated with activated  macrophages.This study demonstrates the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of rSj16 in schistosomiasis. Therefore, the combination of rSj16 with PZQ could be a viable and promising therapeutic strategy for schistosomiasis. In addition, this investigation provides additional information on schistosome-mediated immune modulation and host-parasite interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611307>Serum amyloid A-mediated inflammasome activation of microglial cells in cerebral ischemia.</a></h2><p>Serum Amyloid A (SAA) proteins are acute-phase reactant associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and that increase in the plasma 1000-fold during . Recent studies have implicated SAAs in innate immunity and various disorders, however the precise mechanism eludes us. Previous studies have shown SAAs are elevated following stroke and cerebral ischemiand our studies demonstrated that SAA deficient mice reduces  and infarct volumes in a mouse stroke model. Our studies demonstrate SAA increases the cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is mediated by Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, cathepsin B and caspase-1 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. SAA induced the expression of NLRP3 which mediated IL-1β induction in murine BV-2 cells and both sex primary mouse microglial cells, in a dose and time dependent fashion. Inhibition or knockout of the NLRP3 in microglia prevented the increase in IL-1β. -acetyl--cysteine and mito-TEMPO blocked the induction of IL-1β by inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) with SAA treatment. In addition, inhibition of cathepsin B with different drugs or microglia from CatB deficient mice attenuated inflammasome activation. Our studies suggest that the impact of SAA on inflammasome stimulation is mediated in part by the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor proteins 2 and 4. SAA induced inflammatory cytokines and an M1 phenotype in the microglial cells, while downregulating anti-  phenotype. These studies suggest that brain injury to can elicit a systemic inflammatory response mediated through SAA that contributes to the pathological outcomes.In the present study, SAA can induce that activation of the inflammasome in microglial cells and give rise to IL-1β release which can further  in the brain following neurological diseases.

Synovial macrophages are likely involved. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5). In vitro M1-polarized macrophages presented significantly higher IRF5 expression than -polarized macrophages. Interestingly, IRF5 expression was observed in macrophages from the synovial fluid of OA patients, and the level of IRF expression was positively correlated with disease severity, such that stage 4 OA synovial macrophages presented significantly higher levels of IRF5 than stage 2 and stage 3 OA synovial macrophages. Circulating monocytes from OA patients, on the other hand, expressed little IRF5. However, synovial fluid from OA patients could significantly upregulate IRF5 expression in circulating monocytes. Synovial macrophages also expressed significantly higher IL-12 than circulating monocytes, and circulating monocytes conditioned in OA synovial fluid demonstrated significantly higher IL-12 expression. Direct IRF5 transfection could increase IL-12 expression in circulating monocytes. Interestingly, IRF5-transfected monocytes promoted the expression of Th1-associated genes in naive CD4 T cells via an IL-12-dependent mechanism. Overall, our study demonstrated that IRF5 expression was associated with OA severity and could contribute to the activation of the M1-Th1 axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401378>Dexamethasone exhibits its anti-inflammatory effects in S. aureus induced microglial  via modulating TLR-2 and glucocorticoid receptor expression.</a></h2><p>Microglial  plays crucial role in the pathogenesis of CNS infections including brain abscesses. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is considered as one of the major causative agents of brain abscesses. Due to the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria the available treatment options including conventional antibiotics and steroid therapy become ineffective in terms of  regulation which warrants further investigation to resolve this health issue. Microglial TLR-2 plays important roles in the bacterial recognition as well as induction of  whereas glucocorticoid receptor (GR) triggers anti-inflammatory pathways in presence of glucocorticoids (GCs). The main objective of this study was to figure out the interdependency between TLR-2 and GR in presence of exogenous dexamethasone during microglial  as an alternative therapeutic approach. Experiments were done either in TLR-2 neutralized condition or GR blocked condition in presence of dexamethasone. Free radicals production, arginase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase enzyme activities and corticosterone concentration were measured along with Western blot analysis of TLR-2, GR and other inflammatory molecules. The results suggested that dexamethasone pre-treatment in TLR-2 neutralized condition efficiently reduces the inflammatory consequences of S. aureus induced microglial  through up regulating GR expression. During TLR-2 blocking dexamethasone exerted its potent anti-inflammatory activities via suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS), NO production and up regulating arginase, SOD and catalase activities at the time point of 90 min. Further in-vivo experiments are needed to conclude that dexamethasone could resolve brain  possibly through microglial phenotypic switching from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, strategies that reprogram inflammatory macrophages may improve the healing of poor wounds, particularly in the aged skin of individuals with diabetes or other chronic diseases. As shown in our previous study, KGM-modified SiO nanoparticles (KSiNPs) effectively activate macrophages to differentiate into the -type phenotype by inducing mannose receptor (MR) clustering on the cell surface. Here, we assess whether KSiNPs accelerate wound healing following acute or chronic skin injury. Using a full-thickness excision model in either diabetic mice or healthy mice, the wounds treated with KSiNPs displayed a dramatically increased closure rate and collagen production, along with decreased  and increased angiogenesis in the regenerating tissues. Furthermore, KSiNPs induced the formation of -like macrophages by clustering MR on the cells. Accordingly, the cytokines produced by the KSiNP-treated macrophages were capable of inducing fibroblast proliferation and subsequent secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM). Based on these results, KSiNPs display great potential as an effective therapeutic approach for cutaneous wounds by effectively suppressing excessive or persistent  and fibrosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In response to chronic ethanol, Kupffer cells, the resident macrophage of livers, and peripheral monocytes become sensitized to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), express more pro-inflammatory cytokines and exhibit macrophage M1/ hyperpolarization. Since miRNAs play an important role in the regulation of M1/ polarization, we hypothesized that miRNAs regulating macrophage polarization would be dysregulated after chronic ethanol consumption. miRNA sequencing data from Kupffer cells isolated from rats fed an ethanol diet vs. control diet and qPCR data from PBMCs isolated from alcoholic hepatitis (AH) patients and healthy controls were used to assess the role of miRNAs in macrophage hyperpolarization in ALD. Differential expression analyses revealed 40 misregulated miRNAs in Kupffer cells from the chronic ethanol-fed rats compared to pair-fed controls. Nine of these miRNAs are known to be associated with macrophage polarization and consist of a mixture of M1- and -associated miRNAs, indicative of hyperpolarization. Twenty-three of the 40 differentially expressed miRNAs were localized to miRNA clusters throughout the genome. Correlation analyses revealed that miRNAs in three of these clusters were co-regulated and located within antisense non-coding RNAs. Similar to Kupffer cells from ethanol-fed rats, M1 and  polarization markers, as well as sensitivity to LPS, were elevated in PBMCs from AH patients compared to healthy controls. These increases were associated with an up-regulation of polarization-associated miRNAs, including miR-125a-5p, a miRNA associated with hyperpolarization. miR-125a-5p is clustered in the genome with other miRNAs inside a host gene, Spaca6, which was also upregulated in PBMCs, as well as isolated monocytes, from AH patients. Finally, correlation analyses revealed co-regulation of human polarization-associated miRNA clusters. While expression of polarization-associated miRNAs in clusters was upregulated in AH compared to healthy controls, co-regulation of the miRNAs within a cluster was independent of disease state. Together, these results reveal that global changes in miRNA regulation are associated with polarization phenotypes in Kupffer cells from rat after chronic ethanol as well as in PBMCs from patients with AH. Importantly, polarization-associated miRNAs were localized to coordinately regulated clusters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302012>Markers of adipose tissue  are transiently elevated during intermittent fasting in women who are overweight or obese.</a></h2><p>This study compared the effects of daily calorie restriction (DR) versus intermittent fasting (IF) on markers of  and extracellular matrix deposition in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in a controlled feeding trial in women with overweight or obesity.Women (N = 76) were randomised to one of three diets and provided with all foods at 100% (IF100) or 70% (IF70 and DR70) of calculated energy requirements for 8 weeks. IF groups ate breakfast prior to fasting for 24-h on 3 non-consecutive days/week. Weight, body composition, serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), M1- and -macrophage markers by qPCR and immunohistochemistry in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle were measured following a 12-h overnight fast (fed day, all groups) and a 24-h fast (IF groups only).IF70 resulted in greater weight and fat losses and reductions in serum NEFA versus DR70 and IF100 (P < 0.05) after fed days. Markers of  in serum (TNFα, IL6 and IL10), subcutaneous adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (CD68, CD40 and CD163) were unchanged by DR or IF after fed days. After fasting, NEFA, M1-macrophages (CD40) in adipose tissue, and -macrophages (CD163) in muscle were increased in IF70 and IF100 (all P < 0.05) and the changes in NEFA and mRNA of pan-macrophage marker CD68 in adipose tissue were positively correlated (r = 0.56, P = 0.002).Unlike caloric restriction, IF transiently elevated markers of macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, possibly in response to marked increases in adipose tissue lipolysis.Crown Copyright © 2019.

Two cell types within the synovium that play an important role in RA are fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and macrophages. The latter innate immune cells show a high plasticity in their phenotype and are central in inflammatory processes. Low-dose radiotherapy (LD-RT) with particularly a single dose of 0.5 Gy has been demonstrated to have a positive impact on pain, , and bone in inflamed joints. We now examined for the first time how LD-RT influences FLS and bone marrow-derived macrophages in co-culture systems of an experimental model of RA to reveal further mechanisms of immune modulatory effects of low and intermediate dose of ionizing radiation. For this, the bone marrow of h tg mice was differentiated either with cytokines to obtain key macrophage phenotypes (M0, M1, and ) or with supernatants (SN) of untreated or irradiated FLS. Flow cytometry analyses were used to analyse the impact of radiation (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) on the phenotype of macrophages in the presence or absence of SN of FLS. LD-RT had no impact on cytokine-mediated macrophage polarization in M0, M1, or  macrophages. However, SN of irradiated FLS particularly reduced CD206 expression on macrophages. Macrophage phenotype was stable when being in contact with SN of nonirradiated FLS, but significantly increased surface expression of CD206 and slightly decreased CD80 and CD86 expression were observed when macrophage themselves were irradiated with 0.5 Gy under these microenvironmental conditions, again highlighting discontinuous dose dependencies in the low and intermediate dose range. One can conclude that FLS-dependent microenvironmental conditions have a slight influence on the modulation of macrophage phenotype under radiation exposure conditions. Future studies are needed to reveal the impact of radiation exposure on the functions of treated macrophages under such microenvironmental conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492694>Metabolism of Strained Rings: Glutathione -transferase-Catalyzed Formation of a Glutathione-Conjugated Spiro-azetidine without Prior Bioactivation.</a></h2><p>AZD1979 [(3-(4-(2-oxa-6-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-ylmethyl)phenoxy)azetidin-1-yl)(5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)methanone] is a melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 antagonist designed for the treatment of obesity. In this study, metabolite profiles of AZD1979 in human hepatocytes revealed a series of glutathione-related metabolites, including the glutathionyl, cysteinyl, cysteinylglycinyl, and mercapturic acid conjugates. The formation of these metabolites was not inhibited by coincubation with the cytochrome P450 (P450) inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole. In efforts to identify the mechanistic features of this pathway, investigations were performed to characterize the structure of the glutathionyl conjugate M12 of AZD1979 and to identify the enzyme system catalyzing its formation. Studies with various human liver subcellular fractions established that the formation of M12 was NAD(P)H-independent and proceeded in cytosol and S9 fractions but not in microsomal or mitochondrial fractions. The formation of M12 was inhibited by ethacrynic acid, an inhibitor of glutathione -transferases (GSTs). Several human recombinant GSTs, including GSTA1, A2-2, M1a, -2, T1-1, and GST from human placenta, were incubated with AZD1979. All GSTs tested catalyzed the formation of M12, with GSTA2-2 being the most efficient. Metabolite M12 was purified from rat liver S9 incubations and its structure elucidated by NMR. These results establish that M12 is the product of the GST-catalyzed glutathione attack on the carbon atom  to the nitrogen atom of the strained spiro-azetidinyl moiety to give, after ring opening, the corresponding amino-thioether conjugate product, a direct conjugation pathway that occurs without the prior substrate bioactivation by P450. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The investigated compound, AZD1979, contains a 6-substituted-2-oxa-6-azaspiro[3.3]heptanyl derivative that is an example of strained heterocycles, including spiro-fused ring systems, that are widely used in synthetic organic chemistry. An unusual azetidinyl ring-opening reaction involving a nucleophilic attack by glutathione, which does not involve prior cytochrome P450-catalyzed bioactivation of the substrate and which is catalyzed by glutathione transferases, is reported. We propose a mechanism involving the protonated cyclic aminyl intermediate that undergoes nucleophilic attack by glutathione thiolate anion in this reaction, catalyzed by glutathione transferases.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31403827>Interleukin-11 Overexpression and  Macrophage Density are Associated with Angiogenic Activity in Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy.</a></h2><p>: To investigate the expression of IL-11 and its receptor IL-11Rα and to quantify density of CD163  macrophages in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). : Vitreous samples from 29 PDR and 19 nondiabetic patients, epiretinal fibrovascular membranes from 15 patients with PDR and Müller cells were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. : We showed a significant increase in expression of IL-11, soluble(s) IL-11Rα, sCD163 and VEGF in vitreous samples from PDR patients compared to nondiabetic controls.

However, the repair and related pathophysiology of white matter after brain injury remains relatively elusive and underexplored. Successful neuroregeneration is a method for the potential treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. A non-steroidal estrogen receptor modulator, Tamoxifen, is an effective inhibitor of cell-swelling-activated anion channels and can mimic neuroprotective effects of estrogen in experimental ischemic stroke. However, its remains unclear whether Tamoxifen has beneficial effects in the pathological process after WMLs. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of Tamoxifen on multiple elements of oligovascular niche of the male C57BL/6 mice brain after bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) - induced WMLs. Tamoxifen was injected intraperitoneally once daily from 1 day after BCAS until 1 day before sacrificed. Following chronic hypoperfusion, BCAS mice presented white matter demyelination, loss of axon-glia integrity, activated inflammatory response, and cognitive impairments. Tamoxifen treatment significantly facilitated functional restoration of working memory impairment in mice after white matter injury, thus indicating a translational potential for this estrogen receptor modulator given its clinical safety and applicability for WMLs, which lack of currently available treatments. Furthermore, Tamoxifen treatment reduced microglia activation and inflammatory response, favored microglial polarization toward to the  phenotype, enhanced oligodendrocyte precursor cells proliferation and differentiation, and promoted remyelination after chronic hypoperfusion. Together, our data indicate that Tamoxifen could alleviate white matter injury and play multiple targets protective effects following chronic hypoperfusion, which is a promising candidate for the therapeutic target for ischemic WMLs and other demyelination diseases associated cognitive impairment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, reports regarding their effects on  and lipid handling are controversial. Here, we compare the effect of these two drugs on the expression of proteins involved in cholesterol handling and lipid accumulation in a macrophage cell system utilizing M0, M1 and  human macrophages and in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM).Differentiated M0, M1 and  subsets of THP-1 human macrophages were subjected to various concentrations of either MPA or CsA. Expression of proteins involved in reverse cholesterol transport (ABCA1 and 27-hydroxylase) and scavenger receptors, responsible for uptake of modified lipids (CD36, ScR-A1, CXCL16 and LOX-1), were evaluated by real-time PCR and confirmed with Western blot. DiI-oxidized LDL internalization assay was used to assess foam cell formation. The influence of MPA was also evaluated in BMDM obtained from atherosclerosis-prone transgenic mice, ApoE and ApoEFas.In M0 macrophages, MPA increased expression of ABCA1 and CXCL16 in a concentration-dependent manner. In M1 THP-1 macrophages, MPA caused a significant increase of 27-hydroxylase mRNA and CD36 and SR-A1 receptor mRNAs. Exposure of  macrophages to MPA also stimulated expression of 27-hydroxylase, while downregulating all evaluated scavenger receptors. In contrast, CsA had no impact on cholesterol efflux in M0 and M1 macrophages, but significantly augmented expression of ABCA1 and 27-hydroxylase in  macrophages. CsA significantly increased expression of the LOX1 receptor in naïve macrophages, downregulated expression of CD36 and SR-A1 in the M1 subpopulation and upregulated expression of all evaluated scavenger receptors. However, CsA enhanced foam cell transformation in M0 and  macrophages, while MPA had no effect on foam cell formation unless used at a high concentration in the  subtype.Our results clearly underline the importance of further evaluation of the effects of these drugs when used in atherosclerosis-prone patients with autoimmune or renal disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31277709>Nanomedicine-driven neuropathic pain relief in a rat model is associated with macrophage polarity and mast cell activation.</a></h2><p>We explored the immune neuropathology underlying multi-day relief from neuropathic pain in a rat model initiated at the sciatic nerve, by using a nanoemulsion-based nanomedicine as a biological probe. The nanomedicine is theranostic: both therapeutic (containing celecoxib drug) and diagnostic (containing near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye) and is small enough to be phagocytosed by circulating monocytes. We show that pain-like behavior reaches a plateau of maximum hypersensitivity 8 days post-surgery, and is the rationale for intravenous delivery at this time-point. Pain relief is evident within 24 h, lasting approximately 6 days. The ipsilateral sciatic nerve and associated L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tissue of both nanomedicine and control (nanoemulsion without drug) treated animals was investigated by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy at the peak of pain relief (day-12 post-surgery), and when pain-like hypersensitivity returns (day-18 post-surgery). At day-12, a significant reduction of infiltrating macrophages, mast cells and mast cell degranulation was observed at the sciatic nerve following treatment. In the DRG, there was no effect of treatment at both day-12 and day-18. Conversely, at the DRG, there is a significant increase in macrophage infiltration and mast cell degranulation at day-18. The treatment effect on immune pathology in the sciatic nerve was investigated further by assessing the expression of macrophage cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-the drug target-and extracellular prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), as well as the proportion of M1 (pro-inflammatory) and  (anti-inflammatory) macrophages. At day-12, there is a significant reduction of COX-2 positive macrophages, extracellular PGE2, and a striking reversal of macrophage polarity. At day-18, these measures revert to levels observed in control-treated animals.

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) invades the CNS, resulting in neuroinflammation, which turns the neuroprotective role of microglia detrimental as characterized by increased microglial activation and neuronal death. Several host factors, including microRNAs, play vital roles in regulating virus-induced . In the current study, we demonstrate that the expression of miR-301a is increased in JEV-infected microglial cells and human brain. Overexpression of miR-301a augments the JEV-induced inflammatory response, whereas inhibition of miR-301a completely reverses the effects. Mechanistically, NF-κB-repressing factor (NKRF) functioning as inhibitor of NF-κB activation is identified as a potential target of miR-301a in JEV infection. Consequently, miR-301a-mediated inhibition of NKRF enhances nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which, in turn, resulted in amplified inflammatory response. Conversely, NKRF overexpression in miR-301a-inhibited condition restores nuclear accumulation of NF-κB to a basal level. We also observed that JEV infection induces classical activation (M1) of microglia that drives the production of proinflammatory cytokines while suppressing alternative activation () that could serve to dampen the inflammatory response. Furthermore, in vivo neutralization of miR-301a in mouse brain restores NKRF expression, thereby reducing inflammatory response, microglial activation, and neuronal apoptosis. Thus, our study suggests that the JEV-induced expression of miR-301a positively regulates inflammatory response by suppressing NKRF production, which might be targeted to manage viral-induced neuroinflammation.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447644>Emerging Evidence of Macrophage Contribution to Hyperinnervation and Nociceptor Sensitization in Vulvodynia.</a></h2><p>Vulvodynia is an idiopathic chronic pain disorder and a leading cause of dyspareunia, or pain associated with sexual intercourse, for women. The key pathophysiological features of vulvodynia are vaginal hyperinnervation and nociceptor sensitization. These features have been described consistently by research groups over the past 30 years, but currently there is no first-line recommended treatment that targets this pathophysiology. Instead, psychological interventions, pelvic floor physiotherapy and surgery to remove painful tissue are recommended, as these are the few interventions that have shown some benefit in clinical trials. Recurrence of vulvodynia is frequent, even after vestibulectomy and questions regarding etiology remain. Vestibular biopsies from women with vulvodynia contain increased abundance of immune cells including macrophages as well as increased numbers of nerve fibers. Macrophages have multiple roles in the induction and resolution of  and their function can be broadly described as pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory depending on their polarization state. This state is not fixed and can alter rapidly in response to the microenvironment. Essentially, M1, or classically activated macrophages, produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and promote nociceptor sensitization and mechanical allodynia, whereas , or alternatively activated macrophages produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and promote functions such as wound healing. Signaling between macrophages and neurons has been shown to promote axonal sprouting and nociceptor sensitization.

MSC infusion ameliorated metabolic abnormalities and preserved cardiac structure and function in DCM rats. Moreover, MSC infusion significantly increased the  phenotype macrophages and alleviated cardiac . Interestingly, this in vitro study revealed that the MSCs pretreated with a COX-2 inhibitor had little effect on  macrophage polarization, but this phenomenon could be reversed by adding prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).Our results suggested that MSC infusions can protect against cardiac injury in DCM rats.

This effect was achieved by promoting the expression of reverse transporters (ATP-binding cassette transporter member 1 and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 1) and inhibiting the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB-mediated phosphorylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393854>Stress responses,  macrophages, and a distinct microbial signature in fatal intestinal acute graft-versus-host disease.</a></h2><p>Steroid-refractory intestinal acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a frequently fatal condition with little known about mechanisms driving failed steroid responses in gut mucosa. To uncover novel molecular insights in steroid-refractory aGVHD, we compared gene expression profiles of rectosigmoid biopsies from patients at diagnosis of clinical stage 3-4 lower intestinal aGVHD (N=22), to repeat biopsies when the patients became steroid refractory (N=22), and normal controls (N=10). We also performed single gene analyses of factors associated with tolerance (programmed death ligand-1 [PDL1], indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase [IDO1], and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains [TIGIT]) and found that significantly higher expression levels of these aGVHD inhibitory genes (PDL1, IDO1, TIGIT) at aGVHD onset became decreased in the steroid-refractory state. We examined genes triggered by microbial ligands to stimulate gut repair, amphiregulin (AREG) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and found that both AREG and AhR gene expression levels were increased at aGVHD onset and remained elevated in steroid-refractory aGVHD. We also identified higher expression levels of metallothioneines, metal-binding enzymes induced in stress responses, and  macrophage genes in steroid-refractory aGVHD. We observed no differences in T-cell subsets between onset and steroid-refractory aGVHD. Patients with a rapidly fatal course showed greater DNA damage and a distinct microbial signature at aGVHD onset, whereas patients with more prolonged survival exhibited a gene expression profile consistent with activation of Smoothened. Our results extend the paradigm beyond T cell-centric therapies for steroid-refractory GI aGVHD and highlight new mechanisms for therapeutic exploration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590323>A Virus-Derived Immune Modulating Serpin Accelerates Wound Closure with Improved Collagen Remodeling.</a></h2><p>Numerous treatments have been developed to promote wound healing based on current understandings of the healing process. Hemorrhaging, clotting, and associated  regulate early wound healing. We investigated treatment with a virus-derived immune modulating serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN), Serp-1, which inhibits thrombolytic proteases and , in a mouse excisional wound model. Saline or recombinant Serp-1 were applied directly to wounds as single doses of 1 μg or 2 µg or as two 1 µg boluses. A chitosan-collagen hydrogel was also tested for Serp-1 delivery. Wound size was measured daily for 15 days and scarring assessed by Masson's trichrome, Herovici's staining, and immune cell dynamics and angiogenesis by immunohistochemistry. Serp-1 treatment significantly accelerated wound healing, but was blocked by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPAR) antibody. Repeated dosing at a lower concentration was more effective than single high-dose serpin. A single application of Serp-1-loaded chitosan-collagen hydrogel was as effective as repeated aqueous Serp-1 dosing. Serp-1 treatment of wounds increased arginase-1-expressing -polarized macrophage counts and periwound angiogenesis in the wound bed. Collagen staining also demonstrated that Serp-1 improves collagen maturation and organization at the wound site. Serp-1 has potential as a safe and effective immune modulating treatment that targets thrombolytic proteases, accelerating healing and reducing scar in deep cutaneous wounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638565>[Knockout of TLR2 gene attenuates insulin resistance and promotes  polarization of macrophages in mice].</a></h2><p>Objective To study the effect of deletion of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) gene on insulin resistance and polarization of macrophages in mice. Methods The wild-type (WT) and TLR2 knockout (TLR2) C57BL/6 male mice, aged 28 days, were selected, with 12 mice in each group. The genotype of each mouse was identified by PCR. After mice were fed with basic diet for 3 months, the glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin resistance test (ITT) were performed. The mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood were stimulated with GM-CSF/IFN-γ and M-CSF/IL-4/IL-13, respectively, to induce differentiation to M1-like and -like macrophages. The CD11b, F4/80, CD11c, CD206 and early growth response 2 (EGR2) were detected by flow cytometry to determine the phenotype of macrophages. The levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 in the culture supernatant of macrophages were detected using ELISA. Results The result of PCR identification was consistent with the genotype of mice. Compared to WT mice, TLR2 mice exhibited the significantly improved glycemic control at 30 min during GTT and the significantly increased insulin sensitivity at 15 minutes during ITT. The flow cytometry showed that M1 markers decreased and  macrophages increased in the TLR2 mice. ELISA showed that the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α significantly decreased in the culture supernatant of M1 macrophages, while the level of IL-10 significantly increased in the culture supernatant of  macrophages in TLR2 mice compared with WT mice. Conclusion TLR2 signal has an effect on the polarization of macrophages and makes macrophages tend to switch to M1 phenotype. A higher number of pro-inflammatory factors secreted by M1 macrophages contribute to a low-grade  state in the body, which leads to a decrease in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513837>KDM3A inhibition modulates macrophage polarization to aggravate post-MI injuries and accelerates adverse ventricular remodeling via an IRF4 signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>It has been reported that KDM3A participates in several cardiovascular diseases through epigenetic mechanisms. However, its biological role post myocardial infarction (MI) has not been explored. Excessive and prolonged  period can aggravate post-MI injuries and accelerates left ventricular (LV) remodeling. Previous studies have shown that macrophages play a momentous role in post-MI injuries by regulating the balance between the inflammatory phase. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate whether KDM3A could regulate the polarization of macrophages to affect the inflammatory response after myocardial infarction and whether targeting KDM3A could influence the prognosis of myocardial infarction and adverse LV remodeling. To explore the biological function of KDM3A and the underlying mechanisms, the loss of function experiments were designed in vitro and vivo. we analyzed the function of macrophages by a phagocytosis and migration assay and explored the polarization of macrophages. The expression of macrophage -related genes in the acute inflammatory phase and surface markers was detected by western blot and immunofluorescence assays. Echocardiography, Masson's trichrome staining and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were used to detect cardiac ventricular function. Our data showed that KDM3A is essential for the biological function of rat bone marrow macrophages (BMDMs), and KDM3A deficiency decreases the capacity for phagocytosis and migration, promoting M1 but restraining  macrophage phenotype polarization in vitro. Furthermore, we constructed MI models of male rats to verify that KDM3A deficiency could regulate macrophage polarization to aggravate the inflammatory response and accelerate LV remodeling in vivo. Among them, we confirmed that IRF4 is a downstream effector of the KDM3A-dependent pathway which could epigenetically influence the transcription of IRF4 by enhancing histone H3 lysine 9 di-methylation(H3K9me2) accumulation on the IRF4 gene proximal promoter region to modulate macrophage polarization. These results demonstrated that KDM3A plays an essential role in the cardiac repair process of post-MI and LV remodeling by modulating the macrophage phenotype, thereby suggesting a promising therapy to treat post MI injuries.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Dysfunction of this phenotypic switch can result in a population imbalance that leads to chronic wounds or disease due to unresolved . Therapeutic interventions that target macrophages have therefore been proposed and implemented in diseases that feature chronic  such as diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. We have developed a model for the sequential influx of immune cells in the peritoneal cavity in response to a bacterial stimulus that includes macrophage polarization, with the simplifying assumption that macrophages can be classified as M1 or . With this model, we were able to reproduce the expected timing of sequential influx of immune cells and mediators in a general inflammatory setting. We then fit this model to in vivo experimental data obtained from a mouse peritonitis model of , which is widely used to evaluate endogenous processes in response to an inflammatory stimulus. Model robustness is explored with local structural and practical identifiability of the proposed model a posteriori. Additionally, we perform sensitivity analysis that identifies the population of apoptotic neutrophils as a key driver of the inflammatory process. Finally, we simulate a selection of proposed therapies including points of intervention in the case of delayed neutrophil apoptosis, which our model predicts will result in a sustained inflammatory response. Our model can therefore provide hypothesis testing for therapeutic interventions that target macrophage phenotype and predict outcomes to be validated by subsequent experimentation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285429>Mesenchymal stem cells prevent the progression of diabetic nephropathy by improving mitochondrial function in tubular epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>The administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was shown to attenuate overt as well as early diabetic nephropathy in rodents, but the underlying mechanism of this beneficial effect is largely unknown.  and mitochondrial dysfunction are major pathogenic factors in diabetic nephropathy. In this study, we found that the repeated administration of MSCs prevents albuminuria and injury to tubular epithelial cells (TECs), an important element in the progression of diabetic nephropathy, by improving mitochondrial function. The expression of M1 macrophage markers was significantly increased in diabetic kidneys compared with that in control kidneys. Interestingly, the expression of arginase-1 (Arg1), an important  macrophage marker, was reduced in diabetic kidneys and increased by MSC treatment. In cultured TECs, conditioned media from lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages reduced peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (Pgc1a) expression and impaired mitochondrial function. The coculture of macrophages with MSCs increased and decreased the expression of Arg1 and M1 markers, respectively. Treatment with conditioned media from cocultured macrophages prevented activated macrophage-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in TECs. In the absence of MSC coculture, Arg1 overexpression in macrophages reversed Pgc1a suppression in TECs. These observations suggest that MSCs prevent the progression of diabetic nephropathy by reversing mitochondrial dysfunction in TECs via the induction of Arg1 in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261963>Tumor Microenvironment as A "Game Changer" in Cancer Radiotherapy.</a></h2><p>Radiotherapy (RT), besides cancer cells, also affects the tumor microenvironment (TME): tumor blood vessels and cells of the immune system. It damages endothelial cells and causes radiation-induced . Damaged vessels inhibit the infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes into tumors, and immunosuppressive pathways are activated. They lead to the accumulation of radioresistant suppressor cells, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with the  phenotype, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs). The area of tumor hypoxia increases. Hypoxia reduces oxygen-dependent DNA damage and weakens the anti-cancer RT effect. It activates the formation of new blood vessels and leads to cancer relapse after irradiation. Irradiation may also activate the immune response through immunogenic cell death induction. This leads to the "in situ" vaccination effect. In this article, we review how changes in the TME affect radiation-induced anticancer efficacy. There is a very delicate balance between the activation of the immune system and the immunosuppression induced by RT. The effects of RT doses on immune system reactions and also on tumor vascularization remain unclear. A better understanding of these interactions will contribute to the optimization of RT treatment, which may prevent the recurrence of cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663401>Evaluation of M1 and  macrophages in ovarian endometriomas from women affected by endometriosis at different stages of the disease.</a></h2><p>Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent disease defined by the presence and growth of functional endometrial-like tissue, glands and stroma, outside the uterine cavity. Macrophages are broadly classified into pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, and  macrophages, which have selective anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic activities and are able to induce immunotolerance and angiogenesis. Based on these elements, the aim of our study was to evaluate CD14CD68CD197CD80 M1 and CD14CD68CD163CD206  macrophages in tissue samples from ovarian endometriomas of women affected by endometriosis at different stages of the disease. For each patient, we collected a biological sample of the cyst (ovarian endometriomas for cases and ovarian functional cyst for controls) during laparoscopy. We found that the number of both M1 and  macrophages was significantly higher in endometriosis group than controls, regardless of stage ( < .0001 for each stage versus controls). Moreover, our data analysis shows a trend in progressive decrease of M1 macrophages from stage I to stage IV; on the contrary,  macrophages show a specular trend compared to M1 macrophages, with a progressive increase from stage I to stage IV. This may contribute to the pro-inflammatory microenvironment in the early stages of the disease, and to the pro-fibrotic activity of the advanced stages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634798>Muscarinic M1 and  receptor subtypes play opposite roles in LPS-induced septic shock.</a></h2><p>To compare pharmacologic effects of pirenzepine and AF-DX116, a selective competitive antagonist for M1 and  subtype muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs), respectively, with atropine, a non-selective competitive antagonist for mAChRs, on Lipopolysaccharide (LPS).Male C57BL/6 mice were used to establish models of LPS-induced experimental endotoxemia. Mice were intraperitoneally injected 10 min prior to LPS injection with control (saline), atropine, pirenzepine and AF-DX116, respectively. Overall survival time was estimated using Kaplan-Meier plots. Inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was monitored at various intervals after LPS injection and individual reagent administration. Pathological alternations in lungs and liver were analyzed.Pirenzepine and atropine pretreatment improved survival rate of LPS-induced septic shock; in contrast, AF-DX116 accelerated death from sepsis. Moreover, TNF-α plasma level was decreased in response to pirenzepine or atropine, whereas increased in response to AF-DX116. Pirenzepine and atropine relieved whereas AF-DX116 accelerated LPS-induced pulmonary and hepatic injury. Pirenzepine reduced proportion of M1 subtype of macrophages, while AF-DX116 promoted polarization of macrophages to M1 subtype. Pirenzepine pretreatment reduced while AF-DX116 enhanced expression of SOCS3 at mRNA level.The administration of pirenzepine and atropine may have beneficial effects on septic shock.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Of these, 616 were seen again 3 y later for the longitudinal analysis. Energy-adjusted DII (E-DII) was calculated from a validated diet history questionnaire. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using DXA. Twenty-four inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed. Incident falls over 3 y were determined through telephone interviews every 4 mo. Multiple regression, linear mixed effects models, negative binomial regression, and mediation analysis were utilized in this study.A higher E-DII score (indicating a more proinflammatory diet) was associated with higher concentrations of IL-6 (β: 0.028 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.053), IL-7 (β: 0.020 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.037), and TNF-α (β: 0.027 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.051). A higher E-DII score was also associated with lower appendicular lean mass adjusted for BMI (ALMBMI) (β: -0.006 kg/; 95% CI: -0.010, -0.001). For every unit increase in E-DII (range: -4.91 to +3.66 units), incident falls rates increased by 13% (incidence rate ratio: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.21) over 3 y. Mediation analysis showed that the association between E-DII and 3-y incident falls was influenced by the concentrations of IL-7 by 24%. There was no association between E-DII and BMD.Consumption of a proinflammatory diet was associated with increased concentrations of IL-6, IL-7, and TNF-α; increased falls risk; and lower ALMBMI in community-dwelling older men.

Here, we sought to elucidate the fundamental mechanism by which miR-511-3p attenuates allergic  and promotes macrophage polarization. Compared with WT mice, the allergen-challenged Mrc1-/- mice showed increased airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and . However, this increased AHR and  were significantly attenuated when these mice were pretransduced with adeno-associated virus-miR-511-3p (AAV-miR-511-3p). Gene expression profiling of macrophages identified Ccl2 as one of the major genes that was highly expressed in  macrophages but antagonized by miR-511-3p. The interaction between miR-511-3p and Ccl2 was confirmed by in silico analysis and mRNA-miR pulldown assay. Further evidence for the inhibition of Ccl2 by miR-511-3p was given by reduced levels of Ccl2 in supernatants of miR-511-3p-transduced macrophages and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of AAV-miR-511-3p-infected Mrc1-/- mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Ccl2 promotes M1 macrophage polarization by activating RhoA signaling through Ccr2. The interaction between Ccr2 and RhoA was also supported by coimmunoprecipitation assay. Importantly, inhibition of RhoA signaling suppressed cockroach allergen-induced AHR and lung . These findings suggest a potentially novel mechanism by which miR-511-3p regulates allergic  and macrophage polarization by targeting Ccl2 and its downstream Ccr2/RhoA axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391270>Attenuation of Equine Lentivirus Alters Mitochondrial Protein Expression Profile from  to Apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is an equine lentivirus similar to HIV-1, targets host immune cells, and causes a life-long infection in horses. The Chinese live EIAV vaccine is attenuated from long-term passaging of a highly virulent strain  The parent pathogenic strain (EIAV) induces a host inflammatory storm to cause severe pathological injury of animals. However, the vaccine strain (EIAV) induces a high level of apoptosis to eliminate infected cells. To investigate how these processes are regulated, we performed a comparative proteomics analysis and functional study in equine monocyte-derived macrophages (eMDMs) and found that the divergent mitochondrial protein expression profiles caused by EIAV strains with different virulence led to disparate mitochondrial function, morphology, and metabolism. This in turn promoted the distinct transformation of macrophage inflammatory polarization and intrinsic apoptosis. In EIAV-infected cells, a high level of glycolysis and increased mitochondrial fragmentation were induced, resulting in the M1-polarized proinflammatory-type transformation of macrophages and the subsequent production of a strong inflammatory response. Following infection with EIAV, the infected cells were transformed into -polarized anti-inflammatory macrophages by inhibition of glycolysis. In this case, a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and impairment of the electron transport chain led to increased levels of apoptosis and reactive oxygen species. These results correlated with viral pathogenicity loss and may help provide an understanding of the key mechanism of lentiviral attenuation. Following viral infection, the working pattern and function of the cell can be transformed through the impact on mitochondria. It still unknown how the mitochondrial response changes in cells infected with viruses in the process of virulence attenuation. EIAV is the only effective lentiviral vaccine for large-scale use in the world. EIAV is the parent pathogenic strain. Unlike EIAV-induced  storms, EIAV can induce high levels of apoptosis. For the first time, we found that, after the mitochondrial protein expression profile is altered, EIAV-infected cells are transformed into M1-polarized-type macrophages and cause inflammatory injury and that the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is activated in EIAV-infected cells. These studies shed light on how the mitochondrial protein expression profile changes between cells infected by pathogenic lentivirus strains and cells infected by attenuated lentivirus strains to drive different cellular responses, especially from  to apoptosis.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600749>Rapid Progression of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: Urinary Biomarkers as Predictors.</a></h2><p>Markers currently used to predict the likelihood of rapid disease progression in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) are expensive and time consuming to assess and often have limited sensitivity. New, easy-to-measure markers are therefore needed that alone or in combination with conventional risk markers can predict the rate of disease progression. In the present study, we investigated the ability of tubular damage and  markers to predict kidney function decline.At baseline, albumin, immunoglobulin G, kidney injury molecule 1, β2 microglobulin (β2MG), heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 -(MCP-1) were measured in 24-h urine samples of patients participating in a study investigating the therapeutic efficacy of lanreotide in ADPKD. Individual change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during follow-up was calculated using mixed-model analysis taking into account 13 -eGFRs (chronic kidney disease EPIdemiology) per patient. Logistic regression analysis was used to select urinary biomarkers that had the best association with rapidly progressive disease. The predictive value of these selected urinary biomarkers was compared to other risk scores using C-statistics.Included were 302 patients of whom 53.3% were female, with an average age of 48 ± 7 years, eGFR of 52 ± 12 mL/min/1.73 , and a height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) of 1,082 (736-1,669) mL/m. At baseline, all urinary damage and  markers were associated with baseline eGFR, also after adjustment for age, sex and baseline htTKV. For longitudinal analyses only patients randomized to standard care were considered (n = 152). A stepwise backward analysis revealed that β2MG and MCP-1 showed the strongest association with rapidly progressive disease. A urinary biomarker score was created by summing the ranking of tertiles of β2MG and MCP-1 excretion. The predictive value of this urinary biomarker score was higher compared to that of the Mayo htTKV classification (area under the curve [AUC] 0.73 [0.64-0.82] vs. 0.61 [0.51-0.71], p = 0.04) and comparable to that of the predicting renal outcomes in -ADPKD score (AUC 0.73 [0.64-0.82] vs. 0.65 [0.55-0.75], p = 0.18). In a second independent cohort with better kidney function, similar results were found for the urinary biomarker score.Measurement of urinary β2MG and MCP-1 excretion allows selection of ADPKD patients with rapidly progressive disease, with a predictive value comparable to or even higher than that of TKV or PKD mutation. Easy and inexpensive to measure urinary markers therefore hold promise to help predict prognosis in ADPKD.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

There is evidence that immunomodulation, via type 2 helper T-cells (Th2) cytokines, exerts neuroprotection after ischemia. We investigated the consequences of simultaneous genetic deletion of Th2 cytokines (IL [interleukin]-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13) on the histopathologic outcome, microglia and infiltrated macrophages markers, and ischemic microenvironment at different time points after ischemic injury in mice subjected to permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Methods- Wild-type and Th2 cytokine-deficient mice (4KO) were subjected to permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery by electrocoagulation and followed up to 5 weeks after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Neuropathologic outcome was assessed at 24 hours (n=6), 7 days (n=6), and 5 weeks (n=6-7) by examination of the ischemic lesion, neuronal count, microglia and infiltrated macrophages markers, brain atrophy, collagen deposition, and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) immunohistochemistry. Selected gene expression was investigated at 7 days (n=6). Results- 4KO mice showed no difference in lesion and neuronal count 7 days and up to 5 weeks after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery compared with wild type. Ischemic 4KO mice had lower CD16/32 expression at 24 hours, lower CD11b and CD16/32 expression at 7 days than wild type. They had higher CD206 expression at 24 hours, higher CD206 and arginase1 at 7 days, and increased mRNA for CXCL9 (chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 9) compared with wild type. Additional histopathologic analysis, including brain atrophy, gliotic scar, and collagenous scar confirmed no difference between genotypes at 5 weeks. Conclusions- This study casts light on the proposed neuroprotective function of Th2 cytokines, showing that combined IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13 deletion does not affect the neuropathologic response to ischemic stroke in the subacute and chronic phases. Our findings indicate that Th2 cytokines are not an essential neuroimmunological cue able to drive the brain's ischemic outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528256>Macrophage phenotypes and Gas6/Axl signaling in apical lesions.</a></h2><p>Macrophages participate in the periapical  with pro-inflammatory M1 cells and anti-inflammatory  cells.

Recent genome-wide transcriptomic analyses of microglial cells under different disease conditions have uncovered a new subpopulation named disease-associated microglia (DAM). These studies have challenged the classical view of the microglia polarization state's proinflammatory M1 (classical activation) and immunosuppressive  (alternative activation). Molecular signatures of DAM and proinflammatory microglia (highly pro-oxidant) have shown clear differences, yet a partial overlapping gene profile is evident between both phenotypes. The switch activation of homeostatic microglia into reactive microglia relies on the selective activation of key surface receptors involved in the maintenance of brain homeostasis (a.k.a. pattern recognition receptors, PRRs). Two relevant PRRs are toll-like receptors (TLRs) and triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2), whose selective activation is believed to generate either a proinflammatory or a DAM phenotype, respectively. However, the recent identification of endogenous disease-related ligands, which bind to and activate both TLRs and TREM2, anticipates the existence of rather complex microglia responses. Examples of potential endogenous dual ligands include amyloid β, galectin-3, and apolipoprotein E.

Cartilage matrix degradation, production of proinflammatory mediators, chondrocyte apoptosis and activation of macrophages in the synovial are involved in OA pathogenesis. Current non-surgical therapies for OA mainly aim at relieving pain but can barely alleviate the progression of OA. Quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid has shown potent anti-inflammatory effects, however, its effects and underlying mechanisms on OA have seldom been systematically illuminated. In this study, we explored the protective effects of quercetin on repairing OA-induced cartilage injuries and its possible mechanisms. In vitro, quercetin remarkably suppressed the expression of matrix degrading proteases and inflammatory mediators, meantime promoted the production of cartilage anabolic factors in interleukin-1β-induced (IL-1β) rat chondrocytes. In addition, quercetin exhibited anti-apoptotic effects by decreasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), restoring mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and inhibiting the Caspase-3 pathway in apoptotic rat chondrocytes. Moreover, quercetin induced  polarization of macrophages and upregulated the expression of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which in turn created a pro-chondrogenic microenvironment for chondrocytes and promoted the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in chondrocytes. In vivo, intra-articular injection of quercetin alleviated the degradation of the cartilage and the apoptosis of chondrocytes in a rat OA model. Moreover, the expression of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 in the synovial fluid and the ratio of  macrophages in the synovial membrane were elevated. In summary, our study proves that quercetin exerts chondroprotective effects by inhibiting  and apoptosis of chondrocytes, modulating synovial macrophages polarization to  macrophages and creating a pro-chondrogenic environment for chondrocytes to enhance cartilage repair under OA environment. It is suggested that quercetin may serve as a potential drug for OA treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

With the aging of society, poor diet control, social, psychological and other risk factors in our country, the incidence of myocardial infarction and hypertension is reported to increase yearly. Many treatment methods have effectively delayed the occurrence of ventricular remodeling. However, in order to prevent and delay the occurrence and development of ventricular remodeling, the new treatment strategy cannot be ignored.In this study, we used male C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old), weight 23 g-27 g, SPF grade. According to the established methods of the research group, the left anterior descending branch of the coronary artery (LAD) was used to make the model of myocardial ischemia, and which was evaluated by the change of EF value in mice. The experiment included seven groups: sham operation group, model group, metoprolol group, puerarin group, tanshinone IIA group, tanshinone IIA: puerarin =1:1 group, tanshinone IIA: puerarin =1:2 group. The changes of cardiac function in each group were observed by echocardiography and hemodynamics after the drug delivery cycle was 3d, 7d, 14d and 28d. Detection of 3d serum enzyme indexes LDH, CK and CK-MB by automatic biochemical analyzer. The expression of CD11b, F4/80, Ly6C in cardiac tissues were detected by flow cytometry at 3d and 7d. The expression of IL-1β and TNF- α in serum were detected by ELISA. IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, iNOS and other related genes were detected by RT-PCR method. HE, Masson staining and immunohistochemical staining were used to observe the changes of myocardial histomorphology in mice. We also examined the effects of different drug treatments on the proliferation and function of Raw264.7 cells, H9C2 cells and HUVECs. Western blot examined the effects of different drug treatments on the expression of inflammatory pathway related proteins TLR4 and C/EBP-β.1. Echocardiographic results showed that with the prolongation of ischemic time, the ejection fraction of the model group, the shortening rate of the short axis of the left ventricle, the flow rate of the outflow tract were significantly decreased, and the structure of the ventricle was significantly changed. Hemodynamic tests showed that the maximum and maximum rate of decline in the post-ischemia model group were significantly reduced, with increased systolic and diastolic volume, and a decrease in pressure difference. After treatment with drugs, all groups improved, but tanshinone IIA: puerarin = 1:1 group can significantly improve the above indicators after 28d of administration, which can effectively relieve the deterioration of cardiac function caused by acute myocardial infarction. 2. After administration for 3 and 7 days, the inflammatory cell CD11b monocytes and the F4/80 phenotype macrophages in heart tissue were detected by flow cytometry, and it was found that tanshinone IIA: puerarin = 1:1 can inhibit the release of inflammatory cells. The results of RT-PCR showed that the tanshinone IIA: puerarin = 1:1 group significantly improved the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and iNOS. In the immunohistochemical analysis of iNOS and Arg-1, the tanshinone IIA and puerarin 1:1 treatment group was able to inhibit the expression of M1 macrophages in the early stage of  and promote the expression of  macrophages. 3. The cardiac index increased significantly and the serum TGF-β increased after 28d. The combination of tanshinone IIA and puerarin could significantly reduce these indexes. HE, Masson, Sirius red and immunohistochemical staining were found in the combination of tanshinone IIA and puerarin can significantly reduce the structure of acute ischemic myocardial cell damage and interstitial edema, reduce collagen synthesis, and fibroblasts release, thereby inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and heart remodeling. 4. MTT assay showed a significantly greater proliferation of above two cells types treated with tanshinone IIA: puerarin =1:1 and more nodes and meshes were found in tanshinone IIA: puerarin =1:1 group compared with other groups. 5. The combination of tanshinone IIA and puerarin could regulate  through inhibiting the expression of TLR4 protein, but up-regulating the expression of C/EBP-β protein.The combination of tanshinone IIA and puerarin inhibits the immersion of inflammatory cells. Improving hemodynamics by improving cardiac function, reducing the destruction of cardiac myocytes, reducing collagen synthesis, inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and ventricular remodeling. Through the whole experiment, tanshinone IIA: puerarin = 1:1 is the best.Copyright © 2019.

Lactobacilli are part of the human microbiota and have been studied as an adjunct treatment in  eradication therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which lactobacilli act against  infection have not been fully characterized. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of  strains upon coincubation of host macrophages with . We found that  Kx110A1 (L. gas), a strain isolated from a human stomach, but not other tested  species, blocked the production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 in -infected macrophages. Interestingly, L. gas also inhibited the release of these cytokines in LPS or LTA stimulated macrophages, demonstrating a general anti-inflammatory property. The inhibition of these cytokines did not occur through the polarization of macrophages from the M1 (proinflammatory) to  (anti-inflammatory) phenotype or through the altered viability of  or host cells. Instead, we show that L. gas suppressed the release of TNF and IL-6 by reducing the expression of ADAM17 (also known as TNF-alpha-converting enzyme, TACE) on host cells. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which L. gas prevents the production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 in host macrophages.Copyright © 2019 Gebremariam, Qazi, Somiah, Pathak, Sjölinder, Sverremark Ekström and Jonsson.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31229505>Up-regulated cathepsin C induces macrophage M1 polarization through FAK-triggered p38 MAPK/NF-κB pathway.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence indicates that in response to environmental changes, macrophages can dynamically change into two main functional phenotypes, namely M1 and . Depending on these different phenotypes, macrophages can produce either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory factors which may affect the outcome of . Mastering the switching of M1/ phenotypes may provide therapeutic approaches to chronic inflammatory disease, such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, even the metabolic disorders. Cathepsin C (CTSC), as a member of the papain family of cysteine proteases, is a key enzyme in the activation of granule serine proteases thereby involved in modulating the inflammatory responses. Moreover, abundant expression of CTSC has been found in M1 macrophages in plaques of atherosclerosis and related to the progression of disease. However, whether CTSC can regulate macrophage activation status in inflammatory responses has not been fully investigated. In the present study, using peritoneal macrophages (PMs) and mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 treated with LPS and active monomer of CTSC, we found that CTSC was not only expressed in macrophages in M1 activation status, but also facilitated macrophages towards M1 phenotype, suggesting a self-activation mechanism involved in this process which may lead to a vicious circle in chronic . Then we attempted to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of CTSC resulting in M1 activation. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is one of the non-receptor cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases, serving as an upstream mediator that leads to transcription of many pro-inflammatory factors. We found FAK expression was up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels following CTSC stimulation, and FAK phosphorylation level was also significantly increased. The p38MAPK/NF-κB pathway, as the downstream of FAK, were also found activated in CTSC-treated macrophages, suggesting that CTSC may promote macrophage towards M1 activation status through FAK-induced p38MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway activation.

In addition to playing a central role during embryogenesis, this pathway is also an essential part of adult homeostasis. Indeed, it controls the proliferation of epithelial cells in different organs such as intestine, lung, and kidney, and guarantees the maintenance of the mucosa in physiological conditions. The origin of this molecular pathway is the binding between Wnt ligands (belonging to a family of 19 different homologous secreted glycoproteins) and their specific membrane receptors, from the Frizzled receptor family. This specific interaction triggers the activation of the signaling cascade, which in turn activates or suppresses the expression of different genes in order to change the behavior of the cell. On the other hand, alterations of this pathway have been described in pathological conditions such as , fibrosis, and cancer. In recent years, macrophages-among other cell types-have emerged as a potential source of Wnt ligands. Due to their high plasticity, macrophages, which are central to the innate immune response, are capable of adopting different phenotypes depending on their microenvironment. In the past, two different phenotypes were described: a proinflammatory phenotype-M1 macrophages-and an anti-inflammatory phenotype- macrophages-and a selective expression of Wnt ligands has been associated with said phenotypes. However, nowadays it is assumed that macrophages  move through a continual spectrum of functional phenotypes. In both physiological and pathological (, fibrosis and cancer) conditions, the accumulation and polarization of macrophages conditions the future of the tissue, facilitating various scenarios, such as resolution of , activation of fibrosis, and cancer development due to the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, in autocrine and paracrine manner.

Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), also known as breast regression protein 39 (BRP-39) in mice and human homologue YKL-40, plays important roles in Th2  and allergen sensitization. CHI3L1 has been implicated in a variety of diseases including asthma characterized by , apoptosis and tissue remodelling, but its role in AD remains elusive.The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CHI3L1 in the development and progression of AD.We investigated YKL-40 levels in the serum and skin of AD patients by ELISA and immunofluorescence, respectively. Using a murine model of AD induced by ovalbumin (OVA), we investigated Th2 immune responses,  macrophage activation and skin barrier gene expression using wild-type (WT) and BRP-39 null mutant (BRP-39 ) mice. YKL-40 level was significantly increased in serum of AD patients. In addition, both mRNA and protein expression levels of BRP-39 were higher in OVA-sensitized WT mice than in control mice. OVA-sensitized BRP-39 mice showed decreased epidermal thickness, lower total serum IgE, Th2 cytokine levels and CD4 effector T cell populations than OVA-sensitized WT mice. Induction of BRP-39 was dominant in dermal macrophages. BRP-39 deficiency was found to be involved in  macrophage activation. Consistently, the YKL-40 level in the skin of AD patients was higher than in normal subjects and it was expressed in dermal macrophages. BRP-39 deficiency attenuated dysregulation of skin barrier and tight junction genes.These findings demonstrate that CHI3L1 mediates the development of AD induced by OVA, affecting Th2 ,  macrophage activation and skin barrier function.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408586>Lycopene Alleviates Obesity-Induced  and Insulin Resistance by Regulating M1/ Status of Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) recruitment and polarization are pivotal in the development of insulin resistance.

Flow cytometry analysis of ATMs demonstrates that lycopene attenuated the increased number of ATMs in HF diet-fed mice. In addition, HF+LY mice have 23% fewer M1-polarized ATMs and 60% more -polarized ATMs than HF mice, resulting in the predominance of  over M1 in the ATM population. -dominant polarization is also seen in hepatic macrophages in HF+LY mice.

The present study investigated the potential role of autophagy in stress-related IBD in patients and animal model. The correlation between psychosocial stress and intestinal autophagy was determined in 23 patients with IBD. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a well-established inducer of psychosocial stress, was administrated in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). In IBD patients, the autophagy markers beclin-1, LC3-II/I ratio, Atg16L1, and Atg4B were significantly enhanced. The psychosocial stress score was positively associated with the levels of beclin-1 and the LC3II/I ratio in intestinal biopsy specimens. In IBD mouse model, CRH significantly aggravated intestinal , increased Paneth cell metaplasia, and enhanced intestinal autophagy (beclin-1, Atg16L1, PIK3R4, and Atg4B upregulation; GAA, CTSD, and PPKAA1 downregulation). Additionally, the CRH-induced gut microbial dysbiosis was evidenced by a marked increase in the number of detrimental bacteria. In LPS-stimulated BMDM, CRH substantially increased M1/ polarization and thus promoted . In both IBD mice and LPS-treated BMDM, blockade of autophagy by chloroquine abrogated the unbeneficial effects of CRH, whereas autophagy inducer rapamycin resulted in a pronounced protective effect against IBD lesion. Our data demonstrate that psychosocial stress may link the enhanced intestinal autophagy by modulating gut microbiota and  to aggravate IBD.

This effect was markedly amplified with conditioned media from  macrophage/PASMC co-cultures. CCR2, CCR5, CCL2 and CCL5 were upregulated in macrophage/PASMC co-cultures. Compared to inhibiting either receptor, dual CCR2 and CCR5 inhibition more strongly attenuated the growth-promoting effect of conditioned media from -macrophage/PASMC co-cultures. Deleting either CCR2 or CCR5 in macrophages or PASMCs attenuated the growth response. In mice with hypoxia- or SUGEN/hypoxia-induced PH, targeting both CCR2 and CCR5 prevented or reversed PH more efficiently than targeting either receptor alone. Patients with PAH exhibited CCR2 and CCR5 upregulation in PASMCs and perivascular macrophages compared to controls. The PASMC growth-promoting effect of conditioned media from -macrophage/PASMC co-cultures was greater when PASMCs from PAH patients were used in the co-cultures or as the target cells and was dependent on CCR2 and CCR5. PASMC migration toward -macrophages was greater with PASMCs from PAH patients and was attenuated by blocking CCR2 and CCR5.CCR2 and CCR5 are required for collaboration between macrophages and PASMCs to initiate and amplify PASMC migration and proliferation during PAH development.

Dehydrocostus lactone induced apoptotic cell death in 12Z human endometriotic cells. Dehydrocostus lactone stimulated the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, while caspase inhibitors significantly reversed the dehydrocostus lactone-induced cell death in 12Z cells. In addition, dehydrocostus lactone decreased the production of PGE and neurotrophins (BDNF, NGF, NT3, and NT4/5), which are regarded as endometriosis-associated pain factors in human endometriotic cells. Moreover, dehydrocostus lactone inhibited the expression of  markers (CD206, and Trem-2), IL-10, VEGF, and MMP-2/-9 in endometriosis-associated macrophages (EAMs).

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are among the inflammatory cells that greatly influence cancer. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), macrophages can either stimulate or inhibit tumorigenesis. TAMs that stimulate tumor cell proliferation (-phenotype) enrich the TME with growth factors and immunosuppressive molecules, whereas tumor inhibitory TAMs (M1-phenotype) initiate the immune response to dampen tumor progression. Shifting between phenotypes is controlled by several components of the TME. Targeting macrophages, specifically inhibiting  TAMs, has been introduced successfully in cancer immunotherapy. However, signaling mechanisms underlining TAM polarization are largely unknown. This review analyzed studies of the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as a determinant of macrophage polarization. It is proposed that activation of MAPK, particularly extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38, might favor the differentiation into  TAMs. Thus, pharmacological modification of MAPK pathways will potentially offer exciting new targets in cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660091>Immunomodulatory aspects in the progression and treatment of oral malignancy.</a></h2><p> substantially affects the risk of oral malignancy. Pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-γ, confers anti-tumor activity using several different mechanisms. Conversely, higher expression of interleukin (IL)-17 is associated with worse prognosis. Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 correlates positively with poor long-term survival of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. IL-1α affects cancer associated fibroblasts and macrophages, and promote several malignant phenotypes including immune suppression. Some anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, relate to pro-tumoral activities. Among immune checkpoint modulators, programmed death (PD-)1 and PD-ligand (L)1 facilitate oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell evasion from immune surveillance, and the expression status of these has a prognostic value. OSCCs contain tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) as major stromal cells of their tumor microenvironment. Among the two distinctive states,  macrophages support tumor invasion, metastasis and immune suppression. Crosstalk between TAMs and OSCC or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) plays an important role in the progression of OSCC. Clinical trials with blocking antibodies against IL-1α or melanoma-associated antigens have been reported as therapeutic approaches against OSCCs. The most promising approach activating antitumor immunity is the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 axis.

Several studies have demonstrated that the macrophage polarization state and immune response play critical roles in periprosthetic osteolysis and tissue repair, but the immunomodulatory role of lithium chloride (LiCl), which has a protective effect on wear particle-induced osteolysis by suppressing osteoclasts and attenuating inflammatory responses, has never been investigated.In this work, the immunomodulatory capability of LiCl on titanium (Ti) nanoparticle-stimulated transformation of macrophage phenotypes and the subsequent effect on osteogenic differentiation were investigated. We first speculated that LiCl attenuated Ti nanoparticle-stimulated  responses by driving macrophage polarization and generating an immune micro-environment to improve osteogenesis. Furthermore, a metal nanoparticle-stimulated murine air pouch inflammatory model was applied to confirm this protective effect in vivo.The results revealed that metal nanoparticles significantly activate M1 phenotype (proinflammatory macrophage) expression and increase proinflammatory cytokines secretions in vitro and in vivo, whereas LiCl drives macrophages to the  phenotype (anti-inflammatory macrophage) and increases the release of anti-inflammatory and bone-related cytokines. This improved the osteogenic differentiation capability of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs). In addition, we also provided evidence that LiCl inhibits the phosphorylation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in wear particle-treated macrophages.LiCl has the immunomodulatory effects to alleviate Ti nanoparticle-mediated inflammatory reactions and enhance the osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs by driving macrophage polarization.

Liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells, KCs) and oxidative stress play critical roles in the pathogenesis of toxin-induced liver injury. Here, we evaluated the role of oxidative stress in regulating KC polarization against acetaminophen (APAP)-mediated acute liver injury in a streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic murine model. Compared to the controls, hyperglycemic mice exhibited a significant increase in liver injury and intrahepatic . KCs obtained from hyperglycemic mice secreted higher levels of the proinflammatory factors, such as TNF-α and IL-6, lower levels of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10. Furthermore, enhanced oxidative stress was revealed by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in KCs from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment. In addition, ROS inhibitor NAC resulted in a significant decrease of ROS production in hyperglycemic KCs from mice posttreated with APAP. We also analyzed the role of hyperglycemia in macrophage M1/ polarization. Interestingly, we found that hyperglycemia promoted M1 polarization, but inhibited  polarization of KCs obtained from APAP-exposed livers, as evidenced by increased MCP-1 and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) gene induction but decreased Arg-1 and CD206 gene induction accompanied by increased STAT1 activation and decreased STAT6 activation. NAC restored Arg-1, CD206 gene induction, and STAT6 activation. To explore the mechanism how hyperglycemia regulates KCs polarization against APAP-induced acute liver injury, we examined the AMPK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and found decreased AMPK activation and increased AKT activation in liver and KCs from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment. AMPK activation by its agonist AICAR or PI3K inhibition by its antagonist LY294002 inhibited ROS production in KCs from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment and significantly attenuated APAP-induced liver injury in the hyperglycemic mice, compared to the control mice.

In our study we wanted to show the fundamental histological parameters to be evaluated during the development of an infarction on an experimental model as well as treatment with mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue applied intra-lesionally. The fundamental parameters to study in infarcted tissue at the histological level are the cells involved in the inflammatory process (lymphocytes, macrophages and , neutrophils, mast cells and plasma cells), neovascularization processes (capillaries and arterioles) and cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes and Purkinje fibers). In our study, we used intramyocardial injection of mesenchymal stem cells into the myocardial infarction area 1 hour after arterial occlusion and allowed 1 month of evolution before analyzing the modifications on the normal tissue inflammatory infiltrate. Acute  was shortened, leading to chronic  with abundant plasma cells and mast cells and complete disappearance of neutrophils. Another benefit was an increase in the number of vessels formed.

We found that up-regulation of both M1 and  markers co-existed up to 30 days after sepsis induction. In addition, minocycline induced a down-regulation, predominantly, of M1 markers. Our results suggest early activation of M1 microglia that is followed by an overlap of both M1 and  phenotypes and that the beneficial effects of minocycline on sepsis-associated brain dysfunction may be related to its effects predominantly on the M1 phenotype.© 2019 The Authors.

Interleukin-25 (IL-25) promotes type 2 immunity via alternative activation of macrophages, and is closely associated with -related diseases, even malignancies. However, it is not clear which role IL-25 plays in the development of HCC, and whether gut microbiota are involved.IL-25 was detected by ELISA, Western blotting (WB), and immunohistochemistry. Chemokines were measured by RT-qPCR and WB. After co-culture with IL-25-stimulated macrophages, the cell growth, migration, invasion and EMT marker of HCC cell lines (MHCC97L and HepG2) were evaluated by Brdu proliferation, Transwell assays and WB. An antibody neutralization assay of chemokine CXCL10 was performed to confirm its role in HCC development. Furthermore, the effects of IL-25 in HCC were investigated in vivo. Dysbiosis of gut microflora was induced by antibiotics (vancomycin, cefoperazone or combination of ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin). We used feces suspension to treat colonic epithelial NCM460 cells, and detected IL-25 and tuft cell marker DCLK1 using WB and immunofluorescence staining.We found that the level of IL-25 was significantly elevated in HCC patients, and was negatively correlated with survival rate after hepatectomy. However, IL-25 did not directly promote the development of HCC cells. Then, we observed the significant positive correlation between IL-25 level and  percentage (CD206/CD68) in HCC tumors. In vitro and in vivo, IL-25 induced alternative activation of macrophages promoted HCC cell migration, invasion and tumorigenesis, increased the expression of vimentin, Snail and phospho-ERK, and decreased the expression of E-cadherin in HCC cells. After IL-25 treatment, chemokine CXCL10 was increased in macrophages. Neutralizing CXCL10 in macrophage-conditioned medium reversed the IL-25-mediated effect on HCC cells. Vancomycin-induced dysbiosis promoted the growth of orthotopic HCC homograft. Surprisedly, we found the hyperplasia of colonic epithelial tuft cells, from which more IL-25 was secreted .IL-25 promotes the progression of HCC through inducing alternative activation and CXCL10 secretion of macrophages in tumor microenvironment, and IL-25 secretion may partly result from hyperplastic epithelial tuft cells in colon, induced by gut microbiota dysbiosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365320>The interplay between microglial states and major risk factors in Alzheimer's disease through the eyes of single-cell RNA-sequencing: beyond black and white.</a></h2><p>Microglia constitute ~10-20% of glial cells in the adult human brain. They are the resident phagocytic immune cells of the central nervous system and play an integral role as first responders during . Microglia are commonly classified as "HM" (homeostatic), "M1" (classically activated proinflammatory), or "" (alternatively activated). Multiple single-cell RNA-sequencing studies suggest that this discrete classification system does not accurately and fully capture the vast heterogeneity of microglial states in the brain. In fact, a recent single-cell RNA-sequencing study showed that microglia exist along a continuous spectrum of states. This spectrum spans heterogeneous populations of homeostatic and neuropathology-associated microglia in both healthy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse brains. Major risk factors, such as sex, age, and genes, modulate microglial states, suggesting that shifts along the trajectory might play a causal role in AD pathogenesis. This study provides important insight into the cellular mechanisms of AD and underlines the potential of novel cell-based therapies for AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634818>Pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase reduces NADPH oxidase expression, oxidative stress and the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice; potential implications for human atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) are instrumental in all inflammatory phases of atherosclerosis. Dysregulated histone deacetylase (HDAC)-related epigenetic pathways have been mechanistically linked to alterations in gene expression in experimental models of cardiovascular disorders. Hitherto, the relation between HDAC and Nox in atherosclerosis is not known. We aimed at uncovering whether HDAC plays a role in mediating Nox up-regulation, oxidative stress, , and atherosclerotic lesion progression. Human non-atherosclerotic and atherosclerotic arterial samples, ApoE-/- mice, and in vitro polarized monocyte-derived M1/-macrophages (Mac) were examined. Male ApoE-/- mice, maintained on normal or high-fat, cholesterol-rich diet, were randomized to receive 10 mg/kg suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a pan-HDAC inhibitor, or its vehicle, for 4 weeks. In the human/animal studies, real-time PCR, Western blot, lipid staining, lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were employed. The protein levels of class I, class IIa, class IIb, and class IV HDAC isoenzymes were significantly elevated both in human atherosclerotic tissue samples and in atherosclerotic aorta of ApoE-/- mice. Treatment of ApoE-/- mice with SAHA reduced significantly the extent of atherosclerotic lesions, and the aortic expression of Nox subtypes, NADPH-stimulated ROS production, oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory markers. Significantly up-regulated HDAC and Nox subtypes were detected in inflammatory M1-Mac. In these cells, SAHA reduced the Nox1/2/4 transcript levels. Collectively, HDAC inhibition reduced atherosclerotic lesion progression in ApoE-/- mice, possibly by intertwined mechanisms involving negative regulation of Nox expression and . The data propose that HDAC-oriented pharmacological interventions could represent an effective therapeutic strategy in atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of IL-33-overexpressing bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (IL33-MSCs) on myocardial infarction (MI) and detected the inflammatory level and cardiac function in rats.First, we evaluated the proliferation of T cells and polarization of macrophages that had been co-cultured with Vector-MSCs or IL33-MSCs. Co-culture experiments indicated that IL33-MSCs reduced T cell proliferation and enhanced CD206 macrophage polarization. Second, we determined the  level and cardiac function of PBS-, Vector-MSC-, and IL33-MSC-injected rats. Echocardiography indicated that left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was enhanced in IL33-MSC-injected rats compared with Vector-MSC-injected rats. Postmortem analysis of rat heart tissue showed reduced fibrosis and less  in IL33-MSC-injected rats.These studies indicated that the IL33-MSC injection improved heart function and reduces  in rats with MI compared with PBS or Vector-MSC injections.

The primary endpoints of the study were to assess (i) vascular reactivity and (ii) atherosclerotic disease severity, by Echo-Doppler imaging, histology and ultrastructural analysis. Moreover, we assessed the capacity of the LAV-BPIFB4 protein to shift monocyte-derived macrophages of atherosclerotic mice and patients towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. LAV-BPIFB4 gene therapy rescued endothelial function of mesenteric and femoral arteries from ApoE-/- mice; this effect was blunted by AMD3100, a CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) inhibitor. LAV-BPIFB4-treated mice showed a CXCR4-mediated shift in the balance between Ly6Chigh/Ly6Clow monocytes and /M1 macrophages, along with decreased T cell proliferation and elevated circulating levels of interleukins IL-23 and IL-27. In vitro conditioning with LAV-BPIFB4 protein of macrophages from atherosclerotic patients resulted in a CXCR4-dependent  polarization phenotype. Furthermore, LAV-BPIFB4 treatment of arteries explanted from atherosclerotic patients increased the release of atheroprotective IL-33, while inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory IL-1β, inducing endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation and restoring endothelial function. Finally, significantly lower plasma BPIFB4 was detected in patients with pathological carotid stenosis (>25%) and intima media thickness >2 mm.Transfer of the LAV of BPIFB4 reduces the atherogenic process and skews macrophages towards an -resolving phenotype through modulation of CXCR4, thus opening up novel therapeutic possibilities in cardiovascular disease.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here we used a murine model of house dust mite-induced (HDM-induced) allergic  followed by Ascaris infection to demonstrate that allergic sensitization drives an eosinophil-rich pulmonary type 2 immune response (Th2 cells,  macrophages, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, IL-33, IL-4, IL-13, and mucus) that directly hinders larval development and reduces markedly the parasite burden in the lungs. This effect is dependent on the presence of eosinophils, as eosinophil-deficient mice were unable to limit parasite development or numbers. In vivo administration of neutralizing antibodies against CD4 prior to HDM sensitization significantly reduced eosinophils in the lungs, resulting in the reversal of the HDM-induced Ascaris larval killing. Our data suggest that HDM allergic sensitization drives a response that mimics a primary Ascaris infection, such that CD4+ Th2-mediated eosinophil-dependent helminth larval killing in the lung tissue occurs. This study provides insight into the mechanisms underlying tissue-specific responses that drive a protective response against the early stages of the helminths prior to their establishing long-lasting infections in the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231214>Deacylcynaropicrin Inhibits RANKL-Induced Osteoclastogenesis by Inhibiting NF-κB and MAPK and Promoting  Polarization of Macrophages.</a></h2><p> can promote the maturity of osteoclasts and bone resorption in many bone disease such as osteoporosis and arthritis. Here, we aimed to investigate the inhibitory effects of deacylcynaropicrin (DAC) on osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption induced by RANKL. Bone-marrow-derived macrophages were used for assessing the influence of DAC on polarization of macrophages and osteoclastogenesis . Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and CD206, as well as osteoclastogenesis markers, nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1 (NFATc1), and c-Fos, were qualitatively analyzed by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting. The results showed that DAC significantly inhibited osteoclastogenesis by suppressing the expression levels of c-Fos and NFATc1 through nuclear factor-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and Akt pathway. Moreover, immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed that DAC reduced the release of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 . Finally, DAC also promoted macrophage polarization from M1 to  types. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that DAC suppressed RANKL-induced  and osteoclastogenesis and therefore it can be used as a potential treatment for osteoporosis, arthritis, osteolysis, and aseptic loosening of artificial prostheses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351251>Regulation of the inflammatory response by vascular grafts modified with Aspirin-Triggered Resolvin D1 promotes blood vessel regeneration.</a></h2><p>The unabated inflammatory response is often the cause for inhibited vascular regeneration of transplanted small-diameter vascular grafts (diameter <6 mm) in vascular replacement therapies. We proposed that stimulating inflammatory resolution could be an effective approach for treatment of chronic vascular graft  after transplantation. Aspirin-Triggered Resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1) plays critical roles in driving cellular processes toward the resolution of  and suppressing downstream inflammatory signaling pathways. With the aim to facilitate vascular regeneration, we developed a polycaprolactone (PCL) vascular graft loaded with AT-RvD1. The results showed that AT-RvD1 promoted macrophage polarization into  macrophages in vitro. Macrophages pretreated with AT-RvD1 conditioned medium promoted endothelial cell tube formation. Furthermore, in vivo implantation was performed by replacing rat abdominal aorta. We observed fast endothelialization and enhanced smooth muscle regeneration in rats that received the AT-RvD1-containing graft implants. The presence of AT-RvD1 induced infiltration of a large number of  macrophages and integrin α4-positive (CD49d) neutrophils into the graft wall after implantation. Vascular graft RNA-Seq analysis revealed that AT-RvD1 inhibited leukocyte and neutrophil migration and activation. Results also indicated that macrophage polarization to the  phenotype was promoted on day 7 post-implantation. These results demonstrated the ability of locally delivered AT-RvD1 to increase pro-regenerative immune subpopulations and promote vascular tissue regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic  is a key deciding factor in the failure of vascular regeneration of transplanted small-diameter vascular grafts (diameter <6 mm). Aspirin-triggered Resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1) is a critical driving force in cellular resolution  and suppresses inflammatory signaling. Herein, we developed an electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) vascular graft loaded with AT-RvD1. In vivo implantation was performed by replacing rat abdominal aorta and AT-RvD1-loaded grafts showed rapid endothelialization, enhanced capillary formation, and excellent smooth muscle regeneration by regulating inflammatory reaction and promoting its rapid resolution. Thus, our study provided new perspectives for long-term vascular graft survival and integration with the host tissue. We believe that AT-RvD1 can be widely applied in tissue engineering owing to its anti-inflammatory and therapeutic effects.Copyright © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Whether ECM affects macrophage phenotype in obesity is uncertain. A better understanding of this relationship could be strategically important to reduce cancer risk or improve outcomes in the obese. Using clinical samples, computational approaches, and in vitro decellularized ECM models, this study quantified the relative abundance of pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory () macrophages in human breast adipose tissue, determined molecular similarities between obesity and tumor-associated macrophages, and assessed the regulatory effect of obese versus lean ECM on macrophage phenotype. Our results suggest that breast adipose tissue contains more - than M1-biased macrophages across all body mass index categories. Obesity further increased -biased macrophages but did not affect M1-biased macrophage density. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis suggested that breast tissue macrophages from obese versus lean women are more similar to tumor-associated macrophages. These changes positively correlated with adipose tissue interstitial fibrosis, and in vitro experiments indicated that obese ECM directly stimulates -biased macrophage functions. However, mammographic density cannot be used as a clinical indicator of these changes. Collectively, these data suggest that obesity-associated interstitial fibrosis promotes a macrophage phenotype similar to tumor-associated macrophages, which may contribute to the link between obesity and breast cancer.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Bone marrow monocyte-derived macrophages and resident-tissue macrophages infiltrate the vessel wall, after infiltration macrophages are polarized into various polarization phenotypes dominated by M1-like and -like cells. Polarized phenotypes of macrophages can regulate the formation and progression of intracranial aneurysms by releasing cytokines and regulating the inflammatory response of other immune cells, as well as release different cytokines to regulate the process of extracellular matrix remodeling. Some important progresses have been made in the clinical detection and treatment in targeting macrophages.

However, miRs circulate in extracellular vesicles (EVs) or in association with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or the RNA-binding protein Argonaute-2 (Ago-2). Given that the EV- and HDL- mediated miR transfer towards endothelial cells (ECs) regulates cellular quiescence and , we hypothesized that the distribution of miRs amongst carriers affects microvascular homeostasis in DN. Therefore, we determined the miR expression in EVs, HDL- and Ago-2 fractions isolated from EDTA-plasma of healthy controls, patients with diabetes mellitus +/- early DN (eGFR>30 ml/min/1.73 ) and DN patients (eGFR<30 ml/min/1.73 ). Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed alterations in miR-carrier distribution in plasma of DM and DN patients compared to healthy controls. Both miR-21 and miR-126 increased in EVs of DN patients, whereas miR-660 increased in the Ago-2 fraction and miR-132 decreased in the HDL fractions. Moreover, in vitro, differentially expressed miRs improved EC barrier formation (EV-miR-21) and rescued the angiogenic potential (HDL-miR-132) of ECs cultured in serum from DM and DN patients. In conclusion, miR measurement in EVs, HDL and Ago-2 may improve the biomarker sensitivity of these miRs for microvascular injury in DN while carrier-specific miRs can improve endothelial barrier formation (EV-miR-21/126) or exert a pro-angiogenic response (HDL-miR-132).© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31363142>Inhibition of the Akt1-mTORC1 Axis Alters Venous Remodeling to Improve Arteriovenous Fistula Patency.</a></h2><p>Arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) are the most common access created for hemodialysis, but up to 60% do not sustain dialysis within a year, suggesting a need to improve AVF maturation and patency. In a mouse AVF model, Akt1 regulates fistula wall thickness and diameter. We hypothesized that inhibition of the Akt1-mTORC1 axis alters venous remodeling to improve AVF patency. Daily intraperitoneal injections of rapamycin reduced AVF wall thickness with no change in diameter. Rapamycin decreased smooth muscle cell (SMC) and macrophage proliferation; rapamycin also reduced both M1 and  type macrophages. AVF in mice treated with rapamycin had reduced Akt1 and mTORC1 but not mTORC2 phosphorylation. Depletion of macrophages with clodronate-containing liposomes was also associated with reduced AVF wall thickness and both M1- and -type macrophages; however, AVF patency was reduced. Rapamycin was associated with improved long-term patency, enhanced early AVF remodeling and sustained reduction of SMC proliferation. These results suggest that rapamycin improves AVF patency by reducing early  and wall thickening while attenuating the Akt1-mTORC1 signaling pathway in SMC and macrophages. Macrophages are associated with AVF wall thickening and -type macrophages may play a mechanistic role in AVF maturation.

The polarization of macrophages in terms of M1 and  phenotypes is closely related to the production of inflammatory cytokines. Quercetin is traditionally recognized to have anti-inflammatory effect; however, whether quercetin modulates macrophage polarization from M1 to  and thus promotes diabetic wound healing remain unknown.Wounded male diabetic rats were equally divided into five groups: model group, solvent control group (10% DMSO), and three drug groups treated with quercetin (Q) at concentrations of 10 mg/mL (Q-LD [low dose]), 20 mg/mL (Q-MD [medium dose]), and 40 mg/mL (Q-HD [high dose]), respectively. The anti-inflammatory effect of quercetin on diabetic wounds was observed. Immunohistochemistry and quantificational real-time polymerase chain reaction were applied to test the changes in macrophage polarization and inflammatory responses.The wound contraction was fastest in Q-HD group. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's trichrome staining revealed that fibroblast distribution and collagen deposition in quercetin-treated groups were significantly higher than those in the model group. Immunohistochemistry tests showed more CD206-positive cells and less iNOS-positive cells in quercetin-treated groups. Furthermore, the levels of proinflammatory factors in quercetin-treated groups were lower than those in the model group, whereas the levels of the anti-inflammatory factors and angiogenesis-related factors were relatively higher.In short, quercetin inhibits inflammatory reactions via modulating macrophage polarization switching from M1 to  phenotype, thereby accelerating the diabetic wound repair.Copyright © 2019.

In particular, activation of PAR2 in cultured tubular epithelial cells induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase signalling and secretion of fibronectin, C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), suggesting a role in tubulointerstitial  and fibrosis. We tested this hypothesis in unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO) in which ongoing tubular epithelial cell damage drives tubulointerstitial  and fibrosis.Unilateral ureteric obstruction surgery was performed in groups (n = 9/10) of Par2-/- and wild type (WT) littermate mice which were killed 7 days later. Non-experimental mice were controls.Wild type mice exhibited a 5-fold increase in Par2 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the UUO kidney. In situ hybridization localized Par2 mRNA expression to tubular epithelial cells in normal kidney, with a marked increase in Par2 mRNA expression by tubular cells, including damaged tubular cells, in WT UUO kidney. Tubular damage (tubular dilation, increased KIM-1 and decreased α-Klotho expression) and tubular signalling (extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation) seen in WT UUO were not altered in Par2-/- UUO. In addition, macrophage infiltration, up-regulation of M1 (NOS2) and  (CD206) macrophage markers, and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory molecules (tumour necrosis factor, CCL2, interleukin-36α) in WT UUO kidney were unchanged in Par2-/- UUO. Finally, the accumulation of α-SMA+ myofibroblasts, deposition of collagen IV and expression of pro-fibrotic factors (CTGF, TGF-β1) were not different between WT and Par2-/- UUO mice.Protease-activated receptor 2 expression is substantially up-regulated in tubular epithelial cells in the obstructed kidney, but this does not contribute to the development of tubular damage, renal  or fibrosis.© 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484730>Monocyte/Macrophage Abnormalities Specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis Are Linked to miR-155 and Are Differentially Modulated by Different TNF Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Proinflammatory macrophages and miR-155 are increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We studied membrane TNF (mTNF) expression on blood monocytes, polarization into macrophages, miR-155 expression, and the effect of anti-TNF on these biomarkers in RA patients. Sixty-seven RA patients and 109 controls (55 healthy, 54 with spondyloarthritis and connective tissue diseases) were studied. Monocytes were isolated and differentiated into macrophages with or without anti-TNF. mTNF expression was increased on monocytes from RA patients, but not from other inflammatory diseases, correlated with disease activity. Under human serum AB or M-CSF, only monocytes from RA had a defect of differentiation into -like macrophages and had a propensity for preferential maturation toward M1-like macrophages that contributed to synovial . This defect was correlated to mTNF expression and was partially reversed by monoclonal anti-TNF Abs but not by the TNF soluble receptor. miR-155 was increased in -macrophages except in adalimumab-treated patients. Transfection of healthy monocytes with miR-155 induced a decrease in -like markers, and transfection of RA monocytes with antagomir-155 allowed restoration of -like polarization. Defect in differentiation of monocytes into -like-macrophages linked to increased miR-155 and correlated with increased mTNF on monocytes could play a key role in RA pathogenesis.

Most tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are  phenotype macrophages, which normally show anti-inflammatory functions in numerous disorders. Previously, we found that alternatively activated macrophages showed pro-inflammatory characteristics upon stimulation with hepatoma cell-derived debris; however, the molecular mechanism was unclear.In vitro and in vivo experiments were employed to investigate the molecular mechanism. Using pancreatic cancer cell lines, mouse models and human tissues, we obtained a general picture of tumour cell-derived debris promoting metastasis of pancreatic cancer by inducing  via TAMs.We showed that  macrophage-derived  also exists in PDAC. Debris from PDAC cells induced potent IL-1β release by  macrophages via TLR4/TRIF/NF-κB signalling, and this effect was further boosted by IgG that was also derived from PDAC cells. Increased IL-1β promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition and consequent metastasis of PDAC cells.

Earlier shift of inflammtory M1 macrophages to reparative  macrophages has demonstrated significant improvements in MI wound modeling and cardiac function. Here, we reported that TSLP could promote M1 to  macrophage polarization, and AngII skewed the macrophage phenotype towards  by inducing TSLP expression in vitro. Meanwhile, AngII could inhibit the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in macrophages, which are engaged in ECM degradation and cardiac remodeling. In post-MI mice, TSLP expression were up-regulated in cardiac tissue and serum, probably induced by renin-angiotensin system activation and AngII level up-regulation following MI. Our study mapped the continuum of changes that occured in cardiac macrophages over the first week of MI, and found that rTSLP treatment promoted earlier phenotype shift of M1 to  macrophages, improving cardiac healing and ventricular function recovery.

During neuroinflammation, microglia are activated, inducing the release of inflammatory or anti-inflammatory factors depending on their polarization into classical M1 microglia or alternative  phenotype. Therefore, optimizing brain microenvironment by small molecule-targeted microglia polarization and promoting neurite regeneration might be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. In this study, we found platycodigenin, a naturally occurring triterpenoid, promoted  polarization and inhibited M1 polarization in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 and primary microglia. Platycodigenin downregulated pro-inflammatory molecules such as interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6 and nitric oxide (NO), while upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Further investigation confirmed that platycodigenin inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2) positive M1 but increased Ym1/2 positive  microglial polarization in primary microglia. In addition, platycodigenin significantly decreased LPS-induced the hyperphosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 subunits. Furthermore, the inactivation of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) induced by LPS was completely ameliorated by platycodigenin.

However, little is known about the function of intestinal epithelial PKM2 in intestine homeostasis. Here we investigate whether and how intestinal epithelial PKM2 modulates the morphology and function of the adult intestine in experimental colitis. Analyzing colonoscopic biopsies from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients, we found significantly decreased level of intestinal epithelial PKM2 in patients compared to that in non-inflamed tissues. Similar reduction of intestinal epithelial PKM2 was observed in mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Moreover, intestinal epithelial-specific PKM2-knockout (Pkm2) mice displayed more severe intestinal , as evidenced by a shortened colon, disruption of epithelial tight junctions, an increase in inflammatory cytokine levels, and immune cell infiltration, when compared to wild-type mice. Gene profiling, western blot, and function analyses indicated that cell survival signals, particularly the Wnt/β-catenin pathways, were associated with PKM2 activity. Increasing mouse intestinal epithelial PKM2 expression via delivery of a PKM2-expressing plasmid attenuated experimental colitis. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that intestinal epithelial PKM2 increases cell survival and wound healing under the colitic condition via activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427677>An anti-inflammatory phenotype in visceral adipose tissue of old lean mice, augmented by exercise.</a></h2><p>Visceral adipose tissue is an immunogenic tissue, which turns detrimental during obesity by activation of proinflammatory macrophages. During aging, chronic  increases proportional to visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and associates with escalating morbidity and mortality. Here, we utilize a mouse model to investigate the inflammatory status of visceral adipose tissue in lean aging mice and assess the effects of exercise training interventions. We randomized adult (11 months; n = 21) and old (23 months; n = 27) mice to resistance training (RT) or endurance training (ET), or to a sedentary control group (S). Strikingly, we observed an anti-inflammatory phenotype in the old mice, consisting of higher accumulation of  macrophages and IL-10 expression, compared to the adult mice. In concordance, old mice also had less VAT mass and smaller adipocytes compared to adult mice. In both age groups, exercise training enhanced the anti-inflammatory phenotype and increased PGC1-α mRNA expression. Intriguingly, the brown adipose tissue marker UCP1 was modestly higher in old mice, while remained unchanged by the intervention. In conclusion, in the absence of obesity, visceral adipose tissue possesses a pronounced anti-inflammatory phenotype during aging which is further enhanced by exercise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582793>Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation exacerbates experimental colitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Detection of cytoplasmic DNA by the host's innate immune system is essential for microbial and endogenous pathogen recognition. In mammalian cells, an important sensor is the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein, which upon activation by bacterially-derived cyclic dinucleotides (cDNs) or cytosolic dsDNA (dsDNA), triggers type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Given the abundance of bacterially-derived cDNs in the gut, we determined whether STING deletion, or stimulation, acts to modulate the severity of intestinal  in the dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) model of colitis. DSS was administered to Tmem173 (STING-mutant) mice and to wild-type mice co-treated with DSS and a STING agonist. Colitis severity was markedly reduced in the DSS-treated Tmem173 mice and greatly exacerbated in wild-type mice co-treated with the STING agonist. STING expression levels were also assessed in colonic tissues, murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs), and human THP-1 cells. M1 and  polarized THP-1 and murine BMDMs were also stimulated with STING agonists and ligands to assess their responses. STING expression was increased in both murine and human M1 polarized macrophages and a STING agonist repolarized  macrophages towards an M1-like subtype. Our results suggest that STING is involved in the host's response to acutely-induced colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337415>Purple corn extract induces long-lasting reprogramming and  phenotypic switch of adipose tissue macrophages in obese mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a chronic and systemic inflammatory disorder and an important risk factor for the onset of several chronic syndromes. Adipose tissue (AT) plays a crucial role in the development of obesity, promoting the infiltration and accumulation of leukocytes in the tissue and sustaining adipocyte expansion. Anthocyanins exert a broad range of health benefits, but their effect in improving obesity-related  in vivo has been poorly characterized. We examined the effects of a purple corn cob extract in the context of AT  in a murine diet-induced obesity (DIO) model.Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to control diet (CTR + HO), high fat diet (HF + HO) or high fat diet plus purple corn extract (HF + RED) for 12 weeks. Blood glucose, AT, and liver gene expression, metabolism, biochemistry, and histology were analysed and flow cytometry was performed on AT leukocytes and Kupffer cells.RED extract intake resulted in lower MCP-1 mediated recruitment and proliferation of macrophages into crown-like structures in the AT. AT macrophages (ATM) of HF + RED group upregulated  markers (ArgI, Fizz1, TGFβ), downregulating inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, COX-2) thanks to the suppression of NF-kB signalling. ATM also increased the expression of iron metabolism-related genes (FABP4, Hmox1, Ferroportin, CD163, TfR1, Ceruloplasmin, FtL1, FtH1) associated with a reduction in iron storage and increased turnover. ATM from HF + RED mice did not respond to LPS treatment ex vivo, confirming the long-lasting effects of the treatment on  polarization. Adipocytes of HF + RED group improved lipid metabolism and displayed a lower  grade. Liver histology revealed a remarkable reduction of steatosis in the HF + RED group, and Kupffer cell profiling displayed a marked switch towards the  phenotype.RED extract attenuated AT  in vivo, with a long-lasting reprogramming of ATM and adipocyte profiles towards the anti-inflammatory phenotype, therefore representing a valuable supplement in the context of obesity-associated disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31318033>Moderate Postmeal Walking Has No Beneficial Effects Over Resting on Postprandial Lipemia, Glycemia, Insulinemia, and Selected Oxidative and Inflammatory Parameters in Older Adults with a Cardiovascular Disease Risk Phenotype: A Randomized Crossover Trial.</a></h2><p>Research suggests that postprandial events, as risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), are influenced by meal composition and exercise.We investigated the effect of walking versus rest on postprandial metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative events following the consumption of test meals reflecting 2 different dietary patterns in older adults with an increased CVD risk.A randomized crossover trial was conducted in 26 men and women (aged 70 ± 5 y; BMI 30.3 ± 2.3 kg/). Each adult participated in 4 treatments combining 1 of 2 iso-energetic (4300 kJ) meals [Western diet high-fat meal (WD): total fat, 59.4 g; saturated fatty acids, 32.0 g, dietary fiber, 4.2 g; or Mediterranean-type diet meal (MD): total fat, 40.1 g; saturated fatty acids, 5.1 g; dietary fiber, 14.5 g] with 30 min walking (4.6 ± 0.1 km/h) or rest.

Beyond that, IRF4 exerts important functions in controlling the cytokine milieu, T-cell differentiation, and macrophage polarization. The latter has been implicated in tissue remodeling. It therefore remains elusive what the role of IRF4 is in terms of long-term outcome following IRI. We hypothesized that an inability to resolve chronic  in   mice would promote chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. To evaluate the effects of IRF4 in chronic upon acute injury , a mouse model of chronic injury following acute IRI was employed. The expression of Irf4 increased within 10 days after IRI in renal tissue. Both mRNA and protein levels remained high up to 5 weeks upon IRI, suggesting a regulatory function in the chronic phase. Mice deficient in IRF4 display increased tubular cell loss and defective clearance of infiltrating macrophages. These phenomena were associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory macrophage markers together with reduced expression of alternatively activated macrophage markers. In addition, IRF4-deficient mice showed defective development of alternatively activated macrophages. Hints of a residual M1 macrophage signature were further observed in human biopsy specimens of patients with hypertensive nephropathy vs. living donor specimens. Thus, IRF4 restricts CKD progression and kidney fibrosis following IRI, potentially by enabling  macrophage polarization and restricting a Th1 cytokine response. Deteriorated alternative macrophage subpopulations in   mice provoke chronic intrarenal , tubular epithelial cell loss, and renal fibrosis in the long course after IRI in mice. The clinical significance of these finding for human CKD remains uncertain at present and warrants further studies.Copyright © 2019 Lorenz, Moschovaki-Filippidou, Würf, Metzger, Steiger, Batz, Carbajo-Lozoya, Koziel, Schnurr, Cohen, Schmaderer, Anders, Lindenmeyer and Lech.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408279>MFG-E8 regulates  and apoptosis in tendon healing, and promotes tendon repair: A histological and biochemical evaluation.</a></h2><p>Several studies have identified potential roles for MFG-E8 in promoting tissue repair. However, the effects of MFG-E8 on tendon repair have not yet been investigated. Therefore, we explored the role of MFG-E8 on tendon repair using a rat model of patellar tendon injury. The patellar tendons of Sprague Dawley rats (n = 24/group) received window defects and, after modeling, three groups were randomly assigned: (a) recombinant MFG-E8 (rMFG-E8) group, implantation with MFG-E8 and fibrin glue (400 ng in 10 μl); (b) fibrin group, implantation with fibrin only; and (c) control group, without any treatment. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression analyses were performed at 2 and 4 weeks after healing. Administration of rMFG-E8 in injury sites significantly improved tendon healing histologically at 4 weeks after injury. In addition, numbers of M1 macrophages and M1-stimulator genes, including IFNG, Il-1B, and Il-6, were reduced in the repair sites at 2 weeks by rMFG-E8 administration. In parallel, rMFG-E8 significantly increased the number of  macrophages and expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and IL-4 at 2 weeks after injury. Treatment with rMFG-E8 markedly decreased tendon cell apoptosis. Moreover, rMFG-E8 significantly enhanced the expression of genes related to tendon matrix formation at 2 weeks after injury, including Col1a1and tenascin-C. We conclude that MFG-E8 could regulate inflammatory responses and apoptotic cell accumulation in tendon repair, and promote the healing process of injured tendon tissue. Thus, exogenous application of MFG-E8 might have therapeutic potential for repair of tendon injuries.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504709>Whole Grain Wheat Consumption Affects Postprandial Inflammatory Response in a Randomized Controlled Trial in Overweight and Obese Adults with Mild Hypercholesterolemia in the Graandioos Study.</a></h2><p>Whole grain wheat (WGW) consumption is associated with health benefits in observational studies. However, WGW randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies show mixed effects.The health impact of WGW consumption was investigated by quantification of the body's resilience, which was defined as the "ability to adapt to a standardized challenge."A double-blind RCT was performed with overweight and obese (BMI: 25-35 kg/) men (n = 19) and postmenopausal women (n = 31) aged 45-70 y, with mildly elevated plasma total cholesterol (>5 mmol/L), who were randomly assigned to either 12-wk WGW (98 g/d) or refined wheat (RW). Before and after the intervention a standardized mixed-meal challenge was performed. Plasma samples were taken after overnight fasting and postprandially (30, 60, 120, and 240 min). Thirty-one biomarkers were quantified focusing on metabolism, liver, cardiovascular health, and . Linear mixed-models evaluated fasting compared with postprandial intervention effects. Health space models were used to evaluate intervention effects as composite markers representing resilience of , liver, and metabolism.Postprandial biomarker changes related to liver showed decreased alanine aminotransferase by WGW (P = 0.03) and increased β-hydroxybutyrate (P = 0.001) response in RW.

Macrophages are key players in the induction, propagation and resolution of , actively contributing to the pathogenesis and resolution of inflammatory disorders. As such, this study aimed to investigate the possible therapeutic effects bovine casein derived nutraceuticals exert on macrophage immunological function. Initial studies demonstrated that sodium caseinate induced a -like macrophage phenotype that was attributed to the kappa-casein subunit. Kappa-casein primed macrophages acquired a -like phenotype that expressed CD206, CD54, OX40L, CD40 on the cell surface and gene expression of Arg-1, RELM-α and YM1, archetypical  markers. Macrophages stimulated with kappa-casein secreted significantly reduced TNF-α and IL-10 in response to TLR stimulation through a mechanism that targeted the nuclear factor-κB signal transduction pathway. Macrophage proteolytic processing of kappa-casein was required to elicit these suppressive effects, indicating that a fragment other than C-terminal fragment, glycomacropeptide, induced these modulatory effects. Kappa-casein treated macrophages also impaired T-cell responses. Given the powerful immuno-modulatory effects exhibited by kappa-casein and our understanding of immunopathology associated with inflammatory diseases, this fragment has the potential as an oral nutraceutical and therefore warrants further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31227407>Histological analysis of infiltrating macrophages in the cerebral aneurysm walls.</a></h2><p>A series of recent evidences suggested activated macrophages have broadly two distinct forms that possess opposite functions for the process of : classically activated macrophages (M1/kill macrophages) and alternatively activated macrophages (/repair macrophages) according to their functions and expression markers. To elucidate what roles those two phenotypes of macrophages play in the evolution of cerebral aneurysm, the presence of macrophages inside the aneurysm walls was assessed with an immunohistochemical approach. The portions of the aneurysm domes deflated after neck clipping were utilized for the further histological examinations, including immunostainings with five antibodies to identify macrophage subpopulations. In this study, contrary to the previous reports, the following various ratios of subtypes were observed in the aneurysm walls: M1 >  (2 cases), M1 <  (2 cases), M1 =  (3 cases). While M1-like macrophages have been typically regarded as a main driver of the degenerating process, these surprisingly richer presences of -like macrophages in the aneurysm walls suggests that an unrecognized biological process might be in play in aneurysm development.Copyright © 2019.

The involvement of the anti-inflammatory effects of HDACi in their neuroprotection has been reported, but the underlying mechanisms are still uncertain. Given the post-stroke  is a time-dependent process, starting with acute and intense , and followed by a prolonged and mild one, we proposed whether target the early inflammatory response could achieve the neuroprotection of HDACi? To test this hypothesis, a single dose of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (50 mg/kg), a pan HDACi, was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected immediately or 12 h after ischemia onset in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse model. Compared with delayed injection, immediate SAHA treatment provided more protection, evidenced by smaller infarction volume, and a better outcome. This protection was accompanied by suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduction of activated microglia in the early stage of post-stroke . Moreover, SAHA treatment suppressed M1 cytokine expression (IL-6, TNF-α, and iNOS) while promoted the transcription of  cytokines (Arg-1 and IL-10) in LPS-challenged mouse microglia, and enhanced CD206 ( marker) but decreased CD86 (M1 markers) levels in microglia isolated from the ipsilateral hemisphere of MCAO mice. Collectively, our data suggested that the protection of SAHA on ischemic brain injury was closely associated with its inhibition on the early inflammatory response, and this inhibition was related to its reducing microglia activation and priming the activated microglia toward a more protective phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31439648>Role of CCR2 in the Development of Streptozotocin-Treated Diabetic Cardiomyopathy.</a></h2><p>CCR2 has been proven to play an important role in diabetes.

We created a model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy. Expression of CCR2 was upregulated in the hearts of STZ-induced diabetic mice. CCR2 knockout significantly improved STZ-induced cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis. Moreover, deletion of CCR2 inhibited STZ-induced apoptosis and the production of STZ-induced reactive oxygen species in the heart. CCR2 knockout resulted in  polarization in hearts of STZ-treated mice. Treatment with a CCR2 inhibitor reversed hyperglycemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in  mice.

One putative target of pelargonidins is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). A synthetic pelargonidin (Mt-P) was synthesized by the methylation of the pelargonidin (the natural compound indicated as P). Mt-P transactivated the AhR with an EC of 1.97 µM and was ~2-fold more potent than the natural compound. In vitro Mt-P attenuated pro-inflammatory activities of Raw264.7 macrophage cells in an AhR-dependent manner.

A dose of 5 mg/kg Mt-P, but not the natural compound P, reversed intestinal  and increased expression of Tnf-α, Ifn-ƴ, and Il-6, while promoted the expansion of regulatory T cells and  macrophages. In C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat diet (HFD), Mt-P attenuated body weight gain, intestinal and liver , and ameliorated insulin sensitivity, while worsened liver steatosis by up-regulating the liver expression of Cd36 and Apo100b.

Upregulation of miR-223 microRNAs (miRNAs) shows driving of the polarization of macrophages toward the anti-inflammatory () phenotype, which could aid in the acceleration of wound healing. However, local-targeted delivery of microRNAs is still challenging, due to their low stability. Here, adhesive hydrogels containing miR-223 5p mimic (miR-223*) loaded hyaluronic acid nanoparticles are developed to control tissue macrophages polarization during wound healing processes. In vitro upregulation of miR-223* in J774A.1 macrophages demonstrates increased expression of the anti-inflammatory gene Arg-1 and a decrease in proinflammatory markers, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. The therapeutic potential of miR-223* loaded adhesive hydrogels is also evaluated in vivo. The adhesive hydrogels could adhere to and cover the wounds during the healing process in an acute excisional wound model. Histological evaluation and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis show that local delivery of miR-223* efficiently promotes the formation of uniform vascularized skin at the wound site, which is mainly due to the polarization of macrophages to the  phenotype.

In its metabolic role, pyruvate kinase  catalyzes the last glycolytic step which converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate with the generation of ATP. Beyond this metabolic role in glycolysis, PKM2 regulates gene expression in the nucleus, phosphorylates several essential proteins that regulate major cell signaling pathways, and contribute to the redox homeostasis of cancer cells. The expression of PKM2 has been demonstrated to be significantly elevated in several types of cancer, and the overall inflammatory response. The unusual pattern of PKM2 expression inspired scientists to investigate the unrevealed functions of PKM2 and the therapeutic potential of targeting PKM2 in cancer and other disorders. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to discuss the mechanistic and therapeutic potential of targeting PKM2 with the focus on cancer metabolism, redox homeostasis, , and metabolic disorders.

BA5 treatment decreased  and fibrosis in heart sections but did not improve exercise capacity or ameliorate cardiac electric disturbances in infected mice. Serum concentrations of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-1β, as well as cardiac gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, were reduced after BA5 treatment. In contrast, a significant increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 concentration was observed in BA5-treated mice in both tested doses compared to vehicle-treated mice. Moreover, polarization to anti-inflammatory/ macrophage phenotype was evidenced by a decrease in the expression of NOS2 and proinflammatory cytokines and the increase in  markers, such as Arg1 and CHI3 in mice treated with BA5. In conclusion, BA5 had a potent anti-inflammatory activity on a model of parasite-driven heart disease related to IL-10 production and a switch from M1 to  subset of macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557396>Exosomes derived from pro-inflammatory bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells reduce  and myocardial injury via mediating macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Exosomes are served as substitutes for stem cell therapy, playing important roles in mediating heart repair during myocardial infarction injury. Evidence have indicated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pre-conditioning bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and their secreted exosomes promote macrophage polarization and tissue repair in several  diseases; however, it has not been fully elucidated in myocardial infarction (MI). This study aimed to investigate whether LPS-primed BMSC-derived exosomes could mediate  and myocardial injury via macrophage polarization after MI. Here, we found that exosomes derived from BMSCs, in both Exo and L-Exo groups, increased  macrophage polarization and decreased M1 macrophage polarization under LPS stimulation, which strongly depressed LPS-dependent NF-κB signalling pathway and partly activated the AKT1/AKT2 signalling pathway. Compared with Exo, L-Exo had superior therapeutic effects on polarizing  macrophage in vitro and attenuated the post-infarction  and cardiomyocyte apoptosis by mediating macrophage polarization in mice MI model. Consequently, we have confidence in the perspective that low concentration of LPS pre-conditioning BMSC-derived exosomes may develop into a promising cell-free treatment strategy for clinical treatment of MI.© 2019 The Authors.

We and others have previously reported -TAM infiltration in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).To determine whether the extent of -TAM infiltration correlates with PC aggressiveness.Normal prostate tissue, localized PC, and mCRPC samples from 192 patients were retrospectively analyzed.We analytically validated an immunohistochemistry assay for detection of the human mannose receptor (CD206) to assess  macrophage involvement.Multiplex immunofluorescent staining showed that a small fraction of CD206 staining co-localized with the endothelial cells of lymphatic vessels, while the vast majority of staining occurred in CD68-positive macrophages. The area fraction of staining for CD206-positive macrophages increased in a stepwise fashion from normal (ie, no ) prostate tissue, to primary untreated carcinomas, to hormone-naïve regional lymph node metastases, to mCRPC. Complementary studies using flow cytometry confirmed CD206-positive -TAM infiltration. Limitations include the small number of rapid autopsy samples and the lack of neuroendocrine PC samples.Our results revealed a progressive increase in CD206-positive macrophages from normal prostate to mCRPC. Given the immunosuppressive nature of macrophages and the lack of clinical success of immunotherapy for PC patients, our results provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of macrophages in the PC microenvironment as a potential method to augment immunotherapeutic responses.In this report we used 192 prostate cancer samples to determine if  macrophage infiltration is correlated with castration resistance in prostate cancer.Copyright © 2018.

We have assessed the therapeutic effects of digoxin to reduce nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by the clinically relevant oral route in mice and analyzed the cellular basis for this effect with differential involvement of liver cell subsets. C57BL/6J male mice were placed on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 wk and started concurrently with the gavage of digoxin (2.5, 0.5, 0.125 mg/kg twice a week) for 5 wk. Digoxin significantly reduced HFD-induced hepatic damage, steatosis, and liver  across a wide dosage range. The lowest dose of digoxin (0.125 mg/kg) showed significant protective effects against liver injury and sterile . Consistently, digoxin attenuated HIF-1α sustained NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. We have reported for the first time that PKM2 is upregulated in hepatocytes with hepatic steatosis, and digoxin directly improved hepatocyte mitochondrial dysfunction and steatosis. Mechanistically, digoxin directly bound to PKM2 and inhibited PKM2 targeting HIF-1α transactivation without affecting PKM2 enzyme activation. Thus, oral digoxin showed potential to therapeutically inhibit liver injury in NASH through the regulation of PKM2-HIF-1α pathway activation with involvement of multiple cell types. Because of the large clinical experience with oral digoxin, this may have significant clinical applicability in human NASH. This study is the first to assess the therapeutic efficacy of oral digoxin on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in a high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model and to determine the divergent of cell type-specific effects. Oral digoxin reduced liver damage, steatosis, and  in HFD mice. Digoxin attenuated hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α axis-sustained inflammasome activity in macrophages and hepatic oxidative stress response in hepatocytes via the regulation of PKM2-HIF-1α axis pathway activation. Oral digoxin may have significant clinical applicability in human NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632398>Compromised Anti-inflammatory Action of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in PAD4-Deficient Mice Contributes to Aggravated Acute  After Myocardial Infarction.</a></h2><p>Innate immune responses and rapid recruitment of leukocytes, which regulate  and subsequent healing, play a key role in acute myocardial infarction (MI). Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is critically involved in chromatin decondensation during the release of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) by activated neutrophils. Alternatively, activated macrophages () and accurate collagen deposition determine the repair of the infarcted heart. In this study, we investigated the impact of NETs on macrophage polarization and their role for acute cardiac  and subsequent cardiac healing in a mouse model of acute MI. NETs were found to promote  macrophage polarization toward a reparative phenotype. NETs suppressed pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) under hypoxia and diminished IL-6 and TNF-α expression. Further on, NETs strongly supported M2b polarization and IL-10 expression. In cardiac fibroblasts, NETs increased  expression under hypoxic culture conditions. PAD4 mice subjected to permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery suffered from overwhelming  in the acute phase of MI. Noteworthy, PAD4 neutrophils were unable to release NETs upon  stimulation with ionomycin or PMA, but produced significantly higher amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased levels of circulating cell-free DNA, mitochondrial DNA and cardiac troponin were found in PAD4 mice in the acute phase of MI when compared to WT mice. Reduced cardiac expression of , and  marker genes, as well as increased α expression, suggested a pro-inflammatory state. PAD4 mice displayed significantly increased cardiac  expression under baseline conditions. At day 1, post-MI, PAD4 mice showed increased end-diastolic volume and increased thinning of the left ventricular wall. Interestingly, improved cardiac function, as demonstrated by significantly increased ejection fraction, was found at day 21. Altogether, our results indicate that NETs support macrophage polarization toward an  phenotype, thus displaying anti-inflammatory properties. PAD4 deficiency aggravates acute  and increases tissue damage post-MI, partially due to the lack of NETs.Copyright © 2019 Eghbalzadeh, Georgi, Louis, Zhao, Keser, Weber, Mollenhauer, Conforti, Wahlers and Paunel-Görgülü.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286423>A case of primary biliary cholangitis overlapping with type 2 autoimmune hepatitis.</a></h2><p>A 42-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with cholestatic liver injury. Serological examination revealed anti-mitochondrial  antibody positivity and anti-nuclear antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody negativity. Histological examination of the first liver biopsy revealed chronic nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis with epithelioid granulomas. Ursodeoxycholic acid therapy successfully treated her cholestasis. Sixteen months later, she developed acute icteric hepatitis with elevation of serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels. Anti-mitochondrial  positivity and anti-nuclear antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody negativity persisted at that time. However, it became clear that anti-liver kidney microsomal type 1 antibody was positive. Histological examination of the second liver biopsy demonstrated scarce interface hepatitis and evident parenchymal  and centrilobular zonal necrosis. Her liver biochemical test results promptly improved with the addition of prednisolone therapy. Considering the findings, she was diagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis-type 2 autoimmune hepatitis overlap syndrome.

A proper switch from proinflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory  dominant Mϕs accelerates the wound healing processes leading to favorable wound-care outcomes. Herein, an exosome-guided cell reprogramming technique is proposed to directly convert M1 to  Mϕs for effective wound management. The  Mϕ-derived exosomes (-Exo) induce a complete conversion of M1 to  Mϕs in vitro. The reprogrammed  Mϕs turn Arginase (-marker) and iNOS (M1-marker) on and off, respectively, and exhibit distinct phenotypic and functional features of  Mϕs. -Exo has not only Mϕ reprogramming factors but also various cytokines and growth factors promoting wound repair. After subcutaneous administration of -Exo into the wound edge, the local populations of M1 and  Mϕs are markedly decreased and increased, respectively, showing a successful exosome-guided switch to  Mϕ polarization. The direct conversion of M1 to  Mϕs at the wound site accelerates wound healing by enhancing angiogenesis, re-epithelialization, and collagen deposition. The Mϕ phenotype switching induced by exosomes possessing the excellent cell reprogramming capability and innate biocompatibility can be a promising therapeutic approach for various -associated disorders by regulating the balance between pro- versus anti-inflammatory Mϕs.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, using self-limited  peritonitis in mice, we identified endogenous maresin (MaR) CTR (MCTR), protectin (PD) CTR (PCTR), and resolvin CTR in infectious peritoneal exudates and distal spleens, as well as investigated enzymes involved in their biosynthesis. PCTRs were identified to be temporally regulated in peritoneal exudates and spleens. PCTR1 and MCTR1 were each produced by human recombinant leukotriene (LT) C synthase (LTCS) and glutathione -transferases (GSTs) [microsomal GST (mGST)2, mGST3, and GST-μ (GSTM)4] from their epoxide precursors [16,17-epoxy-PD (ePD) and 13,14-epoxy-MaR (eMaR)], with preference for GSTM4. Both eMaR and ePD inhibited LTB production by LTA hydrolase. LTCS, mGST2, mGST3, and GSTM4 were each expressed in human M1- and -like macrophages where LTCS inhibition increased CTRs. Finally, PCTR1 showed potent analgesic action. These results demonstrate CTR biosynthesis in mouse peritonitis, human spleens, and human macrophages, as well as identification of key enzymes in these pathways. Moreover, targeting LTCS increases CTR metabolomes, giving a new strategy to stimulate resolution and tissue regeneration.-Jouvene, C. C., Shay, A. E., Soens, M. A., Norris, P. C., Haeggström, J.

In this study, we compared the effects of LGAL vs. SG on obesity-induced adipose tissue macrophage infiltration and  in diet-induced obese rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks to induce obesity. SG, GLAL, or corresponding sham surgeries were performed in anesthetized rats. Inflammatory factor expression in serum and epididymal and retroperitoneal adipose tissues were analyzed 4 weeks after surgery. Macrophage infiltration and phenotype transformation were also assessed with Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. RESULTS Both LGAL and SG strongly attenuated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced fat accumulation in retroperitoneal and epididymal tissues. The expressions of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 were downregulated after LGAL and after SG by promoting activation of  macrophages, despite continued exposure to HFD. Furthermore, both LGAL and SG resulted in increased macrophage infiltration, but did not contribute to phenotype transformation of macrophages to M1. CONCLUSIONS LGAL and SG both reduced fat accumulation caused by HFD feeding. Therapies designed to ameliorate the inflammatory response by promoting activation of  macrophages may be valuable.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408874>Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure of One Eye Stimulates Sympathizing Expression of Neurokinin-1 Receptor but Not Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 in the Partner Eye.</a></h2><p>To investigate the influence of unilateral ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure on the unexposed, partner eye in vivo.

We have designed this study to compare the effects of weight reduction on histological activity and fibrosis of lean and non-lean NASH.We have included 20 lean and 20 non-lean histologically proven NASH patients. BMI < 25 kg/ was defined as non-lean. Informed consent was taken from each subject. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moderate exercise along with dietary restriction was advised for both groups for weight reduction. After 1 year, 16 non-lean and 15 lean had completed second liver biopsy.Age, sex, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltrasferase (GGT), Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was similar in both groups. Steatosis, ballooning, lobular , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis was similar in the two groups. In lean/non-lean group, any amount of weight reduction, ≥ 5% weight reduction and ≥ 7% weight reduction was found in respectively 8/11, 5/6 and 2/6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular  and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ 5% was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean NASH.© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.

The excessive activation of the host's immune system at early stages contributes to multiple organ damage. Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP1) exerts an important effect on the inflammatory process. In our recent bioinformatic analysis, we confirmed that the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) significantly promoted the expression of MKP1 in murine macrophages. However, the underlying mechanism and its effect on macrophage polarization remain unclear. In this study, we show that the suppression of PTP1B induced upregulation of MKP1 in M1 macrophages. A RayBiotech mouse  antibody assay further revealed that MKP1-knockdown promoted pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL12p70, IL-17, IL-21, IL-23, and TNF-α) secretion but suppressed anti-proinflammatory cytokine (IL-10) production in  macrophages. Phospho-proteomics analysis further identified ERK1/2 and p38 as downstream molecules of MKP1. Moreover, we found that the inhibition of PTP1B lowered the expression of miR-26a, showing a negative correlation with MKP1 protein expression. Thus, we concluded that the inhibition of PTP1B contributes to  macrophage polarization via reducing mir-26a and afterwards enhancing MKP1 expression in murine macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649305>Macrophages reprogrammed by lung cancer microparticles promote tumor development via release of IL-1β.</a></h2><p>Despite their mutual antagonism,  and immunosuppression coexist in tumor microenvironments due to tumor and immune cell interactions, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Previously, we showed that tumor cell-derived microparticles induce an  phenotype characterized by immunosuppression in tumor-infiltrating macrophages. Here, we further showed that lung cancer microparticles (L-MPs) induce macrophages to release a key proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1β, thus promoting lung cancer development. The underlying mechanism involves the activation of TLR3 and the NLRP3 inflammasome by L-MPs. More importantly, tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment-induced L-MPs also induce human macrophages to release IL-1β, leading to a tumor-promoting effect in a humanized mouse model. These findings demonstrated that in addition to their anti-inflammatory effect, L-MPs induce a proinflammatory phenotype in tumor-infiltrating macrophages, promoting the development of inflammatory and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339777>Knockout of TRPA1 exacerbates angiotensin II-induced kidney injury.</a></h2><p>Macrophage-mediated  plays a critical role in hypertensive kidney disease. Here, we investigated the role of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a sensor of , in angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced renal injury. Subcutaneous infusion of ANG II (600 ng·min·kg) for 28 days was used to induce hypertension and renal injury in mice. The results showed that ANG II-induced hypertensive mice have decreased renal Trpa1 expression ( < 0.01), whereas ANG II receptor type 1a-deficient hypotensive mice have increased renal Trpa1 expression ( < 0.05) compared with their normotensive counterparts. ANG II induced similar elevations of systolic blood pressure in  and wild-type (WT) mice but led to higher levels of blood urea nitrogen ( < 0.05), serum creatinine ( < 0.05), and renal fibrosis ( < 0.01) in  mice than WT mice. Similarly, ANG II increased both CD68/inducible nitric oxide synthase M1 and CD68/arginase 1  macrophages in the kidneys of both  and WT mice (all  < 0.01), with higher extents in  mice (both  < 0.01). Compared with WT mice,  mice had significantly increased expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and their receptors in the kidney. Cultured murine macrophages were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which downregulated gene expression of TRPA1 ( < 0.01). A TRPA1 agonist, cinnamaldehyde, significantly inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated expression of IL-1β and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 in macrophages, which were attenuated by pretreatment with a TRPA1 antagonist, HC030031. Furthermore, activation of TRPA1 with cinnamaldehyde induced apoptosis of macrophages.
