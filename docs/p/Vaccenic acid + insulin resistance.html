However, previous epidemiological studies on the association between TFAs, based primarily on self-reported intake from the diet, and diabetes in humans have yielded conflicting results. Herein we examined the associations of objectively measured plasma TFA concentrations with diabetes in a large population-based study among US adults.We included 3801 participants aged ≥20 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000 and 2009-10. Four major TFAs, namely palmitelaidic acid (C16:1 n-7t), elaidic acid (C18:1 n-9t),  (C18:1 n-7t), and linolelaidic acid (C18:2 n-6t, 9t), were measured in fasting plasma using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Diabetes was defined by self-reported physician diagnosis, plasma fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, or HbA1c ≥6.5%.After adjustment for other major risk factors, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of diabetes comparing the highest with lowest quintile of plasma TFAs was 2.19 (1.27-3.79) for total TFAs (P  = 0.01), 2.34 (1.48-3.72) for elaidic acid (P  = 0.0004), 1.33 (0.82-2.15) for linolelaidic acid (P  = 0.18), 1.58 (0.97-2.58) for palmitelaidic acid (P  = 0.02), and 1.64 (0.95-2.84) for  (P  = 0.08). In addition, total TFAs, elaidic acid, palmitelaidic acid, and  were significantly associated with fasting glucose, fasting insulin, the insulin resistance index, and HbA1c.In a nationally representative population, plasma TFAs, in particular elaidic acid, were positively associated with diabetes and biomarkers of glucose metabolism.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20065507>Prominent role of liver in elevated plasma palmitoleate levels in response to rosiglitazone in mice fed high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>In humans, antidiabetics thiazolidinediones (TZDs) upregulate stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) gene in adipose tissue and increase plasma levels of SCD1 product palmitoleate, known to enhance muscle  sensitivity. Involvement of other tissues in the beneficial effects of TZDs on plasma lipid profile is unclear. In our previous study in mice, in which lipogenesis was suppressed by corn oil-based high-fat (cHF) diet, TZD rosiglitazone induced hepatic Scd1 expression, while liver triacylglycerol content increased, VLDL-triacylglycerol production decreased and plasma lipid profile and whole-body glycemic control improved. Aim of this study was to characterise contribution of liver to changes of plasma lipid profile in response to a 8-week-treatment by rosiglitazone in the cHF diet-fed mice. Rosiglitazone (10 mg/kg diet) upregulated expression of Scd1 in various tissues, with a stronger effect in liver as compared with adipose tissue or skeletal muscle. Rosiglitazone increased content of monounsaturated fatty acids in liver, adipose tissue and plasma, with palmitoleate being the most up-regulated fatty acid. In the liver, enhancement of SCD1 activity and specific enrichment of cholesteryl esters and phosphatidyl cholines with palmitoleate and vaccenate was found, while strong correlations between changes of various liver lipid fractions and total plasma lipids were observed (r=0.74-0.88). -stimulated glycogen synthesis was increased by rosiglitazone, with a stronger effect in muscle than in liver.changes in plasma lipid profile favouring monounsaturated fatty acids, mainly palmitoleate, due to the upregulation of Scd1 and enhancement of SCD1 activity in the liver, could be involved in the -sensitizing effects of TZDs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24775093>Diets enriched in trans-11  alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation in a rat model of NAFLD and metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Trans11-18:1 (, VA) is one of the most predominant naturally occurring trans fats in our food chain and has recently been shown to exert hypolipidemic effects in animal models. In this study, we reveal new mechanism(s) by which VA can alter body fat distribution, energy utilization and dysfunctional lipid metabolism in an animal model of obesity displaying features of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Obese JCR:LA-cp rats were assigned to a control diet that included dairy-derived fat or the control diet supplemented with 1% VA. VA reduced total body fat (-6%), stimulated adipose tissue redistribution [reduced mesenteric fat (-17%) while increasing inguinal fat mass (29%)] and decreased adipocyte size (-44%) versus control rats. VA supplementation also increased metabolic rate (7%) concomitantly with an increased preference for whole-body glucose utilization for oxidation and increased insulin sensitivity [lower HOMA-IR (-59%)]. Further, VA decreased nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity scores (-34%) and reduced hepatic (-27%) and intestinal (-39%) triglyceride secretion relative to control diet, while exerting differential transcriptional regulation of SREBP1 and FAS amongst other key genes in the liver and the intestine. Adding VA to dairy fat alleviates features of MetS potentially by remodeling adipose tissue and attenuating ectopic lipid accumulation in a rat model of obesity and MetS. Increasing VA content in the diet (naturally or by fortification) may be a useful approach to maximize the health value of dairy-derived fats.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This work demonstrates long-term metabolic effects of the NND as compared with an Average Danish Diet (ADD) in blood plasma and reveals associations between metabolic changes and health beneficial effects of the NND including weight loss. A total of 145 individuals completed the intervention and blood samples were taken along with clinical examinations before the intervention started (week 0) and after 12 and 26 weeks. The plasma metabolome was measured using GC-MS, and the final metabolite table contained 144 variables. Significant and novel metabolic effects of the diet, resulting weight loss, gender, and intervention study season were revealed using PLS-DA and ASCA. Several metabolites reflecting specific differences in the diets, especially intake of plant foods and seafood, and in energy metabolism related to ketone bodies and gluconeogenesis formed the predominant metabolite pattern discriminating the intervention groups. Among NND subjects, higher levels of  and 3-hydroxybutanoic acid were related to a higher weight loss, while higher concentrations of salicylic, lactic, and N-aspartic acids and 1,5-anhydro-d-sorbitol were related to a lower weight loss. Specific gender and seasonal differences were also observed. The study strongly indicates that healthy diets high in fish, vegetables, fruit, and whole grain facilitated weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity by increasing ketosis and gluconeogenesis in the fasting state.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25860656>Serum metabolomics study of polycystic ovary syndrome based on UPLC-QTOF-MS coupled with a pattern recognition approach.</a></h2><p>Metabolomics has become an important tool in distinguishing changes in metabolic pathways and the diagnosis of human disease. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a relatively complicated, heterogeneous endocrine disorder. The etiology and pathogenesis of PCOS remain uncertain. In this study, based on the platform of ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) and the method of pattern recognition, a comprehensive metabolomics approach has been applied to explore the changes in metabolic profiling between PCOS patients (n = 20) and controls (n = 15) as well as insulin-resistance (IR) PCOS patients (n = 11) and non-IR PCOS subjects (n = 9) in serum. In total, 36 metabolites were found significantly different between PCOS and controls, and 9 metabolites were discovered significantly different between IR and non-IR PCOS patients. Significant increases in the levels of saturated and unsaturated  acids (myristic acid, linoleic acid, 9-/13-HODE, etc.),  amides (palmitic amide, oleamide), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, L-glutamic acid, azelaic acid, L-glyceric acid, pyroglutamic acid, and decreases in the levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine, uridine, and L-carnitine were found in PCOS patients compared with controls. In IR PCOS patients, linoleic acid, myristic acid, palmitoleic acid, and  also increased significantly compared with non-IR PCOS patients. All these changed metabolites showed abnormalities of steroid hormone biosynthesis, amino acids and nucleosides metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and lipids and carbohydrates metabolism in PCOS patients. The subgroup IR PCOS patients exhibited greater metabolic deviations than non-IR PCOS patients. These findings may help yield promising insights into the pathogenesis and advance the diagnosis and prevention of PCOS.

We assessed whether plasma phospholipid cis-palmitoleic acid was associated with heart failure risk.This ancillary study of the Physicians' Health Study used a risk set sampling method to select 788 matched pairs. For each case of incident heart failure, we randomly selected a control among subjects that were free of heart failure and alive at the time of index case diagnosis and matched on age, year of birth, race, and time of blood collection. Plasma phospholipid fatty acids were measured using gas chromatography. Heart failure was ascertained using annual follow-up questionnaire and validated in a subsample. In a multivariable conditional logistic regression, odds ratios (95% CI) for heart failure were 1.0 (ref), 1.06 (0.75-1.48), 1.20 (0.85-1.68), and 1.58 (1.11-2.25) across consecutive quartiles of cis-palmitoleic acid (P for trend 0.009). Each SD increase in plasma cis-palmitoleic acid was associated with 17% higher odds of heart failure (95% CI: 2% to 33%) in a multivariable model. In a secondary analysis, each SD increase of log-stearoyl-coA desaturase activity (16:1n-7/16:0 ratio) was positively associated with the risk of heart failure (odds ratio: 1.14 [95% CI: 1.00 to 1.29]), whereas oleic acid and cis- concentrations were not related to heart failure risk.Our data showed a positive association between plasma phospholipid cis- palmitoleic acid and heart failure risk in male physicians.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18095523>Trans fats, dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome: are we missing the cream?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22714958>The intestinal bioavailability of  and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and -γ in a rodent model of dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Evidence suggests a neutral to beneficial role of certain trans fatty acids (TFA) from natural ruminant sources. Trans11-18:1 (, VA), the most predominant ruminant TFA and a precursor to conjugated linoleic acid, has been shown to improve atherogenic dyslipidemia and symptoms of hepatic steatosis in animal models. The objective of this study was to assess the intestinal bioavailability of various VA sources including synthetic free fatty acid (FFA) and natural ruminant triglyceride forms, as well as the mechanistic pathways that mediate VA's bioactivity.VA acts as a partial agonist to both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-α and PPAR-γ in vitro, with similar affinity compared to commonly known PPAR agonists. It was further confirmed that VA at 30 and 100 μM concentrations suppressed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy vitro in a PPAR-α- and PPAR-γ-dependent manner. In vivo, feeding of VA (1%, w/w) resulted in increased mRNA and protein expression of PPAR-γ in the mucosa of JCR:LA-cp rats, a model of the metabolic syndrome (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) compared to control. In addition, VA from a triglyceride source had greater intestinal bioavailability in vivo compared to VA provided in an FFA form (p < 0.01).The activation of PPAR-α- and PPAR-γ-dependent pathways provides a mechanistic explanation of how VA improves blood lipids and related metabolic disorders during conditions of hyperlipidemia.

The objective of the present study was to explore the effects of VA on immune function in a model of the metabolic syndrome, JCR:LA-cp rats. Lean (2:1 mix of +/cp and +/+) and obese (cp/cp) rats, aged 8 weeks, were fed a control (0% VA) or a VA diet (1.5% (w/w) VA) for 3 weeks (twenty rats per group). Splenocytes and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) immune cell phenotypes (flow cytometry), ex vivo cytokine production (ELISA) and phospholipid fatty acid concentrations were measured. Obese rats had higher proportions of splenic macrophages, total T-cells, helper T-cells (total and percentage CD25+), cytotoxic T-cells (total and percentage CD25+) and produced higher concentrations of IL-6 to concanavalin A (ConA) compared with lean rats. Obese rats had lower proportions of MLN T-cells, new T-cells (CD3+CD90+) and cytotoxic T-cells, but higher proportions of helper cells that were CD45RC+, CD25+ and CD4lo, and produced higher concentrations of IL-2, IL-10, interferon gamma and TNFalpha in response to ConA compared with lean rats. VA was higher in plasma phospholipids and both VA and CLA (cis-9, trans-11) were higher in MLN phospholipids compared with control-fed rats. Lean VA-fed rats had lower proportions of MLN and splenocyte CD45RC+ helper cells, and helper T-cells. Splenocytes from VA-fed rats produced 16-23% less IL-2, IL-10 and TNFalpha compared with controls. VA normalised production of MLN IL-2 and TNFalpha in obese rats to levels similar to those seen in lean rats. These results indicate that dietary VA favourably alters the pro-inflammatory tendency of mesenteric lymphocytes from JCR:LA-cp rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22252473>Clinical dyslipidaemia is associated with changes in the lipid composition and inflammatory properties of apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins from women with type 2 .</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to use lipidomics to determine if the lipid composition of apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins is modified by dyslipidaemia in type 2  and if any of the identified changes potentially have biological relevance in the pathophysiology of type 2 .VLDL and LDL from normolipidaemic and dyslipidaemic type 2 diabetic women and controls were isolated and quantified with HPLC and mass spectrometry. A detailed molecular characterisation of VLDL triacylglycerols (TAG) was also performed using the novel ozone-induced dissociation method, which allowed us to distinguish  (C18:1 n-7) from oleic acid (C18:1 n-9) in specific TAG species.Lipid class composition was very similar in VLDL and LDL from normolipidaemic type 2 diabetic and control participants. By contrast, dyslipidaemia was associated with significant changes in both lipid classes (e.g. increased diacylglycerols) and lipid species (e.g. increased C16:1 and C20:3 in phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl ester and increased C16:0 [palmitic acid] and  in TAG). Levels of palmitic acid in VLDL and LDL TAG correlated with insulin resistance, and VLDL TAG enriched in palmitic acid promoted increased secretion of proinflammatory mediators from human smooth muscle cells.We showed that dyslipidaemia is associated with major changes in both lipid class and lipid species composition in VLDL and LDL from women with type 2 . In addition, we identified specific molecular lipid species that both correlate with clinical variables and are proinflammatory.

Three visits have been completed, totaling 6 years of follow-up.Individuals (n = 477) at risk for diabetes recruited from the general population in London and Toronto, Canada.Values from an oral glucose tolerance test were used to compute 1/HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index for IS, the insulinogenic index over HOMA-IR, and the insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 for β-cell function. Thin-layer chromatograph and gas chromatograph quantified FA. Generalized estimating equations were used for the analysis.IS and β-cell function declined by 8.3-19.4% over 6 years. In fully adjusted generalized estimating equation models, PL cis-vaccenate (18:1n-7) was positively associated with all outcomes, whereas γ-linolenate (GLA; 18:3n-6) and stearate (18:0) were negatively associated with IS. Tests for time interactions revealed that PL eicosadienoate (20:2n-6) and palmitate (16:0) and CE dihomo-γ-linolenate (20:3n-6), GLA, and palmitate had stronger associations with the outcomes after longer follow-up.In a Canadian population at risk for diabetes, we found that higher PL stearate and GLA and lower cis- predicted consistently lower IS and β-cell function over 6 years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23803879>Associations of erythrocyte fatty acids in the de novo lipogenesis pathway with risk of metabolic syndrome in a cohort study of middle-aged and older Chinese.</a></h2><p>Experimental studies suggest that elevated de novo lipogenesis (DNL) might be involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders.

We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor, arachidonic acid (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the  and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme,  acid amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05).

The aim of this study was to assess the potential of VA to improve dyslipidemia,  sensitivity, or inflammatory status in obese and -resistant JCR:LA-cp rats. The obese rats and age-matched lean littermates were fed a control diet or a control diet supplemented with 1.5% (wt:wt) VA for a period of 3 wk. The incorporation of VA and subsequent conversion to CLA in triglyceride was measured in adipose tissue. Glucose and  metabolism were assessed via a conscious adapted meal tolerance test procedure. Plasma lipids as well as serum inflammatory cytokine concentrations were measured by commercially available assays. VA supplementation did not result in any observable adverse health effects in either lean or obese JCR:LA-cp rats. After 3 wk of feeding, body weight, food intake, and glucose/ metabolism did not differ between VA-supplemented and control groups. The incorporation of VA and CLA into adipose triglycerides in obese rats fed VA increased by 1.5-fold and 6.5-fold, respectively, compared with obese rats fed the control diet. The most striking effect was a 40% decrease (P < 0.05) in fasting triglyceride concentrations in VA-treated obese rats relative to obese controls.

Although there were no differences in circulating triglyceride levels between normoglycaemic-normoinsulinaemic and hyperglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic men, inspection of individual FA revealed that  was enriched with hyperglycaemia-hyperinsulinaemia. Moreover,  levels were positively correlated with  and HOMA-IR. This reinforces that examination of individual FA in the context of  is warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281760>Deletion of ELOVL6 blocks the synthesis of oleic acid but does not prevent the development of fatty liver or insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Elongation of very long chain fatty acid-like family member 6 (ELOVL6) is a fatty acyl elongase that performs the initial and rate-limiting condensing reaction required for microsomal elongation of long-chain fatty acids. Our previous in vitro studies suggested that ELOVL6 elongated long-chain saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids with chain lengths of 12 to 16 carbons. Here, we describe the generation and phenotypic characterization of Elovl6(-/-) mice. As predicted from the in vitro studies, livers from Elovl6(-/-) mice accumulated palmitic (C16:0) and palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) fatty acids and contained significantly less stearic (C18:0) and oleic (C18:1, n-9) acids, confirming that ELOVL6 is the only enzyme capable of elongating palmitate (C16:0). Unexpectedly, Elovl6(-/-) mice produced  (C18:1, n-7), the elongated product of palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7), suggesting that palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7) to vaccenate (C18:1, n-7) elongation was not specific to ELOVL6. The only detected consequence of deleting Elovl6(-/-) in mice was that their livers accumulated significantly more triglycerides than wild-type mice when fed a fat-free/high-carbohydrate diet. When mice were fed a high-fat diet or ELOVL6 was deleted in ob/ob mice, the absence of ELOVL6 did not alter the development of , fatty liver, hyperglycemia, or hyperinsulinemia. Combined, these results suggest that palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) and vaccenic (C18:1, n-7) acids can largely replace the roles of oleic acid (C18:1, n-9) in vivo and that the deletion of ELOVL6 does not protect mice from the development of hepatic steatosis or insulin resistance.Copyright © 2014 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p></html>
