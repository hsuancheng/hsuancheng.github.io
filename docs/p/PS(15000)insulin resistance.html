Our hypothesis was that, instead, initiation of ventricular hypertrophy in obesity may be explained by changes in hormonal milieu and not by cavity dilatation.88 female subjects without identifiable cardiovascular risk factors, covering a wide range of body mass indices (BMI), from normal (21.2 ± 1.6 kg/m(2)) to severely obese (45. ± 4.6 kg/m(2)), underwent cardiovascular MRI to determine left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) mass and volumes.BMI correlated positively with LV and RV mass and end-diastolic volumes (EDV). However overweight is associated with a significant LV and RV hypertrophy (LV: 78 ± 11 g vs 103 ± 16 g, p<.01; RV: 26 ± 7 g vs 40 ± 11 g, p<.01) was observed in the absence of differences in LV and RV volumes (LV: EDV 119 ±  vs 121 ± 21 ml, p>.99, RV: 131 ± 17 vs 130 ± 24 ml; p>.99). Furthermore, significant increases of serum leptin occurred at this pre-obese stage (.6 ± 19 vs 36.5 ± 22 ng/ml; p=.013).In a cohort of healthy female subjects with a wide range of BMIs, ventricular hypertrophy occurs without associated cavity dilatation in overweight individuals, while in manifest obesity, both cavity dilatation and ventricular hypertrophy occur. Elevated leptin levels may have a role in this effect on ventricular mass.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21419463>Adolescent oligomenorrhea in a biracial schoolgirl cohort: a simple clinical parameter predicting impaired fasting glucose plus type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin, glucose, insulin resistance, and centripetal obesity from age 19 to 25 years.</a></h1><p>We hypothesized that adolescent oligomenorrhea (ages 14-19) would independently predict impaired fasting glucose (IFG; ≥110 to <126 mg/dL) plus type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; ≥126 mg/dL), insulin and glucose levels, and insulin resistance (IR) in young adulthood (ages 19-25). A prospective -year follow-up of 370 schoolgirls starting at age 10 was performed. Age 14 waist circumference was the most important explanatory variable for IFG + T2DM during ages 19 to 24 (P = .002; odds ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.10), along with oligomenorrhea category from ages 14 to 19 (, 1, 2, ≥3 reports over 6 years; P = .032; odds ratio, 1.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-3.14). Impaired fasting glucose + T2DM at ages 19 to 24 were more common in girls having 1 (6%), 2 (11%), and ≥3 (38%) oligomenorrhea reports from ages 14 to 19 than in girls without oligomenorrhea (3%; P = .0003). Positive explanatory variables (all  ≤ .05) for homeostasis model assessment of IR at ages 19 to 24 included age 14 waist (partial R(2) = 30.1%), oligomenorrhea with hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary ; partial R(2) = 4.1%), black race (3.8%), and oligomenorrhea frequency during ages 14 to 19 (.8%); sex hormone binding globulin was a negative explanatory variable (.7%). This is the first prospective study to report an independent association of adolescent oligomenorrhea with young adult IFG + T2DM, with insulin and glucose levels, and with IR. Age 14 waist circumference, oligomenorrhea with hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary ), black race, oligomenorrhea frequency at ages 14 to 19, and age 14 sex hormone binding globulin were independently associated with IR at ages 19 to 24, potentially facilitating primary prevention of IFG, T2DM, and hyperinsulinemia.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Because pST inhibits the hypoglycemic effects of , an  tolerance test procedure was established to measure pST activity in jugular-catheterized pigs. Doses of , 30, 100, and 300 micrograms/kg per day of pST were split and administered subcutaneously (sc) in equal portions twice daily for 2 d. After a 17-hr fast, plasma samples were obtained at 10-min intervals for 30 min before an intravenous injection of  (.08 IU/kg) and then for an additional 50 min. Because pST increased fasting plasma glucose concentrations, preinsulin glucose values were used as a covariate to adjust the postinsulin concentrations. pST caused a dose-dependent increase in  to the  injection in these pigs. The areas under the curves (AUC), for plasma glucose were 22.1, 29., 39., and 47.2 mg/dl per min for the , 30, 100, and 300 micrograms/kg pST doses, respectively. Because different doses of pST could be detected, the -7.6 enhancement of pST treatment was evaluated. In the first experiment, five pigs/group each received sc injections of either vehicle, pST (75 micrograms/kg; approximately 3. mg/d), pST (75 micrograms/kg) + -7.6 at 3.75 mg/kg, or pST (75 micrograms/kg) + -7.6 at  mg/kg for 2 d before the  test. The pST and -7.6 were combined and incubated for at least 1 hr at room temperature before being injected. The injection of pST alone did not significantly change  tolerance activity (23.1 vs. 21.1, AUC), but   was enhanced when this dose of pST also included -7.6 (27.4 and 29.5, AUC, respectively; P < .05). In a second experiment, the effects of -7.6 and -4.2, a mAb that did not potentiate the pST-stimulated growth of hypox rats, were compared. The five pigs/treatment received either vehicle, pST (75 micrograms/kg), pST (75 micrograms/kg) + -7.6 (3.75 mg/kg), or pST (75 micrograms/kg) + -4.2 (3.75 mg/kg) for 2 d. The administration of pST increased the  to  (26.7 vs. 18.8, AUC; P < .01), which was markedly potentiated by -7.6 (54.3, AUC, P < .001) but not affected by -4.2 (27.6 AUC). The injection of -7.6 at 7.5 mg/kg without exogenous pST did not alter the sensitivity to . These results indicate that -7.6, but not -4.2, enhanced the  antagonistic activity of pST in swine, suggesting that an enhancement of pST-stimulated growth would also occur in -7.6-treated pigs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31086609>Maternal dietary glycaemic change during gestation influences insulin-related gene methylation in the placental tissue: a genome-wide methylation analysis.</a></h1><p>Studies have shown that the effects of maternal nutrition exposure during gestation influence metabolic risk in early life through an epigenetic mechanism. Low glycaemic index (GI) diets benefit both maternal and neonatal gestational outcomes. We hypothesize that maternal dietary GI or glycaemic load (GL) changes during pregnancy impact placental DNA methylation, especially in insulin resistance-related genes.From a clinical trial of overweight pregnant women, 12 subjects who successfully reduced their GI and another 12 whose GI increased despite the intervention were selected. A genome-wide differential methylation analysis of placental tissue DNA was conducted, followed by bioinformatic annotation and validation analysis. The distribution of genome-wide differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and CpG sites was described. Six CpG sites in regulatory regions of four insulin-related genes (, , , and ) were selectively validated by pyrosequencing. Pairwise Spearman correlation analysis was performed to test methylation-phenotype association in an additional 153 subjects from the same trial. Correlation between methylation of significant sites and placental mRNA expression of  was also analysed.Dietary GI decreased by 24.3 (26.2-20.1) in the group who responded appropriately to the intervention and increased by 19.6 (.2-29.1) in the comparison group. Epigenome-wide analysis identified 108 DMRs and 365 CpG sites with  < .05 adjusted by false discovery rate, distributed over all chromosomes. The methylation level of cg05009389 in the 3' UTR of  was negatively correlated with maternal weight gain ( = - .21,  = .027) and increase in insulin levels ( = - .24,  = .015) during gestation. Methylation levels of cg17586860 and cg18197392 in the 5' UTR region of  were negatively correlated with changes in dietary carbohydrate intake ( = - .24, s ≤ .006) and GL across gestation ( = - .23, s ≤ .008). This correlation survived the adjustment for maternal factors such as dietary GI, body mass index, and gestational . Up to 89% of cg18197392 methylation was explained by GL change. Cg14631053 methylation correlated positively with mRNA expression of  in the placenta ( = .20,  = .037)We provide the first evidence that maternal dietary GI changes during gestation may impact placental DNA methylation of insulin regulation genes. This supports the hypothesis that placental methylation may be the epigenetic mechanism through which maternal diet influences the metabolic health of offspring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982924>A High-Fiber Diet Decreases Postabsorptive Protein Turnover but Does Not Alter Insulin Sensitivity in Men with Type 1  Mellitus.</a></h1><p>High-fiber diets (HFDs) are recommended in the diet of persons with , yet such diets can impair macronutrient digestion and/or absorption, modify insulin sensitivity, and reset metabolism.We studied the effects of a HFD on the kinetics of whole-body protein, a macronutrient that could be affected by dietary fiber, in type 1  mellitus (T1DM), under both basal-low insulinemic and hyperinsulinemic conditions.Eight men with T1DM (body mass index range: 21.8-27.8 kg/m2) were studied twice - before and after the addition of guar gum (∼ g/d) to their usual diet for ∼4 mo. Whole-body protein degradation (i.e., the rate of appearance [Ra] of endogenous leucine), leucine disposal to protein synthesis (), deamination, and reamination, were determined before and after the HFD, both in the postabsorptive state and following a euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, hyperaminoacidemic clamp, using isotope dilution methods.After the HFD, mean values (± SEs) for postabsorptive leucine Ra decreased by ∼20%: from 2.52 (.) to 2.03 (.16) μmol x kg-1 x min-1, P < .049, after vs. before the HFD respectively.  also decreased, by ∼25%: from 2.03 (.) to 1.57 (.), P < .045. Leucine concentration (P = .1) and reamination (P = .095) decreased moderately, whereas deamination was unchanged. Following the clamp, plasma amino acid concentrations (P < .001), leucine deamination (+ ∼50%, P < .00002), reamination (+ ∼30%, P < .0007), and  (+ ∼35%, P < .00001) were all increased compared with postabsorptive state values, whereas endogenous leucine Ra was suppressed (by %, P < .00001, and by 25%, P < .001, with the primary or the reciprocal pool models, respectively). No significant differences in these insulin effects before compared with after the HFD were observed. Metabolic control (glycated hemoglobin), daily insulin requirement, and insulin-mediated glucose disposal were unchanged after the HFD.A HFD downregulates postabsorptive protein turnover in men with T1DM, by decreasing both protein degradation and synthesis, possibly due to a subtle decrease and/or delay in amino acid absorption. It does not significantly affect the insulin (and amino acid sensitivity) to protein turnover, glucose disposal, and metabolic control.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18460559>Effects of Intrabrachial metacholine infusion on muscle capillary recruitment and forearm glucose uptake during physiological hyperinsulinemia in obese, -resistant individuals.</a></h1><p>Impairment of -mediated capillary recruitment in skeletal muscle contributes to a hampered glucose uptake in obesity.The objective of this study was to evaluate whether metacholine (MCh), a nitric oxide vasodilator, potentiates muscle capillary recruitment and forearm glucose uptake (FGU) during physiological hyperinsulinemia.The double-forearm technique [i.e. infused vs. control (Ctrl) forearm] was combined with im microdialysis during an oral glucose tolerance test in  nondiabetic, obese subjects divided into a group of -resistant (IR) (n = 7) and -sensitive (n = 8) individuals.After the oral glucose tolerance test, forearm blood flow in the Ctrl forearm was unchanged, whereas it increased about 3-fold (P < .0001 vs. baseline) in response to MCh. Capillary permeability surface area product for glucose ((glu)) (capillary recruitment), FGU, and interstitial  concentrations increased significantly over time (P < .001) in both forearms. Compared with -sensitive, the IR subjects exhibited lower (glu) (P < .001) and FGU (P < .01) in the Ctrl arm, whereas this difference was insignificant in the MCh arm despite the blunted forearm blood flow increase. Moreover, in IR individuals MCh significantly (P < .05) ameliorated the delayed onset of  action, i.e. the FGU response to hyperinsulinemia. Finally, we found (glu) to be a strong and independent predictor of FGU response (adjusted R(2) .72; P < .0001).MCh-induced vasodilation may improve the microvascular and metabolic responses to physiological hyperinsulinemia in obese, IR individuals. Further studies are required to unravel whether stimulation of nitric oxide production in skeletal muscle may represent an attractive therapeutic approach to bypassing cellular  to glucose disposal.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548294>The effect of L-thyroxine substitution on lipid profile, glucose homeostasis, inflammation and coagulation in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.</a></h1><p>Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis, mainly attributable to dyslipidaemia and hypercoagulability. However, conflicting data exist regarding the effect of L-thyroxine substitution on these parameters. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of L-thyroxine therapy on lipidaemic profile, coagulation markers, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and glucose homoeostasis in SH patients.It was a prospective open-label study. The following parameters were measured before and 6 months after intervention: anthropometric data, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apolipoproteins B (apoB) and A1 (apoA1), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], fasting plasma glucose and insulin, homoeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), hsCRP, antithrombin III (AT-III), protein C (PC), protein S (), fibrinogen and homocysteine.Thirty-two patients (30 women) aged 52.1 ± 13.9 years with SH completed the study. Baseline mean TSH levels were 6.79 ± 2.58 mIU/ml. Achievement of euthyroidism significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (BP) in patients with SH (from 135.2 ± 18.5 to 129.7 ± .8 mmHg, p = .03) and diastolic BP only in those with baseline TSH levels > 7 mIU/ml (from 79.5 ± 9.8 to 72.1 ± 7.3 mmHg, p = .03). No significant changes in body weight, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, apoB, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, hsCRP, AT-III, PC, , fibrinogen or homocysteine levels were noticed after restoration of euthyroidism, except for a decrease in apoA1 (p = .04) and an increase in Lp(a) levels (p = .02).Except for a reduction in systolic and diastolic BP, thyroid substitution therapy does not affect lipidaemic profile, systematic inflammation, glucose homoeostasis or coagulation in patients with SH.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27147618>Carbohydrate ingestion induces sex-specific cardiac vagal inhibition, but not vascular sympathetic modulation, in healthy older women.</a></h1><p>The role of vagal function in cardiovascular risk in older women remains unclear. Autonomic modulation following carbohydrate ingestion (CI) and postural stress () were investigated in 14 healthy men and 21 age-matched postmenopausal women (age: 65. ± 2.1 vs. 64.1 ± 1.6 years), with normal and comparable insulin sensitivity. Continuous noninvasive finger arterial pressure and ECG were recorded in the lying and the standing positions before and after ingestion of a carbohydrate-rich meal (600 kcal, carbohydrate 78%, protein 13%, and fat 8%). Low-frequency (LF, .04-. Hz) and high-frequency (HF, .-.4 Hz) components (ms(2)) of heart rate variability (HRV), low-frequency power (mmHg(2)) of systolic blood pressure variability (SBP LF power), and the sequence method for spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS, ms/mmHg) were used to quantify autonomic modulation. In response to CI and , mean arterial pressure maintained stable, and heart rate increased in women and men in the lying and standing positions. Following CI (60, 90, and 120 min postprandially) in the standing position, SBP LF power increased by 40% in men (P = .02), with unchanged HRV parameters; in contrast, in women, HRV HF power halved (P = .02), with unaltered SBP LF power. During  before and after CI, similar magnitude of SBP LF power, HRV, and BRS changes was observed in men and women. In conclusion, CI induces sex-specific vascular sympathetic activation in healthy older men, and cardiac vagal inhibition in healthy older women; this CI-mediated efferent vagal inhibition may suggest differential cardiovascular risk factors in women, irrespective of insulin resistance, and impairment of autonomic control.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25772036>Sarcopaenia is associated with NAFLD independently of  and insulin resistance: Nationwide surveys (KNHANES 2008-2011).</a></h1><p>Although sarcopaenia is associated with -related comorbidities, its influence on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or steatohepatitis has not been fully determined. We aimed to investigate the direct relationship between sarcopaenia and NAFLD or steatohepatitis in the general population.We conducted a cross-sectional study using nationally representative samples of ,132 subjects from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2008-2011. Subjects were defined as having NAFLD when they had higher scores from previously validated NAFLD prediction models such as the hepatic steatosis index, comprehensive NAFLD score and NAFLD liver fat score. BARD and FIB-4 scores were used to define advanced fibrosis in subjects with NAFLD. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) [SMI(%)=total appendicular skeletal muscle mass (kg)/weight (kg)×100] measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to diagnose sarcopaenia with cut points of 32.2% for men and 25.5% for women.SMI was inversely correlated with all NAFLD predicting scores (<.001). After stratification, sarcopaenic subjects had an increased risk of NAFLD regardless of  (odds ratios [ORs]=1.55 to 3.02, depending on models; all <.001) or metabolic syndrome (ORs=1.63 to 4.00, all <.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis also demonstrated this independent association between sarcopaenia and NAFLD after adjusting for confounding factors related to  or insulin resistance (ORs=1.18 to 1.22, all <.001). Furthermore, among the NAFLD population, subjects with lower SMIs were likely to have advanced fibrosis compared with non-sarcopaenic individuals (BARD and FIB-4: ORs=1.83 and 1.69, respectively; both <.001). Compared with non-exercised subjects, individuals who exercised regularly had a lower risk of NAFLD (p<.001), particularly among obese people with well-preserved muscle mass.Sarcopaenia is associated with increased risks of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, independent of  or metabolic control.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

We hypothesized that baseline IR would be positively associated with follow-up body mass index (BMI) and fat mass.Two hundred and forty-nine healthy African American and Caucasian children aged 6-12 years at high risk for adult  because of early-onset childhood overweight and/or parental overweight were followed for up to  years with repeated BMI and fat mass measurements. We examined baseline serum insulin and homeostasis model of assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) as predictors of follow-up BMI Z-score and fat mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in mixed model longitudinal analyses accounting for baseline body composition, pubertal stage, sociodemographic factors and follow-up interval.At baseline, 39% were obese (BMI⩾95th percentile for age/sex). Data from 1335 annual visits were examined. Children were followed for an average of 7.2±4.3 years, with a maximum follow-up of  years. After accounting for covariates, neither baseline insulin nor HOMA-IR was significantly associated with follow-up BMI (>.26), BMIz score (>.22), fat mass (>.78) or fat mass percentage (>.71). In all models, baseline BMI (P<.0001), body fat mass (P<.0001) and percentage of fat (P<.001) were strong positive predictors for change in BMI and fat mass. In models restricted to children without  at baseline, some but not all models had significant interaction terms between body adiposity and insulinemia/HOMA-IR that suggested less gain in mass among those with greater insulin or IR. The opposite was found in some models restricted to children with  at baseline.In middle childhood, BMI and fat mass, but not insulin or IR, are strong predictors of children's gains in BMI and fat mass during adolescence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30657205>Insulin resistance is associated with hirsutism in unselected reproductive-aged women.</a></h1><p>Hirsutism affects 5%-10% of reproductive-aged women worldwide and exhibits clinical importance as a cutaneous manifestation of underlying hyperandrogenism. Racial and genetic factors play roles in manifestation of hirsutism, and the prevalence of hirsutism seems to be low in East Asians. However, the reference value of the modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) score to diagnose hirsutism and the prevalence of hirsutism have not been determined in Korean populations to date. We aimed to investigate the distribution of the mFG score and establish its reference value for defining hirsutism and to examine its relationship with metabolic and reproductive traits in reproductive-aged Korean women.We enrolled 2139 female volunteers of reproductive age (-39 years). We recorded mFG scores from  to 4 on 9 different body locations (upper lip, chin, chest, arm, upper abdomen, lower abdomen, upper back, lower back and thighs). Hirsutism was defined as >95th percentile of mFG score. In addition, a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was performed, and the homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated.The mFG values of the 50th, 75th, 90th and 95th percentiles were , 1, 4 and 6, respectively. Therefore, the mFG score was indicative of hirsutism when the score was 6 or greater, which represents the 95th percentile. In the correlation analysis, total testosterone, free testosterone, fasting plasma insulin and HOMA-IR were positively correlated with mFG score (all  <.05). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that HOMA-IR (β = .081) was positively associated with mFG score after adjustments for age, body mass index, total testosterone and the number of menses per year (P < .001).In conclusion, setting the 95th percentile of the mFG score as normal, the reference value to define hirsutism was 6 in reproductive-aged Korean women. HOMA-IR was positively associated with the mFG score even after adjustment for biochemical hyperandrogenism.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20720426>The relationship between insulin resistance and hypercoagulability in acute ischemic stroke.</a></h1><p>Insulin resistance has effects on the coagulation system, which is important in the acute phase of infarct.
