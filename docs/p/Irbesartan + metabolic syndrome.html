Treatment of patients with MetS regularly includes drugs prescribed simultaneously to treat diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the development of novel multidrug formulations is recommended. However, the main problem with these drugs is their low solubility. The use of binary co-amorphous systems emerges as a promising strategy to increase drug solubility. In the present study,  (IBS) and glimepiride (GMP), class II active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), widely used in the treatment of arterial hypertension and diabetes, were selected to develop a novel binary co-amorphous system with remarkable enhancement in the dissolution of both APIs. The phase diagram of IBS-GMP was constructed and co-amorphous systems were prepared by melt-quench, in a wide range of compositions. Dissolution profile (studied at pH 1.2 and 37°C for mole fractions 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5) demonstrated that the x = 0.01 formulation presents the highest enhancement in its dissolution. GMP went from being practically insoluble to reach 3.9 ± 0.9 μg/mL, and IBS showed a 12-fold increment with respect to the dissolution of its crystalline form. Infrared studies showed that the increase in the dissolution profile is related to the intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonds), which were dependent of composition. Results of structural and thermal characterization performed by XRD and DSC showed that samples have remained in amorphous state for more than 10 months of storage. This work contributes to the development of a highly soluble co-amorphous drugs with potential used in the treatment of MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678944>Combining  and trichlormethiazide enhances blood pressure reduction via inhibition of sympathetic activity without adverse effects on metabolism in hypertensive rats with metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Sympathoexcitation and oxidative stress in the brain have pivotal roles in hypertension with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Here, we examined whether oral administration of  (IRB) and trichlormethiazide (TCM) decreases blood pressure (BP) via inhibiting sympathetic activity through anti-oxidant effects in the brain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-cp). IRB/TCM treatment decreased BP more profoundly than IRB monotherapy. Urinary norepinephrine excretion and oxidative stress in the brain were decreased in both IRB and IRB/TCM groups without any adverse effect on the metabolic profile. These findings suggest that IRB/TCM profoundly decreases BP in SHR-cp by inhibiting sympathetic activity via anti-oxidant effects in the brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27653164>Fixed-dose combination of zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide vs.  plus hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients with established metabolic syndrome uncontrolled by previous monotherapy. The ZAMES study (Zofenopril in Advanced MEtabolic Syndrome).</a></h2><p>Whether all antihypertensive drugs are equally effective in patients with metabolic syndrome is still unclear. The goal of the Zofenopril in Advanced MEtabolic Syndrome (ZAMES) study was to investigate whether treatment with the fixed-dose combination of sulphydril-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide is at least as effective as that with the angiotensin receptor blocker  plus hydrochlorothiazide in patients with metabolic syndrome and essential hypertension, uncontrolled by a previous monotherapy.We enrolled 721 patients in a multicenter, international (Italy and Romania), randomized, double-blind, parallel group, phase III study. Following a 1-week screening withdrawal period, 482 patients (mean age 59 ± 10 years, 53% men) bearing a SBP at least 140 mmHg and/or DBP at least 90 mmHg plus metabolic syndrome (ATP-III criteria) were randomly allocated to a fixed-dose combination of zofenopril 30 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg or  150 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily for a cumulative period of 24 weeks. After 8 and 16 weeks, zofenopril and  doses were doubled in nonnormalized study participants. The study endpoint was the office DBP reduction at study end. In 20% of patients, an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed.The prevalence of diabetes at baseline was significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide group (82%) than in the  plus hydrochlorothiazide (73%) group. Baseline-adjusted DBP reductions were superimposable (P = 0.370) with zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide [n = 231; 9.8 (95% confidence interval: 11.1, 8.4) mmHg] and  plus hydrochlorothiazide [n = 235; 10.4 (11.8, 9.0) mmHg]. The same was for SBP [17.0 (19.2, 14.8) mmHg zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide vs. 18.8 (21.0, 16.6) mmHg  plus hydrochlorothiazide, P = 0.113]. Rate of normalized and responder patients (SBP/DBP < 140/90 mmHg or SBP reduction more than 20 mmHg or DBP reduction more than 10 mmHg) did not differ at study end (65.8% and 77.5% zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide vs. 67.7% and 81.5%  plus hydrochlorothiazide; P = 0.695, P = 0.301). These results were confirmed in the 69 study participants undergoing ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (35 zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide; 34  plus hydrochlorothiazide), with a comparable 24-h average BP reduction [BP difference between-treatment: SBP: 0.1 (-5.7, 5.9) mmHg, P = 0.975; DBP: -0.9 (-3.8, 2.0) mmHg, P = 0.541]. Both drugs attained similar BP reductions also in the last 6 h of the dosing interval [between-treatment difference SBP: 0.1 (-7.4, 7.5) mmHg P = 0.990; DBP: -0.9 (-4.4, 2.6) mmHg, P = 0.602]. Metabolic and renal indexes were not altered. Few patients were withdrawn for moderate adverse events (5% zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide; 5%  plus hydrochlorothiazide).This is the first study supporting the comparable antihypertensive and metabolic response to fixed-dose combinations of sulphydril-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (zofenopril) or angiotensin receptor blockers () with a diuretic in patients with advanced metabolic syndrome and nonresponders to monotherapy. The results of this study can further improve the clinical management of high cardiovascular risk patients with hypertension and metabolic syndrome, because these two drug combinations increase the number of available combinations, which may significantly improve patients' adherence in this special clinical condition that is frequently found in everyday practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25703678>The cost-effectiveness of  for hypertension.</a></h2><p>High blood pressure is a very common problem in the adult and elderly population, both in developed and developing countries. A relatively large number of drug classes are available to treat this condition and prevent its complications, which are not only more frequent in the aforementioned patients but also those affected by metabolic syndrome and/or Type 2 diabetes.  is an angiotensin-receptor blocker class drug with good antihypertensive efficacy and specific pharmacological characteristics, whose efficacy has been more deeply evaluated in metabolically complex hypertensive patients. In this review, the authors will analyze its effectiveness in preventing or delaying organ damage in hypertensive patients, with a closer look at the economic implications of treating hypertension with  in the context of available antihypertensive drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28179883>New microRNA Biomarkers for Drug-Induced Steatosis and Their Potential to Predict the Contribution of Drugs to Non-alcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p> Drug-induced steatosis is a major reason for drug failure in clinical trials and post-marketing withdrawal; and therefore, predictive biomarkers are essential. These could be particularly relevant in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), where most patients show features of the metabolic syndrome and are prescribed with combined chronic therapies, which can contribute to . However, specific biomarkers to assess the contribution of drugs to NAFLD are lacking. We aimed to find microRNAs (miRNAs) responsive to steatotic drugs and to investigate if they could become circulating biomarkers for drug-induced steatosis.  Human HepG2 cells were treated with drugs and changes in miRNA levels were measured by microarray and qRT-PCR. Drug-induced fat accumulation in HepG2 was analyzed by high-content screening and enzymatic methods. miRNA biomarkers were also analyzed in the sera of 44 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients and in 10 controls.  We found a set of 10 miRNAs [miR-22-5p, -3929, -24-2-5p, -663a, -29a-3p, -21 (5p and 3p), -27a-5p, -1260 and -202-3p] that were induced in human HepG2 cells and secreted to the culture medium upon incubation with model steatotic drugs (valproate, doxycycline, cyclosporin A and tamoxifen). Moreover, cell exposure to 17 common drugs for NAFLD patients showed that some of them (e.g., , fenofibrate, and omeprazole) also induced these miRNAs and increased intracellular triglycerides, particularly in combinations. Finally, we found that most of these miRNAs (60%) were detected in human serum, and that NAFLD patients under fibrates showed both induction of these miRNAs and a more severe steatosis grade.  Steatotic drugs induce a common set of hepatic miRNAs that could be used in drug screening during preclinical development. Moreover, most of these miRNAs are serum circulating biomarkers that could become useful in the diagnosis of iatrogenic steatosis.</p></html>
