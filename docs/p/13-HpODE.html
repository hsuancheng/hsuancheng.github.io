It was found that all chemico-physical stresses enhanced ultraweak light emission from the bacterial cells, the most effective treatment being electroporation (up to 20-fold increase in luminescence compared to the control value), followed by oxidative stress with 9- or 13-HPOD (up to 4-fold increase) and irradiation with UV light (up to 2.8-fold increase).

Ligand-dependent PPAR protein turnover is promoted by ubiquitination, but attenuated by binding to its co-activator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1α). The objective of our study was to investigate if the dual atherogenic effects of ω-6 lipids are due to its regulation of PPAR turnover.In rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs), oxidized linoleic acid (OxLA) at 10-50 μM induced and stabilized PPARα protein at earlier time points (0-4 h) but suppressed it at 12 h. Conversely, it activated PPARγ protein turnover at a later time point (12 h). Pre-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor (MG132) prevented OxLA mediated loss of PPAR stability and transactivity. Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated a ligand mediated time-dependent reciprocal exchange of PPAR interaction between ubiquitination and PGC-1α. This ω-6  mediated time-dependent switch between PPAR degradation versus stability helped modulate the pro and anti-atherogenic effects of these dietary lipids.Our findings provide insights into the dual pro and anti-atherogenic effects of dietary ω-6 lipids on vascular cells by the regulation of PPAR turnover.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The apoA-I-associated seeding molecules included hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (HPODE) and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE). LDL from mice genetically susceptible to fatty streak lesion formation was highly susceptible to oxidation by artery wall cells and was rendered resistant to oxidation after incubation with apoA-I in vitro. Injection of apoA-I (but not apoA-II or murine serum albumin) into mice rendered their LDL resistant to oxidation within 3 h. Infusion of apoA-I into humans rendered their LDL resistant to oxidation within 6 h. We conclude that 1) oxidation of LDL by artery wall cells requires seeding molecules that include HPODE and HPETE; 2) LDL from mice genetically susceptible to atherogenesis is more readily oxidized by artery wall cells; and 3) normal HDL and its components can remove or inhibit the activity of lipids in freshly isolated LDL that are required for oxidation by human artery wall cells.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10667355>13(S)-HpODE augments epidermal growth factor signal transduction by attenuating EGF receptor dephosphorylation.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9480835>Calcium ions potentiate lipoxygenase activity of cytochrome c at the physiological pH.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome c oxidized linoleic acid, with lipoxygenase-like activity, to 9-hydroperoxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid (9-HpODE),  (), 13-keto-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13-KODE), and hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoic acids (HEPOs) in the presence of calcium chloride at the physiological pH of 7.5.

This work reports a new facet of the putative CYP74C HPLs. Initially, we found that the recombinant CYP74C13_MT (Medicago truncatula) behaved predominantly as the epoxyalcohol synthase (EAS) towards the 9(S)-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid. At the same time, the CYP74C13_MT mostly possessed the HPL activity towards the 13(S)-hydroperoxides of linoleic and α-linolenic acids. To verify whether this dualistic behaviour of CYP74C13_MT is occasional or typical, we also examined five similar putative HPLs (CYP74C). These were CYP74C4_ST (Solanum tuberosum), CYP74C2 (Cucumis melo), CYP74C1_CS and CYP74C31 (both of Cucumis sativus), and CYP74C13_GM (Glycine max). All tested enzymes behaved predominantly as EAS toward 9-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid. Oxiranyl carbinols such as (9S,10S,11S,12Z)-9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acids were the major EAS products. Besides, the CYP74C31 possessed an additional minor 9-AOS activity. The mutant forms of CYP74C13_MT, CYP74C1_CS, and CYP74C31 with substitutions at the catalytically essential domains, namely the "hydroperoxide-binding domain" (I-helix), or the SRS-1 domain near the N-terminus, showed strong AOS activity.

Therefore, we examined the formation and bioactivity of AA metabolites in porcine coronary (PC) microvascular endothelial cells and microvessels, respectively. The major noncyclooxygenase metabolite produced by microvascular endothelial cells was 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), a lipoxygenase product. 12(S)-HETE release was markedly increased by pretreatment with 13(S)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid but not by the reduced congener 13(S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, suggesting oxidative upregulation of 12(S)-HETE output. 12(S)-HETE produced potent relaxation and hyperpolarization of PC microvessels (EC(50), expressed as -log[M] = 13.5 +/- 0.5). Moreover, 12(S)-HETE potently activated large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents in PC microvascular smooth muscle cells. In contrast, 12(S)-HETE was not a major product of conduit PC endothelial AA  and did not exhibit potent bioactivity in conduit PC arteries.

Human aortic wall cells were found to contain 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) protein. Transfection of the cells with antisense to 12-LO (but not sense) eliminated the 12-LO protein and prevented LDL-induced monocyte chemotactic activity. Addition of 13(S)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid [13(S)-HPODE] and 15(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid [15(S)-HPETE] dramatically enhanced the nonenzymatic oxidation of both 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC) and cholesteryl linoleate. On a molar basis 13(S)-HPODE and 15(S)-HPETE were approximately two orders of magnitude greater in potency than hydrogen peroxide in causing the formation of biologically active oxidized phospholipids (m/z 594, 610, and 828) from PAPC. Purified paraoxonase inhibited the biologic activity of these oxidized phospholipids. HDL from 10 of 10 normolipidemic patients with coronary artery disease, who were neither diabetic nor receiving hypolipidemic medications, failed to inhibit LDL oxidation by artery wall cells and failed to inhibit the biologic activity of oxidized PAPC, whereas HDL from 10 of 10 age- and sex-matched control subjects did. We conclude that a) mildly oxidized LDL is formed in three steps, one of which involves 12-LO and each of which can be inhibited by normal HDL, and b) HDL from at least some coronary artery disease patients with normal blood lipid levels is defective both in its ability to prevent LDL oxidation by artery wall cells and in its ability to inhibit the biologic activity of oxidized PAPC.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8568469>Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase in porcine anterior pituitary cells: its localization and possible function in gonadotrophs.</a></h2><p>Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, which oxygenates positions 12 and 13 of arachidonic and linoleic acids, is present in porcine anterior pituitary cells. Colocalization of the 12-lipoxygenase with various pituitary hormones was examined by immunohistochemical double-staining using antibodies against 12-lipoxygenase and various anterior pituitary hormones. Under light microscopy, approximately 7% of the cells producing luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were positive for 12-lipoxygenase, whereas the enzyme was detected in less than 2% of the cells producing thyrotrophin, prolactin, growth hormone (GH), and adrenocorticotrophin. In an attempt to examine the participation of 12-lipoxygenase metabolites in pituitary hormone release, we incubated the primary culture of porcine anterior pituitary cells with 12-hydroperoxy-arachidonic acid or 13-hydroperoxy-linoleic acid. Significant stimulation of LH and FSH release by these hydroperoxides was observed at 10 microM in a time-dependent manner. At doses around 10 microM these compounds produced responses of similar magnitude to 1 nM gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), but higher concentrations (30 microM) of the compounds were required for GH release. In contrast, 12-hydroxy-arachidonic and 13-hydroxy-linoleic acids were almost ineffective. Furthermore, the gonadotrophin release by 1 nM GnRH was inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (a lipoxygenase inhibitor) with an IC50 of about 5 microM.

An immunochemical analysis has evidenced a ca. 80 kDa protein, cross-reacting with an anti-LOX antibody, only in the pulp fraction of berries obtained from plants of both cultivations. LOX activity in this fraction could be monitored either as conjugated diene formation or reaction products (determined by HPLC) and was mainly associated with a heavy membrane fraction (HMF, enriched in tonoplast, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and ) and a light membrane fraction (LMF, enriched in plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, with low levels of tonoplast and ). The LOX activity of LMF from berries of both cultivations showed an optimum at pH 8.0. The HMF exhibited a different activity peak in samples from conventional (pH 8.0) and organic (pH 5.5) cultures, suggesting the presence of different isoenzymes. These findings were also confirmed by variation of the ratio of 9- and 13-hydroperoxides in organic (1:1) and conventional cultivations (1:10), indicating that the organic one was subjected to an oxidative stress in the coffee pulp fraction leading to the expression of an acidic LOX.

In each case, inactivation is time-dependent and not reversed by dilution or dialysis. Inactivation requires 13-hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoic acid (13-HPOD), which suggests that it is specific for the ferric form of the enzyme. Lipoxygenase catalyzes an oxygenation reaction on each of the aforementioned thiols, as judged by the consumption of O(2). These reactions also require 13-HPOD. 1-Octanethiol is converted to 1-octanesulfonic acid, which was identified by GC/MS of its methyl ester. The rates of oxygen uptake for R- and S-12-HODE are about 5- and 2.5-fold higher than the rate with 1-octanethiol. The stoichiometries of inactivation imply that inactivation occurs on approximately 1 in 18 turnovers for 12-HSODA, 1 in 48 turnovers for 1-octanethiol, 1 in 63 turnovers for S-12-HSODE, and 1 in 240 turnovers for R-12-HSODE. These data imply that close resemblance to lipoxygenase substrates is not a crucial requirement for either oxidation or inactivation. Under the conditions of our experiments, inactivation was not observed with several more polar thiols: mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, L-cysteine, glutathione, N-acetylcysteamine, and captopril.

The hydroperoxy fatty acids present in situ are converted by rapid thermal treatment (80 s and 210 J g-1) of the biological sample into ethane and n-pentane, which are analyzed by gas chromatography. The method has been directly calibrated by quantification of the hydroperoxy fatty acids by silica-phase HPLC analysis of their reduced hydroxy derivatives. Hypocotyl/radicles from the two soybean cultivars Argenta and Soriano were submitted to various chemical oxidative treatments and were analyzed for both thermally produced volatile alkanes and hydroperoxy fatty acid levels. Our results showed that ethane and n-pentane production are in both cases closely correlated with linolenic as well as linoleic acid hydroperoxide levels (P < 0.001). Within a given plant material, thermal conversion of both hydroperoxides into alkanes occurred with yields which were not dependent on the oxidative treatment. These yields are however functions of the biological material since in Soriano and Argenta cultivars they were around 6 and 25%, respectively. Taking into account the last point, the alkane test cannot be used to directly quantify the absolute  hydroperoxide levels of plant tissues but it is convenient to monitor the peroxidative phenomenon as it occurs.

The former of these hydroperoxides was generated at all pH values, but in the presence of Tween 20, the latter product did not form at pH values above 8.5. As the pH decreased below 8.5, the proportion of (9S)-hydroperoxide increased linearly until at pH 6 it constituted about 25% of the chiral products attributed to enzymic action. Below pH 6, lipoxygenase activity was barely measurable, and the hydroperoxide product arose mainly from autoxidation and possibly non-enzymic oxygenation of the pentadienyl radical formed by the enzyme. The change in percent enzymically formed 9-hydroperoxide between pH 6.0 and 8.5 paralleled the pH plot of a sodium linoleate/linoleic acid titration. It was concluded that the (9S)-hydroperoxide is formed only from the nonionized carboxylic acid form of linoleic acid. Methyl esterification of linoleic acid blocked the formation of the (9S)-hydroperoxide by lipoxygenase-1, but not the (13S)-hydroperoxide. Since the hydroperoxydiene moieties of the (9S)- and (13S)-hydroperoxides are spatially identical when the molecules are arranged head to tail in opposite orientations, it is suggested that the carboxylic acid form of the substrate can arrange itself at the active site in either orientation, but the carboxylate anion can be positioned only in one orientation.

Moreover, we found that peroxide-dependent activation of the lipoxygenase depended strongly on the oxygen concentration. These data can be described with a kinetic model that extends previous schemes of the lipoxygenase reaction in three essential aspects: (a) the product of 19-OH-AA oxygenation is a less effective lipoxygenase activator than (13S,9Z,11E)-13-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid; (b) molecular dioxygen serves not only as a lipoxygenase substrate, but also impacts peroxide-dependent enzyme activation; (c) there is a leakage of radical intermediates from the catalytic cycle, which leads to the formation of inactive ferrous lipoxygenase. This enzyme inactivation can be reversed by another round of peroxide-dependent activation.

A critical event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the vessel wall. Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) plays a pivotal role in this process by mediating leukocyte binding to endothelial cells. VCAM-1 expression is stimulated by oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids such as 13-hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid (), and this  hydroperoxide has been proposed to be a second messenger for induction of VCAM-1 gene expression. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) markedly represses cytokine-induced VCAM-1 gene expression in cultured human endothelial cells; however, its effects on the oxidative second messenger pathway are unknown. Using a lipoxygenase (LO) inhibition assay in tandem with a colorimetric assay for  peroxides, we determined that PDTC does not inhibit the enzymatic oxidation of linoleic acid to  by LO, but directly interacts with and chemically reduces . We hypothesize that dithiocarbamates may intercept the oxidative second-messenger-induced expression of VCAM-1 and other redox-regulated genes important in inflammation and atherosclerosis.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7944405>The role of  hydroperoxides in the myoglobin-dependent oxidation of LDL.</a></h2><p>It has previously been reported that mb in both the iron-oxo ferryl and the ferric oxidation states can promote  peroxidation and lead to oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein.

The oxidized lipids were also analyzed under conditions allowing preservation of their oxidation state. Using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of native and saponified  extracts of oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL), we found that the major fatty acid oxidation product was esterified hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (HPODE), the oxidized product of the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid in human LDL, linoleic acid. Although some esterified hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) was also detected, the reduction of HPODE to HODE did not appear to be monocyte-dependent. Essentially all of the HPODE was found to be esterified with the majority being esterified to cholesterol followed by phospholipids and generally following the abundance of esterified linoleic acid within the  classes. The percent of cholesteryl linoleate converted to cholesteryl HPODE and cholesteryl HODE at the end of the 24-h incubation was determined to be approximately 13.5%. The formation of oxidized esterified linoleic acid in the LDL was shown to require immunological activation of the human monocytes, a previously observed requirement for general LDL oxidation in this culture system. The oxidized esterified linoleic acid was present in the supernatant with the LDL and was not cell-associated. HPODE formation on LDL was prevented by including superoxide dismutase (SOD) or eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) during the 24-h coincubation of activated monocytes with LDL whereas indomethacin was without effect.

At least ten genes attributed to four novel CYP74 subfamilies have been revealed by the recent sequencing of the spikemoss Selaginella moellendorffii Hieron genome. Two of these genes CYP74M1 and CYP74M3 have been cloned in the present study. Both recombinant proteins CYP74M1 and CYP74M3 were active towards the 13(S)-hydroperoxides of α-linolenic and linoleic acids (13-HPOT and 13-HPOD, respectively) and exhibited the activity of divinyl ether synthase (DES). Products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Individual oxylipins were purified by HPLC and finally identified by their NMR data, including the (1)H NMR, 2D-COSY, HSQC and HMBC. CYP74M1 (SmDES1) specifically converted 13-HPOT to (11Z)-etherolenic acid and 13-HPOD to (11Z)-etheroleic acid.

It is initiated by free oxygen radical-induced abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the  molecule followed by a series of nonenzymatic reactions that ultimately generate the reactive aldehyde species 4-hydroxyalkenals. The molecule 4-hydroxy-2E-hexenal (4-HHE) is generated by peroxidation of n-3 PUFAs, such as linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. The aldehyde product 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (4-HNE) is the peroxidation product of n-6 PUFAs, such as arachidonic and linoleic acids and their 15-lipoxygenase metabolites, namely 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HpETE) and 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (). Another reactive peroxidation product is 4-hydroxy-2E,6Z-dodecadienal (4-HDDE), which is derived from 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HpETE), the 12-lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid. Hydroxyalkenals, notably 4-HNE, have been implicated in various pathophysiological interactions due to their chemical reactivity and the formation of covalent adducts with macromolecules. The progressive accumulation of these adducts alters normal cell functions that can lead to cell death. The lipophilicity of these aldehydes positively correlates to their chemical reactivity. Nonetheless, at low and noncytotoxic concentrations, these molecules may function as signaling molecules in cells. This has been shown mostly for 4-HNE and to some extent for 4-HHE. The capacity of 4-HDDE to generate such "mixed signals" in cells has received less attention.

Therefore, the metabolic fate of  (13-hydroperoxy octadecadienoic acid), 13-HODE (13-hydroxy octadecadienoic acid) and linoleic acid (LA) was investigated in a CaCo-2 cell monolayer as a model of the intestinal epithelium. [1-14C]-, up to a non-cytotoxic concentration of 100 microM, did not cross the CaCo-2 cell monolayer unreduced if applied to the luminal side. The [1 -14C]-HPODE-derived radioactivity was preferentially recovered from intracellular and released diacylglycerols (DG), phospholipids (PL) and cholesterol esterified with oxidized fatty acids (oxCE). A similar distribution pattern was obtained with 13-HODE. In contrast, LA is preferentially incorporated into triacylglycerols (TG), cholesteryl esters (CE) and PL (but mainly released as TG).  dose-dependently decreased the incorporation of LA into released TG, while LA accumulated in cellular and released DGs, effects similarily exerted by 13-HODE.

The structures and stereochemical configurations of these oxylipins were determined by chemical and spectral methods using the authentic compounds as references. Incubations performed in the presence of glutathione peroxidase revealed that lipoxygenase activity of potato leaves generated the 9- and 13-hydroperoxides of linoleic acid in a ratio of 95:5. Separate incubations of these hydroperoxides showed that linoleic acid 9(S)-hydroperoxide was metabolized into epoxy alcohols by particle-bound epoxy alcohol synthase activity, whereas the 13-hydroperoxide was metabolized into alpha- and gamma-ketols by a particle-bound allene oxide synthase. It was concluded that the main pathway of linoleic acid  in potato leaves involved 9-lipoxygenase-catalyzed oxygenation into linoleic acid 9(S)-hydroperoxide followed by rapid conversion of this hydroperoxide into epoxy alcohols and a slower, epoxide hydrolase-catalyzed conversion of the epoxy alcohols into trihydroxy-octadecenoates.

Because LDL oxidative modification may vary within atherosclerotic lesions, we examined the effects of defined, oxidatively modified LDL species on human arterial smooth muscle cell apoptosis and the cytoprotective effects of vitamin C. Moderately oxidized LDL (0 to 300 microg protein/mL), which has the highest content of  hydroperoxides, induced smooth muscle cell apoptosis within 6 hours, whereas native LDL and mildly and highly oxidized LDL had no effect. Moderately oxidized LDL increased cellular DNA fragmentation, release of fragmented DNA into the culture medium, and annexin V binding and decreased mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and expression of the antiapoptotic mediator Bcl-x(L). Treatment of cells with native LDL together with the  hydroperoxide 13(S)-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9Z,11E-dienoic acid (HPODE, 200 micromol/L, 6 to 24 hours) also induced apoptotic cell death.

Concomitant with the production of this radical there is a decrease in the intensity of an EPR signal corresponding to enzyme-bound Fe3+ and characteristic of the purple species. Taken together, these observations support the suggestion that the purple species is a complex between ferric lipoxygenase and 13-HPOD, likely the ferric peroxide.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20131800>Proteins modified by the  peroxidation aldehyde 9,12-dioxo-10(E)-dodecenoic acid in MCF7 breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>The hydroperoxide of linoleic acid () degrades to 9,12-dioxo-10(E)-dodecenoic acid (DODE), which readily modifies proteins.

Identification of the membrane-bound 12-HETE-forming activity as a 12-lipoxygenase included 12S-stereospecificity of product formation and trapping of 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid as a reaction product. The 12-lipoxygenase activity was extracted from cell membranes only with detergent (1% Triton X-100), and the activity (membrane-bound or detergent-solubilized) was completely inactivated by mixing with the cytosol-containing subcellular fraction. The inhibitory effect of the cytosolic fraction was reversed by treating the cytosol with GSH-depleting agents (2-cyclohexene-1-one or N-ethylmaleimide) or by mixing it with  hydroperoxide (13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid) at a concentration that had little direct effect on enzyme activity. Inhibition of 12-lipoxygenase activity could also be achieved by treatment of enzyme preparations with GSH at levels (0.1-10 mM) found in epithelial cell cytosol. In addition, treatment of cultured epithelial cells with a GSH-depleting agent (buthionine sulfoximine) and  hydroperoxide restored cellular 12-lipoxygenase activity. Little or no detectable 12-lipoxygenase activity was found in freshly isolated ovine tracheal epithelial cells, but the cytosolic 12-lipoxygenase found in freshly isolated bovine tracheal epithelial cells was relatively insensitive to regulation by GSH or  hydroperoxide.

To confirm the role of NF-kappa B in -induced MCP-1 expression and to selectively block the induction of such inflammatory genes in VSMC, we designed novel molecular approaches to knockdown NF-kappa B with short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). We designed siRNAs to human NF-kappa B p65 transcriptionally active subunit by using a rapid PCR-based approach that generates sense and antisense siRNA separated by a hairpin loop downstream of the U6 promoter. siRNA PCR products targeting seven different sites on p65 cDNA could induce upto 92% reduction in HA-p65 protein levels.

These concentrations were comparable to those of the enzymes. Soybean lipoxygenase-1 (EC 1.13.11.33, plant enzyme) was not inhibited, whereas prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1 (EC 1.14.99.1) was inhibited only at much higher concentrations of ebselen (IC50 = 37.7 +/- 4.3 microM). The action of ebselen on reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase (IC50 = 0.17 +/- 0.01 microM) was studied in detail. Inhibition occurred instantaneously and appeared to be reversible and was largely abolished by a 20-fold molar excess of GSH over ebselen. In the presence of 1 mM GSH 50% inhibition was observed only at ebselen concentrations as high as 234 +/- 27 microM. 13S-hydroperoxy-9Z, 11E-octadecadienoic acid, the lipoxygenase product formed from linoleic acid, augmented the inhibitory effect at low concentrations and caused a partial reversal at high concentrations. A variety of derivatives or structural analogues of ebselen were also tested and proved to be either inactive or weaker inhibitors of 15-lipoxygenase. We have concluded that the potent inhibition of 15-lipoxygenase by ebselen is due neither to GSH peroxidase-like activity nor to lowering of the hydroperoxide tone.

The oxidation of GSH was dependent on the concentration of linoleic acid (LA), GSH, and the enzyme. The optimal conditions to observe maximal enzyme velocity included the presence of 0.42 mM LA, 2 mM GSH, and 50 pmole of enzyme/mL. The GSH oxidation was linear up to 10 minutes and exhibited a pH optimum of 9.0. The reaction displayed a Km of 1.49 mM for GSH and Vmax of 1.35 +/- 0.02 mumoles/min/nmole of enzyme. Besides LA, arachidonic and gamma-linolenic acids also supported the lipoxygenase-mediated GSH oxidation. Hydrogen peroxide and 13-hydroperoxylinoleic acid supported GSH cooxidation, but to a very limited extent. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was identified as the major product of the reaction based on the depletion of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide 3'-phosphate (NADPH) in the presence of glutathione reductase. The GSH oxidation was accompanied by the reduction of ferricytochrome c, which can be completely abolished by superoxide dismutase (SOD), suggesting the generation of superoxide anion radicals. Under optimal conditions, the rate of superoxide generation (measured as the SOD-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c) was 10 +/- 1.0 nmole/min/nmole of enzyme.

Rice leaf pathogen-inducible lipoxygenase, but not soybean lipoxygenase-1 (sLO-1), generated a low level of 11-HPODE (0.4%) besides its main hydroperoxide, 13(S)-HPODE, on incubation with LA. Steric analysis revealed that 11-HPODE was enriched with respect to the R enantiomer [74% 11(R)]. In agreement with previous results, 11 (S)-HPODE incubated with Mn-LO provided 13(R)-HPODE, and the same conversion also took place with the methyl ester of 11(S)-HPODE. 11(R,S)-HPODE was metabolized biphasically in the presence of Mn-LO, i.e., by a rapid phase during which the 11(S)-enantiomer was converted into 13(R)-HPODE and a slow phase during which the 11(R)-enantiomer was converted into 9(R)-HPODE. sLO-1 catalyzed a slow conversion of 11 (S)-HPODE into a mixture of 13(R)-HPODE (75%), 9(S)-HPODE (10%), and 13(S)-HPODE (10%), whereas 11(R,S)-HPODE produced a mixture of nearly racemic  (approximately 70%) and 9-HPODE (approximately 30%).

By complementary applications of ESR spin-trapping, HPLC/high resolution mass spectrometric and other analytical methods, we found that 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) could significantly enhance the decomposition of a model ROOH tert-butylhydroperoxide, resulting in the formation of t-butoxyl radicals independent of transition metals.

Because enzymatic oxidation progresses concurrently with auto-oxidation, we need to distinguish them further. Here, we attempted such an analysis. First, we used lipoxygenase, linoleic acid, and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to synthesize the enzymatic oxidation product 13(S)-9Z,11E-HPODE PC, and the auto-oxidation products 13(RS)-9Z,11E-HPODE PC and 13(RS)-9E,11E-HPODE PC, which were used as standards to test the ability of various columns to separate the enzymatic oxidation product from auto-oxidation products. Separation was achieved by connecting in series two columns with different properties: CHIRALPAK OP (+) and CHIRALPAK IB-3. The CHIRALPAK OP (+) column separated 13(R)-9Z,11E-HPODE PC and 13(S)-9Z,11E-HPODE PC, whereas CHIRALPAK IB-3 enabled separation of 13(S)-9Z,11E-HPODE PC and 13(RS)-9E,11E-HPODE PC. The results for the analysis of both enzymatically oxidized and auto-oxidized lecithin (an important phospholipid mixture in vivo and in food) indicate that our method would be useful for distinguishing enzymatic oxidation and auto-oxidation reactions.

In the present study, the effect of oxidative stress on the nuclear translocation of GSTpi and its role in the protection of DNA from damage were investigated. In human colonic cancer HCT8 cells, the hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced increase in nuclear condensation, the population of sub-G(1) peak, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells were observed in cells pretreated with edible mushroom lectin, an inhibitor of the nuclear transport of GSTpi. The DNA damage and the formation of  peroxide were dependent on the dose of H(2)O(2) and the incubation time. Immunological analysis showed that H(2)O(2) induced the nuclear accumulation of GSTpi but not of glutathione peroxidase. Formation of the 7-(2-oxo-hepyl)-substituted 1,N(2)-etheno-2'-deoxyguanosine adduct by the reaction of 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid () with 2'-deoxyguanosine was inhibited by GSTpi in the presence of glutathione.

This differential response was attributed to differences in the rate of EGF receptor (EGFR) dephosphorylation. To further define the molecular basis for these observations, in this report we examine the interaction of phosphorylated EGFR with the SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, a positive modulator of EGF dependent cell growth. SHP-2 associated with phosphorylated EGFR to a greater extent in supB+ cells when compared to supB-. This differential association could not be accounted for by differences between suppressor gene phenotypes in SHP-2 protein level or mutations in the molecular sequence. The addition of 13(S)-HpODE stimulated a concentration-dependent increase in EGF-dependent phosphorylation of SHP-2 and its association with EGFR. A more dramatic response was observed in the supB+ cells. Differences in SHP-2 interaction with EGFR may account, in part, for phenotypic differences in the growth rates and responsiveness to EGF between the supB+ and supB- cells.

However, it has not yet been described for the bioactivation of BaP-7,8-diol. In this report, we demonstrate that CYP2S1 can use various fatty acid hydroperoxides to support epoxidation of BaP-7,8-diol at a much higher rate than with cumene hydroperoxide. Kinetic analyses with several fatty acid hydroperoxides revealed that 13S-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid () was the most potent oxidant tested (K(m), 3.4 +/- 0.8 microM; turnover, 4.51 +/- 0.13 min(-1)), followed by 12S-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (K(m), 2.8 +/- 0.7 microM; turnover, 3.7 +/- 0.1 min(-1)), 5S-hydroperoxy-6E,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (K(m), 2.7 +/- 0.8 microM; turnover, 3.69 +/- 0.09 min(-1)), and 15S-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (K(m), 11.6 +/- 0.3 microM; turnover, 0.578 +/- 0.030 min(-1)). The antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole inhibited CYP2S1-catalyzed epoxidation by 100%, suggesting that epoxidation proceeds by a free radical mechanism. Other cytochromes P450, including CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4, were also able to epoxidize BaP-7,8-diol using various fatty acid hydroperoxides, although at slower rates than CYP2S1. The cytotoxicity of BaP-7,8-diol significantly increased in mammalian cells overexpressing CYP2S1, and BaP-diol-t-epoxide formation in these cells also increased in the presence of . Together, these results suggest that fatty acid hydroperoxides can serve as physiological cofactors in supporting in vivo CYP2S1-catalyzed oxidation of BaP-7,8-diol, and that fatty acid hydroperoxides and CYP2S1 may play important roles in benzo[a]pyrene-induced carcinogenesis.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8593330>[Effect of 13(S)-HPODE, a lipoxygenase product of linoleic acid, on calcium transport and Na,K-ATPase activity in the myocardial sarcolemma].</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8305492>Stimulation of lipoxin synthesis from leukotriene A4 by endogenously formed 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid in activated human platelets.</a></h2><p>Human platelets are devoid of 5-lipoxygenase activity but convert exogenous leukotriene A4 (LTA4) either by a specific LTC4 synthase to leukotriene C4 or via a 12-lipoxygenase mediated reaction to lipoxins.

Platelet activation with thrombin, collagen or ionophore A23187 increased the conversion of LTA4 to lipoxins and decreased the leukotriene production. Maximal effects were observed after incubation with ionophore A23187, which induced synthesis of comparable amounts of lipoxins and cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4).

However, calcium did not affect the 12-lipoxygenase activity in the 100,000 x g supernatant of sonicated platelet suspensions.

Previous studies suggested that accumulation of linoleic acid (LA) oxygenation products derived from 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) metabolism could regulate vascular functions. The initial LA derivative from the 15-LOX-1 pathway, 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (HPODE), can induce endothelial death, whereas the reduced hydroxyl product, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), is abundantly produced during vascular activation.

This alteration of regiospecificity is not an isolated phenomenon, since it occurs during a reaction carried out under "classical" conditions, i.e. in a buffer saturated with air before the reaction. beta-carotene bleaching and electronic paramagnetic resonance findings provided evidence that substrate-derived free radical species are released from the enzyme.

We expected that an ester of 2-lysophosphatidylcoline (PC), OETA-PC, would be produced by oxidative cleavage of 9-HPODE-PC in biological membranes. An efficient, unambiguous total synthesis of trans-OETA-PC was first executed to provide a standard that could facilitate the identification of this phospholipid epoxyalkenal that was shown to be produced during oxidation of the linoleic acid ester of 2-lysoPC. Finally, trans-OETA-PC was detected in a  extract from rat retina. The identity of the naturally occurring oxidatively truncated phospholipid was further confirmed by derivatization with methoxylamine that produced characteristic mono and bis adducts. The average amount of trans-OETA-PC in rat retina, 0.33 pmol, is relatively low as compared to other oxidatively truncated PCs, for example, the 4-hydroxy-7-oxohept-5-enoic acid PC ester (2.5 pmol) or the 4-keto-7-oxohept-5-enoic acid PC ester (1.7 pmol), derived from the docosahexaenoic acid ester of 2-lysoPC. This, most likely, is because docosahexaenoate PCs are particularly abundant in the retina as compared to the linoleate PC ester precursor of OETA-PC.

This has led to the proposal that dietary supplementation with antioxidants such as vitamin C (vit C) may be useful in disease prevention. However, vit C has proved to be ineffective in cancer chemoprevention studies. In addition, concerns have been raised over potentially deleterious transition metal ion-mediated pro-oxidant effects. We have now determined that vit C induces  hydroperoxide decomposition to the DNA-reactive bifunctional electrophiles 4-oxo-2-nonenal, 4,5-epoxy-2(E)-decenal, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. The compound 4,5-Epoxy-2(E)-decenal is a precursor of etheno-2'-deoxyadenosine, a highly mutagenic lesion found in human DNA. Vitamin C-mediated formation of genotoxins from  hydroperoxides in the absence of transition metal ions could help explain its lack of efficacy as a cancer chemoprevention agent.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20736172>Identification of a  peroxidation product as the source of oxidation-specific epitopes recognized by anti-DNA autoantibodies.</a></h2><p> peroxidation in tissue and in tissue fractions represents a degradative process, which is the consequence of the production and the propagation of free radical reactions primarily involving membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We have found that bovine serum albumin incubated with peroxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly cross-reacted with the sera from MRL-lpr mice, a representative murine model of SLE. To identify the active substances responsible for the generation of autoantigenic epitopes recognized by the SLE sera, we performed the activity-guiding separation of a principal source from 13-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid and identified 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE), a highly reactive aldehyde originating from the peroxidation of ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, as the source of the autoantigenic epitopes. When the age-dependent change in the antibody titer against the ONE-modified protein was measured in the sera from MRL-lpr mice and control MRL-MpJ mice, all of the MRL-lpr mice developed an anti-ONE titer, which was comparable with the anti-DNA titer. Strikingly, a subset of the anti-DNA monoclonal antibodies generated from the SLE mice showing recognition specificity toward DNA cross-reacted with the ONE-specific epitopes. Furthermore, these dual-specific antibodies rapidly bound and internalized into living cells. These findings raised the possibility that the enhanced  peroxidation followed by the generation of ONE may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1905562>Formation of ketodienoic fatty acids by the pure pea lipoxygenase-1.</a></h2><p>A pure lipoxygenase from dried green pea seeds (isoenzyme 1) oxygenates linoleic acid to 9(S/R)-hydroperoxy-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (9-HPODE) and 13(S/R)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid ().

The role of nutrient-induced biosynthesis of hormones is paramount for attaining metabolic homeostasis in the organism. Nutrient overload attenuate key metabolic cellular functions and interfere with hormonal-regulated inter- and intra-organ communication, which may ultimately lead to metabolic derangements. Hyperglycemia and high levels of saturated free fatty acids induce excessive production of  free radicals in tissues and cells. This phenomenon, which is accentuated in both type-1 and type-2 diabetic patients, has been associated with the development of impaired glucose tolerance and the etiology of peripheral complications. However, low levels of the same free radicals also induce hormetic responses that protect cells against deleterious effects of the same radicals. Of interest is the role of hydroxyl radicals in initiating peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and generation of α,β-unsaturated reactive 4-hydroxyalkenals that avidly form covalent adducts with nucleophilic moieties in proteins, phospholipids and nucleic acids. Numerous studies have linked the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (4-HNE) to different pathological and cytotoxic processes. Similarly, two other members of the family, 4-hydroxyl-2E-hexenal (4-HHE) and 4-hydroxy-2E,6Z-dodecadienal (4-HDDE), have also been identified as potential cytotoxic agents. It has been suggested that 4-HNE-induced modifications in macromolecules in cells may alter their cellular functions and modify signaling properties. Yet, it has also been acknowledged that these bioactive aldehydes also function as signaling molecules that directly modify cell functions in a hormetic fashion to enable cells adapt to various stressful stimuli. Recent studies have shown that 4-HNE and 4-HDDE, which activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) in vascular endothelial cells and insulin secreting beta cells, promote such adaptive responses to ameliorate detrimental effects of high glucose and diabetes-like conditions. In addition, due to the electrophilic nature of these reactive aldehydes they form covalent adducts with electronegative moieties in proteins, phosphatidylethanolamine and nucleotides. Normally these non-enzymatic modifications are maintained below the cytotoxic range due to efficient cellular neutralization processes of 4-hydroxyalkenals. The major neutralizing enzymes include fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), aldose reductase (AR) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which transform the aldehyde to the corresponding carboxylic acid or alcohols, respectively, or by biding to the thiol group in glutathione (GSH) by the action of glutathione-S-transferase (GST). This review describes the hormetic and cytotoxic roles of  free radicals and 4-hydroxyalkenals in beta cells exposed to nutritional challenges and the cellular mechanisms they employ to maintain their level at functional range below the cytotoxic threshold.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It may proceed either via the direct action of a triacylglycerol lipase, or in certain plant species via a specific  body 13-lipoxygenase. For the involvement of a lipoxygenase previous results suggested that the hydroxy- or oxo-group that is being introduced into the fatty acid backbone by this lipoxygenase forms a barrier to continuous β-oxidation.This study shows however that a complete degradation of oxygenated fatty acids is possible by isolated cucumber and sunflower glyoxysomes. Interestingly, degradation is accompanied by the formation of saturated short chain acyl-CoAs with chain length between 4 and 12 carbon atoms lacking the hydroxy- or oxo-diene system of the oxygenated fatty acid substrate. The presence of these CoA esters suggests the involvement of a specific reduction of the diene system at a chain length of 12 carbon atoms including conversion of the hydroxy-group at C7.To our knowledge this metabolic pathway has not been described for the degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids so far. It may represent a new principle to degrade oxygenated fatty acid derivatives formed by lipoxygenases or chemical oxidation initiated by reactive oxygen species.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12893830>The C2-like beta-barrel domain mediates the Ca2+-dependent resistance of 5-lipoxygenase activity against inhibition by glutathione peroxidase-1.</a></h2><p>Recently, we reported that in crude enzyme preparations, a monocyte-derived soluble protein (M-DSP) renders 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) activity Ca2+-dependent. Here we provide evidence that this M-DSP is glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-1. Thus, the inhibitory effect of the M-DSP on 5-LO could be overcome by the GPx-1 inhibitor mercaptosuccinate and by the broad spectrum GPx inhibitor iodoacetate, as well as by addition of 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13(S)-HPODE). Also, the chromatographic characteristics and the estimated molecular mass (80-100 kDa) of the M-DSP fit to GPx-1 (87 kDa), and GPx-1, isolated from bovine erythrocytes, mimicked the effects of the M-DSP. Intriguingly, only a trace amount of thiol (10 micro M GSH) was required for reduction of 5-LO activity by GPx-1 or the M-DSP. Moreover, the requirement of Ca2+ allowing 5-LO product synthesis in various leukocytes correlated with the respective GPx-1 activities. Mutation of the Ca2+ binding sites within the C2-like domain of 5-LO resulted in strong reduction of 5-LO activity by M-DSP and GPx-1, also in the presence of Ca2+. In summary, our data suggest that interaction of Ca2+ at the C2-like domain of 5-LO protects the enzyme against the effect of GPx-1. Apparently, in the presence of Ca2+, a low  hydroperoxide level is sufficient for 5-LO activation.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16603467>Activation of AP-1 and increased synthesis of MMP-9 in the rabbit retina induced by  hydroperoxide.</a></h2><p>We identified the temporal expression of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) after linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LHP) induction of retinal neovascularization.After injection of LHP into the vitreous of rabbits, samples were collected for AP-1 binding activity and mRNA for MMP-9 and MMPs activity.

Likewise, the substitution of Ala for Cys residue at position 12 increased antioxidant action against Cu2+ oxidation of LDL. Additionally, the Cys substitution contributed to enhanced capabilities in the removal of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid. Furthermore, the combined incorporation of His and Cys residues enhanced antioxidant actions in preventing Cu2+ oxidation and reducing HOCl and hydroperoxide levels.

Although a broad diversity of oxylipins is known in the algae, no CYP74s or related enzymes have been detected in brown algae yet. Cloning of the first CYP74-related gene CYP5164B1 of brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus is reported in present work. The recombinant protein was incubated with several fatty acid hydroperoxides. Linoleic acid 9-hydroperoxide (9-HPOD) was the preferred substrate, while linoleate 13-hydroperoxide (13-HPOD) was less efficient. α-Linolenic acid 9- and 13-hydroperoxides, as well as eicosapentaenoic acid 15-hydroperoxide were inefficient substrates. Both 9-HPOD and 13-HPOD were converted into epoxyalcohols. For instance, 9-HPOD was turned primarily into (9S,10S,11S,12Z)-9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid. Both epoxide and hydroxyl  atoms of the epoxyalcohol were incorporated mostly from [O]9-HPOD. Thus, the enzyme exhibits the activity of epoxyalcohol synthase (EsEAS).

Oxygen labeling studies indicate that the observed products arise by at least two pathways. In the major pathway, hematin reduces  by one electron to an alkoxyl radical that cyclizes to an adjacent double bond to form an epoxy allylic radical. The allylic radical either couples to the hydroxyl radical coordinated to hematin or diffuses from the solvent cage and couples to O2, forming a peroxyl radical. In the minor pathway, the hydroperoxide is oxidized by one electron to a 13-peroxyl radical that undergoes beta-scission to a pentadienyl radical and O2. Exchange of hydroperoxide-derived O2 for dissolved O2 occurs at this stage followed by coupling of O2 to either terminus of the pentadienyl radical. Both pathways of hydroperoxide  generate significant quantities of peroxyl radicals that epoxidize the isolated double bonds of dihydroaromatic molecules. The products of hydroperoxide reaction with hematin and the oxygen labeling patterns are very similar to the products of unsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxide  by platelets, aorta, and lung.

When lipoxygenase is mixed with an equimolar concentration of 13-HPOD, the enzyme undergoes a rapid change in fluorescence. The rate of the change of fluorescence is dependent on the concentration of the 13-HPOD (k = 6.7 x 10(6) M-1 s-1) and is accompanied by activation of the enzyme. The fluorescence change is not accompanied by any change in the UV absorbance of the 13-HPOD, suggesting no loss of the conjugated diene during enzyme activation, and HPLC analysis of the products of the reaction confirms that the 13-HPOD can be recovered unchanged following this reaction. In the presence of an inhibitor (BWA4C, a hydroxamate inhibitor) that reduces the active-site iron, the 13-HPOD and the inhibitor are destroyed in a peroxidase-like reaction.

To determine the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for an adaptive response induced by LPS, we studied the changes in the antioxidant system. LPS treatment resulted in an increase in the gene expression of glutathione S-transferase A3 (GST-A3) by up to 60-fold as well as in GST enzyme activity.

The stoichiometry of the reaction and similar results with alpha-methylbenzyl, benzyl, and t-butyl hydroperoxides are in accord with the following general equation, in which X represents an alkyl group and R and R' are either alkyl groups or hydrogen atoms in the starting peroxide: XRR'C-OOH + NADPH + H+----XRCO + R'H + H2O + NADP+. Because  yields pentane under these conditions, we propose that the known formation of alkanes and aldehydes in membrane  peroxidation involves reductive cleavage by P-450 to give the products predicted by the above equation. The cleavage reaction is thought to involve stepwise one-electron transfer, resulting in homolysis of the peroxide oxygen-oxygen bond and generation of an alkoxy radical, with beta-scission of the latter followed by reduction of the secondary radical to the hydrocarbon. In accordance with this scheme, when the cleavage reaction with cumyl hydroperoxide was done in 2H2O, deuteromethane was formed.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25447492>Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry determination of human plasma 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoyl-phosphatidylcholine isomers via promotion of sodium adduct formation.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH), a primary oxidation product of phosphatidylcholine, in blood plasma has been observed in various pathological conditions, including atherosclerosis. In this study, we investigated the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to develop a method for accurate quantification of PCOOH (1-palmitoyl-2-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 16:0/HpODE PC), focusing on isomers such as 16:0/ PC and 16:0/9-HpODE PC. Sodiated PCOOH ([M+Na](+), m/z 812) provided not only a known product ion (m/z 147) but also characteristic product ions (m/z 541 for 16:0/ PC and m/z 388 for 16:0/9-HpODE PC). Thus, three multiple reaction monitorings (MRMs) could be performed. MRM (812/147) enabled determination of 16:0/HpODE PC, and MRM (812/541) and MRM (812/388) allowed specific measurement of 16:0/ PC and 16:0/9-HpODE PC, respectively. By using this method, we could determine plasma PCOOH concentrations in healthy subjects and patients with angiographically significant stenosis. In healthy subject and patient plasma, the concentration of 16:0/HpODE PC was close to the sum of the concentrations of 16:0/ PC and 16:0/9-HpODE PC. This finding shows that radical and/or enzymatic oxidation, rather than singlet  oxidation, is recognized to cause peroxidation of PC. The newly developed LC-MS/MS method appears to be a powerful tool for developing a better understanding of in vivo lipid peroxidation and its involvement in human diseases.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Thereby fatty acid hydroperoxide represent a common intermediate, also in human innate immune cells, like neutrophil granulocytes. In these cells a further key component is the heme protein myeloperoxidase producing HOCl as a reactive oxidant. On the basis of different investigation a reaction of the fatty acid hydroperoxide and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) could be assumed. Here, chromatographic and spectrometric analysis revealed that the hydroperoxide moiety of 15S-​hydroperoxy-​5Z,​8Z,​11Z,​13E-​eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HpETE) and 13S-​hydroperoxy-​9Z,​11E-​octadecadienoic acid () is not affected by HOCl. No reduction of the hydroperoxide group due to a reaction with HOCl could be measured. It could be demonstrated that the double bonds of the fatty acid hydroperoxides are the major target of HOCl, present either as reagent or formed by the myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-chloride system.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The conversion from the Fe3+ enzyme form to the Fe2+ form can be achieved using reducing inhibitors, a reaction that can be reversed with  hydroperoxides. The present study describes the properties of N-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-hydroxy-N'-(3-chlorophenyl)urea (CPHU), which functions as a reducing agent for various lipoxygenases and stimulates the degradation of  hydroperoxide catalyzed by these enzymes (pseudoperoxidase activity). CPHU was a substrate for the pseudoperoxidase reaction of purified soybean lipoxygenase-1 with apparent Km values for CPHU and  () of 14 and 15 microM, respectively. CPHU was converted during the pseudoperoxidase reaction to a mixture of products that can be resolved by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. By comparison with the chemical reaction of CPHU and potassium nitrosodisulfonate, the major enzymatic reaction product was tentatively identified as a one-electron oxidation product of CPHU. At low concentrations (50 microM), dithiothreitol completely protected against the degradation of hydroxyurea without inhibiting the pseudoperoxidase reaction. Under these conditions, the rate of the pseudoperoxidase reaction with CPHU as a substrate can be quantitated by the change in absorbance at 234 nm owing to the consumption of . In addition to soybean lipoxygenase-1, CPHU was found to be a substrate for the pseudoperoxidase activities of purified recombinant human 5-lipoxygenase and porcine leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase.

To elucidate the oxidative process, linoleic acid and 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid [13(S)-HPODE] were reacted with MnPs from Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and Bjerkandera adusta and the free radicals produced were analyzed by ESR. When the MnPs were reacted with 13(S)-HPODE in the presence of Mn(II), H2O2 and tert-nitrosobutane (t-NB), the ESR spectrum contained a sharp triplet of acyl radical (aN = 0.81 mT). Formation of acyl radical was also observed in the reactions of Mn(III)-tartrate with 13(S)-HPODE and with linoleic acid, but the latter reaction occurred explosively after an induction period of around 30 min. Reactions of MnP with linoleic acid in the presence of Mn(II), H2O2 and t-NB gave no spin adducts while addition of t-NB after preincubation of linoleic acid with MnP/Mn(II)/H2O2 for 2 h gave spin adducts of carbon-centered (aN = 1.53 mT, aH = 0.21 mT) and acyl (aN = 0.81 mT) radicals. In contrast to linoleic acid, methyl linoleate and oleic acid were not peroxidized by MnP and chelated Mn(III) within a few hours, indicating that structures containing both the 1,4-pentadienyl moiety and a free carboxyl group are necessary for inducing the peroxidation in a short reaction time. These results indicate that MnP-dependent  peroxidation is not initiated by direct abstraction of hydrogen from the bis-allylic position during turnover but proceeds by a Mn(III)-dependent hydrogen abstraction from enols and subsequent propagation reactions involving the formation of acyl radical from  hydroperoxide. This finding expands the role of chelated Mn(III) from a phenol oxidant to a strong generator of free radicals from lipids and  hydroperoxides in lignin biodegradation.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8375395>A glutathione S-transferase with glutathione-peroxidase activity from Arabidopsis thaliana.

Substantial amounts of [N-(EDE-H2O)]-Ang II isomers were also formed and their synthetic pathway might involve the tautomerization of a carbinolamine intermediate, followed by intramolecular cyclization and dehydration. The main HPNE-derived products were [His(6)(HPNE)]-Ang II and [N-(HPNE-H2O)]-Ang II.

Produced aldehydic compounds were trapped by addition of pentafluorobenzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (PFBHA-HCl), trimethylsilylated and finally identified by gas chromatography/mass spectronetry (GC/MS). Oxidation of ascorbic acid with O2 in presence of iron ions produced not only glycolaldehyde (GLA), but also glyceraldehyde (GA), dihydroxyacetone (DA) and formaldehyde.

The initial oxidation products are hydroperoxy fatty acids that are converted spontaneously or enzymatically to a variety of products. Hydroperoxy derivatives of oleic, linoleic, or arachidonic acids stimulate the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) purified from rat brain. The hydroperoxy acids satisfy the requirement of PKC for phospholipid (e.g., phosphatidylserine). Activation is observed in the presence or absence of 1 mM Ca2+. Reduction of the hydroperoxides to alcohols or dehydration of the hydroperoxides to ketones increases the Ka for activation three- to fourfold but does not significantly reduce the maximal extent of PKC activation. The Ka's for activation by hydroperoxy acids are approximately half the values exhibited by the unoxidized fatty acids. Since oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids to hydroperoxides is the first event in  peroxidation, activation of PKC by hydroperoxy fatty acids may be an early cellular response to oxidative stress.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9235921>The linoleic acid metabolite, (13S)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid, augments the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway by attenuation of receptor dephosphorylation. Differential response in Syrian hamster embryo tumor suppressor phenotypes.</a></h2><p>In Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) fibroblasts, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activity regulates the  of endogenous linoleic acid to (13S)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (13S)-HPODE). (13S)-HPODE stimulates EGF-dependent mitogenesis in a SHE cell phenotype, which expresses tumor suppressor genes (supB+), but was not effective in a variant that does not express these suppressor genes (supB-). In the present study, we have investigated the potential effects of this  metabolite on the EGFR signaling pathways in these two SHE cell lines. Treatment of quiescent SHE cells with EGF produced a rapid, transient increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR. Dependence on EGF concentration for EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was similar in both SHE cell lines, but a more prolonged phosphorylation was detected in the supB- variant. Incubation of supB+ cells with (13S)-HPODE and EGF increased EGFR autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation on several signaling proteins with Src homology-2 domains including GTPase-activating protein. The  metabolite did not significantly alter EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in the supB- variant. Tyrosine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase was also measured. The addition of (13S)-HPODE increased the extent and duration of MAP kinase tyrosine phosphorylation in supB+ cells but not in the supB- variant. MAP kinase activity in supB+ cells, as measured in immunoprecipitates from cells after the addition of EGF, was increased by the presence of (13S)-HPODE. The addition of (13S)-HPODE did not directly alter EGFR kinase activity or the internalization of the EGFR. However, the addition of (13S)-HPODE to supB+ cells extended the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR in response to EGF. The dephosphorylation of the EGFR was measured directly, and a slower rate was observed in the supB- compared with the supB+ cells. Incubation of the supB+ cells with (13S)-HPODE attenuated the dephosphorylation of the EGFR. Thus, (13S)-HPODE stimulates EGF-dependent mitogenesis and up-regulation of EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation by inhibiting the dephosphorylation of the EGFR. This study shows that a metabolite of an essential dietary fatty acid, linoleic acid, can modulate tyrosine phosphorylation and activity of key signal transduction proteins in a growth factor mitogenic pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16459928>Synthesis of dihydroperoxides of linoleic and linolenic acids and studies on their transformation to 4-hydroperoxynonenal.</a></h2><p>The cytotoxic aldehydes 4-hydroxynonenal, 4-hydroperoxynonenal (4-HPNE), and 4-oxononenal are formed during  peroxidation via oxidative transformation of the hydroxy or hydroperoxy precursor fatty acids, respectively.

Here, we synthesized diastereomeric 9,12-, 10,12-, and 10,13-diHPODE using singlet oxidation of linoleic acid. 8,13-Dihydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid was synthesized by vitamin E-controlled autoxidation of gamma-linolenic acid followed by reaction with soybean lipoxygenase. The transformation of these potential precursors to 4-HPNE was studied under conditions of autoxidation, hematin-, and acid-catalysis. In contrast to 9- or , neither of the dihydroperoxides formed 4-HPNE on autoxidation ( film, 37 degrees C), regardless of whether the free acid or the methyl ester derivative was used. Acid treatment of 10,13-diHPODE led to the expected formation of 4-HPNE as a significant product, in accord with a Hock-type cleavage reaction. We conclude that, although the suppression of 4-H(P)NE formation from monohydroperoxides by alpha-tocopherol indicates peroxyl radical reactions in the major route of carbon chain cleavage, the dihydroperoxides previously implicated are not intermediates in the autoxidative transformation of monohydroperoxy fatty acids to 4-HPNE and related aldehydes.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8690066>Divinyl ether synthase from garlic (Allium sativum L.) bulbs: sub-cellular localization and substrate regio-and stereospecificity.</a></h2><p>Sub-cellular localization and some properties of 13-hydroperoxide-specific divinyl ether synthase from garlic bulbs were studied.

For this purpose,  bodies were isolated from etiolated sunflower cotyledons at different stages of germination, and the storage triacylglycerols were analyzed for oxygenated derivatives. During the time course of germination the amount of oxygenated storage lipids was strongly augmented, and we detected triacylglycerols containing one, two or three residues of (9Z,11E,13S)-13-hydro(pero)xy-octadeca-9,11-dienoic acid.

Both oxygenated fatty acid derivatives were activated to the corresponding CoA esters and subsequently metabolized to compounds of shorter chain length. Cofactor requirement and formation of acetyl-CoA indicate degradation via beta-oxidation. However, beta-oxidation only proceeded for two consecutive cycles, leading to accumulation of a medium-chain metabolite carrying an oxo group at C-9, equivalent to C-13 of the parent (9Z,11E,13S)-13-hydroxy-octadeca-9,11-dienoic acid.

In particular, fatty acid derivatives of the plant lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway are implicated in the Aspergillus spp.-seed interaction. The 9(S)-hydroperoxide derivative of linoleic acid promotes transcription of AF genes, whereas the 13(S)-hydroperoxide derivative decreases AF gene expression and production; both are sporulation factors.

The AA products, 12-(S)-HPETE and 15-(S)-HPETE, are not consistent hydroperoxide substrates since they undergo a competing transformation to the di-HETE products. Utilizing the above conditions, the selective 12-LOX and 15-LOX-1 inhibitors, probes for diabetes, stroke and asthma, are characterized for their inhibitory nature. Interestingly, ascorbic acid also supports the pseudoperoxidase assay, suggesting that it may have a role in maintaining the inactive ferrous form of LOX in the cell. In addition, it is observed that nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a known reductive LOX inhibitor, appears to generate radical species during the pseudoperoxidase assay, which are potent inhibitors against the human LOX isozymes, producing a negative pseudoperoxidase result. Therefore, inhibitors that do not support the pseudoperoxidase assay with the human LOX isozymes, should also be investigated for rapid inactivation, to clarify the negative pseudoperoxidase result.Copyright © 2013 The Authors.

Paradoxically, endothelial production of nitrogen oxides is increased in early stages of hypercholesterolemia. Prior work has shown that oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) has both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression (eNOS) and has focused on lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) as a component of oxidized LDL which may modulate this effect. Another biologically active component of oxidized LDL is 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (), an oxidized form of linoleic acid. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of HPODE on the expression of eNOS in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs). Twenty four hour treatment of endothelial cells with HPODE caused a dose-dependent increase in eNOS mRNA levels as assessed by Northern analysis. The time response studies show that HPODE treatment significantly increased eNOS mRNA levels at 12 and 24 h. Concomitant with the increase in eNOS mRNA levels, 20 microM HPODE treatment significantly increased eNOS protein content and enzyme activity. Nuclear run-on studies indicated that the rate of transcription of eNOS gene was significantly elevated 4 h after HPODE treatment when compared to control cultures. Also, actinomycin D studies demonstrated that the half-life of eNOS mRNA was increased from 6 h to 12 h by HPODE treatment. Thus, HPODE-induced up-regulation of eNOS expression is mediated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. These observations suggest that endothelial cells may attempt to compensate for oxidative injury by increasing expression of eNOS in early stages of hypercholesterolemia.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17607960>Research paper effects of  on expression of genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, iodide uptake and formation of hydrogen peroxide in porcine thyrocytes.</a></h2><p>It has been shown that dietary oxidized fats influence thyroid function in rats and pigs. Mechanism underlying this phenomenon are unknown. This study was performed to investigate whether 13-hydroperoxy-9,11 -octadecadienic acid (), a primary oxidation product of linoleic acid, affects expression of gene involved in thyroid hormone synthesis and formation of hydrogen peroxide in primary porcine thyrocytes. Thyrocytes were treated with  in concentrations between 20 and 100 microM. Cells treated with vehicle alone ("control cells") or with equivalent concentrations of linoleic acid were considered as controls. Treatment of cells with  did not affect cell viability but increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (p < 0.05) compared to control cells or cells treated with linoleic acid. Relative mRNA concentrations of genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis like sodium iodide symporter, thyrotropin receptor, and thyroid peroxidase, as well as iodide uptake, did not differ between cells treated with  and control cells or cells treated with linoleic acid. Treatment of cells with , however, reduced the relative mRNA concentrations of dual oxidase-2 and the formation of hydrogen peroxide compared to control cells or cells treated with linoleic acid (p < 0.05). Because the production of hydrogen peroxide is rate-limiting for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, it is suggested that  could have an impact on the formation of thyroid hormones in the thyroid gland.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7635978>Linoleic acid and its metabolites, hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acids, stimulate c-Fos, c-Jun, and c-Myc mRNA expression, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and growth in rat aortic smooth muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Previous studies from other laboratories suggest that linoleic acid and its metabolites, hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acids, play an important role in modulating the growth of some cells. A correlation has been demonstrated between hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acids and conditions characterized by abnormal cell growth such as atherosclerosis and psoriasis. To determine if linoleic acid and its metabolites modulate cell growth in atherosclerosis, we measured DNA synthesis, protooncogene mRNA expression, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Linoleic acid induces DNA synthesis, c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc mRNA expression and MAPK activation in VSMC. Furthermore, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a potent inhibitor of the lipoxygenase system, significantly reduced the growth-response effects of linoleic acid in VSMC, suggesting that conversion of linoleic acid to hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acids (HPODEs) is required for these effects. HPODEs also caused significant induction of DNA synthesis, protooncogene mRNA expression, and MAPK activation in growth-arrested VSMC, suggesting that linoleic acid and its metabolic products, HPODEs, are potential mitogens in VSMC, and that conditions such as oxidative stress and  peroxidation which provoke the production of these substances may alter VSMC growth.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2371285>Reductive beta-scission of the hydroperoxides of fatty acids and xenobiotics: role of alcohol-inducible cytochrome P-450.</a></h2><p>As shown previously in this laboratory, purified rabbit liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 form 2 (P-450 IIB4) catalyzes the reductive cleavage of hydroperoxides to yield hydrocarbons and either aldehydes or ketones. We have proposed that  hydroperoxides are the physiological substrates for the cleavage reaction and have shown that with  the formation of pentane is roughly equimolar with respect to the NADPH consumed. In the present study, the other product was isolated and identified as 13-oxo-9,11-tridecadienoic acid. Of particular interest, the alcohol-inducible form of liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 form 3a (P-450 IIE1) is the most active of the isozymes examined in the reductive beta-scission of the 13-hydroperoxide derived from linoleic acid and the 15-hydroperoxide derived from arachidonic acid as well as the model compounds cumyl hydroperoxide (alpha, alpha-dimethylbenzyl hydroperoxide) and t-butyl hydroperoxide. In general, the forms of P-450 with lower activity, as judged by the rate of NADPH oxidation in the reconstituted system, give less of the cleavage products (hydrocarbon and oxo compound) and catalyze direct reduction of the hydroperoxides to the corresponding hydroxy compounds. The occurrence of the reductive cleavage reaction in liver microsomal membranes was demonstrated, and microsomes from animals treated with ethanol or acetone (P-450 IIE1 inducers) or phenobarbital (a P-450 IIB4 inducer) were more active than those from untreated animals. We suggest that the alcohol-inducible P-450, in addition to its known deleterious effects in chemical toxicity and chemical carcinogenesis, may enhance the reductive cleavage of  hydroperoxides with a resultant loss in membrane integrity.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7774717> hydroperoxide-induced apoptosis: lack of inhibition by Bcl-2 over-expression.</a></h2><p>Increased membrane  peroxidation has recently been implicated as being associated with apoptosis.

Mechanisms of nonenzymatic transformation of the 9- and 13-hydroperoxides of linoleic acid to 4-hydroxyalkenals.</a></h2><p>The mechanism of formation of 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (4-HNE) has been a matter of debate since it was discovered as a major cytotoxic product of  peroxidation in 1980. Recent evidence points to 4-hydroperoxy-2E-nonenal (4-HPNE) as the immediate precursor of 4-HNE (Lee, S. H., and Blair, I. A. (2000) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 13, 698-702; Noordermeer, M. A., Feussner, I., Kolbe, A., Veldink, G. A., and Vliegenthart, J. F. G. (2000) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 277, 112-116), and a pathway via 9-hydroperoxylinoleic acid and 3Z-nonenal is recognized in plant extracts. Using the 9- and 13-hydroperoxides of linoleic acid as starting material, we find that two distinct mechanisms lead to the formation of 4-H(P)NE and the corresponding 4-hydro(pero)xyalkenal that retains the original carboxyl group (9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid). Chiral analysis revealed that 4-HPNE formed from 13S-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13S-HPODE) retains >90% S configuration, whereas it is nearly racemic from 9S-hydroperoxy-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (9S-HPODE). 9-Hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid is >90% S when derived from 9S-HPODE and almost racemic from 13S-HPODE. Through analysis of intermediates and products, we provide evidence that (i) allylic hydrogen abstraction at C-8 of 13S-HPODE leads to a 10,13-dihydroperoxide that undergoes cleavage between C-9 and C-10 to give 4S-HPNE, whereas direct Hock cleavage of the 13S-HPODE gives 12-oxo-9Z-dodecenoic acid, which oxygenates to racemic 9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid; by contrast, (ii) 9S-HPODE cleaves directly to 3Z-nonenal as a precursor of racemic 4-HPNE, whereas allylic hydrogen abstraction at C-14 and oxygenation to a 9,12-dihydroperoxide leads to chiral 9S-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid. Our results distinguish two major pathways to the formation of 4-HNE that should apply also to other fatty acid hydroperoxides. Slight ( approximately 10%) differences in the observed chiralities from those predicted in the above mechanisms suggest the existence of additional routes to the 4-hydroxyalkenals.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2988637> of eicosapentaenoic acid by aorta: formation of a novel 13-hydroxylated prostaglandin.</a></h2><p>We have investigated the  by fetal calf aorta of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6), two polyunsaturated fatty acids found in high concentrations in marine oils. The major product formed from 20:5 by particulate fractions from fetal calf aorta is delta 17-6-oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha. In addition, we detected a novel isomer of delta 17-6-oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha, in which a hydroxyl group is present in the 13-position instead of the 15-position. Eicosapentaenoic acid is also converted to 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-heptadecatetraenoic acid as well as to five monohydroxy isomers with hydroxyl groups present in the 11, 12, 14, 15, and 18 positions. Although 20:5 was metabolized at about one-third the rate of arachidonic acid (20:4), greater amounts of monohydroxy fatty acids, the major one being the 11-hydroxy metabolite, were formed from 20:5. Unlike 20:5, 22:6 was not metabolized to any detectable products by fetal calf aorta, but both of these polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibited the oxygenation of 20:4 by cyclooxygenase from aorta with IC50 values of 4.1 microM (22:6) and 15 microM (20:5). These results suggest that 20:5 has a high affinity for cyclooxygenase, but that the intermediate 11-oxygenated intermediate has a lower affinity than the corresponding intermediate from 20:4, resulting in a greater loss of substrate after a single oxygenation. The formation of oxygenation products from both 20:4 and 20:5 was inhibited by  (13hp-18:2). The IC50 values for inhibition of cyclooxygenase products by 13hp-18:2 were about twice as high as those for inhibition of prostacyclin synthase products. Consequently, there was little diversion of prostaglandin endoperoxides to other prostaglandins in the presence of 13hp-18:2.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2526551>Biosynthesis and conversions of fatty acid allene oxides.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9547550>The effect of 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) on substrate utilization by 5-lipoxygenase.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1510955>Effect of  hydroperoxide on lipoxygenase kinetics.</a></h2><p>In order to investigate the activation of lipoxygenase and to clarify the role of the oxygenation product hydroperoxide in this process, the effect of 13-hydroperoxylinoleic acid (P, 0-35 microM) on linoleic acid (S, 1-80 microM) oxygenation catalysis by 12 nM lipoxygenase-1 from soybean was studied at pH 10, 25 degrees C, and 240 microM O2 with rapid kinetic techniques. The following observations were made: (1) Iron(II) and iron(III) lipoxygenases are kinetically different: reactions started with the Fe(II) enzyme form show a lag phase, whereas iron(III) lipoxygenase induces an initial burst. (2) Oxidation of the enzyme alone is not sufficient to abolish the lag phase: at [S] greater than 50 microM, the initial burst in the iron(III) lipoxygenase curves is still followed by a lag. The lag phase disappears completely only in the presence of micromolar quantities of P. (3) The approximate dissociation constants for S and P are 15 and 24 microM, respectively, 1 order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding values in the absence of oxygen. The observed kinetics are predicted by numerical integration of the rate equations of a model based on the single  binding site mechanism for the anaerobic lipoxygenase reaction [Ludwig et al. (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 168, 325-337; Verhagen et al. (1978) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 529, 369-379]. A quasi-steady-state approximation of the model suggests that a high [S]/[P] the fraction of active iron(III) lipoxygenase is small and that, therefore, a lag phase is intrinsic to the mechanism.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17407328>Covalent adducts arising from the decomposition products of  hydroperoxides in the presence of cytochrome c.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids can be converted to  hydroperoxides through nonenzymatic and enzymatic pathways. The prototypic omega-6  hydroperoxide 13-hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid () homolytically decomposes to form highly reactive alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes, such as 9,12-dioxo-10(E)-dodecenoic acid (DODE), 4-oxo-2(E)-nonenal (ONE), 4,5-epoxy-2(E)-decenal (EDE), and 4-hydroxy-2(E)-nonenal (HNE), that can form covalent adducts with DNA. Both 4-oxo-2(E)-nonenal and 4-hydroxy-2(E)-nonenal can also modify proteins to form products that can potentially serve as biomarkers of  hydroperoxide-mediated macromolecule damage.

We are able to rule out diffusional encounter of O(2) with protein, an outer-sphere electron transfer to O(2), and proton transfer as rate-limiting steps in k(cat)/K(M)(O(2)) for wild-type enzyme (WT SLO); this restricts the rate-limiting step to either the combination of O(2) with L(*) or a subsequent conformational change. In the Ile(553) --> Phe mutant, which constricts the putative O(2) binding channel [Knapp et al. (2001) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123, 2931-2932], k(cat)/K(M)(O(2)) decreases by over a factor of 20; yet, this mutant appears to have the same rate-limiting step as WT SLO. It is argued that the slow step on k(cat)/K(M)(O(2)) is the combination of O(2) with L(*), with proximal protein effects determining the rate of reaction. The available data for SLO support the view that enzymes can affect O(2) reactivity without a direct involvement of metal cofactors. The primary role of the Fe(3+) cofactor is to generate an enzyme-bound radical, while the protein is concluded to control the stereo- and regiochemistry of O(2) encounter with this radical.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26598897>Determination of Phosphatidylcholine Hydroperoxide (PCOOH) as a Marker of Membrane Lipid Peroxidation.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence for phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH) as a marker of oxidative food deterioration and oxidative diseases has revealed the need for a pure PCOOH standard and a reliable quantification method.

A kinetic isotope effect, k(H)/k(D) = 21-24, was observed with [U-(2)H]linoleic acid as a substrate. The relative biosynthesis of (11S)-hydroperoxylinoleate (11S-HPODE) and (13R)-hydroperoxylinoleate (13R-HPODE) was pH-dependent and changed by [U-(2)H]linoleic acid. Stopped-flow kinetic traces of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids indicated catalytic lag times of approximately 45 ms, which were followed by bursts of enzyme activity for approximately 60 ms and then by steady state (k(cat) approximately 26 and approximately 47 s(-1), respectively). 11S-HPODE was isomerized by manganese lipoxygenase to 13R-HPODE and formed from linoleic acid at the same rates (k(cat) 7-9 s(-1)). Catalysis was accompanied by collisional quenching of the long wavelength fluorescence (640-685 nm) by fatty acid substrates and 13R-HPODE. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of native manganese lipoxygenase showed weak 6-fold hyperfine splitting superimposed on a broad resonance indicating two populations of Mn(II) bound to protein. The addition of linoleic acid decreased both components, and denaturation of the lipoxygenase liberated approximately 0.8 Mn(2+) atoms/lipoxygenase molecule. These observations are consistent with a mononuclear Mn(II) center in the native state, which is converted during catalysis to an EPR silent Mn(III) state.

However, detail in the reaction remains obscure. In the present study, we examined the reaction of nitric oxide with fatty acid alkoxyl radical generated in the lipoxygenase/linoleate/13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoate () system under anaerobic conditions via HPLC equipped with mass spectrometry and photodiode array detections. In this reaction system, nitric oxide can scavenge linoleate alkoxyl radical, producing 13-ONO-9Z,11E-ODE. However, instead of 13-ONO-9Z,11E-ODE, 13-NO-9E,11E-ODE and 9-NO-10E,12E-ODE were alternatively detected in the reaction solution. To explain this contradiction, we proposed a mechanism as follows: (1) 13-ONO-9E/11Z-ODE undergoes homolytic cleavage at >CHONO bond into the linoleate allyl radical and nitrogen dioxide, (2) the allyl radical undergoes resonance stabilization into the E/E-form, and (3) nitric oxide scavenges the E/E-pentadiene radical at C9 or C13 position. Consequently, we concluded that nitric oxide immediately converts fatty acid alkoxyl radical into allyl radical.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Bullfrog 12-LO was a single chain protein with a pI of 7.1-7.8 and MW of 7.77 kDa. This enzyme did not show typical Michaelis Menten type kinetics. At low substrate concentrations, it had a lag phase and at higher substrate concentrations, the activity was inhibited. The product of linoleic acid (LA), 13-hydroperoxy-9, 11-octadecadienoic acid (), was an activator for the enzyme. When arachidonic acid (AA) was used as substrate,  also affected the Km of bullfrog 12-LO towards AA. The affinity of LA towards bullfrog 12-LO was higher than the affinity of AA. Suicide inactivation was much more rapid than that of any mammalian 12-LO reported. Hemoglobin (Hb) inhibited the activity of 12-LO partially and removing Hb eliminated this inhibition. Both Hb and Met-Hb inhibited the 12-LO activity but did not denatured completely the Hb, suggesting that the inhibition was a direct interaction between 12-LO and Hb protein chain and was not due to competition between 12-LO and Hb for oxygen. This study characterizes bullfrog 12-LO with respect to stability, optimal pH, suicide inactivation and interaction with Hb and provides important evolutionary information about this enzyme.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10563421>Rapid reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic determination of the regiospecificity of lipoxygenase products on linoleic acid.</a></h2><p>A new reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method for the separation of regioisomeric products from lipoxygenase acting on linoleic acid was studied. The addition of salts to the mobile phase improved the retention and separation behaviour of  and 9-hydroperoxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid with respect to the results obtained with other mobile phases reported in the literature. The effect of the pH and ionic strength of the buffer on the retention times, capacity factor and separation factor of these lipoxygenase products were also studied. The pH optimum coincided with the pKa of linoleic acid (close to 7 depending on the fatty acid concentration). Phosphate concentrations close to 100 mM considerably reduced the retention times and led to better separation of the mixture of both products. Finally, this method was applied to the identification and separation of two linoleic acid hydroxides (13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid and 9-hydroxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid) obtained by the reduction of their corresponding hydroperoxides.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p></html>
