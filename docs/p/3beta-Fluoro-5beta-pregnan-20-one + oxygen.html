The inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) is important for the maintenance of ATP production and other functions of mitochondria. The electron transport chain (ETC) generates an electrochemical gradient of protons known as the proton-motive force across the IMM and thus produces the mitochondrial membrane potential that is critical to ATP synthesis. One of the main factors regulating the structural and functional integrity of the IMM is the changes in the matrix volume. Mild (reversible) swelling regulates mitochondrial metabolism and function; however, excessive (irreversible) swelling causes mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. The central mechanism of mitochondrial swelling includes the opening of non-selective channels known as permeability transition pores (PTPs) in the IMM by high mitochondrial Ca and reactive  species (ROS). The mechanisms of reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling and transition between these two states are still unknown. The present study elucidates an upgraded biophysical model of reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling dynamics. The model provides a description of the PTP regulation dynamics using an additional differential equation. The rigidity tensor was used in numerical simulations of the mitochondrial parameter dynamics with different initial conditions defined by Ca concentration in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum. We were able to estimate the values of the IMM rigidity tensor components by fitting the model to the previously reported experimental data. Overall, the model provides a better description of the reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling dynamics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

However, it remains unclear how glycogenolysis is coupled to neuronal activity and provides support for neuronal as well as astroglial function. At present, quantitative aspects of glycogenolysis in brain functions are very difficult to assess due to its metabolic lability, heterogeneous distributions within and among cells, and extreme sensitivity to physiological stimuli. To begin to address this problem, the present study develops a model based on pathway fluxes, mass balance, and literature relevant to functions and turnover of pathways that intersect with glycogen mobilization. A series of equations is developed to describe the stoichiometric relationships between net glycogen consumption that is predominantly in astrocytes with the rate of the glutamate-glutamine cycle, rates of astrocytic and neuronal glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, and the energetics of sodium/potassium pumping in astrocytes and neurons during brain activation. Literature supporting the assumptions of the model is discussed in detail. The overall conclusion is that astrocyte glycogen metabolism is primarily coupled to neuronal function via fueling glycolytically pumping of Na and K and sparing glucose for neuronal oxidation, as opposed to previous proposals of coupling neurotransmission via glutamate transport, lactate shuttling, and neuronal oxidation of lactate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669219>Benzimidazole-based dual dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and xanthine oxidase inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Multiple-targeting compounds might reduce complex polypharmacy of multifactorial diseases, such as diabetes, and contribute to the greater therapeutic success. Targeting reactive  species-producing enzymes, as xanthine oxidase (XO), might suppress progression of diabetes-associated vascular complications. In this study a small series of benzimidazole derivatives (1-9) was evaluated for inhibitory activity against dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and XO. One 1,3-disubstituted-benzimidazole-2-imine (5) and 1,3-thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazolone derivative (8) were shown as effective dual DPP-4 and XO inhibitors, with IC values lower than 200 μM, and predicted binding modes with both target enzymes. Both selected dual inhibitors (compounds 5 and 8) did not show cytotoxicity to a greater extent on Caco-2 cells even at concentration of 250 μM. These structures represent new non-purine scaffolds bearing two therapeutic functionalities, being DPP-4 and XO inhibitors, more favorable in comparison to DPP-4 inhibitors with DPP-4 as a single target due to pleiotropic effects of XO inhibition.Copyright © 2019.

They are driven by a complex physiopathology and most frequently a multifactorial mechanism. They can be separated in whether a decrease of  delivery (quantitative shock) or an abnormal cell distribution of cardiac output (distributive shock). Septic, cardiogenic and hypovolemic shocks represent more than 80% of shock etiologies. Clinical presentation is mostly characterized by frequent arterial hypotension and sign of poor clinical perfusion. Hyperlactatemia occurs in most of shock states. The diagnostic of shock or earlier reversible "pre-shock" states is urgent in order to initiate adequate therapy. Therefore, orientation and therapies must be discussed with intensive care physiologists in a multidisciplinary approach. Etiologic investigation and correction is a primary concern. Hemodynamic and respiratory support reflect another part of initial therapy toward normalization of cell oxygenation. Fluid resuscitation is the corner stone part of initial therapy of any form of shock. Vasoconstrictive drugs or inotropic support still often remain necessary. The primary goal of initial resuscitation should be not only to restore blood arterial pressure but also to improve clinical perfusion markers. On the biological side, decrease of lactate concentration is associated with better outcome.Copyright © 2019 Société Nationale Française de Médecine Interne (SNFMI). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Accumulating data suggest excessive oxidative stress contributes to an exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in cardiovascular-related diseases. Excessive oxidative stress is also a primary underlying mechanism for the development and progression of T2DM. However, whether oxidative stress plays a role in mediating the exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in T2DM is not known. Therefore, this review explores the potential role of oxidative stress leading to increased activation of the afferent arm of the exercise pressor reflex. Several lines of evidence support direct and indirect effects of oxidative stress on the exercise pressor reflex. For example, intramuscular ROS may directly and indirectly (by attenuating contracting muscle blood flow) increase group III and IV afferent activity. Oxidative stress is a primary underlying mechanism for the development of neuropathic pain, which in turn is associated with increased group III and IV afferent activity. These are the same type of afferents that evoke muscle pain and the exercise pressor reflex. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced release of inflammatory mediators may modulate afferent activity. Collectively, these alterations may result in a positive feedback loop that further amplifies the exercise pressor reflex. An exaggerated reflex increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Thus, identifying the contribution of oxidative stress could provide a potential therapeutic target to reduce this risk in T2DM.Copyright © 2019.

STX17 plays dual roles in autophagosome-lysosome fusion and mitochondrial fission. However, the contribution of the two functions of STX17 to apoptosis has not been extensively studied. Here, we sought to dissect the dual roles of STX17 in oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis by taking advantage of STX17 knockout cells and an autophagosome-lysosome fusion defective mutant of STX17. We generated STX17 knockout UOS cells using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system and the STX17 knockout cells were reconstituted with wild-type STX17 and its autophagosome-lysosome fusion defective mutant. Autophagy was assessed by autophagic flux assay, Monomer red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-GFP-LC3 assay and protease protection assay. Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and mitochondrial dynamics were examined by staining the different indicator proteins. Apoptosis was evaluated by caspase cleavage assay. The general reactive  species (ROS) were detected by flow cytometry. In STX17 complete knockout cells, sealed autophagosomes were efficiently formed but their fusion with lysosomes was less defective. The fusion defect was rescued by wild-type STX17 but not the autophagosome-lysosome fusion defective mutant. No obvious defects in Golgi, ERGIC or ER dynamics were observed. Mitochondria were significantly elongated, supporting a role of STX17 in mitochondria fission and the elongation caused by STX17 KO was reversed by the autophagosome-lysosome fusion defective mutant. The clearance of protein aggregation was compromised, correlating with the autophagy defect but not with mitochondrial dynamics. This study revealed a mixed role of STX17 in autophagy, mitochondrial dynamics and oxidative stress response. STX17 knockout cells were highly resistant to oxidative stress, largely due to the function of STX17 in mitochondrial fission rather than autophagy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669998>The composition difference of macrophyte litter-derived dissolved organic matter by photodegradation and biodegradation: Role of reactive  species on refractory component.</a></h2><p>The overgrowth of macrophytes has become serious due to increasing eutrophication in shallow lakes. The primary degradation processes of macrophytes litter, including photodegradation and biodegradation, induce considerable patchiness in the concentration and bioavailability of dissolved organic matter (DOM). In this study we investigated the composition evolution of DOM derived from emergent aquatic plant litter, Phragmites australis, in microbial degradation, photodegradation, and the combination of bio- and photo-degradation. Results revealed that the effects of photo- and biodegradation on the composition difference of macrophyte litter-derived DOM during short- and long-term degradation phase were different. Although large changes in DOM were observed after five days of incubation, the abundance and chemical composition were similar in the three treatments. However, more concentration of DOM was produced by combined photo- and biodegradation at the long-term degradation phase, and the composition of DOM showed less lignin-like formulae, as well as less condensed aromatic and aromatic compounds when compared to sole treatments. More reactive  species (ROS) were found under the combined treatments, thus the contents of refractory components (condensed aromatic- and aromatic compound groups) were reduced. This study provide deeper insight into the fate of DOM and relevant biogeochemical processes in eutrophic lakes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the high structural heterogeneity of metal-N-C materials that often consist of metal-N x sites and graphene-encapsulated metal nanoparticle simultaneously, as a result of their high-temperature synthesis method, makes it extremely challenging to identify the predominant active structure of metal-N-C catalysts for ORR. Here, we report a low-temperature NH 4 Cl-treatment strategy to efficiently etch out graphene-encapsulated nanoparticles from metal-N-C catalysts without destruction of co-existed atomically dispersed metal-N x sites. We observe a much enhanced catalytic activity upon selective removal of metallic nanoparticles from metal-N-C materials. Accordingly, we definitely elucidate the spectator role of graphene-encapsulated nanoparticles and the pivotal role of metal-N x sites in the metal-N-C materials for ORR in the acidic medium.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are highly conserved across species and play major roles in mounting the stress response. The emerging information now suggests that Hsp90 family of chaperones display additional cellular roles contributing to diseases like cancer. For this reason, pharmacological targeting of Hsp90 has emerged as a novel antitumor strategy. However, its mitochondrial homologue TRAP1 has not been implicated in cancer with conclusive mechanistic insights. Since understanding the mutational spectrum of cancer cells indicates the outcome of the disease as well as treatment response, we examined mutational spectrum of TRAP1. Our in silico analyses of TRAP1 SNPs and CNVs correlated with the aggressive cancer phenotypes, and are found to be predominant over Hsp90 itself. The increased CNVs have been correlated with increased expression of TRAP1 in metastatic cancer cells, increased ATP production, and decreased  consumption rate of mitochondria. Examining TRAP1 knockdown as well as over expression in metastatic cancer cells furthered our understanding that TRAP1 likely to facilitate the altered energy metabolism in the functional compromise of mitochondrial OXPHOS. Interestingly, the increased ATP levels in the TRAP1 background are found to be independent of glucose oxidation. Our results suggest TRAP1 role in triggering the alternate energy metabolism in cancer cells. Since targeting tumor metabolism is considered as an alternate strategy to combat cancer, we propose pharmacological targeting of TRAP1 to target alternate energy metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

The ponds were filled with water and  PL were released in the ponds with stocking density @ 4 m. Ponds 1 and 2 were fed with Conventional Feed (fish meal) and ponds 3 and 4 were fed with Formulated Feed (Soybean +  + ). Water quality parameters like surface water temperature, pH, dissolved , transparency, nitrate, phosphate and silicate, chlorophyll  and organic carbon were monitored for 195 days. Significant variation (p < 0.05) in the water quality parameters were observed during the culture period between ponds respectively. Growth parameters like daily growth rate (DGR), specific growth rate (SGR) and condition index (CI) were monitored simultaneously which showed a discrete growth during the first 90 days and then a stable growth form. Length and weight relationship of prawns were calculated for all the culture ponds which showed highly positive relationship (p < 0.01) proving unique contribution of feed towards the growth of prawns. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) values (Ranging from 2.74 ± .05 to 2.95 ± 0.04) also proved the greater acceptance of feed towards the growth of prawns. Biochemical analysis of the feed and prawn (protein, carbohydrate, lipid and astaxanthin) also proved the feed efficiency towards growth and coloration of prawn.

However, patients often experience a decrease in physical activity, poor nutrition, and a reduction in quality of life following surgery.The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an exercise and nursing education health informatics program on quality of life, exercise capacity, and nutrition among patients following esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.A randomized controlled trial.Patients who had undergone an esophagectomy for cancer were recruited by purposive sampling from a medical center in Taiwan. Patients who met inclusion criteria and agreed to participate (N = 88) were randomly assigned to an exercise informatics program (intervention group, n = 44) or usual post-surgery care (control group, n = 44). Quality of life was assessed at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge. Secondary outcomes of nutrition (albumin, body mass index), and exercise capacity (maximal  uptake, the six-minute walking test) were conducted at baseline and 3 months following discharge. Differences in quality of life, nutrition and exercise capacity between the two groups were analyzed using generalized estimating equations.Analysis demonstrated significant improvements in outcome measures following hospital discharge for the intervention group compared to controls. Measures of quality of life were significantly better for the intervention group and varied with time following discharge. Functional scores for physical (1 and 3 months), role (1, 3, and 6 months), emotional (1 month), social (3 months) and global health (3 months) were significantly higher than controls. Cancer-related subscales improved for insomnia (1 and 3 months) and nausea/vomiting (3 and 6 months). Esophageal cancer-specific symptoms improved for dry mouth (1 month), dysphagia (3 months), and loss of taste (1 and 6 months). Three months following discharge, levels of albumin were significantly higher for the intervention group compared to controls (β=0.32, 95% CI 0.09, 0.54, p < .01); body mass index did not differ between groups. Exercise capacity was also significantly better; the intervention group had higher maximal  consumption (β=2.61, 95% CI 1.54, 3.69, p < .001) and greater distance on the six-minute walking test (β=83.30, 95% CI 52.60, 113.99, p < .001).The intervention group experienced significant improvements in nutrition, exercise capacity, and variables related to quality of life.

We have used low pressure, inductively coupled, radio frequency  plasma for the treatment of peeled garlic cloves of a spring-planted Slovenian autochthonous cultivar. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of plasma treatment on garlic clove shoot and root growth and, ultimately, the yield. The roles of surface chemistry, surface morphology, and water uptake in these effects were also evaluated. The plasma treatment of cloves induced increases in water uptake. The increases were explained by changes in surface morphology that were determined by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Nanostructured epicuticular wax structures appeared at the cuticle surface. The optimal treatment parameters accelerated root growth, but not shoot growth, in a laboratory setting. After growth in the field, the trends indicated that plant height and dried bulb mass increase, but the improvements were not statistically significant.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670603>Naringenin Increases Insulin Sensitivity and Metabolic Rate: A Case Study.</a></h2><p>Our studies in primary human adipocytes show that naringenin, a citrus flavonoid, increases  consumption rate and gene expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), glucose transporter type 4, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, insulin, and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every 2 weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by 2.3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.5% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient. Compared to baseline, insulin decreased by 18%, but the change in glucose was not clinically significant. Other blood safety markers were within their reference ranges, and there were no adverse events.  and  mRNA expression was reduced by inhibitors of PPAR and PPAR, but there was no effect of PKA or PKG inhibition. We conclude that naringenin supplementation is safe in humans, reduces body weight and insulin resistance, and increases metabolic rate by PPAR and PPAR activation.

Six genes of the NADPH oxidase complex components, including vvnoxa, vvnoxb, vvnoxr, vvbema, vvrac1 and vvcdc24, were identified based on the complete genomic sequence of the edible fungus Volvariella volvacea. The number of vvnoxa, vvrac1, vvbema and vvcdc24 transcripts fluctuated with ageing, and the gene expression patterns of vvnoxa, vvrac1 and vvbema were significantly positively correlated. However, the expression of vvnoxb and vvnoxr showed no significant difference during ageing. In hyphae subjected to mechanical injury stress, both O and HO concentrations were increased. The expression of vvnoxa, vvrac1, vvbema and vvcdc24 was substantially upregulated, but vvnoxb and vvnoxr showed no response to mechanical injury stress at the transcriptional level. Additionally, the transcription of vvnoxa, vvrac1, vvbema and vvcdc24 could be repressed when the intracellular ROS were eliminated by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) chloride and reduced glutathione (GSH) treatments.

The various factor, including precursors, reaction time and power of sonication can affect the shape, size, and purity of the samples. We utilized X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to characterize the BaMnO nanostructures. The optical property of BaMnO nanostructures was explored by Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and the energy gap was suitable for catalytic activity (about 2.75 eV). Changing the precursor can affect the size, nanoparticle shape, architectures, and uniformity of the samples. We employed the BaMnO nanostructures for O evolution reaction as catalysts. It can observe that increasing the homogeneity of the catalysts can increase the efficiency of the  evolution reaction. The maximum amount of the O evolution and the highest TOF and TON are related to nanoplate disc using barium salicylate as a precursor of barium.

NAD-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) catalyzes the oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of PGE to generate 15-keto PGE. 15-PGDH has been known as a tumor suppressor in various malignancies including colon cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor-suppressive function of 15-PGDH remain largely unresolved. In this study, we found that 15-keto PGE upregulated the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a representative antioxidative and anti-inflammatory enzyme, at both transcriptional and translational levels in human colon epithelial CCD 841 CoN cells. A redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) plays a critical role in the regulation of HO-1 and other cytoprotective proteins. 15-Keto PGE induced translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus and antioxidant response element-driven luciferase activity. Furthermore, the silencing of the Nrf2 gene abolished 15-keto PGE-induced HO-1 expression in CCD 841 CoN cells. 15-Keto PGE activated AKT signaling, and the pharmacological AKT inhibitor, LY294002 suppressed the 15-keto PGE-induced HO-1 expression. 15-Keto PGE generates the reactive  species which is suppressed by the general antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine. N-acetyl-l-cysteine treatment attenuated the 15-keto PGE-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β, transcriptional activity of Nrf2, and subsequently HO-1 expression. However, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE lacking the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety failed to induce reactive  species, HO-1 expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2.

Nanocomposites were created by evaporation of the water-albumin dispersion with nanotubes using diode laser with temperature control. Two types of nanotubes were used. SWCNT I were synthesized using the electric arc method, SWCNT II were synthesized using the gas phase method. SWCNT I had a diameter and length less than SWCNT II. The mechanism of interaction between BSA and SWCNT in solid nanocomposites is considered. An experimental and theoretical studies of the interaction between aspartic (Asp) and glutamic (Glu) amino acids located on the outer surface of BSA and nanotubes using of vibrational spectroscopy (Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy) was carried out. The possibility of nanotubes functionalization by  atoms of negative amino acid residues Asp and Glu, which are on the outer surface of BSA, is shown by molecular modeling. The formation of covalent bonds between BSA and SWCNT in nanocomposites with different concentrations of nanotubes (0.01, 0.1 and 1 g/l) was confirmed by vibrational spectra. The covalent interaction between BSA with SWCNT under the laser irradiation leads to the conformational changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of albumin. This is confirmed by a significant decrease in the intensity of the absorption bands in the high-frequency region. The calculation of the vibrational spectra of the three Glycine:Glycine, Glutamic acid:Threonine and Aspartic acid:Lysine complexes, which take into account hydrogen, ion-dipole and ion-ion bonds, showed that a disturbance in the intermolecular interaction between amino acid residues led to significant decrease in the intensity of absorption bands in the region of stretching vibrations bonds OH and NH. From the Raman spectra, it was found that a significant number of defects in SWCNT is caused by the covalent attachment of  atoms to the graphene surface of nanotubes. An increase in the diameter of nanotubes (4 nm) has practically no effect on the absorption spectrum of nanocomposite, while measuring the concentration of SWCNT affects the FTIR spectra. This confirmed the hydrophobic interaction between BSA and SWCNT. Thus, it was shown that BSA solid nanocomposites with CNTs can interact either with the help of hydrophobic forces or with the formation of covalent bonds, which depends on the diameter of the used nanotubes. The viability of connective fibroblast tissue cells on nanocomposites with both types of SWCNT was demonstrated. It was found that nanocomposites based on SWCNT I provide slightly better compatibility of their structure with fibroblasts. It allows to achieve better cell adhesion to the nanocomposite surface. These criteria make extensive use of scaffold nanocomposites in biomedicine, depending on the requirements for their quality and application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The echinoderms, which share the earliest common ancestor with us, began to protect the body by making an endoskeleton out of calcium and carbon dioxide dissolved in the sea. In subsequent vertebrates, aerobic respiration supported strong muscle activity, but an occasional shortage of  led to low pH due to the accumulation of lactate produced by anaerobic respiration, increasing the risk of melting bones composed of calcium carbonate. So, all vertebrates used calcium phosphate to increase bone strength, having a stronger ionic bonding than calcium carbonate. But otoliths, which are in the inner ear and thereby not connected to muscles, still use calcium carbonate. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a disorder in which otoliths detached from the utricle enter the semicircular canals and cause a sense of rotation. Otoliths, the calcium carbonate ear bones retaining a long evolutionary history, can be easily broken at low pH. During sleep, shallow breathing produces mild respiratory acidosis and low pH in the blood. Since otoliths are corroded at low pH during nighttime, BPPV occurs frequently in the morning.

It has been shown that the sequestration of the parasite infected red blood cells that interact with cerebral vessel endothelial cells and the damage of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) play critical roles in the pathogenesis. In this study, we developed a ferritin nanozyme (Fenozyme) composed of recombinant human ferritin (HFn) protein shells that specifically target to BBB endothelial cells (BBB ECs), and inner Fe3O4 nanozyme core that exhibits reactive  species-scavenging catalase-like activity. In the experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) mouse model, administration of the Fenozyme, but not HFn, markedly ameliorated the damage of BBB induced by the parasite and improved the survival rate of infected mice significantly. Further investigations found that Fenozyme, as well as HFn, was able to polarize the macrophages in liver to M1 phenotype and promote the elimination of malaria in the blood. Thus, the catalase-like activity of the Fenozyme is required for its therapeutic effect in the mouse model. Moreover, the Fenozyme significantly alleviated the brain inflammation and memory impairment in ECM mice that had been treated with artemether, indicating that combining Fenozyme with anti-malaria drug is a novel strategy for the treatment of cerebral malaria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672571>Loss of the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin leads to decreased glutathione synthesis.</a></h2><p>Previous studies demonstrated that loss of CL in the yeast mutant crd1Δ leads to perturbation of mitochondrial iron‑sulfur (FeS) cluster biogenesis, resulting in decreased activity of mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe-S-requiring enzymes, including aconitase and sulfite reductase. In the current study, we show that crd1Δ cells exhibit decreased levels of glutamate and cysteine and are deficient in the essential antioxidant, glutathione, a tripeptide of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. Glutathione is the most abundant non-protein thiol essential for maintaining intracellular redox potential in almost all eukaryotes, including yeast. Consistent with glutathione deficiency, the growth defect of crd1Δ cells at elevated temperature was rescued by supplementation of glutathione or glutamate and cysteine. Sensitivity to the oxidants iron (FeSO) and hydrogen peroxide (HO), was rescued by supplementation of glutathione. The decreased intracellular glutathione concentration in crd1Δ was restored by supplementation of glutamate and cysteine, but not by overexpressing YAP1, an activator of expression of glutathione biosynthetic enzymes. These findings show for the first time that CL plays a critical role in regulating intracellular glutathione metabolism.Copyright © 2019.

While optical traps can manipulate objects in three dimensions, to date, nanoscale materials have been trapped primarily in aqueous solvents or vacuum. Here, we demonstrate the use of optical traps to manipulate, align, and assemble metal-seeded nanowire building blocks in a range of organic solvents. Anisotropic radiation pressure generates an optical torque that orients each nanowire, and subsequent trapping of aligned nanowires enables deterministic fabrication of arbitrarily long heterostructures of periodically repeating bismuth-nanocrystal/germanium-nanowire junctions. Heat transport calculations, back-focal-plane interferometry, and optical images reveal that the bismuth nanocrystal melts during trapping, facilitating tip-to-tail "nanosoldering" of the germanium nanowires. These bismuth-semiconductor interfaces may be useful for quantum computing or thermoelectric applications. In addition, the ability to trap nanostructures in - and water-free organic media broadly expands the library of materials available for optical manipulation and single-particle spectroscopy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668924>Transmembrane Nox4 topology revealed by topological determination by Ubiquitin Fusion Assay, a novel method to uncover membrane protein topology.</a></h2><p>The NADPH oxidase Nox4 is a multi-pass membrane protein responsible for the generation of reactive  species that are implicated in cellular signaling but may also cause pathological situations when dysregulated. Although topological organization of integral membrane protein dictates its function, only limited experimental data describing Nox4's topology are available. To provide deeper insight on Nox4 structural organization, we developed a novel method to determinate membrane protein topology in their cellular environment, named Topological Determination by Ubiquitin Fusion Assay (ToDUFA). It is based on the proteolytic capacity of the deubiquitinase enzymes to process ubiquitin fusion proteins. This straightforward method, validated on two well-known protein's topologies (IL1RI and Nox2), allowed us to discriminate rapidly the topological orientation of protein's domains facing either the nucleocytosolic or the exterior/luminal compartments. Using this method, we were able for the first time to determine experimentally the topology of Nox4 which consists of 6 transmembrane domains with its N- and C-terminus moieties facing the cytosol. While the first, third and fifth loops of Nox4 protein are extracellular; the second and fourth loops are located in the cytosolic side. This approach can be easily extended to characterize the topology of all others members of the NADPH oxidase family or any multi-pass membrane proteins. Considering the importance of protein topology knowledge in cell biology research and pharmacological development, we believe that this novel method will represent a widely useful technique to easily uncover complex membrane protein's topology.Copyright © 2019.

In a retrospective study, red cell compartment volume (RCV) responses to 4-weeks at 2,500m were assessed in athletes with low (n=9, ≤20 and ≤30 ng·ml for women and men, respectively) and normal (n=10) serum ferritin levels ([Ferritin]) without iron supplementation. In a subsequent prospective study, the same responses were assessed in athletes (n=26) with a protocol designed to provide sufficient iron before and during identical altitude exposure. The responses to a 4-week training camp at sea-level were assessed in another athletes (n=13) as controls. RCV and maximal  uptake (Vo) were determined at sea-level before and after intervention. In the retrospective study, athletes with low [Ferritin] did not increase RCV (27.0±2.9 to 27.5±3.8 ml·kg, mean±SD, P=0.65) nor Vo (60.2±7.2 to 62.2±7.5 ml·kg·min, P=0.23) after 4-weeks at altitude, whereas athletes with normal [Ferritin] increased both (RCV: 27.3±3.1 to 29.8±2.4 ml·kg, P=0.002; Vo: 62.0±3.1 to 66.2±3.7 ml·kg·min, P=0.003). In the prospective study, iron supplementation normalized low [Ferritin] observed in athletes exposed to altitude (n=14) and sea-level (n=6) before the altitude/sea-level camp, and maintained [Ferritin] within normal range in all athletes while the camp. RCV and Vo increased in the altitude group, but remained unchanged in the sea-level group. Finally, the increase in RCV correlated with the increase in Vo (r=0.368, 95% CI: 0.059 to 0.612, P=0.022). Thus, iron deficiency in athletes restrains erythropoiesis to altitude exposure and may preclude improvement in sea-level athletic performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673323>Hierarchically porous carbons as supports for fuel cell electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed Fe-N  moieties.</a></h2><p>The development of high-performance non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts for the  reduction reaction (ORR) is still of significance in promoting the commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, a "hierarchically porous carbon (HPC)-supporting" approach was developed to synthesize highly ORR active Fe-phenanthroline (Fe-phen) derived Fe-N  -C catalysts. Compared to commercial carbon black supports, utilizing HPCs as carbon supports can not only prevent the formation of inactive iron nanoparticles during pyrolysis but also optimize the porous morphology of the catalysts, which eventually increases the amount of reactant-accessible and atomically dispersed Fe-N  active sites. The prepared catalyst therefore exhibits a remarkable ORR activity in both half-cells (half-wave potential of 0.80 V in 0.5 M HSO) and H-air PEMFCs (442 mA cm at a working voltage of 0.6 V), making it among the best non-PGM catalysts for PEMFCs.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672029>Nrf2-induced reductive stress favours self-renewal of breast cancer stem-like cells via the FoxO3a-Bmi-1 axis.</a></h2><p>A subpopulation of cancer cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), has stemness properties, such as self-renewal and differentiation, which drive cancer recurrence and tumor resistance. CSCs possess enhanced protection capabilities to maintain reduced intracellular levels of reactive  species (ROS) compared to non-stem-like cancer cells. This study investigated whether reductive stress could regulate self-renewal activity in breast CSCs.We found that manifestation of stemness in breast cancer stem-like cells was associated with an elevated production of reduced glutathione (GSH) maintained by upregulation of glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and consequently, lowered ROS levels. This was accompanied by upregulation of P-AMPK, FoxO3a and Bmi-1. Notably, expression of Nrf2 protein was substantially increased in cells undergoing sphere formation. We noticed that expression of FoxO3a was inhibited following introduction of Nrf2 siRNA into MCF-7 mammosphere cells. Silencing of Nrf2 expression suppressed the xenograft growth of subcutaneously or orthotopically injected human breast cancer cells. Innovations: Association between Nrf2 and self-renewal signaling in CSCs has been reported, but the underling molecular mechanism remains largely unresolved. This study investigates Nrf2-mediated signaling pathway in maintenance of reductive stress in breast CSCs.Nrf2 overactivation in breast CSCs, which, in turn, upregulate GCLC expression and consequently enhances GSH biosynthesis with concurrent reduction in intracellular ROS accumulation, provoking the reductive stress. The consequent upregulation of nuclear FoxO3a and its binding to the Bmi-1 promoter, may account for the self-renewal activity of breast cancer stem-like cells and their growth in a xenograft mouse model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669409>Using a multimodal near-infrared spectroscopy and MRI to quantify gray matter metabolic rate for : A hypothermia validation study.</a></h2><p>Non-invasive quantitative imaging of cerebral  metabolism (CMRO) in small animal models is crucial to understand the role of oxidative metabolism in healthy and diseased brains. In this study, we developed a multimodal method combining near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and MRI to non-invasively study  delivery and consumption in the cortex of mouse and rat models. The term CASNIRS is proposed to the technique that measures CMRO with ASL and NIRS. To determine the reliability of this method, CMRO values were compared with reported values measured with other techniques. Also, the sensitivity of the CASNIRS technique to detect changes in CMRO in the cortex of the animals was assessed by applying a reduction in core temperature, which is known to reduce CMRO. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CMRO were measured in five mice and five rats at a core temperature of 37 °C followed by another measurement at 33 °C. CMRO was 7.8 ± 1.8 and 3.7 ± 0.9 (ml/100 g/min, mean ± SD) in mice and rats respectively. These values are in good agreement with reported values measured by O PET, O NMR, and BOLD fMRI. In hypothermia, we detected a significant decrease of 37% and 32% in CMRO in the cortex of mice and rats, respectively. Q10 was calculated to be 3.2 in mice and 2.7 in rats. In this study we showed that it is possible to assess absolute values of metabolic correlates such as CMRO, CBF and  extraction fraction (OEF) noninvasively in living brain of mice and rats by combining NIRS with MRI. This will open new possibilities for studying brain metabolism in patients as well as the many mouse/rat models of brain disorders.Copyright © 2019.

Mammals have only one member, TRPA1, which is widely expressed in sensory neurons and in non-neuronal cells (such as epithelial cells and hair cells). TRPA1 owes its name to the presence of 14 ankyrin repeats located in the N-terminus of the channel, an unusual structural feature that may be relevant to its interactions with intracellular components. TRPA1 is primarily involved in the detection of an extremely wide variety of exogenous stimuli that may produce cellular damage. This include a plethora of electrophilic compounds that interact with nucleophilic amino acid residues in the channel, and many other chemically-unrelated compounds whose only common feature seems to be their ability to partition in the plasma membrane. TRPA1 has been reported to be activated by cold, heat and mechanical stimuli, and its function is modulated by multiple factors, including Ca, trace metals, pH, and reactive , nitrogen and carbonyl species. TRPA1 is involved in acute and chronic pain, inflammation, plays a role in the pathophysiology of nearly all organ systems and is an attractive target for the treatment of related diseases. Here we review the current knowledge about the mammalian TRPA1 channel, linking its unique structure, widely tuned sensory properties and complex regulation to its roles in multiple pathophysiological conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668934>New procedure of bronchoalveolar lavage using a balloon catheter in diffuse lung diseases.</a></h2><p>Various procedures for bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) have been developed. BAL needs a wedge between the bronchoscope and the inner surface of the bronchus. The feasibility of performing BAL at the targeted position cannot be determined until immediately before the procedure. We examined BAL performed using a balloon catheter to evaluate the stability of the procedure itself and quality of the specimen obtained.The main inclusion criteria were diffuse lung disease with a shadow in the Ba area. The tip of a disposable balloon catheter was passed through the orifice of the Ba bronchus, and the balloon was expanded at the Ba bronchus. A 50-mL syringe containing saline was instilled, and gentle hand suction was performed. This procedure was repeated two more times (total: 150 mL).In all the 13 patients, the balloon of the catheter was inflated at the Ba bronchus. The median recovery rate was 34.92% ± 13.22%. These values were comparable to previously obtained BAL data (control group, N = 56) from our facility. The BAL fluid findings and final diagnosis, with the exception of one undiagnosed case, were consistent. Overall, four patients suffered an adverse event during BAL (hypoxemia). All cases were managed by increasing the  flow rate, and the adverse event did not affect the subsequent examinations.Using a balloon catheter enabled us to perform BAL at the intended bronchus.

ROP can lead to blindness because of abnormal angiogenesis that is the result of suspended vascular development and vaso-obliteration leading to severe retinal stress and hypoxia. We tested the hypothesis that the use of the human progenitor cell combination, bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells and vascular wall-derived endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs), would synergistically protect the developing retinal vasculature in a mouse model of ROP, called -induced retinopathy (OIR). CD34+ cells alone, ECFCs alone, or the combination thereof were injected intravitreally at either P5 or P12 and pups were euthanized at P17. Retinas from OIR mice injected with ECFCs or the combined treatment revealed formation of the deep vascular plexus (DVP) while still in hyperoxia, with normal-appearing connections between the superficial vascular plexus (SVP) and the DVP. In addition, the combination of cells completely prevented aberrant retinal neovascularization and was more effective anatomically and functionally at rescuing the ischemia phenotype than either cell type alone. We show that the beneficial effects of the cell combination are the result of their ability to orchestrate an acceleration of vascular development and more rapid ensheathment of pericytes on the developing vessels. Lastly, our proteomic and transcriptomic data sets reveal pathways altered by the dual cell therapy, including many involved in neuroretinal maintenance, and principal component analysis (PCA) showed that cell therapy restored OIR retinas to a state that was closely associated with age-matched normal retinas. Together, these data herein support the use of dual cell therapy as a promising preventive treatment for the development of ROP in premature infants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667811>Glycogenolysis in Cerebral Cortex During Sensory Stimulation, Acute Hypoglycemia, and Exercise: Impact on Astrocytic Energetics, Aerobic Glycolysis, and Astrocyte-Neuron Interactions.</a></h2><p>Most glycogen in cerebral cortex is located in astrocytes, and the importance of glycogenolysis for critical functions, including neurotransmission and memory consolidation, is strongly supported by many studies. However, specific mechanisms through which glycogen sustains essential functions remain to be established by rigorous, quantitative studies. Cerebral cortical glycogen concentrations are in the range of 10-12 μmol/g in carefully-handled animals, and the calculated rate of glycogenolysis (CMR) during sensory stimulation is approximately 60% that of glucose utilization (CMR) by all cells, with lower rates during acute hypoglycemia and exercise to exhaustion. CMR is at least fourfold higher when the volume fraction of astrocytes is taken into account. Inclusion of glycogen consumed during sensory stimulation in calculation of the -glucose index (OGI = CMR/CMR, which has a theoretical maximum of 6 when no other substrates are metabolized) reduces OGI from 5.0 to 2.8. Thus, at least 53% of the carbohydrate is not oxidized, suggesting that glycogen mobilization supports astrocytic glycolysis, not neuronal oxidation of glycogen-derived lactate that would cause OGI to exceed 6. Failure of glycogenolysis to dilute the specific activity of lactate formed from blood-borne [6-C]glucose indicates compartmentation of glycolytic metabolism of glucose and glycogen and the rapid release from cerebral cortex of glycogen-derived lactate. Together, these findings invalidate the conclusion by others that glycogen-derived lactate is a major fuel for neurons during neurotransmission, memory consolidation, and exercise to exhaustion. Alternative mechanisms, including glucose sparing for neurons, are presented as testable explanations for data interpreted as lactate shuttling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669237>Three rare pathogenic mtDNA substitutions in LHON patients with low heteroplasmy.</a></h2><p>In this article we present clinical, molecular and biochemical investigations of three patients with LHON caused by rare point substitutions in mtDNA.

Four footwear conditions with identical outsoles, insoles, upper materials, but different mechanical properties regarding polyurethane midsole materials were investigated. Respective midsole material characteristics were selected to represent a wide range of running shoes. The test procedure for eighteen well-trained male runners was divided into three treadmill testing sessions: an incremental ramp protocol to estimate the individual ventilatory threshold (day 1), a test with 6-minute stages in each shoe at 70% (aerobic, day 2) and 102% (anaerobic, day 3) of the participant's ventilatory threshold. For  uptake and the heart rate, no significant differences between footwear conditions were found for either running condition. Furthermore, no significant relationships between physiological variables and mechanical midsole characteristics were found. The wide range of significant stiffness differences in the rearfoot (52.7 N/mm) and forefoot areas (50.7 N/mm), as well as significant differences of the shoe midsole material energy loss in the rearfoot (18.8%) and forefoot areas (10.7%) were too low to influence physiological variables significantly when running below and slightly above the ventilatory threshold. It seems that shoe mass and shoe comfort can influence physiological variables more than the mechanical midsole characteristics of stiffness and energy loss.

Consequently, we aimed to investigate the effect of these nanoparticles on hepatic regeneration after liver injury by partial hepatectomy and acetaminophen overdose.All the in vitro experiments were performed in HepG2 cells. For the acetaminophen and partial hepatectomy experimental models, male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: (1) nanoparticles group, which received 0.1 mg/kg cerium nanoparticles i.v. twice a week for 2 weeks before 1 g/kg acetaminophen treatment, (2) N-acetyl-cysteine group, which received 300 mg/kg of N-acetyl-cysteine i.p. 1 h after APAP treatment and (3) partial hepatectomy group, which received the same nanoparticles treatment before partial hepatectomy. Each group was matched with vehicle-controlled rats.In the partial hepatectomy model, rats treated with cerium oxide nanoparticles showed a significant increase in liver regeneration, compared with control rats. In the acetaminophen experimental model, nanoparticles and N-acetyl-cysteine treatments decreased early liver damage in hepatic tissue. However, only the effect of cerium oxide nanoparticles was associated with a significant increment in hepatocellular proliferation. This treatment also reduced stress markers and increased cell cycle progression in hepatocytes and the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB in vitro and in vivo.Our results demonstrate that the nanomaterial cerium oxide, besides their known antioxidant capacities, can enhance hepatocellular proliferation in experimental models of liver regeneration and drug-induced hepatotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672399>Iatrogenic Arterial Gas Embolism From Esophagogastroduodenoscopy.</a></h2><p>Arterial gas embolus (AGE) is a rare complication of esophagoduodenoscopy (EGD) that has been described in only a few case reports in the literature.

During the procedure, he suffered a tonic-clonic seizure, bradycardia, and hypoxia. Subsequent emergency department workup showed pneumocephalus on computed tomography brain imaging, and he was diagnosed with a cerebral AGE (CAGE). He was transferred to our facility for treatment of CAGE with hyperbaric  therapy (HBOT). After multiple hyperbaric treatments, he was discharged with a residual left hemiparesis, which represented a significant improvement in his overall neurologic status. We also present a review of similar EGD CAGE cases from the literature and discuss their outcomes and the need for HBOT. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Although CAGE from EGD is rare, these patients will often be transferred to the ED from gastrointestinal procedural suites and an emergency physician should understand that an iatrogenic CAGE can result from this procedure and that CAGE is a clinical diagnosis.

Bioreductive agents represent a class of prodrugs that target hypoxic tumor cells. Their bioactivity depends on the reactivity of their functional chemical groups. Their efficacy requires metabolic reduction and subsequent generation of toxic prodrugs. Chemoresistance of tumor cells is a major problem for successful antitumor therapy for many types of tumors, especially for breast cancer. The present study was performed to assess the effect of the antiproliferation activity of the tested benzimidazoles by way of NF-κB expression inhibition. The activity of the tested compounds on T47D and MCF7 cells was examined by WST, western blot, NF-κB transactivation assay, and apoptotic cell population analysis. Compound 3 was highly cytotoxically active against T47D cells, especially in hypoxic conditions. Its IC of 0.31 ± 0.06 nM, although weaker than tirapazamine, was significantly higher than the other tested compounds (2.4-3.0 fold). The increased bax protein expression upon exposure to the tested compounds indicated intercellular apoptotic pathway activity, with tumor cell death by way of apoptosis. Increased bax protein synthesis and apoptotic cell dominance upon treatment, especially with N-oxide derivatives (92% apoptotic cells among T47D cell populations during treatment with compound 3), were correlated with each other. Additionally, both increased bax protein and decreased NF-κB protein expression supported antiproliferative activity via NF-κB-DNA binding inhibition associated with the tested compounds. Compound 3 appeared to be the strongest inhibitor of NF-κB expression in hypoxic conditions (the potency against NF-κB expression was about 75% of that of tirapazamine). The present studies involving this class of heterocyclic small molecules proved their potential usefulness in anticancer therapy as compounds be able to limit tumor cell proliferation and reverse drug resistance by NF-κB repression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672370>Effects of phosphorus availability and phosphorus utilization behavior of Microcystis aeruginosa on its adaptation capability to ultraviolet radiation.</a></h2><p>Phosphorus (P) plays a critical role in eutrophication and algal growth; therefore, improving our understanding of the impact of P is essential to control harmful algal blooms. In this study, Microcystis aeruginosa was treated with 5-h ambient irradiation in the medium with different dissolved inorganic P (DIP) concentrations, DIP-free, moderate-DIP, and high-DIP, to explore its growth and other physiological responses. Compared to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), UV-A (320-400 nm) and UV-B (280-320 nm) radiation had inhibitive effects on the photosynthesis and growth of M. aeruginosa, while high P availability could alleviate or eliminate the negative effects of UV radiation. The photosynthetic parameters had a minimum reduction and quickly recovered after re-inoculation under high-DIP conditions. Confirmed by SEM, photosynthetic pigments, the generation of reactive  species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and other methods, ambient UV radiation exerted oxidative stresses rather than direct lethal effects on M. aeruginosa. Photosynthetic parameters indicated that algal UV-adaptation processes could include decreasing photo-induced damages and increasing self-repair efficiency. The P acquired by M. aeruginosa cells can have two function, which included alleviating UV-induced negative effects and sustaining algal growth. Consequently, UV-adaptation processes of M. aeruginosa resulted in an elevated demand for DIP, which resulted to increased P uptake rates and cellular P quota under moderate and high-DIP conditions. Therefore, the production of carotenoid and phycocyanin, and SOD activity increased under UV stress, leading to a better adaptation capability of M. aeruginosa and decreased negative effects of UV radiation on its growth. Overall, our findings demonstrated the significant interactive effects of P enrichment and irradiation on typical cyanobacteria, and the strong adaptation capability of M. aeruginosa in the eutrophic UV-radiated waters.Copyright © 2019.

Oxidative stress apparently produces Aβ dimers that are covalently linked through two tyrosine residues. Such dityrosine cross-links are considered as potential markers of the disease and seem to be implicated in the pathological disorder. In the present study, pure o,o'-dityrosine (diY) was prepared enzymatically (with horseradish peroxidase; HRP), which was subsequently used to construct calibration lines aimed at quantifying nanomolar amounts of diY in reaction mixtures by fluorescence spectroscopy. Hence, diY concentrations down to 67 nM could be determined, which allowed to find that ca. 3% of dityrosine-bridged dimers of Aβ(1-40) were produced after 3 days at 37 °C in the presence of copper and dihydrogen peroxide. These cross-linked dimers in the presence of copper(II) ions completely inhibit the typical aggregation of Aβ, since β sheets could not be detected applying the usual Thioflavin T (ThT) method. Furthermore, the use of a potent Cu(II) chelator, such as the ATCUN tripeptide, L-histidyl-L-alanyl-L-histidine (HAH), efficiently prevented the copper-mediated generation of ROS and the associated dityrosine-bridged Aβ dimers, suggesting that such metal chelators may find future applications in the field of anti-AD drug design.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670016>N, S-codoped CNTs supported CoS nanoparticles prepared by using CdS nanorods as sulfur sources and hard templates: An efficient catalyst for reversible  electrocatalysis.</a></h2><p>Non-precious efficient bifunctional catalysts towards  reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) are highly desired to enable the widespread application of rechargeable Zn-air batteries (r-ZABs). Herein, Prussian blue analogues (PBA) anchored on CdS nanorods (CdS NRs) pre-coated with polydopamine (PDA) are utilized as precursors to prepare ultrafine CoS nanoparticles supported on N, S-codoped CNTs (CoS@N,S-CNT), where CdS NRs are served as sulfur sources and hard templates. After pyrolysis, the resulting CoS@N,S-CNT-800 shows a high specific surface area of 142.4 m g, together with merely 0.780 V difference between the OER potential at 10 mA cm and the ORR potential at 3 mA cm. The CoS@N,S-CNT-800 based air cathode displays a higher discharge capacity of 787 mAh g at 10 mA cm, a higher output power density of 154 mW cm, better working stability, as well as a lower charge-discharge voltage gap than the Pt/C + RuO based air electrode at various working current density. The remarkable  reversible catalytic activities are mainly attributed to the presence of a thin layer of mesoporous carbon on partial sections of the open-end N,S-CNTs, which not only shortens the mass diffusion length but also prevents N,S-CNTs from excessively bundling to maximize the exposure of CoS nanocrystallites and graphitized carbon skeletons with N or S heteroatoms.Copyright © 2019.

They affect the pathophysiology and treatment of conditions like hemorrhagic shock (HS) but direct noninvasive measures of flow, PO and their heterogeneity during prolonged HS are infrequently presented. To fill this void, we report the first quantitative evaluation of flow-PO relationships and heterogeneities in normovolemia and during several hours of HS using noninvasive unbiased automated acquisition. Anesthetized rats were subjected to tracheostomy, arterial/venous catheterizations, cremaster muscle exteriorization, hemorrhage (40% total blood volume) and laparotomy. Control animals equally instrumented were not subjected to hemorrhage/laparotomy. Every 0.5 h during 4.5 hours, noninvasive laser speckle contrast imaging and phosphorescence quenching were employed for nearly 7000 flow/PO measurements in muscles from 8 animals using an automated system. Precise alignment of 16 muscle areas allowed overlapping between flow and oxygenation measurements to evaluate spatial heterogeneity and repeated measurements were used to estimate temporal heterogeneity. Systemic physiological parameters and blood chemistry were simultaneously assessed by blood samplings replaced with crystalloids. Hemodilution was associated with local hypoxia but increased flow prevented major  delivery decline. Adding laparotomy and prolonged HS resulted in hypoxia, ischemia, decreased tissue  delivery and logarithmic flow/PO relationships in most regions. Flow and PO spatial heterogeneities were higher than their respective temporal heterogeneities although did not change significantly over the studied period. This quantitative framework establishes a basis for evaluating therapies aimed at restoring muscle homeostasis, positively impacting outcomes of civilian and military trauma/HS victims.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670228>Hydrothermal carbonization of different wetland biomass wastes: Phosphorus reclamation and hydrochar production.</a></h2><p>Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) has drawn increasing interest for the disposal of solid wastes with a high moisture content, while minimal attention has been paid to HTC treatment of wetland plants and the corresponding phosphorus (P) transformation. In order to evaluate its feasibility for wetland plants treatment, hydrochars from different wetland plants were produced at different temperatures (200 °C, 220 °C, 240 °C, and 260 °C) and characterized, and the transformation of P was investigated. In comparison with wetland plant derived biochars, the derived hydrochars had a moderate pH (5.0-7.7), more -containing groups, and higher energy density (18.0-27.1 MJ kg). These properties were affected by hydrothermal temperature and feedstock choice. In contrast to high water-soluble P in biomass (71.0-73.2% of total P), more recalcitrant P species formed in hydrochars, implying that HTC treatment could achieve P immobilization and reduce P leaching loss. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results indicated that monoester-P and soluble orthophosphate were transformed to insoluble orthophosphate during the HTC treatment. Therefore, HTC is a promising treatment technique for wetland plants to produce valuable char with P reclamation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) is a leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the DARS2 gene which encodes mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. As mitochondrial ARSs are key components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus, we investigated the effects of DARS2 mutations on mitochondrial functions and mitochondrial morphology in an LBSL patient. In fibroblasts from the patient with LBSL, biosynthesis of respiratory chain complex proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA was decreased, while those encoded by nuclear DNA were not. Cellular  consumption rates and respiratory control ratio were decreased in the LBSL patient; in addition, fragmentation of mitochondria was increased, while their tubular elongation and interconnectivity were decreased. Taken together, these findings suggest that DARS2 mutations impair translations of mitochondrial DNA-encoded respiratory chain complex proteins, consequently causing dysfunction of cellular respiration and impediment of mitochondrial dynamics, which highlights the role of mtARSs in the maintenance of normal mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666571>Rapid solvent-evaporation strategy for three-dimensional cobalt-based complex hierarchical architectures as catalysts for water oxidation.</a></h2><p>It is a challenging task to seek a highly-efficient electrocatalyst for  evolution reaction (OER) of water splitting. Non-noble Co-based nanomaterials are considered as earth-abundant and effective catalysts to lower overpotential and increase polarization current density of OER. In this work, we reported, for the first time, a "rapid solvent-evaporation" strategy for the synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) cobalt complex hierarchical architectures constructed by two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets. The 3D structured cobalt complexes have excellent performances in catalyzing OER with lower onset potential, overpotential, Tafel slope and better stability than commercial IrO. Superior electrochemical performances would be beneficial from the unique 3D structure.

This study attempted to reveal the biological function of MALAT1 in AMI.Expression of MALAT1 in H9c2 cells was silenced by shRNA-mediated transfection, following which cells were suffered from -glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R). CCK-8, flow cytometry and western blot were carried out to evaluate the effects of MALAT1 against OGD/R injury. Further, the correlation between MALAT1, miR-122 and AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling was studied to decode the underlying mechanisms.MALAT1 expression was highly expressed following OGD/R. Suppression of MALAT1 attenuated OGD/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, as evidenced by the increase of cell viability and the decrease of apoptosis rate. Besides that, miR-122 was found to be positive regulated by MALAT1. The protective effects of MALAT1 knockdown were flattened by miR-122 overexpression. Furthermore, AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling was activated by MALAT1 knockdown. The effects of MALAT1 knockdown on the signaling were flattened when miR-122 was overexpressed.Our finding revealed protective effects of MALAT1 knockdown on OGD/R induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a ligand-inducible transcription factor and plays an important role in fatty acid metabolism. Our previous study found that 1-O-alkyl glycerophosphate (AGP), a naturally occurring ether analog of lysophosphatidic acid, is a high-affinity, partial agonist of PPARγ. In this study, we investigated the role of AGP in microglial activation and illustrated the underlying molecular mechanism. We found that AGP treatment increased the production of intracellular reactive  species and induced PPARγ activation in microglial cells. Interestingly, AGP also up-regulated the expression levels of the cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) scavenger receptor, a high-affinity receptor for oxidized low-density lipoproteins. The findings suggest that AGP induces PPARγ activation, enhances CD36 expression and increases the production of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) in microglial cells.Copyright © 2019.

The obtained palladium(II) complexes have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy, ESI-mass spectrometry as well as elemental analysis. The cytotoxicity analysis indicates that most of the obtained palladium(II) complexes show promising growth inhibition in three human cancer cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis shows complex 3e could promote intracellular reactive  species (ROS) accumulation and lead cancer cell death. And the suppression of ROS accumulation and the rescue of cell viability in HeLa cells by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) suggest the possible link between the increase in ROS generation and cytotoxicity of complex 3e. Flow cytometry analysis also reveal that complex 3e cause cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, promote the generation of ROS and lead to tumor cell apoptosis. The interactions of complex 3e with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) have been evaluated by UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence quenching experiments and viscosity measurements, which reveal that the complex interact with CT-DNA through minor groove binding and/or electrostatic interactions.

Here, hetero-layered nanostructures of Ni-Fe hydroxide/oxide with a high activity for an  evolution reaction (OER) were synthesized on a 316 stainless steel (SS) substrate through constant current density electrolysis. The thicknesses, morphologies, and compositions of the nanostructures, generated through dealloying and surface oxidation of the SS elements with severe  micro-bubble evolution, were dependent on the electrolysis time. Nano-structural analyses showed that Ni-Fe hydroxide/oxide hetero-layered nanostructures were generated during the initial stage of electrolysis, growing nanofiber-like Ni-Fe hydroxide layers with increasing electrolysis time up to 5 h. The prolonged electrolysis resulted in densification of the nanofiber structures. The OER overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 was estimated to be 254 mV at 20 °C, demonstrating better performance than that of a standard OER catalyst, e.g., Ir oxide, and obtaining the value of Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH). Furthermore, the OER property surpassed the Ni-Fe LDH catalysts at high current density regions greater than 100 mA/cm2. Moreover, stable electrolysis was achieved for 20 h at conditions similar to that of the practical AWE of 400 mA/cm2 in 20 and 75 ℃ solution. Therefore, the simple surface modification method could synthesize highly active nanostructures for alkaline water splitting anodes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666411>[The fenofibrate effect on genotoxicity in brain and liver and on the expression of genes regulating fatty acids metabolism of mice].</a></h2><p>Fibrates are well-known agonists of the PPAR family (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors). This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of body weight in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of liver cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive  species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and liver cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects lipid metabolism in the liver and brain, but in the liver it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis. This is consistent with the recent suggestion that PGC-1α might not be a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669521>Role of hypoxia in skeletal muscle fibrosis: Synergism between hypoxia and TGF-β signaling upregulates CCN2/CTGF expression specifically in muscle fibers.</a></h2><p>Several skeletal muscle diseases are characterized by fibrosis, the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/CTGF) are two profibrotic factors augmented in fibrotic skeletal muscle, together with signs of reduced vasculature that implies a decrease in  supply. We observed that fibrotic muscles are characterized by the presence of positive nuclei for hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a key mediator of the hypoxia response. However, it is not clear how a hypoxic environment could contribute to the fibrotic phenotype in skeletal muscle. We evaluated the role of hypoxia and TGF-β on CCN2 expression in vitro. Fibroblasts, myoblasts and differentiated myotubes were incubated with TGF-β1 under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia and TGF-β1 induced CCN2 expression synergistically in myotubes but not in fibroblasts or undifferentiated muscle progenitors. This induction requires HIF-1α and the Smad-independent TGF-β signaling pathway. We performed in vivo experiments using pharmacological stabilization of HIF-1α or hypoxia-induced via hindlimb ischemia together with intramuscular injections of TGF-β1, and we found increased CCN2 expression. These observations suggest that hypoxic signaling together with TGF-β signaling, which are both characteristics of a fibrotic skeletal muscle environment, induce the expression of CCN2 in skeletal muscle fibers and myotubes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Nonetheless, their low bioavailability forecasts controversy about mechanisms on their in vivo scavenging activity against reactive  species (ROS). It has been proposed that PC reduce directly ROS concentration. An alternative or complementary action of PC could be the activation of the cell's antioxidant pathway, involving the regulation of gene expression, like that initiated by the Nrf2 transcription factor. To date there is not enough experimental data to support or discard this possibility. In the present study, we evaluated the use of several PC to prevent peroxidation of macromolecules and to elicit the activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor in HO-stresed IEC-6 enterocytic cell line. Synchrotron microspectroscopy demonstrated that PC compounds protected proteins, lipids and nucleic acids against oxidation induced by HO. Immunofluorescence results showed that treatment with quercetin (Qc), catechin (Cat) and capsaicin (Cap) induced the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus, at the same level as did HO treatment, thus mimicking the action of the endogenous cell response to peroxidation. Even though the detailed mechanism still needs to be elucidated, we demonstrated the activation of Nrf2 by PCs in response to oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Artemisinin has been reported to sensitize cervical cancer cells to radiotherapy. In the present study, we determined whether ART and ARM could enhance the cytotoxicity of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) against the mammary tumor cells of mice.

At light doses of 3 and 5 J/cm, the viability of 5-ALA-PDT-treated cells significantly decreased with ART ( < 0.01 and  < 0.01) and ARM treatment ( < 0.01 and  < 0.01). Besides, the number of annexin V-FITC and ethidium homodimer III-positive cells was greater in the 5-ALA-PDT with ARM group than that in the other groups. -acetylcysteine could not significantly inhibit the percentages of apoptotic cells or inviable cells induced by 5-ALA-PDT with ARM. These reactive  species-independent mechanisms might enhance cytotoxicity in 5-ALA-PDT with ARM-treated tumor cells, suggesting that the use of 5-ALA-PDT with ARM could be a new strategy to enhance PDT cytotoxicity against tumor cells.

Both experimental studies and molecular dynamics simulations were applied to estimate the diffusion coefficients and solubilities of various gases, such as helium (He),  (O), nitrogen (N), and methane (CH). The validity of the results obtained was confirmed by studying the correlation of the experimental solubilities and diffusion coefficients of He, O, and N in R-BAPB, with their critical temperatures and the effective sizes of the gas molecules, respectively. The solubilities obtained in the molecular dynamics simulations are in good quantitative agreement with the experimental data. A good qualitative relationship between the simulation results and the experimental data is also observed when comparing the diffusion coefficients of the gases. Analysis of the Robeson plots shows that R-BAPB has high selectivity for He, N, and CO separation from CH, which makes it a promising polymer for developing gas-separation membranes.

Additionally, retinopathy has also been observed in young DD patients, leading to vision loss. Emerging evidence show LAMP2-deficiency to be involved in oxidative stress (ROS) but the mechanism remains obscure. In the present study, we found that tert-butyl hydroperoxide or antimycin A induced more cell death in LAMP2 knockdown (LAMP2-KD) than in control ARPE-19 cells. Mechanistically, LAMP2-KD reduced the concentration of cytosolic cysteine, resulting in low glutathione (GSH), inferior antioxidant capability and mitochondrial lipid peroxidation. ROS induced RPE cell death through ferroptosis. Inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) increased lethality in LAMP2-KD cells compared to controls.

Vegetated filter strips are used to treat silage bunker runoff to prevent contamination of surface waters via infiltration, however increased infiltration poses risks to groundwater, particularly for nitrate (NO). Vegetated filter strip plots with a sandy loam soil, half of which are amended with biochar, were investigated to assess the treatment of silage bunker runoff over 20 application events. The subsurface effluent biological  demand (BOD), chemical  demand (COD), and total phosphorus (TP) were reduced on average by 40%, 46%, and 75%, respectively, and there was no statistical difference between treatments. The total nitrogen (TN) was reduced by 49 and 64% for control and biochar plots, respectively, which was significantly different between treatments. Biochar significantly reduced nitrate nitrogen (NO-N) leaching by 40% compared to the control, however, the NO-N concentration in leachate was still high ranging from 0.19 to 191.04 mg NO-N L and 0.18-108.89 mg NO-N L for control and biochar plots, respectively. A mass balance suggests the primary mechanism for a decrease in TN and NO-N leaching from biochar amended plots was greater retention of NO-N and organic N (ORG-N) within the soil/biochar matrix. The development of oxygenated functional groups and/or formation of organomineral layer on the biochar surface likely enhanced N retention.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Yet, hybrid Density Functional Theory/Molecular Mechanical (DFT/MM) calculations of oxy-Mb models predict that the O bond is much less resistant to breaking in the presence of hydrogen sulfide (HS) compared with water. Specifically, a hydrogen atom from HS can be transferred to the distal  atom through homolytic cleavage of the S-H bond to form the intermediate Compound (Cpd) 0 structure and a thiyl radical. In the presence of a neutral His64 (Nε protonation, His64-ε) and HS, only a metastable Cpd 0 would be formed as the active site is devoid of any additional proton donor to fully break the O bond. In contrast, the calculations predict that the triplet state is significantly favored over the open shell singlet diradical state throughout the entire reaction coordinate in the presence of HS and a positively charged His64. Furthermore, a positively charged His64 can readily donate a proton to Cpd 0 to fully break the O bond resulting in a configuration analogous to reported reaction models of a hemoglobin mutant bound to HO with HS present. Typically, exotic techniques are required to generate Cpd 0 but under the conditions just described the intermediate is readily detected in UV-Vis spectra at room temperature. The effect is observed as a 2 nm red shift of the Soret band from 414 nm to 416 nm (pH 5.0, His64-εδ) and from 416 nm to 418 nm (pH 6.6, His64-ε).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Oxidative stress attenuates melanoma metastasis, and melanoma cells must reduce oxidative stress to metastasize. We explored this in sarcomas by screening for oxidative stress sensitizers, which identified the class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 as enhancing vulnerability to reactive  species (ROS) in sarcoma cells. Mechanistically, MS-275 inhibits YB-1 deacetylation, decreasing its binding to 5'-UTRs of NFE2L2 encoding the antioxidant factor NRF2, thereby reducing NFE2L2 translation and synthesis of NRF2 to increase cellular ROS. By global acetylomics, MS-275 promotes rapid acetylation of the YB-1 RNA-binding protein at lysine-81, blocking binding and translational activation of NFE2L2, as well as known YB-1 mRNA targets, HIF1A, and the stress granule nucleator, G3BP1. MS-275 dramatically reduces sarcoma metastasis in vivo, but an MS-275-resistant YB-1K81-to-alanine mutant restores metastatic capacity and NRF2, HIF1α, and G3BP1 synthesis in MS-275-treated mice. These studies describe a novel function for MS-275 through enhanced YB-1 acetylation, thus inhibiting YB-1 translational control of key cytoprotective factors and its pro-metastatic activity.© 2019 The Authors.

The bromine mass balance analysis showed that bromide ion and HOBr/OBr occupied 19.5% of total Br and brominated organic compounds accounted for the remaining percentages at pH 7.0. No formation of bromate was observed. Based on the identified products, a reaction pathway was proposed, which included oxidation, β-scission, hydroxylation, and dimerization reaction pathways. The results indicate that unactivated PMS is useful for the remediation of TBBPA contaminated water.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. The combined intervention consisted of 10 sessions of HBOT before the intrapancreatic infusion of ASC and 10 sessions afterwards. ASCs were infused into the main arterial supply of the pancreas to maximize the presence of the stem cells where the therapeutic effect is most desired. A total of 23 patients were included (control group = 10, intervention group = 13). Age, gender, diabetes duration, number of medications taken, body weight and height, and insulin requirements were recorded at baseline and every three months. Also, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, C-peptide, and HbA1c, C-peptide/glucose ratio (CPGR) were measured every three months for one year. HbA1c was significantly lower in the intervention group compared with control throughout follow-up. Overall, 77% of patients in the intervention group and 30% of patients in the control group demonstrated a decrease of HbA1c at 180 days (compared with baseline) of at least 1 unit. Glucose levels were significantly lower in the intervention group at all timepoints during follow-up. C-peptide levels were significantly higher in the intervention group during follow-up and at one year: 1.9 ± 1.0 ng/mL versus 0.7 ± 0.4 ng/mL in intervention versus control groups, respectively,  = 0.0021. CPGR was higher in the intervention group at all controls during follow-up. The requirement for insulin was significantly lower in the intervention group at 90, 180, 270, and 365 days. Combined therapy of intrapancreatic ASC infusion and HBOT showed increased metabolic control and reduced insulin requirements in patients with T2DM compared with standard treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670099>Enhanced reactivity of zero-valent aluminum with ball milling for phenol oxidative degradation.</a></h2><p>Micron-sized zero-valent aluminum (ZVAl), a heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst in organic wastewater treatment, whose catalytic activity is limited by the dense and stable oxide layer coating on its surface. In this paper, a simple method of ball milling was exploited to pretreat inert aluminum particles with the addition of low-cost and non-toxic sodium chloride (NaCl) grains. Then the pretreated ZVAl (marked as ZVAl) was employed to activate molecular  catalytically for phenol oxidative degradation. No induction period was observed in ZVAl/Air system. Meanwhile, the reaction rate and mineralization efficiency of phenol degradation had improved in contrast with the original ZVAl. The characterization results of SEM-EDS, BET, XRD and XPS revealed that the native oxide layer of ZVAl was destroyed and became rougher, where its surface was embedded in NaCl grains. Thus the dissolution of NaCl in aqueous solution was imagined to expose the fresh surface of ZVAl, facilitating the electron transfer at the interface of ZVAl/HO. Moreover, the specific surface area of ZVAl increased for ball milling improved its surface roughness, resulting in the enhanced reactivity of ZVAl. The interfacial reaction mechanism was revealed that more dissolved  (DO) was activated by the exposed surface of ZVAl to form large amounts of hydrogen peroxide (HO). Then in-situ production of HO was catalyzed by the active-surface of ZVAl via a Fenton-like process to generate massive OH, which was detected as the predominant active species for phenol degradation. Finally, the reusability experiment indicated that ball milling could rejuvenate the main catalytic activity of used ZVAl easily. In summary, ball milling provides a green and easily-operated method to promote the reactivity of inert ZVAl for its application in organic wastewater treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Zn-TNE treated seeds bestowed better seedling vigor index and higher activities of seed stored food mobilizing enzymes (α-amylase and protease). Foliar application of Zn-TNE (0.01-0.06%, v/v) enhanced defense-antioxidant enzymes activities, balanced reactive  species, induced higher content of chlorophyll-a, b and higher lignin deposition in soybean plants. In the field, Zn-TNE application (0.02-0.06%, v/v) significantly controlled bacterial pustule disease (PEDC value 28-79%) and increased grain yield up to 16.6% as compared with bulk thymol application and up to 50% from control. Disease control and higher yield in soybean could be explained by diverse bioactivities of Zn-TNE in maintaining cellular homeostasis of soybean plants.

A 3-cm layer of Zeolite (ZL) or activated carbon (AC) was placed on the contaminated sediments, and nonwoven fabric mats (NWFM) were placed on top of these capping materials. Laboratory incubation experiments were performed under three different temperatures, namely 4, 15, and 30 °C. Under the uncapped condition at 30 °C, dissolved  (DO) was depleted after 30 days, while at 4 °C and 15 °C, DO was present until the end of this experiment. DO concentration in overlying water was more dependent on the temperature than capping condition. ZL/NWFM effectively blocked the release of N from the sediments, and the capping efficiencies of ZL/NWFM for NH-N at 4, 15, and 30 °C were 98%, 96%, and 94%, respectively. For the interruption of P release, both ZL/NWFM and AC/NWFM were not effective at 4 and 15 °C. At 30 °C, however, AC/NWFM was effective, and its capping efficiencies at 30 °C for PO-P and T-P were 74.0% and 79.9%, respectively.

However, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that an increase in dietary saturated fat could lead to abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and heart rhythm by a NOX2 (NADPH oxidase 2)-dependent mechanism.We investigated this hypothesis by feeding mice high-fat diets. In vivo heart rhythm telemetry, optical mapping, and isolated cardiac myocyte imaging were used to quantify arrhythmias, repolarization, calcium transients, and intracellular calcium sparks.We found that saturated fat activates NOX (NADPH oxidase), whereas polyunsaturated fat does not. The high saturated fat diet increased repolarization heterogeneity and ventricular tachycardia inducibility in perfused hearts. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of NOX2 prevented arrhythmogenic abnormalities in vivo during high statured fat diet and resulted in less inducible ventricular tachycardia. High saturated fat diet activates CaMK (Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) in the heart, which contributes to abnormal calcium handling, promoting arrhythmia.We conclude that NOX2 deletion or pharmacological inhibition prevents the arrhythmogenic effects of a high saturated fat diet, in part mediated by activation of CaMK. This work reveals a molecular mechanism linking cardiac metabolism to arrhythmia and suggests that NOX2 inhibitors could be a novel therapy for heart rhythm abnormalities caused by cardiac lipid overload.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669873>Landfill leachate as an additional substance in the Johannesburg-Sulfur autotrophic denitrification system in the treatment of municipal wastewater with low strength and low COD/TN ratio.</a></h2><p>Johannesburg-Sulfur autotrophic denitrification (JHB-SAD) system was investigated for the combined treatment of leachate and municipal wastewater with low strength and low COD/TN ratio. The average removal efficiencies for chemical  demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were 85.2%, 96.2% and 75.8%, respectively. The municipal wastewater and leachate (dosing of 2.1‰, v/v) can be treated via the JHB-SAD system to achieve efficient nutrients removal. The mass balance calculations suggested that 58.1-69.8% TN was removed in JHB unit and 32.9-41.2% TN in SAD unit. Further, the denitrifying phosphorus removal process occurred in the anoxic zone. EEM-PARAFAC analysis found that the protein-like materials were more efficiently removed than fulvic-like materials in JHB-SAD system. The tryptophan-like materials had the most positive linear relationship with the COD concentrations. The bacterial community was difference between JHB and SAD unit.

A mutation in the SLC34A2 gene in the alveolar Type II pneumocytes is responsible for decreased phosphate clearance and accumulation of calcium as spherules in the alveoli. The presence of this gene in other organs is responsible for the systemic phenotype of the disease. PAM is characterized by the lack of defining symptoms such as cough and progressive dyspnea until it reaches the stage of cor pulmonale and presents with features of respiratory and right ventricular (RV) failure. Radiologically, it is characterized by intense calcification in the lung parenchyma producing specific signs such as the "sandstorm appearance" in the early stages to the "white out lung" with "black pleura sign" in the later stages of the disease. While conventional therapy has not been successful at treatment, bilateral lung transplantation offers to be the only effective remedy. In this report, we present the case of a 54-year-old female who presented in the stage of respiratory and RV failure, with  and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) dependence. She was treated with bilateral lung transplantation. Postoperatively, she was monitored closely for immunosuppression, prophylactic anti-infective measures, and bronchoscopies to evaluate for airway complications.

Three of these complexes were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, [VIVO(PIMH)2], [VIVO(PIMBr)2] and [VIVO(PIMNO2)2], as well as a dioxidovanadium(v) compound ([VVO2(PIMH)(PIMH2)]). The complexes were tested for their catalytic activities in the oxidation of dibenzothiophene (DBT), the major refractory organosulfur compound found in fuel. The nitro substituted compound [VIVO(PIMNO2)2] had the highest catalytic oxidation activity followed by: [VIVO(PIMH)2] > [VIVO(PIMBr)2] > [VIVO(PIMMeO)2]. The decrease in activity is attributed to the different electronegativities of the substituent groups, which influence the electron density on the metal center, the V[double bond, length as m-dash]O bond distances and infrared stretching bands. Geometry index (τ) values calculated from single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) data and DFT studies provided further insights on the trend in activity observed. SC-XRD, EPR, 51V NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopies, and DFT studies were instrumental in studying the mechanism of the catalyzed reaction and proposal of intermediate species. Both radical and non-radical pathways are plausible for the catalytic oxidation and participation of reactive  species in both pathways is also postulated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669668>Protective efficacy of Tinospora sinensis against streptozotocin induced pancreatic islet cell injuries of diabetic rats and its correlation to its phytochemical profiles.</a></h2><p>Tinospora sinensis Lour.

Diabetic rats were administered with METS at a dose of (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg respectively orally) and standard drug Metformin (300 mg/kg) was given orally to group serving positive control. Effect of the METS on glucose homeostasis, oxidative stress, antioxidant status, histopathology of pancreas and also on intracellular reactive  species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis, cell cycleof pancreatic islet cells were studied in diabetic rats.The major phytochemicals identified and quantified by HPLC in the extract were berberine, caffeic acid, myricetin and ferulic acid. This result showed that methanol extract exhibited good antioxidant effect. The methanol extract of the plant prevented the diabetogenic effect of STZ and significantly lowered the fasting blood glucose level, glycated haemoglobin and increased insulin and C-peptide level in treated rats. METS reduced apoptosis of STZ treated islet cells by significantly decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL6), intracellular ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide (NO) production and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential and sub-G peak area, enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants.The results revealed that the methanol extract of the stem of the plant possesses protective effects against diabetes and associated complications.Copyright © 2019.

CGRP exerts a variety of effects within the cardiovascular system, and protects against the onset and development of angiotensin (Ang) II-induced vascular dysfunction and remodelling. However, it is not known whether CGRP has a direct effect on Ang II-induced apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and the mechanism underlying the anti-apoptotic role remains unclear. In this study, CGRP significantly suppressed reactive  species (ROS) and apoptosis in Ang II-induced VSMCs. In VSMCs pre-treated with a CGRP receptor antagonist (CGRP), the CGRP-mediated inhibition of Ang II-induced ROS and apoptosis was completely abolished. Moreover, pre-treatment with N-acetyl-L cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, blocked the effects of CGRP on Ang II-induced apoptosis. In addition, the activation of CaMKII and the downstream transcription factor CREB stimulated by Ang II was abrogated by CGRP. Importantly, in both CGRP and NAC-treated VSMCs, CGRP failed to further attenuate CaMKII and CREB activation. The results demonstrate that CGRP attenuated Ang II-induced ROS-dependent apoptosis in VSMCs by inhibiting the CaMKII/CREB signalling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, an innovative solution was proposed using a three-stage Simultaneous Ammonium oxidation Denitrifying (SAD) process. Firstly, ammonia (1760 ± 126 mg N/L) in wastewater was oxidized to nitrite in a partial nitrification sequencing batch reactor (PN-SBR). Next, 93% PN-SBR effluent and concentrated external waste activated sludge (WAS; MLSS = 23057 ± 6014 mg/L) were introduced to an anoxic reactor for integrated fermentation and denitrification (IFD-SBR). Finally, ammonia (101.4 ± 13.8 mg N/L) released by fermentation in the IFD-SBR and residual 7% nitrite in the PN-SBR were removed through the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process in the SAD up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (SAD-UASB). In addition, NO-N generation during the anammox process could be reduced to nitrite by partial denitrification (PD) and reused as substrate for anammox. A satisfactory total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency (98.3%), external sludge reduction rate (2.5 kg/m d) and effluent TN concentration (16.7 mg/L) were achieved after long-term operation (280 days). The IFD-SBR and SAD-UASB contributed to 81.9% and 12.3% nitrogen removal, respectively. Microbial analysis showed that anammox bacteria (1.5% Candidatus Brocadia) cooperated well with partial denitrifying bacteria (4.3% Thauera) in SAD-UASB, and average nitrogen removal contribution were 83.1% during significant stability of anammox and 9.2% during the denitrification process, respectively. The three-stage SAD process provides an environmental and economic approach for landfill leachate treatment since it has the advantage of 25.4% less , 100% organic matter savings and 47.9% less external sludge than traditional biological processes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Total 60 cases were considered in the study that involves 30 hypertensive patients and 30 normal control. Measurements of serum concentrations of TNF-α, MDA, FRAP in hypertension patients was done in both the groups. Serum TNF-α was found to be remarkably increased in study subjects as compared to normal group (r=0.32, p<0.0001*). Serum MDA was also raised in hypertensive as compared to control (r=0.99**, p<0.0001*). While Serum FRAP was found to be decreased in hypertensive group in comparison to healthy control (r=0.23, p<0.0001*). It is concluded that high blood pressure leads to generation of oxidative stress with remarkable elevation of TNF-α and malondialdehyde levels.

However, the cost of advanced treatments is proportional to the concentration of the pollutant. Therefore, improved bio-treatment efficiency is the key to reduce the treatment cost of MSWI leachate. In this study, the up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) -modified Bardenpho process was used for the treatment of MSWI leachate. The results showed that it was feasible to dilute the leachate by recirculation of the settling tank effluent, which has great significance in the bio-treatment efficiency. The treatment process achieved removal efficiencies of COD and NH-N of 97.5-99.5% and 99.3-99.7%, respectively. Adjustments to the operational conditions of the primary anoxic tank, such as adding an organic carbon source and increasing the hydraulic retention time and the nitrification reflux ratio resulted in a TN removal efficiency of 97.7-98.7%. Controlling the generation of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and increasing its removal efficiency significantly improved the TN removal efficiency. The concentrations of NH-N and TN in the settling tank effluent complied with the local leachate discharge standard, which minimized the cost of advanced treatment. The results provide new ideas for enhancing the bio-treatment efficiency of leachate and theoretical and technical support for reducing the cost of treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Research suggests hyperbaric  therapy improves healing of these ulcers. However, this has not been reflected in previous reviews, possibly because they did not differentiate between patients with and without peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of published literature in the MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL databases on non-ischemic diabetic foot ulcers with outcome measures including complete ulcer healing, amputation rate (major and minor) and mortality. Seven studies were included, of which two were randomized clinical trials. Two studies found no difference in major amputation rate, whereas one large retrospective study found 2% more major amputations in the hyperbaric  group. However, this study did not correct for baseline differences. Two studies showed no significant difference in minor amputation rate. Five studies reporting on complete wound healing showed no significant differences. In conclusion, the current evidence suggests that hyperbaric  therapy does not accelerate wound healing and does not prevent major or minor amputations in patients with a diabetic foot ulcer without peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Based on the available evidence, routine clinical use of this therapy cannot be recommended. However, the available research for this specific subgroup of patients is scarce, and physicians should counsel patients on expected risks and benefits. Additional research, focusing especially on patient selection criteria, is needed to better identify patients that might profit from this therapy modality. This article is protected by copyright.

Here we describe the properties of Soyuretox, a polypeptide derived from soybean () ubiquitous urease. Soyuretox was fungitoxic to , leading to the production of reactive  species. Soyuretox further induced aggregation of  hemocytes, indicating an interference on the insect immune response. No relevant toxicity of Soyuretox to zebrafish larvae was observed. These data suggest the presence of antifungal and entomotoxic portions of the amino acid sequences encompassing both Soyuretox and Jaburetox, despite their small sequence identity. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic data revealed that Soyuretox, in analogy with Jaburetox, possesses an intrinsic and largely disordered nature. Some folding is observed upon interaction of Soyuretox with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles, taken here as models for membranes. This observation suggests the possibility for this protein to modify its secondary structure upon interaction with the cells of the affected organisms, leading to alterations of membrane integrity.

TBD-anchor showed superefficient antibacterial performance towards both Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus). Over 99.8% killing efficiency was obtained for Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) when they were exposed to 0.8 μM of TBD-anchor at a low white light dose (25 mW/cm2) for 10 minutes. TBD-anchor thus shows great promise as an effective antimicrobial agent to combat the menace of multidrug-resistant bacteria.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Triticonazole is a triazole fungicide that is used for turf protection, residential, and other commercial applications. As such, it can enter local rural and urban water systems via run-off and rain events. Early life stages of aquatic organisms can be susceptible to pesticides that enter the water, but in the case of triticonazole, data on the potential for subacute toxicity are lacking. Here, we determined the effects of triticonazole on development,  consumption rates, and locomotor activity in zebrafish to address this knowledge gap. Wild-type zebrafish (ABTu strain) embryos and larvae were exposed to triticonazole (1-100 μM) in early development for different lengths of time depending on the assay conducted. Triticonazole did not affect survival nor induce significant deformity (pericardial edema, skeletal defects) in zebrafish at doses up to 100 μM.  consumption rate was measured in embryos after 24 and 48 hour exposure to triticonazole beginning at ∼6 hpf using the XF flux analyzer. Triticonazole did not affect basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP linked respiration, FCCP-induced maximum respiration, proton leak, spare capacity, nor non-mitochondrial respiration at doses up to 100 μM for 24 hours, even for exposure up to 250 μM for 48 hours. To determine whether the fungicide affected larval swimming activity, the visual motor response test was conducted following triticonazole exposure for 6 days. Larval zebrafish exposed to triticonazole showed hypoactivity in the dark following a 100 μM treatment, suggesting that the fungicide can affect the locomotor activity of zebrafish, albeit at relatively high levels. Given the fact that sublethal biological responses were absent at lower environmentally relevant concentrations, we conclude that triticonazole, relative to other triazole fungicides and types of pesticides, exhibits a relatively low risk of toxicity to the early life stages of fish.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666212>Experimental approaches for identifying the impact of enhanced flotation technology using hollow microspheres.</a></h2><p>Hollow microspheres should be characterized in terms of physicochemical aspects to understand the flotation effect principle. There have been insufficient studies on the effect of hollow microspheres in water treatment in terms of flotation. In this study, various analytical and experimental approaches were utilized to identify the flotation characteristics and understand the effect of hollow microspheres on flotation. These approaches included analytical methods such as particle count and zeta potential measurements, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, a floc breakage experiment, and a collision efficiency model. The hollow microspheres were spherical shape with an average size of 50 μm. The microspheres were identified to have a higher negative charge (-69.1 mV) than microbubbles (-51.1 and -30.5 mV). The binding energy of Si-O from the hollow microspheres showed the highest peak at 103.18 eV and 61,503.7 counts/s. Si-O binding structure and the molecular structure of the SiO series were considered to be a structure in which Si is bonded to  ion. The optimum floc breakage condition was determined to be 15 min. The number of particles increased because the average particle size is increased with the concentration of hollow microspheres injection. The turbulent flocculation (TF) model was confirmed to be consentient to the experimental data in comparison with the white-water bubble blanket (WWBB) model. As a result, the hollow microspheres had the characteristic of increasing floc size so that flocs can be floated easily.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Icariin has been shown to exert a protective effect on human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and accordingly has implications for the prevention and treatment of IVDD; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its action are not fully established. In this study, the mechanisms underlying its protection against hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced oxidative stress injury were investigated. In vitro, we demonstrated that icariin inhibits HO-induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. It upregulates oxidative stress mediators, i.e., reactive  species, and downregulates mitochondrial membrane potential. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) is a key factor involved in the regulation of the endogenous defense system. It was proved that icariin could activate the Nrf-2 signaling pathway, upregulate the protein expression of nuclear respiratory factor-1 and the mitochondrial transcription factor, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis in human NP cells. An Nrf-2 agonist and inhibitor promoted or partly abolished the protective effects of icariin on mitochondrial homeostasis. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the Nrf-2 signaling pathway could be inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/AKT pathway. In vivo, icariin ameliorated IVDD in a rat model by promoting Nrf-2 activity, and preserving extracellular matrix in NP cells. These data suggest that icariin could ameliorate IVDD in rat models in vivo. In summary, the protective effects of icariin on human NP cells may suppress the pathogenesis of IVDD via the Nrf-2 signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that the Nrf-2 signaling pathway is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of IVDD.Copyright © 2019.

Ketamine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist has beneficial effects in pilocarpine-induced temporal lobe epilepsy, when administered within minutes of seizure to avoid the harmful neurological lesions induced by pilocarpine. However, the enzymes involved in ROS productions and the effect of ketamine on this process remain less documented. Here we show that during pilocarpine-induced epilepsy in mice, the expression of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase NOX2 subunits (NOX2/gp91, p22, and p47) and the expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were dramatically increased in mice brain treated with pilocarpine. Interestingly, treatment of mice with ketamine before or after pilocarpine administration decreased this process, mainly when injected before pilocarpine. Finally, our results showed that pilocarpine induced p47 phosphorylation and HO production in mice brain and ketamine was able to inhibit these processes. Our results show that pilocarpine induced NOX2 activation to produce ROS in mice brain and that administration of ketamine before or after the induction of temporal lobe epilepsy by pilocarpine inhibited this activation in mice brain. These results suggest a key role of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase NOX2 and MPO in epilepsy and identify a novel effect of ketamine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672529>Branchial bioenergetics dysfunction as a relevant pathophysiological mechanism in freshwater silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) experimentally infected with Flavobacterium columnare.</a></h2><p>Flavobacterium columnare, the causative agent of columnaris disease, is a serious bacterial disease responsible for causing devastating mortality rates in several species of freshwater fish, leading to severe economic losses in the aquaculture industry. Notwithstanding the enormous impacts this disease can have, very little is known regarding the interaction between the host and bacterium in terms of the mortality rate of silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen), as well its linkage to gill energetic homeostasis. Therefore, we conducted independent experiments to evaluate the mortality rates caused by F. columnare in silver catfish, as well as whether columnaris disease impairs the enzymes of the phosphoryl transfer network in gills of silver catfish and the pathways involved in this inhibition. Experiment I revealed that clinical signs started to appear 72 h post-infection (hpi), manifesting as lethargy, skin necrosis, fin erosion and gill discoloration. Silver catfish began to die at 96 hpi, and 100% mortality was observed at 120 hpi. Experiment II revealed that creatine kinase (CK, cytosolic and mitochondrial) and pyruvate kinase (PK) activities were inhibited in silver catfish experimentally infected with F. columnare, while no significant difference was observed between experimental and control groups with respect to adenylate kinase activity. Activity of the branchial sodium-potassium pump (Na, K-ATPase) was inhibited while reactive  species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation levels were higher in silver catfish experimentally infected with F. columnare than in the control group at 72 hpi. Based on these data, the impairment of CK activity elicited by F. columnare caused a disruption in branchial energetic balance, possibly reducing ATP availability in the gills and provoking impairment of Na, K ATPase activity. The inhibition of CK and PK activities appears to be mediated by ROS overproduction and lipid peroxidation, both of which contribute to disease pathogenesis associated with branchial tissue.Copyright © 2019.

No prior research exists on the efficiency of advanced oxidations processes (AOPs) in treating pisco vinasse. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the efficiency of ultraviolet (UV), ultrasound (US), US + UV, heterogeneous photocatalysis (HP), and HP + US treatments. Polyphenols, COD, and color removal, as well as oxidation-reduction potential, were monitored over a 60-minute treatment period. Energy consumption levels and synergies were also calculated. The HP + US treatment achieved the best removal ratios for polyphenols (68%), COD (70%), and color (48%). While the HP treatment was the second most efficient in terms of polyphenols (62%), COD (58%), and color (40%) removal, this AOP comparatively required the least amount of energy. Considering the energy efficiency and relatively high pollutant-removal rates of the HP treatment, this AOP is recommended as a practical alternative for treating pisco vinasse.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report that Co-Pi nanoparticle with low-coordinated Co ions and doped nitrogen atoms could be decorated on hematite nanorod arrays to form N-CoPi/Hematite composites. Moreover, the local atomic configuration and bond distance studies show that trivalent Co3+ states are partially reduced through nitrogen radicals in the plasma to low-coordinated bivalent Co2+ states playing as the facile adsorption sites of -evolving intermediates due to the decreased activation barrier for water oxidation. Electron transport is also reinforced by nitrogen species due to the formation of hybridizing N 2p orbitals that give the acceptor levels in the bandgap. As a result, both the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency and also the charge transfer resistance on N-CoPi/Hematite outperform those on a bare hematite by about three folds. Furthermore, N-CoPi/hematite gives high activity retention over 90% after the long operation of water oxidation, supporting that the reaction sites on N-CoPi do not degrade during the successive water oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671182>The role of A-kinase anchoring proteins in cardiac oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Cardiac stress initiates a pathological remodeling process that is associated with cardiomyocyte loss and fibrosis that ultimately leads to heart failure. In the injured heart, a pathologically elevated synthesis of reactive  species (ROS) is the main driver of oxidative stress and consequent cardiomyocyte dysfunction and death. In this context, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) plays a central role in regulating signaling pathways that protect the heart against ROS-induced cardiac damage. In cardiac cells, spatiotemporal regulation of PKA activity is controlled by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). This family of scaffolding proteins tether PKA and other transduction enzymes at subcellular microdomains where they can co-ordinate cellular responses regulating oxidative stress. In this review, we will discuss recent literature illustrating the role of PKA and AKAPs in modulating the detrimental impact of ROS production on cardiac function.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673742>High c-di-GMP promotes expression of fpr-1 and katE involved in oxidative stress resistance in Pseudomonas putida KT2440.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of interactions with various reactive  species (ROS)-inducing agents that would damage cells or even cause cell death. Bacteria have developed defensive systems, including induction of stress-sensing proteins and detoxification enzymes, to handle oxidative stress. Cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) is a ubiquitous intracellular bacterial second messenger that coordinates diverse aspects of bacterial growth and behavior. In this study, we revealed a mechanism by which c-di-GMP regulated bacterial oxidative stress resistance in Pseudomonas putida KT2440. High c-di-GMP level was found to enhance bacterial resistance towards hydrogen peroxide. Transcription assay showed that expression of two oxidative stress resistance genes, fpr-1 and katE, was promoted under high c-di-GMP level. Deletion of fpr-1 and katE both decreased bacterial tolerance to hydrogen peroxide and weakened the effect of c-di-GMP on oxidative stress resistance. The promoted expression of fpr-1 under high c-di-GMP level was caused by increased cellular ROS via a transcriptional regulator FinR. We further demonstrated that the influence of high c-di-GMP on cellular ROS depend on the existence of FleQ, a transcriptional regulatory c-di-GMP effector. Besides, the regulation of katE by c-di-GMP was also FleQ dependent in an indirect way. Our results proved a connection between c-di-GMP and oxidative stress resistance and revealed a mechanism by which c-di-GMP regulated expression of fpr-1 and katE in P. putida KT2440.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673193>Youth cardiorespiratory fitness: evidence, myths and misconceptions.</a></h2><p>Rigorously determined peak  uptake is internationally recognized as the criterion measure of youth cardiorespiratory fitness.

There has been a recent resurgence of interest in the prediction of peak  uptake from field performance tests in young people. However, coupled with ratio-scaling of data and the raising of clinical red flags, these practices risk clouding our understanding of youth cardiorespiratory fitness and its relationship with current and future health. We believe these methods have the potential to mislead clinical practice and misguide recommendations for the promotion of youth cardiovascular health. We discuss relevant scientific evidence and interpretations that have emerged from predicting youth cardiorespiratory fitness from performance test scores.

We developed an optoacoustic tomography approach for real-time imaging through entire ~4 cm cross-sections of pregnant mice. Functional changes in both maternal and embryo regions were studied at different gestation days when subjected to an  breathing challenge and perfusion with indocyanine green. Structural phenotyping of the cross-sectional scans highlighted different internal organs, whereas multi-wavelength acquisitions enabled non-invasive label-free spectroscopic assessment of blood-oxygenation parameters in foeto-placental regions, rendering a strong correlation with the amount of  administered. Likewise, the placental function in protecting the embryo from extrinsically administered agents was substantiated. The proposed methodology may potentially further serve as a probing mechanism to appraise embryo development during pregnancy in the clinical setting.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672919>Detection, identification and quantification of oxidative protein modifications.</a></h2><p>Exposure of biological molecules to oxidants is inevitable and therefore commonplace. Oxidative stress in cells arises from both external agents and endogenous processes that generate reactive species, either purposely (e.g. during pathogen killing or enzymatic reactions) or accidently (e.g. exposure to radiation, pollutants, drugs, or chemicals). As proteins are highly abundant and react rapidly with many oxidants, they are highly susceptible to, and major targets of, oxidative damage. This can result in changes to protein structure, function, and turnover and to loss or (occasional) gain of activity. Accumulation of oxidatively modified proteins, due to either increased generation or decreased removal, has been associated with both aging and multiple diseases. Different oxidants generate a broad, and sometimes characteristic, spectrum of post-translational modifications. The kinetics (rates) of damage formation also vary dramatically. There is a pressing need for reliable and robust methods that can detect, identify, and quantify the products formed on amino acids, peptides, and proteins, especially in complex systems. This review summarizes several advances in our understanding of this complex chemistry and highlights methods that are available to detect oxidative modifications-at the amino acid, peptide, or protein level-and their nature, quantity, and position within a peptide sequence. Although considerable progress has been made in the development and application of new techniques, it is clear that further development is required to fully assess the relative importance of protein oxidation and to determine whether an oxidation is a cause, or merely a consequence, of injurious processes.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669487>Role of the two PsaE isoforms on O reduction at photosystem I in Arabidopsis thaliana.</a></h2><p>Leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in short days (8 h light) generate more reactive  species in the light than leaves of plants grown in long days (16 h light). The importance of the two PsaE isoforms of photosystem I, PsaE1 and PsaE2, for O reduction was studied in plants grown under these different growth regimes. In short day conditions a mutant affected in the amount of PsaE1 (psae1-1) reduced more efficiently O than a mutant lacking PsaE2 (psae2-1) as shown by spin trapping EPR spectroscopy on leaves and by following the kinetics of P700 reduction in isolated photosystem I. In short day conditions higher O reduction protected photosystem II against photoinhibition in psae1-1. In contrast in long day conditions the presence of PsaE1 was clearly beneficial for photosynthetic electron transport and for the stability of the photosynthetic apparatus under photoinhibitory conditions. We conclude that the two PsaE isoforms have distinct functions and we propose that O reduction at photosystem I is beneficial for the plant under certain environmental conditions.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, the major and trace element contents of the Salda Lake water were analysed in two periods. Lake water samples were taken at the surface, at 10 m and 20 m depths. The pH and EC values of the lake water varied from 9.08 to 9.34 and from 1690 to 2124 μS/cm, respectively. The dominant water type of the lake water was Mg-CO-HCO. The high Mg content in the lake water originated from the weathering of ultramafic rocks which were located in the lake basin. All of the Ca, Cl and SO contents were high in surface samples in the dry period. The CO and HCO contents of the lake water did not show a change with depth and were constant in the wet period. The Mg, Na and K contents of the lake water increased depending on the depth in both periods, while CO and HCO contents showed depth-dependent increases only in the dry period. Weathering processes and anthropogenic inputs are the largest dissolution mechanisms that control the chemical structure of the lake water.

This study aimed to investigate whether cortical neuron-released exosomal microRNA-181c-3p (miR-181c-3p) affected ischemic brain injury (IBI).An IBI rat model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Astrocytes collected from rats were exposed to exosomes derived from cortical neurons to investigate the effect of exosomes on chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) expression and inflammatory response. Then, ectopic expression was induced in astrocytes treated with  and glucose deprivation (OGD).CXCL1 was identified to be an upregulated gene in IBI by microarray-based gene expression profiling. Additionally, upregulation of CXCL1 and promoted inflammatory response was also found in MCAO rats. miR-181c-3p was downregulated in OGD-treated cortical neurons and exosomes derived from OGD-treated cortical neurons. Exosomes derived from OGD-treated cortical neurons decreased the expression of CXCL1 and inflammatory factors in astrocytes, and exosomes delivered miR-181c-3p to decrease CXCL1 expression in astrocytes. CXCL1 was a target gene of miR-181c-3p. Delivery with miR-181c-3p mimic and siRNA against CXCL1 (si-CXCL1) was shown to inhibit inflammation in astrocytes by downregulating CXCL1.Collectively, exosomal miR-181c-3p derived from cortical neurons exerts protective effects on neuroinflammation in astrocytes via downregulation of CXCL1 in an IBI rat model.© 2019 S.

Thymol acts via its potential to enhance productive and reproductive performance, and by improving bioavailability of nutrients in fish. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms associated with these phenomena remain poorly understood, although recent evidence has suggested the involvement of the phosphotransfer network and antioxidant status. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether the improvement of the antioxidant/oxidant status and the phosphoryl transfer network may be involved in enhanced growth performance in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) fed with various levels of thymol (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed). Thymol-supplementation (100 mg/kg feed) produced higher body weight and weight gain for 60-day post-feeding compared to the control group. Specific growth rate was higher; while feed conversion ratio was lower in fish that consumed 100 mg of thymol/kg compared to other groups. Hepatic lactate dehydrogenase activity and lipid peroxidation levels were lower in the thymol-supplemented group (100 mg/kg feed) than in the control group, while reactive  species were lower in all supplemented groups than in the control group. Hepatic superoxide dismutase (300 mg/kg feed) and glutathione peroxidase (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed) activities, as well as antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (100 mg/kg feed) were higher in these groups than in the control group.

Compromising heparan sulfate synthesis increased autophagy-dependent processes, evident by extended lifespan, increased resistance to ROS, and reduced accumulation of ubiquitin-modified proteins in the brains of ROS exposed adults. The capacity of altering heparan sulfate biosynthesis to protect cells from injury was also evaluated in two different models of neurodegeneration, overexpression of Presenilin and mutants.

When the influent TS concentration increased from 7.04 to 15.5 g/L, the methane gas production rate increased from 0.45 to 0.92 L-CH/L/day. However, with the influent TS concentration of food waste (FW) further increased to 23.5 g/L, a large amount of scum formed and accumulated in the SDSAR. According to the result of chemical  demand (COD) recovery, the proportion of COD remained in the effluent at different TS concentrations was only around 2%. On the other hand, with an increase in TS concentration, the proportion of COD remained in the reactors increased significantly. Our results demonstrated that effluent from the integrated system can meet the water quality requirements recommended by Japan Sewage Works Association (JSWA) for wastewater from FWD. In addition, to enhance the process stability, the influent TS concentration should be maintained below 15.5 g/L.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673996>Brain transcriptome profile after CRISPR-induced ghrelin mutations in zebrafish.</a></h2><p>Ghrelin (GRL) is a gut-brain hormone with a role in a wide variety of physiological functions in mammals and fish, which points out the ghrelinergic system as a key element for the appropriate biological functioning of the organism. However, many aspects of the multifunctional nature of GRL remain to be better explored, especially in fish. In this study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique to generate F0 zebrafish in which the expression of grl is compromised. Then, we employed high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to explore changes in the brain transcriptome landscape associated with the silencing of grl. The CRISPR/Cas9 technique successfully edited the genome of F0 zebrafish resulting in individuals with considerably lower levels of GRL mRNAs and protein and ghrelin O-acyl transferase (goat) mRNAs in the brain, intestine, and liver compared to wild-type (WT) zebrafish. Analysis of brain transcriptome revealed a total of 1360 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the grl knockdown (KD) and WT zebrafish, with 664 up- and 696 downregulated DEGs in the KD group. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs are highly enriched for terms related to morphogenesis, metabolism (especially of lipids), entrainment of circadian clocks,  transport, apoptosis, and response to stimulus. The present study offers valuable information on the central genes and pathways implicated in functions of GRL, and points out the possible involvement of this peptide in some novel functions in fish, such as apoptosis and  transport.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670864>NF-E2-related factor 2 activation boosts antioxidant defenses and ameliorates inflammatory and amyloid properties in human Presenilin-1 mutated Alzheimer's disease astrocytes.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common dementia affecting a vast number of individuals and significantly impairing quality of life. Despite extensive research in animal models and numerous promising treatment trials, there is still no curative treatment for AD. Astrocytes, the most common cell type of the central nervous system, have been shown to play a role in the major AD pathologies, including accumulation of amyloid plaques, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Here, we show that inflammatory stimulation leads to metabolic activation of human astrocytes and reduces amyloid secretion. On the other hand, the activation of oxidative metabolism leads to increased reactive  species production especially in AD astrocytes. While healthy astrocytes increase glutathione (GSH) release to protect the cells, Presenilin-1-mutated AD patient astrocytes do not. Thus, chronic inflammation is likely to induce oxidative damage in AD astrocytes. Activation of NRF2, the major regulator of cellular antioxidant defenses, encoded by the NFE2L2 gene, poses several beneficial effects on AD astrocytes. We report here that the activation of NRF2 pathway reduces amyloid secretion, normalizes cytokine release, and increases GSH secretion in AD astrocytes. NRF2 induction also activates the metabolism of astrocytes and increases the utilization of glycolysis. Taken together, targeting NRF2 in astrocytes could be a potent therapeutic strategy in AD.© 2019 The Authors.

The widespread occurrence and persistence of steroid hormones have attracted public attention due to their endocrine-disrupting effects on both wildlife and human beings. Bacteria are responsible for mineralizing steroids from the biosphere. Aerobic degradation of steroid hormones relies on O as a co-substrate of oxygenases to activate and to cleave the recalcitrant steroidal core ring. To date, two -dependent degradation pathways - the 9,10-seco pathway for androgens and the 4,5-seco pathways for oestrogens - have been characterized. Under anaerobic conditions, denitrifying bacteria adopt the 2,3-seco pathway to degrade different steroid structures. Recent meta-omics revealed that microorganisms able to degrade steroids are highly diverse and ubiquitous in different ecosystems. This review also summarizes culture-independent approaches using the characteristic metabolites and catabolic genes to monitor steroid biodegradation in various ecosystems.© 2019 The Authors.

Due to the high graphitic degree and built-in few-layer nanotubes, the as-synthesized carbonaceous materials possess a higher catalytic ozonation activity than that of the state-of-the-art carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and LaMnO perovskite catalysts for the destruction of different aqueous contaminants. For recalcitrant oxalic acid removal, 50 mg L oxalic acid was completely degraded in 20 min. Compared with other nanocarbons, the as-synthesized materials also demonstrated robust structural stability and reusability. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and selective radical quenching tests revealed that the destruction of the aqueous organics predominantly relied on surface-adsorbed complexes (O* and O*) from activated ozone molecules. Owing to the occurrence of this surface oxidation pathway, the compatibility of the CPGs/O system was significantly enhanced for treatment of real wastewater, where the inorganic anions and organic natural organic matter would inhibit radical oxidation as radical scavengers. Furthermore, by employing organics with different ionization potentials (IPs) as the target pollutants, the CPGs/O system was discovered to obtain a high oxidation potential.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, there are currently limited data concerning the prevalence of OSA in populations that originate from developing countries; the prevalence of OSA is expected to rise in these countries. OSA is poorly characterized amongst Ethiopians, and our study is the first to describe clinical characteristics of OSA among Ethiopians.We conducted a retrospective study of primarily Ethiopian patients at an internal medicine clinic in Rockville, Maryland. All patients (n=24) were evaluated for daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and received physical examinations and polysomnograms (PSG) by either portable monitoring (Itamar WatchPAT 200 device) or in-lab. Statistical analyses were performed in R.Linear regression model of Body-Mass Index (BMI) and Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) indicated that for every 1-unit increase in BMI, there was a 0.8657-unit increase in AHI (p<0.05). Pearson's correlation coefficient indicateda positive linear relationship between BMI and AHI (0.47) (p<0.05). Adjusted linear regression model for AHI and  saturation indicated that for every 1-unit increase of AHI, there was a 0.8452-unit decrease in nocturnal  saturation (p<0.05). Pearson's correlation coefficient did not demonstrate significance between AHI and  desaturation (p=0.062). Patients received either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (n=15) or oral appliance therapy (n=3).All patients who complied with therapy reported improved sleep quality, snoring resolution, and improved daytime alertness. Practitioners in developing countries should suspect OSA in the right clinical setting and offer diagnostic and therapeutic services when available.© 2019 Asefa Mekonnen, et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670523>Total Synthesis of Alvaradoins E and F, Uveoside, and 10-epi-Uveoside.</a></h2><p>Concise total syntheses of the anthracenone -glycosides alvaradoins E and F, uveoside, and 10-epi-uveoside (-) have been accomplished from chrysophanic acid  and bromosugar .

In awake animals, exploiting intrinsic signal optical imaging, Doppler optical coherence tomography, and two-photon microscopy, we investigate how the progression of atherosclerotic disease affects the morphology and function of cortical microvasculature as well as baseline cerebral tissue oxygenation. Results show that aged ATX mice exhibited weaker hemodynamic response in the somatosensory cortex to whisker stimulation and that the diameter of their descending arterioles and associated mean blood flow decreased significantly compared with the young ATX group. Data from two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy indicate that old ATX mice had lower and more heterogeneous partial pressure of  (  ) in cortical tissue than young ATX mice. In addition, hypoxic micropockets in cortical tissue were found in old, but not young, ATX mice. Capillary red blood cell (RBC) flux, RBC velocity, RBC velocity heterogeneity, hematocrit, and diameter were also measured using line scans with two-photon fluorescence microscopy. When compared with the young group, RBC flux, velocity, and hematocrit decreased and RBC velocity heterogeneity increased in old ATX mice, presumably due to disturbed blood supply from arterioles that were affected by atherosclerosis. Finally, dilation of capillaries in old ATX mice was observed, which suggests that capillaries play an active role in compensating for an  deficit in brain tissue.© The Authors.

The utility of endostatin as a risk marker for mortality in the emergency department (ED) has not been reported.Our main aim was to study the association between plasma endostatin and 90-day mortality in an unselected cohort of patients admitted to the ED for acute dyspnea. Design Circulating endostatin was analyzed in plasma from 1710 adults and related to 90-day mortality in Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index,  saturation, respiratory rate, body temperature, C-reactive protein, lactate, creatinine and medical priority according to the Medical Emergency Triage and Treatment System-Adult score (METTS-A). The predictive value of endostatin for mortality was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and compared with the clinical triage scoring system and age.Each one standard deviation increment of endostatin was associated with a HR of 2.12 (95 % CI 1.31-3.44 p< 0.01) for 90-day mortality after full adjustment. Levels of endostatin were significantly increased in the group of patients with highest METTS-A (p<0.001).

Here, the role of chemical composition, architecture, and fixation on the ecotoxicological effects on microalgae of different ZnO and ZnO@ZnS based water decontamination photocatalysts was analyzed in depth. In particular, the ecotoxicological effects of films, nanoparticles and biomimetic micro/nano-ferns were carefully assessed by correlating the algae's viability to the Zn(II) release, the photocatalyst-microalgae interaction, and the production of reactive  species (ROS). The results showed a drastic improvement in algal viability for supported ZnO@ZnS core@shell micro/nanoferns, as their ecotoxicity after 96 h light exposure was significantly lower (3.7-10.0% viability loss) compared to the ZnO films (18.4-35.5% loss), ZnO micro/nanoferns (28.5-53.5% loss), ZnO nanoparticles (48.3-91.7% loss) or ZnO@ZnS nanoparticles (8.6-19.2% loss) for catalysts concentrations ranging from 25 mg L to 400 mg L. In particular, the ZnO@ZnS micro/nanoferns with a concentration of 400 mg L exhibited excellent photocatalytic efficiency to mineralize a multi-pollutant solution (81.4 ± 0.3% mineralization efficiency after 210 min under UV-filtered visible light irradiation) and minimal photocorrosion (<5% of photocatalyst dissolution after 96 h of UV-filtered visible light irradiation). Remarkably, the ZnO@ZnS micro/nanoferns showed lower loss of algal viability (9.8 ± 1.1%) after 96 h of light exposure, with minimal reduction in microalgal biomass (9.1 ± 1.0%), as well as in the quantity of chlorophyll-a (9.5 ± 1.0%), carotenoids (8.6 ± 0.9%) and phycocyanin (5.6 ± 0.6%). Altogether, the optimized ZnO@ZnS core@shell micro/nanoferns represent excellent ecofriendly photocatalysts for water remediation in complex media, as they combine enhanced sunlight remediation efficiency, minimal adverse effects on biological microorganisms, high reusability and easy recyclability.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This synthetic pyrazolone derivative is a potent scavenger of  free radicals and also functions as a modulator of transcription factors, repressing NFκB and activating Nrf2, to regulate oxidative stress. EDA displays complementary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The injectable small molecule is currently investigated for the treatment of several non-neurological diseases. The potential interest of EDA in oncology is reviewed here. EDA is a mild antiproliferative agent but has been found to enhance significantly the anticancer and antimetastatic activities of irinotecan in a colon cancer model. Anticancer derivatives of EDA have been designed but they generally display a limited antiproliferative activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of EDA can be best exploited to protect non-tumor cells from damages induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and radiations. Notably EDA can reduce the renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin, the neurotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon treatment with EDA, a significant improvement in neurologic symptoms has been observed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. The drug could be used to limit radiation-induced brain injury or oral mucositis. EDA was found to ameliorate autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), which is a frequent side effect observed after treatment of cancer patients with monoclonal antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint PD-1. Therefore, EDA could also be useful to reduce specific side effects of immuno-therapy. Collectively, the information suggests that the medical use of EDA, a drug with a proven safety after 18 years of use in brain-related Human diseases, could be extended to cancer-related conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The first was training and acclimatization session, then an experimental lifting phase. A total of ten male students of King Saud University were recruited in the study. A four-way repeated measures design, with four independent variables and six dependent variables, was used in this research. The independent variables that were studied in the experimental lifting phase were: ambient  content (15%, 18%, and 21%), safety shoes type (light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty), lifting frequency (1 and 4 lifts/min), and replication (first and second trials). The dependent variables were also: maximum acceptable weights lifting using the psychophysical technique, heart rate (HR), electromyography (EMG) of (biceps brachii, trapezius, anterior deltoid, and erector spinae), safety shoes discomfort rating, rating of perceived exertion, and ambient  discomfort rating.The maximum acceptable weights lifting that were selected by participants at lower levels of the independent variables (ambient  content 21%, lifting frequency 1 lift/min, and first replication) were significantly higher than at high levels of the independent variables (ambient  content 15%, lifting frequency 4 lift/min, and second replication). Several interaction effects were also significant.It provides evidence that the ambient  content increases the intensity of workload in lifting tasks. It showed that  content affects the psychophysical selection of maximum acceptable weights lifting and the physiological responses represented in muscular activities and heart rate. It suggests that ambient  content must be considered along with the type of safety shoes worn when the lifting task at altitudes occurs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673822>Abiotic environmental factors override phytoplankton succession in shaping both free-living and attached bacterial communities in a highland lake.</a></h2><p>Bacterial communities are an important part of biological diversity and biogeochemical cycling in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, the relationship amongst the phytoplankton species composition and abiotic environmental factors on seasonal changes in the community composition of free-living and attached bacteria in Lake Erhai were studied. Using Illumina high-throughput sequencing, we found that the impact of environmental factors on both the free-living and attached bacterial community composition was greater than that of the phytoplankton community, amongst which total phosphorus, Secchi disk, water temperature, dissolved  and conductivity strongly influenced bacterial community composition. Microcystis blooms associated with subdominant Psephonema occurred during the summer and autumn, and Fragilaria, Melosira and Mougeotia were found at high densities in the other seasons. Only small numbers of algal species-specific bacteria, including Xanthomonadaceae (Proteobacteria) and Alcaligenaceae (Betaproteobacteria), were tightly coupled to Microcystis and Psephonema during Microcystis blooms. Redundancy analysis showed that although the composition of the bacterial communities was controlled by species composition mediated by changes in phytoplankton communities and abiotic environmental factors, the impact of the abiotic environment on both free-living and attached bacterial community compositions were greater than the impact of the phytoplankton community. These results suggest that the species composition of both free-living and attached bacterial communities are affected by abiotic environmental factors, even when under strong control by biotic factors, particularly dominant genera of Microcystis and Psephonema during algal blooms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669661>Betula utilis extract prolongs life expectancy, protects against amyloid-β toxicity and reduces Alpha Synuclien in Caenorhabditis elegans via DAF-16 and SKN-1.</a></h2><p>Betula utilis (BU), an important medicinal plant that grows in high altitudes of the Himalayan region, has been utilized traditionally due to it's antibacterial, hepatoprotective, and anti-tumor properties. Here, we demonstrated the longevity and amyloid-β toxicity attenuating activity of B. utilis ethanolic extract (BUE) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Lifespan of the worms was observed under both the standard laboratory and stress (oxidative and thermal) conditions. Effect of BUE was also observed on the attenuation of age-dependent physiological parameters. Further, gene-specific mutants and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged strains were used to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the beneficial effects mediated by BUE supplementation. Our results showed that BUE (50 μg/ml) extended the mean lifespan of C. elegans by 35.99% and increased its survival under stress conditions. The BUE also reduced the levels of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) by 22.47%. A delayed amyloid-β induced paralyses was observed in CL4176 transgenic worms. Interestingly, the BUE supplementation was also able to reduce the α-synuclein aggregation in NL5901 transgenic strain. Gene-specific mutant studies suggested that the BUE-mediated lifespan extension was dependent on daf-16, hsf-1, and skn-1 but not on sir-2.1 gene. Furthermore, transgenic reporter gene expression assay showed that BUE treatment enhanced the expression of stress-protective genes such as sod-3 and gst-4. Present findings suggested that ROS scavenging activity, together with multiple longevity mechanisms, were involved in BUE-mediated lifespan extension. Thus, BUE might have potential to increase the lifespan and to attenuate neuro-related disease progression.Copyright © 2019.

This study proposes a theoretical model that elucidated the effects of ROL on microbial oxidation of CH to understand landfill gas transportation and oxidation in landfill cover soils. Parametric analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of root depth, root architecture, and ROL rate on the CH oxidation efficiency of landfill cover soils. The simulation results suggested that disregarding O emissions by plants root systems could underestimate the CH oxidation efficiency, especially when the water content ranged from 20% to 35%. Additionally, plants with a parabolic root architecture indicated 7-13% higher CH oxidation efficiency than other root architectures, i.e., uniform, triangular, and exponential. The CH oxidation efficiency increased rapidly at root depths less than 0.25 m. Therefore, plants characterized by a parabolic root architecture, longer root length, and higher ROL capacity should be selected as the preferred species for mitigating CH emissions from landfills in humid areas.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Primary studies have shown that single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the selenoprotein gene () are associated with cancer risk. However, conflicting outcomes warrant a meta-analysis to obtain more precise estimates. Literature search yielded 18 case-control studies from 12 articles. We calculated pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of two  polymorphisms (rs5845 and rs5859) using standard genetic models (homozygous, recessive, dominant and codominant). Subgroup analysis was based on statistical power (80% cutoff) and cancer type (breast/respiratory/genitourinary/colorectal). Heterogeneity of the outcomes necessitated examining their sources (outlier treatment). Multiple comparison outcomes were corrected with the False Discovery Rate (). Our core findings lay in the post-outlier recessive subgroup outcomes, where risks in the powered study (≥ 80%) was increased (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.02-1.57,  = 0.047) while that in genitourinary cancer was protective (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.20-0.43,  < 10).

As there are numerous drastic differences between these two environments (including lower  availability), we hypothesized that this life-history innovation might have produced adaptive pressures on the energy metabolism, which is partially encoded by the mitochondrial genome (OXPHOS). To test this hypothesis, we sequenced mitochondrial genomes of two Ancyrocephalinae species: mesoparasitic  and ectoparasitic . The mitogenomic architecture of  is mostly standard for monogeneans, but that of  exhibits some unique features: missing  gene, very low AT content (60%), a non-canonical start codon of the  gene, and exceptionally long tandem-repeats in the non-coding region (253 bp). Phylogenetic analyses produced paraphyletic Ancyrocephalinae (with embedded Dactylogyrinae), but with low support values. Selective pressure (PAML and HYPHY) and protein structure analyses all found evidence for adaptive evolution in  and  genes of the mesoparasitic . These findings tentatively support our hypothesis of adaptive evolution driven by life-history innovations in the mitogenome of this species. However, as only one stomach-inhabiting mesoparasitic monogenean was available for this analysis, our findings should be corroborated on a larger number of mesoparasitic monogeneans and by physiological studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670297>Predictors of obesity hypoventilation syndrome among patients with sleep-disordered breathing in India.</a></h2><p>No study has been done in India to evaluate obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) among patients with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The known predictors of OHS, i.e., body mass index (BMI) >35 kg/m and forced vital capacity (FVC) <3.5 L for men and <2.3 L for women from western countries, cannot be applied to Indian patients.To find out the prevalence of OHS and to determine the predictors of OHS among Indian SDB patients.It was a retrospective observational study conducted in a tertiary care institute from September 1, 2017, to August 31, 2018. All the patients who underwent polysomnography were analyzed for the presence of OHS. Of 85 patients referred for polysomnography, 76 had SDB. Thirteen patients were excluded because of hypoventilation due to other known causes or could not perform spirometry.The prevalence of OHS among SDB after excluding the other causes of hypoventilation was 15.87% (10/63). The predictors were determined using univariate analysis between daytime partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO) and other predictors. PaCO significantly correlated with minimum nocturnal  saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO), FVC %predicted, BMI, daytime SpO, forced expiratory volume %predicted, and partial pressure of  (PaO). Following a stepwise multiple regression, minimum nocturnal SpO, FVC %predicted, and BMI were found to be independent predictors of OHS. A minimum nocturnal SpO threshold of 60%, FVC %predicted <74.5%, BMI >30.95 kg/m, and absolute FVC <2.33 L for men and <1.68 L for women were found to be predictors of OHS.The prevalence of OHS in Indian patients is similar to Caucasians. OHS is seen in Indian patients even at a lower BMI and lower spirometric parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666806>Process development for pandemic influenza VLP vaccine production using a baculovirus expression system.</a></h2><p>Influenza viruses cause hundreds of thousands of respiratory diseases worldwide each year, and vaccination is considered the most effective approach for preventing influenza annual epidemics or pandemics. Since 1950, chicken embryonated eggs have been used as the main method for producing seasonal influenza vaccines. However, this platform has the main drawback of a lack of scale-up flexibility, and thus, egg-based vaccine manufacturers cannot supply sufficient doses within a short period for use for pandemic prevention. As a result, strategies for reducing the manufacturing time and increasing production capacity are urgently needed. Non-virion vaccine methods have been considered an alternative strategy against an influenza pandemic, and the purpose of maintaining an immunogenic capsule structure with infectious properties appears to be met by the virus-like particle (VLP) platform.An influenza H7N9-TW VLP production platform using insect cells, which included the expression of hemagglutinin (HA), NA, and M1 proteins, was established. To scale up H7N9-TW VLP production, several culture conditions were optimized to obtain a higher production yield. A high level of dissolved  could be critical to H7N9-TW VLP production. If the DO was maintained at a high level, the HA titer obtained in the spinner flask system with ventilation was similar to that obtained in a shake flask. In this study, the HA titer in a 5-L bioreactor with a well-controlled DO level was substantially improved by 128-fold (from 4 HA units (HAU)/50 μL to 512 HAU/50 μL).In this study, a multigene expression platform and an effective upstream process were developed. Notably, a high H7N9-TW VLP yield was achieved using a two-step production strategy while a high DO level was maintained. The upstream process, which resulted in high VLP titers, could be further used for large-scale influenza VLP vaccine production.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672495>Relationships between hypoxia induced factor-1α and F-FDG PET/CT parameters in colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) has a critical role in  homeostasis and it is a transcriptional activator of angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, iron and glucose metabolism. Glucose metabolism rate is increased in some tumours via HIF-1α. Our aim is to evaluate the relationship between hypoxia in colorectal cancer, PET parameters, necrotic tissue size and pathologic prognostic factors via using HIF-1α.70 patients (28 female/42 male; median age: 63 years) who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer via biopsy were staged with preoperative PET/CT and operated subsequently. Immunohistochemical evaluation scoring was done according to nuclear HIF-1α expression, staining density and intensity. Metabolic tumour volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and tumour volume (TV) were calculated by using volume of an ellipsoid formula via CT images, and percentage of tumour necrosis (%TmNcr) that was calculated by the difference between TV and recorded MTV.There was a moderately meaningful positive correlation between tumour SUVmax and TV and %TmNcr (r=0.403, p=0.001 and r=0.500, p=0.0001, respectively). There were no statistically significant relationships between HIF-1α expression levels and tumour SUVmax, TLG, MTV, TV, %TmNcr, tumour stage, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion and extracapsular/capsular lymph node involvement. On the other hand, strong nuclear immunohistochemical staining was seen in tumour cells adjacent to invasive border, inflammatory cells. Although not statistically significant, moderate or strong nuclear staining were seen in 64.9% of metastatic patients.Although the presence of a positive correlation between tumour SUVmax and %TmNcr shows that there are hypoxic cells in cancer tissue with high FDG uptake, the relationship between the presence of HIF-1α and enhanced glucose metabolism and pathological prognostic factors of tumour was not shown. Strong nuclear immunohistochemical staining in tumour cells adjacent to invasive border and inflammatory cells leads us to believe that HIF-1α plays a role in the invasion area of tumour microenvironment.Copyright © 2019.

Female Wistar rats were divided into control, CYP (200 mg/kg), CYP+ITG (1.17 g/kg/day), and CYP+Daidzin (12.5 mg/kg/day) groups. We measured the voiding function by the transcystometrogram and evaluated the pathology with the hematoxylin and eosin and Masson stain. We determined the bladder reactive  species (ROS) amount by an ultrasensitive chemiluminescence analyzer, the expression of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) by Western blot and the expression of multiple cytokine profiles, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 through a cytokine array. ITG extract contains 1.07% of Daidzin through high-performance liquid chromatography. The effect of ITG extract and Daidzin in scavenging hydrogen peroxide activity was more efficient than distilled water. CYP-induced higher urination frequency, shorter intercontraction interval, and lower maximal voiding pressure in the bladders and these symptoms were significantly ameliorated in CYP+ITG and CYP+Daidzin groups. The amount of in vivo bladder ROS and the expression of 3-NT and NOX4 expressions were significantly increased in CYP group but were efficiently decreased in the CYP+ITG and CYP+Daidzin groups. CYP-induced fibrosis, hemorrhage, leukocyte infiltration, and edema in the bladders were significantly attenuated in the CYP+ITG and CYP+Daidzin groups. These results suggested that ITG extract and its active component Daidzin effectively improved CYP-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis through inhibiting the MMP-8, TIMP-1, and oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672481>Low intensity rowing with blood flow restriction over 5 weeks increases V̇Omax in elite rowers: A randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>The present randomized controlled intervention study examined the effects of practical blood flow restriction (pBFR) on maximal  uptake (V̇Omax) during low intensity rowing.Thirty-one elite rowers were either assigned to the intervention (INT) or control (CON) group, using the minimization method (Strata: Gender, Age, Height, V̇Omax).While INT (n=16; 4 female, 12 male, 21.9±3.2 years, 180.4±8.7cm, 73.6±10.9kg, V̇Omax: 63.0±7.9ml/min/kg) used pBFR during boat- and indoor-rowing training, CON (n=15, 4 female, 11 male, 21.7±3.7 years, 180.7±8.1cm, 72.5±12.1kg, V̇Omax: 63.2±8.5ml/min/kg) completed the identical training without pBFR. pBFR of the lower limb was applied via customized elastic wraps. Training took place three times a week over 5 weeks (accumulated net pBFR: 60min/week; occlusion per session: 2-times 10min/session) and was used exclusively at low intensities (<2mmol/L). A spiroergometric ramp test (V̇Omax; 30-40W/min increase) on rowing-ergometer and one-repetition maximum test of the squat exercise (SQ1RM) was employed to assess endurance and strength capacity.Significant group×time interactions (η²=0.26) in favor of INT were found for V̇Omax (+9.1±6.2%, Effect Size=1.3) compared to CON (+2.5±6.1%, ES=0.3). SQ1RM (η²=0.01) was not affected by the pBFR intervention.This study revealed that 15 sessions of pBFR application with a cumulative total pBFR load of 5h over a 5 weeks macrocycle remarkably increased V̇Omax. Thus, pBFR might serve as a promising means to improve aerobic capacity in highly trained elite rowers.Copyright © 2019 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Fruit.</a></h2><p>Spongy tissue disorder, a mesocarp specific malady, severely affects the flavor and pulp characters of Alphonso mango fruit reducing its consumer acceptability. Here, we investigated comparative metabolomic changes that occur during ripening in healthy and spongy tissue-affected fruits using high resolution mass spectrometric analysis. During the spongy tissue formation, 46 metabolites were identified to be differentially accumulated. These putative metabolites belong to various primary and secondary metabolic pathways potentially involved in maintaining the quality of the fruit. Analysis revealed metabolic variations in tricarboxylic acid cycle and gamma amino butyric acid shunt generating reactive  species, which causes stressed conditions inside the mesocarp. Further, reduced levels of antioxidants and enzymes dissipating reactive  species in mesocarp deteriorate the fruit physiology. This oxidative stress all along affects the level of amino acids, sugars and enzymes responsible for flavor generation in the fruit. Our results provide metabolic insights into spongy tissue development in ripening Alphonso mango fruit.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673012>Acute effects of different static stretching exercises orders on cardiovascular and autonomic responses.</a></h2><p>The present study examined the acute effects of static stretching (SS) exercise order on cardiac responses. Seventeen individuals were submitted to two experimental SS session: Order "A" (larger to small muscles groups) and Order "B" (small to larger muscles groups). Heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), rate-pressure product (RPP)  saturation (SpO), and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured at rest, midpoint of the session, immediately after the session, and in 5, 10, and 20 minutes after. SS increased HR and RPP in both orders, while reducing the rMSSD index and SpO. In the order "A", the SBP and DBP increased at the midpoint of the session. In the order "B", the SBP and DBP increased only immediately after the end of the session. DBP and RPP significantly higher in order "A" compared to order "B" in the midpoint of the session. It was also demonstrated higher values of DBP and minor mean R-R intervals in order "B" at 10 min-post session. SS increased cardiac overload in both performed orders. The overload generated by the SS of the larger muscles groups was greater when compared to the smaller muscles groups, suggesting that the exercise order interferes in cardiac overload.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667715>Resveratrol Activates Neuronal Autophagy Through AMPK in the Ischemic Brain.</a></h2><p>During cerebral ischemia,  and glucose levels decrease, producing many consequences such as the generation of reactive  species, tissue injury, and the general metabolism collapse. Resveratrol triggers signaling dependent on the protein kinase activated by adenosine monophosphate (AMPK), the sensor of cellular energy metabolism that regulates autophagy, eliminates damaged mitochondria, and increases energy sources. In the present study, we investigated the participation of AMPK activation in the protective effect of resveratrol on cerebral ischemia and excitotoxicity. We found that resveratrol increased the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the cerebral cortex of rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and in primary cultured neurons exposed to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Resveratrol (1.8 mg/Kg; i. v.; administered at the beginning of reperfusion) decreased the infarct area and increased survival of rats subjected to MCAO. In neuronal cultures, resveratrol treatment (40 μM, after excitotoxicity) reduced the production of superoxide anion, prevented the overload of intracellular Ca associated to mitochondrial failure, reduced the release of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, and reduced death. It also promoted mitophagy (increased Beclin 1 level, favored the recruitment of LC3-II, reduced LAMP1, and reduced mitochondrial matrix protein HSP60 levels). In both models, inhibition of AMPK activation with Compound C obstructed the effect of resveratrol, showing that its protective effect depends, partially, on the activation of the AMPK/autophagy pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673990>Dyspnea in COPD: New Mechanistic Insights and Management Implications.</a></h2><p>Dyspnea is the most common symptom experienced by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To avoid exertional dyspnea, many patients adopt a sedentary lifestyle which predictably leads to extensive skeletal muscle deconditioning, social isolation, and its negative psychological sequalae. This "dyspnea spiral" is well documented and it is no surprise that alleviation of this distressing symptom has become a key objective highlighted across COPD guidelines. In reality, this important goal is often difficult to achieve, and successful symptom management awaits a clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms of dyspnea and how these can be therapeutically manipulated for the patients' benefit. Current theoretical constructs of the origins of activity-related dyspnea generally endorse the classical demand-capacity imbalance theory. Thus, it is believed that disruption of the normally harmonious relationship between inspiratory neural drive (IND) to breathe and the simultaneous dynamic response of the respiratory system fundamentally shapes the expression of respiratory discomfort in COPD. Sadly, the symptom of dyspnea cannot be eliminated in patients with advanced COPD with relatively fixed pathophysiological impairment. However, there is evidence that effective symptom palliation is possible for many. Interventions that reduce IND, without compromising alveolar ventilation (V), or that improve respiratory mechanics and muscle function, or that address the affective dimension, achieve measurable benefits. A common final pathway of dyspnea relief and improved exercise tolerance across the range of therapeutic interventions (bronchodilators, exercise training, ambulatory , inspiratory muscle training, and opiate medications) is reduced neuromechanical dissociation of the respiratory system. These interventions, singly and in combination, partially restore more harmonious matching of excessive IND to ventilatory output achieved. In this review we propose, on the basis of a thorough review of the recent literature, that effective dyspnea amelioration requires combined interventions and a structured multidisciplinary approach, carefully tailored to meet the specific needs of the individual.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666580>Southwest Greenland shelf glaciation during MIS 4 more extensive than during the Last Glacial Maximum.</a></h2><p>Although geological and modelling evidence indicate that the last glacial inception in North America was in NE Canada, little is known about the glacial response of the nearby western Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) during the glacial advance of marine  isotope stage 4 (MIS4). Our multi-proxy study of a marine sediment core collected about 60 km southwest of the Outer Hellefisk Moraines demonstrates that in the southern Davis Strait region the most extreme Greenland shelf glaciation of the last glacial cycle occurred during MIS 4, with another prominent glacial advance at 37-33 kyr BP. During those periods the GIS likely reached the Outer Hellefisk Moraines in this area. Except for these two periods, our data suggest significant advection of relatively warm Irminger Sea Water by the West Greenland Current since MIS 4. This advection likely limited the extent of the MIS2 glaciation on the SW Greenland shelf. Decreased precipitation over southwestern Greenland predicted by atmospheric models as a downstream effect of a much larger MIS2 Laurentide Ice Sheet may have played an additional role.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665937>Salusin-α mitigates diabetic nephropathy via inhibition of the Akt/mTORC1/p70S6K signaling pathway in diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Salusin-α is a bioactive peptide that protects against atherosclerosis and hepatosteatosis. Serum salusin-α level is declined in patients suffering with renal insufficiency. However, it is still undefined whether salusin-α plays a role in diabetic nephropathy. The present study was designed to investigate the potential roles of salusin-α in diabetic renal disease. Herein, we demonstrated that the salusin-α levels in both plasma and kidney tissues from diabetic rats were obviously downregulated. Exogenous administration of salusin-α eliminated the typical characteristics of diabetic nephropathy. Salusin-α treatment decreased renal fibrosis, which was related with reduced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of renal tubular epithelial cells. Injection of salusin-α suppressed the production of reactive  species (ROS) via attenuation of NADPH oxidase subunits protein expressions and recovery of the antioxidant system. Mechanistically, the activated Akt/mTORC1/p70S6K signaling pathway in diabetic nephropathy was counteracted by salusin-α treatment. Our results demonstrated that salusin-α exerted protective effect against diabetic nephropathy via reduced oxidative stress and fibrosis, dependent on inactivation of the Akt/mTORC1/p70S6K signaling cascade. Salusin-α may be considered as a promising target for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669102>Aglaia odorata Lour. extract inhibit ischemic neuronal injury potentially via suppressing p53/Puma-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.</a></h2><p>Aglaia odorata Lour. is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant possessing properties of improving blood circulation, and it is widely used in the treatment of dizziness, traumatic injuries and bruises.In this study, we are aimed to investigate the cerebral protection effect of the extracts from leaves of Aglaia odorata Lour. (ELA) and the potential mechanism in vivo and in vitro.The therapeutic effect of ELA on ischemic cerebral stroke was measured on a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. Protective effect of ELA on -glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced PC12 cells was measured by MTT assay. The apoptotic cells were observed by Hoechst 33258 staining and acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining assay. Mitochondria were observed by Mitotracker staining assay. The mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by JC-1 staining assay. Western blot was used to investigate the effects of ELA on apoptosis-related proteins.We showed that ELA was an effective neuroprotective agent. In vivo experiments, ELA exerted significant protective effect on MCAO model. TTC staining showed that ELA could reduce cerebral infarction area against MCAO insult. HE and Nissl's staining indicated that ELA could reverse the damage of cortex and hippocampus caused by MCAO. In vitro experiments, ELA showed significant protective effect on OGD/R-induced PC12 cells by reducing the number of apoptotic cells, increasing mitochondrial membrane potential, and reducing superoxide aggregation, further suppressing mitochondrial caspase-9/3 apoptosis pathway. Moreover, protective effect of ELA on mitochondrial function may be exerted by inhibiting p53/Puma signal pathway.Our results suggest that ELA exerts a marked neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia potentially via suppressing p53/Puma-mediated mitochondrial caspase-9/3 apoptosis pathway.Copyright © 2019.

In the present study, we sought to investigate whether vitamin E (Vit E) or reduced glutathione (GSH) enhances sperm production by decreasing ROS accumulation during in vitro maturation of prepubertal mice testes. Testes of prepubertal mice were cryopreserved using a freezing medium supplemented or not supplemented with Vit E and were cultured after thawing. In presence of Rol alone in culture medium, frozen-thawed (F-T) testicular tissues exhibited a higher ROS accumulation than fresh tissue during in vitro culture. However, Vit E supplementation in freezing, thawing, and culture media significantly decreased cytoplasmic ROS accumulation in F-T testicular tissue during in vitro maturation when compared with F-T testicular tissue cultured in the presence of Rol alone, whereas GSH supplementation in culture medium significantly increased ROS accumulation associated with cytolysis and tissue disintegration. Vit E but not GSH promoted a better in vitro sperm production and was a suitable ROS scavenger and effective molecule to improve the yield of in vitro spermatogenesis from F-T prepubertal mice testes. The prevention of oxidative stress in the cytoplasmic compartment should be regarded as a potential strategy for improving testicular tissue viability and functionality during the freeze-thaw procedure and in vitro maturation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666019>The long non-coding RNA lncRNA973 is involved in cotton response to salt stress.</a></h2><p>Long non-coding (lnc) RNAs are a class of functional RNA molecules greater than 200 nucleotides in length, and lncRNAs play important roles in various biological regulatory processes and response to the biotic and abiotic stresses. LncRNAs associated with salt stress in cotton have been identified through RNA sequencing, but the function of lncRNAs has not been reported. We previously identified salt stress-related lncRNAs in cotton (Gossypium spp.), and discovered the salt-related lncRNA-lncRNA973.In this study, we identified the expression level, localization, function, and preliminary mechanism of action of lncRNA973. LncRNA973, which was localized in the nucleus, was expressed at a low level under nonstress conditions but can be significantly increased by salt treatments. Here lncRNA973 was transformed into Arabidopsis and overexpressed. Along with the increased expression compared with wild type under salt stress conditions in transgenic plants, the seed germination rate, fresh weights and root lengths of the transgenic plants increased. We also knocked down the expression of lncRNA973 using virus-induced gene silencing technology. The lncRNA973 knockdown plants wilted, and the leaves became yellowed and dropped under salt-stress conditions, indicating that the tolerance to salt stress had decreased compared with wild type. LncRNA973 may be involved in the regulation of reactive  species-scavenging genes, transcription factors and genes involved in salt stress-related processes in response to cotton salt stress.LncRNA973 was localized in the nucleus and its expression was increased by salt treatment. The lncRNA973-overexpression lines had increased salt tolerance compared with the wild type, while the lncRNA973 knockdown plants had reduced salt tolerance. LncRNA973 regulated cotton responses to salt stress by modulating the expression of a series of salt stress-related genes. The data provides a basis for further studies on the mechanisms of lncRNA973-associated responses to salt stress in cotton.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672093>Nitrous oxide inhalation sedation in dentistry: An overview of its applications and safety profile.</a></h2><p>Nitrous oxide in  (NO/O) inhalation sedation is used less commonly by Singapore dentists than their counterparts in the United Kingdom and the United States.

Herein, a Co(ii) ion-driven self-assembly strategy is described for the synthesis of cobalt-based nanostructured transition metal compounds (Co-NTMCs) embedded in nitrogen and sulfur codoped hierarchical porous carbon submicrospheres (Co-NTMCs@NSC), where condensation of thiourea-ethylenediamine-formaldehyde resin (TEFR) is induced by Co(ii) ions which is simultaneously assembled with polydopamine to form a multifunctional precursor through coordinated interaction. The resulting Co-NTMCs@NSC sample comprises abundant hierarchical porous textures, a high content of active cobalt species including the nanoparticles of Co, Co3O4 and amorphous CoSx, and a considerable amount of defective structures. These characteristics lead to remarkable  electrocatalytic activities, with a half-wave potential of +0.833 V vs. RHE, which is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C for the  reduction reaction (ORR), and a lower overpotential of 284 mV than RuO2 at 10 mA·cm-2 for the  evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Furthermore, its operational stability is also much higher than that of commercial RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts. When used as a breathing air electrode for Zn-air batteries, Co-NTMCs@NSC shows a higher open-circuit voltage (1.509 V), higher discharge power density (262 mW cm-2) and better charge-discharge reversibility than commercial Pt/C. The results from the present work suggest that controlled assembly of functional polymers may be exploited for the preparation of doped carbon/metal nanoparticle nanocomposites as viable, high-performance catalysts for electrochemical energy technologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669882>PINK1 depletion sensitizes non-small cell lung cancer to glycolytic inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate: Involvement of ROS and mitophagy.</a></h2><p>Despite significant strides in understanding the pathophysiology of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), these neoplasms typically present with intrinsic chemo- and radiotherapeutic resistance. Transcriptomic analyses of patient NSCLC tumors stratified by survival times have identified the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) as a molecular governor of tumor aggressiveness and patient survival time. PINK1 has been shown to confer neuroprotection in models of Parkinson Disease by ensuring proper mitochondrial turnover (mitophagy), the upkeep of ATP production and sequestering of reactive  species (ROS).We utilized an shRNA against PINK1 and the glycolytic inhibitor 3-BP to assess effects on NSCLC viability via MTS cell viability assay. ATP levels, caspase-9 activation, mitophagy and ROS production were determined with standardly available kits. Cytochrome c cellular localization and phosphorylated parkin levels were determined using an ELISA.Our results demonstrate that PINK1 depletion in the NSCLC cell line A549 via shRNA, reduced cancer cell proliferation, increased cell death, reduced ATP production, inhibited mitophagy and increased ROS and caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. PINK1 depleted cells were more susceptible to the glycolytic inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP), which further perturbed ATP production. PINK1 depletion and 3-BP synergistically increased ROS production, caspase-9-dependent apoptosis and additively repressed mitophagy.These results suggest that PINK1 depletion alters energetic metabolism and confers sensitivity to agents that inhibit glycolysis. Targeting accelerated tumor cell metabolism may prove useful in the clinical setting while sparing non-malignant tissue.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

We used the lung cancer cell line, A549, to determine the effects of the curcuminoids and cisplatin on cell viability and several apoptotic signaling mechanisms. Cellular viability was measured using the MTT assay. A scratch assay was used to measure cell migration and fluorescent spectrophotometry to measure reactive  species (ROS) production. Western blots and luminescence assays were used to measure the expression and activity of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), caspases-3/7, -8, -9, and -12, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (Src). A zebrafish model was used to evaluate auditory effects. Cisplatin, the curcuminoids, and their combinations had similar effects on cell viability (IC values: 2-16 μM) and AIF, caspase-12, JNK, MAPK, and Src expression, while caspase-3/7, -8, and -9 activity was unchanged or decreased. Cisplatin increased ROS yield (1.2-fold), and curcuminoid and combination treatments reduced ROS (0.75-0.85-fold). Combination treatments reduced A549 migration (0.51-0.53-fold). Both curcuminoids reduced auditory threshold shifts induced by cisplatin. In summary, cisplatin and the curcuminoids might cause cell death through AIF and caspase-12. The curcuminoids may potentiate cisplatin's effect against A549 migration, but may counteract cisplatin's effect to increase ROS production. The curcuminoids might also prevent cisplatin ototoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669896>MicroRNAs involved in innate immunity regulation in the sea cucumber: A review.</a></h2><p>The sea cucumber is one of the most economically significant echinoderms. The immunity against exogenous stimulation of sea cucumber is of great academic and economic importance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short endogenous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are considered as vital regulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses in most eukaryotes. In sea cucumbers, some miRNAs (such as miR-133, miR-137, and miR-2008, among others) that participate in the regulation of innate immunity have been recently identified and characterized. This review focuses on those known miRNAs and their corresponding target genes that participate in the regulation of the complement system, Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway, reactive  species (ROS) production and apoptosis pathways in sea cucumbers. Moreover, we cover immune-related miRNA investigations in sea cucumbers that provide insights into developing more miRNA-based biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for sea cucumber diseases.Copyright © 2019.

In pepper (Capsicum annuum), CaWRKY27 positively regulates resistance to the pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and negatively regulates thermotolerance. Here, we report that CaWRKY27 functions in the response to salinity and osmotic stress. CaWRKY27 transcription was induced by salinity, osmotic, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments, as determined using qPCR and GUS assays. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants heterologously expressing CaWRKY27 had an increased sensitivity to salinity and osmotic stress, with a higher inhibition of both root elongation and whole plant growth, more severe chlorosis and wilting, lower germination rates, and an enhanced germination sensitivity to ABA than the corresponding wild-type plants. Furthermore, most marker genes associated with reactive  species (ROS) detoxification and polyamine and ABA biosynthesis, as well as stress-responsive genes NtDREB3, were downregulated in plants transgenically expressing CaWRKY27 upon exposure to salinity or osmotic stress. Consistently, silencing of CaWRKY27 using virus-induced gene silencing conferred tolerance to salinity and osmotic stress in pepper plants. These findings suggest that CaWRKY27 acts as a molecular link in the antagonistic crosstalk regulating the expression of defense-related genes in the responses to both abiotic and biotic stresses by acting either as a transcriptional activator or repressor in pepper.Copyright © 2019.

However, vitamin C is not only an antioxidant, since it is also a cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in plant and human metabolism. In humans, vitamin C takes part in various physiological processes, such as iron absorption, collagen synthesis, immune stimulation, and epigenetic regulation. Due to the functional loss of the gene coding for l-gulonolactone oxidase, humans cannot synthesize vitamin C; thus, they principally utilize plant-based foods for their needs. For this reason, increasing the vitamin C content of crops could have helpful effects on human health. To achieve this objective, exhaustive knowledge of the metabolism and functions of vitamin C in plants is needed. In this review, the multiple roles of vitamin C in plant physiology as well as the regulation of its content, through biosynthetic or recycling pathways, are analyzed. Finally, attention is paid to the strategies that have been used to increase the content of vitamin C in crops, emphasizing not only the improvement of nutritional value of the crops but also the acquisition of plant stress resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668626>Injury Activates a Dynamic Cytoprotective Network to Confer Stress Resilience and Drive Repair.</a></h2><p>In healthy individuals, injured tissues rapidly repair themselves following damage. Within a healing skin wound, recruited inflammatory cells release a multitude of bacteriocidal factors, including reactive  species (ROS), to eliminate invading pathogens. Paradoxically, while these highly reactive ROS confer resistance to infection, they are also toxic to host tissues and may ultimately delay repair. Repairing tissues have therefore evolved powerful cytoprotective "resilience" machinery to protect against and tolerate this collateral damage. Here, we use in vivo time-lapse imaging and genetic manipulation in Drosophila to dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive tissue resilience to wound-induced stress. We identify a dynamic, cross-regulatory network of stress-activated cytoprotective pathways, linking calcium, JNK, Nrf2, and Gadd45, that act to both "shield" tissues from oxidative damage and promote efficient damage repair. Ectopic activation of these pathways confers stress protection to naive tissue, while their inhibition leads to marked delays in wound closure. Strikingly, the induction of cytoprotection is tightly linked to the pathways that initiate the inflammatory response, suggesting evolution of a fail-safe mechanism for tissue protection each time inflammation is triggered. A better understanding of these resilience mechanisms-their identities and precise spatiotemporal regulation-is of major clinical importance for development of therapeutic interventions for all pathologies linked to oxidative stress, including debilitating chronic non-healing wounds.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Studies have confirmed that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a key regulatory role in various inflammatory diseases. However, the miRNA-mediated mechanism of endometrial inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) remains unclear. In this study, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence and Rac family small GTPase 1 (Rac1) interference were used to reveal the overexpression of miR-488 in the LPS-induced bovine uterus, and the effect of protein kinase B κ-light chain enhancement of the nuclear factor-activated B cells (AKT/NF-κB) pathway in intimal epithelial cells. The results showed that the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group when miR-488 was overexpressed. Similar results were observed in the expression levels of p-AKT, p-IKK, and p-p65 proteins. In addition, the dual-luciferase reporter system confirmed that miRNA-488 may directly target the 3'-untranslated region of Rac1. In turn, the expression of Rac1 was inhibited. Moreover, the nuclear translocation of NF-κB was inhibited, and meanwhile, the accumulation of reactive  species (ROS) in the cells was reduced. Thus, we provide basic data for the negative regulation of miR-488 in LPS-induced inflammation by inhibiting ROS production and the AKT/NF-kB pathway in intimal epithelial cells.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671955>Broadband sound propagation in a seagrass meadow throughout a diurnal cycle.</a></h2><p>Acoustic propagation measurements were conducted in a Thalassia testudinum meadow in the Lower Laguna Madre, a shallow bay on the Texas Gulf of Mexico coast.

Previous studies have shown that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) triggers endothelial dysfunction in vitro by initiating oxidative stress and/or an inflammatory response. In addition, cerebral endothelial dysfunction (particularly at the level of the blood-brain barrier [BBB]) contributes to stroke pathogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that cigarette smoking may influence stroke, at least in part, by exacerbating ischaemia-induced BBB disruption. To test this, we examined the effect of CSE on the permeability of cerebral endothelial cells exposed to  glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD + RO). We found that the loss of BBB integrity following ischaemic/reperfusion-like conditions was significantly worsened by CSE. Despite this being associated with increased mRNA expression of Nox catalytic subunits, reactive  species (ROS) levels were however markedly lower. Furthermore, this occurred in association with elevated expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD1, SOD2, and Gpx-1), suggesting an antioxidant defence response. Lastly, we found that CSE significantly upregulated mRNA expression of cytokines (IL-6 and TGF-β). Collectively, these results show that acute exposure to CSE worsens BBB disruption caused by OGD + RO, however, this is not linked to elevated ROS levels but may involve inflammatory mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668052>Association between Abdominal Obesity and Oxidative Stress in Korean Adults.</a></h2><p>Obesity causes several changes in the body and is associated with both inflammation and oxidative stress. However, the relationship between abdominal obesity, diacron-reactive  metabolites (d-ROMs), and biological antioxidant potential (BAP) levels in Korean adults has not yet been proved. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between d-ROMs, BAP levels, and abdominal obesity in the Korean adult population using clinical data.A total of 2,367 individuals, aged 18-86 years, were identified from health check-up examination records at a university hospital, between January 2015 and August 2016. Clinical and biochemical parameters, including waist circumference, lipid profile, alcohol drinking status, and smoking status, were investigated. Oxidative stress levels, viz., d-ROM concentration and antioxidant capacity, viz., BAP, were measured.Subjects with abdominal obesity presented significantly higher levels of d-ROMs compared to those with a normal waist circumference (P<0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, alcohol drinking status; smoking status; and triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein levels were found to have a significant positive correlation with abdominal obesity (P<0.001). BAP did not significantly correlate with abdominal obesity.We observed a positive association between abdominal obesity and d-ROM concentration. This result indicates that abdominal obesity can increase oxidative stress and may affect the pathways involved in obesity, such as the inflammatory pathway. Such correlation analyses were helpful in revealing the causes, as well as methods to reduce, oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673314>Prodrug strategies for targeted therapy triggered by reactive  species.</a></h2><p>Increased levels of reactive  species (ROS) have been associated with numerous pathophysiological conditions including cancer and inflammation and the ROS stimulus constitutes a potential trigger for drug delivery strategies.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of renal tubular epithelial cells is one of the main processes involving renal fibrosis and its inhibition is considered as a preventive/therapeutic strategy for CKD. Trigonelline (TRIG), a plant alkaloid commonly found in herbs, coffee bean, soy bean and other edible food plants, has several beneficial effects on human health and has been proposed to reduce renal fibrosis but with unclear mechanisms. This study thus addressed cellular mechanism underlying the anti-fibrogenic effects of TRIG in renal tubular epithelial cells grown in vitro. EMT was successfully induced by oxalate treatment as indicated by morphological changes into spindle-shape cells, increased expression of mesenchymal proteins (fibronectin, vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)), decreased expression of epithelial proteins (E-cadherin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1)) and increased activity of a profibrotic factor (matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)). Interestingly, these oxalate-induced EMT features could be attenuated by TRIG pretreatment. Moreover, TRIG also prevented oxalate-induced cell migration, reactive  species (ROS) overproduction, and down-regulation of Nrf-2 signaling molecule. These data indicated that TRIG could attenuate the effects of oxalate-induced EMT and thus may serve as the anti-fibrotic compound for prevention and/or treatment of CKD.Copyright © 2019.

It is a unique example of an immune deficiency that is linked to dysfunctional mitochondrial energy metabolism and caused by adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) deficiency. It is characterized by an early differentiation arrest in the myeloid lineage, impaired lymphoid maturation, and sensorineural hearing loss. In this study, a novel AK2 homozygous mutation, c.622 T > C [p.Ser208Pro], was identified in an Old Order Amish patient through whole exome sequencing. Functional studies showed that the patient's cells have no detectable AK2 protein, as well as low  consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and proton production rate (PPR). An increased production of reactive  species, mitochondrial membrane permeability, and mitochondrial mass, and decreased ATP production, were also observed. The results confirm the pathogenicity of the AK2 mutation and demonstrate that reticular dysgenesis should be considered in Amish individuals presenting with immune deficiency.

Advanced liver fibrosis can evolve in cirrhosis, portal hypertension and often requires liver transplantation. At the cellular level, hepatic fibrosis involves the activation of hepatic stellate cells and their transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts. Numerous pro-fibrogenic mediators including the transforming growth factor-β1, the platelet-derived growth factor, endothelin-1, toll-like receptor 4, and reactive  species are key players in this process. Knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic fibrosis development need to be extended to find novel therapeutic strategies. Antifibrotic therapies aim to inhibit the accumulation of fibrogenic cells and/or prevent the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. Natural products from terrestrial and marine sources, including sulfur-containing compounds, exhibit promising activities for the treatment of fibrotic pathology. Although many therapeutic interventions are effective in experimental models of liver fibrosis, their efficacy and safety in humans are largely unknown. This review aims to provide a reference collection on experimentally tested natural anti-fibrotic compounds, with particular attention on sulfur-containing molecules. Their chemical structure, sources, mode of action, molecular targets, and pharmacological activity in the treatment of liver disease will be discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669774>Behavior of ionophore antibiotics in aquatic environments in Argentina: The distribution on different scales in water courses and the role of wetlands in depuration.</a></h2><p>We studied for the first time three ionophore anticoccidial drugs: monensin (MON), lasalocid (LAS), and salinomycin (SAL) as emerging pollutants originating from animal and plant husbandry in surface waters (n = 89) in one of the most extensive hydrological basins in South América (Del Plata basin). The soluble fraction of ionophores was pretreated by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by LC-MS/MS at a limit of detection of 1.7 ng·L. A statistical approach noted the need to report parameters calculated by methods based on the number of observations and the censorship percentage over substitution methods for more precise estimations of environmental data with a high percentage of left-censored data. Water collectors adjacent to intensive-husbandry facilities, placed in direct runoffs from animal excreta, or in wastewater emissions contained median concentrations of MON and SAL approximately 70 times higher than those found in regional tributaries and main courses of 5 sub-basins of the pampas and mesopotamic regions, thus exhibiting a relevance to other similar agricultural pollutants widely reported as pesticides. Chemical speciation of these compounds in surface water was characterized especially for MON and SAL, where the pH and chemical  demand of the natural water body was associated with the concentration of the soluble fraction. The concentrations in abundant rivers such as the Gualeguay deliver a contribution to a natural wetland such as the Paraná-River delta, which registered only one sample with a [MON] ≤ the limit of quantification. Since wetlands possess a limited removal capability, these affluent contributions recorded strongly indicate that attention must be paid to the development of guidelines involving quality criteria for assessing the impact of ionophore antibiotics on such ecosystems.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This response has been described for more than 80 animal species belonging to eight phyla during hypometabolism or situations that limit  availability. The pattern of the typical POS-response, in which a mild redox imbalance triggers antioxidant adjustments that results in increased tolerance to subsequent oxidative insults, roughly follows the curve of hormetic phenomena. A similar pattern has been reported for various animal species exposed to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) - these studies, on animals from six phyla, are discussed herein. In the light of the similarities in the redox-response of animals exposed to either  restriction or UVR, we argue in this essay that UVR elicits a type of response that fits the POS theory. Exposure to UVR induces both reactive species formation and antioxidant adaptation, which is the essence of typical POS-responses. Thus, antioxidant response to UVR in animals can be categorized as a POS-type mechanism. Moreover, considering that animals are exposed to multiple stressors simultaneously in nature, this would represent an ecologically relevant process, by which one stressor (e.g., UV or ionizing radiation) may enhance the tolerance to other. We also discuss a possible role of low doses of ionizing radiation as inductor of POS-like responses in animals.Copyright © 2019.

Adipose tissue is a vital metabolic organ in energy balance and glucose homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the role of VDR expressed on adipose tissue in the balance of energy metabolism. This study was conducted in VDR-KO mice, VDR-Tg mice and wild-type mice. Energy metabolism was determined based on the energy expenditure,  consumption, respiratory exchange rate, food and water intake, and a cool room test. VDR expression in the tissues of VDR-Tg mice was assessed by western blotting. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, leptin, and glucose were assessed using the respective kits. Insulin resistance in the whole body was evaluated by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test. mRNA associated with energy metabolism expression in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue was examined by RT-PCR. Our results show that overexpression of VDR in adipose tissue induced an increase in body weight, fat mass, and serum lipid levels, and a decline in energy metabolism; these changes were ameliorated by VDR-KO mice. Overexpression of VDR in the adipose tissue of VDR-Tg mice induced a state of insulin resistance, which corresponded with decreased expression of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, CPT2 and HK in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue; these changes were also reversed by VDR-KO mice. Our study confirms that expression levels of VDR in adipose tissue play pivotal roles in energy balance and glycolipid metabolism by regulating adipose tissue remodeling.Copyright © 2019.

Absorption, stability, catalytic behavior of immobilized enzymes and reusability of resultant fibrous bio-catalysts were comparatively studied. Full characterization of PN before and after respective modifications was carried out by various analytical, instrumental and arithmetic techniques. Results showed that modified polyester having amine terminal functional groups pledged better surface property providing up to 31% enzyme loading, and 81% active immobilized enzymes. The activity of the enzyme was measured in terms of interaction aptitude of GOx in a given time to produce hydrogen peroxide using colorimetric assay. The immobilized GOx retained 50% of its original activity after being reused six (06) times and exhibited improved stability compared with the free enzyme in relation to temperature. The reaction kinetics, loading efficiency, leaching, and reusability analysis of enzyme allowed drawing a parallel to the type of organic moiety integrated during GOx immobilization.

In liver, genetic or acquired impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can reduce ATP output but also decrease fatty acid oxidation, thus leading to different hepatic lesions including massive necrosis and microvesicular steatosis. Hence, a severe impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can lead to liver failure and death. An increasing number of investigations report that some drugs can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) by altering mtDNA homeostasis. Some drugs such as ciprofloxacin, antiretroviral nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and tacrine can inhibit hepatic mtDNA replication, thus inducing mtDNA depletion. Drug-induced reduced mtDNA levels can also be the consequence of reactive  species-mediated oxidative damage to mtDNA, which triggers its degradation by mitochondrial nucleases. Such mechanism is suspected for acetaminophen and troglitazone. Other pharmaceuticals such as linezolid and tetracyclines can impair mtDNA translation, thus selectively reducing the synthesis of the 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins. Lastly, some drugs might alter the mtDNA methylation status but the pathophysiological consequences of such alteration are still unclear. Drug-induced impairment of mtDNA homeostasis is probably under-recognized since preclinical and post-marketing safety studies do not classically investigate mtDNA levels, mitochondrial protein synthesis and mtDNA oxidative damage.Copyright © 2019.

The nanoscopic electrochemistry anatomized in this work sets an ambient limit to material properties, which is universal to not only 2D but also other forms of materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667174>Combination of propofol and dezocine to improve safety and efficacy of anesthesia for gastroscopy and colonoscopy in adults: A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Gastroscopy and colonoscopy are important and common endoscopic methods for the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal and colorectal diseases. However, endoscopy is usually associated with adverse reactions such as nervousness, nausea, vomiting, choking cough, and pain. Severe discomfort, such as vomiting, coughing, or body movement, may lead to aggravation of a pre-existing condition or even interruption of examination or treatment, especially in some critically ill patients with physiological dysfunction (., cardiovascular or respiratory disease). The optimal methods for inducing analgesia and sedation in endoscopy are areas of ongoing debate; nevertheless, determining an appropriate regimen of sedation and analgesia is important.To evaluate the effects of propofol combined with dezocine, sufentanil, or fentanyl in painless gastroscopy and colonoscopy.Four hundred patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups for anesthesia: intravenous dezocine, sufentanil, fentanyl, or saline. Propofol was administered intravenously for induction and maintenance of anesthesia.The dosage of propofol in the dezocine group was significantly lower than those in other groups ( < 0.01). Bispectral index and Steward score (0-6 points, an unresponsive, immobile patient whose airway requires maintenance to a fully recovered patient) after eye opening in the dezocine group were significantly higher than those in other groups ( < 0.01). Awakening time and postoperative pain score (0-10 points, no pain to unbearable pain) in the dezocine group were significantly lower than those in other groups ( < 0.01). Mean arterial pressure and pulse  saturation in the dezocine group were significantly more stable at various time points (before dosing, disappearance of eyelash reflex, and wakeup) than those in other groups ( < 0.01). The rates of hypopnea, jaw thrust, body movements, and usage of vasoactive drugs in the dezocine group were significantly lower than those in other groups ( < 0.01). Additionally, the rates of reflex coughing, nausea, and vomiting were not statistically different between the four groups ( > 0.05).The combination of propofol and dezocine can decrease propofol dosage, reduce the risk for the development of inhibitory effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, increase analgesic effect, decrease body movement, shorten awakening time, and improve awakening quality.©The Author(s) 2019.

NaGd(MoO4)2-based materials have a scheelite structure with good thermal and chemical stability, and excellent up-conversion luminescence properties after co-doping rare earth ions (Tm3+ and Yb3+), which can effectively excite the photosensitizer to generate reactive  species (ROS). In this work, Tm3+ and Yb3+ co-doped NaGd(MoO4)2 upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are prepared by the sol-gel method and further complexed with photosensitizer MC540 (UCNPs@MC540). The prepared UCNPs showed a tetragonal phase and revealed nanoparticles with an average size of 150 nm. Under 980 nm excitation, the UCNPs exhibited a dominant blue emission band (1G4 → 3H6) of Tm3+, while the optimum doping concentration was identified at 1% Tm3+ and 20% Yb3+. In addition, the blue emissions of Tm3+ simultaneously activate the MC540 composited on the surface of the nanoparticles to produce a large amount of singlet  (1O2), which is detected by DCFH-DA. Moreover, UCNPs@MC540 also shows strong emission at around 800 nm near-infrared. The results show that the UCNPs@MC540 materials have potential application prospects in PDT and biological imaging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672586>New Approach to Measuring  Diffusion and Consumption in Encapsulated Living Cells, based on Electron Spin Resonance Microscopy.</a></h2><p>Cell microencapsulation within biocompatible polymers is an established technology for immobilizing living cells that secrete therapeutic products.  These can be transplanted into a desired site in the body for the controlled and continuous delivery of the therapeutic molecules.  One of the most important properties of the material that makes up the microcapsule is its  penetrability, which is critical for the cells' survival.   reaches the cells inside the microcapsules via a diffusion process.  The diffusion coefficient for the microcapsules' gel material is commonly measured using bulk techniques, where the gel in a chamber is first flushed with nitrogen and the subsequent rate of  diffusion back into it is measured by an  electrode placed in the chamber.  This technique does not address possible heterogeneities between microcapsules, and also cannot reveal O heterogeneity inside the microcapsule resulting from the living cells' activity.  Here we develop and demonstrate a proof of principle for a new approach to measuring and imaging the partial pressure of  (pO) inside a single microcapsule by means of high-resolution and high-sensitivity electron spin resonance (ESR).  The proposed methodology makes use of biocompatible paramagnetic microparticulates intercalated inside the microcapsule during its preparation.  The new ESR approach was used to measure the O diffusion properties of two types of gel materials (alginate and extracellular matrix - ECM), as well as to map a 3D image of the  inside single microcapsules with living cells.Copyright © 2019.

The poor prognosis may be largely attributed to inadequate disease response to current chemotherapeutic agents. Activation of p38 is associated with deleterious outcomes in glioblastoma patients, as its signaling mediates chemoresistance mechanisms. Antimicrobial peptide tilapia piscidin (TP) 4 was identified from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and exhibits strong bactericidal effects on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. TP4 also has anticancer activity toward human triple-negative breast cancer cells and glioblastoma cells. In the present study, we tested the cytotoxic effects of combined TP4 and p38 inhibitors on glioblastoma U251 cells. We found that the combination of TP4 and p38 inhibitors (SB202190 and VX-745) enhanced cytotoxicity in U251 glioblastoma cells but not noncancerous neural cells. Cytotoxicity from the combination treatments proceeded via necrosis and not apoptosis. Mechanistically, SB202190 potentiated TP4-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive  species generation and unbalanced antioxidant status, which resulted in necrotic cell death. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that combinations of TP4 and p38 inhibitors have the potential to preferentially target glioblastoma cells, while sparing noncancerous neural cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666108>GSTZ1 deficiency promotes hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation via activation of the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway.</a></h2><p>Glutathione S-transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1) is the penultimate enzyme in phenylalanine/tyrosine catabolism. GSTZ1 is dysregulated in cancers; however, its role in tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is largely unknown. We aimed to assess the role of GSTZ1 in HCC and to reveal the underlying mechanisms, which may contribute to finding a potential therapeutic strategy against HCC.We first analyzed GSTZ1 expression levels in paired human HCC and adjacent normal tissue specimens and the prognostic effect of GSTZ1 on HCC patients. Thereafter, we evaluated the role of GSTZ1 in aerobic glycolysis in HCC cells on the basis of the  consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Furthermore, we assessed the effect of GSTZ1 on HCC proliferation, glutathione (GSH) concentration, levels of reactive  species (ROS), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling via gain- and loss- of GSTZ1 function in vitro. Moreover, we investigated the effect of GSTZ1 on diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl) induced hepatocarcinogenesis in a mouse model of HCC.GSTZ1 was downregulated in HCC, thus indicating a poor prognosis. GSTZ1 deficiency significantly promoted hepatoma cell proliferation and aerobic glycolysis in HCC cells. Moreover, loss of GSTZ1 function depleted GSH, increased ROS levels, and enhanced lipid peroxidation, thus activating the NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathway. Furthermore, Gstz1 knockout in mice promoted DEN/CCl-induced hepatocarcinogenesis via activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the antioxidant agent N-acetylcysteine and NRF2 inhibitor brusatol effectively suppressed the growth of Gstz1-knockout HepG2 cells and HCC progression in Gstz1 mice.GSTZ1 serves as a tumor suppressor in HCC. GSH depletion caused by GSTZ1 deficiency elevates oxidative stress, thus constitutively activating the NRF2 antioxidant response pathway and accelerating HCC progression. Targeting the NRF2 signaling pathway may be a promising therapeutic approach for this subset of HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673289>Protein hydrolysis and fermentation under methanogenic and acidifying conditions.</a></h2><p>Many kinds of wastewaters contain appreciable quantities of protein. Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of energy as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH 5.The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately 5 times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino acids. Nineteen different amino acids were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical  demand (COD) of these 19 amino acids was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH 5 was 2-25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH 5) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty acids (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino acid fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669212>A cerium oxide loaded glycol chitosan nano-system for the treatment of dry eye disease.</a></h2><p>Dry eye (DE) disease is an uprising health epidemic that directly affects the surface of the eye. We developed a water soluble cerium oxide loaded glycol chitosan nanoparticle as a new type of eye drop, namely GCCNP (glycol chitosan cerium oxide nanoparticles). GCCNP is capable of scavenging cellular reactive  species (ROS) for the treatment of DE disease. The antioxidative effects of GCCNP were assessed in mice primary corneal and conjunctival cells in vitro and in a DE murine model in vivo. GCCNP's effect on the DE models was assessed via histological evaluations, migration assays, cell viability assays, cellular uptake analyses, intracellular ROS scavenging assays, wound healing assays, mitochondrial membrane potential readings, corneal fluorescein staining, tear volume concentrations, tear film break up time analyses, and lastly, analytical/spectroscopic analyses of GCCNP eye drop formulations. Spectroscopic analysis showed that cerium oxide was entrapped into the glycol chitosan (GC). The solubility of cerium in GC (GCCNP) increased to 709.854 ± 24.3 μg/ml compared to its original solubility in cerium oxide, which was measured as 0.020 ± 0.002 μg/ml. GCCNP had no cytotoxic effect and showed improvements on dry eye disease models by stabilizing the tear film, scavenging ROS, up-regulating SOD, promoting and maintaining corneal and conjunctival cell growth and integrity. We provided convincing evidence that GCCNP is an effective treatment for DE and may represent a potential new class of drug for DE disease.Copyright © 2019.

The WO/BiOBr heterojunction exhibits superior photocatalytic activity and photostability compared with pure BiOBr and WO due to an increased  vacancy concentration, an effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and an efficient interfacial charge transfer. Additionally, the WO/BiOBr also shows 2.3 and 41.1 times higher activity than that of TiO P25 and BiVO Alfa Aesar, respectively. Determination of energy band line-up indicates that the WO/BiOBr is a type II-heterojunction where electron-hole pairs are efficiently separated. Mechanistic studies based on radical quenching experiment, EPR trapping study and Hammett plot reveal that the main reaction pathway is the electron transfer route mediated by superoxide radical. A possible surface reaction mechanism, the insightful information on the structure-activity relationship and the involvement of reactive  species elucidated in this work lay an important background for the material design and encourage a further development of highly efficient photocatalysts toward organic fine chemical syntheses.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

An understanding of the tools used by plants to overcome Cd stress could lead to the production of food crops with lower Cd uptake capacity and of plants with greater Cd uptake potential for phytoremediation purposes in order to restore soil efficiency in self-sustaining ecosystems. The signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO), whose function remains unclear, has recently been involved in responses to Cd stress. Using different mutants, such as nia1nia2, nox1, argh1-1 and Atnoa1, which were altered in NO metabolism, we analysed various parameters related to reactive  and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) metabolism and seedling fitness following germination and growth under Cd treatment conditions for seven days. Seedling roots were the most affected, with an increase in ROS and RNS observed in wild type (WT) seedling roots, leading to increased oxidative damage and fitness loss. Mutants that showed lower NO levels in seedling roots under Cd stress were more resistant than WT seedlings due to the maintenance of antioxidant systems which protect against oxidative damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies, conducted mostly with terrestrial plant communities, found controversial evidence for this prediction. We provide here the first test for SDH for epiphytic diatoms. We studied community assembly in diatom communities of astatic ponds. These water bodies serve as a good model system for testing SDH because they exhibit stress gradients of various environmental factors. Functional diversity of diatom communities was assessed based on four traits: (1) combined trait reflecting the trade-off between stress tolerance and competitive dominance, (2) cell size, (3)  requirement and (4) N-uptake strategy. According to our results, salinity, pH and the width of the macrophyte belt appeared as significant predictors of the trait convergence/divergence patterns presumably acting through influencing the availability of carbon dioxide and turbidity. Lower trait diversity was found in turbid, more saline and more alkaline ponds and functional diversity was higher in transparent, less saline and less alkaline ponds. Overall, our results supported the stress dominance hypothesis. In habitats representing increased environmental stress, environmental filtering was the most important community assembly rule, while limiting similarity became dominant under more favourable conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670838>Spatio-temporal variations in salicylic acid and hydrogen peroxide in sunflower seeds during transition from dormancy to germination.</a></h2><p>Phytohormones and reactive  species (ROS) mediate processes such as germination and dormancy. The elucidation of the physiological and biochemical events implicated in the transition from dormancy to germination in different plant species such as sunflower becomes a topic of interest. In this study we investigated the spatio-temporal variation of salicylic acid (SA), hydrogen peroxide (H O ) and the activity of two antioxidant enzymes (catalase, CAT-EC 1.11.1.6-, and ascorbate peroxidase, APX-EC1.11.1.11-) in embryonic axis and cotyledons of dry and imbibed seeds of dormant (B123) and nondormant (B91) sunflower lines. The results showed that embryonic axis had higher level of SA and H O than cotyledons in both lines. In dry seeds, B123 embryo (embryonic axis + cotyledons) showed a higher SA content than B91. After dry storage at room temperature, SA decreased in B123 embryos to a value close to that registered in B91embryos. B123 embryonic axis of dry seeds presented higher H O levels than B91. Dry storage led to an increase of H O levels and a decrease of CAT activity in B123 embryonic axis. During imbibition, B123 seeds stored for 33 days displayed an increase in SA level in the embryonic axis (3 h of imbibition) and this lower level correlated with a decrease in H O (6 h of imbibition). Thus, the embryo-imposed dormancy in B123 dry seeds was associated with high levels of SA and low H O , whereas the dormancy release was linked with SA decrease and increase of H O as a consequence of lower CAT activity.

Complexes 3 and 4 showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 15.3 and 14.7 μg/mL, respectively]. Complex 3 also caused significant growth inhibition of Candida glabrata (MIC = 7.0 μg/mL). Concentrations of complexes 1-4 up to 125 μg/mL had no growth inhibition activity against Escherichia coli. The cytotoxic activity of complexes 1-4 was evaluated against the ovarian cancer cells A2780 and A2780cisR, sensitive and resistant to cisplatin, respectively. All compounds showed high cytotoxic activities against both tumoral cell lines, exhibiting IC values in the low micromolar range (0.9-5.5 μM) upon 48 h incubation. In contrast to complex 1, the complexes 2-4 induced a dose-dependent formation of reactive  species (ROS), similar to the observed for the reference drugs auranofin and cisplatin. Opposite to 4, complexes 1-3 were able to activate caspase 3/7, suggesting the involvement of apoptosis in the mechanism of cell death. Contrasting with cisplatin, complexes 3, 4 and auranofin did not cause DNA damage. Combined, these data provide evidence that these monoanionic gold bisdithiolates, particularly complex 3, are potential lead compounds to further explore as therapeutic drugs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the influence of abnormal  exposures on the plasma metabolomic profiles of rat models with  induced retinopathy was investigated by the gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Rat pups were divided into four groups, each with 12 individuals: (i) reared in room air and sampled at P12 (CT1); (ii) exposed to high  for 5 days and sampled at P12 (HO1, simulating the vaso-obeliteration process (phase I)); (iii) reared in room air and sampled at P17 (CT2); (iv) exposed to high  for 5 days then followed by room air for 5 days and sampled at P17 (HO2, simulating the neovasculization one (phase II)). Plasma samples were analyzed with GC-MS, resulted in 122 metabolite species. Distinct differences in the plasma metabolome were found between groups of CT1 vs. HO1, and HO1 vs. HO2, by using univariate and multivariate analyses. Alternating hyperoxia/hypoxia conditions induced significant changes of richness of proline, ornithine and glutamine that were important components of 'arginine and proline metabolism' pathway. These metabolites contributed largely to plasma sample classification, determined with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and were involved profoundly in the proline-dependent production of reactive  species related to the cellular redox reactions.

Microorganisms play key roles in the dissipation of DMT from the environment; however, the enzymes responsible for the initial transformation of DMT and the possible altered toxicity due to this biotransformation have not been extensively studied. To reduce DMT toxicity, we identified the esterase gene dmtH involved in the initial transformation of DMT from the AOPP herbicide-transforming strain Sphingobium sp. C3. DmtH shows 24-41% identity with α/β-hydrolases and belongs to subfamily V of bacterial esterases. The purified recombinant DmtH was capable of transforming DMT to mono-methyl terephthalate (MMT) and potentially transforming other p-phthalic acid esters, including diallyl terephthalate (DAT) and diethyl terephthalate (DET). Using C. elegans as an assay model, we observed the severe toxicity of DMT in inducing reactive  species (ROS) production, decreasing locomotion behavior, reducing lifespan, altering molecular basis for oxidative stress, and inducing mitochondrial stress. In contrast, exposure to MMT did not cause obvious toxicity, induce oxidative stress, and activate mitochondrial stress in nematodes. Our study highlights the usefulness of Sphingobium sp. C3 and its esterase DmtH in transforming p-phthalic acid esters and reducing the toxicity of DMT to organisms.Copyright © 2019.

Herein, we found that the reaction of precursors containing both nitrogen and  atoms with Ni(II) under 500°C can generate a N/O mixing coordinated Ni-N3O SAC, in which the  atom can be gradually removed under high temperature due to weaker Ni-O interaction, resulting in a vacancy-defect Ni-N3-V SAC at Ni site under 800°C. While the reaction of Ni(II) with the precursor simply containing nitrogen atoms can only obtain a none-vacancy-defect Ni-N4 SAC. Both the results of experimental and DFT calculations reveal that the presence of a vacancy-defect in Ni-N3-V SAC can dramatically boost the electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction, with extremely high CO2 reduction current density of 65 mA/cm2 and high Faradaic efficiency over 90% at -0.9 V vs RHE, as well as a record high turnover frequency of 1.35×105 h-1, much higher than those of Ni-N4 SAC, and being one of the best reported electrocatalysts for CO2-to-CO conversion to date.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Several cases of renal injury and serum electrolytes disturbances have been reported in IFO-treated patients. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are suspected of being involved in the mechanism of IFO nephrotoxicity. Carnosine is a dipeptide which its antioxidant and mitochondria protecting properties have been mentioned in different experimental models. The current study aimed to evaluate the nephroprotective properties of carnosine against IFO-induced renal injury.Rats were treated with IFO (50 mg/kg, i.p) alone or in combination with carnosine. Serum and urine biomarkers of renal injury in addition to kidney markers of oxidative stress were evaluated. Moreover, kidney mitochondria were isolated, and some mitochondrial indices were assessed.Elevated serum creatinine and BUN, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia, in addition, to an increase in urine glucose, protein, γ-GT, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), were evident in IFO-treated animals. IFO also caused an increase in kidney reactive  species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Renal GSH levels and antioxidant capacity were also depleted with IFO therapy. Mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, GSH level, membrane potential, and ATP content were decreased while mitochondrial LPO and permeabilization were increased in IFO group. Carnosine (250 and 500 mg/kg, i.p) mitigated IFO-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment in renal tissue.Our data suggest mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress as fundamental mechanisms of renal injury induced by IFO.

In addition, miR210 reduced the rate of hepatocyte apoptosis. Intravital imaging after MSC administration showed that both cell types were primarily trapped in the lungs. Relatively a few hypoMSCs and norMSCs migrated to the liver. There were no significant differences in their distributions.The therapeutic effect of hypoMSCs was mediated by PGE2 and miR210 production and was greater than that of norMSCs. Therefore, MSCs can be manipulated to improve their therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of liver cirrhosis and could potentially serve in effective cell therapy. MSCs produce several factors with multidirectional effects and function as "conducting cells" in liver cirrhosis.© 2019 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.

We studied the long term effects of the intrascrotal administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) during detorsion procedure in a rat model of testicular torsion.Twenty-eight rats were divided into 4 groups: (1) Control group: No procedure was done (2): Torsion-detorsion group: Testis torsion applied for 3 h (3): Low Dose Group: After testis torsion-detorsion (for 3 h) 10 mg/kg NAC was given into tunica vaginalis (4): High Dose Group: After testis torsion-detorsion (for 3 h) 100 mg/kg NAC was given into tunica vaginalis. We measured dimensions of the testes and examined pathological findings and Johnsen and Cosantino Scores.For testes height and volume, high dose NAC group had better results than the torsion-detorsion group (p = 0.019, p = 0.049). Testes weight showed no difference (p = 0.204). Sertoli cell number per tubule in the high dose NAC group was statistically different than the torsion-detorsion group (p = 0.017).When NAC was given intrascrotally at a dose of 100 mg/kg, it decreased the loss of testis volume and height, and Sertoli cell number per tubule was similar to the control group. These results suggest that the higher dose intrascrotal NAC administered during detorsion may have a protective effect.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Treatment with beta-adrenoceptor (ADRB) antagonists (beta-blockers) is associated with induction or aggravation of psoriasis-like skin inflammation, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Herein, we identify lysosomotropic beta-blockers as critical inducers of IL23A in human monocyte-derived Langerhans-like cells under sterile-inflammatory conditions. Cytokine release was not mediated by cAMP, suggesting the involvement of ADRB-independent pathways. NFKB/NF-κB and MAPK14/p38 activation was required for propranolol-induced IL23A secretion whereas the NLRP3 inflammasome was dispensable. MAPK14 regulated recruitment of RELB to  promoter regions. Without affecting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, propranolol increased lysosomal pH and induced a late-stage block in macroautophagy/autophagy. Propranolol specifically induced reactive  species production, which was critical for IL23A secretion, in Langerhans-like cells. Our findings provide insight into a potentially crucial immunoregulatory mechanism in cutaneous dendritic cells that may explain how lysosomotropic drugs regulate inflammatory responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674087>Atypical Hybrid Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) Made from Combinative Process of MOF-on-MOF Growth, Etching, and Structure Transformation.</a></h2><p>The structural, compositional, and morphological features of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are most important key factors, which determine their properties, and hence applications. Therefore, the construction of hybrid MOFs with complicated structures, components, or morphologies is significant for the development of well-organized MOFs. Here, we report the advanced route for the construction of atypical hybrid MOFs with unique morphologies and complicated components through the combination of three distinctive processes: MOF-on-MOF growth of 3D ZIF (zeolitic imidazolate framework) on a ZIF-L template, etching of a part of the 2D ZIF-L template, and structural transformation of 2D ZIF-L to 3D ZIF. The formation of core-shell-type MOF rings and plates is controlled by regulating the progress of three processes. The unique formation route for the core-shell-type MOF rings and plates was comprehensively monitored and confirmed by tracking their changes in the morphology, structure, and composition. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept, carbon materials prepared from the pyrolysis of resulting core-shell-type hybrid MOFs displayed enhanced  reduction reaction activities compared to their monomeric counterparts.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the effects of exosomes from human urine-derived stem cells (USC-Exos) in neurogenesis remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether USC-Exos enhanced neurogenesis and promoted functional recovery in brain ischaemia. By using an experimental stroke rat model, we found that intravenous injection of USC-Exos enhanced neurogenesis and alleviated neurological deficits in post-ischaemic stroke rats. We used neural stem cells (NSCs) subjected to -glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) as an in vitro model of ischaemic stroke. The in vitro results suggested that USC-Exos promoted both proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSCs after OGD/R. Notably, a further mechanism study revealed that the pro-neurogenesis effects of USC-Exos may be partially attributed to histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibition via the transfer of exosomal microRNA-26a (miR-26a). Taken together, this study indicates that USC-Exos can be used as a novel promising strategy for brain ischaemia, which highlights the application of USC-Exos.© 2019 The Authors.

We describe oxylipins as direct biocidal agents and propose that structure-function relationships play here a pivotal role. Based on their chemical configuration, POs, such as reactive  and electrophile species, activate defence-related gene expression. We also propose that their ability to interact with pathogen membranes is important, but still misunderstood, and that they are involved in cross-kingdom communication. Taken as a whole, the current literature suggests that POs have a high potential as biocontrol agents. However, the mechanisms underlying these multifaceted compounds remain largely unknown.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, nanocrystalline ferrihydrite (NFH) was prepared to activate PMS for the degradation of butyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (BHB). XPS analysis indicates that calcination process played a key role in regulating the surface  species of NFH, thus control its activation ability toward PMS. NFH exhibits excellent stability (the released concentration of Fe ions < 0.13 mg/L) and desirable reusability. Increasing solution temperature and NFH dosage exerted a positive role in PMS activation for BHB removal, while such positive correlation was not found in the case of increasing initial pH. Increasing the static solution dissolved  remarkably enhanced BHB oxidation kinetics. However, continuous N and air blowing caused a significant decline in BHB removal. Reaction mechanism study showed that SO, OH, O, and O were the main reactive  species for degrading BHB by NFH/PMS. LC/MS analysis indicated BHB was degraded by the pathways of hydroxylation, carboxylation, decarboxylation, dehydrogenation, ring cleavage and chain cleavage reaction. This work suggests the ferrihydrite might be a promising catalyst to activate PMS to destroy refractory organic pollutants in the environmental remediation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Plants have a complex redox system, involving enzymatic and non-enzymatic compounds. The evolutionary origin of enzymatic antioxidant defense in plants is yet unclear. Here, we describe the redox gene network for A. thaliana and investigate the evolutionary origin of this network. We gathered from public repositories 246 A. thaliana genes directly involved with ROS metabolism and proposed an A. thaliana redox gene network. Using orthology information of 238 Eukaryotes from STRINGdb, we inferred the evolutionary root of each gene to reconstruct the evolutionary history of A. thaliana antioxidant gene network. We found two interconnected clusters: one formed by SOD-related, Thiol-redox, peroxidases, and other oxido-reductase; and the other formed entirely by class III peroxidases. Each cluster emerged in different periods of evolution: the cluster formed by SOD-related, Thiol-redox, peroxidases, and other oxido-reductase emerged before opisthokonta-plant divergence; the cluster composed by class III peroxidases emerged after opisthokonta-plant divergence and therefore contained the most recent network components. According to our results, class III peroxidases are in expansion throughout plant evolution, with new orthologs emerging in each evaluated plant clade divergence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665954>Measurement of CMRO and its relationship with CBF in hypoxia with an extended calibrated BOLD method.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670168>Effect of metals of treated electroplating industrial effluents on antioxidant defense system in the microalga Chlorella vulgaris.</a></h2><p>The microalga Chlorella vulgaris is one of the prominent and most widely distributed green microalgae found in aquatic environments, often used in toxicity tests due to its sensitivity to various pollutants. To examine the toxicity of metals found in the effluent discharges from an electroplating industry, physicochemical parameters in the microalga C. vulgaris were measured. pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, color, and the concentrations of metals such as chromium (1.97 mg/L), mercury (104.2 mg/L), and zinc (167.25 mg/L) were found exceeding the permissible limits. Several endpoints such as total protein content, reactive  species (ROS) production, photosynthetic pigment contents, and antioxidant enzymatic activities, including those of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), were measured in C. vulgaris in response to treated electroplating industrial effluent (TEPIE). In addition, concentration-dependent morphological changes were also observed in response to TEPIE. Under both acute and chronic TEPIE exposure, increase in the ROS level was observed indicating increased production of ROS in C. vulgaris cells. The total protein and chlorophyll contents were found to be gradually decreasing in an effluent concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, lower concentrations of effluent stimulated the antioxidant enzyme systems. A concentration-dependent increase was observed in both SOD and CAT enzymatic activities. The results indicated toxic impairments by the effluent on the function of C. vulgaris in response to both acute and chronic exposure, indicating an urgent need of proper treatment processes/modification of the existing one of TEPIE, with continuous monitoring of the discharge of the pollutants into the aquatic ecosystems using biological assays.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, rational design of electrocatalysts with suitably high efficiencies and stabilities in strongly acidic electrolytes remains a significant challenge. Here, we show the first demonstration of sub-10 nm, composition-tunable Rh-Ir alloy nanoparticles (NPs) prepared using a scalable microwave-assisted method as superior acidic OER catalysts. The OER activities showed a volcano-shaped dependence on Ir composition, with Ir-rich NPs (Ir ≥51%) achieving better OER performance than pure Ir NPs, as reflected by lower overpotentials and higher mass activities. Most significantly, Rh22Ir78 NPs achieved a maximum mass activity of 1.17 A·mg-1Ir at a 300 mV overpotential in 0.5 M H2SO4, which corresponds to a 3-fold enhancement relative to pure Ir NPs, making it one of the most active reported OER catalysts under acidic conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that owing to the synergy of ensemble and electronic effects by alloying a small amount of Rh with Ir, the binding energy difference of the O and OOH intermediates is reduced, leading to faster kinetics and enhanced OER activity. Furthermore, Rh-Ir alloy NPs demonstrated excellent durability in strongly acidic electrolyte. This work not only provides fundamental understandings relating to composition-electrochemical performance relationships but also opens new avenues for the rational design of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts for applications in acidic media.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672966>Coulomb-driven single defect engineering for scalable qubits and spin sensors in diamond.</a></h2><p>Qubits based on colour centres in diamond became a prominent system for solid-state quantum information processing and sensing. But the deterministic creation of qubits and the control of their environment are still critical issues, preventing the development of a room-temperature quantum computer. We report on the high creation yield of NV centres of 75% (a tenfold enhancement) by charge-assisted defect engineering, together with an improvement of their spin coherence. The method strongly favours the formation and negative charge state of the NV centres with respect to intrinsic diamond, while it hinders the formation of competing and perturbing defects such as di-vacancies or NVH complexes. We evidence spectrally the charge state tuning of the implantation-induced vacancies from V to V, key element of this Coulomb-driven engineering. The generality of the method is demonstrated using several donors (phosphorous,  and sulphur) and applying it to other centres (SnV and MgV) in diamond.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673891>Benefits and risks of low molecular weight heparin in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h2><p>Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is an anticoagulant that has recently been found benefit in the acute exacerbation stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). But its efficacy is controversial. The objective of this paper is to compare the harm/benefit of LMWH combined with conventional therapy versus single conventional therapy in the acute exacerbation stage of COPD.PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, and Clinical Trials.gov were searched from inception until March 2019. Randomized control trials were included if they reported the use of LMWH for the treatment of COPD. Continuous variable data were reported as mean difference (MD), risk difference (RD), and Peto odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% CIs.Twelve RCTs (N = 1086 subjects) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results exhibited that LMWH treatment significantly improved the levels of arterial partial pressure of  (PaO) (MD = 4.58, 95% CI: 1.78-7.39, P = 0.001), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (MD = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.09-0.29, P = 0.0002), and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) (MD = 10.44, 95% CI: 5.40-15.48, P < 0.0001), and significantly reduced the risk of thrombosis (RD, - 0.03; 95% CI, - 0.07 to 0.00; P = 0.05). There was a marginally but nonsignificant improvement in PaCO levels vs non-LMWH treatment. Moreover, pooled results exhibited that LMWH may increase the risk of hemorrhage. Subgroup analyses exhibited that LMWH treatment only was associated with a significantly increased risk of minor bleeding but not major hemorrhage.When compared with single conventional therapy, addition of LMWH to conventional therapy may provide more clinical benefits in the acute exacerbation stage of COPD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671658>Fighting Hypoxia to Improve PDT.</a></h2><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has drawn great interest in recent years mainly due to its low side effects and few drug resistances.

The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis involves a number of risk factors and complex events including hypercholesterolemia, endothelial dysfunction, increased permeability to low density lipoproteins (LDL) and their sequestration on extracellular matrix in the intima of lesion-prone areas. These events promote LDL modifications, particularly by oxidation, which generates acute and chronic inflammatory responses implicated in atherogenesis and lesion progression. Reactive  species (ROS) (which include both free radical and non-free radical  intermediates), play a key-role at each step of atherogenesis, in endothelial dysfunction, LDL oxidation, and inflammatory events involved in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis lesions. Most advanced knowledge supporting the "oxidative theory of atherosclerosis" i.e. the nature and the cellular sources of ROS and antioxidant defences, as well as the mechanisms involved in the redox balance, is based on the use of genetically engineered animals, i.e. transgenic, genetically modified, or altered for systems producing or neutralizing ROS in the vessels. This review summarizes the results obtained from animals genetically manipulated for various sources of ROS or antioxidant defences in the vascular wall, and their relevance (advance or limitation), for understanding the place and role of ROS in atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019.

However, there is little information for tropical forest soils, which present a challenge for δ O measurements due to low available P concentrations. Here we report the use of a rapid ammonium fluoride extraction method (Bray-1) as an alternative to the widely used anion-exchange membrane (AEM) method for quantification of δ O values of available P in tropical forest soils.We compared P concentrations and δ O values of available and microbial P determined by AEM and Bray-1 extraction for a series of tropical forest soils from Panama spanning a steep P gradient. This involved an assessment of the influence of extraction conditions, including temperature, extraction time, fumigation time, and solution-to-soil ratio, on P concentrations and isotope ratios.Depending on the extraction conditions, Bray-1 P concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 66.3 mg P kg across the soils. Extraction time and temperature had only minor effects on Bray-1 P, but concentrations increased markedly as the solution-to-soil ratio increased. In contrast, extraction conditions did not affect Bray-1 δ O values, indicating that Bray-1 provides a robust measure of the isotopic composition of available soil P. For a relatively high P soil, available and fumigation-released (microbial) δ O values determined by Bray-1 extraction (20‰ and 16‰, respectively) were higher than those determined by AEM (18‰ and 12‰, respectively), which we attribute to slightly different P pools extracted by the two methods and/or differences resulting from the longer extraction time for the AEM method.The short extraction time, insensitivity to extraction conditions, and smaller mass of soil required to extract sufficient P for isotopic analysis, make Bray-1 extraction a suitable alternative to the AEM method for the determination of δ O values of available P in tropical soils.This article is protected by copyright.

In this study, we observed that the expression of IF1 was up-regulated in response to electrical pulse stimulation of skeletal muscle cells and in exercized mice and healthy men. IF1 stimulates glucose uptake  AMPK in skeletal muscle cells and primary cultured myoblasts. Reactive  species and Rac family small GTPase 1 (Rac1) function in the upstream and downstream of AMPK, respectively, in IF1-mediated glucose uptake. In diabetic animal models, the administration of recombinant IF1 improved glucose tolerance and down-regulated blood glucose level. In addition, IF1 inhibits ATP hydrolysis by β-F1-ATPase in plasma membrane, thereby increasing extracellular ATP and activating the protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, ultimately leading to glucose uptake. Thus, we suggest that IF1 is a novel myokine and propose a mechanism by which AMPK and Akt contribute independently to IF1-mediated improvement of glucose tolerance impairment.

Twelve (6 females and 6 males) amateur athletes familiarized with all experimental procedures had their anthropometric data obtained on day 1. On days 2 and 3 either 8 mg of TER or a placebo (PLA) was administered orally (double-blind manner) to participants who had rested for 3 h prior to aerobic exercise performance 20 m multistage fitness test (MSFT)]. This test was used to predict maximal  uptake (VO) and velocity at which VO occurs (vVO). The Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE), cardiovascular variables [heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP)] and blood glucose concentration [BGC] were obtained 15 min pre- and immediately post-MSFT. Significant mean group differences were reported between PLA and TER groups (p < 0.05), respectively, in the RPE (15.6 ± 1.2 vs. 17.3 ± 1.5 a.u.), maximum heart rate (HR: 191.2 ± 7.1 vs. 197.2 ± 8.6 bpm) and BGC (118.4 ± 18.3 vs. 141.2 ± 15.8 mg/dL) post-MSFT.

High altitude (HA) may be involved in IOP, but the reported results were conflicting. Ascent to HA directly by plane from low altitude regions is an acute, effortless exposure. However, the effects of such exposure to different altitudes on IOP have rarely been reported.To investigate changes in IOP after rapid effortless exposure to HA in stages and compare it with systemic parameters.Fifty-eight healthy subjects (116 eyes) were divided into three groups: 17 low-altitude (LA) residents [44 m above sea level (ASL)], 22 HA residents (2261 m ASL) and 19 very HA (VHA) residents (3750 m ASL). The LA group flew to HA first. Three days later, they flew with the HA group to VHA where both groups stayed for 2 d. Then, the LA group flew back to HA and stayed for 1 d before flying back to 44 m. IOP,  saturation (SpO) and pulse rate were measured. The linear mixed model was used to compare repeated measurements.IOP in the LA group significantly decreased from 18.41 ± 2.40 mmHg at 44 m to 13.60 ± 3.68 mmHg at 2261 m ASL ( < 0.001), and then to 11.85 ± 2.48 mmHg at 3750 m ASL ( = 0.036 compared to IOP at 2261 m ASL) and partially recovered to 13.47 ± 2.57 mmHg upon return to 44 m. IOP in the LA group at HA and VHA was comparable to that in the local residents (12.2 ± 2.4 mmHg for HA,11.5 ± 1.8 mmHg for VHA). IOP was positively associated with SpO.IOP in the LA group gradually reduced as altitude elevated in stages and became comparable to IOP in local residents. Hypoxia may be associated with IOP, which deserves further study.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.</p></html>
