The treatment of rats with melanin along with GNPs induced dramatic changes in all the measured biochemical parameters. Our data demonstrated that melanin completely inhibited inflammatory  damage, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation, which was confirmed by the histological investigation of different  sections stained by H&E.These results suggest the beneficial use of melanin together with GNPs for alleviating its toxicity. Other studies should be implemented taking into consideration the role of melanin in comparison with other natural antioxidants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30098557>Non-targeted metabolomics reveals alterations in  and plasma of gilt-head bream exposed to oxybenzone.</a></h1><p>The extensive use of the organic UV filter oxybenzone has led to its ubiquitous occurrence in the aquatic environment, causing an ecotoxicological risk to biota. Although some studies reported adverse effects, such as reproductive toxicity, further research needs to be done in order to assess its molecular effects and mechanism of action. Therefore, in the present work, we investigated metabolic perturbations in juvenile gilt-head bream (Sparus aurata) exposed over 14 days via the water to oxybenzone (50 mg/L). The non-targeted analysis of brain,  and plasma extracts was performed by means of UHPLC-qOrbitrap MS in positive and negative modes with both C18 and HILIC separation. Although there was no mortality or alterations in general physiological parameters during the experiment, and the metabolic profile of brain was not affected, the results of this study showed that oxybenzone could perturb both  and plasma metabolome. The pathway enrichment suggested that different pathways in lipid metabolism ( acid elongation, α-linolenic acid metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated  acids and  acid metabolism) were significantly altered, as well as metabolites involved in phenylalanine and  metabolism. Overall, these changes are signs of possible oxidative stress and energy metabolism modification. Therefore, this research indicates that oxybenzone has adverse effects beyond the commonly studied hormonal activity, and demonstrates the sensitivity of metabolomics to assess molecular-level effects of emerging contaminants.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This suggests that down-regulating APOC3 expression is a potential way of regulating lipid levels. In this study, we used luciferase reporter screening to identify a natural compound, alantolactone (ALA), that can inhibit the promoter activity of APOC3. ALA decreased APOC3 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Then we pretreated L02  cells with oxLDL to investigate the function of ALA in lipid homeostasis. Intriguingly, ALA attenuated oxLDL-induced foam cell formation by reducing total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) contents. Furthermore, these results could be reversed by overexpressing APOC3 protein. ALA inhibited  phosphorylation (Tyr705pho) of STAT3 to down-regulate APOC3 expression. Intriguingly, overexpression of a wild-type STAT3 or a constitutively active form of STAT3 (STAT3-C) up-regulated APOC3 expression and partly reversed the effect of ALA in oxLDL-induced L02 cells. Overexpression of wild-type STAT3 also increased TC but not TG contents in L02 cells. However, overexpression of STAT3-C significantly increased TC and TG contents, and the effect of ALA was partly attenuated by STAT3-C, although this was not statistically significant. These results suggest that ALA attenuates lipid accumulation through down-regulation of APOC3 expression, at least in part by inhibiting STAT3 signaling.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

As one of the genetic factors, PNPLA3 rs738409 (I148M) is important to associate with pathogenesis of NAFLD. Because other SNPs remain unclear in Japan, we performed a high-throughput sequencing that targeted more than 1000 genes to identify a novel genetic variant in Japanese patients with NAFLD.The present study in 36 NAFLD patients and 27 healthy volunteers was performed. A high-throughput sequencer was used to detect the gene variations. Candidate genes were validated by TaqMan SNP genotyping assay in 53 NAFLD patients and 41 healthy volunteers. To investigate the function of candidate gene, we performed biochemical analyses in cultured hepatocytes and  tissues.EXO1 rs1047840, PTPRD rs35929428, IFNAR2 rs2229207, CPOX rs1131857, IL23R rs1884444, IL10RA rs2228055, and FAM3B rs111988437 were identified as candidate genetic variants, and PTPRD rs35929428 was only extracted as a SNP predicting to cause protein dysfunction. In validation analysis, PTPRD rs35929428 associated with the development of NAFLD (P = 0.015, odds ratio = 5.00, 95% confidence interval: 1.33-18.70). In addition, PTPRD rs35929428 was associated with Fib-4 index and with hepatic fat droplets. Biochemical analyses indicated that PTPRD rs35929428 promoted dephosphorylation of  705 signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Tyr 705) in hepatocytes.PTPRD rs35929428 was a novel SNP in patients with NAFLD. Through exacerbation of the dephosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Tyr 705) in hepatocytes, PTPRD rs35929428 might play a role in hepatic lipid accumulation and fibrosis, followed by the development of NAFLD.© 2017 The Authors Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology published by Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28513320>CRISPR/Cas9-based Pten knock-out and Sleeping Beauty Transposon-mediated Nras knock-in induces hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic lipid accumulation in mice.</a></h1><p>Both Pten and Nras are downstream mediators of receptor  kinase activation that plays important roles in controlling cell survival and proliferation. Here, we investigated whether and how Pten loss cross-talks with Nras activation in driving  cancer development in mice. Somatic disruption of hepatic Pten and overexpression of Nras were achieved in out-bred immunocompetent CD-1 mice through a hydrodynamic delivery of plasmids carrying Sleeping Beauty transposon-based integration of Nras and the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Pten knockout system. Concurrent Pten knockout and Nras knock-in induced hepatocellular carcinoma, while individual gene manipulation failed. Tumor development was associated with  fibrosis, hyperlipidemia, hepatic deposition of lipid droplets and glycogen, and hepatomegaly. At the molecular level, lipid droplet formation was primarily contributed by upregulated expression of genes responsible for lipogenesis and  acid sequestration, such as Srebpf1, Acc, Pparg and its downstream targets. Our findings demonstrated that Pten disruption was synergized by Nras overexpression in driving hepatocyte malignant transformation, which correlated with extensive formation of lipid droplets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26579441>Bile acids and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 in hepatic lipid metabolism.</a></h1><p>The  is the central organ involved in lipid metabolism. Dyslipidemia and its related disorders, including non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), obesity and other metabolic diseases, are of increasing public health concern due to their increasing prevalence in the population. Besides their well-characterized functions in cholesterol homoeostasis and nutrient absorption, bile acids are also important metabolic regulators and function as signaling hormones by activating specific nuclear receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, and multiple signaling pathways. Recent studies identified a new signaling pathway by which conjugated bile acids (CBA) activate the extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). CBA-induced activation of S1PR2 is a key regulator of sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) and hepatic gene expression. This review focuses on recent findings related to the role of bile acids/S1PR2-mediated signaling pathways in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28937622>Specificities of Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Developed on Non-Alcoholic  Disease in Absence of Cirrhosis Revealed by Tissue Extracts ¹H-NMR Spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>There is a rising incidence of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) as well as of the frequency of Hepato-Cellular Carcinoma (HCC) associated with NAFLD To seek for putative metabolic pathways specific of the NAFLD etiology, we performed comparative metabolomics between HCC associated with NAFLD and HCC associated with cirrhosis. The study included 28 pairs of HCC tissue versus distant Non-Tumoral Tissue (NTT) collected from patients undergoing hepatectomy. HCC was associated with cirrhosis ( = 9), normal  ( = 6) and NAFLD ( = 13). Metabolomics was performed using 1H-NMR Spectroscopy on tissue extracts and combined to multivariate statistical analysis. In HCC compared to NTT, statistical models showed high levels of lactate and phosphocholine, and low level of glucose. Shared and Unique Structures (SUS) plots were performed to remove the impact of underlying disease on the metabolic profile of HCC. HCC-cirrhosis was characterized by high levels of β-hydroxybutyrate, , phenylalanine and histidine whereas HCC-NAFLD was characterized by high levels of glutamine/glutamate. In addition, the overexpression glutamine/glutamate on HCC-NAFLD was confirmed by both Glutamine Synthetase (GS) immuno-staining and NMR-spectroscopy glutamine quantification. This study provides evidence of metabolic specificities of HCC associated with non-cirrhotic NAFLD versus HCC associated with cirrhosis. These alterations could suggest activation of glutamine synthetase pathway in HCC-NAFLD and mitochondrial dysfunction in HCC-cirrhosis, that may be part of specific carcinogenic processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153579>Phosphorylation of protein kinase B, the key enzyme in insulin-signaling cascade, is enhanced in linoleic and arachidonic acid-treated HT29 and HepG2 cells.</a></h1><p>Defects in the insulin-signaling pathway have been implicated in the pathogenesis of impaired glucose uptake, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. However, the specific defects that precipitate these abnormalities are yet to be fully elucidated. After binding to insulin, the plasma membrane-embedded insulin receptor transmembrane protein initiates a cascade of phosphorylation that leads to the activation of protein kinase B (AKT) and subsequently to the initiation of some metabolic actions of insulin. The activities of this receptor, insulin binding, and  kinase activation is dependent on its plasma lipid environment. Published data on the influence of omega-3 and -6 polyunsaturated  acids on insulin response are scarce. Moreover, the findings of the published investigations, most of which used omega-3 and -6, polyunsaturated -acid blends, have been inconclusive. Hence, further, well thought out research is needed. The aim of the current study was to elucidate the effect of treatments with linoleic acid (LNA), arachidonic acid (ARA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), docoshexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on cell membrane composition and consequently on the insulin-signaling pathway and specifically AKT phosphorylation.Human colon adenocarcinoma (HT29) and  hepatocellular (HepG2) cells were treated with or without 40 µM of LNA, ARA, ALA, EPA, or DHA for 48 h, the -acid composition of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from the treated cells by capillary gas liquid chromatograph. Cells were incubated for 30 min with or without human insulin (50 ng/mL), and the phosphorylation of AKT was assessed with the use of Western blotting.The  acids were incorporated in the PtdCho and PtdEtn of both cell lines, but the level of incorporation was higher in HT29. Phosphorylation of AKT increased when HT29 was treated with LNA (P < 0.05) and ARA (P < 0.01) but not with ALA, EPA, or DHA. A similar but non-significant increase in AKT phosphorylation was observed in LNA- and ARA- treated HepG2 cells.The finding of this investigation demonstrates that plasma membrane lipid bilayer enrichment with LNA or ARA treatment enhances insulin action by AKT activation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In a GeneFishing experiment using human preeclamptic placenta, expression of acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase very long chain (ACADVL), which is involved in  acid β-oxidation (FAO), was detected. To investigate the correlation between PE and FAO, this study subjected in vitro BeWo cells and in vivo pregnant mice to oxidative stress induced by hypoxia. Hypoxic condition, which oxygen supply is insufficient in cells and placenta, created a similar state to placental oxidative stress in PE, as evidenced by increased hypoxic (oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha subunit) and preeclamptic markers (soluble fms-like  kinase 1) both in vitro and in vivo. Increased expression of FAO-related genes (ACADVL, enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase) was observed in these models as well as in cases of preeclamptic preterm labor. In the in vivo  model, messenger RNA expression of gluconeogenesis-related genes increased. Consequently, these results suggest that expression of FAO-related genes is regulated by hypoxic conditions and onset time of PE and affects maternal gluconeogenesis during pregnancy in patients with PE.© The Author(s) 2016.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28110193>Effects of polyphenol compounds melanin on NAFLD/NASH prevention.</a></h1><p>One of the pathogenic mechanisms of the progression non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). So, antioxidant therapy is necessary for successful treatment of the  injury. We have paid attention to melanin produced by yeast Nadsoniella nigra strain X-1 as novel antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents with low toxicity. In current study we aimed to investigate the preventive effect of melanin on the monosodium glutamate (MSG) induced NAFLD model in rats.The study was carried out on 45 Wistar rats that were divided into 3 groups: intact, MSG- and MSG+melanin groups (n=15 in each group). Newborn rats of MSG- and MSG+melanin groups were administered with MSG (4mg/g, 8μl/g, subcutaneously) at 2nd-10th days of life. Since the age of 1 month, rats of MSG-group were treated with water (0.25ml/100g), rats of MSG+melanin groups-with melanin (1mg/kg) dissolved in water (0.25ml/100g).had been performed intermittently (two-week courses alternated with two-week breaks) for 3 months. In 4-month rats anthropometrical parameters and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass were estimated. To assess morphological changes in  we used NAS (NAFLD activity score). The content of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-12Bp40, interferon (INF)-γ) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, tumor growth factor (TGF)-β) were measured by ELISA.We found significantly lower total score (1.0±0.19 vs 3.33±0.36, p<0.001), degree of steatosis (0.73±0.18 vs 1.80±0.17, p<0.001) and manifestation of lobular inflammation (0.27±0.11 vs 1.20±0.17, p<0.001) due to NAFLD activity score in MSG+melanin group compared to MSG-obesity. NASH we confirmed only in 33.3% of rats with MSG-obesity that was significantly higher than after melanin (6.7%) administration (p=0.033). Melanin administration reduce amount of visceral fat on 44.5% (p<0.001) as compared to MSG-obesity group. Melanin reduced the content of IL-1β in rat serum and restored the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β) to the control values.Thus, the administration of melanin can prevent development of NAFLD/NASH in rats with MSG-induced obesity and can be considered as possible novel therapeutic agents but further studies to confirm its action needed.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative modulator of insulin and cytokine signaling, is a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes and obesity. We investigated the impact of PTP1B deficiency during NAFLD, particularly in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).NASH features were evaluated in livers from wild-type (PTP1BWT) and PTP1B-deficient (PTP1BKO) mice fed methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) for 8 weeks. A recovery model was established by replacing MCD to chow diet (CHD) for 2-7 days. Non-parenchymal  cells (NPCs) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Oval cells markers were measured in human and mouse livers with NASH, and in oval cells from PTP1BWT and PTP1BKO mice.PTP1BWT mice fed MCD for 8 weeks exhibited NASH, NPCs infiltration, and elevated Fgf21, Il6 and Il1b mRNAs. These parameters decreased after switching to CHD. PTP1B deficiency accelerated MCD-induced NASH. Conversely, after switching to CHD, PTP1BKO mice rapidly reverted NASH compared to PTP1BWT mice in parallel to the normalization of serum triglycerides (TG) levels. Among NPCs, a drop in cytotoxic natural killer T (NKT) subpopulation was detected in PTP1BKO livers during recovery, and in these conditions M2 macrophage markers were up-regulated. Oval cells markers (EpCAM and cytokeratin 19) significantly increased during NASH only in PTP1B-deficient livers. HGF-mediated signaling and proliferative capacity were enhanced in PTP1BKO oval cells. In NASH patients, oval cells markers were also elevated.PTP1B elicits a dual role in NASH progression and reversion. Additionally, our results support a new role for PTP1B in oval cell proliferation during NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Thus, we evaluated a) if subjects with NAFLD without obesity (NAFLD-NO) compared to those with obesity (NAFLD-Ob) display altered plasma AAs compared to controls (CTs); and b) if AA concentrations are associated with IR and  histology. Glutamic acid, serine, and glycine concentrations are known to be altered in NAFLD. Because these AAs are involved in glutathione synthesis, we hypothesized they might be related to the severity of NAFLD. We therefore measured the AA profile of 44 subjects with NAFLD without diabetes and who had a  biopsy (29 NAFLD-NO and 15 NAFLD-Ob) and 20 CTs without obesity, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, hepatic IR (Hep-IR; Hep-IR = endogenous glucose production × insulin), and the new glutamate-serine-glycine (GSG) index (glutamate/[serine + glycine]) and tested for an association with  histology. Most AAs were increased only in NAFLD-Ob subjects. Only alanine, glutamate, isoleucine, and valine, but not leucine, were increased in NAFLD-NO subjects compared to CTs. Glutamate, , and the GSG-index were correlated with Hep-IR. The GSG-index correlated with  enzymes, in particular, gamma-glutamyltransferase (R = 0.70), independent of body mass index. Ballooning and/or inflammation at  biopsy were associated with increased plasma BCAAs and aromatic AAs and were mildly associated with the GSG-index, while only the new GSG-index was able to discriminate fibrosis F3-4 from F0-2 in this cohort.Increased plasma AA concentrations were observed mainly in subjects with obesity and NAFLD, likely as a consequence of increased IR and protein catabolism. The GSG-index is a possible marker of severity of  disease independent of body mass index.

Free  acids (FFAs) are known to induce lipoapoptosis in  cells in a c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent, but death receptor-independent way (2). As non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with hyperinsulinemia and increased FFA-blood levels, the interplay between insulin and FFA was studied with regard to hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis in isolated rat and mouse hepatocytes. Saturated long chain FFAs induced apoptosis and JNK activation in primary rat hepatocytes, but did not activate the CD95 (Fas, APO-1) system, whereas insulin triggered EGFR activation and hepatocyte proliferation. Coadministration of insulin and FFAs, however, abolished hepatocyte proliferation and triggered CD95-dependent apoptosis due to a JNK-dependent association of the activated EGFR with CD95, subsequent CD95  phosphorylation and formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). JNK inhibition restored the proliferative insulin effect in presence of FFAs and prevented EGFR/CD95 association, CD95  phosphorylation and DISC formation. Likewise, in presence of FFAs insulin increased apoptosis in hepatocytes from wild type but not from Alb-Cre-FAS(fl/fl) mice, which lack functional CD95. It is concluded that FFAs can shift insulin-induced hepatocyte proliferation toward hepatocyte apoptosis by triggering a JNK signal, which allows activated EGFR to associate with CD95 and to trigger CD95-dependent apoptosis. Such phenomena may contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30141235>Markedly higher sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in a woman with acute  of pregnancy compared with HELLP syndrome.</a></h1><p>To compare serum levels of angiogenesis-related factors between 14 women with HELLP (hemolysis, elevated  enzymes and low platelet count) syndrome and a woman with acute  of pregnancy (AFLP).Serum samples were collected in 2004-2008 and 2013-2016. The levels of soluble fms-like  kinase 1 (sFlt-1) and placental growth factor (PlGF) were measured by an automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay using Elecsys sFlt-1 and Elecsys PlGF. After logarithmic transformation, levels of sFlt-1, PlGF and the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in a woman with AFLP were compared with those in women with HELLP syndrome, using the one-sample t-test.At 37 weeks of gestation, a patient was diagnosed with AFLP based on Swansea criteria (showing six features including elevated transaminases), and she also showed a duodenal ulcer with active bleeding, thrombocytopenia and hypertension. Her serum levels of sFlt-1 and sFlt-1/PlGF ratio were significantly higher than in those with HELLP syndrome (273 040 pg/mL vs 15 135 [mean], P < 0.001; 4236 vs 224, P < 0.001; respectively). However, her serum level of PlGF was not significantly different from those with HELLP syndrome.Serum levels of sFlt-1 and the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio, but not PlGF, in a woman with AFLP were markedly higher than those in women with HELLP syndrome. AFLP may be a different clinical entity from HELLP syndrome based on angiogenesis-related factors. Clinically, the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio may be used to rapidly distinguish AFLP from HELLP syndrome.© 2018 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28710282>Function of inhibitor of Bruton's  kinase isoform α (IBTKα) in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis links autophagy and the unfolded protein response.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (steatosis) is the most prevalent  disease in the Western world. One of the advanced pathologies is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is associated with induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and disruption of autophagic flux. However, the mechanisms by which these processes contribute to the pathogenesis of human diseases are unclear. Herein, we identify the α isoform of the inhibitor of Bruton's  kinase (IBTKα) as a member of the UPR, whose expression is preferentially translated during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We found that IBTKα is located in the ER and associates with proteins LC3b, SEC16A, and SEC31A and plays a previously unrecognized role in phagophore initiation from ER exit sites. Depletion of IBTKα helps prevent accumulation of autophagosome intermediates stemming from exposure to saturated free  acids and rescues hepatocytes from death. Of note, induction of IBTKα and the UPR, along with inhibition of autophagic flux, was associated with progression from steatosis to NASH in  biopsies. These results indicate a function for IBTKα in NASH that links autophagy with activation of the UPR.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29852391>Increased hepatic FAT/CD36, PTP1B and decreased HNF4A expression contributes to dyslipidemia associated with ethanol-induced  dysfunction: Rescue effect of ginger extract.</a></h1><p>The association between chronic alcohol consumption and the development of alcpholic  disease is a very well known phenomenon, but the precise underlying molecular mediators involved in ethanol-induced  disease remain elusive. This study aimed to characterize the lipid metabolism alterations and the molecular mediators which are related to lipid metabolism in  under the heavy ethanol exposure alone or combined with ginger extract. Twenty-four male wistar rats were assigned into three groups, namely control, ethanol, and ginger extract treated ethanol (GETE) groups. Six weeks after the treatment, the ethanol group showed a significant increase in  acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and decrease hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 Alpha (HNF4A) genes expressions compared to the control group. The ethanol administration also significantly increased plasma LDL, cholesterol, triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) compared to the control group. Moreover, compared to the control group, the ethanol group showed  histhological changes, such as fibrosis, focal microvesicular steatosis, some apoptotic hepatocytes, spotty necrosis, portal lymphocytic inflammation, mallory-denk bodies, giant mitochondria, piecemeal necrosis. Consumption of ginger extract along with ethanol, partially ameliorated gene expression alteration and histological changes, improved undesirable lipid profile and  enzymes changes compare to those in the ethanol group. These findings indicate that ethanol-induced  abnormalities may in part be associated with lipid homeostasis changes mediated by overexpression of FAT/CD36, PTP1B and downexpressionof HNF4A genes. It also show that these effects can be reduced by using ginger extract as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It has been proposed that the development of IR is secondary to the accumulation of triacylglycerols and  acids in the muscle and , which is in turn thought to be secondary to an enzymatic defect in mitochondrial beta-oxidation. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the molecules of intermediary metabolism to determine if an alteration in mitochondrial function exists in T2DM patients and, if so, to determine whether this alteration is caused by excess nutrients or an enzymatic defect.Seventy-seven subjects were recruited and divided into four groups (21 T2DM patients, 17 non-diabetic overweight/obese subjects, 20 offspring of T2DM patients, and 19 healthy subjects). Anthropometric parameters were determined by air plethysmography, and biochemical and metabolic parameters were measured, including 31 acylcarnitines (ACs) and 13 amino acids quantified by MS/MS and 67 organic acids measured by GC/MS.Patients with T2DM showed elevation of short-chain ACs (C2, C4), a glycogenic amino acid (valine), a glycogenic and ketogenic amino acid (), and a ketogenic amino acid (leucine) as well as altered excretion of dicarboxylic acids. T2DM offspring with abnormal glucose tolerance test GTT showed increased levels of C16. Subjects in the obese group who were dysglycemic also showed altered urinary excretion of dicarboxylic acids and lower levels of a long-chain AC (C14:2).These results suggest that mitochondrial beta-oxidation is altered in T2DM patients and that the alteration is most likely caused by nutrient overload through a different pathway from that observed in obese subjects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968813>In utero sFlt-1 exposure differentially affects gene expression patterns in fetal .</a></h1><p>The soluble fms-like  kinase factor 1 (sFlt-1) is a major contributor to antiangiogenesis during preeclampsia. However, little is known about the effects of sFlt-1 on fetal health. In this study we aim to evaluate the effects of the sFlt-1 concentration during pregnancy on fetal  physiology. We used adenoviral gene delivery in Sprague-Dawley dams (seven females, 10 weeks old) during mid-gestation (gestational day 8) with adenovirus overexpressing sFlt-1, and age-matched controls (six females, 10 weeks old) with empty adenoviral virus in order to quantify the sFlt-1 concentrations in pregnant dams. Dams exposed to adenoviral sFlt-1 delivery were subdivided into a low (n=4) and high sFlt-1 (n=3) group based on host response to the virus. One-way analysis of variance showed that fetuses (five per dam) exposed to high sFlt-1 concentrations in utero show fetal growth restriction (1.84±0.043 g high sFlt-1 v. 2.32±0.036 g control; mean (M)±s.e.m.; P&lt;0.001), without hypertension or proteinuria in the dams.

In addition, using pyrosequencing, we found that the Ppara enrichment in the high sFlt-1 group is accompanied by decreased methylation of its promoter (1.89±0.097 mean % methylation in high sFlt-1 v. 2.26±0.095 mean % methylation in control, M±s.e.m., P&lt;0.02).

Herein, we aimed to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of UDCA-LPE on pro-fibrogenic integrin signalling. UDCA-LPE treatment of human embryonic  cell line CL48 and primary human hepatic stellate cells induced a non-classical internalization of integrin β1 resulting in dephosphorylation and inhibition of SRC and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Signalling analyses suggested that UDCA-LPE may act as a heterobivalent ligand for integrins and lysophospholipid receptor1 (LPAR1) and co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated the bridging effect of UDCA-LPE on integrin β1 and LPAR1. The disruption of either the UDCA-moiety binding to integrins by RGD-containing peptide GRGDSP or the LPE-moiety binding to LPAR1 by LPAR1 antagonist Ki16425 reversed inhibitory functions of UDCA-LPE. The lack of inhibitory functions of UDCA-PE and UDCA-LPE derivatives (14:0 and 12:0, LPE-moiety containing shorter  acid chain) as well as the consistency of the translocation of UDCA-LPE and integrins, which co-fractionated with LPE but not UDCA, suggested that the observed UDCA-LPE-induced translocation of integrins was mediated by LPE endocytic transport pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29156373>Mitochondria-targeted ubiquinone (MitoQ) enhances acetaldehyde clearance by reversing alcohol-induced posttranslational modification of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2: A molecular mechanism of protection against alcoholic  disease.</a></h1><p>Alcohol metabolism in the  generates highly toxic acetaldehyde. Breakdown of acetaldehyde by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) in the mitochondria consumes NAD and generates reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which represents a fundamental mechanism in the pathogenesis of alcoholic  disease (ALD). A mitochondria-targeted lipophilic ubiquinone (MitoQ) has been shown to confer greater protection against oxidative damage in the mitochondria compared to untargeted antioxidants. The present study aimed to investigate if MitoQ could preserve mitochondrial ALDH2 activity and speed up acetaldehyde clearance, thereby protects against ALD. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to alcohol for 8 weeks with MitoQ supplementation (5mg/kg/d) for the last 4 weeks. MitoQ ameliorated alcohol-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress and glutathione deficiency. It also reversed alcohol-reduced hepatic ALDH activity and accelerated acetaldehyde clearance through modulating ALDH2 cysteine S-nitrosylation,  nitration and 4-hydroxynonenol adducts formation. MitoQ ameliorated nitric oxide (NO) donor-mediated ADLH2 S-nitrosylation and nitration in Hepa-1c1c7 cells under glutathion depletion condition. In addition, alcohol-increased circulating acetaldehyde levels were accompanied by reduced intestinal ALDH activity and impaired intestinal barrier. In accordance, MitoQ reversed alcohol-increased plasma endotoxin levels and hepatic toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-NF-κB signaling along with subsequent inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration. MitoQ also reversed alcohol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation through enhancing  acid β-oxidation. Alcohol-induced ER stress and apoptotic cell death signaling were reversed by MitoQ. This study demonstrated that speeding up acetaldehyde clearance by preserving ALDH2 activity critically mediates the beneficial effect of MitoQ on alcohol-induced pathogenesis at the gut- axis.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Pregnant rats were fed with a control diet or a low protein diet (LPD). Male offspring rats received a LPD during gestation, lactation, and until they were 60 days old (MM group), a late LPD that began after weaning (CM), or a LPD administrated only during the gestation-lactation period followed by a control diet (MC). On day 60, blood was collected and the  was dissected out. We found a decrease in MM rats' total body (p < 0.001) and  (p < 0.05) weight. These and CM rats showed obvious  dysfunction reflected by the increase in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGOT) (MM p < 0.001) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) (MM and CM p < 0.001) enzymes, and  content of cholesterol (MM and CM p < 0.001) and triglycerides (MM p < 0.01; CM p < 0.001), in addition to what we saw by histology.  dysfunction was also shown by the increase in gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) (MM, MC, and CM p < 0.001) and GST-pi1 (MM and CM p < 0.001, MC p < 0.05) expression levels. MC rats showed the lowest increment in GST-pi1 expression (MC vs. MM; p < 0.001, MC vs. CM; p < 0.01). ROS production (MM, CM, and MC: p < 0.001), lipid peroxidation (MM, CM, and MC p < 0.001), content of carbonyl groups in  proteins (MM and CM p < 0.001, MC p < 0.01), and total antioxidant capacity (MM, CM, and MC p < 0.001) were increased in the  of all groups of malnourished animals.

Betacyanins possess free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities, suggesting its potential beneficial effects on metabolic diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the metabolic effect of red pitaya (Hylocereus polyrhizus) fruit betacyanins (HPBN) on high-fat diet-fed mice and determine whether the beneficial effects of HPBN are associated with the modulation of gut microbiota.Thirty-six male C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups and fed low-fat diet (LFD), high-fat diet (HFD), or high-fat diet plus HPBN of 200 mg/kg for 14 weeks. Sixteen seconds rRNA sequencing was used to analyze the composition of gut microbiota.Our results indicated that administration of HPBN reduced HFD-induced body weight gain and visceral obesity and improved hepatic steatosis, adipose hypertrophy, and insulin resistance in mice. Sixteen seconds rRNA sequencing performed on the MiSeq Illumina platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) showed that HPBN supplement not only decreased the proportion of Firmicutes and increased the proportion of Bacteroidetes at the phylum level but also induced a dramatic increase in the relative abundance of Akkermansia at the genus level.Red pitaya betacyanins protect from diet-induced obesity and its related metabolic disorders, which is associated with improved inflammatory status and modulation of gut microbiota, especially its ability to decrease the ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and increase the relative abundance of Akkermansia.

SCFA (formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate) are formed by the anaerobic carbohydrates fermentation and branched-chain  acids (BCFA), such as isobutyric and isovaleric acids, are derived from amino acids valine and leucine. Phenylcarboxylic acids (PCA), such as phenylacetic acid (PAA), phenyipropionic acid (PPA), phenyllactic acid (PLA) and some other acids, are metabolites of amino acids phenylalanine and  involved in host adaptation and regulation. ma unique experiment, the authors first examined effect of the carboxylic acids on host cell proliferation in organotypic tissue cultures (rat spleen explants). The study showed that almost all biogenic aliphatic carboxylic acids have a positive effect on cell proliferation in rat spleen tissue. This fundamentally distinguishes them from amino acids, many of which have an inhibitory effect at the same concentrations. These findings suggest that SCFA, including hydrox~ and oxo derivatives, can act as positive regulators of host immune tissues. Some SCFA (for example, butyric acid), stimulate proliferation of normal host cells (immune tissue, intestinal epithelium), but inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells ('butyrate paradox'). Unlike SCFA, phenylcarboxylic acids have a negative effect on host immune tissues explants and induce apoptosis. These data confirm the potential contribution of phenylcarboxylic acids in the pathogenesis of chronic disorders associated with impaired immune response, including autoimmune diseases. The authors suggest that PCA may serve as early metabolic markers of sepsis, immune-related diseases and chronic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (iBD), colorectal cancer, chronic kidney disease and , secondary imrnunodeficiency. It can be assumed that carboxylic acids are evolutionary precursors of amino acids that have a wide variety of functions and able to modulate not only proliferation but also apoptosis. The results agree well with the data obtained in the study of Actoflor-C (microbial metabolites complex) and can be used to study mechanisms of action of probiotic strains and metabiotics (e.g. butyrate and propionate-containing formulations), as well as for the development of innovative medicines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28275212>Long Non-Coding RNA Profiling in a Non-Alcoholic  Disease Rodent Model: New Insight into Pathogenesis.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent chronic  diseases worldwide with an unclear mechanism. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as important regulatory molecules. To better understand NAFLD pathogenesis, lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) microarrays were conducted in an NAFLD rodent model. Potential target genes of significantly changed lncRNA were predicted using /-regulatory algorithms. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were then performed to explore their function. In the current analysis, 89 upregulated and 177 downregulated mRNAs were identified, together with 291 deregulated lncRNAs. Bioinformatic analysis of these RNAs has categorized these RNAs into pathways including arachidonic acid metabolism, circadian rhythm, linoleic acid metabolism, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, sphingolipid metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, tryptophan metabolism and  metabolism were compromised. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of representative nine mRNAs and eight lncRNAs (named -related lncRNA, FLRL) was conducted and this verified previous microarray results. Several lncRNAs, such as FLRL1, FLRL6 and FLRL2 demonstrated to be involved in circadian rhythm targeting period circadian clock 3 (Per3), Per2 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (Arntl), respectively. While FLRL8, FLRL3 and FLRL7 showed a potential role in PPAR signaling pathway through interaction with  acid binding protein 5 (Fabp5), lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) and  acid desaturase 2 (Fads2). Functional experiments showed that interfering of lncRNA FLRL2 expression affected the expression of predicted target, circadian rhythm gene . Moreover, both FLRL2 and Arntl were downregulated in the NAFLD cellular model. The current study identified lncRNA and corresponding mRNA in NAFLD, providing new insight into the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Moreover, we identified a new lncRNA FLRL2, that might participate NAFLD pathogenesis mediated by Arntl.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26628841>Animal Models Correlating Immune Cells for the Development of NAFLD/NASH.</a></h1><p>This review mainly elaborates on the animal models available for understanding the pathogenesis of the second hit of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) involving immune system. This is known to be a step forward from simple steatosis caused during the first hit, which leads to the stage of inflammation followed by more serious  conditions like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. Immune-deficient animal models serve as an important tool for understanding the role of a specific cell type or a cytokine in the progression of NAFLD. These animal models can be used in combination with the already available animal models of NAFLD, including dietary models, as well as genetically modified mouse models. Advancements in molecular biological techniques enabled researchers to produce several new animal models for the study of NAFLD, including knockin, generalized knockout, and tissue-specific knockout mice.

A diet high in saturated fats can induce inflammation and impair leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. However, the role of saturated  acids on hypothalamic leptin signaling, and hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism remains largely undiscovered. In this study, we investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of a saturated  acid, palmitic acid (PA, C16:0), on central leptin sensitivity, hypothalamic leptin signaling, inflammatory molecules and hepatic energy metabolism in C57BL/6J male mice. We found that the icv administration of PA led to central leptin resistance, evidenced by the inhibition of central leptin's suppression of food intake. Central leptin resistance was concomitant with impaired hypothalamic leptin signaling (JAK2-STAT3, PKB/Akt-FOXO1) and a pro-inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6 and pIκBa) in the mediobasal hypothalamus and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei. Furthermore, the pre-administration of icv PA blunted the effect of leptin-induced decreases in mRNA expression related to gluconeogenesis (G6Pase and PEPCK), glucose transportation (GLUT2) and lipogenesis (FAS and SCD1) in the  of mice. Therefore, elevated central PA concentrations can induce pro-inflammatory responses and leptin resistance, which are associated with disorders of energy homeostasis in the  as a result of diet-induced obesity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Shp2/Ptpn11 is a proto-oncogene in hematopoietic cells and antagonizes the effect of tumor suppressor Pten in leukemogenesis. In contrast, we show here cooperative functions of Shp2 and Pten in suppressing hepatocarcinogenesis. Ablating both Shp2 and Pten in hepatocytes induced early-onset non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and promoted genesis of  tumor-initiating cells likely due to augmented cJun expression/activation and elevated ROS and inflammation in the hepatic microenvironment. Inhibiting cJun partially suppressed NASH-driven  tumorigenesis without improving NASH. SHP2 and PTEN deficiencies were detected in  cancer patients with poor prognosis.

Such knowledge led us to examine the potential of glabridin, as a replacement of estrogen anti-inflammatory activity under high-glucose conditions.In macrophage-like cells, chronic glucose stress (28 and 44 mM) upregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression by 42 and 189%, respectively. Pretreatment with glabridin, under chronic glucose stress, downregulated the LPS-induced nitric oxide secretion and nitrotyrosine formation, by 39 and 21%, respectively. Pretreatment with estradiol did not prevent the LPS-induced nitrotyrosine formation. Furthermore, glabridin, brought about a decrease in the LPS-induced iNOS mRNA expression by 48%, as compared to cells pretreated with estradiol. Glabridin decreased protein levels of  iNOS by 69% in adult mouse offspring which developed hyperglycemia after early fetal exposure to a saturated  acid-enriched maternal diet. Glabridin also decreased  nitrotyrosine levels in offspring of regular diet-fed mothers after further receiving high-fat diet.Such results indicate that glabridin retains anti-inflammatory abilities to regulate the synthesis and activity of iNOS under high-glucose levels, implying that a glabridin supplement may serve as an anti-inflammatory agent in diabetes-related vascular dysfunction.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Diagnostic biomarkers for hepatotoxicity have been used to minimize drug-induced  injury and to increase the clinical safety. A metabolomics strategy using rapid-resolution liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (RRLC-MS/MS) analyses and multivariate statistics was implemented to identify potential biomarkers for hydrazine-induced hepatotoxicity. The global serum and urine metabolomics of 30 hydrazine-treated rats at 24 or 48 h postdosing and 24 healthy rats were characterized by a metabolomics approach. Multivariate statistical data analyses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to identify the most significantly altered metabolites. The 16 most significant potential biomarkers were identified to be closely related to hydrazine-induced  injury. The combination of these biomarkers had an area under the curve (AUC) > 0.85, with 100% specificity and sensitivity, respectively. This high-quality classification group included amino acids and their derivatives, glutathione metabolites, vitamins,  acids, intermediates of pyrimidine metabolism, and lipids. Additionally, metabolomics pathway analyses confirmed that phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis as well as  metabolism had great interactions with hydrazine-induced  injury in rats.

The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active microbiota. Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, acetate-produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human diseases is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic dysbiosis (a particular form of dysbiosis) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic dysbiosis is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic dysbiosis. Since in the metabolic dysbiosis metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in colon (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic dysbiosis are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain  acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly deoxycholic acid). These kinds of metabolic dysbiosis can eventually lead to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal cancer (CRC). The metabolic dysbiosis due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and  derivatives (phenyl carboxylic acid, p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic acid, indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS. IBD, CRC, chronic  and kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autism and schizophrenia.

Spiders are considered to be an excellent model for investigating the impacts of heavy metals on the environment. To date, the changes at the molecular level in the cerebral ganglia of spiders are poorly understood. Cd exposure leads to strong damage in the nervous system, such as apoptosis and necrosis of nerve cells, therefore we conducted a transcriptomic analysis of Pardosa pseudoannulata cerebral ganglia under Cd stress to profile differential gene expression (DGE). We obtained a total of 123,328 assembled unigenes, and 1441 Cd stress-associated DEGs between the Cd-treated and control groups. Expression profile analysis demonstrated that many genes involved in calcium signaling, cGMP-PKG signaling,  metabolism, phototransduction-fly, melanogenesis and isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis were up-regulated under Cd stress, whereas oxidative phosphorylation-related, nervous disease-associated, non-alcoholic  disease-associated, and ribosomal-associated genes were down-regulated.

We observed male C57BL/6 mice with a global deletion of the Ron  kinase signaling domain (TK(-/-)) to be leaner compared with control (TK(+/+)) mice under a standard diet. When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), TK(-/-) mice gained 50% less weight and were more insulin sensitive and glucose tolerant than controls. Livers from HFD TK(-/-) mice were considerably less steatotic and weighed significantly less than TK(+/+) livers. Serum cytokine levels of HFD TK(-/-) mice were also significantly altered compared with TK(+/+) mice. Fewer and smaller adipocytes were present in the TK(-/-) mice on both control and HFD and were accompanied by diminished adiponectin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ expression. In vitro adipogenesis experiments suggested reduced differentiation in TK(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that was rescued by Ron reconstitution. Likewise, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 phosphorylation was diminished in TK(-/-) MEFs but was increased after Ron reconstitution. The adipogenic inhibitors, preadipocyte factor 1 and Sox9, were elevated in TK(-/-) MEFs and increased in both groups after STAT3 silencing.

The impaired fat oxidation in obesity condition leads to increased hepatic fat accumulation and increased metabolic syndrome risk. On the other hand, physical exercise has been demonstrated as a potent strategy in the prevention of NAFLD. Also, these beneficial effects of exercise occur through different mechanisms. Recently, the Cdc2-like kinase (CLK2) protein was associated with the suppression of  acid oxidation and hepatic ketogenesis. Thus, obese animals demonstrated elevated levels of hepatic CLK2 and decreased fat acid oxidation. Here, we explored the effects of chronic physical exercise in the hepatic metabolism of obese mice. Swiss mice were distributed in Lean, Obese (fed with high-fat diet during 16 weeks) and Trained Obese group (fed with high-fat diet during 16 weeks and exercised (at 60% exhaustion velocity during 1 h/5 days/week) during 8 weeks. In our results, the obese animals showed insulin resistance, increased hepatic CLK2 content and increased hepatic fat accumulation compared to the Lean group. Otherwise, the chronic physical exercise improved insulin resistance state, prevented the increased CLK2 in the  and attenuated hepatic fat accumulation. In summary, these data reveal a new protein involved in the prevention of hepatic fat accumulation after chronic physical exercise.

We have shown previously that CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress and circulating leptin in NAFLD is associated with renal disease severity. Extending the studies, we hypothesized that high circulatory leptin in NAFLD causes renal mesangial cell activation and tubular inflammation via a NOX2 dependent pathway that upregulates proinflammatory miR21. High-fat diet (60% kcal) was used to induce  phenotype with parallel insulin and leptin resistance. The kidneys were probed for mesangial cell activation and tubular inflammation that showed accelerated NASH phenotype and oxidative stress in the . Results showed that NAFLD kidneys had significant increases in α-SMA, a marker of mesangial cell activation, miR21 levels,  nitration and renal inflammation while they were significantly decreased in leptin and p47 phox knockout mice. Micro RNA21 knockout mice showed decreased tubular immunotoxicity and proinflammatory mediator release. Mechanistically, use of NOX2 siRNA or apocynin,phenyl boronic acid (FBA), DMPO or miR21 antagomir inhibited leptin primed-miR21-mediated mesangial cell activation in vitro suggesting a direct role of leptin-mediated NOX-2 in miR21-mediated mesangial cell activation. Finally, JAK-STAT inhibitor completely abrogated the mesangial cell activation in leptin-primed cells suggesting that leptin signaling in the mesangial cells depended on the JAK-STAT pathway. Taken together the study reports a novel mechanistic pathway of leptin-mediated renal inflammation that is dependent on NOX-2-miR21 axis in ectopic manifestations underlying NAFLD-induced co-morbidities.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Besides their role in cell death, BCL-2 proteins have been implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and cellular metabolism. It remains unclear, however, whether these proteins have a physiological role in glucose homeostasis and metabolism in vivo. In this study, we report that fat accumulation in the  increases c-Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent BCL-2 interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) expression in hepatocytes. To determine the consequences of hepatic BIM deficiency in diet-induced obesity, we generated -specific BIM-knockout (BLKO) mice. BLKO mice had lower hepatic lipid content, increased insulin signaling, and improved global glucose metabolism. Consistent with these findings, lipogenic and lipid uptake genes were downregulated and lipid oxidation enhanced in obese BLKO mice. Mechanistically, BIM deficiency improved mitochondrial function and decreased oxidative stress and oxidation of protein  phosphatases, and ameliorated activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ/sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1/CD36 in hepatocytes from high fat-fed mice. Importantly, short-term knockdown of BIM rescued obese mice from insulin resistance, evidenced by reduced fat accumulation and improved insulin sensitivity.

We evaluated the oral toxicity of isopsoralen in Wistar rats treated for 3 months at doses of 0, 3.5, 7.0, and 14 mg/kg. Additionally, the plasma metabolomics of isopsoralen in male and female rats treated for 3 months at doses of 0 and 14 mg/kg were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Many abnormalities were observed in the isopsoralen-treated rats, including suppression of body weight gain, and changes in serum biochemical parameters and visceral coefficients. Histopathological changes in , pancreatic, and reproductive system tissues were also observed in the isopsoralen-treated rats. The metabolomic analyses showed alterations in many metabolites (19 in female rats; 28 in male rats) after isopsoralen administration. The significant changes in these metabolites revealed metabolomic alterations in the isopsoralen-treated rats, especially in amino acid metabolism regardless of sex, including phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. Furthermore,  acid metabolism comprised the main affected pathways in female rats, while lipid metabolism and energy metabolism were the main affected pathways in male rats.Copyright © 2019.

Exosomes from ADSCs exert protective effects in several diseases, but their roles in obesity and related pathological conditions remain unclear. In this study, we showed that treatment of obese mice with ADSC-derived exosomes facilitated their metabolic homeostasis, including improved insulin sensitivity (27.8% improvement), reduced obesity, and alleviated hepatic steatosis. ADSC-derived exosomes drove alternatively activated M2 macrophage polarization, inflammation reduction, and beiging in white adipose tissue (WAT) of diet-induced obese mice. Mechanistically, exosomes from ADSCs transferred into macrophages to induce anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes through the transactivation of arginase-1 by exosome-carried active STAT3. Moreover, M2 macrophages induced by ADSC-derived exosomes not only expressed high levels of  hydroxylase responsible for catecholamine release, but also promoted ADSC proliferation and lactate production, thereby favoring WAT beiging and homeostasis in response to high-fat challenge. These findings delineate a novel exosome-mediated mechanism for ADSC-macrophage cross talk that facilitates immune and metabolic homeostasis in WAT, thus providing potential therapy for obesity and diabetes.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28025059>MicroRNA-206 prevents hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia by facilitating insulin signaling and impairing lipogenesis.</a></h1><p>The paradox of selective hepatic insulin resistance, wherein the insulin-resistant  fails to suppress glucose production but continues to produce lipids, has been central to the pathophysiology of hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia. Our study was designed to investigate the mechanism(s) by which microRNA-206 alleviates the pathogenesis of hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia.Dietary obese mice induced by a high fat diet were used to study the role of microRNA-206 in the pathogenesis of hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia. A mini-circle vector was used to deliver microRNA-206 into the livers of mice.Lipid accumulation impaired biogenesis of microRNA-206 in  livers of dietary obese mice and human hepatocytes (p<0.01). Delivery of microRNA-206 into the livers of dietary obese mice resulted in the strong therapeutic effects on hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia. Mechanistically, miR-206 interacted with the 3' untranslated region of PTPN1 (protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 1) and induced its degradation. By inhibiting PTPN1 expression, microRNA-206 facilitated insulin signaling by promoting phosphorylation of INSR (insulin receptor) and impaired hepatic lipogenesis by inhibiting Srebp1c transcription. By simultaneously modulating lipogenesis and insulin signaling, microRNA-206 reduced lipid (p=0.006) and glucose (p=0.018) production in human hepatocytes and livers of dietary obese mice (p<0.001 and p<0.01 respectively). Re-introduction of Ptpn1 into livers offset the inhibitory effects of microRNA-206, indicating that PTPN1 mediates the inhibitory effects of microRNA-206 on both hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia.MicroRNA-206 is a potent inhibitor of lipid and glucose production by simultaneously facilitating insulin signaling and impairing hepatic lipogenesis. Our findings potentially provide a novel therapeutic agent for both hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia.The epidemic of obesity is causing a sharp rise in the incidence of insulin resistance and its major complications, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). However, there are no effective treatments because the mechanisms underlying both disorders are not well described. We identified microRNA-206 as a novel and effective inhibitor for both glucose and lipid production in  and potentially provide a unique therapeutic drug for both hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2017 European Association for the Study of the .

To study possible pathways involved, we investigated gene expressions in the  and small intestine of mice fed oats.Cholesterol and bile acids were analyzed in plasma and feces from LDL-receptor deficient (LDLr ) mice fed Western diet with wholegrain oats. A transcriptome analysis of mRNA from  and jejunum was performed together with quantitative RT-PCR. Oat-fed mice had lower levels of plasma lipids and increased levels of bile acids and cholesterol in feces compared with controls. Two hundred thirty nine genes in jejunum and 25 genes in  were differentially expressed (FDR corrected p < 0.05). The most affected biological process in jejunum was lipid biosynthesis and regulation. The apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT, Slc10a) and the intracellular bile acid binding protein (Fabp6) were both upregulated, whereas small heterodimer partner-1 (Shp-1) and apolipoprotein CII (Apoc2) were downregulated.Whole oats attenuated responses typically induced by high-fat diet. Increased expression of genes for intestinal bile acid uptake following oat consumption suggests retention in the gut lumen rather than decreased uptake capacity as cause for the increased bile acid excretion and the concomitant reduction of plasma cholesterol.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These activities are subjected to neural modulation, but characterization of the human pancreatic afferent and efferent nerves remains difficult because of the lack of three-dimensional (3-D) image data. Here we prepare transparent human donor pancreases for 3-D histology to reveal the pancreatic microstructure, vasculature, and innervation in a global and integrated fashion. The pancreatic neural network consists of the substance P (SP)-positive sensory (afferent) nerves, the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT)-positive parasympathetic (efferent) nerves, and the  hydroxylase (TH)-positive sympathetic (efferent) nerves. The SP afferent nerves were found residing along the basal domain of the interlobular ducts. The VAChT and TH efferent nerves were identified at the peri-acinar and perivascular spaces, which follow the blood vessels to the islets. In the intrapancreatic ganglia, the SP (scattered minority, ~7%) and VAChT neurons co-localize, suggesting a local afferent-efferent interaction. Compared with the mouse pancreas, the human pancreas differs in ) the lack of SP afferent nerves in the islet, ) the lower ganglionic density, and ) the obvious presence of VAChT and TH nerves around the intralobular adipocytes. The latter implicates the neural influence on the pancreatic steatosis. Overall, our 3-D image data reveal the human pancreatic afferent and efferent innervation patterns and provide the anatomical foundation for future high-definition analyses of neural remodeling in human pancreatic diseases. Modern three-dimensional (3-D) histology with multiplex optical signals identifies the afferent and efferent innervation patterns of human pancreas, which otherwise cannot be defined with standard histology. Our 3-D image data reveal the unexpected association of sensory and parasympathetic nerves/neurons in the intrapancreatic ganglia and identify the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve contacts with the infiltrated adipocytes. The multiplex approach offers a new way to characterize the human pancreas in remodeling (e.g.,  infiltration and duct lesion progression).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27957651>Carnosic acid protects non-alcoholic -induced dopaminergic neuron injury in rats.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) has been reported to induce cognitive impairments of hippocampus and may influence central nervous system. In the present study, we investigated whether carnosic acid (CA) ameliorates dopaminergic neuron injury in a rat model of NAFLD. In order to induce NAFLD, rats were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks. We found that continued CA administration reduced lipid accumulation marked by decreases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level in the serum. H&E staining revealed that feeding CA reduced lipid droplets accumulation, and alleviated oxidative stress by increasing in superoxide dismutase (SOD) level and decreasing in malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the . In addition, by measuring several parameters of gait analysis, we demonstrated that CA treatment ameliorated behavioral impairments, as evidenced by decreased duration and maximum variation, accompanied by increased average speed and cadence. Furthermore, CA treated-animals displayed an increase in the contents of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacelic acid (DOPAC) and elevated the expressions of  hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) as well as the TH protein in the striatum. Together, these findings suggest that CA may be an effective agent in protecting rats from NAFLD-induced dopaminergic neuron injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826467>Reduced biliverdin reductase-A levels are associated with early alterations of insulin signaling in obesity.</a></h1><p>Biliverdin reductase-A (BVR-A) is a serine/threonine/ kinase involved in the regulation of insulin signaling. In vitro studies have demonstrated that BVR-A is a substrate of the insulin receptor and regulates IRS1 by avoiding its aberrant activation, and in animal model of obesity the loss of hepatic BVR-A has been associated with glucose/insulin alterations and  disease. However, no studies exist in humans. Here, we evaluated BVR-A expression levels and activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from obese subjects and matched lean controls and we investigated the related molecular alterations of the insulin along with clinical correlates. We showed that BVR-A levels are significantly reduced in obese subjects and associated with a hyper-activation of the IR/IRS1/Akt/GSK-3β/AS160/GLUT4 pathway. Low BVR-A levels also associate with the presence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, NASH and visceral adipose tissue inflammation. These data suggest that the reduction of BVR-A may be responsible for early alterations of the insulin signaling pathway in obesity and in this context may represent a novel molecular target to be investigated for the comprehension of the process of insulin resistance development in obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Sorafenib shows efficacy in the management of non-resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is refractory to other chemotherapeutic drugs. HCC represents a major end point of chronic  diseases and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. In HCC patients Sorafenib increases overall survival compared to placebo. The most common chronic  disease affecting up to 30% of the population in Western countries is non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), an intra-hepatic amassing of triglycerides deemed as the hepatic manifestation of insulin resistance and obesity. NAFLD encompasses a range of disorders with grades of  damage varying from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hallmarked by hepatocellular injury/inflammation in the presence or not of fibrosis. NAFLD patients progress to NASH in 10% of cases, which may progress to cirrhosis and HCC. Recent exciting studies uncovered a potential therapeutic role for Sorafenib that goes beyond HCC, and extends to cirrhotic portal hypertensive syndrome during cirrhosis, and to selective anti-fibrotic effects mediated through direct inhibition of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC), the cellular mediators of intra-hepatic matrix deposition. The aim of this review is to concisely summarize our current knowledge of the biology, epidemiology and clinical aspects of HCC, as well as the previously under-appreciated therapeutic efficacy of Sorafenib beyond HCC.

In this study, we utilized a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomics approach to assess endogenous metabolite changes in developing zebrafish embryos exposed to different concentrations of the widely used antidepressant, fluoxetine. Embryos were exposed from 2 h post fertilization (hpf) until 96 hpf. Using the Fiehn GC-MS library, a total of 31 metabolites were positively identified in embryos. Statistical analyses revealed significant dysregulation of 11 metabolites in fluoxetine exposed embryos. Metabolite classes that were significantly altered included, amino acids, monosaccharides, glycerophosphates,  acids, carboxylic acid derivatives and sugars. Concentrations of amino acids, maltose, d-malic acid, 3-phosphoglycerate and d-glucose were significantly reduced in exposed embryos. Conversely, concentrations of citric acid were in some cases significantly elevated in exposed embryos. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed perturbation of five main pathways, including (i) alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, (ii) phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis, (iii) phenylalanine metabolism. (iv)  metabolism and (v) starch and sucrose metabolism. The results indicate fluoxetine exposure causes perturbation of energy and amino acid metabolism, which may adversely impact embryogenesis due to depletion of energy reserves during this period. Also, the observed alterations in aspartic acid, phenylalanine and  in fluoxetine exposed embryos suggests potential disruption of normal neurobehavioral and  function. The results further demonstrate that GC-MS based metabolomics is an effective approach for assessing toxicodynamics and threshold effect levels of environmental pollutants in aquatic organisms.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the mechanism of PACs induced toxicity still remains elusive. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of a typical mixture of PACs found in oil sand extract (OSE) on the respiratory, hepatic and nervous systems in humans using in vitro cell culture models followed by non-targeted metabolomics analysis. OSE collected from Alberta, Canada was fractionated into PAC and alkane fractions, and their effects after 24 h exposure on the cell viability measured by MTT assay in three human cell lines (A549, HepG2, and SK-N-SH) were studied. The PAC fractions showed significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity. A549 cells showed the highest sensitivity to OSE extracts, followed by SK-N-SH and HepG2. In contrast, the alkane fractions showed no effects on cell viability. The three human cell lines were further exposed with the PACs at 10% and 20% lethal concentration for 24 h. Metabolomics analysis of the cell extracts indicated that PACs treatments showed different disruptions on possible metabolic pathways on the three cell lines. PACs altered the sex steroid hormone metabolism and regulated the levels of leukotrienes metabolites in all three cell types. The amino acids L-cysteine, L-glutamine,  that are known to cause respiratory effects were significantly up-regulated in A549 cells. The PACs treated HepG2 cells showed down-regulation in metabolites responsible for the inflammatory mediation. Treatment of the differentiated SK-N-SH cells showed up-regulated metabolites involved with butanoate,  acid, and pyrimidine metabolism. Leukotriene metabolites were found to be significantly increased in all PACs treated cells. In conclusion, our results showed that PACs in OSE can alter the metabolism of the human lung,  and neuronal cells and may induce toxicity in multiple target organs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to analyse the relationship between the JAK2-STAT3 signalling pathway and the ameliorating effect of HGF on NASH.Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks, and then plasma and hepatic tissues were collected. Histological and clinical chemistry assays were performed to assess  disease. The mRNA and protein levels of JAK2, STAT3, and c-Met were assessed by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively.Serum ALT, AST, and TG levels were increased in NASH mice. Histological analysis showed different degrees of steatosis, inflammatory infiltrates, and fibrosis in HFD animals. Exogenous administration of recombinant human (rh) HGF via the tail vein for 14 days markedly decreased ALT and AST to levels lower than those in the control group. Compared with the levels in HFD mice, c-Met, p-c-Met, JAK2, p-JAK2, and p-STAT3 levels were increased in mice that were administered HGF (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, silencing of HGF or blocking of its receptor c-Met affected JAK2 and STAT3 protein phosphorylation.Excess HGF highly probable improved NASH  function. Combined with its ligand, c-Met, HGF may promote the phosphorylation of JAK2-STAT3 and inhibit inflammation in NASH.

Other cytokines and signaling molecules also participate in the early part of the process. Regeneration employs effective redundancy schemes to compensate for the missing signals. Elimination of any single extracellular signaling pathway only delays but does not abolish the process. Our present study, however, shows that combined systemic elimination of MET and EGFR signaling (MET knockout + EGFR-inhibited mice) abolishes  regeneration, prevents restoration of  mass, and leads to  decompensation. MET knockout or simply EGFR-inhibited mice had distinct and signaling-specific alterations in Ser/Thr phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin, AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2, phosphatase and tensin homolog, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase α, etc. In the combined MET and EGFR signaling elimination of MET knockout + EGFR-inhibited mice, however, alterations dependent on either MET or EGFR combined to create shutdown of many programs vital to hepatocytes. These included decrease in expression of enzymes related to  acid metabolism, urea cycle, cell replication, and mitochondrial functions and increase in expression of glycolysis enzymes. There was, however, increased expression of genes of plasma proteins. Hepatocyte average volume decreased to 35% of control, with a proportional decrease in the dimensions of the hepatic lobules. Mice died at 15-18 days after hepatectomy with ascites, increased plasma ammonia, and very small livers.MET and EGFR separately control many nonoverlapping signaling endpoints, allowing for compensation when only one of the signals is blocked, though the combined elimination of the signals is not tolerated; the results provide critical new information on interactive MET and EGFR signaling and the contribution of their combined absence to regeneration arrest and  decompensation.

The prevailing view is that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis or cirrhosis are required for HCC in obesity. Here, we report that NASH and fibrosis and HCC in obesity can be dissociated. We show that the oxidative hepatic environment in obesity inactivates the STAT-1 and STAT-3 phosphatase T cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) and increases STAT-1 and STAT-3 signaling. TCPTP deletion in hepatocytes promoted T cell recruitment and ensuing NASH and fibrosis as well as HCC in obese C57BL/6 mice that normally do not develop NASH and fibrosis or HCC. Attenuating the enhanced STAT-1 signaling prevented T cell recruitment and NASH and fibrosis but did not prevent HCC. By contrast, correcting STAT-3 signaling prevented HCC without affecting NASH and fibrosis. TCPTP-deletion in hepatocytes also markedly accelerated HCC in mice treated with a chemical carcinogen that promotes HCC without NASH and fibrosis. Our studies reveal how obesity-associated hepatic oxidative stress can independently contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH, fibrosis, and HCC.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It responds to peripheral factors, such as insulin and leptin, that convey to the brain the degree of adiposity and the metabolic status of the organism. The development of leptin and insulin resistance in hypothalamic neurons appears to have a key role in the exacerbation of diet-induced obesity. In rodents, this has been attributed partly to the increased expression of the  phosphatases Protein  Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP), which attenuate leptin and insulin signaling. Deficiencies in PTP1B and TCPTP in the brain, or specific neurons, promote insulin and leptin signaling and prevent diet-induced obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and  disease. Although targeting phosphatases and hypothalamic circuits remains challenging, recent advances indicate that such hurdles might be overcome. Here, we focus on the roles of PTP1B and TCPTP in insulin and leptin signaling and explore their potential as therapeutic targets.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We used baseline serum samples from 75 subjects with incident HCC and 134 age- and gender-matched cancer-free subjects. Serum metabolic profiles associated with HCC incidence were investigated via metabolomics analysis. Compared with the control group, the HCC group showed significantly higher serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase.

NAFLD can progress from simple hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the mechanisms predisposing to this progression remain undefined. Notably, hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction is a common finding in patients with NASH. Due to a lack of appropriate experimental animal models, it has not been evaluated whether this mitochondrial dysfunction plays a causative role for the development of NASH.To determine the effect of a well-defined mitochondrial dysfunction on  physiology at baseline and during dietary challenge, C57BL/6J-mt(FVB/N) mice were employed. This conplastic inbred strain has been previously reported to exhibit decreased mitochondrial respiration likely linked to a non-synonymous gene variation (nt7778 G/T) of the mitochondrial ATP synthase protein 8 (mt-ATP8).At baseline conditions, C57BL/6J-mt(FVB/N) mice displayed hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by decreased ATP production and increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, genes affecting lipid metabolism were differentially expressed, hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels were changed in these animals, and various acyl-carnitines were altered, pointing towards an impaired mitochondrial carnitine shuttle. However, over a period of twelve months, no spontaneous hepatic steatosis or inflammation was observed. On the other hand, upon dietary challenge with either a methionine and choline deficient diet or a western-style diet, C57BL/6J-mt(FVB/N) mice developed aggravated steatohepatitis as characterized by lipid accumulation, ballooning of hepatocytes and infiltration of immune cells.We observed distinct metabolic alterations in mice with a mitochondrial polymorphism associated hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction.

Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that among 24 PFAAs, the level of plasma-branched chain amino acids (pBCAAs) was significantly associated with the CP score, especially the sAlb score, in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (CHC), NAFLD/NASH and PBC. The correlation coefficient values between sAlb and pBCAAs-to- ratio (BTR) in these patients were 0.53, 0.53 and 0.79, respectively. Interestingly, although the pBCAAs in NAFLD/NASH patients varied even when the sAlb was within the normal range, the pBCAAs tended to be low when the sAlb was below the normal range.Although a decrease in the level of pBCAAs was observed during the progression regardless of the CLD etiology, the level of total pBCAAs was independently associated with the sAlb level in the PFAAs of CHC, PBC and NAFLD/NASH. The correlation between sAlb and BTR showed the highest value in PBC patients among the patients with CLDs. A decrease in pBCAAs often occurred in NASH even when the sAlb level was kept in the normal range.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27973445>Roles of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α in Bitter Melon Seed Oil-Corrected Lipid Disorders and Conversion of α-Eleostearic Acid into Rumenic Acid in C57BL/6J Mice.</a></h1><p>We previously reported that bitter melon seed oil (BMSO) was an effective anti-steatosis and antiobesity agent. Since the major  acid α-eleostearic acid (α-ESA) in BMSO is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activator, the objective was to investigate the role of PPARα in BMSO-modulated lipid disorders and α-ESA metabolism. C57BL/6J wild (WD) and PPARα knockout (KO) mice were fed a high-fat diet containing BMSO (15% soybean oil + 15% BMSO, HB) or not (30% soybean oil, HS) for 5 weeks. The HB diet significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride concentrations and increased acyl-CoA oxidase activity in WD, but not in KO mice. However, regardless of genotype, body fat percentage was lowered along with upregulated protein levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and  hydroxylase, as well as signaling pathway of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and AMP-activated protein kinase in the white adipose tissue of HB-treated groups compared to HS cohorts. In WD-HB and KO-HB groups, white adipose tissue had autophagy, apoptosis, inflammation, and browning characteristics. Without PPARα, in vivo reduction of α-ESA into rumenic acid was slightly but significantly lowered, along with remarkable reduction of hepatic retinol saturase () expression. We concluded that BMSO-mediated anti-steatosis depended on PPARα, whereas the anti-adiposity effect was PPARα-independent. In addition, PPARα-dependent enzymes may participate in α-ESA conversion, but only have a minor role.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26714846>Neuregulin improves response to glucose tolerance test in control and diabetic rats.</a></h1><p>Neuregulin (NRG) is an EGF-related growth factor that binds to the  kinase receptors ErbB3 and ErbB4, thus inducing tissue development and muscle glucose utilization during contraction. Here, we analyzed whether NRG has systemic effects regulating glycemia in control and type 2 diabetic rats. To this end, recombinant NRG (rNRG) was injected into Zucker diabetic  (ZDF) rats and their respective lean littermates 15 min before a glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed. rNRG enhanced glucose tolerance without promoting the activation of the insulin receptor (IR) or insulin receptor substrates (IRS) in muscle and . However, in control rats, rNRG induced the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in  but not in muscle. In , rNRG increased ErbB3  phosphorylation and its binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), thus indicating that rNRG activates the ErbB3/PI3K/PKB signaling pathway. rNRG increased glycogen content in  but not in muscle. rNRG also increased the content of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), an activator of hepatic glycolysis, and lactate in  but not in muscle. Increases in lactate were abrogated by wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, in incubated hepatocytes. The  of ZDF rats showed a reduced content of ErbB3 receptors, entailing a minor stimulation of the rNRG-induced PKB/GSK-3 cascade and resulting in unaltered hepatic glycogen content. Nonetheless, rNRG increased hepatic Fru-2,6-P2 and augmented lactate both in  and in plasma of diabetic rats. As a whole, rNRG improved response to the GTT in both control and diabetic rats by enhancing hepatic glucose utilization.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30219279>Therapeutic inhibition of spleen  kinase in inflammatory macrophages using PLGA nanoparticles for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the leading cause of cirrhosis worldwide and the most rapidly growing indication for  transplantation. Macrophages are the important cellular component in the inflammatory milieu in NASH. Inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators produced by macrophages causes significant tissue injury in many inflammatory diseases. Therefore, inhibition of the inflammatory macrophages would be a promising approach to attenuate NASH. In this study, we studied the implication of SYK pathway in NASH, and investigated PLGA nanoparticles-based delivery of SYK pathway inhibitor as an effective and promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of NASH. We found positive correlation between SYK expression with the pathogenesis of NASH and alcoholic hepatitis in patients. Importantly, SYK expression was significantly induced in M1-differentiated inflammatory macrophages. To inhibit SYK pathway specifically, we used a small-molecule inhibitor R406 that blocks Fc-receptor signaling pathway and reduces immune complex-mediated inflammation. R406 dose-dependently inhibited nitric-oxide release and M1-specific markers in M1-differentiated macrophages. Thereafter, we synthesized PLGA nanoparticles to deliver R406 to increase the drug pharmacokinetics for the efficient treatment of NASH. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of R406-PLGA in-vitro in differentiated macrophages, and in-vivo in Methionine-Choline-deficient (MCD)-diet induced NASH mouse model. R406-PLGA inhibited M1-specific differentiation markers in RAW and bone-marrow-derived macrophages. In-vivo, R406 and more strongly R406-PLGA ameliorated fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis in mice. R406 and more significantly R406-PLGA reduced ALT, AST, cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels. These results suggest that delivery of SYK inhibitor using PLGA nanoparticles can be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Based on in-depth reviews of serological diagnosis of HCC, in addition to AFP, there are other biomarkers: Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive AFP (AFP-L3), des- carboxyprothrombin (DCP),  kinase with Ig and eprdermal growth factor (EGF) homology domains 2 (TIE2)-espressing monocytes (TEMs), glypican-3 (GPC3), Golgi protein 73 (GP73), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) have been proposed as biomarkers for the early detection of HCC. The diagnosis of HCC is primarily based on noninvasive standard imaging methods, such as ultrasound (US), dynamic multiphasic multidetector-row CT (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some experts advocate gadolinium diethyl-enetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) MRI and contrast-enhanced US as the promising imaging madalities of choice. With regard to recent advancements in tissue markers, many cuting-edge technologies using genome-wide DNA microarrays, qRT-PCR, and proteomic and inmunostaining studies have been implemented in an attempt to identify markers for early diagnosis of HCC. Only less than half of HCC patients at initial diagnosis are at an early stage treatable with curative options: local ablation, surgical resection, or  transplant. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is considered the standard of care with palliation for intermediate stage HCC. Recent innovative procedures using drug-eluting-beads and radioembolization using Yttrium-90 may exhibit beneficial effects in HCC treatment. During the past few years, several molecular targeted agents have been evaluated in clinical trials in advanced HCC. Sorafenib is currently the only approved systemic treatment for HCC. It has been approved for the therapy of asymptomatic HCC patients with well-preserved  function who are not candidates for potentially curative treatments, such as surgical resection or  transplantation. In the USA, Europe and particularly Japan, hepatitis C virus (HCV) related HCC accounts for most  cancer, as compared with Asia-Pacific regions, where hepatitis B virus (HBV) may play a more important role in HCC development. HBV vaccination, while a vaccine is not yet available against HCV, has been recognized as a best primary prevention method for HBV-related HCC, although in patients already infected with HBV or HCV, secondary prevention with antiviral therapy is still a reasonable strategy. In addition to HBV and HCV, attention should be paid to other relevant HCC risk factors, including nonalcoholic  disease due to obesity and diabetes, heavy alcohol consumption, and prolonged aflatoxin exposure. Interestingly, coffee and vitamin K2 have been proven to provide protective effects against HCC. Regarding tertiary prevention of HCC recurrence after surgical resection, addition of antiviral treatment has proven to be a rational strategy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31258478>Therapeutic Mechanisms of Herbal Medicines Against Insulin Resistance: A Review.</a></h1><p>Insulin resistance is a condition in which insulin sensitivity is reduced and the insulin signaling pathway is impaired. Although often expressed as an increase in insulin concentration, the disease is characterized by a decrease in insulin action. This increased workload of the pancreas and the consequent decompensation are not only the main mechanisms for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but also exacerbate the damage of metabolic diseases, including obesity, nonalcoholic  disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, metabolic syndrome, and others. Many clinical trials have suggested the potential role of herbs in the treatment of insulin resistance, although most of the clinical trials included in this review have certain flaws and bias risks in their methodological design, including the generation of randomization, the concealment of allocation, blinding, and inadequate reporting of sample size estimates. These studies involve not only the single-flavored herbs, but also herbal formulas, extracts, and active ingredients. Numerous of  and  studies have pointed out that the role of herbal medicine in improving insulin resistance is related to interventions in various aspects of the insulin signaling pathway. The targets involved in these studies include insulin receptor substrate, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, glucose transporter, AMP-activated protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3, mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, nuclear factor-kappaB, protein  phosphatase 1B, nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Improved insulin sensitivity upon treatment with herbal medicine provides considerable prospects for treating insulin resistance.

Our recent work indicated that EGFR can also regulate lipid metabolism during  regeneration after partial hepatectomy. Based on these findings, we investigated the role of EGFR in a mouse model of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) using a pharmacological inhibition strategy. C57BL6/J mice were fed a chow diet or a fast-food diet (FFD) with or without EGFR inhibitor (canertinib) for 2 months. EGFR inhibition completely prevented development of steatosis and  injury in this model. In order to study if EGFR inhibition can reverse NAFLD progression, mice were fed the FFD for 5 months, with or without canertinib treatment for the last 5 weeks of the study. EGFR inhibition remarkably decreased steatosis,  injury, and fibrosis and improved glucose tolerance. Microarray analysis revealed that ~40% of genes altered by the FFD were differentially expressed after EGFR inhibition and, thus, are potentially regulated by EGFR. Several genes and enzymes related to lipid metabolism (particularly  acid synthesis and lipolysis), which were disrupted by the FFD, were found to be modulated by EGFR. Several crucial transcription factors that play a central role in regulating these lipid metabolism genes during NAFLD, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha, were also found to be modulated by EGFR. In fact, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that PPARγ binding to several crucial lipid metabolism genes ( acid synthase, stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1, and perilipin 2) was drastically reduced by EGFR inhibition. Further upstream, EGFR inhibition suppressed AKT signaling, which is known to control these transcription factors, including PPARγ and SREBF1, in NAFLD models. Lastly, the effect of EGFR in FFD-induced  phenotype was not shared by receptor  kinase MET, investigated using MET knockout mice. Conclusion: Our study revealed a role of EGFR in NAFLD and the potential of EGFR inhibition as a treatment strategy for NAFLD.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26596542>MERTK rs4374383 polymorphism affects the severity of fibrosis in non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h1><p>Homozygosity for a common non-coding rs4374383 G>A polymorphism in MERTK (myeloid-epithelial-reproductive  kinase) has been associated with the protection against fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis C. The main study objective was to assess whether MERTK AA genotype influences  fibrosis, and secondarily MERTK expression in patients with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). We also investigated whether MERTK is expressed in human hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and in murine models of fibrogenesis.We considered 533 consecutive patients who underwent  biopsy for suspected non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) without severe obesity from two Italian cohorts. As controls, we evaluated 158 patients with normal  enzymes and without metabolic disturbances. MERTK rs4374383 genotype was assessed by 5'-nuclease assays. MERTK expression was analysed in mouse models of fibrosis, and the effect of the MERTK ligand GAS6 were investigated in human HSC.Clinically significant fibrosis (stage F2-F4) was observed in 19% of patients with MERTK AA compared to 30% in those with MERTK GG/GA (OR 0.43, CI 0.21-0.88, p=0.02; adjusted for centre, and genetic, clinical-metabolic and histological variables). The protective rs4374383 AA genotype was associated with lower MERTK hepatic expression. MERTK was overexpressed in the  of NAFLD patients with F2-F4 fibrosis and in in vivo models of fibrogenesis. Furthermore, exposure of cultured human HSC to the MERTK ligand GAS6, increased cell migration and induced procollagen expression. These effects were counteracted by inhibition of MERTK activity, which also resulted in apoptotic death of HSC.The rs4374383 AA genotype, associated with lower intrahepatic expression of MERTK, is protective against F2-F4 fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. The mechanism may involve modulation of HSC activation.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the . Published by Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that in , NADPH oxidase activation is key in TLR4 recruitment into lipid rafts, which in turn up-regulates NF-κB translocation to the nucleus and subsequent DNA binding, leading to NASH progression. Results from confocal microscopy showed that  from murine and human NASH had NADPH oxidase activation, which led to the formation of highly reactive peroxynitrite, as shown by 3-nitrotyrosine formation in diseased . Expression and recruitment of TLR4 into the lipid rafts were significantly greater in rodent and human NASH. The described phenomenon was NADPH oxidase, p47phox, and peroxynitrite dependent, as  from p47phox-deficient mice and from mice treated with a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst [iron(III) tetrakis(p-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin] or a peroxynitrite scavenger (phenylboronic acid) had markedly less Tlr4 recruitment into lipid rafts. Mechanistically, peroxynitrite-induced TLR4 recruitment was linked to increased IL-1β, sinusoidal injury, and Kupffer cell activation while blocking peroxynitrite-attenuated NASH symptoms. The results strongly suggest that NADPH oxidase-mediated peroxynitrite drove TLR4 recruitment into hepatic lipid rafts and inflammation, whereas the in vivo use of the peroxynitrite scavenger phenylboronic acid, a novel synthetic molecule having high reactivity with peroxynitrite, attenuates inflammatory pathogenesis in NASH.Copyright © 2015 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Binge alcohol use, similar to chronic alcohol consumption, induces numerous deregulated signaling events that drive  damage, steatosis, and inflammation. In this article, we evaluated the role of spleen  kinase (SYK), which modulates numerous signaling events previously identified linked in the development alcohol-induced  pathology.A 3-day alcohol binge was administered to C57BL/6 female mice, and features of alcoholic  disease were assessed. Some mice were treated daily with intraperitoneal injections of a SYK inhibitor (R406; 5 to 10 mg/kg body weight) or drug vehicle control.  and serum samples were collected and were assessed by Western blotting, biochemical, ELISA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and histopathological analysis.We found that binge drinking induced significant SYK activation (SYK(Y525/526) ) with no change in total SYK expression in the . Functional inhibition of SYK activation using a potent SYK inhibitor, R406, was associated with a significant decrease in alcohol-induced hepatic inflammation as demonstrated by decreased phospho-nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) p65, NF-κB nuclear binding, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA in the . Compared to vehicle controls, SYK inhibitor treatment decreased alcohol binge-induced hepatocyte injury indicated by histology and serum alanine aminotransferase. Strikingly, SYK inhibitor treatment also resulted in a significant reduction in alcohol-induced  steatosis.Our novel observations demonstrate the role of SYK, activation in the pathomechanism of binge drinking-induced  disease highlighting SYK a potential multifaceted therapeutic target.Copyright © 2016 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29162488>Transcription analysis of the interaction between chicken thymus and recombinant avian leukosis virus isolate FJ15HT0.</a></h1><p>Avian leukosis virus (ALV) induces multiple avian tumors, growth decrease and immune suppression. Previously, a novel natural recombinant ALV isolate FJ15HT0 was proven to be associated with significant body weight decrease, immune suppression and lymphocytoma in infected SPF chickens. In order to uncover the interaction between virus and host, we compared differences in the transcriptomes of the thymuses from the mock chickens and simulated congenitally infected chickens at 5days (d), 13d and 21d of age by RNA-seq analysis of the thymuses.

Interestingly, fold change of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor α (CNTFRα) in infected donor collected from 2d to 21d showed a significant positive correlation with the corresponding expression of the viral gp85 gene in thymuses (r=0.656, P<0.01) and in livers (r=0.525, P<0.05).

These toxic  acids can induce  cell death and our recent results demonstrated that the biliary epithelium may be susceptible to lipotoxicity. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms of cholangiocyte lipoapoptosis in cell culture and in an animal model of NASH. Treatment of cholangiocytes with palmitate (PA) showed increased caspase 3/7 activity and increased levels of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and cleaved caspase 3, demonstrating cholangiocyte lipoapoptosis. Interestingly, treatment with PA significantly increased the levels of microRNA miR-34a, a pro-apoptotic microRNA known to be elevated in NASH. PA induction of miR-34a was abolished in cholangiocytes transduced with forkhead family of transcription factor class O (FoxO)3 shRNA, demonstrating that FoxO3 activation is upstream of miR-34a and suggesting that FoxO3 is a novel transcriptional regulator of miR-34a. Further, anti-miR-34a protected cholangiocytes from PA-induced lipoapoptosis. Direct and indirect targets of miR-34a, such as SIRT1, receptor  kinase (MET), Kruppel-like factor 4, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)1, and FGFR4, were all decreased in PA-treated cholangiocytes. SIRT1 and MET were partially rescued by a miR-34a antagonist. Cholangiocyte apoptosis and miR-34a were dramatically increased in the  of mice with early histologic features of NASH.

Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacological strategy is available to treat this condition in the clinic. In this study, we applied extensive gain- and loss-of-function approaches to identify the key immune factor leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4 (LILRB4) as a negative regulator of NAFLD. The hepatocyte-specific knockout of LILRB4 (LILRB4-HKO) exacerbated high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance, glucose metabolic imbalance, hepatic lipid accumulation, and systematic inflammation in mice, whereas LILRB4 overexpression in hepatocytes showed a completely opposite phenotype relative to that of LILRB4-HKO mice when compared with their corresponding controls. Further investigations of molecular mechanisms demonstrated that LILRB4 recruits SHP1 to inhibit TRAF6 ubiquitination and subsequent inactivation of nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. From a therapeutic perspective, the overexpression of LILRB4 in a genetic model of NAFLD, ob/ob mice, largely reversed the inherent hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and metabolic disorder.Targeting hepatic LILRB4 to improve its expression or activation represents a promising strategy for the treatment of NAFLD as well as related  and metabolic diseases.

Increasing evidence indicates that betacyanins possess free-radical-scavenging and antioxidant activities, suggesting their beneficial effects on metabolic disorders. The main objective of this study was to isolate and identify the betaycanins from Hylocereus undatus (white-fleshed pitaya) peel and evaluate their ability to ameliorate obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis in high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. The purified pitaya peel betacyanins (PPBNs) were identified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), and the male C57BL/6 mice were fed a low-fat diet, HFD, or HFD supplemented with PPBNs for 14 weeks. Our results showed that the white-fleshed pitaya peel contains 14 kinds of betacyanins and dietary PPBNs reduced HFD-induced body weight gain and ameliorated adipose tissue hypertrophy, hepatosteatosis, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. Moreover, the hepatic gene expression analysis indicated that PPBN supplementation increased the expression levels of lipid-metabolism-related genes (AdipoR2, Cpt1a, Cpt1b, Acox1, PPARγ, Insig1, and Insig2) and FGF21-related genes (β-Klotho and FGFR1/2) but decreased the expression level of Fads2, Fas, and FGF21, suggesting that the protective effect of PPBNs might be associated with the induced  acid oxidation, decreased  acid biosynthesis, and alleviated FGF21 resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26206323>A novel NAD(P)H-dependent carbonyl reductase specifically expressed in the thyroidectomized chicken : catalytic properties and crystal structure.</a></h1><p>A gene encoding a functionally unknown protein that is specifically expressed in the thyroidectomized chicken  and has a predicted amino acid sequence similar to that of NAD(P)H-dependent carbonyl reductase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli; its product was purified and characterized. The expressed enzyme was an NAD(P)H-dependent broad substrate specificity carbonyl reductase and was inhibited by arachidonic acid at 1.5 μm. Enzymological characterization indicated that the enzyme could be classified as a cytosolic-type carbonyl reductase. The enzyme's 3D structure was determined using the molecular replacement method at 1.98 Å resolution in the presence of NADPH and ethylene glycol. The asymmetric unit consisted of two subunits, and a noncrystallographic twofold axis generated the functional dimer. The structures of the subunits, A and B, differed from each other. In subunit A, the active site contained an ethylene glycol molecule absent in subunit B. Consequently, Tyr172 in subunit A rotated by 103.7° in comparison with subunit B, which leads to active site closure in subunit A. In Y172A mutant, the Km value for 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (model substrate) was 12.5 times higher than that for the wild-type enzyme, indicating that Tyr172 plays a key role in substrate binding in this carbonyl reductase. Because the Tyr172-containing active site lid structure (Ile164-Gln174) is not conserved in all known carbonyl reductases, our results provide new insights into substrate binding of carbonyl reductase.

Studies conducted using systemic and tissue-specific gene-knockout mice of IR, Irs1, and Irs2 have revealed the physiological roles of these molecules in each tissue and interactions among multiple tissues. In obesity and type 2 diabetes, selective downregulation of Irs2 and its downstream actions to cause reduced insulin actions was associated with increased insulin actions through Irs1 in variety tissues. Thus, we propose the novel concept of "organ- and pathway-specific imbalanced insulin action" in obesity and type 2 diabetes, which includes and extends "selective insulin resistance."

Most HCCs develop in the context of  fibrosis and cirrhosis caused by chronic inflammation. Short-term fasting approaches enhance the activity of chemotherapy in preclinical cancer models, other than HCC. Multi- kinase inhibitor Sorafenib is the mainstay of treatment in HCC. However, its benefit is frequently short-lived. Whether fasting can alleviate  fibrosis and whether combining fasting with Sorafenib is beneficial remains unknown. A 24 hr fasting (2% serum, 0.1% glucose)-induced changes on human hepatic stellate cells (HSC) LX-2 proliferation/viability/cell cycle were assessed by MTT and flow cytometry. Expression of lypolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation markers (vimentin, αSMA) was evaluated by qPCR and immunoblotting.  fibrosis and inflammation were evaluated in a mouse model of steatohepatitis exposed to cycles of fasting, by histological and biochemical analyses. A 24 hr fasting-induced changes were also analyzed on the proliferation/viability/glucose uptake of human HCC cells exposed to Sorafenib. An expression panel of genes involved in survival, inflammation, and metabolism was examined by qPCR in HCC cells exposed to fasting and/or Sorafenib. Fasting decreased the proliferation and the activation of HSC. Repeated cycles of short term starvation were safe in mice but did not improve fibrosis. Fasting synergized with Sorafenib in hampering HCC cell growth and glucose uptake. Finally, fasting normalized the expression levels of genes which are commonly altered by Sorafenib in HCC cells. Fasting or fasting-mimicking diet diets should be evaluated in preclinical studies as a mean to potentiate the activity of Sorafenib in clinical use.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26969444>A urinary metabonomics analysis of long-term effect of acetochlor exposure on rats by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>The study was to assess the long-term toxic effects of acetochlor on rats.

In addition, it may interfere with the  acid synthesis, the pyrimidine degradation and pantothenate biosynthesis. The level of 2-ethyl-6-methyl-N-methyl-2-chloro-acetanilide is detected in all treated groups which is not found in the control groups, indicating which can be used as an early, sensitive marker of acetochlor exposure in rat. This study illustrates the important utility of metabonomics approaches to understand the toxicity of long-term exposure of acetochlor.Copyright © 2015.

Obesity, a known risk factor for  fibrosis is associated with reduced levels of adiponectin, a protein that inhibits  fibrosis in vivo and limits HSC proliferation and migration in vitro. Adiponectin-mediated activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) inhibits HSC proliferation, but the mechanism by which it limits HSC migration to sites of injury is unknown. Here we sought to elucidate how adiponectin regulates HSC motility. Primary rat HSCs were isolated and treated with adiponectin in migration assays. The in vivo actions of adiponectin were examined by treating mice with carbon tetrachloride for 12 weeks and then injecting them with adiponectin. Cell and tissue samples were collected and analyzed for gene expression, signaling, and histology. Serum from patients with  fibrosis was examined for adiponectin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) protein. Adiponectin administration into mice increased TIMP-1 gene and protein expression. In cultured HSCs, adiponectin promoted TIMP-1 expression and through binding of TIMP-1 to the CD63/β1-integrin complex reduced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase to limit HSC migration. In mice with  fibrosis, adiponectin had similar effects and limited focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation. Finally, in patients with advanced fibrosis, there was a positive correlation between serum adiponectin and TIMP-1 levels. In sum, these data show that adiponectin stimulates TIMP-1 secretion by HSCs to retard their migration and contributes to the anti-fibrotic effects of adiponectin.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30976490>Small molecules for fat combustion: targeting obesity.</a></h1><p>Obesity is increasing in an alarming rate worldwide, which causes higher risks of some diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Current therapeutic approaches, either pancreatic lipase inhibitors or appetite suppressors, are generally of limited effectiveness. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige cells dissipate  acids as heat to maintain body temperature, termed non-shivering thermogenesis; the activity and mass of BAT and beige cells are negatively correlated with overweight and obesity. The existence of BAT and beige cells in human adults provides an effective weight reduction therapy, a process likely to be amenable to pharmacological intervention. Herein, we combed through the physiology of thermogenesis and the role of BAT and beige cells in combating with obesity. We summarized the thermogenic regulators identified in the past decades, targeting G protein-coupled receptors, transient receptor potential channels, nuclear receptors and miscellaneous pathways. Advances in clinical trials were also presented. The main purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge from the biological importance of thermogenesis in energy homeostasis to the representative thermogenic regulators for treating obesity. Thermogenic regulators might have a large potential for further investigations to be developed as lead compounds in fighting obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29521221>Non-invasive Qualitative Urinary Metabolomic Profiling Discriminates Gut Microbiota Derived Metabolites in the Moderate and Chronic Alcoholic Cohorts.</a></h1><p>Excessive alcohol consumption damages the intestine and  cells directly as well as through unbalancing the gut microbiota.The current study was undertaken to correlate the alcohol consumption and change in urinary metabolites profile linked with gut microbiota.Non-alcoholic (control) healthy (n=22) and moderate alcoholic (n=26) males with an average age of 39.3±1.83 years subjected to alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) were considered for study. First pass urine and blood samples were collected in the morning. function test showed the increased levels of γGT, AST and ALT to 40.3 ± 2.3, 53.3 ± 0.7, and 38.9 ± 0.5 U/L, respectively. Urine samples were processed and subjected to HPLC-Q-TOFMS analysis in positive and negative ion polarity modes. Mass data were processed to align and filter out insignificant entities and subjected to One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple testing corrections analysis. The analysis provided list of 211gut microbes specific metabolites with p>0.05 and fold change >1.5. All metabolites were identified using standards and referring to METALIN library of standard metabolites. Further analyses showed that alcohol intake disturbed more than ten metabolic pathways. Tryptophan, , branched chain amino acids and short-chain  acids metabolism were the significantly disturbed pathways in alcoholics.Correlation of various metabolites with gut microbiota showed that chronic and moderate dose intake of alcohol decreased the level of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus Ruminococcus and Faecalibacterium spp. and increased the levels of Proteobacteria, Alcaligenes and Clostridium.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25347994>M1 polarization bias and subsequent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis progression is attenuated by nitric oxide donor DETA NONOate via inhibition of CYP2E1-induced oxidative stress in obese mice.</a></h1><p>Activation of M1 macrophages in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is produced by several external or endogenous factors: inflammatory stimuli, oxidative stress, and cytokines are known. However, any direct role of oxidative stress in causing M1 polarization in NASH has been unclear. We hypothesized that CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress causes M1 polarization in experimental NASH, and that nitric oxide (NO) donor administration inhibits CYP2E1-mediated inflammation with concomitant attenuation of M1 polarization. Because CYP2E1 takes center stage in these studies, we used a toxin model of NASH that uses a ligand and a substrate of CYP2E1 for inducing NASH. Subsequently, we used a methionine and choline-deficient diet-induced rodent NASH model where the role of CYP2E1 in disease progression has been shown. Our results show that CYP2E1 causes M1 polarization bias, which includes a significant increase in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-12 in both models of NASH, whereas CYP2E1-null mice or diallyl sulfide administration prevented it. Administration of gadolinium chloride (GdCl3), a macrophage toxin, attenuated both the initial M1 response and the subsequent M2 response, showing that the observed increase in cytokine levels is primarily from macrophages. Based on the evidence of an adaptive NO increase, the NO donor administration in vivo that mechanistically inhibited CYP2E1 catalyzed the oxidative stress during the entire study in NASH-abrogated M1 polarization and NASH progression. The results obtained show the association of CYP2E1 in M1 polarization, and that inhibition of CYP2E1 catalyzed oxidative stress by an NO donor (DETA NONOate [(Z)-1-[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate]) can be a promising therapeutic strategy in NASH.Copyright © 2014 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30206377>Targeting a phospho-STAT3-miRNAs pathway improves vesicular hepatic steatosis in an in vitro and in vivo model.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a leading cause of chronic  disease. Although genetic predisposition and epigenetic factors contribute to the development of NAFLD, our understanding of the molecular mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of the disease is still emerging. Here we investigated a possible role of a microRNAs-STAT3 pathway in the induction of hepatic steatosis. Differentiated HepaRG cells treated with the  acid sodium oleate ( dHepaRG) recapitulated features of  vesicular steatosis and activated a cell-autonomous inflammatory response, inducing STAT3--phosphorylation. With a genome-wide approach (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing), many phospho-STAT3 binding sites were identified in  dHepaRG cells and several STAT3 and/or NAFLD-regulated microRNAs showed increased expression levels, including miR-21. Innovative CARS (Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering) microscopy revealed that chemical inhibition of STAT3 activity decreased lipid accumulation and deregulated STAT3-responsive microRNAs, including miR-21, in lipid overloaded dHepaRG cells. We were able to show in vivo that reducing phospho-STAT3-miR-21 levels in C57/BL6 mice , by long-term treatment with metformin, protected mice from aging-dependent hepatic vesicular steatosis.

The MSP/Ron receptor axis has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties in a number of mouse models, due at least in part, to its ability to limit pro-inflammatory responses in tissue-resident macrophages and hepatocytes. In this study, we established the role of the Ron receptor in steatohepatitis-induced hepatic fibrosis using Ron ligand domain knockout mice on an apolipoprotein E knockout background (DKO). After 18 weeks of high-fat high-cholesterol feeding, loss of Ron activation resulted in exacerbated NASH-associated steatosis which is precedent to hepatocellular injury, inflammation and fibrosis. H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics identified significant changes in serum metabolites that can modulate the intrahepatic lipid pool in hepatic steatosis. Serum from DKO mice had higher concentrations of lipids, VLDL/LDL and pyruvate, whereas glycine levels were reduced. Parallel to the aggravated steatohepatitis, increased accumulation of collagen, inflammatory immune cells and collagen producing-myofibroblasts were seen in the livers of DKO mice. Gene expression profiling revealed that DKO mice exhibited elevated expression of genes encoding Ron receptor ligand MSP, collagens, ECM remodeling proteins and pro-fibrogenic cytokines in the .

The association between rs58542926-T and apoB-100 was confirmed in an independent sample of 2,196 Finnish individuals from the FINRISK study (β = -0.029,  = 0.029). Secondary analyses demonstrated an rs58542926-T dose-dependent decrease in particle concentration, cholesterol, and triglyceride (TG) content for VLDL and LDL particles ( < 0.001 for all). No significant associations between rs58542926-T and HDL measures were observed.  SNP rs58542926-T and  levels were associated with increased incident T2D risk in both METSIM and FINRISK.

Metabolomic methods measure the metabolome (metabolite profile) which can be used to examine disease progression and treatment responses. Here, our aim was to review metabolomics studies examining effects of alcohol use in humans.We performed a literature search using PubMed and Web of Science for reports on changes in the human metabolite profile associated with alcohol use; we found a total of 23 articles published before end of 2018.Most studies had investigated plasma, serum or urine samples; only four studies had examined other sample types (, faeces and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid). Levels of 51 metabolites were altered in two or more of the reviewed studies. Alcohol use was associated with changes in the levels of lipids and amino acids. In general, levels of  acids, phosphatidylcholine diacyls and steroid metabolites tended to increase, whereas those of phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyls and hydroxysphingomyelins declined. Common alterations in circulatory levels of amino acids included decreased levels of glutamine, and increased levels of  and alanine.More studies, especially with a longitudinal study design, or using more varied sample materials (e.g. organs or saliva), are needed to clarify alcohol-induced diseases and alterations at a target organ level. Hopefully, this will lead to the discovery of new treatments, improved recognition of individuals at high risk and identification of those subjects who would benefit most from certain treatments.© The Author(s) 2019.

In the present study, we aimed to analyse the effects of polyphenolic extracts from five types of Arctic berries in a model of diet-induced obesity.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet and orally treated with extracts of bog blueberry (BBE), cloudberry (CLE), crowberry (CRE), alpine bearberry (ABE), lingonberry (LGE) or vehicle (HFHS) for 8 weeks. An additional group of standard-chow-fed, vehicle-treated mice was included as a reference control for diet-induced obesity. OGTTs and insulin tolerance tests were conducted, and both plasma insulin and C-peptide were assessed throughout the OGTT. Quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and ELISAs were used to assess enterohepatic immunometabolic features. Faecal DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA gene-based analysis was used to profile the gut microbiota.Treatment with CLE, ABE and LGE, but not with BBE or CRE, prevented both fasting hyperinsulinaemia (mean ± SEM [pmol/l]: chow 67.2 ± 12.3, HFHS 153.9 ± 19.3, BBE 114.4 ± 14.3, CLE 82.5 ± 13.0, CRE 152.3 ± 24.4, ABE 90.6 ± 18.0, LGE 95.4 ± 10.5) and postprandial hyperinsulinaemia (mean ± SEM AUC [pmol/l × min]: chow 14.3 ± 1.4, HFHS 31.4 ± 3.1, BBE 27.2 ± 4.0, CLE 17.7 ± 2.2, CRE 32.6 ± 6.3, ABE 22.7 ± 18.0, LGE 23.9 ± 2.5). None of the berry extracts affected C-peptide levels or body weight gain. Levels of hepatic serine phosphorylated Akt were 1.6-, 1.5- and 1.2-fold higher with CLE, ABE and LGE treatment, respectively, and hepatic carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM)-1  phosphorylation was 0.6-, 0.7- and 0.9-fold increased in these mice vs vehicle-treated, HFHS-fed mice. These changes were associated with reduced  triacylglycerol deposition, lower circulating endotoxins, alleviated hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and major gut microbial alterations (e.g. bloom of Akkermansia muciniphila, Turicibacter and Oscillibacter) in CLE-, ABE- and LGE-treated mice.Our findings reveal novel mechanisms by which polyphenolic extracts from ABE, LGE and especially CLE target the gut- axis to protect diet-induced obese mice against metabolic endotoxaemia, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, which importantly improves hepatic insulin clearance. These results support the potential benefits of these Arctic berries and their integration into health programmes to help attenuate obesity-related chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders.All raw sequences have been deposited in the public European Nucleotide Archive server under accession number PRJEB19783 ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB19783 ).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29351427>Role of PTP1B in POMC neurons during chronic high-fat diet: sex differences in regulation of  lipids and glucose tolerance.</a></h1><p>Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of leptin receptor signaling and may contribute to leptin resistance in diet-induced obesity. Although PTP1B inhibition has been suggested as a potential weight loss therapy, the role of specific neuronal PTP1B signaling in cardiovascular and metabolic regulation and the importance of sex differences in this regulation are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neuronal PTP1B deficiency in cardiometabolic regulation in male and female mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). When compared with control mice (PTP1B ), male and female mice deficient in POMC neuronal PTP1B (PTP1B /POMC-Cre) had attenuated body weight gain (males: -18%; females: -16%) and fat mass (males: -33%; female: -29%) in response to HFD. Glucose tolerance was improved by 40%, and  lipid accumulation was reduced by 40% in PTP1B/POMC-Cre males but not in females. When compared with control mice, deficiency of POMC neuronal PTP1B did not alter mean arterial pressure (MAP) in male or female mice (males: 112 ± 1 vs. 112 ± 1 mmHg in controls; females: 106 ± 3 vs. 109 ± 3 mmHg in controls). Deficiency of POMC neuronal PTP1B also did not alter MAP response to acute stress in males or females compared with control mice (males: Δ32 ± 0 vs. Δ29 ± 4 mmHg; females: Δ22 ± 2 vs. Δ27 ± 4 mmHg).

In 940 participants with strictly normal serum concentrations of free triiodothyronine (fT), free thyroxine (fT), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) followed up for 3 yr, we measured insulin sensitivity (by the insulin clamp technique) and 35 circulating metabolites. At baseline, across quartiles of increasing fT levels (or fT/fT ratio) most features of IR emerged [i.e., male sex, greater body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, heart rate, blood pressure,  index, free  acids, and triglycerides; reduced insulin-mediated glucose disposal; and β-cell glucose sensitivity). In multiadjusted analyses, fT was reciprocally related to insulin sensitivity and, in a subset of 303 subjects, directly related to endogenous glucose production. In multiple regression models adjusting for sex, age, BMI, and baseline value of insulin sensitivity, higher baseline fT levels were significant predictors of decreases in insulin sensitivity. Moreover, baseline fT predicted follow-up increases in glycemia independently of sex, age, BMI, insulin sensitivity, β-cell glucose sensitivity, and baseline glycemia. Serum  levels were higher with IR and were directly associated with fT; higher α-hydroxybutyrate levels signaled enhanced oxidative stress, thereby impairing  degradation. In 25 patients with morbid obesity, surgery-induced weight loss improved IR and consensually lowered fT levels. High-normal fT levels are associated with IR both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and predict deterioration of glucose tolerance. This association is supported by a metabolite pattern that points at increased oxidative stress as part of the IR syndrome.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25540128>In vitro treatment of HepG2 cells with saturated  acids reproduces mitochondrial dysfunction found in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Activity of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) is decreased in humans and mice with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Nitro-oxidative stress seems to be involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether  acids are implicated in the pathogenesis of this mitochondrial defect. In HepG2 cells, we analyzed the effect of saturated (palmitic and stearic acids) and monounsaturated (oleic acid)  acids on: OXPHOS activity; levels of protein expression of OXPHOS complexes and their subunits; gene expression and half-life of OXPHOS complexes; nitro-oxidative stress; and NADPH oxidase gene expression and activity. We also studied the effects of inhibiting or silencing NADPH oxidase on the palmitic-acid-induced nitro-oxidative stress and subsequent OXPHOS inhibition. Exposure of cultured HepG2 cells to saturated  acids resulted in a significant decrease in the OXPHOS activity. This effect was prevented in the presence of a mimic of manganese superoxide dismutase. Palmitic acid reduced the amount of both fully-assembled OXPHOS complexes and of complex subunits. This reduction was due mainly to an accelerated degradation of these subunits, which was associated with a 3- nitration of mitochondrial proteins. Pretreatment of cells with uric acid, an antiperoxynitrite agent, prevented protein degradation induced by palmitic acid. A reduced gene expression also contributed to decrease mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded subunits. Saturated  acids induced oxidative stress and caused mtDNA oxidative damage. This effect was prevented by inhibiting NADPH oxidase. These acids activated NADPH oxidase gene expression and increased NADPH oxidase activity. Silencing this oxidase abrogated totally the inhibitory effect of palmitic acid on OXPHOS complex activity. We conclude that saturated  acids caused nitro-oxidative stress, reduced OXPHOS complex half-life and activity, and decreased gene expression of mtDNA-encoded subunits. These effects were mediated by activation of NADPH oxidase. That is, these acids reproduced mitochondrial dysfunction found in humans and animals with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.© 2015.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of tryptophan supplementation on the biochemical profiles, intestinal structure,  structure and serum metabolome in rats. Rats received daily intragastric administration of either tryptophan at doses of 200 mg/kg body weight per day or saline (control group) for 7 days. TRP supplementation had a tendency to decrease the body weight of rats (P > 0.05). The levels of urea and CHO in serum were decreased in the TRP-supplemented group rats compared with control group rats (P < 0.05). TRP supplementation increased the villus height and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth in the jejunum compared to control group rats (P < 0.05). Metabolic effects of tryptophan supplementation include: (1) increases in the serum concentrations of lysine, glycine, alanine, glutamate, glutamine, citrulline, methionine, , 1-methylhistidine, and albumin, and decreases in the concentrations of serum branched-chain amino acid (isoleucine, valine and leucine); (2) decreases in the serum concentrations of formate and nitrogenous products (trimethylamine, TMAO, methylamine and dimethylamine), and in the contraction of trimethylamine in feces; (3) decreases in serum levels of lipids, low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, together with the elevated ratio of acetoacetate to β-hydroxybutyrate.

Restriction of zinc from cells can induce ER stress, indicating that zinc is essential to maintain normal ER function. However, a role for zinc during hepatic ER stress is largely unknown despite important roles in metabolic disorders, including obesity and nonalcoholic  disease. We have explored a role for the metal transporter ZIP14 during pharmacologically and high-fat diet-induced ER stress using  (KO) mice, which exhibit impaired hepatic zinc uptake. Here, we report that ZIP14-mediated hepatic zinc uptake is critical for adaptation to ER stress, preventing sustained apoptosis and steatosis. Impaired hepatic zinc uptake in  KO mice during ER stress coincides with greater expression of proapoptotic proteins. ER stress-induced  KO mice show greater levels of hepatic steatosis due to higher expression of genes involved in de novo  acid synthesis, which are suppressed in ER stress-induced WT mice. During ER stress, the UPR-activated transcription factors ATF4 and ATF6α transcriptionally up-regulate  expression. We propose ZIP14 mediates zinc transport into hepatocytes to inhibit protein- phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) activity, which acts to suppress apoptosis and steatosis associated with hepatic ER stress.  KO mice showed greater hepatic PTP1B activity during ER stress. These results show the importance of zinc trafficking and functional ZIP14 transporter activity for adaptation to ER stress associated with chronic metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29923728>Intestinal Microbial and Metabolic Profiling of Mice Fed with High-Glucose and High-Fructose Diets.</a></h1><p>Increased sugar intake is implicated in Type-2 diabetes and  disease; however, the mechanisms through which glucose and fructose promote these conditions are unclear. We hypothesize that alterations in intestinal metabolite and microbiota profiles specific to each monosaccharide are involved. Two groups of six adult C57BL/6 mice were fed for 10-weeks with diets with glucose (G) or fructose (F) as sole carbohydrates, and a third group was fed with a normal chow carbohydrate mixture (N). Fecal metabolites were profiled by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and microbial composition by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Although N, G and F mice exhibited similar weight gains (with slight slower gains for F) and glucose tolerance, multivariate analysis of NMR data indicated that F mice were separated from N and G, with decreased butyrate and glutamate and increased fructose, succinate, taurine, , and xylose. The different sugar diets also resulted in distinct intestinal microbiota profiles. That associated with fructose seemed to hold more potential to induce host metabolic disturbances compared to glucose, mainly by promoting bile acid deconjugation and taurine release and compromising intestinal barrier integrity. This may reflect the noted nonquantitative intestinal fructose absorption hence increasing its availability for microbial metabolism, a subject for further investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246326>Oral Glutamine Supplementation Protects Female Mice from Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Genetic factors, a diet rich in fat and sugar, and an impaired intestinal barrier function are critical in the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach was firstly applied to study the serum metabolic differences in mice. Metabolomics analysis was performed using ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) together with multivariate statistical data analysis. The results showed that Plantaginis semen can mainly improve blood lipids, some degree in blood glucose and insulin levels in high-fat mice, in addition, the phenotype of  and fat stained sections demonstrated remarkable results. A total of 22 metabolites involved in arachidonic acid, glycerophospholipid, glycosphingolipid, linoleate, Omega-3  acid, phosphatidylinositol phosphate and  metabolisms were identified. In further, it was found that the possible mechanisms of Plantaginis semen on hyperlipidemic mice lied in the biosynthesis of thyroxine, biological effects of enzymes of phospholipase A2 activity, glucosylceramide synthase and inositol essential enzyme 1α, genes expressions of  acid metabolism and inflammation.

Production of reactive oxygen species plays a pivotal role in PA-induced insulin resistance in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes. Recently, we found that exosomes secreted from INS-1 cells that were transfected with neutral ceramidase (NCDase) plasmids had raised NCDase activity; these NCDase-enriched exosomes could inhibit PA-induced INS-1 cell apoptosis. Here, we showed that PA reduced insulin-stimulated  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 2 and decreased insulin-stimulated uptake of the fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG, confirming that insulin resistance occurred in PA-treated H4IIEC3 cells. Moreover, NCDase-enriched exosomes from INS-1 cells rescued PA-induced H4IIEC3 insulin resistance and blocked PA-induced reactive oxygen species production in which ceramide was involved.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29620215>Integrated analysis of the gene expression profile and DNA methylation profile of obese patients with type 2 diabetes.</a></h1><p>In order to better understand the etiology of obese type 2 diabetes (T2D) at the molecular level, the present study investigated the gene expression and DNA methylation profiles associated with T2D via systemic analysis. Gene expression (GSE64998) and DNA methylation profiles (GSE65057) from  tissues of healthy controls and obese patients with T2D were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially‑expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially‑methylated genes (DMGs) were identified using the Limma package, and their overlapping genes were additionally determined. Enrichment analysis was performed using the BioCloud platform on the DEGs and the overlapping genes. Using Cytoscape software, protein‑protein interaction (PPI), transcription factor target networks and microRNA (miRNA) target networks were then constructed in order to determine associated hub genes. In addition, a further GSE15653 dataset was utilized in order to validate the DEGs identified in the GSE64998 dataset analyses. A total of 251 DEGs, including 124 upregulated and 127 downregulated genes, were detected, and a total of 9,698 genes were demonstrated to be differentially methylated in obese patients with T2D compared with non‑obese healthy controls. A total of 103 overlapping genes between the two datasets were revealed, including 47 upregulated genes and 56 downregulated genes. The identified overlapping genes were revealed to be strongly associated with  acid and glucose metabolic pathways, in addition to oxidation/reduction. The overlapping genes cyclin D1 (CCND1), PPARG coactivator α (PPARGC1A),  acid synthase (FASN), glucokinase (GCK), steraroyl‑coA desaturase (SCD) and  aminotransferase (TAT) had higher degrees in the PPI, transcription target networks and miRNA target networks. In addition, among the 251 DEGs, a total of 35 DEGs were validated to be being shared genes between the datasets, which included a number of key genes in the PPI network, including CCND1, FASN and TAT. Abnormal gene expression and DNA methylation patterns that were implicated in  acid and glucose metabolic pathways and oxidation/reduction reactions were detected in obese patients with T2D. Furthermore, the CCND1, PPARGC1A, FANS, GCK, SCD and TAT genes may serve a role in the development of obesity‑associated T2D.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25662863>Maternal nicotine exposure leads to higher  oxidative stress and steatosis in adult rat offspring.</a></h1><p>Early nicotine exposure causes future obesity and insulin resistance. We evaluated the long-term effect of the maternal nicotine exposure during lactation in  oxidative status, insulin sensitivity and morphology in adult offspring. Two days after birth, osmotic minipumps were implanted in the dams: nicotine (N), 6 mg/kg/day for 14 days or saline (C). Offspring were killed at 180 days. Protein content of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, nitrotyrosine, 4HNE, IRS1, Akt1 and PPARs were measured. MDA, bound protein carbonyl content, SOD, GPx and catalase activities were determined in  and plasma. Hepatic morphology and triglycerides content were evaluated. Albumin and bilirubin were determined. In plasma, N offspring had higher catalase activity, and SOD/GPx ratio, albumin and bilirubin levels but lower MDA content. In , they presented higher MDA and 4HNE levels, bound protein carbonyl content, SOD activity but lower GPx activity. N offspring presented an increase of lipid droplet, higher triglyceride content and a trend to lower PPARα in  despite unchanged insulin signaling pathway. Early nicotine exposure causes oxidative stress in  at adulthood, while protect against oxidative stress at plasma level. In addition, N offspring develop  microsteatosis, which is related to oxidative stress but not to insulin resistance.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Review of the literature.</a></h1><p>Fetuin-A, also called Alpha 2-Heremans Schmid Glycoprotein, is a multifunctional plasma agent what has been proven in animal and human studies. It plays a role as a physiological inhibitor of insulin receptor  kinase associated with insulin resistance and a negative acute phase reactant. It also regulates bone remodeling and calcium metabolism being an important inhibitor of calcium salt precipitation and vascular calcifications.PubMed database was searched for articles from 2002 up to December 2014 to identify the role of fetuin-A in the pathogenesis of selected internal diseases.Due to secretion of fetuin-A mainly by the , it may be a marker of  function and predictor of mortality in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. The associations between high fetuin-A and metabolic syndrome as well as its hepatic manifestation- nonalcoholic  disease and atherogenic lipid profile have been well proven. However, fetuin-A relation with BMI is not so clear. Contrary to few reports, many authors suggest that fetuin-A may be an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes and marker of diabetic complications. Close associations of high and low fetuin-A concentrations with cardiovascular diseases and mortality risk have been reported which is explained by differences in analyzed populations, stages of atherosclerosis and calcifications, coexistence of type 2 diabetes or kidney dysfunction and different main pathways of fetuin-A actions in various diseases.Fetuin-A has a diagnostic potential as a biomarker for  dysfunction, cardiovascular diseases and disorders associated with metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29879345>[Investigating the effects of compound WS090152 on non-alcoholic  in mice].</a></h1><p>To investigate the effects and the mechanism of compound WS090152 on non-alcoholic  (NAFL), the compound was administrated in C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat diet at 50 mg·kg(-1) by lavage. The lipid accumulation in  was determined by the content of hepatic triglyceride (TG) and the histological pathological analysis. The levels of body weight gain, serum total cholesterol (TC) and TG were measured to evaluate lipid metabolism. Insulin sensitivity was determined by glucose infusion rate (GIR) value in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp test. The expression of related proteins in  was measured by Western blot. The effect on the target protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was assessed by the activity of recombinate human PTP1B in vitro, and by the expressions of PTP1B in vivo, respectively. The content of hepatic TG (P<0.05) and the pathological changes of the livers (P<0.01) were attenuated, insulin resistance was improved, (P<0.01), and the levels of serum TC (P<0.01) and serum TG (P<0.05) were reduced by WS090152 treatment in the mice. The recombinant h PTP1B activity was significantly inhibited with IC50 value of 0.34 μmol·L(-1); the expression of PTP1B was significantly downregulated, and the phosphorylation of its downstream insulin receptor (IR), and AKT was upregulated by WS090152 administration in the livers of NAFL mice. The expression of hepatic lipogenesis-related proteins-1c (SREBP-1c),  acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was attenuated. These results suggest that compound WS090152 can ameliorate NAFL by increasing insulin sensitivity and decreasing hepatic lipogenesis probably through inhibition of PTP1B.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28640223>Non-Targeted Metabolomics Analysis of the Effects of  Kinase Inhibitors Sunitinib and Erlotinib on Heart, Muscle,  and Serum Metabolism In Vivo.</a></h1><p> More than 90  kinases have been implicated in the pathogenesis of malignant transformation and tumor angiogenesis.  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have emerged as effective therapies in treating cancer by exploiting this kinase dependency. The TKI erlotinib targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), whereas sunitinib targets primarily vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR).TKIs that impact the function of non-malignant cells and have on- and off-target toxicities, including cardiotoxicities. Cardiotoxicity is very rare in patients treated with erlotinib, but considerably more common after sunitinib treatment. We hypothesized that the deleterious effects of TKIs on the heart were related to their impact on cardiac metabolism.  Female FVB/N mice (10/group) were treated with therapeutic doses of sunitinib (40 mg/kg), erlotinib (50 mg/kg), or vehicle daily for two weeks. Echocardiographic assessment of the heart in vivo was performed at baseline and on Day 14. Heart, skeletal muscle,  and serum were flash frozen and prepped for non-targeted GC-MS metabolomics analysis.  Compared to vehicle-treated controls, sunitinib-treated mice had significant decreases in systolic function, whereas erlotinib-treated mice did not. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis of heart identified significant decreases in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid (AA)/ eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), O-phosphocolamine, and 6-hydroxynicotinic acid after sunitinib treatment. DHA was significantly decreased in skeletal muscle (quadriceps femoris), while elevated cholesterol was identified in  and elevated ethanolamine identified in serum. In contrast, erlotinib affected only one metabolite (spermidine significantly increased).  Mice treated with sunitinib exhibited systolic dysfunction within two weeks, with significantly lower heart and skeletal muscle levels of long chain omega-3  acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid (AA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and increased serum O-phosphocholine phospholipid. This is the first link between sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity and depletion of the polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) and inflammatory mediators DHA and AA/EPA in the heart. These compounds have important roles in maintaining mitochondrial function, and their loss may contribute to cardiac dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881991>A Metabolomic Study on the Intervention of Traditional Chinese Medicine Qushi Huayu Decoction on Rat Model of  Induced by High-Fat Diet.</a></h1><p>Qushi Huayu Decoction (QHD), an important clinically proved herbal formula, has been reported to be effective in treating  induced by high-fat diet in rats. However, the mechanism of action has not been clarified at the metabolic level. In this study, a urinary metabolomic method based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled with pattern recognition analysis was performed in three groups (control, model, and QHD group), to explore the effect of QHD on  and its mechanism of action. There was obvious separation between the model group and control group, and the QHD group showed a tendency of recovering to the control group in metabolic profiles. Twelve candidate biomarkers were identified and used to explore the possible mechanism. Then, a pathway analysis was performed using MetaboAnalyst 3.0 to illustrate the pathways of therapeutic action of QHD. QHD reversed the urinary metabolite abnormalities (tryptophan, uridine, and phenylalanine, etc.).  might be prevented by QHD through regulating the dysfunctions of phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism.

However, whether these changes are an early event in the development of NAFLD or are primarily associated with later stages of the disease, has not yet been clarified. Using a pair-feeding model, we determined the effects of a short-term intake of a fat-, fructose- and cholesterol-rich diet (FFC) on the development of early hepatic steatosis and markers of intestinal barrier function in mice treated with and without non-resorbable antibiotics (AB). For four days, C57BL/6J mice were either pair-fed a control diet or a FFC diet ± AB (92 mg/kg body weight (BW) polymyxin B and 216 mg/kg BW neomycin). Hepatic steatosis and markers of inflammation, lipidperoxidation and intestinal barrier function were assessed. Lipid accumulation and early signs of inflammation found in the livers of FFC-fed mice were markedly attenuated in FFC + AB-fed animals. In FFC-fed mice the development of NAFLD was associated with a significant loss of tight junction proteins and an induction of matrix metalloproteinase-13 in the upper parts of the small intestine as well as significantly higher portal endotoxin levels and an induction of dependent signaling cascades in the . As expected, portal endotoxin levels and the expression of dependent signaling cascades in  tissue were almost at the level of controls in FFC + AB-fed mice. However, FFC + AB-fed mice were also protected from the loss of zonula occludens-1 and partially of occludin protein in small intestine. Our data suggest that the development of early diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice at least in part results from alterations of intestinal barrier function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433263>Serum Nutritional Markers as Prognostic Factors for Hepatic and Extrahepatic Carcinogenesis in Japanese Patients with Nonalcoholic  Disease.</a></h1><p>Serum zinc (Zn) levels and the branched chain amino acid/ molar ratio (BTR) were reported to decrease with the progression of various chronic  diseases. We investigated the impact of BTR and Zn on the incidence of malignancies in patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). A total of 179 Japanese NAFLD patients who underwent  biopsy were enrolled. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and extrahepatic malignancies developed in 7 (3.9%) and 10 (5.6%) patients, respectively, during the follow-up period (median 7.9 years). Patients with low BTR levels (<5.0) and Zn deficiency (<70 μg/dL) had significantly higher incidences of HCC and extrahepatic malignancies ( < 0.001 and 0.026), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed the following risk factors:  fibrosis (F3-4) (hazard ratio [HR] 24.292, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.802-210.621,  = 0.004) and BTR < 5.0 (HR 5.462, 95% CI 1.095-27.253,  = 0.038) for HCC, and serum Zn level <70 μg/dL (HR 3.504, 95% CI 1.010-12.157,  = 0.048) and  inflammation (A2-3) (HR 3.445, 95% CI 0.886-13.395,  = 0.074) for extra-hepatic malignancies. In conclusion, serum BTR and Zn levels were useful for predicting HCC and extrahepatic malignancies in NAFLD, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25986657>Arachidonic acid impairs hypothalamic leptin signaling and hepatic energy homeostasis in mice.</a></h1><p>Epidemiological evidence suggests that the consumption of a diet high in n-6 polyunsaturated  acids (PUFA) is associated with the development of leptin resistance and obesity. We aim to examine the central effect of n-6 PUFA, arachidonic acid (ARA) on leptin sensitivity and leptin-regulated hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. We found that intracerebroventricular injection of ARA (25 nmol/day) for 2.5 days reversed the effect of central leptin on hypothalamic JAK2, pSTAT3, pAkt, and pFOXO1 protein levels, which was concomitant with a pro-inflammatory response in the hypothalamus. ARA also attenuated the effect of central leptin on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism by reversing the mRNA expression of the genes involved in gluconeogenesis (G6Pase, PEPCK), glucose transportation (GLUT2), lipogenesis (FAS, SCD1), and cholesterol synthesis (HMG-CoA reductase). These results indicate that an increased exposure to central n-6 PUFA induces central cellular leptin resistance with concomitant defective JAK2-STAT3 and PI3K-Akt signaling.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We examined the hypothesis that bardoxolone methyl (BM) would prevent the development of insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice fed a HF diet. C57BL/6J male mice were fed a lab chow (LC), HF (40% fat), or HF diet supplemented with 10 mg/kg/day BM orally for 21 weeks. Glucose metabolism was assessed using a glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin sensitivity test (IST). Signalling molecules involved in insulin resistance, inflammation, and lipid metabolism were examined in  tissue via western blotting and RT-PCR. BM prevented HF diet-induced insulin resistance and alterations in the protein levels of protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and BDNF, and expression of the insulin receptor (IR), IRS-1 and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) genes. Furthermore, BM prevented fat accumulation in the  and decreases in the β-oxidation gene, peroxisomal acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (ACOX) in mice fed a HF diet. In the livers of HF fed mice, BM administration prevented HF diet-induced macrophage infiltration, inflammation as indicated by reduced IL-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) protein levels and TNFα mRNA expression, and increased nuclear factor-like 2 (Nrf2) mRNA expression and nuclear protein levels. These findings suggest that BM prevents HF diet induced insulin resistance and the development of hepatic steatosis in mice fed a chronic HF diet through modulation of molecules involved in insulin signalling, lipid metabolism and inflammation in the .Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Therefore, it comes as no surprise that once the balance of  phosphorylation is disturbed, drastic effects can occur. Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a classical non-transmembrane  phosphatase, is a pivotal regulator and promising drug target in type 2 diabetes and obesity. Recently it has received renewed attention in  diseases and represents an intriguing opportunity as a drug target by modulating hepatocyte death and survival, hepatic lipogenesis and so on. Here, the multiple roles of PTP1B in  diseases will be presented, with respect to  regeneration, drug-induced  disease, non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the herbal composition Gambigyeongsinhwan (4) (GGH(4)), composed of Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae), Alnus japonica (Thunb.) Steud. (Betulaceae), and the fermented traditional Korean medicine Massa Medicata Fermentata, regulates hepatic steatosis and inflammation.The effects of GGH(4) on hepatic steatosis and inflammation in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima  (OLETF) rats and HepG2 cells were examined using Oil red O, hematoxylin and eosin, and toluidine blue staining, immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) transactivation assay.Administration of GGH(4) to OLETF rats improved hepatic steatosis and lowered serum levels of alanine transaminase, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and free  acids. GGH(4) increased mRNA levels of  acid oxidation enzymes (ACOX, HD, CPT-1, and MCAD) and decreased mRNA levels of lipogenesis genes (FAS, ACC1, C/EBPα, and SREBP-1c) in the  of OLETF rats. In addition, infiltration of inflammatory cells and expression of inflammatory cytokines (CD68, TNFα, and MCP-1) in  tissue were reduced by GGH(4). Treatment of HepG2 cells with a mixture of oleic acid and palmitoleic acid induced significant lipid accumulation, but GGH(4) inhibited lipid accumulation by regulating the expression of hepatic  acid oxidation and lipogenic genes. GGH(4) also increased PPARα reporter gene expression. These effects of GGH(4) were similar to those of the PPARα activator fenofibrate, whereas the PPARα antagonist GW6471 reversed the inhibitory effects of GGH(4) on lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.These results suggest that GGH(4) inhibits obesity-induced hepatic steatosis and that this process may be mediated by regulation of the expression of PPARα target genes and lipogenic genes. GGH(4) also suppressed obesity-related hepatic inflammation. Thus, GGH(4) may be a promising drug for the treatment of obesity-related  diseases.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We employed LBW, generated via uterine artery ablation, and normal birth weight (NBW) male guinea pigs fed either a WD or control diet (CD) from weaning to postnatal day 150 (early adulthood). Hepatic steatosis was absent in CD-fed offspring, while NBW/WD offspring displayed macrovesicular steatosis and LBW/WD offspring exhibited microvesicular steatosis, both occurring in a lean phenotype. Life-long consumption of the WD, irrespective of birth weight, was associated with an increase in hepatic medium- and long-chain saturated  acids, monounsaturated  acids, acylcarnitines, reduced oxidative phosphorylation complex III activity and polyunsaturated  acids, and molecular evidence of disrupted hepatic insulin signaling. In NBW/WD, hepatic C15:1 and C16:1n-6  acids in phospholipids, C16, C18 and C18:1 acylcarnitines, concentrations of aspartate, phenylalanine,  and tryptophan and expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 alpha (CPT1α) and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) genes were elevated compared to LBW/WD livers. Our results suggest that LBW and life-long WD combined are influential in promoting hepatic microvesicular steatosis in conjunction with a specific mitochondrial gene expression and metabolomic profile in early adulthood.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Drug-resistant cancer cells frequently exhibit sphingolipid dysregulation, reducing chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity via the induction of ceramide-degrading enzymes. However, the role of ceramide in sorafenib therapy and resistance in HCC has not been clearly established. Our data reveals that ceramide-modifying enzymes, particularly glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), are upregulated during sorafenib treatment in hepatoma cells (HepG2 and Hep3B), and more importantly, in sorafenib-resistant cell lines. GCS silencing or pharmacological GCS inhibition sensitized hepatoma cells to sorafenib exposure. GCS inhibition, combined with sorafenib, triggered cytochrome c release and ATP depletion in sorafenib-treated hepatoma cells, leading to mitochondrial cell death after energetic collapse. Conversely, genetic GCS overexpression increased sorafenib resistance. Of interest, GCS inhibition improved sorafenib effectiveness in a xenograft mouse model, recovering drug sensitivity of sorafenib-resistant tumors in mice. In conclusion, our results reveal GCS induction as a mechanism of sorafenib resistance, suggesting that GCS targeting may be a novel strategy to increase sorafenib efficacy in HCC management, and point to target the mitochondria as the subcellular location where sorafenib therapy could be potentiated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27032902>Short-term aerobic exercise training improves gut peptide regulation in nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h1><p>Obesity-related nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is now the most common chronic  disease. Exercise and diet are uniformly prescribed treatments for NAFLD; however, there are limited empirical data on the effects of exercise training on metabolic function in these patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the fasting and glucose-stimulated adaptation of gut peptides to short-term aerobic exercise training in patients with NAFLD. Twenty-two obese subjects, 16 with NAFLD [body mass index (BMI), 33.2 ± 1.1 (SE) kg/m(2)] and 6 obese controls (BMI, 31.3 ± 1.2 kg/m(2)), were enrolled in a supervised aerobic exercise program (60 min/day, 85% of their heart rate maximum, for 7 days). Fasting and glucose-stimulated glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-17-36) and peptide   (PYYTotal) concentrations in plasma were assessed before and after the exercise program. Initially, the NAFLD group had higher fasting PYY (NAFLD = 117 ± 18.6, control = 47.2 ± 6.4 pg/ml, P < 0.05) and GLP-1 (NAFLD = 12.4 ± 2.2, control = 6.2 ± 0.2 pg/ml, P < 0.05) and did not significantly increase GLP-1 or PYY in response to glucose ingestion. After the exercise program, fasting GLP-1 was reduced in the NAFLD group (10.7 ± 2.0 pg/ml, P < 0.05). Furthermore, exercise training led to significant increase in the acute (0-30 min) PYY and GLP-1 responses to glucose in the NAFLD group, while the total area under the glucose-stimulated GLP-1 response curve was reduced in both NAFLD and controls (P < 0.05). In summary, 7 days of vigorous aerobic exercise normalized the dynamic PYY and GLP-1 responses to nutrient stimulation and reduced the GLP-1 response in NAFLD, suggesting that exercise positively modulates gut hormone regulation in obese adults with NAFLD.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26082668> levels are associated with insulin resistance in patients with nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h1><p>Amino acid imbalance is often found in patients with cirrhosis, and this imbalance is associated with insulin resistance. However, the mechanism underlying the relationship between amino acid imbalance and insulin resistance remains unclear. We evaluated serum amino acid concentrations in patients with nonalcoholic  disease to determine if any of the levels of amino acids were associated with the biochemical markers and fibrosis stage of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).In 137 patients with nonalcoholic  disease who underwent  biopsy, plasma levels of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA),  (Tyr), and the BCAA-to-Tyr ratio values were determined using mass spectroscopy. These values were then assessed for associations with fibrosis stage, anthropometric markers (age, sex, and body mass index), biochemical markers (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, albumin, platelet count, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin), and relevant disease-specific biomarkers (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], serum iron, ferritin, leptin, adiponectin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and hyaluronic acid).Serum albumin levels, plasma BCAA levels, and BCAA-to-Tyr ratio values were negatively associated with the fibrosis stage. In contrast, Tyr levels increased with increasing fibrotic staging. Tyr levels were also correlated with HOMA-IR results.Plasma BCAA levels in patients with NASH decreased with increasing  fibrosis, while Tyr levels increased with increasing fibrotic stage. These results suggest that amino acid imbalance and insulin resistance are intimately involved in a complex pathogenic mechanism for NASH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26026874>Sirt1 mediates the effect of the heme oxygenase inducer, cobalt protoporphyrin, on ameliorating  metabolic damage caused by a high-fat diet.</a></h1><p>Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1)-mediated increases in adiponectin, ameliorate the deleterious effects of obesity and metabolic syndrome; however, the effect of HO-1 on hepatic lipid metabolism remains elusive. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of HO-1 in hepatic lipid metabolism.Functional studies were performed using C57BL/6J (WT) mice and Sirt1  specific mutant (Sirt1-deficient) mice. The molecular mechanism was explored in primary hepatocytes and mouse .Chronic exposure to high-fat diet (HFD) induced hepatic steatosis in WT mice. Treatment of WT mice on HFD with cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), an inducer of HO-1 activity, decreased body weight and visceral fat content, reduced intracellular hepatic triglyceride and serum total cholesterol concentrations, and decreased  lipid droplet formation. Compared with WT mice, the administration of CoPP to Sirt1-deficient mice on HFD increased visceral fat content, and slightly promoted  lipid droplet formation. CoPP improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in WT mice on HFD, but compromised insulin sensitivity in Sirt1-deficient mice on HFD. Furthermore, CoPP-induced Sirt1 expression and decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) expression in WT mice on HFD. However, CoPP promoted SREBP-1c expression in Sirt1-deficient hepatocytes, which was reversed by a protein  phosphatase 1b inhibitor. Additionally, while the administration of CoPP to WT mice on HFD improved antioxidant and anti-inflammatory states, these CoPP-mediated effects were abolished in Sirt1-deficient mice.Sirt1 mediates the effect of CoPP on ameliorating  metabolic damage caused by HFD.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the .

The complexity of involved molecular mechanisms necessitates a systems approach. Integration of information from the transcriptomic and proteomic responses has potential to provide deeper insights into CS actions. The present report describes the tandem analysis of rich time-series transcriptomic and proteomic data in rat  after a single dose of MPL. Hierarchical clustering of the common genes represented in both mRNA and protein datasets displayed two dominant patterns. One of these patterns exhibited complementary mRNA and protein expression profiles indicating that MPL affected the regulation of these genes at the transcriptional level. Some of the classic pharmacodynamic markers for CS actions, including  aminotransferase (TAT), were among this group, together with genes encoding urea cycle enzymes and ribosomal proteins. The other pattern was rather unexpected. For this group of genes, MPL had distinctly observable effects at the protein expression level, although a change in the reverse direction occurred at the transcriptional level. These genes were functionally associated with metabolic processes that might be essential to elucidate side effects of MPL on , most importantly including modulation of oxidative stress,  acid oxidation, and bile acid biosynthesis. Furthermore, profiling of gene and protein expression data was also done independently of one another by a two-way sequential approach. Prominent temporal shifts in expression and relevant cellular functions were described together with the assessment of changes in the complementary side.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191323>Role of Myeloid-Epithelial-Reproductive  Kinase and Macrophage Polarization in the Progression of Atherosclerotic Lesions Associated With Nonalcoholic  Disease.</a></h1><p>Recent lines of evidence highlight the involvement of myeloid-epithelial-reproductive  kinase (MerTK) in metabolic disease associated with  damage. MerTK is mainly expressed in anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages where it mediates transcriptional changes including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancement of inflammatory repressors. MerTK is regulated by metabolic pathways through nuclear sensors including LXRs, PPARs, and RXRs, in response to apoptotic bodies or to other sources of cholesterol. Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. It is a clinicopathological syndrome closely related to obesity, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. It includes a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis, characterized by hepatic fat accumulation with or without inflammation, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined by hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and accumulating fibrosis. Several studies support an association between NAFLD and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a major cause of death worldwide. This pathological condition consists in a chronic and progressive inflammatory process in the intimal layer of large- and medium-sized arteries. The complications of advanced atherosclerosis include chronic or acute ischemic damage in the tissue perfused by the affected artery, leading to cellular death. By identifying specific targets influencing lipid metabolism and cardiovascular-related diseases, the present review highlights the role of MerTK in NAFLD-associated atherosclerotic lesions as a potential innovative therapeutic target. Therapeutic advantages might derive from the use of compounds selective for nuclear receptors targeting PPARs rather than LXRs regulating macrophage lipid metabolism and macrophage mediated inflammation, by favoring the expression of MerTK, which mediates an immunoregulatory action with a reduction in inflammation and in atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526812>Soluble Axl is an accurate biomarker of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma development: results from a large scale multicenter analysis.</a></h1><p>Patients with chronic  disease (CLD) and cirrhosis are at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Current diagnostic tools for HCC detection include imaging techniques and serum biomarkers such as α-fetoprotein (AFP). Yet, these methods are limited in sensitivity and specificity to accurately detect early HCC. Here we focused on the potential of soluble Axl (sAxl) as a biomarker in CLD patients by analyzing serum samples of 1067 patients and healthy controls from centers in Europe and Asia. We show that serum concentrations of sAxl were significantly increased at early (82.57 ng/mL) and later stages of HCC (114.50 ng/mL) as compared to healthy controls (40.15 ng/mL). Notably, no elevated sAxl levels were detected in patients with CLD including chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, cholestatic  disease, or non-alcoholic  disease versus healthy controls. Furthermore, sAxl did not rise in  adenomas or cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Yet, patients with advanced fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis (F4) showed enhanced sAxl concentrations (F3: 54.67 ng/mL; F4: 94.74 ng/mL). Hepatic myofibroblasts exhibited an increased release of sAxl, suggesting that elevated sAxl levels arise from these cells during fibrosis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of sAxl displayed a strongly increased sensitivity and specificity to detect both cirrhosis (80.8%/92.0%) and HCC (83.3%/86.7%) with an area under the curve of 0.935/0.903 as compared to AFP. In conclusion, sAxl shows high diagnostic accuracy at early stage HCC as well as cirrhosis, thereby outperforming AFP. Importantly, sAxl remains normal in most common CLDs,  adenomas and CCA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27628583>Serum fetuin B level increased in subjects of nonalcoholic  disease: a case-control study.</a></h1><p>Fetuin is an endogenous inhibitor of the insulin receptor  kinase. Recent studies supported the possible role of fetuin B in metabolic diseases. This study is to evaluate the role of serum fetuin B in nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). A hospital-based case-control study of 184 subjects was conducted. Serum level of fetuin B was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The serum level of fetuin B in the control (91.0 ± 36.9 μg/ml) was lower than it in NAFLD (108.7 ± 38.5 μg/ml, P < 0.001). The percentage of NAFLD increased (42.9%, 58.7% and 60.2%; P < 0.001; linear-by-linear association: P < 0.001), as fetuin B concentration elevated in its tertiles, after adjustment of body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, compared with the 1st tertile, the 3rd tertile of fetuin B indicated an association with the presence of NAFLD (adjusted odds ratio = 2.087, 95% confidence interval [1.016 - 3.937], P = 0.023), after controlling age, sex, BMI, diabetes, hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia. Lastly, fetuin B correlated with diastolic blood pressure, serum alanine transaminase and triglycerides, among the controls.

This is clearly evident from the composition of Ayurvedic preparation for diabetes 'Nisakathakadi Kashayam' where this is one of the main ingredients of this preparation AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aims in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the insulin sensitizing effects of Symplocos cochinchinensis ethanol extract (SCE) using a high fructose and saturated fat (HFS) fed insulin resistant rat model.Experimental groups consisted of normal diet (ND), ND+SCE 500mg/kg bwd, HFS+vehicle, HFS+metformin 100mg/kg bwd, HFS+SCE 250/500mg/kg bwd. Initially the animals were kept under HFS diet for 8 weeks, and at the end of 8 week period, animals were found to develop insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Post-administration of SCE, metformin or vehicle were carried out for 3 weeks. Gene and protein expressions relevant to insulin signalling pathway were analysed.HFS significantly altered the normal physiology of animals via proteins and genes relevant to metabolism like stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c),  acid synthase (FAS), glucose 6 phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), protein  phosphatse 1B (PTP1B), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and glucokinase. SCE administration attenuates the insulin resistance in HFS rat by the down regulation of SCD1 gene expression that modulates SREBP-1c dependent and independent hepatic lipid accumulation.SCE enhances insulin sensitivity via the down regulation of lipogenesis and insulin resistance in HFS rat model.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

NAFLD begins with excessive lipid accumulation in the  and progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. NAFLD is closely linked to dysregulated hepatic lipid metabolism. Although recent studies have reported that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling regulates lipid metabolism, the roles of EGFR and EGFR inhibitors as modulators of lipid metabolism are largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether inhibiting EGFR using the EGFR  kinase inhibitor (TKI) PD153035 improves NAFLD. Our results demonstrate that EGFR was activated in  tissues from high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice. Inhibiting EGFR using PD153035 significantly reduced phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling and sterol responsive elementary binding protein 1 and 2 expression, which prevented HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and hypercholesterolemia by reducing de novo lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis and enhancing  acid oxidation. Additionally, inhibiting EGFR improved HFD-induced glucose intolerance. In conclusion, these results indicate that EGFR plays an important role in NAFLD and is a potential therapeutic target.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27836788>Regression of fibrosis/cirrhosis by Glycine propionyl-l-carnitine treatment in d-Galactosamine induced chronic  damage.</a></h1><p> fibrosis and cirrhosis are leading causes of morbidity and mortality, with majority of preventable cases attributed to excessive alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, or non-alcoholic  disease. We previously reported the hepatoprotective effect of Glycine propionyl-l-carnitine (GPLC) against the fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) induced by d-Galactosamine (D-GalN). In this study we evaluated the protective effect of GPLC against D-GalN induced chronic  damage.Animals received D-GalN twice a week for 12 weeks at a dose of 250 mg/kg body weight (BW). GPLC was given daily for 12 weeks as co-treatment along with D-GalN at a dose of 35 mg/kg BW.D-GalN injection resulted in a considerable decrease in body weight, hepatocellular disintegration, necrosis and lipid peroxidation as evident from altered levels of SOD, CAT and MDA while GPLC significantly restored the reduced body weight and ameliorated hepatocellular damage and lipid peroxidation. D-GalN administration resulted in DNA damage as evident from TUNEL positive cells in disease control rats while; GPLC significantly alleviated the genotoxic effects of D-GalN. Further histopathological analysis revealed significant tissue and cellular damage, and increased collagen content in D-GalN challenged rats. GPLC however ameliorated the damage as evident from normal cellular and morphological architecture in GPLC co-treated rats. Hydroxyproline and nitrotyrosine (NTY) levels marked a significant decrease in GPLC co-treated rats relative to disease control. GPLC significantly blocked D-GalN induced pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6) production and at the same time inhibited the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen-I (COL-I) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) significantly.Our results demonstrate significant protective activity of GPLC in chronic  damage and other complications related to it. This study is a novel study to demonstrate the hepatoprotective effect of GPLC in chronic  damage.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We previously found that colorectal cancer tumor-initiating cells (TICs) expressing CD110, the thrombopoietin (TPO)-binding receptor, mediate  metastasis. Here, we show that TPO promotes metastasis of CD110+ TICs to the  by activating lysine degradation. Lysine catabolism generates acetyl-CoA, which is used in p300-dependent LRP6 acetylation. This triggers  phosphorylation of LRP6, ultimately activating Wnt signaling to promote self-renewal of CD110+ TICs. Lysine catabolism also generates glutamate, which modulates the redox status of CD110+ TICs to promote  colonization and drug resistance. Mechanistically, TPO-mediated induction of c-myc orchestrates recruitment of chromatin modifiers to regulate metabolic gene expression.

Recently, we demonstrated that in mice, combined inhibition of these two signaling pathways abolished  regeneration after hepatectomy, with subsequent hepatic failure and death at 15 to 18 days after resection. Morbidity was associated with distinct and specific alterations in important downstream signaling pathways that led to decreased hepatocyte volume, reduced proliferation, and shutdown of many essential hepatocyte functions, such as  acid synthesis, urea cycle, and mitochondrial functions. Herein, we explore the role of MET and EGFR signaling in resting mouse livers that are not subjected to hepatectomy. Mice with combined disruption of MET and EGFR signaling were noticeably sick by 10 days and died at 12 to 14 days. Mice with combined disruption of MET and EGFR signaling mice showed decreased /body weight ratios, increased apoptosis in nonparenchymal cells, impaired  metabolic functions, and activation of distinct downstream signaling pathways related to inflammation, cell death, and survival. The present study demonstrates that, in addition to controlling the regenerative response, MET and EGFR synergistically control baseline  homeostasis in normal mice in such a way that their combined disruption leads to  failure and death.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

The present study identifies high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as a key mediator of intestinal inflammation in NAFLD and outlines a detailed redox signaling mechanism for such a pathway. NAFLD mice showed  damage and release of elevated HMGB1 in systemic circulation and increased intestinal  nitration that was dependent on NADPH oxidase. Intestines from NAFLD mice showed higher Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation and proinflammatory cytokine release, an outcome strongly dependent on the existence of NAFLD pathology and NADPH oxidase. Mechanistically intestinal epithelial cells showed the HMGB1 activation of TLR-4 was both NADPH oxidase and peroxynitrite dependent with the latter being formed by the activation of NADPH oxidase. Proinflammatory cytokine production was significantly blocked by the specific peroxynitrite scavenger phenyl boronic acid (FBA), AKT inhibition and NADPH oxidase inhibitor Apocynin suggesting NADPH oxidase-dependent peroxynitrite is a key mediator in TLR-4 activation and cytokine release via an AKT dependent pathway. Studies to ascertain the mechanism of HMGB1-mediated NADPH oxidase activation showed a distinct role of Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) as the use of inhibitors targeted against RAGE or use of deformed HMGB1 protein prevented NADPH oxidase activation, peroxynitrite formation, TLR4 activation and finally cytokine release. Thus, in conclusion the present study identifies a novel role of HMGB1 mediated inflammatory pathway that is RAGE and redox signaling dependent and helps promote ectopic intestinal inflammation in NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Also, attempts were made to determine whether dietary betaine (BET) resulted in any improvement in the changes that occurred after CHOL + MET administration.Guinea pigs were fed chow containing 1.5% CHOL with or without 2% MET for 10 wk. A third group received the CHOL + MET + BET diet. Control groups were given standard chow or standard chow + BET.

The  and aorta were subjected to histopathologic analysis.The CHOL + MET diet caused higher serum CHOL and homocysteine levels, but no further increases were seen in aortic CHOL and diene conjugate (DC) levels and histopathologic lesions as compared with the CHOL group. Hepatic lipids and DC levels were also higher, and histopathologic lesions were more severe. CHOL + MET feeding increased ADMA and NT levels as compared with those of the CHOL-fed group. When BET (1 g/kg body weight/d) was added to the CHOL + MET diet, homocysteine and lipid levels decreased and histopathologic changes were reversed. BET diet decreased serum ADMA and hepatic and aortic DC levels and partly restored DDAH activity.BET supplementation may be effective in preventing hyperlipidemia, disturbed NO availability, oxidative stress, and the development of  and atherosclerotic lesions that might result from excess amounts of cholesterol and methionine in the diet.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, this study was undertaken to study the abnormalities in carnitine/acylcarnitine and amino acid profile in ALF.A prospective study was performed including all patients with ALF, and detailed evaluation including metabolic testing was done.A total of 55 patients (33 pediatric and 22 adult patients) were included in the study. Three patients (a 1-year 6-month-old child, a 13-year-old adolescent, and a 21-year-old adult, ie, 5.5% of all) were identified for the study with underlying metabolic etiology, that is, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 deficiency, based on the abnormal carnitine/acylcarnitine profile. Almost three-fourths of patients (78%) had evidence of serum hyperaminoacidemia. Thirty-one patients (56%) had evidence of abnormal carnitine/acylcarnitine profile with predominant abnormality being low free carnitine (C0). Higher levels of serum  (P = 0.002) and lower levels of serum C0 (P = 0.032) in children and higher levels of serum phenyalanine (P = 0.047) in adults predicted poor outcome (death/ transplant) on univariate analysis.FAODs are not uncommon in ALF with a suggested prevalence of approximately 5.5%.

Recently, global Bace1 deletion was shown to protect against diet-induced obesity and diabetes, suggesting that BACE1 is a potential regulator of glucose homeostasis. Here, we investigated whether increased neuronal BACE1 is sufficient to alter systemic glucose metabolism, using a neuron-specific human BACE1 knockin mouse model (PLB4).Glucose homeostasis and adiposity were determined by glucose tolerance tests and EchoMRI, lipid species were measured by quantitative lipidomics, and biochemical and molecular alterations were assessed by western blotting, quantitative PCR and ELISAs. Glucose uptake in the brain and upper body was measured via (18)FDG-PET imaging.Physiological and molecular analyses demonstrated that centrally expressed human BACE1 induced systemic glucose intolerance in mice from 4 months of age onward, alongside a  phenotype and impaired hepatic glycogen storage. This diabetic phenotype was associated with hypothalamic pathology, i.e. deregulation of the melanocortin system, and advanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress indicated by elevated central C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) signalling and hyperphosphorylation of its regulator eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). In vivo (18)FDG-PET imaging further confirmed brain glucose hypometabolism in these mice; this corresponded with altered neuronal insulin-related signalling, enhanced protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) levels, along with upregulation of the ribosomal protein and lipid translation machinery. Increased forebrain and plasma lipid accumulation (i.e. ceramides, triacylglycerols, phospholipids) was identified via lipidomics analysis.Our data reveal that neuronal BACE1 is a key regulator of metabolic homeostasis and provide a potential mechanism for the high prevalence of metabolic disturbance in Alzheimer's disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27723198>Comparison on the physico-chemical and nutritional qualities of normal and abnormal colored fresh chicken .</a></h1><p>This study evaluated the differences of physico-chemical and nutritional qualities between abnormal colored chicken livers (ANCCLs) and normal colored chicken livers (NCCLs) and the safety of the both livers.

However, the metabolic response of FO to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes is still inconsistent. This study aimed to explore the effect of FO on chronic high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation, mainly focusing on hepatic n-3  acid remodeling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response. The results showed that lard-based HFD feeding for 16 weeks (60% fat-derived calories) induced whole-body insulin resistance, lipid profile abnormality, and inflammation in mice, which was alleviated by FO in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, FO effectively improved hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice by modulating the specific location of ALA and its long-chain n-3  acids across hepatic lipid fractions and enhancing insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of hepatic insulin receptor subtract-1 (IRS-1)  632 and protein kinase B (AKT) ( p < 0.05).

Conversely, the HF-BZ and HF-WY mice presented with body masses equal to those of the SC mice. All treatments restored insulin sensitivity and blood lipid and adiponectin levels. Hepatic steatosis was prevented in the HF-WY and HF-BZ mice as shown by the elevated mRNA levels of PPARalpha and Carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1a in both groups, which favored enhanced beta-oxidation.

Protein  phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) was recently identified as a tumor suppressor, but little is known about its role in NASH. Here, we investigated the role of PTPRO-dependent autophagy in insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and hepatocarcinogenesis. Wild-type (WT) and ptpro-/- mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for another 16 weeks after diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection to induce NASH. Ptpro-/- mice exhibited severe  injury, insulin resistance, hepatosteatosis and autophagy deficiency compared with WT littermates. PTPRO deletion also promoted the induction of lipogenic target genes and decreases in β-oxidation-related genes. Increased activation of AKT and accumulation of cytoplasmic p53 was detected in ptpro-/- mice, which in combination repressed autophagy. Intriguingly, hyperinsulinemia involving AKT activation was also exacerbated in HFD-fed mice due to PTPRO deletion. Activation of AKT induced stabilization of the MDMX/MDM2 heterocomplex, thus promoting p53 accumulation in the cytoplasm. Inhibition of AKT restored autophagy and p53 accumulation in hepatocytes, indicating that AKT acts upstream of p53. Due to hyperinsulinemia and autophagy deficiency, a HFD could aggravate steatohepatitis in ptpro-/- mice. Importantly, the expression of PTPRO was much decreased in human steatohepatitis, which was associated with increased p62 accumulation. Together, these data indicate that PTPRO regulates insulin and lipid metabolism via the PI3K/Akt/MDM4/MDM2/P53 axis by affecting autophagy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27302565>Inhibition of spleen  kinase activation ameliorates inflammation, cell death, and steatosis in alcoholic  disease.</a></h1><p>The spectrum of alcoholic  disease (ALD) is a major cause of mortality with limited therapies available. Because alcohol targets numerous signaling pathways in hepatocytes and in immune cells, the identification of a master regulatory target that modulates multiple signaling processes is attractive. In this report, we assessed the role of spleen  kinase (SYK), a nonreceptor  kinase, which has a central modulatory role in multiple proinflammatory signaling pathways involved in the pathomechanism of ALD. Using mouse disease models that represent various phases in the progression of human ALD, we found that alcohol, in all of these models, induced SYK activation in the , both in hepatocytes and  mononuclear cells. Furthermore, significant SYK activation also occurred in  samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with ALD/alcoholic hepatitis compared to controls. Functional inhibition of SYK activation in vivo abrogated alcohol-induced hepatic neutrophil infiltration, resident immune cell activation, as well as inflammasome and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2-mediated nuclear factor kappa B activation in mice. Strikingly, inhibition of SYK activation diminished alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis and interferon regulatory factor 3-mediated apoptosis.Our data demonstrate a novel, functional, and multicellular role for SYK phosphorylation in modulating immune cell-driven  inflammation, hepatocyte cell death, and steatosis at different stages of ALD. These novel findings highlight SYK as a potential multifunctional target in the treatment of alcoholic steatohepatitis.

We hypothesized that insulin resistance from excess glucocorticoid action may be attributed in part to increased ectopic lipid deposition in .We tested this hypothesis in the adipose specific 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (HSD11B1) transgenic mouse, an established model of adipose glucocorticoid excess. Tissue specific insulin action was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, hepatic lipid content was measured, hepatic insulin signaling was assessed by immunoblotting. The role of hepatic lipid content was further probed by administration of the functionally -targeted mitochondrial uncoupler, Controlled Release Mitochondrial Protonophore (CRMP).High fat diet fed HSD11B1 transgenic mice developed more severe hepatic insulin resistance than littermate controls (endogenous suppression of hepatic glucose production was reduced by 3.8-fold, P < 0.05); this was reflected by decreased insulin-stimulated hepatic insulin receptor kinase  phosphorylation and AKT serine phosphorylation. Hepatic insulin resistance was associated with a 53% increase (P < 0.05) in hepatic triglyceride content, a 73% increase in diacylglycerol content (P < 0.01), and a 66% increase in PKCε translocation (P < 0.05). Hepatic insulin resistance was prevented with administration of CRMP by reversal of hepatic steatosis and prevention of hepatic diacylglycerol accumulation and PKCε activation.These findings are consistent with excess adipose glucocorticoid activity being a predisposing factor for the development of lipid (diacylglycerol-PKCε)-induced hepatic insulin resistance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Changes in the environment, behavior, diet, and lifestyle during the last decades are considered the major causes. A Western diet, which is rich in saturated fat and simple sugars, may lead to changes in gut microbial composition and physiology, which have recently been linked to the development of metabolic diseases.We will discuss evidence that demonstrates the influence of the small and large intestinal microbiota on weight regulation and the development of insulin resistance, based on literature search.Altered large intestinal microbial composition may promote obesity by increasing energy harvest through specialized gut microbes. In both large and small intestine, microbial alterations may increase gut permeability that facilitates the translocation of whole bacteria or endotoxic bacterial components into metabolic active tissues. Moreover, changed microbial communities may affect the production of satiety-inducing signals. Finally, bacterial metabolic products, such as short chain  acids (SCFAs) and their relative ratios, may be causal in disturbed immune and metabolic signaling, notably in the small intestine where the surface is large. The function of these organs (adipose tissue, brain, , muscle, pancreas) may be disturbed by the induction of low-grade inflammation, contributing to insulin resistance.Interventions aimed to restoring gut microbial homeostasis, such as ingestion of specific fibers or therapeutic microbes, are promising strategies to reduce insulin resistance and the related metabolic abnormalities in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.

Therefore, moderated milk replacer restriction during the artificial rearing period might negatively affect feed efficiency during the postweaning phases in dairy ewes. The aim of this work was to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes by RNA sequencing and differentially accumulated proteins using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the  of artificially reared Assaf lambs to identify modified metabolic pathways as a consequence of milk replacer restriction in order to find possible solutions to correct any detrimental effect caused by this factor. Forty female Assaf lambs were used in this experiment. The animals were penned individually and assigned randomly to 1 of 2 treatments groups (n = 20 per treatment). The first group of lambs was fed ad libitum (AL), whereas the second (restricted, RES) only received approximately 62.5% of the level of intake measured in the AL group. Eight 35-d-old lambs from each group (16 lambs in total) were harvested and a piece of  of 8 lambs (4 AL and 4 RES lambs) was excised for transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Differential gene expression analysis identified 386 DE genes [198 of them being annotated genes in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway], with 176 downregulated and 210 upregulated in the early feed-restricted group relative to the AL group. A total of 26 spots were also differentially accumulated proteins in the  of the 2 groups of lambs, 10 of them being down-accumulated whereas the other 16 evolved in the opposite way in the  of RES relative to AL lambs. Collectively, both the transcriptomic and proteomic approaches revealed an upregulation of genes participating in oxidation of  acids in the early feed-restricted lambs. The expression of many genes involved in the degradation of several AA (e.g. alanine, valine, isoleucine, ) was also modified in the RES lambs, probably to render substrates for gluconeogenesis. Moreover, other genes involved in apoptosis, inflammation, or hepatic oxidative pathways were upregulated in these lambs. Finally, the expression of genes implicated in oxidative phosphorylation was modified in RES animals. Altogether all these modifications suggest that the partitioning and utilization of nutrients in the early feed-restricted lambs might have been modified, being partially responsible for changes during the replacement phase later in life.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus is a scombroid fish highly appreciated as seafood worldwide. Being a top pelagic predator, concerns have been raised over human health risks due to its consumption. Therefore, herein it was comprehensively evaluated the health status and potential metabolite shifts between sexes of bluefin tuna from the Mediterranean Sea, proved to bioaccumulate environmental obesogens, namely polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) at hepatic level. To this aim, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics was applied on  of post-spawning tuna. Findings from this study pointed out that hepatic bioaccumulation of PCBs and OCPs induced differential metabolic disturbances between sexes, attributable to the reproductive stage at which tuna were caught. Alterations were mainly found in energy-producing metabolic pathways (with changes in acetate, acetoacetate, malonate, and lactate), amino acid (with changes in BCAA, alanine, sarcosine, and ), and lipid (with changes in choline and phosphocholine) metabolism, with activation of  acids biosynthesis and ketogenesis in male tuna. Overall, according to the current European legislation on maximum levels of contaminants in seafood, the consumption of bluefin tuna does not represent a risk for human health.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

MERTK is expressed by immune and non-immune cells involved in inflammation, metabolism and vascular homeostasis. We assessed the impact of MERTK rs4374383 G > A variant on nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) incidence and severity and on glucose and lipid metabolism. We followed-up 305 healthy nonobese nondiabetic, metabolic syndrome-free insulin sensitive participants in a population-based study, characterized for MERTK G > A polymorphism, adipokine profile and inflammatory markers.An independent cohort of 69 biopsy-proven nondiabetic NAFLD patients and 69 healthy controls underwent indirect calorimetry, an OGTT with Minimal Model analysis of glucose homeostasis, and an oral fat tolerance test with measurement of plasma lipoproteins, adipokines, MCP-1, and of Nuclear Factor (NF)-κB activation in circulating mononuclear cells (MNCs). In the longitudinal cohort, MERTK G > A polymorphism protected against 9-year incident NAFLD (OR:0.48,95%CI:0.26-0.79) and diabetes (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.19-0.87).In the cross-sectional cohort, MERTK A-allele carriers had higher fat oxidation rates and tissue insulin sensitivity. Despite comparable fastign and postprandial lipid profiles, MERTK A-allele carriers showed lower resistin and MCP-1 responses, milder MNC NF-κB activation, and a higher postprandial adiponectin response to fat, which predicted tissue insulin resistance hepatocyte apoptosis and  histology. MERTK G > A variant affects  disease, nutrient oxidation and glucose metabolism in NAFLD. The modulation of adipokine, chemokine and pro-inflammatory MNC activation in response to fat ingestion may contribute to the observed effects on  and metabolic disease.© The Author 2017.

Significant increases in oral glucose tolerance-tested (OGTT), insulin tolerance-tested, and non-fasting blood glucose levels were observed in mice on a HFD, as well as the significant increases in OGTT and non-fasting plasma insulin levels. Mice on a HFD had decreased plasma adiponectin levels and increased free  acid (FFA) levels. Supplementary SeMet significantly augmented OGTT blood glucose levels in mice on a HFD and plasma FFA levels in mice on a normal diet. The mRNA levels of six selenoproteins were measured, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) 1 and selenoprotein P (SelP) were selected as candidates that may be associated with insulin resistance or oxidative stress in the . Hepatic GPx1 expression was elevated in mice on a HFD and SeMet supplementation, and SelP expression increased in mice on a HFD. Histopathological observations in hepatic tissues showed hypertrophy of parenchymal cells and significant expression of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal in mice on a HFD, indicating lipid accumulation and oxidative stress induction. Hepatic protein  phosphatase activity also increased by a HFD.

Global double knockout of FXR and SHP signaling (DKO) causes severe cholestasis and  injury at early ages. Here, we report an unexpected beneficial impact on glucose and  acid metabolism in aged DKO mice, which show suppressed body weight gain and adiposity when maintained on normal chow. This phenotype was not observed in single Fxr or Shp knockouts. -specific Fxr/Shp double knockout mice fully phenocopied the DKO mice, with lower hepatic triglyceride accumulation, improved glucose/insulin tolerance, and accelerated  acid use.

We studied the impact of reduced TH in brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation. In adult heterozygous ( ) mice, dopamine and noradrenaline (NA) content in BAT decreased after cold exposure. This reduced catecholaminergic response did not impair cold adaptation, because these mice induced uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) and maintained BAT temperature to a similar extent than controls ( ). Possible compensatory mechanisms implicated were studied.  and  expression, key genes in BAT activation, were elevated in  mice at thermoneutrality from day 18.5 of embryonic life. Likewise, plasma FGF21 and   mRNA were increased. Analysis of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a process that triggers elevations in FGF21, showed higher phospho-IRE1, phospho-JNK, and CHOP in BAT of  mice at thermoneutrality. Also, increased lipolysis in BAT of cold-exposure  mice was demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), as well as diacylglycerol (DAG) and FFA content. Overall, these results indicate that the mild effects of  haploinsufficiency on BAT function are likely due to compensatory mechanisms involving elevations in  and  and through adaptive changes in the lipid profile.Copyright © 2018 Vázquez et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27233965>The Ron Receptor  Kinase Regulates Macrophage Heterogeneity and Plays a Protective Role in Diet-Induced Obesity, Atherosclerosis, and Hepatosteatosis.</a></h1><p>Obesity is a chronic inflammatory disease mediated in large part by the activation of inflammatory macrophages. This chronic inflammation underlies a whole host of diseases including atherosclerosis, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cancer, among others. Macrophages are generally classified as either inflammatory or alternatively activated. Some tissue-resident macrophages are derived from yolk sac erythromyeloid progenitors and fetal  progenitors that seed tissues during embryogenesis and have the ability to repopulate through local proliferation. These macrophages tend to be anti-inflammatory in nature and are generally involved in tissue remodeling, repair, and homeostasis. Alternatively, during chronic inflammation induced by obesity, bone marrow monocyte-derived macrophages are recruited to inflamed tissues, where they produce proinflammatory cytokines and exacerbate inflammation. The extent to which these two populations of macrophages are plastic in their phenotype remains controversial. We have demonstrated previously that the Ron receptor  kinase is expressed on tissue-resident macrophages, where it limits inflammatory macrophage activation and promotes a repair phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that Ron is expressed in a subpopulation of macrophages during chronic inflammation induced by obesity that exhibit a repair phenotype as determined by the expression of arginase 1. In addition, we demonstrate that the Ron receptor plays a protective role in the progression of diet-induced obesity, hepatosteatosis, and atherosclerosis. These results suggest that altering macrophage heterogeneity in vivo could have the potential to alleviate obesity-associated diseases.Copyright © 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078545>Histological evaluation of nintedanib in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis mice.</a></h1><p>In addition to potentially progressing to either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is currently the leading indication for  transplantation. Nintedanib has been clinically used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for many years, but its effects in an animal model of NASH have not been tested. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nintendanib on NASH in choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD)-fed mice.Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a CDAHFD for 6 weeks to induce NASH with  fibrosis, and they were administered nintedanib (60 mg/kg/day) or distilled water orally in the last 2 weeks of the feeding period. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), triglyceride, and non-esterified  acids concentrations were measured. Serum cytokeratin 18 fragment (CK18) was detected using ELISA.  tissue sections from mice were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome to assess the level of steatohepatitis and fibrosis.CDAHFD-fed mice exhibited higher serum ALT, AST, and ALP levels compared with Control mice. A significant increase in the serum CK18 level was observed in the NASH group compared with the Control group. CDAHFD feeding also enhanced steatohepatitis and hepatic fibrosis pathological features, which were reduced after nintedanib treatment.Nintedanib exerted anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in CDAHFD-induced NASH mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to investigate clinical, genetic, metabolic and lifestyle characteristics in lean Caucasian subjects with NAFLD.Data from 187 subjects allocated to one of the three groups according to body mass index (BMI) and hepatic steatosis on ultrasound were obtained: lean healthy (BMI≤25 kg/m, no steatosis, N=71), lean NAFLD (BMI≤25 kg/m, steatosis, N=55), obese NAFLD (BMI≥30 kg/m, steatosis; N=61).

In vascular smooth muscle cells LRP1 controls reverse cholesterol transport through platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFR-β) trafficking and  kinase activity. Here we show that LRP1 regulates hepatic energy homeostasis by integrating insulin signaling with lipid uptake and secretion. Somatic inactivation of LRP1 in the  (hLRP1KO) predisposes to diet-induced insulin resistance with dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis. On a high-fat diet, hLRP1KO mice develop a severe Metabolic Syndrome secondary to hepatic insulin resistance, reduced expression of insulin receptors on the hepatocyte surface and decreased glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) translocation. While LRP1 is also required for efficient cell surface insulin receptor expression in the absence of exogenous lipids, this latent state of insulin resistance is unmasked by exposure to  acids. This further impairs insulin receptor trafficking and results in increased hepatic lipogenesis, impaired  acid oxidation and reduced very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride secretion.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Hepatic STAT5 deficiency accelerates  tumourigenesis in presence of high GH levels. To determine whether the upstream kinase JAK2 exerts similar functions, we crossed mice harbouring a hepatocyte-specific deletion of JAK2 (JAK2) to GH transgenic mice (GH) and compared them to GHSTAT5 mice. Similar to GHSTAT5 mice, JAK2 deficiency resulted in severe steatosis in the GH background. However, in contrast to STAT5 deficiency, loss of JAK2 significantly delayed  tumourigenesis. This was attributed to: (i) activation of STAT3 in STAT5-deficient mice, which was prevented by JAK2 deficiency and (ii) increased detoxification capacity of JAK2-deficient livers, which diminished oxidative damage as compared to GHSTAT5 mice, despite equally severe steatosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The reduced oxidative damage in JAK2-deficient livers was linked to increased expression and activity of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Consistent with genetic deletion of Jak2, pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Jak2 led to significant upregulation of Gst isoforms and to reduced hepatic oxidative DNA damage. Therefore, blocking JAK2 function increases detoxifying GSTs in hepatocytes and protects against oxidative  damage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26858195>Amino Acid Metabolism is Altered in Adolescents with Nonalcoholic  Disease-An Untargeted, High Resolution Metabolomics Study.</a></h1><p>To conduct an untargeted, high resolution exploration of metabolic pathways that was altered in association with hepatic steatosis in adolescents.This prospective, case-control study included 39 Hispanic-American, obese adolescents aged 11-17 years evaluated for hepatic steatosis using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Of these 39 individuals, 30 had hepatic steatosis ≥5% and 9 were matched controls with hepatic steatosis <5%. Fasting plasma samples were analyzed in triplicate using ultra-high resolution metabolomics on a Thermo Fisher Q Exactive mass spectrometry system, coupled with C18 reverse phase liquid chromatography. Differences in plasma metabolites between adolescents with and without nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) were determined by independent t tests and visualized using Manhattan plots. Untargeted pathway analyses using Mummichog were performed among the significant metabolites to identify pathways that were most dysregulated in NAFLD.The metabolomics analysis yielded 9583 metabolites, and 7711 with 80% presence across all samples remained for statistical testing. Of these, 478 metabolites were associated with the presence of NAFLD compared with the matched controls. Pathway analysis revealed that along with lipid metabolism, several major amino acid pathways were dysregulated in NAFLD, with  metabolism being the most affected.Metabolic pathways of several amino acids are significantly disturbed in adolescents with elevated hepatic steatosis. This is a novel finding and suggests that these pathways may be integral in the mechanisms of NAFLD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Much of this interest stems from animal and human studies which suggest that an increased intake of fermentable fibre can suppress appetite and improve weight management. A growing number of reports have demonstrated that the principal products of colonic fermentation of dietary fibre, SCFA, contribute to energy homeostasis via effects on multiple cellular metabolic pathways and receptor-mediated mechanisms. In particular, over the past decade it has been identified that a widespread receptor system exists for SCFA. These G-protein-coupled receptors, free  acid receptor (FFAR) 2 and FFAR3 are expressed in numerous tissue sites, including the gut epithelium and adipose tissue. Investigations using FFAR2- or FFAR3-deficient animal models suggest that SCFA-mediated stimulation of these receptors enhances the release of the anorectic hormones peptide   and glucagon-like peptide-1 from colonic L cells and leptin from adipocytes. In addition, the SCFA acetate has recently been shown to have a direct role in central appetite regulation. Furthermore, the SCFA propionate is a known precursor for hepatic glucose production, which has been reported to suppress feeding behaviour in ruminant studies through the stimulation of hepatic vagal afferents. The present review therefore proposes that an elevated colonic production of SCFA could stimulate numerous hormonal and neural signals at different organ and tissue sites that would cumulatively suppress short-term appetite and energy intake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30724772> X receptor agonist T0901317 inhibits the migration and invasion of non-small-cell lung cancer cells in vivo and in vitro.</a></h1><p> X receptors are recognized as important regulators of cholesterol,  acid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and glucose homeostasis.

As a demonstration of this approach, we design and evaluate a direct chemosensor for protein  phosphatase-1B (PTP1B), an established signaling node in human disease. The optimal sensor design is capable of detecting as little as 6 pM (12 pg) full-length recombinant PTP1B and is remarkably selective for PTP1B among a panel of highly homologous  phosphatases. Coupling this robust activity probe with the specificity of antibodies allowed for the temporal analysis of endogenous PTP1B activity dynamics in lysates generated from HepG2 cells after stimulation with insulin. Lastly, we leveraged this assay format to profile PTP1B activity perturbations in a rat model of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD), providing direct evidence for elevated PTP1B catalytic activity in this disease state.

While three different  acid binding proteins (FABP3, -5, and -7) serve this function in brain, relatively little is known about how such hydrophobic ECs and cannabinoids are transported within the . The most prominent hepatic FABP,   acid binding protein (FABP1 or L-FABP), has high affinity for arachidonic acid (ARA) and ARA-CoA, suggesting that FABP1 may also bind ARA-derived ECs (AEA and 2-AG). Indeed, FABP1 bound ECs with high affinity as shown by displacement of FABP1-bound fluorescent ligands and by quenching of FABP1 intrinsic  fluorescence. FABP1 also had high affinity for most non-ARA-containing ECs, FABP1 inhibitors, EC uptake/hydrolysis inhibitors, and phytocannabinoids and less so for synthetic cannabinoid receptor (CBR) agonists and antagonists. The physiological impact was examined with  from wild-type (WT) versus FABP1 gene-ablated (LKO) male mice. As shown by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, FABP1 gene ablation significantly increased hepatic levels of AEA, 2-AG, and 2-OG. These increases were not due to increased protein levels of EC synthetic enzymes (NAPEPLD and DAGL) or a decreased level of EC degradative enzyme (FAAH) but correlated with complete loss of FABP1, a decreased level of SCP2 (8-fold less prevalent than FABP1, but also binds ECs), and a decreased level of degradative enzymes (NAAA and MAGL).

In this experiment, we added 40 and 400 mg/kg GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens to clarify the maternal effects of GEN on the development and metabolism of chick embryos. GEN treatment at 40 mg/kg increased embryonic length, weight, and  index, as well as the width of the proliferative zone in the tibial growth plate of chick embryos. Gene ontology (GO) cluster analysis of the hepatic transcriptome showed that GEN treatment promoted embryonic development and cell proliferation. Low-dose GEN treatment increased insulin growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)3 mRNA expression in the embryonic , whereas high-dose GEN treatment increased IGFBP5 expression and activated the apoptosis and protein  kinase signaling pathways. Furthermore, adding supplemental GEN to the diet of hens promoted the glycolysis process in the embryonic  through the insulin-signaling pathway, upregulated target genes (phosphoglucomutase-2, hexokinase 1, dihydroxyacetone phosphate by aldolase, phosphofructokinase, platelet, and enolase 2), and enhanced the transport of carboxylic acids and cholesterol and the synthesis of unsaturated  acid (arachidonic acid) in the embryonic  through upregulation of  X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and patatin-like phospholipase A. Additionally, GEN treatment increased  acid β-oxidation and Na/K-ATPase activity in the embryonic  through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; PPARα and PPARδ) and the AMPK signaling pathway, which could provide energy for embryonic development. In addition, GEN treatment in hens increased superoxide dismutase activity and metallothionein expression in the chick embryonic  and promoted lymphocyte proliferation through upregulation of mRNA expression of CDKN1A, IL12RB1, Sox11, PRKAR1A, PRKCQ, and TCF3. The improved immunity and antioxidant capacity, as a result of maternal GEN effects, was conducive to embryonic development. In summary, the addition of GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens significantly promoted the development and metabolism of chick embryos.-Lv, Z., Fan, H., Zhang, B., Ning, C., Xing, K., Guo, Y.

Blood was collected at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12 to measure serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. At week 12, both the pancreas and the  were isolated for further histological and biochemical analysis. Hepatic and plasma  acid composition was assessed by gas chromatography. Expression of mRNA of major enzymes involved in saturated/unsaturated  acid synthesis was analyzed by qPCR. In separate experiments serum enzyme activities and insulin levels were measured at week 9.At week 12, rats fed with 2% cholesterol +0.25% cholate-supplemented diet were characterized by elevated serum cholesterol (4.09 ± 0.20 vs. 2.89 ± 0.22 mmol/L, *p < 0.05) while triglyceride (2.27 ± 0.05 vs. 2.03 ± 0.03 mmol/L) and glucose levels (5.32 ± 0.14 vs. 5.23 ± 0.10 mmol/L) remained unchanged. Isolated hypercholesterolemia increased hepatic lipid accumulation, hepatic cholesterol (5.86 ± 0.22 vs. 1.60 ± 0.15 ng/g tissue, *p < 0.05) and triglyceride contents (19.28 ± 1.42 vs. 6.78 ± 0.71 ng/g tissue, *p < 0.05), and hepatic nitrotyrosine level (4.07 ± 0.52 vs. 2.59 ± 0.31 ng/mg protein, *p < 0.05). The histology and tissue lipid content of the pancreas was not affected. Serum total protein level, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities remained unchanged in response to isolated hypercholesterolemia while serum alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) significantly increased. Plasma insulin levels did not change in response to isolated hypercholesterolemia suggesting an intact endocrine function of the pancreas. Isolated hypercholesterolemia caused a significantly increased hepatic and serum  acid level associated with a marked alteration of  acid composition. Hepatic expression of Δ9-desaturase (SCD1) was increased 4.92×, while expression of Δ5-desaturase and Δ6-desaturase were decreased (0.447× and 0.577×, respectively) due to isolated hypercholesterolemia.Isolated hypercholesterolemia leads to hepatic steatosis and marked alterations in the hepatic lipid profile without affecting the pancreas. Altered  acid profile might mediate harmful effects of cholesterol in the .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27282405>Deletion of Gab2 in mice protects against hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis: a novel therapeutic target for  disease.</a></h1><p> disease is a serious health problem worldwide and is the most common cause for chronic  disease and metabolic disorders. The major challenge in the prevention and intervention of this disease is the incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanism and thus lack of potent therapeutic targets due to multifaceted and interdependent disease factors. In this study, we investigated the role of a signaling adaptor protein, GRB2-associated-binding protein 2 (Gab2), in  using an animal disease model. Gab2 expression in hepatocytes responded to various disease factor stimulations, and Gab2 knockout mice exhibited resistance to fat-induced obesity, fat- or alcohol-stimulated hepatic steatosis, as well as methionine and choline deficiency-induced steatohepatitis. Concordantly, the forced expression or knockdown of Gab2 enhanced or diminished oleic acid (OA)- or ethanol-induced lipid production in hepatocytes in vitro, respectively. During lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, both fat and alcohol induced the recruitment of PI3K or Socs3 by Gab2 and the activation of their downstream signaling proteins AKT, ERK, and Stat3. Therefore, Gab2 may be a disease-associated protein that is induced by pathogenic factors to amplify and coordinate multifactor-induced signals to govern disease development in the . Our research provides a novel potential target for the prevention and intervention of  disease.© The Author (2016).

After the hyperlipidemic model was established, mice were randomly divided into six groups, as follows: normal control group (NC), hyperlipidemic control group (HC), positive control group (7 mg kg d simvastatin) (PC) and LM groups (50, 100 and 200 mg kg d denoted as LM-50, LM-100 and LM-200, respectively). Subsequently, the body weight, organ indices, lipid metabolism, antioxidant properties and -kidney functions of the mice were examined. Moreover, the activities of lipoprotein metabolism enzymes in serum and  tissue were examined to study the feasible mechanism. The results imply that LM could effectively reduce body weight, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and atherogenic index (AI), and increase high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Moreover, treatment with LM also increased the antioxidant enzymes activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content relative to the HC group. In addition, the  and kidney damage indices such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine (CRE), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid were lowered. LM administration also significantly corrected disturbances of -kidney functions with no  deposits in the , resulting in a protective effect against renal histological alteration. The hypolipidemic effect occurred partly due to the regulation of hepatic lipase (HL) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in serum and  to markedly decrease TG. This confirms the important role of LM in the prevention of hyperlipidemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26058503>Metabolite profiling in plasma and tissues of ob/ob and db/db mice identifies novel markers of obesity and type 2 diabetes.</a></h1><p>Metabolomics approaches in humans have identified around 40 plasma metabolites associated with insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes, which often coincide with those for obesity. We aimed to separate diabetes-associated from obesity-associated metabolite alterations in plasma and study the impact of metabolically important tissues on plasma metabolite concentrations.Two obese mouse models were studied; one exclusively with obesity (ob/ob) and another with type 2 diabetes (db/db). Both models have impaired leptin signalling as a cause for obesity, but the different genetic backgrounds determine the susceptibility to diabetes. In these mice, we profiled plasma, , skeletal muscle and adipose tissue via semi-quantitative GC-MS and quantitative liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS for a wide range of metabolites.Metabolite profiling identified 24 metabolites specifically associated with diabetes but not with obesity. Among these are known markers such as 1,5-anhydro-D-sorbitol, 3-hydroxybutyrate and the recently reported marker glyoxylate. New metabolites in the diabetic model were lysine, O-phosphotyrosine and branched-chain  acids. We also identified 33 metabolites that were similarly altered in both models, represented by branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) as well as glycine, serine, trans-4-hydroxyproline, and various lipid species and derivatives. Correlation analyses showed stronger associations for plasma amino acids with adipose tissue metabolites in db/db mice compared with ob/ob mice, suggesting a prominent contribution of adipose tissue to changes in plasma in a diabetic state.By studying mice with metabolite signatures that resemble obesity and diabetes in humans, we have found new metabolite entities for validation in appropriate human cohorts and revealed their possible tissue of origin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28578349>PTPRO Promotes Oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein Induced Oxidative Stress and Cell Apoptosis through Toll-Like Receptor 4/Nuclear Factor κB Pathway.</a></h1><p>Critical roles of phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) have been implicated in inflammation. However, little is known about their functional effects on atherosclerosis (AS). We aim to study their potential function in AS.An oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) induced AS model constructed with PTPRO over-expressing RAW264.7 cells and PTPRO knockout macrophages. Cell apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry and  accumulation was evaluated by oil red staining. The production of ROS (reactive oxygen species), SOD (superoxide dismutase), MDA (malondialdehyde), TC (Triglyceride), and TG (total cholesterol) was evaluated. Western blot was performed to detect the expression of CD36, TLR4 and nuclear factor kB (NF-κB).PTPRO expression was promoted in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner following ox-LDL challenging. In PTPRO-over-expressing cells, CD36 expression and the level of oil-red staining, TC and TG were increased; ROS production, MDA and level of cell apoptosis were improved, but SOD was reduced. However, in PTPRO knockout cells opposite results were found. TLR4 and NF-κB/p65 phosphorylation was significantly enhanced in PTPRO over-expressing cells, while significantly down-regulated in PTPRO knockout cells.PTPRO plays ital roles in AS via promoting ox-LDL induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis through TLR4/NF-κB pathway.© 2017 The Author(s).
