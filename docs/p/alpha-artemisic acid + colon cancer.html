While many techniques have been developed to characterize antigen-antibody interactions, one strategy that has gained considerable momentum over the last decade for the identification and quantification of antigen-antibody interactions, is immune affinity-chromatography followed by mass spectrometry. Moreover, the combination of enzymatic digestion of antigens and mass spectrometric identification of specific binding peptide(s) to the corresponding anti-antigen antibody has become a versatile and clinical relevant method for mapping epitopes by mass spectrometry. In this chapter, the development and applications of novel immunoaffinity mass spectrometric methodologies for elucidating biomedical aspects will be presented. First, a simplified mass spectrometric approach that maps an epitope from a digested antigen solution without immobilizing the anti-antigen antibody on a solid support will be reported. iMALDI (from immunoaffinity and MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization), a technique that involves immunoaffinity capture of specific peptides and direct MALDI measurements was used for absolute quantification of serine/threonine-specific protein kinase (AKT) peptides from breast  and  cell lines and flash-frozen tumor lysates. The intact transition epitope mapping (ITEM) was shown as a rapid and accurate epitope mapping method by using Ion mobility mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) for analysing the antigen peptide-containing immune complex previously generated by in solution epitope extraction/excision procedures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592205>Dietary intake of probiotic kimchi ameliorated IL-6-driven  cachexia.</a></h2><p> cachexia is a syndrome accompanying weight loss, skeletal muscle atrophy, and loss of adipose tissue in patients with advanced . Since interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of core mediators causing  cachexia and kimchi can modulate IL-6 response, we hypothesized dietary intake of kimchi can ameliorate  cachexia. In this study, we studied preemptive administration of kimchi can ameliorate mouse  carcinoma cells  (C26) adenocarcinoma-induced  cachexia and explored anti-cachexic mechanisms of kimchi focused on the changes of muscle atrophy, cachexic inflammation, and catabolic catastrophe. As results, dietary intake of kimchi significantly attenuated the development of  cachexia, presented with lesser weight loss, higher muscle preservation as well as higher survival from  cachexia in mice. Starting from significant inhibition of IL-6 and its signaling, kimchi afforded significant inhibition of muscle specific ubiquitin-proteasome system including inhibition of atrogin-1 and muscle ring finger protein-1 (MuRF-1) with other muscle related genes including mitofusin-2 (Mfn-2) and PGC-1α. Significant inhibition of lipolysis gene such as adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive ligase (HSL) accompanied with significant induction of fatty  synthase (FAS) and sterol response element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) was achieved with kimchi. As gene regulation, IL-6 and their receptor as well as Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were significantly attenuated with kimchi. In conclusion, dietary intake of  preventive kimchi can be an anticipating option to ameliorate  cachexia via suppressive action of IL-6 accompanied with decreased muscle atrophy and lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 JCBNCopyright © 2019 JCBN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31018491>Anthocyanin Encapsulated by Ferulic -Grafted-Maltodextrin (FA-g-MD) Microcapsules Potentially Improved its Free Radical Scavenging Capabilities Against HO-Induced Oxidative Stress.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the antioxidant activity and release behavior of anthocyanin (ANC) loaded within FA-g-MD wall (ANC-FA-g-MD microcapsule) in vitro. The microencapsulation of ANC was prepared by spray drying and displayed a biphasic release profile. The combination of ANC and FA-g-MD (0.0625-1 mg/mL) showed a higher antioxidant activity than that of both individuals. A possible intermolecular interaction between ANC and FA-g-MD was studied by UV-vis spectra. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test, and protein expression of quinone oxidoreductase 1(NQO1), glutathione reductase (GSR) and γ-glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (γ-GCLC) were measured through human  cells (HT-29). After a 24-hour incubation of the HT-29, the combinations (0-60 μg/mL) exhibited a high potential to diminish the ROS level. And the distinct upregulated expressions of GCLC and NQO1 of HT-29 were detected after treatment with combinations compared to those of single ones. These results suggested that the ANC-FA-g-MD microcapsules exerts enhanced antioxidant effect with capability of the modulation of GCLC and NQO1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545039>Extra Virgin Olive Oil Minor Compounds Modulate Mitogenic Action of Oleic  on  Cell Line.</a></h2><p>Experimental and clinical findings suggest that olive oil has a protective effect, whereas oleic  consumption induces colorectal  (CRC). Considering this apparent contradiction and that olive oil is a complex mix of fatty , mainly oleic  and minor compounds such as phenolic compounds, lignans, hydrocarbons, and triterpenes, we study its effects on intestinal epithelial cell growth. Our results show that oleic  (1-100 μM) but not elaidic  induced DNA synthesis and Caco-2 cell growth (2-fold higher than cells without growth factors,  < 0.05). These effects were inhibited by 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors as well as the leukotriene antagonist ( < 0.05), suggesting the implication of this pathway in this mitogenic action. Hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein, pinoresinol, squalene, and maslinic  (0.1-10 μM) reverted DNA synthesis and Caco-2 cell growth induced by oleic . These effects were not the consequence of the cell cycle arrest or the impairment of cell viability with the exception of hydroxytyrosol and maslinic  that induced cell detachment and apoptosis (35.6 ± 2.3 and 43.2 ± 2.4%, respectively) at the higher concentration assayed. Oleuropein effects can be related with hydroxytyrosol release as a consequence of oleuropein hydrolysis by Caco-2 cells (up to 25%). Furthermore, hydroxytyrosol modulates the arachidonic  cascade, and this event can be associated with its antimitogenic action. In conclusion, oleic  and oleic  in the presence of olive oil representative minor components have opposite effects, suggesting that the consumption of seed oils, high oleic  seed oils, or olive oil will probably have different effects on CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608143>Metastatic appendiceal  treated with Yttrium 90 radioembolization and systemic chemotherapy: A case report.</a></h2><p>Primary appendiceal cancers are rare, and they generally present with liver and/or peritoneal metastases.

A Computed Tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed acute appendicitis and contained perforation. Urgent laparoscopic appendectomy was then followed by histological analysis, which was significant for appendiceal adenocarcinoma. After complete workup he underwent right hemicolectomy and lymph node dissection. He received adjuvant chemotherapy as the local lymph nodes were positive. Follow-up imaging was significant for liver metastasis. Due to rapid growth of the liver lesions and new peritoneal nodules, the patient was treated with a combination of Y-90 RE and folinic , fluorouracil, and irinotecan with bevacizumab and not microwave ablation as previously planned. Follow up imaging demonstrated complete response of the liver lesions.

This is due to the presence of oxygen during synthesis which oxidizes Cu(0) to Cu(II) and also produces the free hydroxyl radical. The authors have prepared DNA-CuNPs with enhanced temporal stability of fluorescence by optimizing the reaction conditions so as to minimize the deleterious effects of oxygen. The operational lifetime of DNA-CuNPs was increased from 25 min to 200 min. Fluorescence spectra of DNA-CuNPs in optimized condition show an emission peak at 650 nm when excited at 340 nm. DNA-CuNPs synthesized in this manner were used for cell imaging. As a proof of concept, the nucleus of a human  cell line (HCT116) was stained. The method does not involve any chemicals other that copper sulfate and ascorbate. This new approach for generating DNA-CuNPs improves imaging of biological processes and provides a basis for developing other types of DNA-templated nanomaterials.

Several analogues exhibited broad-spectrum cytotoxic activities over all nine tumor types represented in the panel, with more potent antiproliferative activities observed against selected  cell lines, including multidrug-resistant phenotypes. Among them, compound  showed GI (50% growth inhibition) values ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 μM against 26 different tumor cell lines and selectivity for one  (COLO 205) and two melanoma (SK-MEL-5 and UACC-257) cell lines at the TGI (total growth inhibition) level.

In this study, we aim to investigate lysophospholipid levels in colorectal  tissues to identify lysophospholipids, the levels of which change specifically in colorectal cancers. We used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to measure lysophospholipid levels in cancerous and normal tissues from 11 surgical specimens of sigmoid  cancers, since recent advances in this field have improved detection sensitivities for lysophospholipids. Our results indicate that, in  tissues, levels of lysophosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidylserine were significantly higher ( p = 0.025 and p = 0.01, respectively), whereas levels of lysophosphatidic  were significantly lower ( p = 0.0019) than in normal tissues. Although levels of lysophosphatidylglycerol were higher in  tissues than in normal tissues, this difference was not found to be significant ( p = 0.11). Fatty  analysis further showed that 18:0 lysophosphatidylinositol and 18:0 lysophosphatidylserine were the predominant species of lysophospholipids in  tissues.

In current study, we investigated potential use of silica based supports; 3D cage type SiSBA-16 (S-16), monodispersed hydrophilic spherical silica (HYPS) and mesocellular foam (MSU-F) for cisplatin (Cp) delivery. To obtain magnetic resonance characteristics, 10 wt% iron oxide was loaded through enforced adsorption technique. For pH stimuli responsive release of Cp, 10 wt%SPIONs/S-16 was functionalized with 3-(Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (A) and poly acrylic  (PAA) termed as 10 wt%SPIONs/S-16-A-Cp and 10 wt%SPIONs/S-16-APAA-Cp. By TEM analysis, the average diameter of the SPIONs was found to range between 10-60 nm. VSM analysis showed saturation magnetization over S-16, HYPS and MSU-F were in the following order: 10 wt%SPIONs/HYPS (4.08 emug) > 10 wt%SPIONs /S-16 (2.39 emug) > 10 wt%SPIONs/MSU-F (0.23 emug). Cp release study using dialysis membrane in PBS solution over 10 wt%SPIONs/S-16 nanoformulations showed highest cumulative release (65%) than 10 wt%SPIONs/MSU-F-A-Cp (63%), 10 wt%SPIONs/HYPS-A-Cp (58%), and Cp-F127/S-16 (53%), respectively. 10 wt%SPIONs/S-16-A-Cp and 10 wt%SPIONs/S-16-APAA-Cp were evaluated for in vitro target anticancer efficiency in human  cell lines ( (HCT 116), cervical  (HeLa)) and normal cells (Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) using MTT and DAPI staining. 10 wt%SPIONs/S-16-A-Cp treated Hela and HCT116 cancerous cell lines showed significant control of cell growth, apoptotic activity and less cytotoxic effect as compared to Cp and 10 wt%SPIONs/S-16.

This immunosensing platform (ethanolamine/anti-ET-1/11-MUA/Au) was characterized via atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle (CA) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic techniques. The fabricated SPR electrode was further used to detect ET-1 in the broad concentration range 2-100 pg mL, with a detection limit of 0.30 pg mL and remarkable sensitivity of 2.18 m pgmL. The adsorption mechanism was studied using monophasic model and the values of association (k) and dissociation (k) constants for anti-ET-1 and ET-1 binding were calculated to be 4.4 ± 0.4 × 10 M s and 2.04 ± 0.0003 × 10 s, respectively. The results obtained via analysis of serum samples of colorectal  patients were found to be in good agreement with those obtained from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique.

CD44 is a relevant HA receptor in this context. However, HA is also a ligand for TLR4, a receptor of significance in CRC. In this study we examine the relative contribution of HA interactions with CD44 and TLR4 in  tumorigenesis. CRC models included ApcMin/+ mice, azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM-DSS) and CT26 tumor isografts. We used knockout mice and CT26 CRC cells with CRISPR knockdown of CD44 and TLR4. HA activity was modulated by PEP1 (a 12-mer peptide that blocks HA from binding its receptors), hyaluronidase (which promotes HA degradation), or 4-MU (HA synthesis inhibitor). Blockade of HA binding via PEP1 decreased growth in all CRC models and in cell culture. The effects were significant in WT and with CD44 deletion, but not with TLR4 deletion. In the AOM-DSS model, mice deficient in CD44 or TLR4 had fewer tumors. CD44 and TLR4 deficient CT26 isografts grew more slowly, exhibiting decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. In vitro, endogenous HA blocked LPS binding to TLR4 suggesting that HA is a relevant TLR4 ligand in . Finally, PEP1 enhanced tumor radiation sensitivity in the isograft model. Together these results indicate that HA binding to TLR4, as well as CD44, plays a key role in  tumorigenesis.

Samples were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. The data analyses focused on changes in bacterial community diversity. Linear regression was used to evaluate factors that predict a reduction in  PGE2.At baseline, increased bacterial diversity, as measured by the Shannon and Inverse Simpson indexes in both biopsy and luminal brushing samples, was positively correlated with dietary fiber intakes and negatively correlated with fat intakes. Dietary supplementation with ω-3 fatty  increased the Yue and Clayton community dis-similarity index between the microbiome in luminal brushings and  biopsy samples post-supplementation (P = 0.015). In addition, there was a small group of individuals with relatively high Prevotella abundance who were resistant to the anti-inflammatory effects of ω-3 fatty  supplementation. In linear regression analyses, increases in diversity of the bacteria in the luminal brushing samples, but not in the biopsy samples, were significant predictors of lower  PGE2 concentrations post-supplementation in models that included baseline PGE2, baseline body mass index, and changes in  eicosapentaenoic -to-arachidonic  ratios. The changes in bacterial diversity contributed to 6-8% of the interindividual variance in change in  PGE2 (P = 0.001).Dietary supplementation with ω-3 fatty  had little effect on intestinal bacteria in healthy humans; however, an increase in diversity in the luminal brushings significantly predicted reductions in  PGE2.

To explore the pharmacological activity and mechanism of Tet on  and its unique advantages as a natural product. In the present study, analyses of the cell cycle, apoptosis, targets prediction, molecular docking, and alterations in protein levels were performed to elucidate how Tet functions in . We found that Tet robustly induced arrest at the G1 phase in  cell line HT-29. It induced HT-29 cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, analysis of protein expression levels in HT-29 cells showed down-regulation of Bcl-2, pro-caspase 3, pro-caspase 8, PARP, cyclin D1 (CCND1), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK 4), and up-regulation of Bax, active caspase 3, and active caspase 8. These results indicate that Tet induces apoptosis of  cells through the mitochondrial pathway and caspase family pathway. Molecular docking showed interaction effects and binding energy. Comparing with the CDK4 inhibitors ribociclib and palbociclib, the docking energy is similar to the docked amino  residues. Therefore, we conclude that Tet and the CCND1/CDK4 compound could form hydrogen bonds and a stable compound structure, which can inhibit  cells proliferation by regulating CCND1/CDK4 compound and its downstream proteins phosphorylated Rb (p-Rb).

Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 could play a key role in cachexia. Moreover strong chemotherapy medications such as doxorubicin have complications such as toxicity and cachexia. Citrus unshiu Peel have been used as traditional herbal drugs for the treatment of  in traditional oriental medicine (TOM). Since its main components have anti-inflammatory effects, we evaluated the anti-cachexia activity in order to support the traditional usage of Citrus unshiu peel. Aim of the study; We aimed to assess the preventive or therapeutic effect of Citrus unshiu Peel Extract (CUPE) on cachexia by reducing of inflammatory cytokines in mice bearing C26 tumor. Also the contribution role of CUPE has evaluated on improvement of chemotherapy through reducing of inflammatory cytokines. Materials and Methods; The CUPE was prepared by Soxhlet extractor and quantitative and qualitative analysis of aqua extract was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). C26 tumor bearing BALB/c male mice were immunized with different formulation of oral Prophylactic-therapeutic CUPE and/or intraperitoneal doxorubicin and then were monitored for weight gain, food intake and tumor size throughout the study. On the 32nd day after tumor injection, inflammatory cytokines levels, IL6, TNF-α and IL-1β were evaluated by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Malondialdehyde- Thiobarbituric  (MDA) levels were measured by standard method. Results; Oral administration of CUPE in both prophylactic and therapeutic formulation to C26 adenocarcinoma bearing mice reduced the weight loss, tumor volume, and serum MDA levels compared with untreated tumor-bearing mice and Doxorubicin (Dox) groups. Also, the combination therapy of (CUPE + Dox) leads to reducing the levels of serum IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and tumor volume compared with untreated tumor-bearing mice and Dox groups. Serum MDA levels were considerably reduced by combination therapy of (CUPE + Dox) compared with Dox groups. Conclusions; These findings confirm the safety and efficacy of CUPE on C26 adenocarcinoma bearing mice as pure and adjuvant therapy, the results of which might be used in further human studies as a valuable natural anticancer agent alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Also the results showed that simultaneous application of CUPE and Dox leads to significant reduction of cachexia from the Dox chemotherapy.Copyright © 2019.

However, structural characterization and mechanistic insight of seaweed components responsible for their biological activities are lacking. We isolated cymopol and related natural products from the marine green alga Cymopolia barbata and demonstrated their function as activators of transcription factor Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response to increase the cellular antioxidant status. We probed the reactivity of the bioactivation product of cymopol, cymopol quinone, which was able to modify various cysteine residues of Nrf2's cytoplasmic repressor protein Keap1. The observed adducts are reflective of the polypharmacology at the level of natural product, due to multiple electrophilic centers, and at the amino  level of the cysteine-rich target protein Keap1. The non-polar C. barbata extract and its major active component cymopol, reduced inflammatory gene transcription in vitro in macrophages and mouse embryonic fibroblasts in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Cymopol-containing extracts attenuated neutrophil migration in a zebrafish tail wound model. RNA-seq analysis of  tissues of mice exposed to non-polar extract or cymopol showed an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory response, with more pronounced effects exhibited by the extract. Cymopolia extract reduced DSS-induced colitis as measured by fecal lipocalin concentration. RNA-seq showed that mucosal-associated bacterial composition and transcriptional profile in large intestines were beneficially altered to varying degrees in mice treated with either the extract or cymopol. We conclude that seaweed-derived compounds, especially cymopol, alter Nrf2-mediated host and microbial gene expression, thereby providing polypharmacological effects.Copyright © 2019.

Moreover, G2-treatment led to S and G2/M phase arrest in both cells, which could be elucidated by the change of mRNA levels of p21, p27 and Cyclin E and the increased protein level of p21. G2 also induced dramatically ROS accumulated and MMP decreased, which contributed to the apoptosis through activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways via changing the genes and proteins expression involved in apoptosis pathway in both of HepG2 and HCT116 cells. <p> Conclusion: These findings suggested that the apoptotis in both cell lines induced by G2 in both cell lines was related to both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31010232>Gelatin-Coated Microfluidic Channels for 3D Microtissue Formation: On-Chip Production and Characterization.</a></h2><p>Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture models are limited in their ability to reproduce human structures and functions.

In the present study, we combined EGFRvIII-targeted CAR-T cells with poly I:C treatment and evaluated the synergic antitumor effect  and in immunocompetent mice bearing subcutaneous  or orthotopic breast  xenografts. Poly I:C significantly promoted more IL-2 and IFN γ production as well as higher lytic activity of CAR-T cells. Upon systemic administration , CAR-T cells obviously suppressed tumor growth, and poly I:C significantly enhanced the suppression. Further study showed that poly I:C exerted antitumor effect dependent on type I IFNs. In addition, poly I:C decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) number in peripheral blood and spleen, and attenuated the immunosuppressive activity of MDSC on proliferation and cytolytic function of CAR-T. Depletion of MDSC with anti-Gr1 Ab further increased the antitumor effect of CAR-T cells plus poly I:C treatment.

These cells have a high rate of glutaminolysis and release ammonia (NH) as a byproduct, which may function as a diffusible signal among  cells and can reveal cellular heterogeneity. E7, a nematic liquid crystal (LC), is doped with 4-pentyl-4'-biphenyl carboxylic  (PBA) and encapsulated in polymeric microcapsules (P-E7), which are then immobilized on cells in a microfluidic channel. Normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and myeloma, human primary glioblastoma (U87), human  carcinoma (Caco-2), and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells are investigated for the release of NH. The P-E7 is able to visualize NH release from the cell via a radial-to-bipolar (R-B) orientation change, observed through a polarized optical microscope. The various cell lines significantly differ in their response time required for an R-B change. The mean response times for Caco-2, U87, and MCF-7 cells are 277, 155, and 121 s, respectively. NH release from a single cell captured in a microwell flow chip shows a similar R-B change.

However, due to various side effects associated with the above treatment strategy, the need for combinatorial therapeutic strategies has emerged. Based on the demand for new combinatorial therapies and the known antitumor effects of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty , docosahexaenoic  (DHA), we investigated the Oxaliplatin and DHA combination for its effect. Our results indicated that DHA further enhanced Oxaliplatin-induced cell viability and autophagic cell death, in vitro and in vivo. Oxaliplatin and DHA also increased the expression of Sestrin 2 (SESN2) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress related C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Additionally, treatment with Oxaliplatin and DHA enhanced the binding of CHOP to the promotor region of SESN2, increasing SESN2 expression.

While each field of research (, oxysterols, and circadian clock) is well-studied within their specialty, little is known about the intertwining mechanisms and how these influence the disease etiology in each  type. Oxysterols are involved in pathology of these cancers, but final conclusions about their protective or damaging effects are elusive, since the effect depends on the type of oxysterol, concentration, and the cell type. Oxysterol concentrations, the expression of key regulators liver X receptors (LXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and oxysterol-binding proteins (OSBP) family are modulated in tumors and plasma of  patients, exposing these proteins and selected oxysterols as new potential biomarkers and drug targets. Evidence about how cholesterol/oxysterol pathways are intertwined with circadian clock is building. Identified key contact points are different forms of retinoic  receptor related orphan receptors (ROR) and LXRs. RORs and LXRs are both regulated by sterols/oxysterols and the circadian clock and in return also regulate the same pathways, representing a complex interplay between sterol metabolism and the clock. With this in mind, in addition to classical therapies to modulate cholesterol in gastrointestinal cancers, such as the statin therapy, the time is ripe also for therapies where time and duration of the drug application is taken as an important factor for successful therapies. The final goal is the personalized approach with chronotherapy for disease management and treatment in order to increase the positive drug effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297055>Targeting the Eph/Ephrin System as Anti-Inflammatory Strategy in IBD.</a></h2><p>Besides their long-known critical role in embryonic growth and in  development and progression, erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma type B (EphB) receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin-B ligands are involved in the modulation of immune responses and in remodeling and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial layer. These processes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory-based disorders of the gut, like inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Accordingly, our aim was to investigate the role of the EphB/ephrin-B system in intestinal inflammation by assessing the local and systemic effects produced by its pharmacological manipulation in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)- (Th1-dependent model) and dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)- (innate response model) induced colitis in mice. To this purpose, we administered chimeric Fc-conjugated proteins, allegedly able to uni-directionally activate either forward (ephrin-B1-Fc) or reverse (EphB1-Fc) signaling, and the soluble monomeric EphB4 extracellular domain protein, that, simultaneously interfering with both signaling pathways, acts as EphB/ephrin-B antagonist.The blockade of the EphB/ephrin-B forward signaling by EphB4 and EphB1-Fc was ineffective against DSS-induced colitis while it evoked remarkable beneficial effects against TNBS colitis: it counteracted all the evaluated inflammatory responses and the changes elicited on splenic T lymphocytes subpopulations, without preventing the appearance of a splice variant of ephrin-B2 gene elicited by the haptenating agent in the . Interestingly, EphB4, preferentially displacing EphB4/ephrin-B2 interaction over EphB1/ephrin-B1 binding, was able to promote Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) release by splenic mononuclear cells . On the whole, the collected results point to a potential role of the EphB/ephrin-B system as a pharmacological target in intestinal inflammatory disorders and suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of its blockade seemingly works through the modulation of immune responses, independent of the changes at the transcriptional and translational level of EphB4 and ephrin-B2 genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31031170>Intestinal Bile  Induce a Morphotype Switch in Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus that Facilitates Intestinal Colonization.</a></h2><p>Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) are highly antibiotic-resistant and readily transmissible pathogens that cause severe infections in hospitalized patients. We discovered that lithocholic  (LCA), a secondary bile  prevalent in the cecum and  of mice and humans, impairs separation of growing VRE diplococci, causing the formation of long chains and increased biofilm formation. Divalent cations reversed this LCA-induced switch to chaining and biofilm formation. Experimental evolution in the presence of LCA yielded mutations in the essential two-component kinase yycG/walK and three-component response regulator liaR that locked VRE in diplococcal mode, impaired biofilm formation, and increased susceptibility to the antibiotic daptomycin. These mutant VRE strains were deficient in host colonization because of their inability to compete with intestinal microbiota. This morphotype switch presents a potential non-bactericidal therapeutic target that may help clear VRE from the intestines of dominated patients, as occurs frequently during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It has been reported to exhibit strong anticancer properties against a variety of cancers. Our previous studies showed that UA promoted apoptosis in colorectal  (CRC) cells and inhibited cellular proliferation and angiogenesis. However, the effect and underlying molecular mechanism of UA in CRC progression remain unclear. In the present study, the role of UA in suppressing the migration and invasion of human  HCT116 and HCT-8 cells was investigated, using Transwell assays. In addition, to evaluate whether the anticancer properties of UA were mediated by the regulation of a double-negative feedback loop consisting of the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox (ZEB1) pathway and microRNA (miR)-200a/b/c, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis were performed. The results indicated that UA treatment significantly suppressed cellular growth, migration and invasion in HCT116 and HCT-8 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, following UA treatment, several crucial mediators of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, including TGF-β1, phosphorylated (p)-Smad2/3, p-focal adhesion kinase and ZEB1, were significantly downregulated in the HCT116 and HCT-8 cell lines compared with the control group. Furthermore, the ratio of N-cadherin/E-cadherin, two proteins directly downstream of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, was found to be downregulated in UA treated CRC cells. Finally, UA significantly upregulated miR200a/b/c, with miR-200c exhibiting the highest increase in expression levels following UA treatment. Collectively, the present study suggested that inhibition of CRC cell invasion by UA occurred via regulation of the TGF-β1/ZEB1/miR-200c signaling network, which may be one of the mechanisms by which UA appears to be an effective therapeutic agent against .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503525>Study on Biological Activity of Bread Enriched with Natural Polyphenols in Terms of Growth Inhibition of Tumor Intestine Cells.</a></h2><p>A complex plant polyphenolic preparation (PP) was produced from chokeberry, raspberry, wild strawberry, peach, bilberry, apricot, cranberry, and parsley, using ultrafiltration and C18 preparative chromatography.

At this concentration of EBD fluid, modification in cellular morphology was also observed. DPPH analysis revealed that the highest antioxidant activity was observed at concentration of 75 g/mL, both PP and EBD fluid. Our results show that an introduction of PP into relatively low-polyphenolic, baking products should be carefully considered because polyphenols still retain its biological activity. Antioxidant activity of polyphenols is one of the mechanisms that explains the observed effect of inhibiting the growth of  cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31320819>Effects of B2O3 (boron trioxide) on  cells: our first-step experience and in vitro results.</a></h2><p>Boron oxide (B2O3) is derived from dehydration of boric  and is a colorless, semitransparent, crystalline compound that is moderately soluble in water. On the other hand, boron oxide is chemically hygroscopic. This gives the molecule the ability to soak up water and adhere to tissues. Boron oxide can be used locally after tumor debulking in inoperable tumors and especially when the tumor-free margin distance cannot be provided. For all these reasons we aimed to evaluate the in vitro test results of B2O3 in terms of cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, apoptosis, and necrotic effects on L929 fibroblast cells and DLD-1 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Our studies demonstrated that boron oxide compounds appear to be highly cytotoxic for both cell lines according to WST cell viability assay (44.22% and 18.36% on DLD-1 and L929, respectively). Although no genotoxic effects were observed, boron oxide compounds showed antiproliferative effects for both cell lines. The prepared boron oxide compounds may hold the potential to be applied locally to the remaining tissue after surgery and further research and evaluation will be needed to determine its effectiveness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31186727>Radiosensitizing effect of 5-aminolevulinic  in colorectal   and .</a></h2><p>The radiosensitizing effect of 5-aminolevulinic  (5-ALA) has been demonstrated in glioma and melanoma in a number of studies.

Mitochondrial C1 metabolism, including serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) 2, provides glycine, NAD(P)H, ATP, and C1 units for cytosolic biosynthetic reactions, and is implicated in the oncogenic phenotype across a wide range of cancers. Whereas multitargeted inhibitors of cytosolic C1 metabolism, such as pemetrexed, are used clinically, there are currently no anticancer drugs that specifically target mitochondrial C1 metabolism. We used molecular modeling to design novel small-molecule pyrrolo[3,2-]pyrimidine inhibitors targeting mitochondrial C1 metabolism at SHMT2.  antitumor efficacy was established with the lead compounds (, , ) toward lung, , and pancreatic  cells. Intracellular targets were identified by metabolic rescue with glycine and nucleosides, and by targeted metabolomics using a stable isotope tracer, with confirmation by  assays with purified enzymes. In addition to targeting SHMT2, inhibition of the cytosolic purine biosynthetic enzymes, β-glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and/or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase, and SHMT1 was also established.  generated significant  antitumor efficacy with potential for complete responses against both early-stage and upstage MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic tumor xenografts, providing compelling proof-of-concept for therapeutic targeting of SHMT2 and cytosolic C1 enzymes by this series.

Since, this clinically applied enzyme was derived from Mycobacterium spp, thus, searching for ADI from eukaryotic microbes "especially thermophilic fungi" could have a novel biochemical, conformational and catalytic properties. Aspergillus nidulans ADI was purified with 5.3 folds, with molecular subunit structure 48 kDa and entire molecular mass 120 kDa, ensuring its homotrimeric identity. The peptide fingerprinting analysis revealing the domain Glu-Gly-Gly as the conserved active site of A. nidulans ADI, with higher proximity to Mycobacterium ADI clade IV. In an endeavor to fortify the structural stability and anticancer activity of A. nidulans ADI, the enzyme was chemically modified with dextran. The optimal activity of Dextran-ADI conjugates was determined at 0.08:20 M ratio of ADI: Dextran, with an overall increase to ADI molecular subunit mass to ˜100 kDa. ADI was conjugated with dextran via the ε-amino groups interaction of surface lysine residues of ADI. The resistance of Dextran-ADI conjugate to proteolysis had been increased by 2.5 folds to proteinase K and trypsin, suggesting the shielding of >50% of ADI surface proteolytic recognition sites. The native and Dextran-ADI conjugates have the same optimum reaction temperature (37 °C), reaction pH and pH stability (7.0-8.0) with dependency on K ions as a cofactor. Dextran-ADI conjugates exhibited a higher thermal stability by ˜ 2 folds for all the tested temperatures, ensuring the acquired structural and catalytic stability upon dextran conjugation. Dextran conjugation slightly protect the reactive amino and thiols groups of surface amino  of ADI from amino  suicide inhibitors. The affinity of ADI was increased by 5.3 folds to free L-arginine with a dramatic reduction in citrullination of peptidylarginine residues upon dextran conjugation. The anticancer activity of ADI to breast (MCF-7), liver (HepG-2) and  (HCT8, HT29, DLD1 and LS174 T)  cell lines was increased by 1.7 folds with dextran conjugation in vitro. Pharmacokinetically, the half-life time of ADI was increased by 1.7 folds upon dextran conjugation, in vivo. From the biochemical and hematological parameters, ADIs had no signs of toxicity to the experimental animals. In addition to the dramatic reduction of L-arginine in serum, citrulline level was increased by 2.5 folds upon dextran conjugation of ADI. This is first report exploring thermostable ADI from thermophilic A. nidulans with robust structural stability, catalytic efficiency and proteolytic resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, clinical use of 5-FU is limited because of the low efficacy of drug uptake and systemic toxic effects. Therefore, there is a critical need to find better drug delivery systems in order to improve the efficacy of the drug. In present study, we have developed a novel combination drug delivery system based on PHBV/PLGA NPs for delivery of 5-FU to  cells. NPs were prepared by the double emulsion method and their optimization of preparation was evaluated using Box-Behnken design (BBD) of response surface methodology (RSM). 5-FU loaded NPs were characterized by SEM, DSC, TGA and FT-IR. SEM image implied that NPs were spherical in shape and the results of DSC, TGA and FT-IR suggest that 5-FU was encapsulated into NPs. The obtained results revealed that 5-FU loaded PHBV/PLGA NPs induced significant higher cell death at concentration much lower than free 5-FU. Results of hemolysis assay indicated that the NPs were hemo-compatible anti-tumor studies showed that 5-FU loaded NPs reduced tumor volume significantly in comparison with free 5-FU.

Moreover, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed in three  cell lines. Rh2HAZnO induced apoptotic process through p53-mediated pathway by upregulating p53 and BAX and downregulating BCL2.

Isothiocyanates, the bio-active hydrolysis products of glucosinolates, naturally produced by several Brassicaceae species, play an important role in human health and agriculture. This study aims at correlating the content of aliphatic glucosinolates to the expression of genes involved in their synthesis in Brassica oleracea, and perform functional analysis of BoMYB29 gene. To this purpose, three genotypes were used: a sprouting broccoli, a cabbage, and a wild genotype (Winspit), a high glucosinolate containing accession. Winspit showed the highest transcript level of BoMYB28, BoMYB29 and BoAOP2 genes, and BoAOP2 expression was positively correlated with that of the two MYB genes. Further analyses of the aliphatic glucosinolates also showed a positive correlation between the expression of BoAOP2 and the production of sinigrin and gluconapin in Winspit. The Winspit BoMYB29 CDS was cloned and overexpressed in Winspit and in the DH AG1012 line. Overexpressing Winspit plants produced higher quantities of alkenyl glucosinolates, such as sinigrin. Conversely, the DH AG1012 transformants showed a higher production of methylsulphinylalkyl glucosinolates, including glucoraphanin, and, despite an up-regulation of the aliphatic glucosinolate genes, no increase in alkenyl glucosinolates. The latter may be explained by the absence of a functional AOP2 gene in DH AG1012. Nevertheless, an extract of DH AG1012 lines overexpressing BoMYB29 provided a chemoprotective effect on human  cells.

Currently, there is no established supportive therapy that can be performed to aid in continuing regorafenib intake under these problematic conditions. We report the case of a 59-year-old Japanese woman diagnosed with recurrence after curative operation for sigmoid  (T3N2aM0, Stage IIIC). Despite undergoing multiple lines of standard chemotherapy, disease control could not be maintained. Consequently, regorafenib was started as a late-line treatment. However, after 2 weeks, the patient experienced regorafenib-induced serious erythema multiforme; thus, regorafenib was discontinued and oral prednisolone was started. Regorafenib administration was resumed when the adverse effects resolved and prednisolone was stopped, but skin rash rapidly reappeared. Prednisolone treatment was reintroduced, which cured the rash; thus, after the third attempt to administer regorafenib, prednisolone was continuously administered. There was no relapse of the rash under prednisolone administration, and the patient received a total of 13 courses of regorafenib. Moreover, the metastatic lesions that had started to regrow at the end of the regorafenib therapy showed good response to the rechallenge chemotherapy of folinic , fluorouracil, and irinotecan therapy with panitumumab.

In this report, we focus on understanding the relationship between common genetic variants and metabolites of FOCM. We conducted a genome-wide association study of FOCM biomarkers among 1,788 unaffected (without CRC) individuals of European ancestry from the  Family Registry. Twelve metabolites, including 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, vitamin B (flavin mononucleotide and riboflavin), vitamin B (4-pyridoxic , pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine), total homocysteine, methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, cystathionine, and creatinine were measured from plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) or LC-MS/MS. For each individual biomarker, we estimated genotype array-specific associations followed by a fixed-effect meta-analysis. We identified the variant rs35976024 (at 2p11.2 and intronic of ATOH8) associated with total homocysteine (p = 4.9 × 10 ). We found a group of six highly correlated variants on chromosome 15q14 associated with cystathionine (all p < 5 × 10 ), with the most significant variant rs28391580 (p = 2.8 × 10 ). Two variants (rs139435405 and rs149119426) on chromosome 14q13 showed significant (p < 5 × 10 ) associations with S-adenosylhomocysteine. These three biomarkers with significant associations are closely involved in homocysteine metabolism. Furthermore, when assessing the principal components (PCs) derived from seven individual biomarkers, we identified the variant rs12665366 (at 6p25.3 and intronic of EXOC2) associated with the first PC (p = 2.3 × 10 ). Our data suggest that common genetic variants may play an important role in FOCM, particularly in homocysteine metabolism.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168274>Carcinoma in a  Conduit Post Esophagectomy: a Case Report.</a></h2><p> Conduit is a commonly used form of reconstruction post esophagectomy either for malignancy, strictures due to caustic  ingestion, or other benign conditions.

The  Genome Atlas identified hypermutated CRCs with somatic mutations in DNA polymerase ε (POLE) with mutation burdens exceeding that of MMR-deficient CRCs.To identify the morphologic, immunophenotypic and molecular features of POLE mutated CRCs, 63 consecutive MMR-intact CRCs were evaluated by Sanger sequencing for POLE exonuclease domain mutations in exons 9, 11, 13 and 14 and confirmed by next generation sequencing. Tumor immune microenvironment and immunoscores were assessed in POLE-mutated CRCs using immunohistochemistry to detect CD3+/CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and compared to 59 non-POLE mutated MMR-intact CRC, 10 non-POLE mutated MMR-deficient CRCs, and 223 normal  mucosa.4.8% CRC (4 MMR-intact primary and 1 MMR-intact metastasis) harbored POLE mutations in amino  286 in exon 9 (p.P286R) or exon 13 (p.V411L). POLE mutated CRCs arose in the transverse  and rectum, were male-predominant, younger, and showed increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and immune cells at the tumor-stromal interface. The patient with metastatic POLE mutated CRC was placed on PD-1 inhibitor treatment with marked and sustained response. These data indicate that POLE mutated CRCs have hypermutated phenotypes despite MMR-intact status, with mutation burdens higher than that in microsatellite unstable CRCs. Given the recent approval for treatment of microsatellite unstable  with immune checkpoint inhibitors, assessment of POLE status may help guide therapeutic decisions for hypermutated tumors with intact MMR that would otherwise be missed by routine testing.This article is protected by copyright.

Triterpenoids is one of its main components. However, the detailed pharmacological activity and the component responsible for its clinical effects are still elusive.To test the in vivo colitis-associated  (CAC) preventive effect of the water fraction extracted from the roots of I. rotunda, and to evaluate its microRNA (miRNA)-related mechanism.Male or female C57BL/6 mice (12 weeks of age) were used to construct the azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced CAC. 12.5 mg/kg and 25.0 mg/kg of the standardized water extract of I. rotunda (WIR), being equal to 4.29 and 8.58 g of the raw medicine respectively, were adopted to treat the AOM/DSS-induced CAC from the fourth week and continued for 5 weeks. Mice were killed two weeks after the end of the last round of DSS by cervical dislocation.The chemical analysis of WIR revealed the presence of 21 compounds. The syringing and caffeic  (1-hydroxyl-4-O-β-D-glucopyranosylprenyl)-ester are the main components of WIR, counting for 8.27% and 5.71% of the water extract respectively. The levels of miR-31-5p were up-regulated in both thp1 and Caco2 cells (p < 0.05) stimulated by either IL-6 or TNF-α, and WIR could restore miR-31-5p levels in the IL-6/TNF-α-stimulated thp-1 and Caco2 cells. Furthermore, WIR decreased TNF-α and IL-6 levels in PMA-differentiated thp-1 cells stimulated by LPS via NF-κB pathway (p < 0.05), suggesting that WIR could restore miR-31-5p expression via down-regulating IL-6 and TNF-α levels. In vivo study showed that oral administration of WIR (25 mg/kg) produced a significant inhibition on the atypical hyperplasia, as well as the release and the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in the  tissue. The in vivo transcription of other pro-inflammatory mediators such as iNOS, IL-11, and IL-17A were also attenuated by WIR administration (25 mg/kg, p < 0.05). Meanwhile, WIR (25 mg/kg) restored the miR-31-5p level which was up-regulated in the CAC model group, and ectopic expressions of the miR-31-5p down-stream LATS2 and YAP genes in the hippo pathway were also modulated by the WIR (25 mg/kg) treatment.The present study suggests that WIR exerts intestinal anti-inflammatory and CAC preventive effects in an experimental CAC mouse model. The CAC preventive effect can be attributed to the suppression of hippo pathway activated by the inflammatory cytokines, indicating that WIR can be potentially used as an herbal product for CAC prevention. Therefore, there is an emergent need for further evaluation of the main components in WIR to determine the definite bioactive component responsible for the CAC preventive activity.Copyright © 2019.

However, the molecular mechanisms need to be elucidated. Here, we identified that SAD possessed potent cytotoxicity in 3 pairs of MDR and their parental sensitive cells including S1-MI-80 and S1, H460/MX20 and H460, MCF-7/ADR and MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, SAD induced cell G2/M phase arrest  the downregulation of cyclin B1 and the increase of CDC2 phosphorylation. Importantly, JNK pathway upregulated the expression of c-Jun in protein level and increased c-Jun phosphorylation induced by SAD, which was linked to cell apoptosis  c-Jun/Src/STAT3 pathway. To investigate the mechanisms of upregulation of c-Jun protein by SAD, the mRNA expression level and degradation of c-Jun were examined. We found that SAD did not alter the mRNA level of c-Jun but inhibited its proteasome-dependent degradation. Taken together, these results implicate that SAD induces  cell death through c-Jun/Src/STAT3 signaling axis by inhibiting the proteasome-dependent degradation of c-Jun in both sensitive cells and ATP-binding cassette transporter sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2)-mediated MDR cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451212>Diet, lipids and .</a></h2><p>Dietary fat is digested and absorbed in the small intestine and can then be utilized as an energy source and/or as a reservoir for other bioactive lipid species.

Their size properties allow passive targeting of  tissue by exploiting the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Furthermore, surface modifications enable an active drug targeting for diseased regions in the human body. Besides the advantages, the drug release from commonly used biodegradable NP is mostly depending on physiological circumstances. Hence, there is a need for a more controllable drug release. The use of light-responsive polymers is an innovative conception enabling a more distinct drug release by an external light stimulus. The idea provides potential for an increase in efficiency and safety of local therapies. In this study, innovative light-sensitive NP were investigated for a photodynamic therapy (PDT) of gastrointestinal tumors. Nanoparticles based on a newly developed light-responsive polycarbonate (LrPC) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic-) (PLGA) were loaded with the approved photosensitizer 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(m-hydroxyphenyl)chlorin (mTHPC). Mucus penetrating properties were obtained by surface PEGylation of the nanoparticles either by using LrPC in combination with a PEGylated PLA (PEG-PLA) or by a combination with PEGylated LrPC (LrPC-PEG). Cytotoxic potential in dependency of a light-induced drug release was investigated in different cytotoxicity assays.

Although fluorescence dyes or genetically encoded biosensors have been developed, CL is still used due to its high sensitivity, ease of use, and low cost. While initially established and used to measure high levels of ROS in phagocytic cells, CL assays are not ideal for measuring low levels of ROS. Here, we developed a newly modified CL assay using a chemiluminescent imaging system for measuring low concentrations of ROS in nonphagocytic cells. We found that dissolving luminol in NaOH, rather than DMSO, increased the HO-induced CL signal and that the addition of 4-iodophenylboronic  (4IPBA) further increased CL intensity. Our new system also increased the rate and intensity of the CL signal in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate- (PMA-) treated HT-29  cells compared to those in luminol only. We were able to quantify ROS levels from both cells and media in parallel using an HO standard. A significant benefit to our system is that we can easily measure stimulus-induced ROS formation in a real-time manner and also investigate intracellular signaling pathways from a single sample simultaneously. We found that PMA induced tyrosine phosphorylation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), protein tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), and Src, and increased actin stress fiber formation in a ROS-dependent manner. Interestingly, treatment with either N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) reduced the PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of these PTKs, implicating a potential role in cellular ROS signaling. Thus, our newly optimized CL assay using 4IPBA and a chemiluminescent imaging method provides a simple, real-time, and low-cost method for the quantification of low levels of ROS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31192246>Adjuvant Chemotherapy of Locally Advanced : Final Results of a Randomized Trial Comparing 5-Fluorouracil and Folinic  with Folfiri.</a></h2><p>There is still the need to optimize adjuvant treatment of  (CC). Standard adjuvant chemotherapy using 5-fluorouracil (FU) and folinic  (FA) was compared with a combination including irinotecan (Folfiri). The aim of the present report was to analyze overall survival (OS) after long-term follow-up, to summarize final recurrence rates and toxicity data, and to identify possible clinical and pathological factors associated with prognosis.Patients (CC stage IIb and III) were randomized to a 6-month treatment with FUFA or Folfiri. The trial was closed after 275 of 588 planned patients, 269 of which were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.133 and 136 patients received FUFA and Folfiri, respectively. Adjuvant therapy was not completed for 16 FUFA (12.0%) and 44 Folfiri (32.4%) patients. Toxicities grade III and IV were observed in 17 (12.8%) patients treated with FUFA and in 50 (36.8%) patients treated with Folfiri. Recurrences occurred in 46 of 133 (34.6%) and in 47 of 136 (34.6%) patients who received FUFA and Folfiri, respectively. 5-year OS rates were 69.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 61.2-77.1) for FUFA and 72.7% (95% CI: 63.9-79.8) for Folfiri. OS was associated with tumor grading (1 & 2 vs. 3), tumor sub-stage (II vs. IIIa vs. IIIb vs. IIIc), and tumor location (left vs. right ).Folfiri cannot be generally recommended for adjuvant chemotherapy of CC. Besides tumor grading and sub-staging, prognosis of CC may depend on tumor location.

Quercetin has been reported to inhibit digestive system cancers including pancreatic  (PAAD) and  (COAD), but rectal  (READ) has not been reported. The reported mechanisms and targets are divergent. In this study, new targets and mechanisms were predicted for the influence of quercetin on PAAD, COAD, and READ using bioinformatics methods. The results showed that quercetin may target CD36 and reduce the death rate caused by PAAD by enhancing the cell adhesion, mediating the uptake of fatty  (FAs), regulating thrombospondin-1, and stimulating the immune response. Quercetin may lower the death rate from READ by targeting SLCO1B1 and producing enhanced effects from use of this compound, inhibiting cell growth, and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. ACADS, ALDH3B2, UGT2A3, AMH, CDKN2A, FOSL1, CD36, CFL2, CYP3A4, and MAF were identified as targets for quercetin to reduce the death rate caused by COAD. Glutathione metabolism was mainly involved in the effect of quercetin on COAD, including the enhancement of the oxidation of fatty , the metabolism of anticancer medications, and the stiffness of cells, and the reduction of chemical carcinogenesis, the level of anti-Müllerian hormone, the proliferation of  cells and transcriptional misregulation, and mediation of the activity of glutathione transferases.

This EPA mechanism has been revealed to lead to several anticancer effects. While the effects of EPA on  cells have been investigated, particularly in terms of angiogenesis, its effects on the tumor stroma remain unclear. In the present study, the authors clarified the role of EPA in  angiogenesis against ‑associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from the  stroma. With established human CAFs and normal fibroblasts from  stroma (NFs), the authors evaluated IL‑6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion with or without EPA treatment using ELISA. The signal inhibition of mitogen‑activated protein kinase (ERK) in CAFs by EPA was evaluated using western blotting. In vitro anti‑angiogenesis effects were evaluated by the angiogenesis assay on Matrigel using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured with the supernatant obtained from CAF cultures with or without EPA. IL‑6 secretion was greater from CAFs compared with that from NFs and stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in greater IL‑6 secretion from the two fibroblast types compared with that from fibroblasts without LPS stimulation. While LPS stimulation increased VEGF secretion from the two fibroblast types, EPA decreased IL‑6 and VEGF secretion from CAFs. Western blotting revealed that the addition of 30 µM EPA inhibited the ERK phosphorylation signal in CAFs. Furthermore, the angiogenesis assay with Matrigel revealed that the CAF culture supernatants treated with EPA suppressed tubular formation in HUVECs. These reductions may have been caused by the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by EPA. Thus, EPA reduces  angiogenesis associated with CAFs. Additional studies will be needed to clarify the continuous anti‑angiogenetic effect of chemotherapy using angiogenesis inhibitors (e.g. bevacizumab and aflibercept) in conjunction with or without EPA, and the clinical usage of EPA in conjunction with chemotherapy in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481234>Clinical and biochemical relevance of monounsaturated fatty  metabolism targeting strategy for  stem cell elimination in .</a></h2><p>Lipid metabolism is associated with  prognosis and incidence. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which converts fully saturated fatty  (SFAs) to monounsaturated fatty  (MUFAs), has been suggested as a vulnerable target for selective elimination of  stem cells (CSCs). However, the clinical significance and physiological role of SCD1 in CSCs has not been well demonstrated. Here, we showed the clinical and biochemical relevance of blocking SCD1 to target CSCs by analyzing human  data from TCGA and through lipidomic profiling of CSCs with or without SCD1 inhibition using mass spectrometry. Positive associations between SCD1 expression and colorectal  patient clinical status and the expression of CSC-related genes (WNT and NOTCH signaling) were found based on TCGA data analysis. Lipidomic profiling of CSCs and bulk  cells (BCCs) using mass spectrometry revealed that  CSCs contained a distinctive lipid profile, with higher free MUFA and lower free SFA levels than in BCCs, suggesting that enhanced SCD1 activity generates MUFAs that may support WNT signaling in CSCs. In addition, all identified phosphatidyl-ethanolamine-containing MUFAs were found at higher levels in CSCs. Interestingly, we observed lower phosphatidyl-serine (18:1/18:0), phosphatidyl-choline (PC; p-18:0/18:1)), and sphingomyelin (SM; d18:1/20:0 or d16:1/22:0) levels in CSCs than in BCCs. Of those, SCD1 inhibition, which efficiently diminished free MUFA levels, increased those specific PC and SM and MUFAs in CSCs promptly. These results suggest that these specific lipid composition is critical for CSC stem cell maintenance. In addition, not only free MUFAs, which are known to be required for WNT signaling, but also other phospholipids, such as SM, which are important for lipid raft formation, may mediate other cell signaling pathways that support CSC maintenance. Comparison of the lipidomic profiles of  cells with those of previously reported for glioma cells further demonstrated the tissue specific characteristics of lipid metabolism in CSCs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we present a core-shell type polymeric microgel (CSPM) which combines photodynamic and chemo therapeutic modalities in one-pot system. CSPM localizes in the malignant lesion after intratumoral injection, releases reactive oxygen species (ROS) and anticancer drug (5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine; DFCR) under the near-infrared (NIR) laser treatment. Pheophorbide A (PheoA)-linked poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-HEMA) was designated to a ROS-generating core, and chemically covered with a chitosan shell. In addition, phenylboronic  was employed in chitosan shells and linked to DFCR to form an ROS cleavable boronic ester. The core-shell structure of CSPM was determined by transmission electron microscopy. NIR-responsive photodynamic ROS generation was confirmed by the oxidative reduction of 9,10-dimethylanthracene (a fluorescent dye), and the cascadic release of DFCR by ROS was confirmed by a release study and a live and dead cell imaging study. Typically, poly-HEMA cored microgel increased its volume by 48.9-fold after absorption of body fluid. This swelling property ensured CSPM was retained in tumor tissues after subtumoral injection and the suitability of CSPM for locoregional phototherapy. The therapeutic effect of CSPM was attributed to the combined, cascadic deliveries of cytotoxic ROS and DFCR and confirmed by growth inhibition studies in in vitro pancreatic  cells and in vivo  mouse model.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In general, the methanol and water extracts of  leaves and stem bark showed potent radical scavenging and reducing properties. It was noted that the stem bark extracts were more potent antioxidants as compared to the leaves extracts. The methanol extract of  leaves showed the highest acetyl (4.68 mg galantamine equivalent/g) and butyryl (4.0 mg galantamine equivalent/g) cholinesterase inhibition. Among ethyl acetate extracts, the pharmacological investigation suggested stem bark ethyl acetate extracts to be the most promising.

Both drugs induced a moderate decrease in cell viability and significant DNA damage in both cell lines. LoVo cells were more sensitive to VPA and combined treatment than Caco-2. LoVo cells also showed higher expression of genes that are often associated with more aggressive tumors than Caco-2 cells and treatment with the modifiers increased this difference.

Although several epidemiological studies have shown that hepatic low lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA expression may be associated with dyslipidemia and tumor progression, it is still not known whether the liver plays an essential role in hyperlipidemia of Apc mice.We measured the expression of metabolic enzymes that involved fatty  uptake, de novo lipogenesis (DNL), β-oxidation and investigated hepatic triglyceride production in the liver of wild-type and Apc mice.We found that hepatic fatty  uptake and DNL decreased, but there was no significant difference in fatty  β-oxidation. Interestingly, the production of hepatic very low-density lipoprotein-triglyceride (VLDL-TG) decreased at 20 weeks of age, but marked steatosis was observed in the livers of the Apc mouse. To further explore hypertriglyceridemia, we assessed the function of hepatic glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) for the first time. GPIHBP1 is governed by the transcription factor octamer-binding transcription factor-1 (Oct-1) which are involved in the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway in the liver of Apc mice. Importantly, it was also confirmed that sn50 (100 μg/mL, an inhibitor of the NF-κB) reversed the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced Oct-1 and GPIHBP1 reduction in HepG2 cells.Altogether, these findings highlighted a novel role of GPIHBP1 that might be responsible for hypertriglyceridemia in Apc mice.

The latter, an mRNA termed KRT20, has been shown to be over-expressed in metastases originating from colorectal  (CRC). To these FIT-PNAs, we have introduced the bis-quinoline (BisQ) cyanine dye that emits light in the red region (605-610 nm) of the visible spectrum. Most strikingly, spraying fresh human tissue taken from patients during cytoreductive surgery for peritoneal metastasis of  with an aqueous solution of CCAT1 FIT-PNA results in bright fluorescence in a matter of minutes. In fresh healthy tissue (from bariatric surgeries), no appreciable fluorescence is detected. In addition, a non-targeted FIT-PNA shows no fluorescent signal after spraying this FIT-PNA on fresh tumor tissue emphasizing the specificity of these molecular sensors. This study is the first to show on-site direct and immediate visualization of an RNA  biomarker on fresh human  tissues by topical application (spraying) of a molecular sensor.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

As these isoforms can have altered stability, localisation and coding potential, deregulation of APA can disrupt gene expression and this has been linked to many diseases including  progression. How APA generates -specific isoform profiles and what their physiological consequences are, however, is largely unclear. Here we use a subcellular fractionation approach to determine the nuclear and cytoplasmic APA profiles of successive stages of  using a cell line-based model. Using this approach, we show that during  progression specific APA profiles are established. We identify that overexpression of hnRNPC has a critical role in the establishment of APA profiles characteristic for metastatic  cells, by regulating poly(A) site selection in a subset of genes that have been implicated in  progression including MTHFD1L.© The Author(s) 2019.

CtBPs act by repressing expression of genes responsible for apoptosis (e.g., PUMA, BIK) and metastasis-associated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (e.g., CDH1), and by activating expression of genes that promote migratory and invasive properties of  cells (e.g., TIAM1) and genes responsible for enhanced drug resistance (e.g., MDR1). CtBP's transcriptional functions are also critically dependent on oligomerization and nucleation of transcriptional complexes. Recently, we have developed a family of CtBP dehydrogenase inhibitors, based on the parent 2-hydroxyimino-3-phenylpropanoic  (HIPP), that specifically disrupt  cell viability, abrogate CtBP's transcriptional function, and block polyp formation in a mouse model of intestinal polyposis that depends on CtBP's oncogenic functions. Crystallographic analysis revealed that HIPP interacts with CtBP1/2 at a conserved active site tryptophan (W318/324; CtBP1/2) that is unique among eukaryotic D2-dehydrogenases. To better understand the mechanism of action of HIPP-class inhibitors, we investigated the contribution of W324 to CtBP2's biochemical and physiologic activities utilizing mutational analysis. Indeed, W324 was necessary for CtBP2 self-association, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation and in vivo cross-linking. Additionally, W324 supported CtBP's association with the transcriptional corepressor CoREST, and was critical for CtBP2 induction of cell motility. Notably, the HIPP derivative 4-chloro-HIPP biochemically and biologically phenocopied mutational inactivation of CtBP2 W324. Our data support further optimization of W318/W324-interacting CtBP dehydrogenase inhibitors that are emerging as a novel class of  cell-specific therapeutic.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094234>Telmisartan Influences the Antiproliferative Activity of Linoleic  in Human  Cells.</a></h2><p>Linoleic  (LA) and telmisartan as PPARgamma agonists exhibit anticancer activity. The LA effect is observed for high non-achievable in vivo concentrations and in short treatment period, therefore we evaluate the effect of supplemental LA and pharmacological telmisartan plasma concentrations on human primary (SW480) and metastatic (SW620)  cells and immortal keratinocytes (HaCaT) cells in long-term treatment.Cell viability and proliferation were determined by TB and MTT and pro-apoptotic effect was measured by Annexin V binding assays, respectively.LA decreased  cell viability and proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas no significant effect was found for HaCaT cells. Telmisartan (0.2 µM) suppresses antiproliferative effect of 60 µM LA on  cells in short-term treatment. Long-term administration of 60 µM LA reduced  cells viability after one week, while telmisartan delayed this effect by two weeks. Growth of all cell lines with 20 µM LA was unchanged during all treatment time. Telmisartan decreased late apoptosis of  and normal cells with 60 and 120 µM LA.The cytotoxic LA action depends not only on its concentration but also duration of treatment.

Linoleic  conjugated SN38 (LA-SN38)-loaded NPs (EBNPs) were developed using biodegradable poly (ethylene oxide)-poly (butylene oxide) (PEO-PBO) diblock copolymer by titration hydration method without using a toxic organic solvent. The EBNPs had high drug loading efficiency and entrapment efficiency for LA-SN38, at 7.53% and 93.55%, respectively. The polydispersity index (PDI) and average diameter were 0.173 ± 0.019 and 226.1 ± 1.2 nm, respectively. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) image presented that the NPs were homogeneous in size and had spherical structures. In vitro study showed the release behavior of EBNPs was slow and sustained. Furthermore, cytotoxicity and apoptosis assay proved that EBNPs were more effective in growth inhibition of human  cells. Cell uptake experiments further demonstrated that EBNPs could avoid the phagocytosis by macrophages and promote the uptake by  cells. In vivo, EBNPs had prolonged blood circulation time and tumor selectivity in biodistribution. The tumor inhibitory rate of EBNPs was higher compared to SNPs group and CPT-11group (P < 0.01), and the drug did not show significant systemic toxicity at the tested dose. These results indicated that EBNPs are a promising candidate for delivery of LA-SN38 to treat colorectal .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We used a method based on in vitro digestion, dialysis, and kinetic analysis to investigate how dietary fibre enriched food ingredients affect the release of primary and secondary bile  as related to viscosity and adsorption. As the main bile  abundant in humans interactions with glyco- and tauroconjugated cholic , chenodesoxycholic  and desoxycholic  were analysed. Viscous interactions were detected for apple, barley, citrus, lupin, pea, and potato derived ingredients, which slowed the bile  release rate by up to 80%.

Increased intestinal permeability may favour endotoxaemia generated by lipopolysaccharides, a substance present in the cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and, consequently, an increase in systemic inflammation and metabolic diseases. In contrast (On the other hand), consumption of a healthy diet can help in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome. In this way, chia seeds (Salvia hispanica L.), rich in polyunsaturated fatty , may present an anti-inflammatory role. In addition, chia is rich in antioxidants like caffeic and gallic  and fiber. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between chia seeds, inflammatory mechanisms and intestinal permeability. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the effects of chia administration on metabolism in obese mice. Swiss mice were fed a hyperlipidic diet either supplemented with or without 3% chia flour for 16 weeks. The results showed that supplementation could not reduce the deleterious effects of the lipid-rich diet in terms of body composition, glucose intolerance and activity of antioxidants enzymes in the liver. In addition, supplementation with chia in the control diet decreased the amount of occludin in the intestinal . In conclusion, although chia did not improve metabolic parameters it seemed to restore the intestinal barriers integrity. The beneficial effects of chia seem to be dependent of the quantity used, since our data conflict with those in the literature; however, it is important to note that other studies, unlike our protocol, used chia in the form of seeds or oil, and not flour.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Butyrate is a SCFA that was reported to alter the mRNA stability of inflammatory genes by increasiing the expression of the RNA binding protein (RBP) Tristetraprolin (TTP). We have hypothesized that butyrate may regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally through global effects on the expression or cytoplasmic translocation of RBPs. Using bioinformatics analyses of publicly available microarray data as well as  cell lines treated with sodium butyrate, we have observed that butyrate treatment led to a general reduction in expression of several (but not all) RBPs and inhibition in the cytosolic translocation of HuR, a well-known stabilizing RBP. This was reflected in reduced NanoLuc reporter activity of several different AU-rich element (ARE) sequences in the presence of butyrate; this suppression was retained even when HuR was overexpressed. Mechanistically, we have shown that reduced activity of HuR was related to decreased phosphorylation of p38 and MK2 and enhanced phosphorylation of Chk2. As a proof of concept, we show butyrate-mediated inhibition in binding of HuR to the 3'UTR of COX-2 mRNA resulting in reduced mRNA and protein levels of the inflammatory gene. Overall, our data suggest that butyrate can reduce the expression of inflammatory genes not only by transcriptional regulation, but also by post-transcriptional regulation via inhibition of mRNA stabilizing proteins.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the clinical utility of SN38 has been greatly limited due to its undesirable properties, such as poor solubility and low stability.  In order to overcome these weaknesses, moeixitecan, a lipophilic SN38 prodrug containing a SN-38, a trolox, a succinic  linker, and a hexadecanol chain, was loaded into liposomal nanoparticles by ethanol injection method.  Experiments showed that the moeixitecan-loaded liposomal nanoparticles (MLP) with a diameter of 105.10±1.49 nm have a satisfactory drug loading rate (90.54±0.41%), high solubility and stability, and showed sustained release of SN38. Notably, MLP exhibited better antitumor activity against human  adenocarcinoma cells than irinotecan, a FDA-approved drug for the treatment of advanced colorectal . Furthermore, xenograft model results showed that MLP outperformed irinotecan in terms of pharmacokinetics, in vivo therapeutic efficacy and safety. Finally, we used molecular dynamic simulations to explore the association between the structure of MLP and the physical and functional properties of MLP, moeixitecan molecules in MLP folded themselves inside the hydrocarbon chain of the lipid bilayer, which led an increased acyl chain order of the lipid bilayer, and therefore enhanced the lactone ring stability protecting it from hydrolysis.

Commonly known as a kind of constituent macromolecules, non-digestible polysaccharides have always been fermented by the intestinal microbiota. Nostoc commune Vaucher (N. commune) has always been appreciated as a healthy food and supplementation worldwide as it is rich in nutrients. Particularly, polysaccharides account for 60% of the dry weight of N. commune. In this study, we examined the protective effects of the polysaccharides isolated from N. commune (NVPS) against colitis-associated  tumorigenesis in mice treated with azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) and the impact of these polysaccharides on the intestinal microbiota. NVPS were administered to mice through an intragastric gavage for 14 weeks. Our results demonstrated that the treatment with NVPS significantly decreased the number and sizes of tumors and reduced the incidence of intestinal tumors. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR, we analyzed the bacterial composition of the fecal samples obtained from mice. The results demonstrated that the alterations in the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes caused by the AOM/DSS treatment were significantly reversed in response to the NVPS treatment. Moreover, the short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing genera, including butyric -producing genera (Butyricicoccus, Butyrivibrio and Butyricimonas) and acetic -producing genera (Lachnospiraceae UCG 001, Lachnospiraceae UCG 006, and Blautia), were drastically enriched following the NVPS intervention. These compositional alterations induced by the NVPS were associated with the suppressed  inflammation and carcinogenesis.

How MYC regulates the metabolism of other amino  in  is not fully understood. Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we found that MYC increased intracellular levels of tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites in the kynurenine pathway. MYC induced the expression of the tryptophan transporters SLC7A5 and SLC1A5 and the enzyme arylformamidase (AFMID), involved in the conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine. SLC7A5, SLC1A5, and AFMID were elevated in  cells and tissues, and kynurenine was significantly greater in tumor samples than in the respective adjacent normal tissue from patients with . Compared with normal human  epithelial cells,  cells were more sensitive to the depletion of tryptophan. Blocking enzymes in the kynurenine pathway caused preferential death of established  cells and transformed  organoids. We found that only kynurenine and no other tryptophan metabolite promotes the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Blocking the interaction between AHR and kynurenine with CH223191 reduced the proliferation of  cells.

Using a Boyden chamber co-culture system, the migration of the mesenchymal stem cells and their invasion through Matrigel increased in the presence of breast  MDA-MB-231 cells,  HT29 cells or their conditioned media. Mesenchymal stem cell movement was reduced by protease inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases and by pepstatin A, an inhibitor of cathepsin D. We confirmed a role for cathepsin D through addition of recombinant protein, upregulation of cathepsin D release using chloroquine and knockdown of cathepsin D expression. While all cell types expressed active cathepsin D, enzymatically inactive precursor procathepsin D was expressed only at low levels by mesenchymal stem cells. Expression in mesenchymal stem cells was increased following co-culture with  cells. The chemoattractive effect of cathepsin D required its enzymatic activity, but not changes in mesenchymal stem cell proliferation or adhesion rates.

We used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to investigate the distribution and composition of SM species in pork chop consisting of longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle (loin), intermuscular fat tissue, transparent tissue, and spinalis muscle. Four SM species were identified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem MS (MS/MS) and MALDI-MS/MS and visualized using MALDI-IMS. SM species containing stearic  were predominantly distributed in the loin and spinalis muscle, whereas SM species containing palmitic, lignoceric, and nervonic  were predominantly distributed in transparent tissue. These results indicated that the distribution of SM species differed among the pork tissues, depending on the tissue-specific fatty  composition. The total amount including all identified SM species was higher in the loin than in spinalis muscle. Pork is reportedly associated with increased risk for chronic diseases due to the high amount of heme iron. From the observation of color, the amount of heme iron was lower in loin than in spinalis muscle. Thus, the degree of risk for chronic diseases might be lower in the loin than in spinalis muscle. This is the first report on the tissue-specific distribution of SM species in meat at a microscopic resolution using IMS. MALDI-IMS analysis may be useful in assessing the association between SM species and quality parameters of pork meat. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Sphingomyelin (SM) species are major sphingolipids in pork meat. SM species affect quality parameters such as health benefits due to their protective properties against  and atherosclerosis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry analysis combined with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry is a suitable method to directly investigate the distribution and composition of SM species at microscopic level among different tissues of pork meat. Therefore, this method is useful to assess the SM species-induced health effect of different tissues of pork meat.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31418432>An oral drug delivery system with programmed drug release and imaging properties for orthotopic  therapy.</a></h2><p>Oral drug delivery systems (ODDSs) have attracted considerable attention in relation to orthotopic  therapy due to certain popular advantages.

Gadolinium is a paramagnetic lanthanide element used in chelates, working as a contrast medium agent for an MRI system. Interestingly, after oral administration, CS and PAA could protect the drug-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) against variable physiological conditions in the GIT, allowing the drug to reach the  tumor sites, preventing premature drug release. Enhanced drug concentrations at the  tumor sites were achieved via this programmed drug release, which subsequently ameliorated the therapeutic effect.

All of them showed that the type of diet can have an impact on metabolites excreted and therefore can be a useful tool in the nutritional studies related to metabolism and health and disease status. Two studies concerned VOC analysis in inflammatory bowel diseases, and the results showed that VOCs can distinguish active disease from remission; VOC profile is clearly different in patients. In particular, CH 1-pentadecene, 3-methyl-1-butanal, octane, acetic , alpha-pinene, and m-cymene are elevated in active ulcerative colitis.

Tumours located from the splenic flexure to rectum and in the caecum to transverse  were defined as left- and right-sided, respectively. Baseline characteristics were summarised by primary tumour location and the effects of primary tumour location on outcomes-including objective response rate, resection rate, depth of response, duration of response and progression-free survival-were analysed. Progression-free survival and objective response rate were analysed by early tumour shrinkage status.Primary tumour location was determined in 52/69 (75%) patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal ; 45 (87%) had left-sided disease. Median progression-free survival was longer in patients with left-sided tumours (11.2 vs. 7.2 months for right-sided disease) and more of these patients experienced early tumour shrinkage ≥ 30% (53% vs. 29%). Early tumour shrinkage ≥ 30% was associated with improved progression-free survival irrespective of tumour location. More patients with early tumour shrinkage ≥ 30% achieved a partial or complete response. Objective response rate, duration of response, depth of response and resection rates were similar in patients with left- and right-sided tumours.This analysis has confirmed a prognostic effect of primary tumour location in patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal  receiving first-line panitumumab plus FOLFIRI. Early tumour shrinkage was associated with improved progression-free survival irrespective of tumour location. In right-sided disease, early tumour shrinkage may identify a subgroup of patients who might respond to panitumumab.

Therefore, radioprotective measures, against both acute and chronic biological effects of radiation, require frequent intake of nontoxic natural products, which have practical oral administration. The goal of this study was to characterize the radioprotective, radiomitigative and radiation-induced bystander effect-inhibiting properties of endogenous metabolites: phenylacetate, ursodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate. Compounds were administered pre- and postirradiation as well as in donor and recipient bystander flasks to analyze whether these might adequately protect against radiation injury as well as facilitate recovery from the exposures. The clonogenic HCT116 p53 wild-type  cell line in this study shares characteristics of stem cells, such as high reproductive viability, which is an effective marker to demonstrate compound effectiveness. Clonogenic assays were therefore used to characterize radioprotective, radiomitigative and bystander inhibiting properties of treatment compounds whereby cellular responses to radiation were quantified with macroscopic colony counts to measure cell survival in flasks. The results were statistically significant for phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate when administered preirradiation, conferring radioprotection up to 2 Gy, whereas administration postirradiation and in bystander experiments did not confer radioprotection . These findings suggest that phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate might be effective radioprotectors, although they possess no radiomitigative properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31150656>Study on the absorption of corosolic  in the gastrointestinal tract and its metabolites in rats.</a></h2><p>Corosolic  (CRA) has been widely used as a food supplement. However, its pharmacokinetic behavior still needs to be explored. In this study, the absorption of CRA in stomach and intestine were investigated by in situ gastric absorption and in situ single-pass perfusion, respectively. Furthermore, the metabolites of CRA in rat plasma, bile, and urine were identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS. The enzymes responsible for its metabolism were explored by rat liver microsome (RLMs). The effects of plasma containing metabolites on  cell growth and glucose consumption were evaluated by HT29 and HepG2 cells receptively. The results showed that CRA absorption rate is approximately 20% to 40% in stomach. It has similar absorption rate constant (Ka) in duodenum/jejunum/ileum/. However, its effective permeability (P) in ileum at 9 μg/mL is significantly higher than the P in . Moreover, five possible metabolites were identified in plasma and bile, suggesting CRA could be metabolized through methyl carboxylation, hydroxylation, methyl aldehyde substitution, glucuronidation, and acetylation in vivo. Meanwhile, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 were found to participate in its metabolism. The plasma containing metabolites of CRA significantly inhibited the growth of HT29  cells and stimulated glucose consumption of HepG2 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrated that CRA has good absorption in both stomach and small intestine, but it could be metabolized partly due to CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in vivo. Its metabolites might be responsible for the excellent anti- and anti-diabetes activities of CRA. This study will provide evidence for further CRA development.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Accumulating evidence points to the significance of estrogen action not only in tumors of hormonally regulated tissues such as the breast, endometrium and ovary, but also in the development of colorectal  (CRC). The effects of estrogens in physiological and pathophysiological conditions are mediated by the nuclear estrogen receptors α and β, as well as the membrane-bound G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). The roles of GPER in CRC development and progression, however, remain poorly understood. Studies on the functions of GPER in the  have shown that this estrogen receptor regulates  motility as well as immune responses in CRC-associated diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. GPER is also involved in cell cycle regulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, proliferation, apoptosis, vascularization, cell migration, and the regulation of fatty  and estrogen metabolism in CRC cells. Thus, multiple lines of evidence suggest that GPER may play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis.

SIGLEC7-Fc did not recognize newly-expressed GD3 on DLD-1 cells, even though GD3 was highly expressed, as detected by an anti-GD3 antibody. Because milk-derived GD3 could be recognized by this fusion protein when incorporated onto the surface of DLD-1 cells, we compared the ceramides in DLD-1-generated and milk-derived GD3s to identify the SIGLEC7-specific GD3 structures on the cell membrane, revealing that SIGLEC7 recognizes only GD3-containing regular ceramides but not phytoceramides. This was confirmed by knockdown/knockout of the sphingolipid delta(4)-desaturase/C4-monooxygenase () gene, involved in phytoceramide synthesis, disclosing that DES2 inhibition confers SIGLEC7 binding. Furthermore, knocking out fatty  2-hydroxylase also resulted in the emergence of SIGLEC7 binding to the cell surface. To analyze the effects of binding between SIGLEC7 and various GD3 species on natural killer function, we investigated cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors toward GD3S-transfected DLD-1 (DLD-1-GD3S) cells and DLD-1-GD3S cells with modified ceramides. We found that cytotoxicity is suppressed in DLD-1-GD3S cells with dehydroxylated GD3s.

The best condition for AgNPs synthesis was with 0.5 g of peel extract, 7.5 mM silver nitrate at 45 °C, ~pH 4 for 16 h. The synthesized AgNPs were spherical and 32.7 ± 5.7 nm in size. To test its efficiency to be used as drug carrier, plant-based drug, protocatechuic  (PCA) was used as a test drug. AgNPs loaded with PCA (AgPCA) resulted in 80% of inhibition at 15.6 µg/mL as compared to AgNPs which only killed 5% of HCT116 colorectal cells at same concentration. The IC of AgNPs and AgPCA for HCT116 were 40.2 and 10.7 µg/mL, respectively. At 15.6 µg/mL, AgPCA was not toxic to the tested  normal cells, CCD112. Ag-based drug carrier could also potentially reduce the toxicity of loaded drug as the IC of PCA alone (148.1 µg/mL) was higher than IC of AgPCA (10.7 µg/mL) against HCT116. Further, 24-h treatment of 15.6 µg/mL AgPCA resulted in loss of membrane potential in the mitochondria of HCT116 cells and increased level of reaction oxygen species (ROS). These could be the cellular killing mechanisms of AgPCA.

The history of UDCA is briefly retraced here as well as its multifactorial mechanism of action, based on its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective activities. The present review is centred around the anticancer properties of UDCA and synthetic antitumor derivatives designed over the past 20 years. Paradoxically, depending on the conditions, UDCA exhibits both pro- and anti-apoptotic properties toward different cell types. In particular, the UDCA drug can protect epithelial cells from damages and apoptosis while inducing inhibition of proliferation and apoptotic and/or autophagic death of  cells. The effects of UDCA on  cell migration,  stem cells and drug-induced dysbiosis are also evoked. The drug has revealed modest activities against  and gastric cancers but may be useful to improve treatments of hepatocellular carcinoma, notably in combination with other drugs such as sorafenib.

Maintenance of skeletal muscle is an essential concern in  treatment. In nutritional intervention, it is important to focus on differences in metabolism between tumor and skeletal muscle. We examined the influence of oral intake of glucose (0%, 10%, 50%) and 2% medium-chain fatty  (lauric , LAA, C12:0) on tumor growth and skeletal muscle atrophy in mouse peritoneal metastasis models using CT26 mouse  cells and HT29 human  cells. After 2 weeks of experimental breeding, skeletal muscle and tumor were removed and analyzed. Glucose intake contributed to prevention of skeletal muscle atrophy in a sugar concentration-dependent way and also promoted tumor growth. LAA ingestion elevated the level of skeletal muscle protein and suppressed tumor growth by inducing tumor-selective oxidative stress production. When a combination of glucose and LAA was ingested, skeletal muscle mass increased and tumor growth was suppressed. Our results confirmed that although glucose is an important nutrient for the prevention of skeletal muscle atrophy, it may also foster tumor growth. However, the ingestion of LAA inhibited tumor growth, and its combination with glucose promoted skeletal muscle integrity and function, without stimulating tumor growth. These findings suggest novel strategies for the prevention of skeletal muscle atrophy.© 2019 The Authors.

This study evaluated the anticancer and antiangiogenesis activities of pectinase-treated Prunus mume fruit concentrate (PC) and its phenolic components. PC treatment (250 to 1,000 µg/mL) resulted in decreased proliferation of SW480 human colorectal  cells through S-phase cell cycle arrest; however, equivalent concentrations of PC did not show toxicity toward CRL-1539  normal cells. Furthermore, PC-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in SW480 cells, which was characterized by accumulation of apoptotic cell population, cell shrinkage, formation of apoptotic bodies, upregulation of proapoptotic Bax, cleaved PARP, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9, and downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2. Antiangiogenesis effects of PC were assessed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that PC did not inhibit HUVECs proliferation at concentrations of 500 to 1,500 µg/mL. In addition, treatment with PC at nontoxic concentrations (500 to 1,000 µg/mL) blocked vascular endothelial growth factor induced cell migration, invasion, capillary-like tube formation, and angiogenesis from rat aortic rings. HPLC-PDA analysis showed that there were at least four different phenolics including 5-HMF, neochlorogenic , protocatechuic , and syringic . Taken together, these results indicated that PC could be used as a good source of phenolic compounds with selective anticancer and antiangiogenesis activities. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Pectinases are one of the well-known enzyme used in the part of food processing. Treatment of pectinase is a useful strategy to reduce viscosity, turbidity, and pulp particles in the production of fruit juice, extract, and concentrate. In the present study, we found that pectinase-treated P. mume fruit concentrate significantly suppresses colorectal  proliferation and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The significance of our findings is that pectinase-treated P. mume concentrate may be used as a commercial functional food material to inhibit colorectal  and angiogenesis.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31047664>The potential of nanoflow liquid chromatography-nano electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry for global profiling the faecal metabolome.</a></h2><p>Faeces are comprised of a wide array of metabolites arising from the circulatory system as well as the human microbiome. A global metabolite analysis (metabolomics) of faecal extracts offers the potential to uncover new compounds which may be indicative of the onset of bowel diseases such as colorectal  (CRC). To date, faecal metabolomics is still in its infancy and the compounds of low abundance present in faecal extracts poorly characterised. In this study, extracts of faeces from healthy subjects were profiled using a sensitive nanoflow-nanospray LC-MS platform which resulted in highly repeatable peak retention times (<2% CV) and intensities (<15% CV). Analysis of the extracts revealed wide coverage of the faecal metabolome including detection of low abundant signalling compounds such as sex steroids and eicosanoids, alongside highly abundant pharmaceuticals and tetrapyrrole metabolites. A small pilot study investigating differences in metabolomics profiles of faecal samples obtained from 7 CRC, 25 adenomatous polyp and 26 healthy groups revealed that secondary bile , conjugated androgens, eicosanoids, phospholipids and an unidentified haem metabolite were potential classes of metabolites that discriminated between the CRC and control sample groups. However, much larger follow up studies are needed to confirm which components of the faecal metabolome are associated with actual CRC disease rather than dietary influences. This study reveals the potential of nanospray-nanoflow LC-MS profiling of faecal samples from large scale cohort studies for uncovering the role of the faecal metabolome in colorectal disease formation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In ascidians (Chordata-Tunicata), these glycosaminoglycans occur in intracellular granules of oocyte accessory cells and circulating basophil-like cells, resembling mammalian mast cells and basophils, respectively. HS is also a component of the basement membrane of different ascidian organs. We have analyzed an HS isolated from the internal organs of the ascidian , using solution H/C NMR spectroscopy, which allowed us to identify and quantify the monosaccharides found in this glycosaminoglycan. A variety of α-glucosamine units with distinct degrees of sulfation and -acetylation were revealed. The hexuronic  units occur both as α-iduronic  and β-glucuronic , with variable sulfation at the 2-position. A peculiar structural aspect of the tunicate HS is the high content of 2-sulfated β-glucuronic , which accounts for one-third of the total hexuronic  units. Another distinct aspect of this HS is the occurrence of high content of -acetylated α-glucosamine units bearing a sulfate group at position 6. The unique ascidian HS is a potent inhibitor of the binding of human  adenocarcinoma cells to immobilized P-selectin, being 11-fold more potent than mammalian heparin, but almost ineffective as an anticoagulant. Thus, the components of the HS structure required to inhibit coagulation and binding of tumor cells to P-selectin are distinct. Our results also suggest that the regulation of the pathway involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans suffered variations during the evolution of chordates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360471>Durable complete response in a patient with metastatic left-sided  treated with 5-fluorouracil, folinic , and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) and panitumumab: A case report.</a></h2><p>There are rare patients with metastatic  who experience dramatic and durable responses.

This study was aimed to apply a novel 3D h9e peptide hydrogel cell culture system to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemopreventive phenolic  on hepatocarcinoma HepG2 and  adenocarcinoma SW480 cells. Both cell lines grew better in this 3D system with better cell growth and longer exponential phase than that in 2D model. Chlorogenic  (CGA), known as a chemopreventive phenolic , at 0-40 μM for 72 h inhibited cell growth but not viability in both HepG2 and SW480 cells. The inhibition was much less potent in 3D system with an IC value of 58.0 ± 15.8 or 285.6 ± 75.4 μM when compared with 2D model with IC of 5.3 ± 0.3 or 12.0 ± 2.5 μM for HepG2 or SW480, respectively. Furthermore, the recovery of cells grown in 3D system after post-CGA appeared faster than 2D model. Taken together, an advanced 3D model has been established with favoring cell growth and less susceptible to inhibitory treatments in contrast to 2D model, thus predict closely to in vivo situation and may bridge the gap of in vitro to in vivo for prescreening chemopreventive agents for  prevention.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Many studies ascribe the risk of the appearance of this  to the Western life style : a sedentary life, obesity, and low -fiber, high -fat diets can promote the onset of disease. Several studies have shown supplement phytochemicals to have an inhibiting effect on the growth of various cancers through the activation of apoptosis. Our goal was to prove the effectiveness of a natural compound in the combined therapy of colorectal . Trigno M supplement was an optimal candidate as anticancer product for its high concentrations of phenolic , flavonoids and anthocyanins. Our work showed the antitumor activity of Trigno M, extract of Prunus spinosa drupes combined with the nutraceutical activator complex (NAC), in 2D, 3D and in vivo colorectal  models. The cellular model we used both in vitro and in vivo was the HCT116 cell line, particularly suitable for engraftment after inoculation in mice. Trigno M inhibited the growth and colony formation of HCT116 cells (35%) as compared to the chemotherapy treatment with 5-fluorouracil (80%) used in clinical therapy. The reduction of the morphological dimensions in the spheroid cells after Trigno M, was compared with 5-fluorouracil demonstrating the efficacy of the Trigno M compound also in 3D models. Flow cytometric analysis on 3D cells showed a significant increase in the apoptotic cell fraction after Trigno M treatment (44.8%) and a low level of necrotic fraction (6.7%) as compared with control cells. Trigno M and 5-fluorouracil induced the apoptosis in a comparable percentage. Monotherapy with Trigno M in severely immunodeficient mice, carrying  rectal  xenografts, significantly reduced tumor growth. The histopatological analysis of the ectopic tumors showed a lower level of necrosis after Trigno M treatment compared with the control. We conclude that Trigno M is well tolerated by mice, delays colorectal  growth in these animals and should be weighed up for integration of the current multi-drug protocols in the treatment of  carcinoma.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we report that machilin A (MA), which acts as a competitive inhibitor by blocking the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) binding site of LDHA, suppresses growth of  cells and lactate production in various  cell types, including , breast, lung, and liver cancers. Furthermore, MA markedly decreased LDHA activity, lactate production, and intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels induced by hypoxia-induced LDHA expression in  cells, and significantly inhibited colony formation, leading to reduced  cell survival. In mouse models inoculated with murine Lewis lung carcinoma, MA significantly suppressed tumor growth as observed by a reduction of tumor volume and weight; resulting from the inhibition of LDHA activity. Subsequently, the suppression of tumor-derived lactic  in MA-treated  cells resulted in decrease of neovascularization through the regulation of alternatively activated macrophages (M2) polarization in macrophages. Taken together, we suggest that the reduction of lactate by MA in  cells directly results in a suppression of  cell growth. Furthermore, macrophage polarization and activation of endothelial cells for angiogenesis were indirectly regulated preventing lactate production in MA-treated  cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31277482>The Nutritional Value and Biological Activity of Concentrated Protein Fraction of Potato Juice.</a></h2><p>Potato protein is recognized as one of the most valuable nonanimal proteins due to the high content of essential amino . So far, it has not been used in human nutrition on a large scale due to technological limitations regarding its acquisition. In this study, the protein fraction of potato juice was concentrated with the use of membrane separation. The obtained potato juice protein concentrate (PJPC) was characterized in terms of nutritional value and biological activity, and the amino  composition, mineral content, and antioxidant properties were determined. Moreover, in vitro cytotoxic activity against  cells of the gastrointestinal tract was investigated. The results of the present study indicate that PJPC is an excellent source of lysine and threonine, while leucine is its limiting amino , with an amino  score (AAS) of 65%. Moreover, PJPC contains substantial amounts of Fe, Mn, K, and Cu. As demonstrated experimentally, PJPC is also characterized by higher antioxidant potential than potato itself. Biological activity, however, is not limited to antioxidant activity alone. Cytotoxicity studies using a gastric  cell line (Hs 746T), a  cell line (HT-29), and human  normal cells (CCD 841 CoN) proved that PJPC is characterized by selective activity against  cells. It can thus be concluded that the developed method of producing protein concentrate from potato juice affords a product with moderate nutritional value and interesting biological activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301538>Ilexgenin A prevents early  carcinogenesis and reprogramed lipid metabolism through HIF1α/SREBP-1.</a></h2><p>Ilexgenin A (IA), the main bioactive compound from Ilex hainanensis Merr., has significant hypolipidemic activities. However, the effects of IA on colitis-associated colorectal  (CRC) and its mechanisms are still unknown.The study was designed to evaluate the effect of IA on CRC and explore its underlying mechanisms.The effect of IA on colitis related CRC were evaluated in azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mice and the underlying mechanisms were revealed by metabolomics, which were further validated in vivo and in vitro.The Balb/c mice were treated with AOM/DSS to induce CRC model and fed with normal diet with or without 0.02% IA. After the experimental period, samples of plasma were collected and analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time off light mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF). Multivariate statistical tools were used to identify the changes of serum metabolites associated with CRC and responses to IA treatment. HT 29 and HCT 116 cells were stimulated by palmitate (PA) and cultured under hypoxia. Western blot, Q-PCR, and Immunofluorescence staining were performed to confirm the molecular pathway in vivo and in vitro.Our results showed IA significantly inhibited the inflammatory colitis symptoms such as disease activity index score, shortening of  tissues and the increase of inflammatory cytokines. In metabolomic study, 31 potential metabolites associated with CRC were identified and 24 of them were reversed by IA treatment. Most of biomarkers were associated with arachidonic  metabolism, glycerophospholipid catabolism, and phospholipid metabolism, suggesting lipid metabolism might be involved in the beneficial effect of IA on CRC. Furthermore, we also found IA could decrease the expressions of SREBP-1 and its target gene in the  tissues of AOM/DSS mice. It could down-regulate the triglyceride (TG) content and the expressions of HIF1α, SREBP-1, FASN, and ACC in HT 29 and HCT 116 cells. The inhibitory effect of IA on SREBP-1 was also attenuated by desferrioxamine (DFX), suggesting HIF1α is involved in the regulation of IA on SREBP-1.IA prevents early  carcinogenesis in AOM/DSS mice and reprogramed lipid metabolism partly through HIF1α/SREBP-1.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), formed by LRRC8 heteromers, is critically involved in regulatory volume decrease of vertebrate cells. The VRAC has also been proposed to play a role in cell cycle progression and cellular motility. Indeed, recent reports corroborated this notion, with potentially important implications for the VRAC in  progression. In the present study, we examined the role of VRAC during cell proliferation and migration in several cell types, including C2C12 myoblasts, human  HCT116 cells, and U251 and U87 glioblastoma cells. Surprisingly, neither pharmacological inhibition of VRAC with 4-[(2-Butyl-6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-2,3-dihydro-1-oxo-1H-inden-5-yl)oxy]butanoic  (DCPIB), carbenoxolone or 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropyl-amino)benzoic  (NPPB), nor siRNA-mediated knockdown or gene knockout of the essential VRAC subunit LRRC8A affected cell growth and motility in any of the investigated cell lines. Additionally, we found no effect of the VRAC inhibition using siRNA treatment or DCPIB on PI3K/Akt signaling in glioblastoma cells.

Polyamine synthesis decreases with aging, but no significant decrease in polyamine concentrations were found in organs, tissues, and blood of adult animals and humans. We found that healthy dietary patterns were associated with a preference for polyamine-rich foods, and first reported that increased polyamine intake extended the lifespan of mice and decreased the incidence of  induced by repeated administration of moderate amounts of a carcinogen. Recent investigations have revealed that changes in DNA methylation status play an important role in lifespan and aging-associated pathologies. The methylation of DNA is regulated by DNA methyltransferases in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine. Decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine, converted from S-adenosylmethionine by S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, provides an aminopropyl group to synthesize spermine and spermidine and acts to inhibit DNMT activity. Long-term increased polyamine intake were shown to elevate blood spermine levels in mice and humans. In vitro studies demonstrated that spermine reversed changes induced by the inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase (e.g., increased decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine, decreased DNA methyltransferase activity, increased aberrant DNA methylation), whose activity decreases with aging. Further, aged mice fed high-polyamine chow demonstrated suppression of aberrant DNA methylation and a consequent increase in protein levels of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1, which plays a pivotal role on inflammatory process.

The best studied of them, 9-hydroxystearic  (9-HSA), induces apoptosis in cell lines by acting through mechanisms involving different targets. Using mass spectrometry-based lipidomic approaches, we show in this study that 9-HSA levels in human colorectal tumors are diminished when compared with normal adjacent tissue. Since this decrease could be compatible with an escape mechanism of tumors from 9-HSA-induced apoptosis, we investigated different features of the utilization of this hydroxyfatty  in . We show that in colorectal tumors and related cell lines such as HT-29 and HCT-116, 9-HSA is the only hydroxyfatty  constituent of branched fatty  esters of hydroxyfatty  (FAHFA), a novel family of lipids with anti-inflammatory properties. Importantly, FAHFA levels in tumors are elevated compared with normal tissue and, unlike 9-HSA, they do not induce apoptosis of colorectal cell lines over a wide range of concentrations. Further, the addition of 9-HSA to  cell lines augments the synthesis of different FAHFA before the cells commit to apoptosis, suggesting that FAHFA formation may function as a buffer system that sequesters the hydroxyacid into an inactive form, thereby restricting apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623369>Differential Mechanism of ATP Production Occurs in Response to Succinylacetone in  Cells.</a></h2><p>Our aim was to verify the potential ability of succinylacetone (SA) to inhibit mitochondrial function, thereby suppressing  cell proliferation. SA treatment caused apoptosis in HCT116 and HT29 cells, but not in SW480 cells, with mitochondria playing a key role. We checked for dysfunctional mitochondria after SA treatment. Mitochondria of HT29 cells were swollen, indicating damage, whereas in HCT116 cells, several mitochondria had a diminished size. Damaged mitochondria decreased ATP production and induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells. To understand SA-induced reduction in ATP production, we investigated the electron transfer chains (ETC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activity, which prevents the transfer of acetyl-CoA to the TCA (tricarboxylic ) cycle by inhibiting PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) activity. In each cell line, the inhibitory mechanism of ATP by SA was different. The activity of complex III consisting of the mitochondrial ETCs in HT29 cells was decreased. In contrast, PDH activity in HCT116 cells was reduced. Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT)-removing reactive oxygen species (ROS) was upregulated in HT29 cells, but not in HCT116 cells, indicating that in HT29 cells, a defense mechanism was activated against ROS.

In this study, VHLGYAT heptapeptide selected by phage display technique for HT-29 human  was investigated as homing peptide for drug delivery. Daunomycin was conjugated to the N-terminus of the peptide directly or through Cathepsin B cleavable spacers. Conjugates showed moderate in vitro cytostatic effect. Therefore, sequence modifications were performed by Ala-scan and positional scanning resulting in conjugates with much higher bioactivity. Conjugates in which Gly was replaced by amino  with bulky apolaric side chains provided the best efficacy. The influence of the cellular uptake, stability and drug release on the anti-tumour activity was investigated. It was found that mainly the difference in the cellular uptake of the conjugates generated the distinct effect on cell viability. One of the most efficient conjugate Dau = Aoa-LRRY-VHLFYAT-NH showed tumour growth inhibition on orthotopically developed HT-29  in mice with negligible toxic side effect compared to the free drug. We also indicate that this sequence is not specific to HT-29 cells, but it has a remarkable effect on many other  cells. Nevertheless, the Phe-containing conjugate was more active in all cases compared to the conjugate with the parent sequence.

The most common sources of human exposure to Al are food and beverages. The intestinal epithelium is the first barrier against Al-induced toxicity. In this study, HT-29, a human  cell line, was selected as an in vitro model to evaluate the Al-induced alteration in metabolomic profiles and explore the possible mechanisms of Al toxicity.MTT assay was performed to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of Al ions. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used for metabolomic analysis, and its results were further confirmed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) of nine selected genes.Al inhibited the growth of the HT-29 cells, and its half-maximal dose for the inhibition of cell proliferation was found to be four mM. This dose was selected for further metabolomic analysis, which revealed that 81 metabolites, such glutathione (GSH), phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and creatine, and 17 metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic  cycle, pyruvate metabolism, and GSH metabolism, were significantly altered after Al exposure. The RT-qPCR results further confirmed these findings.The metabolomics and RT-qPCR results indicate that the mechanisms of Al-induced cytotoxicity in HT-29 cells include cellular apoptosis, oxidative stress, and alteration of lipid, energy, and amino  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417300>ELR positive CXCL chemokines are highly expressed in an animal model of ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p> The presence of neutrophil-rich inflammation in  tissues of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the most important histological characteristics of this disease. However, the expression of CXCL chemokines governing the infiltration of neutrophils in UC has not been well elucidated.  In this experimental study, the UC model was induced in Wistar rats by administration of 2 mL 4% acetic  into the large  through the rectum. Animals were anesthetized after 48 hrs; their  tissue samples were isolated for macroscopic and histopathological examinations. The expression of CXCL family was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique.  Heavy infiltration of neutrophils, coagulation necrosis, and ulcers were observed in H&E staining, which pathologically proved the UC model. qRT-PCR results showed that ELR CXC chemokines such as CXCL6 and CXCL3 had the highest expression in the UC group, which was 49 and 28 times higher than that of the control group, respectively. In addition, other chemokines of this group including CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL7 had a significant increase compared to the control group (P≤0.05). However, ELR CXC chemokines such as CXCL4, CXCL13, and CXCL16 showed a smaller upregulation, while CXCL14 chemokine showed a significant decrease compared to the control group (P≤0.05).

In the present study, we investigated whether the DHA enclosed in RV-SLNs (DHA-RV-SLNs) could have the potential of attenuating irritation and inflammation caused by environmental factors at the skin level. To this aim, we used two keratinocyte lines (HaCaT and NCTC 2544 cells) and exposed them to the cytotoxic action of the surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), as an in vitro model of irritation, or to the pro-inflammatory activity of the cytokine TNF-α. We found that DHA enclosed in RV-SLNs significantly enhanced its ability to contrast the cytotoxic effect of SDS and to inhibit the SDS- and TNF-α-induced production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and 1 MCP-1, in the two keratinocyte cell lines, as well as the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, it more efficiently reduced the upsurge of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels obtained in the presence of a pro-oxidant (HO). Overall, our findings suggest the possibility that a sustained dietary supplementation with DHA-RV-SLNs could efficiently protect skin from the pro-irritant and pro-inflammatory activity of environmental attacks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31047058>Sodium thiosulfate enhances production of polysaccharides and anticancer activities of sulfated polysaccharides in Antrodia cinnamomea.</a></h2><p>Sulfated polysaccharides (SPSs) are polysaccharides (PSs) with high sulfate functionalization and possess bioactivities. This study aimed to increase the sulfate content of SPSs in Antrodia cinnamomea through sulfate feeding. Feeding A. cinnamomea with sodium thiosulfate was found to increase yields of PSs and SPSs in A. cinnamomea. The SPSs thus obtained (ST-SPS) were further isolated, showing enhanced sulfate content of 2.5 mmol/g. Sodium thiosulfate induced changes in molecular weight from 320 kDa to 1342 kDa, and area percentage of low-molecular-weight ST-SPS (< 20 kDa) was decreased. Functional studies revealed that sodium thiosulfate increased the ST-SPS anticancer efficacy in  cells via inhibition of EGFR/AKT signaling. Moreover, the ST-SPS enhanced synergistically cisplatin-, gefitinib- and 5 FU-induced cytotoxic effects in lung  H1975 cells and  CT26 cells.

Herein, we provide evidence that the immunosuppressive phenotype of TAMs is controlled by long-chain fatty  metabolism, specifically unsaturated fatty , here exemplified by oleate. Consequently, en-route enriched lipid droplets were identified as essential organelles, which represent effective targets for chemical inhibitors to block in vitro polarization of TAMs and tumor growth in vivo. In line, analysis of human tumors revealed that myeloid cells infiltrating  but not gastric  tissue indeed accumulate lipid droplets. Mechanistically, our data indicate that oleate-induced polarization of myeloid cells depends on the mammalian target of the rapamycin pathway. Thus, our findings reveal an alternative therapeutic strategy by targeting the pro-tumoral myeloid cells on a metabolic level.© 2019 The Authors.

Cell growth depends on the activation of receptors which bind growth factors and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors are among the most important ones. Usually, only small quantities of isolated receptors are available thus there is a need of suitable assay to study receptors glycosylation. Therefore, we developed a lectin-based reverse-phase protein microarray method for screening the glycosylation pattern of receptors in picomolar (pM) concentrations. The method was applied to glycoprofile IGF1 and IGF2 receptors and the solubilised membrane proteins isolated from tumour and non-tumour  tissue of patients with colorectal . We found that common to both receptors was partial overlapping of the major glycan structures with those present in the entire glycome of membrane proteins. In contrast, receptors possess higher level of α2,3 sialic  residues and lower level of tri-/tetra-antennary complex type N-glycans and terminal mannose in high-mannose structures. Increased levels of fucosylation and branched mannose structures were observed in both receptors derived from tumour tissue compared to non-tumour tissue. The described method enabling glycan analysis of receptors has a big application potential in e.g. biomarker research, biology and diagnostics.Copyright © 2019.

Also, a primary 5FU liposomal formulation with phosphatidyl choline (PC) exhibited higher cytotoxicity in murine  cells. In the present study, optimization of 5FU PC liposome, mechanism of cell death induction in human  cell lines and its safety along with other assays have been employed for targeted PC liposomes of 5FU. Liposomes were prepared using thin layer method and optimization of preparation was assessed using central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM). Folic  (FA) was employed as the targeting ligand. Morphology of 5FU loaded liposomes and changes in their thermal behavior were assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. In vitro cytotoxicity was explored using MTT assay in HT-29, Caco-2, HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines. Cytotoxicity mechanism of the targeted delivery system was searched through the evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψ), the release of cytochrome c, the activity of caspase 3/7 and apoptosis and necrosis rate. Liposomes were spherical in shape and 5FU was successfully encapsulated into liposomes rather in an amorphous state. Our interesting results showed that in HT-29 cells targeted liposomes triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, releasing of cytochrome c and promoting the substantial activity of caspase 3/7. In HeLa cells, however, targeted liposomes particularly activated necrosis pathway through the overproduction of ROS. Folate-liposomal 5FU showed significantly higher antitumor efficiency compared to free drug. The results of this study offer new prospects for  therapy with reducing systemic drug exposure and associated toxicities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Differences in cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle, invasion, and migration were measured between groups using MTT, flow cytometry, transwell and wound-healing assays, respectively. Western blotting was used to analyze relative protein expression levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), P21, and matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 and -9 between groups. Compared with the NC group, GA (low, middle and high) inhibited SW620 cell proliferation, invasion and migration (all P<0.05). Furthermore, there were significant differences in proliferation, invasion and migration between groups administered with different doses of GA (all P<0.05). Compared with the NC group, the expression levels of PI3K, AKT, phosphorylated-AKT, P21 and MMP-2 and -9 were significantly altered in a dose dependent manner following treatment with GA (all P<0.05).

In France, the prevalence of overweight in adults was 49% in 2015 (54% among men and 44% among women), including 17% of obese adults. According to the last evaluation performed by IARC in 2017, overweight and obesity are established risk factors for 13  sites with risk estimates per 5kg/m varying largely depending on the  site. In 2015 in France, 5.4% of  cases could be attributed to excess weight, corresponding to 18,600 cases, including 3400  cancers, 2600 kidney cancers, 4500 breast cancers and 2500 endometrial cancers. Obesity is also related to worse prognosis for some cancers, in particular breast and  cancers. Obesity in children and adolescents, also rising in many countries, has also been associated to an increase in adult  risk. A major cause of obesity is a disequilibrium in energy balance favoured by a diet rich in processed food, red meat, trans and saturated fatty , sweetened foods and beverages and poor in fruits and vegetables, legumes and whole grains. Main national and international recommendations to reduce the prevalence of obesity are to have a balanced diet and regular physical activity.Copyright © 2019 Société Française du .

Colibactin-producing gut microbes promote  tumour formation and enhance the progression of colorectal  via cellular senescence and death induced by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs); however, the chemical basis that contributes to the pathogenesis at the molecular level has not been fully characterized. Here, we report the discovery of colibactin-645, a macrocyclic colibactin metabolite that recapitulates the previously assumed genotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Colibactin-645 shows strong DNA DSB activity in vitro and in human cell cultures via a unique copper-mediated oxidative mechanism. We also delineate a complete biosynthetic model for colibactin-645, which highlights a unique fate of the aminomalonate-building monomer in forming the C-terminal 5-hydroxy-4-oxazolecarboxylic  moiety through the activities of both the polyketide synthase ClbO and the amidase ClbL.

However, Gba is a poor water-solube which hampered its clinical application. In this study, a pegylated liposomal Gba (PLGba) with HSPC/Cholesterol/mPEG-DSPE (56.2, 38.3, 5.3% molar ratio) was developed by the thin film hydration plus extrusion and calcium acetate gradient remote loading method, to address the issue of poor Gba solubility. Moreover, an integrin-targeting ligand (RGD peptide, cyclo[Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Tyr-Cys]) was post-inserted into liposomes in order to increase Gba cell delivery. Using fluorescently-labeled model liposomes, it was found that the targeting could improve the integrin-mediated cellular uptake of the liposomes in vitro in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and in vivo as evidenced by chicken chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis (CAM) model. It also could enrich the liposome accumulation in C26 tumor. Interestingly, co-treatment with PLGba and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD, also known as Doxil) had a synergistic and antagonistic antiproliferative effect on the C26 tumor cell line and the normal HUVEC, respectively.

However, molecular details of the underlying mechanism are largely unknown. Using a photoactivatable ceramide probe, we here identify the voltage-dependent anion channels VDAC1 and VDAC2 as mitochondrial ceramide binding proteins. Coarse-grain molecular dynamics simulations reveal that both channels harbor a ceramide binding site on one side of the barrel wall. This site includes a membrane-buried glutamate that mediates direct contact with the ceramide head group. Substitution or chemical modification of this residue abolishes photolabeling of both channels with the ceramide probe. Unlike VDAC1 removal, loss of VDAC2 or replacing its membrane-facing glutamate with glutamine renders human  cells largely resistant to ceramide-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our data support a role of VDAC2 as direct effector of ceramide-mediated cell death, providing a molecular framework for how ceramides exert their anti-neoplastic activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31328737>Development of EGFR-targeted evodiamine nanoparticles for the treatment of colorectal .</a></h2><p>Invasion and metastasis of colorectal  (CRC) are leading causes of death of CRC patients. Previous findings demonstrate that evodiamine (Evo), an indolequinone alkaloid, is effective in combating CRC; however, its poor aqueous solubility and low oral bioavailability limit its application in the prevention of invasion and metastasis of CRC. It is known that selectively targeting -specific receptors highly expressed on the surface of  cells by nanocarriers loaded with cytotoxic drugs is a viable strategy in nanobiotechnology to enhance  cell killing and minimize side effects. In this study, we report the development of a new class of nanotherapeutics: EGFR-targeting Evo-encapsulated poly(amino ) nanoparticles (GE11-Evo-NPs). These nanoparticles exhibited good aqueous solubility, slow release, and active targeting capability. Their inhibitory effect on human  cells and therapeutic efficacy against invasion and metastasis of CRC in nude mice were systematically investigated. Mechanisms of the GE11-Evo-NPs against EGFR mediated invasion and metastasis of CRC were also explored. Compared with free Evo, the GE11-Evo-NPs showed significantly increased cytotoxicity to  cells and potently inhibited CRC LoVo cell adhesion, invasion, and migration. The expression of EGFR, VEGF, and MMP proteins was dramatically down-regulated, which may partially account for their inhibition of invasion and metastasis of CRC. Moreover, in vivo studies show that the GE11-Evo-NPs exhibited much greater potency than other control groups in inhibiting CRC invasion and metastasis, tumor volume, and growth in nude mice, leading to a significantly prolonged tumor-bearing survival duration (P < 0.01).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014923>Proteomic analysis of flavokawain C-induced cell death in HCT 116  carcinoma cell line.</a></h2><p>Flavokawain C (FKC), a naturally occurring chalcone, has previously been shown to inhibit the growth of  carcinoma HCT 116 cells through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

The rs4806668G > T of the ribosomal protein gene RPL28 was associated with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival by 5 and 9 months (P = 0.002), with hazard ratios of 3.36 (P < 0.001) and 3.07 (P = 0.002), respectively. The rs4806668T allele was associated with an increased RPL28 expression in transverse normal  tissues (n = 246, P = 0.007). RPL28 expression was higher in colorectal tumors compared to paired normal tissues by up to 124% (P < 0.001) in three independent datasets. Metastatic cases with highest RPL28 tumor expression had a reduced survival in two datasets (n = 88, P = 0.009 and n = 56, P = 0.009). High RPL28 was further associated with changes in immunoglobulin and extracellular matrix pathways. Repression of RPL28 reduced proliferation by 1.4-fold to 5.6-fold (P < 0.05) in  HCT116 and HT-29 cells. Our findings suggest that the ribosomal RPL28 protein may influence mCRC outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530527>Anti- activity of Bifidobacterium metabolites on  cell line SW742.</a></h2><p>Bacteria species, which are used as probiotics, are lactic  bacteria. The majority of them are under the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. The aim of the present study was to isolate and identify Bifidobacterium and to evaluate the effects of their 24 h and 120 h cell-free supernatants (CFS) from both cultures on  cell line.In the present study, 84 samples of dairy products, infant feces, and probiotic capsule were collected, and Bifidobacterium was isolated. Gram stain, biochemical tests, and molecular identification were done for the isolation and identification of Bifidobacterium. Cytotoxicity effects of CFS derived from both cultures of isolated Bifidobacterium were assessed on  cell lines.In the present study, 17 isolates of Bifidobacterium were identified. The results show that Bifidobacterium was most frequently associated with infant feces and dairy products, whereas the lowest rate was associated with local milk. After the effects of CFS on  cell line, two isolates were identified from infant feces and probiotic capsule; they had the highest ability in inhibiting the growth of  cells. Bifidobacterium bifidum was effective in combating  cells and was associated with a substantial improvement in gastrointestinal .The study has shown that the regular ingested probiotics could prevent the development of colorectal . During the present study, the produced CFS could inhibit the growth of  cells. In conclusion, probiotics have good potential to be introduced as a new approach to  treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078780>Impairment of HIF-1α-mediated metabolic adaption by NRF2-silencing in breast  cells.</a></h2><p>Hypoxia, a common element in the tumor environment, leads to Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) stabilization to modulate cellular metabolism as an adaptive response. In a previous study, we showed that inhibition of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-like-2 (NFE2L2; NRF2), a master regulator of many genes coping with electrophilic and oxidative stress, elevated the level of miR-181c and induced mitochondrial dysfunction in  cells. In this study, we demonstrate that NRF2-silencing hindered HIF-1α accumulation in hypoxic breast  cells and subsequently suppressed hypoxia-inducible expression of glycolysis-associated glucose transporter-1, hexokinase-2, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1, and lactate dehydrogenase A. HIF-1α dysregulation in NRF2-silenced  cells was associated with miR-181c elevation. Overexpression of miR-181c in breast  cells blocked HIF-1α accumulation and diminished hypoxia-inducible levels of glycolysis enzymes, whereas the inhibition of miR-181c in NRF2-silenced cells restored HIF-1α accumulation. In a subsequent metabolomic analysis, hypoxic incubation increased the levels of metabolites involved in glycolysis and activated the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in control cells. However, these elevations were less pronounced in NRF2-silenced cells. In particular, hypoxic incubation increased the levels of amino , which implies a shift to catabolic metabolism, and the increased levels were higher in control cells than in NRF2-silenced cells. Concurrently, hypoxia activated BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3)-mediated autophagy in the control cells and miR-181c was found to be involved in this autophagy activation. Taken together, these results show that hypoxia-induced metabolic changes to glycolysis, the PPP, and autophagy are inhibited by NRF2-silencing through miR-181c-mediated HIF-1α dysregulation. Therefore, targeting NRF2/miR-181c could be an effective strategy to counteract HIF-1α-orchestrated metabolic adaptation of hypoxic  cells.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Most enhancing effects are described for ω-3 PUFAs EPA and DHA; less evidence is available with the intermediate DPA. We studied the chemotherapy enhancing effects of EPA, DPA and DHA in murine  C26 adenocarcinoma cells and showed that DPA displayed similar chemosensitizing effects as EPA. Moreover, EPA supplementation increased cellular DPA content. In a C26 tumor-bearing mouse model, we studied the incorporation of ω-3 PUFA in tumor and skeletal muscle after a diet with different ω-3 PUFA sources. Although little DPA was present in the fatty  food sources, in those that contained considerable EPA concentrations, DPA levels were higher in tumor and muscle tissue. From these studies, we conclude that EPA and DPA show chemosensitizing effects and that intake of EPA or EPA-containing nutrition leads to increased cellular DPA content by elongation. These findings support the use of ω-3 PUFA containing nutritional supplementations in  patients during chemotherapy treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616028>Traditional Processed Meat Products Re-designed Towards Inulin-rich Functional Foods Reduce Polyps in Two Colorectal  Animal Models.</a></h2><p>Inulin-rich foods exert a prebiotic effect, as this polysaccharide is able to enhance beneficial  microbiota populations, giving rise to the in situ production of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) such as propionic and butyric . These SCFAs are potent preventive agents against colorectal  due to their histone deacetylases inhibitory properties, which induce apoptosis in tumor colonocytes. As colorectal  is the fourth most common neoplasia in Europe with 28.2 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants, a cost-effective preventive strategy has been tested in this work by redesigning common porcine meat products (chorizo sausages and cooked ham) consumed by a substantial proportion of the population towards potential colorectal  preventive functional foods. In order to test the preventive effect of these inulin-rich meat products against colorectal , an animal model (Rattus norvegicus F344) was used, involving two doses of azoxymethane (10 mg/kg) and two treatments with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) during a 20-week assay period. Control feed, control sausages, functional sausages (15.7% inulin), control cooked ham and functional cooked ham (10% inulin) were used to feed the corresponding animal cohorts. Then, the animals were sacrificed and their digestive tract tissues were analyzed. The results showed a statistically significant 49% reduction in the number of  polyps in the functional meat products cohorts with respect to the control meat products animals, as well as an increase in the cecum weight (an indicator of a diet rich in prebiotic fiber), a 51.8% increase in  propionate production, a 39.1% increase in  butyrate concentrations, and a reduction in the number of hyperplastic Peyer's patches. Metagenomics studies also demonstrated  microbiota differences, revealing a significant increase in Bacteroidetes populations in the functional meat products (mainly due to an increase in Bacteroidaceae and Prevotellaceae families, which include prominent propionate producers), together with a reduction in Firmicutes (especially due to lower Lachnospiraceae populations). However, functional meat products showed a remarkable increase in the anti-inflammatory and fiber-fermentative Blautia genus, which belongs to this Lachnospiraceae family. The functional meat products cohorts also presented a reduction in important pro-inflammatory bacterial populations, such as those of the genus Desulfovibrio and Bilophila. These results were corroborated in a genetic animal model of CRC (F344/NSlc-Apc) that produced similar results. Therefore, processed meat products can be redesigned towards functional prebiotic foods of interest as a cost-effective dietary strategy for preventing colorectal  in human populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31036835>A library of Neo Open Reading Frame peptides (NOPs) as a sustainable resource of common neoantigens in up to 50% of  patients.</a></h2><p>Somatic mutations in  can result in neoantigens against which patients can be vaccinated. The quest for tumor specific neoantigens has yielded no targets that are common to all tumors, yet foreign to healthy cells. Single base pair substitutions (SNVs) at best can alter 1 amino  which can result in a neoantigen; with the exception of rare site-specific oncogenic driver mutations (such as RAS) such mutations are private. Here, we describe a source of common neoantigens induced by frame shift mutations, based on analysis of 10,186 TCGA tumor samples. We find that these frame shift mutations can produce long neoantigens. These are completely new to the body, and indeed recent evidence suggests that frame shifts can be highly immunogenic. We report that many different frame shift mutations converge to the same small set of 3' neo open reading frame peptides (NOPs), all encoded by the Neo-ORFeome. We find that a fixed set of only 1,244 neo-peptides in as much as 30% of all TCGA  patients. For some tumor classes this is higher; e.g. for  and cervical , peptides derived from only ten genes (saturated at 90 peptides) can be applied to 39% of all patients. 50% of all TCGA patients can be achieved at saturation (using all those peptides in the library found more than once). A pre-fabricated library of vaccines (peptide, RNA or DNA) based on this set can provide off the shelf, quality certified, 'personalized' vaccines within hours, saving months of vaccine preparation. This is crucial for critically ill  patients with short average survival expectancy after diagnosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519566>High Sensitivity to Cholic -induced  Tumorigenesis Makes Female PIRC Rats (F344/NTac-Apc) a Suitable Model for Studying CRC-promoting Agents.</a></h2><p>Rats of the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc)-mutated female polyposis in rat (PIRC) (F344/NTac-Apc) model exhibit a low level of intestinal tumorigenesis and are thus potentially exploitable as a model for identifying substances increasing colorectal  (CRC).To test this possibility, we treated such rats with the bile  (BA) cholic  (CA) (0.3% w/w in the diet), known to promote CRC, and assessed tumorigenesis.Precancerous  lesions (mucin-depleted foci) and intestinal tumors were dramatically increased in CA-treated rats compared to controls (p<0.01).  mucosa proliferation was higher and apoptosis lower than those in controls. Expression of nuclear receptor 1h4 (Nr1h4) gene [encoding for BA receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR)], organic solute transporter beta (Ostb) and fatty -binding protein 6 (Fabp6), FXR-dependent BA transporters, were dramatically down-regulated in CA-treated rats.CA-increased tumorigenesis in female PIRC rats, with mechanisms involving increased proliferation, reduced apoptosis and marked down-regulation of genes controlling BA homeostasis. Since BAs have been implicated in CRC, we suggest that female PIRC rats can be used to identify CRC-promoting agents.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

In contrast to immunocompetent hosts, kidney transplant recipients often show atypical presentation and course of the disease impeding diagnosis. Especially extrapulmonary or disseminated infection is more frequent and can resemble malignant processes. However, reactivation of tuberculosis mostly develops within the early post-transplant course, whereas malignancies are predominantly long-term complications. We report a case of disseminated abdominal tuberculosis developing 10 years after kidney transplantation and review the underlying literature.A 51-year-old lady presented with epigastric pain, diarrhea, weight loss and night sweats 10 years after deceased-donor kidney transplantation. An epigastric as well as multiple peritoneal masses were found suspicious of a  of unknown primary. Colonoscopy revealed a  tumor with the biopsy showing no dysplasia but histiocytic and granulomatous infiltration with -fast bacilli. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected in the biopsy and stool and disseminated abdominal tuberculosi was diagnosed.With anti-tuberculosis therapy, the masses regressed, and all cultures became sterile, sparing graft function.This case emphasizes how variable and unspecific the presentation of tuberculosis in kidney transplant recipients may be and that tuberculosis constitutes a relevant risk also in the long-term post-transplant course.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31395908>Nanoencapsulated betulinic  analogue distinctively improves colorectal carcinoma in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Betulinic , a plant secondary metabolite, has gained significant attention due to its antiproliferative activity over a range of  cells.

The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT or TERT) also plays an important role in colorectal  growth, conferring sustained cell proliferation and survival. Although hTERT induces COX-2 expression in gastric and cervical , their interaction has not been investigated in the context of CRC.COX-2, PGE levels, and telomerase activity were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and TRAP assay in 49 colorectal  samples. PTGS1, PTGS2, PTGES3, TERT mRNA, and protein levels were investigated using RNA-seq and antibody-based protein profiling data from the TCGA and HPA projects. A multi-omics comparison was performed between PTGS2 and TERT, using RNAseq, DNA methylation, copy number variations (CNVs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and insertions/deletions (Indels) data.COX-2 expression was positive in 40/49 CRCs, bearing cytoplasmic and heterogeneous staining, from moderate to high intensity. COX-2 staining was mainly detected in the stroma of the tumor cells and the adjacent normal tissues. PGE expression was lower in CRC compared to the adjacent normal tissue, and inversely correlated to telomerase activity in right  cancers. COX-1 and COX-2 were anticorrelated with TERT. Isoform structural analysis revealed the most prevalent transcripts driving the differential expression of PTGS1, PTGS2, PTGES3, and TERT in CRC. COX-2 expression was significantly higher among B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase, mutant (BRAF) tumors. Kirsten ras oncogene (KRAS) mutations did not affect COX-2 or TERT expression. The promoter regions of COX-2 and TERT were reversely methylated.Our data support that COX-2 is involved in the early stages of colorectal  development, initially affecting the tumor's stromal microenvironment, and, subsequently, the epithelial cells. They also highlight an inverse correlation between COX-2 expression and telomerase activity in CRC, as well as differentially methylated patterns within the promoter regions of COX-2 and TERT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31372348>Natural combination of phenolic glycosides from fruits resists pro-oxidant insults to  cells and enhances intrinsic antioxidant status in mice.</a></h2><p>A combination of fresh fruits adequately supplying required nutrients is likely to have better health benefits by virtue of the synergistic/additive effect of its natural constituents. With this view and aiming to obtain phenolic glycosides in combination, fresh apple, grape, orange, pomegranate, and sapota fruit juices were combined and lyophilized. An aqueous extract of this fruit combination (AEFC) had polyphenols as a major constituent (47.36 μg GAE/mL) and LC-MS analysis documented the presence of cyanidin and pallidol 3-O-glucosides, phloridzin, delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside, kaempferol-3-O-pentoside, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, trans-caffeic . Corroborating this, AEFC exhibited significant DPPH and superoxide radical scavenging activities (ICvalues 43.63 and 49.01 μg/mL) and protected  epithelial cells (HCT-15) against HO and AAPH induced cell death by 40 and 72.62% and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) induced GSH depletion by 52.43%.

Understanding the biological processes responsible for the development and progression of colorectal  could aid the development of new diagnostic and treatment approaches. We used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis to measure metabolite levels in pairs of colorectal  tissue samples and samples of the adjacent macroscopically normal mucosal tissue from 10  patients. Regarding nucleotide metabolomic intermediates, the colorectal  tissue contained lower levels of ribulose 5-phosphate and higher levels of xanthine, adenine, and hypoxanthine than the normal tissue. The levels of antioxidant metabolites, such as sulfur-containing amino , were also significantly higher in the colorectal  tissue. The level of tryptophan was decreased, and the levels of molecules downstream of the tryptophan pathway, such as kynurenine and quinolinic , which protect colorectal  against the host's immune system and function in de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthesis, were increased in the colorectal  tissue. The colorectal  tissue samples also contained higher levels of lysophospholipids and fatty , especially stearic  and polyunsaturated fatty , including arachidonic  and docosahexaenoic .

The aim of this study was to determine whether high-amylose potato starch (HAPS), high-amylose maize starch (HAMS), and butyrylated high-amylose maize starch (HAMSB)-produced by an organocatalytic route-could oppose the negative effects of a high-protein meat diet (HPM), in terms of fermentation pattern, cecal microbial composition, and  biomarkers of CRC. Rats were fed a HPM diet or an HPM diet where 10% of the maize starch was substituted with either HAPS, HAMS, or HAMSB, for 4 weeks. Feces, cecum digesta, and  tissue were obtained for biochemical, microbial, gene expression (oncogenic microRNA), and immuno-histochemical (O-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine (OMeG) adduct) analysis. The HAMS and HAMSB diets shifted the fecal fermentation pattern from protein towards carbohydrate metabolism. The HAMSB diet also substantially increased fecal butyrate concentration and the pool, compared with the other diets. All three RS treatments altered the cecal microbial composition in a diet specific manner. HAPS and HAMSB showed CRC preventive effects, based on the reduced  oncogenic miR17-92 cluster miRNA expression, but there was no significant diet-induced differences in the  OMeG adduct levels.

Herein, the synthesis of four homoleptic metal complexes with diacetylcurcumin (DAC), using a ligand designed to prevent the interaction of phenolic groups, rendering metal complexes through the β-diketone functionality, is reported. Due to their physiological relevance, we used bivalent magnesium, zinc, copper, and manganese for complexation with DAC. The resulting products were characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), fluorescence spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy (IR), liquid and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), magnetic moment, mass spectrometry (MS), single crystal, and powder X-ray diffraction (SCXRD and PXRD). Crystallization was achieved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or dimethylformamide (DMF) as triclinic systems with space group P-1, showing the metal bound to the β-diketone function, while the H-NMR confirmed the preference of the enolic form of the ligand. Single crystal data demonstrated a 1:2 metal:ligand ratio. The inhibition of lipid peroxidation was evaluated using the thiobarbituric  reactive substance assay (TBARS). All four metal complexes (Mg, Zn, Cu, and Mn) exhibited good antioxidant effect (IC = 2.03 ± 0.27, 1.58 ± 0.07, 1.58 ± 0.15 and 1.24 ± 0.10 μM respectively) compared with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and α-tocopherol.

Colorectal adenomatous polyps are at high risk for the development of CRC. In this report, we described the metabolic changes in the sera from patients with colorectal polyps and CRC by using the NMR-based metabolomics. 110 serum samples were collected from patients and healthy controls, including 40 CRC patients, 32 colorectal polyp patients, and 38 healthy controls. The metabolic profiles and differential metabolites of sera were analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis (MSA), including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) methods. A total of 23 differential metabolites were identified from MSA. According to the pathway analysis and multivariate ROC curve-based exploratory analysis by using the relative concentrations of differential metabolites, we found abnormal metabolic pathways and potential biomarkers involved with the colorectal polyp and CRC. The results showed that the pyruvate metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism were activated in colorectal polyps. And the glycolysis and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were activated in CRC. The changed metabolism may promote cellular proliferation. In addition, we found that the rates of acetate/glycerol and lactate/citrate could be the potential biomarkers in colorectal polyp and CRC, respectively.

We hypothesize that molecules and adipocytokines generated from the adipose tissue of obese individuals accentuate the effect on the metabolic reprogramming in  cells, i.e. induce disarray in energy metabolism networks of the targeted affected  epithelial cells, prompting their malignant phenotype.To explore the mechanistic behind this crosstalk we conducted a co-culture model system using human  cells having different malignant abilities and adipocytes from different depots and subjects.The results demonstrate that co-culturing aggressive  cells such as HM-7 cells, with Visceral or Subcutaneous adipocytes (VA or SA respectively) from lean/obese subjects significantly up-regulate the secretion of the adipokines IL-8, MCP1, and IL-6 from the adipocytes. Surprisingly, the response of co-culturing HM-7 cells with obese SA was substantially more significant. In addition, these effects were significantly more pronounced when using HM-7 cells as compared to the less malignant HCT116  cells. Moreover, the results showed that HM-7 cells, co-cultured with VA or SA from obese subjects, expressed higher levels of fatty  binding protein 4; thus, the conditioned media obtained from the wells contained HM-7 cells and adipocytes from obese subjects was significantly more efficient in promoting invasion of HM-7 cells.We conclude that interaction between adipocytes and  cells, especially the highly malignant cells, results in metabolic alterations in  cells and in highly hypertrophy phenotype which characterized by increasing adipokines secretion from the adipocytes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The existence of neutrophil-rich inflammation in  tissues of patients with UC is one of the most significant histological features of this disease. Nonetheless, the expression of CXCR chemokine receptors which appear as the main chemical mediators governing the migration of neutrophils into the mucosal tissue of patients with UC has not been well clarified.In this experimental study, the UC model was induced in Wistar rats by administration of 2 ml 4% acetic  into the large  through the rectum. Animals were anesthetized after 48 h; their  tissue samples were isolated for macroscopic and histopathological examination. The expression of receptor of CXC chemokine was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique.Heavy infiltration of neutrophils, coagulative necrosis, and ulcers were observed in H and E staining, which pathologically proved the UC model. qRT-PCR results indicated that CXCR2 as one of the important ELR chemokine family receptors bears the highest expression in the UC group (32 fold) than the control group ( ≤ 0.05). In addition, other CXCRs of this group including CXCR1 did not possess any change ( > 0.05). In contrast, RLR negative chemokine family receptors did not show any changes with the normal group.The results showed that CXCR2 is the only receptor for CXCL family which was remarkably upregulated in experimental UC and that CXCR2 might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC.Copyright: © 2019 Advanced Biomedical Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557619>Long Non-coding RNA ITIH4-AS1 Accelerates the Proliferation and Metastasis of Colorectal  by Activating JAK/STAT3 Signaling.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence has uncovered long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as central regulators in the pathogenesis of diverse human cancers including colorectal  (CRC). The present study discovered that a novel lncRNA ITIH4 antisense RNA 1 (ITHI4-AS1) was frequently under-expressed in most normal human tissues, including  tissues. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of ITHI4-AS1 in CRC. Interestingly, a significant overexpression of ITIH4-AS1 was observed in CRC cell lines relative to normal NCM460 cells. Also, we investigated the facilitating role of ITIH4-AS1 in CRC cell growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we explained that ITIH4-AS1 upregulation in CRC was attributed to downregulation or even depletion of RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST), a presently identified transcriptional repressor for ITIH4-AS1. Meanwhile, the contribution of ITIH4-AS1 to CRC development was validated to rely on the activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway. More importantly, we verified that FUS interacted with both ITIH4-AS1 and STAT3, and that ITIH4-AS1 evoked nuclear translocation of phosphorylated (p)-STAT3 in CRC through recruiting FUS. In summary, our findings unveiled for the first time that REST downregulation-enhanced ITIH4-AS1 exerts pro-tumor functions in CRC through FUS-dependent activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway, implying that targeting ITIH4-AS1 may be a novel effective strategy for CRC therapy.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Leu enters cells via the Leu transporter LAT1-4F2hc (LAT1). Here we show that the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter NKCC1 (SLC12A2), a known regulator of cell volume, is present in complex with LAT1. We further show that NKCC1 depletion or deletion enhances LAT1 activity, as well as activation of Akt and Erk, leading to activation of mTORC1 in cells,  organoids, and mouse . Moreover, NKCC1 depletion reduces intracellular Na concentration and cell volume (size) and mass and stimulates cell proliferation. NKCC1, therefore, suppresses mTORC1 by inhibiting its key activating signaling pathways. Importantly, by linking ion transport and cell volume regulation to mTORC1 function, NKCC1 provides a long-sought link connecting cell volume (size) to cell mass regulation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Sixty-eight patients with CRC were enrolled in the study, of which 33 patients with synchronous metastasis. Fatty  profile analysis in tissue samples was done to examine the levels of AA and EPA. High levels of the AA/EPA ratio were detected in tumor tissue of patients with metastatic CRC.

Claudin7, a CIC-biomarker in gastrointestinal tumors, is recovered in TEX. Recent evidence suggesting individual cells delivering distinct microvesicles became of particular interest for claudin7, which is part of tight junctions (TJ) and glycolipid-enriched membrane domains (GEM), GEM-located claudin7 is palmitoylated. This offered the unique possibility of exploring the contribution of a CIC marker and its origin from distinct membrane domains on CIC-TEX biogenesis and activities. Proteome and miRNA analysis of wild-type, claudin7-knockdown and a rescue with claudin7 harboring a mutated palmitoylation site (mP) of a rat pancreatic and a human  line uncovered significant, only partly overlapping contributions of palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated claudin7 to TEX composition. Palmitoylated claudin7 facilitates GEM-integrated plasma membrane and associated signaling molecule recruitment; non-palmitoylated claudin7 supports recruitment of trafficking components, proteins engaged in fatty  metabolism and TJ proteins into TEX. Claudin7mP also assists TEX recovery of selected miRNA. Thus, distinctly located claudin7 affects CIC-TEX composition and TJ-derived cld7 might play a unique role in equipping CIC-TEX with transporters and lipid metabolism-regulating molecules, awareness of distinct TEX populations being crucial facing therapeutic translation.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31004301>Cytotoxicity screening of supercritical fluid extracted seaweeds and phenylpropanoids.</a></h2><p>Detached leaves of Posidonia oceanica and Zostera marina creating nuisance at the shores were extracted by means of supercritical CO enriched with a co-solvent, compared with that of soxhlet extraction.

Addition of seven nucleotides at the 3' ends of the miR or miR* strand resulted in a thermodynamic asymmetry at either of the two ends, which resulted in selective RISC recruitment, as demonstrated by a stem-loop PCR experiment. Such selective recruitment was also corroborated at the protein level by western blot analysis. To investigate the functional effect because of selective recruitment, we performed apoptosis and metastasis studies using human  carcinoma cells (HCT116) and human osteosarcoma cells (MG63). These experiments indicated that recruitment of the miR strand is responsible for inducing apoptosis and inhibiting the invasiveness of  cells. Recruitment of the miR* strand, on the other hand, had the opposite effect. To the best of our knowledge, our strand engineering strategy is the first report of improved strand selection of a desired miRNA strand by RISC without using any chemical modifications or mismatches. We believe that such structural modifications of miR34a could mitigate some of the off-target effects of miRNA therapy and would also allow a better understanding of sequence-specific gene regulation.

Short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and are produced in large quantities by  bacteria that produce SCFAs by fermenting fiber. We assessed whether there was an association between fecal SCFA concentrations and the presence of  adenomas or carcinomas in a cohort of individuals using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic shotgun sequence data. We measured the fecal concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate within the cohort and found that there were no significant associations between SCFA concentration and tumor status. When we incorporated these concentrations into random forest classification models trained to differentiate between people with healthy colons and those with adenomas or carcinomas, we found that they did not significantly improve the ability of 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence-based models to classify individuals. Finally, we generated random forest regression models trained to predict the concentration of each SCFA based on 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence data from the same samples. These models performed poorly and were able to explain at most 14% of the observed variation in the SCFA concentrations. These results support the broader epidemiological data that questions the value of fiber consumption for reducing the risks of colorectal . Although other bacterial metabolites may serve as biomarkers to detect adenomas or carcinomas, fecal SCFA concentrations have limited predictive power. Considering that colorectal  is the third leading -related cause of death within the United States, it is important to detect colorectal tumors early and to prevent the formation of tumors. Short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) are often used as a surrogate for measuring gut health and for being anticarcinogenic because of their anti-inflammatory properties. We evaluated the fecal SCFA concentrations of a cohort of individuals with different  tumor burdens who were previously analyzed to identify microbiome-based biomarkers of tumors. We were unable to find an association between SCFA concentration and tumor burden or use SCFAs to improve our microbiome-based models of classifying people based on their tumor status. Furthermore, we were unable to find an association between the fecal community structure and SCFA concentrations. Our results indicate that the association between fecal SCFAs, the gut microbiome, and tumor burden is weak.Copyright © 2019 Sze et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31137456>Dietary Walnut Supplementation Alters Mucosal Metabolite Profiles During DSS-Induced  Ulceration.</a></h2><p>Walnuts contain a complex array of natural compounds and phytochemicals that exhibit a wide range of health benefits, including protection against inflammation and .

These binding events are important in understanding membrane signaling and drug interactions. To probe ligand-receptor binding, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) tags are a promising tool. SERS tags are plasmonic nanostructures functionalized with a protective coating, a Raman reporter molecule, and a biorecognition element.

Moreover, administration of DOPS effectively preserved the intestinal barrier function via reducing the loss of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in adjacent tissues and carcinomatous tissues. Further studies demonstrated that DOPS improved the metabolic ability of tumor infiltrated CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and reduced the expression of PD-1 on CTLs to enhance the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironments (TME).

The mechanism by which palmitoylcarnitine induces  cell death is unclear. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationship between mitochondrial kinetics and glutathione buffering in determining the effect of palmitoylcarnitine on cell survival. HT29 and HCT 116 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, CCD 841 non-transformed  cells and MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells were exposed to 0μM, 50μM and 100μM palmitoylcarnitine for 24-48 hours. HCT 116 and HT29 cells showed decreased cell survival following palmitoylcarnitine compared to CCD 841 cells. Palmitoylcarnitine stimulated HO emission in HT29 and CCD 841 cells but increased it to a greater level in HT29 cells due largely to a higher basal HO emission. This greater HO emission was associated with lower glutathione buffering capacity and caspase-3 activation in HT29 cells. The glutathione depleting agent, buthionine sulfoximine, sensitized CCD 841 cells and further sensitized HT29 cells to palmitoylcarnitine-induced decreases in cell survival. MCF7 cells did not produce HO when exposed to palmitoylcarnitine and were able to maintain glutathione levels. Furthermore, HT29 cells demonstrated the lowest mitochondrial oxidative kinetics vs CCD 841 and MCF7 cells. The results demonstrate that colorectal  is sensitive to palmitoylcarnitine due in part to an inability to prevent oxidative stress through glutathione-redox coupling thereby rendering the cells sensitive to elevations in HO. These findings suggest that the relationship between inherent metabolic capacities and redox regulation is altered early in response to palmitoylcarnitine.</p></html>
