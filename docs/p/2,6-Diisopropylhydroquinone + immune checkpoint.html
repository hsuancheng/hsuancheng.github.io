Our aim was to assess this combined therapy on both radiated and non-radiated bladder tumors and to characterize the  landscape within the tumor microenvironment. Murine bladder cancer cells (MB49) were injected s.c. in both flanks of C57BL/6 mice. Mice were randomly assigned to the following treatments: placebo, antiPD-L1 (4 intra-peritoneal injections over  weeks), radiation to right flank (10Gy in two fractions), or radiation+anti-PD-L1. Tumor digestion, flow cytometry, and qPCR were performed. Log-rank analysis was used for statistical significance. Radiation+antiPD-L1 group demonstrated statistically significant slower tumor growth rate both in the radiated and non-irradiated tumors (p<0.001). Survival curves demonstrated superior survival in the combination group compared to each treatment alone (p=0.02). Flow cytometry showed increased infiltration of immuno-suppressive cells as well as cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) in the radiation and combination groups (p=0.04). Ratio of immunosuppressive cells to CTL shifted in favor of cytotoxic activity in the combination arm (p<0.001). The qPCR analysis revealed downregulation of immunosuppressive genes (CCL22, IL22 and IL13), as well as upregulation of markers of CTL activation (CXCL9, GZMA and GZMB) within both the radiated and distant tumors within the combination group. Combining radiation with   inhibitor provided better response in the radiated tumors and also the distant tumors along with a shift within the tumor microenvironment favoring cytotoxic activity. These findings demonstrate a possible abscopal effect in urothelial carcinoma with combination therapy.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466582>Systemic Therapies for Advanced Melanoma.</a></h2><p>The incidence of metastatic melanoma continues to increase each decade.

The influence of such mutations on anti-tumor immunity in prostate cancer, however, is largely unknown. To better understand the correlation between BRCA1/ mutations and the  phenotype in prostate cancer, we characterized the  infiltrate of eight BRCA2-mutated tumors in comparison with eight BRCA1/ wild-type patients by T- receptor sequencing and immunohistochemistry for CD45, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, and CD163. In addition, we analyzed seven prostate cancer biopsies that were either BRCA2 or ATM-mutated in comparison with wild-type tumors. Whereas in BRCA1/ wild-type tumors,  cells were found predominantly extratumorally, most BRCA2-mutated tumors including one biopsy showed a significantly increased intratumoral   infiltration. The ratio of intratumoral to extratumoral  cells was considerably higher in BRCA2-mutated tumors for all markers and reached statistical significance for CD4 (p = 0.007), CD8 (p = 0.006), and FOXP3 (p = 0.001). However, the intratumoral CD8 to FOXP3 ratio showed a trend to be lower in BRCA2-mutated tumors suggesting a more suppressed tumor  microenvironment. Our findings provide a rationale for the future use of  oncological approaches in BRCA2-mutated prostate cancer and may encourage efforts to target immunosuppressive T- populations to prime tumors for immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518074>Endocrine-related adverse events associated with - inhibitors in patients with melanoma.</a></h2><p>- inhibitors have been shown to improve survival in melanoma patients, but can also trigger -related endocrinopathies, especially hypophysitis and thyroid dysfunction.To assess the incidence and the spectrum of endocrinopathies in melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy a prospective observational study was conducted. Forty out of 339 patients, treated with - inhibitors, developed endocrinopathies. All patients had hormonal functional tests at screening (before the initiation of immunotherapy) and during follow-up.The total incidence of endocrinopathies was 11.8%, 13.4% due to anti-PD1/PDL1, 5% due to anti-CTLA4, and 18.5% due to sequential and/or combination treatment. Twenty-one patients (6.%) presented with isolated anterior hypophysitis, eleven (3.%) with primary thyroid dysfunction and eight (.4%) with both abnormalities. The most frequent anterior pituitary hormone deficiency was central adrenal insufficiency, followed by central hypothyroidism and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. None of the patients with corticotroph axis failure recovered during follow-up. Endocrinopathies occurred after a median of 22 weeks (range: 4-156) from treatment initiation. Of note, sequential and/or combination therapy with anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1/anti-PDL1 led to an almost threefold incidence of hypophysitis compared to either monotherapy. Only one of 120 patients receiving anti-CTLA4 monotherapy developed primary hypothyroidism.Our cohort demonstrated an increased incidence of hypophysitis with anti-PD1/anti-PDL1 in contrast to the rarity of primary thyroid dysfunction with anti-CTLA4 treatment. These results could be attributed to genetic/ethnic differences. Sequential treatment is, for the first time to our knowledge, reported to increase the risk of developing hypophysitis to a level as high as that of combination therapy.© 2019 The Authors.

The aim of this work was to evaluate several biomarkers as predictors of response to nivolumab monotherapy in patients with non-small- lung cancer.Blood samples was collected at baseline, at  months after treatment start, and at disease progression. Lactate dehydrogenase level (LDH), neutrophils, and leukocyte values were obtained from medical record. Interleukin (IL)-8, IL-11, and kynurenine/tryptophan levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Total protein was extracted from circulating CD8+ T cells, and BCL- interacting mediator of  death (BIM) protein expression tested by western blotting.Baseline LDH levels were significantly higher in non-responder patients than in those who responded (P = .045). The increase in indoleamine ,3 dioxygenase activity was related to progression of disease, mainly in patients who did not respond to nivolumab treatment (P = .001). Increased levels of circulating IL-8 were observed in initially responding patients at time of progression, and it was related to lower overall survival (hazard ratio, 7.49; P = .025). A highest expression of BIM in circulating CD8+ T cells could be related to clinical benefit. The Student t test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare groups for continuous variables. Time to events was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by the log-rank test.Changes in plasma LDH and IL-8, indoleamine ,3 dioxygenase activity, and BIM expression in CD8+ T cells could be used to monitor and predict clinical benefit from nivolumab treatment in these patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Pharmacodynamic effects relative to copanlisib dose and plasma exposure were evaluated. Patients with lymphoma or solid tumors received copanlisib 0.4 mg/kg or 0.8 mg/kg on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day . Primary variables were maximum changes in phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) levels in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and plasma glucose. Other evaluations included PI3K signaling markers and T-lymphocytes in paired tumor biopsies, the relationship between estimated plasma exposure and pharmacodynamic markers, response, and safety. Sixty-three patients received copanlisib. PRP pAKT levels showed sustained reductions from baseline following copanlisib (median inhibition: 0.4 mg/kg, 73.8% [range -94.9 to 144.0]; 0.8 mg/kg, 79.6% [range -96.0 to 408.0]). Tumor pAKT was reduced vs. baseline with copanlisib 0.8 mg/kg in paired biopsy samples (P < 0.05). Dose-related transient plasma glucose elevations were observed. Estimated copanlisib plasma exposure significantly correlated with changes in plasma pAKT and glucose metabolism markers. There were  complete responses and 6 partial responses; 7 of 8 responders received copanlisib 0.8 mg/kg. Adverse events (all grade) included hyperglycemia (52.4%), fatigue (46.0%), and hypertension (41.3%). Copanlisib demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacodynamic evidence of target engagement and PI3K pathway modulation/inhibition in tumor and  cells. Results support the use of copanlisib 0.8 mg/kg (or flat-dose equivalent of 60 mg) in solid tumors and lymphoma, and provide a biomarker hypothesis for studies of copanlisib combined with   inhibitors ().Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567703>Sarcoid-like Reaction Discovered on EBUS-TBNA of Intrathoracic Lymph Nodes During Immunotherapy for Metastatic Melanoma.</a></h2><p>The use of   inhibitors has dramatically improved outcomes for patients with advanced melanoma and other malignancies.  inhibitors are associated with a unique set of toxicities collectively known as -related adverse events, the incidence of which is rising in parallel with their increasing use in clinical practice. -related adverse events are widely variable in their presentation and can affect virtually any organ system in the body. Sarcoid-like reactions in patients being treated with   inhibitors are rare and are typically multisystemic in nature with isolated pulmonary involvement representing only a small minority of cases reported in the literature. Herein we describe  patients who developed progressively enlarging lymphadenopathy while receiving  inhibitors for metastatic melanoma. Both patients were initially noted to have an excellent clinical response to immunotherapy but their treatment was interrupted pending further investigation as they were suspected to have progressive disease. They were ultimately diagnosed with sarcoid-like reactions after an endobronchial ultrasound-guided lymph node biopsy revealed noncaseating granulomas and were able to resume their immunotherapy without any further interventions or negative effect on their disease course. These  cases illustrate the importance of obtaining a tissue diagnosis when imaging reveals enlarging lymph nodes while on immunotherapy for solid malignancies as the differential diagnosis includes benign entities such as sarcoid-like reactions in addition to disease progression. Timely diagnosis through minimally invasive tissue sampling techniques, such as endobronchial ultrasound, can help rule out malignant etiologies of lymphadenopathy and minimize interruptions in treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515801>An agonistic anti-Toll-like receptor 4 monoclonal antibody as an effective adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>- blockade antibodies have been approved for the treatment of cancer. However, poorly immunogenic tumours are less responsive to such therapies. Agonistic anti-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) activate only -surface TLR4; in contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates both TLR4 and intracellular inflammatory caspases. In this study, we investigated the adjuvant activity of an anti-TLR4 mAb in T--mediated antitumour immunity. The anti-TLR4 mAb induced the activation of antigen-specific T-cells in adoptive transfer studies. The growth of ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing tumours was significantly suppressed by administration of OVA and the anti-TLR4 mAb in combination, but not individually. The antitumour effect of anti-PD-1 mAb was enhanced in mice administered with OVA plus the anti-TLR4 mAb. The OVA-specific IFN-γ-producing CD8 T-cells were induced by administration of OVA and the anti-TLR4 mAb. The suppression of tumour growth was diminished by depletion of CD8, but not CD4, T-cells. The inflammatory response to the anti-TLR4 mAb was of significantly lesser magnitude than that to LPS, as assessed by NF-κB activation and production of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. Administration of LPS (at a dose that elicited levels of proinflammatory cytokines comparable to those by the anti-TLR4 mAb) plus OVA induced no or less-marked activation of OVA-specific T-cells and failed to suppress tumour growth in mice. In conclusion, the agonistic anti-TLR4 mAb induces potent CD8 T--dependent antitumour immunity and an inflammatory response of lesser magnitude than does LPS. The agonistic anti-TLR4 mAb has potential as an adjuvant for use in vaccines against cancer.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526549>-Mediated Therapies in Lymphoma.</a></h2><p>To review types of lymphoma, risk factors, and evaluate novel -mediated therapies, including side effects and management of -mediated toxicities.Published literature, national statistics, and Web sites.Novel biologic agents are being developed with the potential to improve outcomes.

Systemic treatments for metastatic renal  carcinoma have improved recently. Vascular endothelial growth factor targeting therapies were the previous standard of care. However,   inhibitors used in second line therapy have now been shown to improve patient survival. We report a case of metastatic renal  carcinoma with nivolumab as a second-line therapy after progression with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Unusual adverse events in metastatic renal  carcinoma, such as vitiligo, were observed in this patient who developed a remarkable documented pathological complete response to his renal tumor.  A 60-year-old caucasian male was diagnosed with a pulmonary metastatic clear  renal  carcinoma. Sunitinib was used as first line treatment without success. He received nivolumab in second-line treatment. He developed several -related adverse events, most notably vitiligo. The patient had a radiological complete response on metastatic sites, with a significant decrease of renal tumor volume and underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy after  years of treatment, confirming the pathological complete response. The patient remains disease-free for 10 months without further systemic therapy after nivolumab discontinuation.  Pathological complete response with nivolumab in metastatic renal  carcinoma is rare. This case further highlights the potentially predictive role of -related adverse events during nivolumab therapy for metastatic renal  carcinoma and raises questions concerning the role of nephrectomy after   inhibitor therapy. Further studies are needed to better identify predictive factors for treatment response to immunotherapy in metastatic renal  carcinoma, and to better understand the role of nephrectomy after nivolumab treatment.Copyright © 2019 Billon, Walz, Brunelle, Thomassin, Salem, Guerin, Vicier, Dermeche, Albiges, Tantot, Nenan, Pignot and Gravis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550390>-related adverse reactions in the hepatobiliary system: Second generation  inhibitors highlight diverse histological changes.</a></h2><p>  inhibitors are known to cause -mediated adverse liver injury, but our knowledge is mainly based on cases treated with ipilimumab or nivolumab.Clinicopathological features of 10 patients with hepatobiliary adverse reactions caused by second generation drugs, pembrolizumab (n=6) and atezolizumab (n=4), were reviewed.Liver dysfunction developed in a median period of 3.5 weeks after administration of the  inhibitor (3 days to 1 year). Antinuclear antibodies were detected in two patients at a low titre (1/80), and serum IgG concentrations were also only mildly elevated in two patients. Liver biopsies showed panlobular hepatitis (n=5), cholangiopathic changes (n=), granulomatous injury (n=), and bland cholestasis (n=1). Two cases of cholangiopathy (both pembrolizumab-treated) showed diffuse sclerosing cholangitis on imaging, and one also presented lymphocytic cholangitis resembling primary biliary cholangitis on biopsy. In two atezolizumab-treated cases, Kupffer cells were hyperplastic and aggregated, forming microgranulomas. Confluent necrosis and eosinophilic or plasma- infiltration were rare. On immunostaining, the ratio of CD8+/CD4+ cells was 12. ± 5.1, which was significantly higher than that in autoimmune hepatitis (.7 ± 1.1; p<0.001) or idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (5.0 ± 1.1; p=0.014). All patients responded to steroid therapy, but it was less effective in patients with sclerosing cholangitis.Pembrolizumab and atezolizumab manifested not only lobular hepatitis but also sclerosing cholangitis, lymphocytic duct injury, and granulomatous hepatitis, probably representing various impaired cellular functions in CD8+ lymphocytes and macrophages due to blockage of PD-1-PD-L1 interaction.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475851>Precision medicine for metastatic colorectal cancer: an evolving era.</a></h2><p>: Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a dilemma for cancer researchers with an increasing incidence in the younger patient population. Until the last decade, limited therapeutic options were available for metastatic CRC patients leading to relatively poor clinical outcomes.: With advances in genome sequencing technology and reductions in the cost of next-generation sequencing, molecular profiling has become more accessible for cancer researchers and clinical investigators, which has furthered our understanding of the molecular behavior of CRC. This progress has recently translated into significant advances in molecular-based therapeutics and led to the development of new target-specific agents in metastatic CRC patients. In this review article, we extensively elaborate on genomic alterations seen in CRC patients including, but not limited to, EGFR, MMR, BRAF, HER2, NTRKs, FGFR, BRCA1/, PALB2, POLE, and POLD1 genes, all of which are potentially actionable by either an FDA-approved agent or in a clinical trial setting.: We strongly recommend molecular profiling in metastatic CRC patients during the early course of their disease, as this may provide therapeutic and prognostic information that can guide clinicians to practice precision medicine.

The implications of these first-line treatments are considerable, given the potential population of patients eligible to receive them and their high cost.To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding atezolizumab to bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel as a first-line treatment strategy for patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small  lung cancer in the United States.In this economic evaluation, a primary microsimulation model was developed to assess atezolizumab combination vs bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel alone in the first line (base case 1). A secondary model was developed to assess these treatments along with pembrolizumab combination and platinum doublet chemotherapy (base case ). Treatment strategies and other simulated conditions were based on those from the IMpower150 and KEYNOTE-189 clinical trials. The study perspective was the US health care sector. One million patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small  lung cancer were simulated for each treatment group. This study was performed from February 2019 through May 2019.Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were compared with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).In base case 1, in which 1 million patients were simulated, treating with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel in the first line was associated with a mean cost of $112 551 (95% CI, $112 450-$112 653) and a mean survival of 1.48 QALYs (95% CI, 1.47-1.48 QALYs) per patient. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel was associated with a mean cost of $244 166 (95% CI, $243 864-$244 468) and a mean survival of .13 QALYs (95% CI, .12-.13 QALYs) per patient, for an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $201 676 per QALY (95% CI, $198 105-$205 355 per QALY).

Pembrolizumab combination dominated atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $116 698 per QALY (95% CI, $115 088-$118 342 per QALY) between pembrolizumab combination and bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel. Atezolizumab combination was not cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY.In this simulated model economic analysis, atezolizumab combination was not cost-effective compared with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel and provided suboptimal incremental benefit compared with cost vs pembrolizumab combination for first-line treatment. Although atezolizumab combination therapy provides clinical benefits, price reductions may be necessary for this treatment strategy to become cost-effective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622621>Therapeutic Targeting of the Colorectal Tumor Stroma.</a></h2><p>Colorectal tumors have been classified based on histologic factors, genetic factors, and consensus molecular subtypes, which all affect the tumor microenvironment (TME).

Novel insights on molecular mechanisms and regimens to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy are warranted, as only a minority of patients (˜20%) respond to  blockade. Taking into account the multiple mechanisms adopted by tumor cells to evade the  system through cancer immunoediting, the frontline combination of   inhibitors with chemotherapy appears to be a successful strategy as: 1) it enhances the recognition and elimination of tumor cells by the host  system (immunogenic -death), and ) it reduces the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Remarkably, the   inhibitors pembrolizumab and atezolizumab have already been approved by the FDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC and many other chemo-immunotherapeutic regimens have been evaluated as an initial therapeutic approach in metastatic NSCLC. Concurrently, several preclinical studies are evaluating the molecular mechanisms underlying immunomodulation by conventional chemotherapeutic agents (platinum salts, antimitotic agents, antimetabolites and anthracyclines), unraveling drug- and dose/schedule-dependent effects on the  system that should be exploited to achieve synergistic clinical activity. The current review provides a detailed overview of the immunobiological rationale and molecular basis for combining   inhibitors with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.

We investigated whether infection with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) associates with development and severity of colitis in patients receiving   inhibitor therapies.We performed a retrospective analysis of fixed colon tissues from 16 patients (12 men, 4 women, median age, 69.5 y) with colitis after   inhibitor therapy (9 patients treated with anti-CTLA4, 3 patients treated with anti-PD1, and 4 patients received a combination). Ten tissue samples were biopsies and 6 were collected during resection (4 surgeries for colon perforation). Patients were treated between 2010 and 2018 in the United Kingdom. The tissues were analyzed by pathology, in situ hybridization (to detect EBV-encoded small RNAs [EBERs]), and immunohistochemistry. Clinical data were also collected.Colon tissues from 4 of the 13 patients who received anti-CTLA4 (alone or in combination, 4 with colon perforation) had EBV-positive lymphoproliferations that manifested as florid ulcers associated with polymorphous infiltrates containing EBV-positive blasts (CD30+ or CD30-negative, CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+), plasma cells (CD138+, CD20-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), and small B cells (CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), consistent with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers (EBVMCUs). In analyses of biopsies collected from  patients with EBVMCUs over multiple time points, we found that earlier biopsies had no or only a few EBV-positive cells, whereas 1 later biopsy had EBVMCU and co-infection with cytomegalovirus. EBVMCUs were associated with steroid-refractory colitis (100% of EBV-positive patients vs 12.5% of EBV-negative patients; P=.008) and colon perforation (100% of EBV-positive patients vs no EBV-negative patients; P=.001).We found that colon tissues from 4/13 patients with colitis after anti-CTLA4 therapy (4/6 patients who underwent resection and 4/4 patients with colon perforation) contained EBVMCUs. EBVMCUs seem to arise secondarily in areas of inflamed colon due to immunosuppressive treatment for colitis.

The transition from cytokine to targeted therapy, and now to novel immunotherapeutic agents, significantly increased the overall survival (OS) of patients with mccRCC. Currently, 7 targeted agents and the combination of nivolumab/ipilimumab (  inhibitors, ICIs) have been approved as first-line therapy for mccRCC. Based on evidence from randomized phase III clinical trials, sunitinib and pazopanib (Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF-TKIs) are the most effective first-line options, especially in favorable and indermediate risk patients. Nivolumab/ipilimumab (dual  inhibitors) seem to be the preferred first-line therapy in poor-risk patients, although cabozantinib, temsirolimus, sunitinib and pazopanib are also recommended. HD IL- remains a reasonable first-line treatment option in selected, favorable-risk younger patients with good performance status. Based on data of previous phase I and II studies, several phase III trials investigating the efficacy and safety of the combination of ICI/VEGF-TKI versus sunitinib in untreated mccRCC are currently underway. These emerging therapies include the combinations of pembrolizumab/lenvatinib, pembrolizumab/axitinib, avelumab/axitinib and atezolizumab/ bevacizu-mab and seem to introduce the mccRCC therapy in a new auspicious era. Moreover, emerging new targeted therapies and other, beyond ICIs, immunotherapies are currently underway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678303>Disruption of SIRT7 Increases the Efficacy of  Inhibitor via MEF2D Regulation of PD-L1 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.</a></h2><p>  inhibitors have some efficacy in treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Programmed  death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), expressed on some cancer cells, binds to the receptor programmed  death 1 (PDCD1, also called PD1) on T cells to prevent their proliferation and reduce the antigen-tumor  response.  cells that infiltrate some types of HCCs secrete interferon gamma (IFNG). Some HCC cells express myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), which has been associated with shorter survival times of patients. We studied whether HCC  expression of MEF2D regulates expression of PD-L1 in response to IFNG.We analyzed  cells from 20 fresh HCC tissues by flow cytometry. We analyzed 225 fixed HCC tissues (from  cohorts) from patients in China by immunohistochemistry and obtained survival data. We created mice with liver-specific knockout of MEF2D (MEF2D mice). We knocked out or knocked down MEF2D, E1A binding protein p300 (p300), or sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) in SMMC-7721, Huh7, H22, and Hepa1-6 HCC  lines, some incubated with IFNG. We analyzed liver tissues form mice and  lines by RNA sequence, immunoblot, dual luciferase reporter, and chromatin precipitation assays. MEF2D protein acetylation and proteins that interact with MEF2D were identified by co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays. H22 cells, with MEF2D knockout or without (controls) were transplanted into BALB/c mice, some mice were given antibodies to deplete T cells. Mice bearing orthotopic tumors grown from HCC cells with or without knockout of SIRT7, were given injections of an antibody against PD1. Growth of tumors was measured and tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.In human HCC specimens, we found an inverse correlation between level of MEF2D and numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells; level of MEF2D correlated with percentages of PD1-positive or TIM3-positive CD8 T cells. Knockout of MEF2D from H22 cells reduced their growth as allograft tumors in -competent mice, but not in -deficient mice or mice with depletion of CD8 T cells. When MEF2D-knockout cells were injected into -competent mice, they formed smaller tumors that had increased infiltration and activation of T cells, compared with control HCC cells. In human and mouse HCC cells, MEF2D knockdown or knockout reduced expression of PD-L1. MEF2D bound the promoter region of the CD274 gene (encodes PD-L1) and activated its transcription. Overexpression of p300 in HCC cells, or knockout of SIRT7, promoted acetylation of MEF2D and increased its binding, along with acetylated histones, to the promoter region of the CD274. Exposure of HCC cells to IFNG induced expression of p300 and its binding MEF2D, which reduced the interaction between MEF2D and SIRT7. MEF2D-induced expression of PD-L1 upon IFNG exposure was independent of interferon-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) or IRF9. In HCC cells not exposed to IFNG, SIRT7 formed a complex with MEF2D that attenuated expression of PD-L1. Knockout of SIRT7 reduced proliferation of HCC cells and growth of tumors in -deficient mice. Compared with allograft tumors grown from control HCC cells, in -competent mice, tumors grown from SIRT7-knockout HCC cells expressed higher level of PD-L1 and had reduced infiltration and activation of T cells. In -competent mice given antibodies to PD1, allograft tumors grew more slowly from SIRT7-knockout HCC cells than from control HCC cells.Expression MEF2D by HCC cells increases their expression of PD-L1, which prevents CD8 T -mediated anti-tumor immunity. When HCC cells are exposed to IFNG, p300 acetylates MEF2D, causing it to bind the CD274 gene promoter and upregulate PD-L1 expression. In addition to promoting HCC  proliferation, SIRT7 reduced acetylation of MEF2D and expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells not exposed to IFNG.

However, a major challenge in the process of ICB treatment is when tumors do not have enough infiltrating T cells. Antiangiogenic drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors have been approved for the treatment of various malignant solid tumors alone or in combination with other therapies. Our review mainly discusses the preclinical rationale and clinical efficacy of antiangiogenic and ICB combination therapy in urogenital tumors.We reviewed relevant literature on preclinical research and clinical trial results regarding antiangiogenic and ICB combination therapy in urogenital tumors from PubMed. In addition, we searched ongoing clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov to collect information related to this specific topic.Antiangiogenesis therapy could enhance T  recruitment and increase T  infiltration into the tumor microenvironment by blocking VEGF-VEGF receptor  binding and downstream signaling pathways to normalize tumor blood vessels. The combination of ICB and antiangiogenesis therapy could improve antitumor activity according to subsequent preclinical experiments and several phase I/II/III clinical trials on urogenital tumors.Combined therapy has shown some antitumor efficacy in several urogenital tumors, such as metastatic renal  carcinoma, metastatic urothelial and genitourinary tumors, endometrial carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and fallopian tube cancer. Combination therapy is a promising strategy that can be used to improve the therapeutic efficacy, and the identification of precise biomarkers of this combined therapy is the direction of future studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576433>  inhibition in sepsis: a Phase 1b randomized study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of nivolumab.</a></h2><p>Sepsis-associated immunosuppression increases hospital-acquired infection and viral reactivation risk. A key underlying mechanism is programmed  death protein-1 (PD-1)-mediated T- function impairment. This is one of the first clinical safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) assessments of the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab and its effect on  biomarkers in sepsis.Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, Phase 1b study in 31 adults at 10 US hospital ICUs with sepsis diagnosed ≥ 24 h before study treatment, ≥ 1 organ dysfunction, and absolute lymphocyte count ≤ 1.1 × 10 cells/μL. Participants received one nivolumab dose [480 mg (n = 15) or 960 mg (n = 16)]; follow-up was 90 days. Primary endpoints were safety and PK parameters.Twelve deaths occurred [n = 6 per study arm; 40% (480 mg) and 37.5% (960 mg)]. Serious AEs occurred in eight participants [n = 1, 6.7% (480 mg); n = 7, 43.8% (960 mg)]. AEs considered by the investigator to be possibly drug-related and -mediated occurred in five participants [n = , 13.3% (480 mg); n = 3, 18.8% (960 mg)]. Mean ± SD terminal half-life was 14.7 ± 5.3 (480 mg) and 15.8 ± 7.9 (960 mg) days. All participants maintained > 90% receptor occupancy (RO) 28 days post-infusion.

A sample size of 52 patients provided 80% power to distinguish substantial agreement (κ = 0.85) from poor agreement (κ = 0.5) based on the Cohen κ.Interrater agreement of  observers in the occurrence and grade of irAE.Of 52 patients (32 [61.5%] male; mean [SD] age, 69 [9] years) analyzed, 42 (80.8%) had non-small  lung cancer and all received anti-programmed  death 1 or anti-programmed  death ligand 1 antibodies, with 3 patients (5.8%) receiving combinations with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibodies. A median (interquartile range) of 82 (47-180) documents were reviewed per case. There was limited or poor interrater agreement on irAE occurrence (Cohen κ, 0.37-0.64), with the exception of hypothyroidism (κ = 0.8). Weighted κ similarly showed limited or poor agreement for irAE grade (κ = 0.31-0.75). Differences in assessed time of onset ranged from 5 to 188 days. As a control for data availability and access, observers had a high degree of agreement for the exact start date (98%) and end date (96%) of immunotherapy administration, suggesting that information interpretation rather than identification largely accounted for assessment differences. In multivariable analysis, therapy duration (adjusted odds ratio, 4.80; 95% CI, 1.34-17.17; P = .02) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (adjusted odds ratio, 4.09; 95% CI, 1.10-15.18; P = .03) were significantly associated with discordant irAE assessment.These findings underscore critical challenges in assessing the occurrence, type, timing, and severity of irAE. Apart from hypothyroidism (a condition that has a discrete diagnostic laboratory test and few other likely etiologies during immunotherapy treatment), interobserver agreement was poor. Given the importance of accurate and timely assessment of toxic effects for clinical trials and real-world disease management, efforts to improve irAE diagnosis and characterization are needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461358>THYROID DYSFUNCTION, RECOVERY, AND PROGNOSIS IN MELANOMA PATIENTS TREATED WITH   INHIBITORS: A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW.</a></h2><p> To describe thyroid dysfunction, factors associated with thyroid recovery, and survival in melanoma patients treated with   inhibitors that developed thyroid  related adverse events (irAEs).  This is a retrospective study in a tertiary center from 2010-2017. We reviewed the charts of patients with melanoma that developed thyroid dysfunction after  inhibitor therapy. Cases with thyroid irAEs were grouped by recovery of thyroid function at one year. We collected a timeline of thyroid function tests, medication exposure, and survival and compared variables between the groups. We studied survival in comparison to a matched group without thyroid dysfunction.  186 melanoma patients received  inhibitors and 17 (9%) had thyroid irAEs. Median time to abnormal TSH was 38 days and followed a pattern of thyroiditis. Seven of 17 had thyroid recovery. In the no recovery group, free T4 was often above  ng/dL (5/10 in no recovery, 0/7 in recovery: p=0.040). In the recovery group, irAE grade was significantly lower with 7/7 grade 1 (p=0.004). Exposure to glucocorticoids was associated with recovery (3/10 in no recovery, 6/7 in recovery: p= 0.049). There was no difference in overall survival between the thyroid dysfunction group and controls, or between those that received glucocorticoids or not.  Certain aspects of thyroid irAEs may correlate with thyroid recovery, including grade 1 thyroid irAEs, exposure to glucocorticoids, and peak free T4 levels less than  ng/dL. Thyroid irAEs did not appear to be associated with change in survival nor did exposure to glucocorticoids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581482>Correlation between B7-H4 and Survival of Non-Small- Lung Cancer Patients Treated with Nivolumab.</a></h2><p>Reliable predictors of benefit from   inhibitors in non-small- lung cancer (NSCLC) are still limited. We aimed to evaluate the association between the expression of selected molecules involved in  response and clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients receiving nivolumab. In our study, the outcomes of 46 NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab in second or subsequent lines (Nivolumab Cohort) were compared with the expression of PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, B7-H3, and B7-H4 assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Samples from 17 patients (37.0%) in the Nivolumab Cohort were positive for B7-H4 expression. At univariate analyses, only B7-H4 expression was associated with significantly decreased progression-free survival (PFS; 1.7 vs. .0 months;  = 0.026) and with a disadvantage in terms of overall survival (OS) close to statistical significance (4.4 vs. 9.8 months;  = 0.064). At multivariate analyses, B7-H4 expression was significantly associated with decreased PFS (hazard ratio (HR) = .28;  = 0.021) and OS (HR = .38;  = 0.022). Subsequently, B7-H4 expression was compared with clinical outcomes of 27 NSCLC patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy (Chemotherapy Cohort), but no significant association was observed. Our results suggest a negative predictive role of B7-H4 in a population of NSCLC treated with   inhibitors, which deserves further research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570447>Expression of   Receptors on T-Cells and Their Ligands on Leukemia Blasts in Childhood Acute Leukemia.</a></h2><p>Possible correlations between the expression of   molecules and prognosis in childhood acute leukemia were investigated.The expression of programmed-death 1 (PD1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) was determined by flow cytometry on peripheral αβ and γδ T-cells from patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n=9) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=12), and from healthy volunteers (n=7). The expression of programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1), B7-1, B7-, human leukocyte antigen-ABC (HLA-ABC), and herpesvirus-entry mediator (HVEM) ligands was determined on leukemia blasts.PD1 expression on αβ and γδ T-cells was significantly higher in patients with ALL than in those with AML (p=0.0019 and 0.0239, respectively). CTLA-4 expression was moderately higher on αβ and γδ T-cells in ALL (p=0.077 and 0.077, respectively), whereas HLA-ABC expression was significantly higher in AML blast cells (p=0.0182). The expression of CTLA-4 on γδ T-cells and the B7- ligand on blasts was higher in patients with high-risk ALL (p=0.02 and 0.02, respectively). In AML, PD1 expression on αβ T-cells was higher in the intermediate-risk group (p=0.05), whereas HVEM expression was significantly higher in the low-risk group (p=0.02). Expression of CTLA-4 on γδ+ T-cells and PD-L1 on blasts were both associated with poor relapse-free survival outcomes in ALL (p=0.049).The higher expression of   molecules, in particular, CTLA-4 and PD-L1 are associated with a poorer prognosis in ALL, suggesting that selective use of the   blockade might improve the clinical outcomes in patients with ALL.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Given the low prevalence of MSI-high status in GC and its association with other positive prognostic variables, large data sets are needed to draw robust evidence of its prognostic/predictive value.We performed a multinational, individual-patient-data meta-analysis of the prognostic/predictive role of MSI in patients with resectable GC enrolled in the MAGIC, CLASSIC, ARTIST, and ITACA-S trials. Prognostic analyses used multivariable Cox models (MVM). The predictive role of MSI was assessed both in an all-comer population and in MAGIC and CLASSIC trials by MVM testing of the interaction of treatment (chemotherapy plus surgery  surgery) with MSI.MSI status was available for 1,556 patients: 121 (7.8%) had MSI-high status; 576 were European, and 980 were Asian. In MSI-high versus MSI-low/microsatellite stable (MSS) comparisons, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 71.8% (95% CI, 63.8% to 80.7%) versus 52.3% (95% CI, 49.7% to 55.1%); the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 77.5% (95% CI, 70.0% to 85.8%) versus 59.3% (95% CI, 56.6% to 62.1%). In MVM, MSI was associated with longer DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.88; 95% CI, 1.28 to .76;  < .001) and OS (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.17 to .73;  = .008), as were pT, pN, ethnicity, and treatment. Patients with MSI-low/MSS GC benefitted from chemotherapy plus surgery: the 5-year DFS compared with surgery only was 57% versus 41% (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79), and the 5-year OS was 62% versus 53% (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.94). Conversely, those with MSI-high GC did not: the 5-year DFS was 70% versus 77% (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.53 to 3.04), and the 5-year OS was 75% versus 83% (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.55 to 4.12).In patients with resectable primary GC, MSI is a robust prognostic marker that should be adopted as a stratification factor by clinical trials.

To date, novel emerging immunotherapies have significantly improved outcomes for patients with various cancer types. Human endogenous retrovirus‑H long terminal repeat‑associating protein  (HHLA2), a newly discovered   molecule, has demonstrated its potential as a novel therapeutic target. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the clinical prognostic value of HHLA2 in gliomas and its mechanistic role. A systematic review of datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas was performed. The RNA‑seq data of a total of 669 cases were analyzed and the biological function of HHLA2 was predicted by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis. Immunohistochemistry labelling images for HHLA2 was obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. xCell was used to comprehensively analyze the model of tumor‑infiltrating   in glioma. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to predict outcomes for glioma patients. The results revealed that the expression levels of HHLA2 were significantly lower in high‑grade glioma, as well as glioma with wild‑type isocitrate dehydrogenase, no deletion of 1p/19q and telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter mutation. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that HHLA2 was a predictor of the neural subtype. The tumor‑infiltrating   model indicated that HHLA2 was negatively associated with tumor‑associated macrophages. GO analysis and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that HHLA2‑associated genes were functionally involved in inhibition of neoplasia‑associated processes. HHLA2 was significantly negatively correlated with certain genes, including interleukin‑10, transforming growth factor‑β, vascular endothelial growth factor and δ‑like canonical Notch ligand 4, and other   molecules, including programmed  death 1, lymphocyte activating 3 and CD276. Survival analysis indicated that high expression of HHLA2 predicted a favorable prognosis. In conclusion, the present study revealed that upregulation of HHLA2 is significantly associated with a favorable outcome for patients with glioma. Targeting HHLA2 as an  stimulator may become a valuable approach for the treatment of glioma in clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654203>Therapy Line and Associated Predictors of Response to PD-1/PD-L1-Inhibitor Monotherapy in Advanced Non-small- Lung Cancer: A Retrospective Bi-centric Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>Evidence on PD-1/PD-L1-directed   inhibitor (ICI) therapy for advanced non-small- lung cancer (NSCLC) is mainly based on clinical trials in first- or second-line settings.We aimed to investigate response and prognostic factors with special regard to third- or later-line therapy.We retrospectively analyzed all patients who had received ICI monotherapy with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab for advanced NSCLC. Computed tomography evaluations were analyzed using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST, version 1.1). Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted to calculate progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival; the impact of influencing variables was evaluated using uni- and multivariate Cox-regression analyses.Among 153 patients (59% men, mean age 66 years), median PFS was 4 months [mo; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 3-5], OS was 13 mo (10-17), and objective response rate (ORR) was 22%. Therapy line ≥ 3 was associated with significantly inferior PFS (p = 0.003) and OS (p = 0.001). In first-line therapy PFS, OS, and ORR were 7 mo (3-11), 17 mo [9-not evaluable (n.e.)], and 36%; in second-line 4 mo (3-7), 18 mo (13-n.e.) and 19%, and in ≥ third-line  mo (1-3), 9 mo (4-12), and 13%. PFS was significantly influenced by PD-L1 expression in first-line therapy (p = 0.006). In ≥ third-line patients, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status significantly affected PFS and OS (both p < 0.001).Third- or later-line single-agent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is less efficacious as compared to first- and second-line treatment.

Not unexpectedly, the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo for their development of cancer therapy by the blockade of co-inhibitory signals. Unfortunately, manipulation of the co-inhibitory receptors has also resulted in a safety issue: widespread iatrogenic -related adverse events (irAEs). Autoimmunity is emerging as the nemesis of immunotherapy. Originally, it was assumed that CTLA-4 blockade selectively targets T cells relevant to the antitumour  response. However, an uncontrolled pan T  activation was induced compromising tolerance to healthy self-tissues. The irAEs are very similar to that of a chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) reaction following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We hypothesized that ipilimumab induced a graft-versus-malignancy (GVM) effect, which eradicated metastatic melanoma in a minority of patients, but also involved an auto-GVHD reaction that resulted in widespread autoimmunity in the majority. Therefore, we argued for a profound theoretical point against the consensus of experts. The task is not to desperately put the genie back in the bottle by -suppressive treatments, but instead to harness the autoimmune forces. In this way, the same goal could be achieved by an antibody as by the adoptive transfer of alloreactive donor lymphocytes, but without severe GVHD.

As randomized clinical trials with   inhibitors (ICI) have not been performed in patients with metastatic UM, we analyzed the real-world outcomes in a nationwide population-based study. Clinical data of patients with UM were extracted from the Danish Metastatic Melanoma database, a nationwide database containing unselected records of patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in Denmark. Survival before (pre-ICI,  = 32) and after (post-ICI,  = 94) the approval of first-line treatment with ICI was analyzed. A partial response to first-line treatment was observed in 7% of patients treated with anti-programmed  death protein (PD)-1 monotherapy and in 21% with combined anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 plus anti-PD-1 therapy. Median progression-free survival was .5 months for patients treated in the pre-ICI era compared to 3.5 months in the post-ICI era (hazard ratio (HR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.67;  < 0.001). The estimated one-year overall survival rate increased from 25.0% to 41.9% and the median overall survival improved from 7.8 months to 10.0 months, respectively (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.34-0.79;  = 0.003). Thus, the introduction of ICI as first-line treatment appears to have significantly improved the real-world survival of patients with metastatic UM, despite relatively low response rates compared to cutaneous melanoma.

However, previous studies have suggested conflicting results on the conditions of occurrence of ICI-induced vitiligo.The aim of this study was to describe the occurrences and outcomes of several cases of ICI-induced vitiligo.A retrospective study was carried out using the French Pharmacovigilance Database (FPD) between the beginning of the commercialization of ICI in France and 1 January 2019, selecting for analysis the vitiligo reactions of patients due to treatment with ICI.Among the 95 case patients identified in the FPD, the median times to onset of vitiligo after the start of pembrolizumab, nivolumab and ipilimumab therapies were 5.4, 5.0, and 3.8 months, respectively. Furthermore, 37 patients (45%) discontinued ICI treatment due to disease progression. The median follow-up time of all patients was 33 months (interquartile range -56).This study provided an overall picture of ICI-induced vitiligo in daily medical practice on a large number of pharmacovigilance observations of case patients. Among the observations of ICI-induced vitiligo, the diagnosed cancer was melanoma for almost all patients. Most patients in the study experienced other associated adverse drug reactions (ADRs), such as colitis, pruritus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, pancreatitis, and gastritis. Furthermore, our data suggest that the resolution of pembrolizumab- or nivolumab-induced vitiligo could be a marker of disease progression. Future studies evaluating vitiligo outcomes are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664934>Severe colitis after PD-1 blockade with nivolumab in advanced melanoma patients: potential role of Th1-dominant  response in -related adverse events: two case reports.</a></h2><p>Nivolumab is an   inhibitor specific to the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor. Nivolumab has shown clinical responses in many malignancies. Although -related adverse events (irAEs) associated with nivolumab are largely tolerable, severe irAEs have occurred in some patients. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of irAEs are not fully clarified.We report  patients with metastatic melanoma who developed colitis, an irAEs caused by nivolumab. Both patients experienced colitis after nivolumab administration. Pathological examination of the colon showed robust infiltration of CD8 cells and T-bet expressing CD4 cells in both cases, indicating helper T cells (Th) 1 to be responsible for the dominant response. Additionally, we observed the serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) reflected the clinical course of irAEs clearly in the two cases.Our two cases suggested that the development of irAEs due to nivolumab is associated with Th1 dominant response. CRP as well as IL-6 was found to be a potential biomarker for irAEs. Our findings may help to understand the mechanisms underlying irAEs caused by nivolumab and manage irAEs in clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609501>Cancer immunotherapy in patients with preexisting autoimmune diseases.</a></h2><p>We read with great interest the letter of Xie et al commenting on our article "Safety and Efficacy of   Inhibitors in Patients with Cancer and Preexisting Autoimmune Disease: A Nationwide Multicenter Cohort Study"(1).

Dysfunction of miRNAs is a major cause of aberrant expression of IRs and contributes to the  escape of cancer cells. How miRNAs regulate   proteins in breast cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, downregulation of miRNAs was observed in PD-1-overexpressing CD8 T cells using miRNA array analysis of mouse breast cancer homografts. The data reveal that miR-149-3p was predicted to bind the 3'UTRs of mRNAs encoding T- inhibitor receptors PD-1, TIM-3, BTLA and Foxp1. Treatment of CD8 T cells with an miR-149-3p mimic reduced apoptosis, attenuated changes in mRNA markers of T- exhaustion and downregulated mRNAs encoding PD-1, TIM-3, BTLA and Foxp1. On the other hand, T- proliferation and secretion of effector cytokines indicative of increased T- activation (IL-, TNF-α, IFN-γ) were upregulated after miR-149-3p mimic treatment. Moreover, the treatment with a miR-149-3p mimic promoted the capacity of CD8 T cells to kill targeted 4T1 mouse breast tumour cells. Collectively, these data show that miR-149-3p can reverse CD8 T- exhaustion and reveal it to be a potential antitumour immunotherapeutic agent in breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616186>Prospect of immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic agents in patients with advanced non-small  lung cancer.</a></h2><p>In the latest years, some drugs have been approved by European Medicines Agency (EMA) and/or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly for the treatment of those who have no targeted gene mutations or who have progressed on previously targeted therapy or platinum-containing dual-agent chemotherapy. In general, these drugs fall into two categories: anti-angiogenic agents and   inhibitors (ICIs). Anti-angiogenic agents currently approved by the FDA and/or EMA for advanced NSCLC treatment include bevacizumab, nintedanib, and ramucirumab. Anlotinib has been approved in advanced NSCLC by Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). These anti-angiogenic agents can induce anti-angiogenesis by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF2 or inhibiting multiple small molecules involved in angiogenic and proliferative pathways such as platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). Although these drugs show significant therapeutic efficacy, most patients inevitably experience disease progression resulting in death. ICIs approved by the FDA and/or EMA for advanced NSCLC treatment include nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab. These ICIs can significantly improve efficacy compared with standard chemotherapy by targeting programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor or PD- receptor with longer response duration and acceptable toxicity. However, the response rate of ICIs is suboptimal, and only a few patients ultimately benefit from immunotherapy. So current efforts have focused on exploring new potential combinatorial strategies with synergistic antitumor activity. Here, we summarized the theoretical basis, current clinical data, and potential future perspective of immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic agents for advanced NSCLC.© 2019 Liang and Wang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562536>PTPN3 expressed in activated T lymphocytes is a candidate for a non-antibody-type   inhibitor.</a></h2><p>It has been shown that protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type (PTPN) 3 inhibits T- activation. However, there is no definitive conclusion about how the inhibition of PTPN3 in lymphocytes affects  functions in human lymphocytes. In the present study, we showed that PTPN3 inhibition significantly contributes to the enhanced activation of activated human lymphocytes. The PTPN3 expression of lymphocytes was significantly increased through the activation process using IL- and anti-CD3 mAb. Interestingly, inhibiting the PTPN3 expression in activated lymphocytes significantly augmented the proliferation, migration, and cytotoxicity through the phosphorylation of zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70), lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). Lymphocyte activation by PTPN3 inhibition was observed only in activated CD3 T cells and not in NK cells or resting T cells. In therapy experiments using autologous tumors and lymphocytes, PTPN3 inhibition significantly augmented the number of tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes and the cytotoxicity of activated lymphocytes.

Between 2014 and 2018, Food and Drug Administration approvals of new drugs and agents have increased, with greater than  dozen novel agents. Rapidly identifying the risk profiles of these cancer therapeutics that may present with acute toxicities and understanding the timing, sequence, duration, and treatment of disease processes are the most important challenges faced by practitioners in emergency medicine, even in nononcologic centers. The emergency medicine literature lags behind rapid advances in oncology, and guidelines for rapid recognition and management of these emerging entities are not familiar. In this Review Article, we discuss the most recent and clinically relevant developments in the arena of hematologic malignancies, further expanding on drug toxicities and their clinical presentations and offering suggestions for management. Specifically, we discuss -related adverse events after   inhibitor therapy (including myocarditis and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), chimeric antigen receptor-T  therapy, cytokine release syndrome, chimeric antigen receptor-T -related encephalopathy syndrome, differentiation syndrome, sinusoid occlusion syndrome, QT-interval prolongation, and tumor lysis syndrome. Rapid advances in hematology and oncology will bring many new challenges for emergency health care providers in the near future; thus, the urgency to raise awareness among this community.Copyright © 2019 American College of Emergency Physicians.

We describe treatment patterns for malignant melanoma in the United States from the MarketScan database from 2011 to 2016.  Treatments used for patients aged >18 years diagnosed with malignant melanoma after January 1, 2011 and enrolled in the Truven MarketScan database were analyzed. Patient data were collected for the 12-month period from the date of the first melanoma diagnosis to either death, the pre-specified study end date (August 31, 2016), or date of termination of health insurance. Treatment patterns from 2011-2013 and 2014-2016 were analyzed according to agent, year of drug administration, and line of therapy.  From 2011 to 2016, use of cytokines (63.8; 13.3%) and chemotherapy (19.6; 12.9%) decreased, and use of  inhibitors increased (.0; 49.9%).  inhibitor use also increased across all lines of therapy from 2011-2013 and 2014-2016. Use of BRAF/MEK inhibitors remained relatively stable from 2011 to 2016 (6.5-12.5%); however, the use of vemurafenib monotherapy decreased (6.5; 0.8%), and treatment with combination regimens increased (0; 10.9%) from 2011-2016. BRAF/MEK inhibitor use only increased in the first line setting from 2011-2013 (9.7%) to 2014-2016 (11.%).  With the approval of   inhibitors, BRAF/MEK inhibitors, and targeted therapies, the therapeutic landscape for the treatment of metastatic melanoma has shifted dramatically away from cytokines and chemotherapy.

Our objective was to evaluate the utility of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in metastatic renal  carcinoma (mRCC) patients treated with nivolumab as well as the prognostic impact of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level.Sixty-five mRCC patients treated with nivolumab were enrolled. We retrospectively investigated several factors, including the NLR and the CRP level, for their association with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In addition, we evaluated their impact on the objective response.The CRP level was confirmed to be positively correlated with the NLR in a correlation analysis. An NLR ≥ 5 was significantly associated with a worse PFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.93-10.7; p < 0.001), and an NLR ≥ 5 and a CRP ≥ .1 mg/dL were identified as a significant factors predicting worse OS with HRs of 4.88 (95% CI 1.35-17.7; p < 0.016) and 3.89 (95% CI 1.01-15.0; p = 0.049), respectively. In addition, patients with a ≥ 25% decrease in the NLR and CRP level showed a significantly better response to nivolumab than those without a ≥ 25% decrease in the NLR and CRP level, with odds ratios of 9.54 (95% CI .09-49.8, p = 0.001) and 4.36 (95% CI 1.03-18.9, p = 0.032), respectively.Both the NLR and CRP levels were significantly associated with the clinical outcome of nivolumab in mRCC patients.

In this case study, we report a case of successful alternation of one PD-1 inhibitor for another after a hypersensitivity reaction.Nivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb) has been Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for a variety of malignancies, including a recent approval for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Infusion-related reactions occur in less than 1% of patients, and although such reactions are rare, recognition of infusion-related reactions induced by nivolumab is an important aspect of its usage. The PD-1  inhibitor pembrolizumab is also FDA approved for subsequent-line therapy in treatment of HCC. Thus far, approximately 0.% of patients experienced severe infusion-related reaction in studies using pembrolizumab. A 70-year-old male with HCC had an infusion reaction to nivolumab that presented as facial flushing, dyspnea, and back pain. The patient received prompt administration of diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone, which led to the amelioration of symptoms and allowed the patient to complete his immunotherapy treatment. For the third dose of nivolumab, the patient received premedications prior to treatment, including diphenhydramine, hydrocortisone, and famotidine. During his infusion, the patient experienced facial flushing, coughing, chest tightness, and an itchy throat. The patient again received diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone to treat infusion-related symptoms and his therapy was discontinued. Because of the nivolumab infusion-related reaction, nivolumab was discontinued, and the patient was started on pembrolizumab. The patient tolerated pembrolizumab without any subsequent infusion-related reactions. Prompt recognition and attention to immunotherapy infusion-related reactions could potentially prevent the fatal complication of anaphylaxis with   inhibitors. In this report, we describe the successful transition from one anti-PD-1 therapy to another for continued immunotherapy treatment without any subsequent infusion reactions.A patient with HCC was successfully treated with pembrolizumab after experiencing adverse effects with nivolumab.© American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2019.

However, the majority of cancer types, including high-risk neuroblastoma remain immunologically unresponsive. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive technique that can mechanically fractionate tumors, transforming immunologically 'cold' tumors into responsive 'hot' tumors.We treated <% of tumor volume in previously unresponsive, large, refractory murine neuroblastoma tumors with mechanical HIFU, and assessed systemic  response using flow-cytometry, ELISA, and gene sequencing. In addition, we combined this treatment with αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 to study its effect on the  response and long-term survival.Combining HIFU with αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 significantly enhances anti-tumor response, improving survival from 0 to 62.5%. HIFU alone causes upregulation of splenic and lymph node NK cells and circulating IL-, IFN-Ɣ, and DAMPs, whereas  regulators like CD4+Foxp3+, IL-10, and VEGF-A are significantly reduced. HIFU combined with  inhibitors induced significant increases in intratumoral CD4+, CD8ɑ+, and CD8α+CD11c+ cells, CD11c+ in regional lymph nodes, and decrease in circulating IL-10 compared to untreated group. We also report significant abscopal effect following unilateral treatment of mice with large, established bilateral tumors using HIFU and  inhibitors compared to tumors treated with HIFU or  inhibitors alone (61.1% survival, p<0.0001). This combination treatment significantly also induces CD4+CD44+CD62L+ and, CD8α+CD44+CD62L+ population and are adoptively transferable imparting immunity, slowing subsequent  tumor engraftment.Mechanical fractionation of tumors using HIFU can effectively induce  sensitization in a previously unresponsive murine neuroblastoma model, and promises a novel yet efficacious immuno-adjuvant modality to overcome therapeutic resistance.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666701>The clinical KRAS(G12C) inhibitor AMG 510 drives anti-tumour immunity.</a></h2><p>KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in cancer and encodes a key signalling protein in tumours.

Here we optimized a series of inhibitors, using novel binding interactions to markedly enhance their potency and selectivity. Our efforts have led to the discovery of AMG 510, which is, to our knowledge, the first KRAS(G12C) inhibitor in clinical development. In preclinical analyses, treatment with AMG 510 led to the regression of KRAS tumours and improved the anti-tumour efficacy of chemotherapy and targeted agents. In -competent mice, treatment with AMG 510 resulted in a pro-inflammatory tumour microenvironment and produced durable cures alone as well as in combination with - inhibitors. Cured mice rejected the growth of isogenic KRAS tumours, which suggests adaptive immunity against shared antigens. Furthermore, in clinical trials, AMG 510 demonstrated anti-tumour activity in the first dosing cohorts and represents a potentially transformative therapy for patients for whom effective treatments are lacking.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679184>  inhibitor-associated pituitary-adrenal dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>With the growing use of   inhibitors (ICIs), case reports of rare yet life-threatening pituitary-adrenal dysfunctions, particularly for hypopituitarism, are increasingly being published. In this analysis, we focus on these events by including the most recent publications and reports from early phase I/II and phase III clinical trials and comparing the incidence and risks across different ICI regimens. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception to April 2019 for clinical trials that reported on pituitary-adrenal dysfunction. The rates of events, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using random effects meta-analysis. The analyses included data from 160 trials involving 40 432 participants. The rate was .43% (95% CI, 1.73%-3.22%) for all-grade adrenal insufficiency and 3.25% (95% CI, .15%-4.51%) for hypophysitis. Compared with the placebo or other therapeutic regimens, ICI agents were associated with a higher incidence of serious-grade adrenal insufficiency (OR 3.19, 95% CI, 1.84 to 5.54) and hypophysitis (OR 4.77, 95% CI, .60 to 8.78). Among 71 serious-grade hypopituitarism instances in 12 336 patients, there was a significant association between ICIs and hypopituitarism (OR 3.62, 95% CI, 1.86 to 7.03). Substantial heterogeneity was noted across the studies for the rates of these events, which in part was attributable to the different types of ICIs and varied phases of the clinical trials. Although the rates of these events were low, the risk was increased following ICI-based treatment, particularly for CTLA-4 inhibitors, which were associated with a higher incidence of pituitary-adrenal dysfunction than PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.© 2019 The Authors.

However, in comparison with widely adopted mono-  inhibitors, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, the advantage of combination therapy of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 in response rate and prognosis is controversial especially considering probably increased treatment related adverse event. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and safety of combination treatment of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4.This meta-analysis involved 8 clinical trials. In most trials, the primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Thus we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare ORR of patients undergoing different treatment strategies. Moreover, the co-primary endpoints in few trials included progression-free survival and overall survival. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI were employed to weigh the influence of different treatments on prognosis of patients. Subgroup analysis was conducted in patients with high and low expression of PD-L1. Lastly, the safety of combination therapy was evaluated by comparing treatment related adverse events among various treatment groups.Our results showed that ORR was significantly higher in patients receiving α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 compared with α-PD-1 (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16-1.48) or α-CTLA-4 monotherapy (RR .11, 95% CI 1.84-.43), chemotherapy and targeted therapy (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.26-1.58). α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 treated patients had a great advantage on monotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy treated patients in PFS. Notably, no significant alteration in total adverse event rate was observed in α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 treated patients. Results of subgroup analysis showed that combination therapy could enhance anti-tumor response in comparison with other treatments, especially for low PD-L1 expression patients undergoing nivolumab treatment (ORR: RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11-1.65).Combination treatment of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 is a feasible strategy with enhanced efficacy and acceptable adverse event. Moreover, for some low PD-L1 expression patients, α-CTLA-4 might decrease the risk of resistance to α-PD-1 and demonstrate the synergistic anti-tumor effect.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608594>Safety and Efficacy of   Inhibitors in Patients with Cancer and Preexisting Autoimmune Disease: A Nationwide Multicenter Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>We read with great interest the article by Tison et al profiling safety and efficacy of   inhibitors (ICIs) in individuals with cancer and preexisting autoimmune disease (PAD) (1).

Immunostimulation may be beneficial for sepsis. We investigated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of nivolumab, a human programmed death-1   inhibitor approved for the treatment of several cancers.In this multicenter, open-label phase 1/ study, a single 480 or 960 mg nivolumab dose was intravenously infused into Japanese patients with immunosuppressive sepsis. Doses were selected to mimic the exposure achieved with the approved dosage for cancer patients (3 mg/kg every  weeks [Q2W]).Single 480 and 960 mg nivolumab doses were intravenously infused into five and eight patients, respectively. The maximum concentration after 480 mg (132 μg/mL) was similar to the predicted concentration at the end of infusion with 3 mg/kg Q2W (117 μg/mL). The concentration on Day 28 after 960 mg (33.1 μg/mL) was within the predicted trough concentration range for 3 mg/kg Q2W (90% prediction interval 19.0 to 163 μg/mL).

Therefore, a better stratification of patients and the development of novel therapeutic protocols are crucially needed. The importance of tumor-infiltrating B cells (TIL-Bs) in shaping antitumor immunity remains unclear; therefore, we analyzed frequency, phenotype, prognostic value and possible roles of TIL-Bs in OPSCC.We utilized transcriptomic analysis of  response-related genes in 18 OPSCC samples with respect to human papillomavirus (HPV) status. The density and localization of CD20, CD8 and DC-LAMP cells were subsequently analyzed in 72 tissue sections of primary OPSCC samples in relation to patients' prognosis. The immunohistochemical approach was supplemented by flow cytometry-based analysis of phenotype and functionality of TIL-Bs in freshly resected primary OPSCC tissues.We observed significantly higher expression of B -related genes and higher densities of CD20 B cells in HPV-associated OPSCC samples. Interestingly, CD20 TIL-Bs and CD8 T cells formed non-organized aggregates with interacting cells within the tumor tissue. The densities of both intraepithelial CD20 B cells and B /CD8 T  interactions showed prognostic significance, which surpassed HPV positivity and CD8 TIL density in stratification of OPSCC patients. High density of TIL-Bs was associated with an activated B  phenotype, high CXCL9 production and high levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Importantly, the abundance of direct B /CD8 T  interactions positively correlated with the frequency of HPV16-specific CD8 T cells, whereas the absence of B cells in tumor-derived  cultures markedly reduced CD8 T  survival.Our results indicate that high abundance of TIL-Bs and high density of direct B /CD8 T  interactions can predict patients with excellent prognosis, who would benefit from less invasive treatment. We propose that in extensively infiltrated tumors, TIL-Bs might recruit CD8 T cells via CXCL9 and due to a highly activated phenotype contribute by secondary costimulation to the maintenance of CD8 T cells in the tumor microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461377>Phase II Study of Avelumab in Patients With Mismatch Repair Deficient and Mismatch Repair Proficient Recurrent/Persistent Endometrial Cancer.</a></h2><p>Despite the tissue-agnostic approval of pembrolizumab in mismatch repair deficient (MMRD) solid tumors, important unanswered questions remain about the role of   blockade in mismatch repair-proficient (MMRP) and -deficient endometrial cancer (EC).This phase II study evaluated the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab in two cohorts of patients with EC: (1) MMRD/ (polymerase ε) cohort, as defined by immunohistochemical (IHC) loss of expression of one or more mismatch repair (MMR) proteins and/or documented mutation in the exonuclease domain of ; and () MMRP cohort with normal IHC expression of all MMR proteins. Coprimary end points were objective response (OR) and progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6). Avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenously was administered every  weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity.Thirty-three patients were enrolled. No patient with -mutated tumor was enrolled in the MMRD cohort, and all MMRP tumors were not -mutated. The MMRP cohort was closed at the first stage because of futility: Only one of 16 patients exhibited both OR and PFS6 responses. The MMRD cohort met the predefined primary end point of four ORs after accrual of only 17 patients; of 15 patients who initiated avelumab, four exhibited OR (one complete response, three partial responses; OR rate, 26.7%; 95% CI, 7.8% to 55.1%) and six (including all four ORs) PFS6 responses (PFS6, 40.0%; 95% CI, 16.3% to 66.7%), four of which are ongoing as of data cutoff date. Responses were observed in the absence of PD-L1 expression. IHC captured all cases of MMRD subsequently determined by polymerase chain reaction or genomically via targeted sequencing.Avelumab exhibited promising activity in MMRD EC regardless of PD-L1 status. IHC for MMR assessment is a useful tool for patient selection. The activity of avelumab in MMRP/non-mutated ECs was low.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444294>Programmed  Death Ligand 1 in Breast Cancer: Technical Aspects, Prognostic Implications, and Predictive Value.</a></h2><p>In the light of recent advances in the immunotherapy field for breast cancer (BC) treatment, especially in the triple-negative subtype, the identification of reliable biomarkers capable of improving patient selection is paramount, because only a portion of patients seem to derive benefit from this appealing treatment strategy. In this context, the role of programmed  death ligand 1 (PD-L1) as a potential prognostic and/or predictive biomarker has been intensively explored, with controversial results. The aim of the present review is to collect available evidence on the biological relevance and clinical utility of PD-L1 expression in BC, with particular emphasis on technical aspects, prognostic implications, and predictive value of this promising biomarker. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In the light of the promising results coming from trials of   inhibitors for breast cancer treatment, the potential predictive and/or prognostic role of programmed  death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in breast cancer has gained increasing interest. This review provides clinicians with an overview of the available clinical evidence regarding PD-L1 as a biomarker in breast cancer, focusing on both data with a possible direct impact on clinic and methodological pitfalls that need to be addressed in order to optimize PD-L1 implementation as a clinically useful tool for breast cancer management.© 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we investigated the association between TB and survival in NSCLC patients treated with ICIs in comparison with other biomarkers.We retrospectively evaluated 83 NSCLC patients with ICIs administered between February 2016 and December 2018. TB was measured as the sum of the unidimensional diameters of up to five target lesions.The median observation period was 14. months. A total of 42 patients died during the follow-up. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that baseline TB was associated with OS. Cox regression analysis adjusted for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) alone or with addition of programmed  death ligand 1 expression and treatment line showed that TB was a prognostic factor for OS. Using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the optimal TB cutoff for predicting OS was 12 cm, and patients were divided into a high TB group (n = 21) and a low TB group (n = 62). The low TB group achieved significantly longer OS than the high TB group (median OS: 18.5 months, [95% CI = 11.7-not reached] vs. .3 months [95% CI = 1.3-.9], P < 0.001).TB is a useful, clinically measurable prognostic factor of survival in NSCLC patients treated with ICIs.© 2019 The Authors.

Although there are several approved drugs for the treatment of gastric cancer, the survival of patients with advanced disease remains dismal. Ramucirumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- inhibitor, is an important new targeted drug approved for gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEJ) in second-line setting. : In this article, we have reviewed the role of ramucirumab in the management of gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma. A comprehensive review of various clinical trials is presented that support the use of ramucirumab in gastric cancer. : In our opinion, ramucirumab should be considered as a standard of care option, either alone or with paclitaxel, after progression on first-line therapy for advanced or metastatic disease. The results of large, randomized phase III clinical trials show benefit of ramucirumab on median overall survival (OS). However, the benefit is limited, with only about two months OS benefit of using ramucirumab with paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone. Novel combination therapies, such as ramucirumab with other targeted agents and   inhibitors in ongoing clinical trials, may provide important information to further improve the patient outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460379>Small-Molecule Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase and PD-L1 Inhibitor Conjugates as Dual-Action Anticancer Agents.</a></h2><p>  blockades have revolutionized the treatment landscape for several cancer indications, yet they have not gained traction in a range of other tumors such as triple-negative breast cancer. Despite durable disease control by many patients, a third of cancer patients relapse due to acquired resistance. Combined immunotherapy has shown significant promise to overcome these grand challenges. In this report, we describe the synthesis and characterization of dual-action small-molecule PARP1/PD-L1 inhibitor conjugates as potential targeted anticancer agents. These conjugates display significant apoptosis and cytotoxic efficacy to approximately -20-fold better than their individual agents in a panel of cancer  lines. This was underscored by derived combination indices, which was consistent with strong synergy when cells were treated with the individual agents, olaparib and BMS-001 using the Chou-Talalay method. Furthermore, we sought to unravel the mechanistic behavior of the conjugates and their implications on the PARP/PD-L1 axis. We used apoptosis,  , immunoblotting, and T- proliferation assays to establish the synergy imparted by these conjugates. These multifunctional compounds enable the discovery of small-molecule immunochemotherapeutic agents and chemical probes to elucidate the cross-talk between DNA repair and PD-L1 pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31549270>Combination therapy with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors for cancer.</a></h2><p>  inhibitors (ICIs)-such as antibodies to programmed  death-1 (PD-1), to its ligand PD-L1, or to cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4)-are an evolving treatment option for several types of cancer, but only a limited number of patients benefit from such therapy. Preclinical studies have suggested that the combination of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors with either cytotoxic chemotherapy or antibodies to CTLA-4 is a promising treatment strategy for advanced cancer. Indeed, combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been approved and are now used in clinical practice for the treatment of advanced non-small  lung cancer and small  lung cancer on the basis of positive results of large-scale clinical trials. In addition, the combination of antibodies to CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) and to PD-1 (nivolumab) has been found to confer a survival benefit in patients with melanoma or renal  carcinoma. Several ongoing clinical trials are also investigating ICI combination therapy in comparison with standard therapy for other tumor types. The identification of patients likely to achieve a sufficient benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy remains a challenge; however, with the establishment of novel complementary biomarkers being needed. Preclinical and clinical investigations of -related adverse events of ICI combination therapy are also warranted to establish management strategies.

Treatment strategies that can inhibit metastatic cancer while treating primary cancer are needed to improve the therapeutic effect of breast cancer.  In this study, a dual functional drug conjugate comprised of protoporphyrin IX and NLG919, a potent indoleamine-,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor, is designed to combine photodynamic therapy and   blockade to achieve both primary tumor and distant metastases inhibition. Liposomal delivery is applied to improve the biocompatibility and tumor accumulation of the drug conjugate (PpIX-NLG@Lipo). A series of  and  experiments were carried out to examine the PDT effect and IDO inhibition activity of PpIX-NLG@Lipo, and subsequently evaluate its anti-tumor capability in the bilateral 4T1 tumor-bearing mice.  The  and  experiments demonstrated that PpIX-NLG@Lipo possess strong ability of ROS generation to damage cancer cells directly through PDT. Meanwhile, PpIX-NLG@ Lipo can induce immunogenic  death to elicit the host  system. Furthermore, PpIX-NLG@Lipo interferes the activity of IDO, which can amplify PDT-induced  responses, leading to an increasing amount of CD8 T lymphocytes infiltrated into tumor site, finally achieve both primary and distant tumor inhibition.

Recently,  inhibitors have been approved for use in MMR-deficient cancers of any type (Prasad et al. in JAMA Oncol 4:157-158, 2018). Functional studies in breast cancer have shown associations between MMR loss, resistance to aromatase inhibitors and sensitivity to palbociclib (Haricharan et al. in Cancer Discov 7:1168-1183, 2017). Herein, we investigate the clinical meaning of MMR deficiency in breast cancer by immunohistochemical assessment of MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2 on a large series of breast cancers linked to detailed biomarker and long-term outcome data.Cases were classified as MMR intact when all four markers expressed nuclear reactivity, but MMR-deficient when at least one of the four biomarkers displayed loss of nuclear staining in the presence of positive internal stromal controls on the tissue microarray core.Among the 1635 cases with interpretable staining, we identified 31 (1.9%) as MMR-deficient. In our cohort, MMR deficiency was present across all major breast cancer subtypes, and was associated with high-grade, low-progesterone receptor expression and high tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte counts. MMR deficiency is significantly associated with inferior overall (HR .29, 95% CI 1.02-5.17, p = 0.040) and disease-specific survival (HR .71, 95% CI 1.00-7.35, p = 0.042) in the 431 estrogen receptor-positive patients who were uniformly treated with tamoxifen as their sole adjuvant systemic therapy.Overall, this study supports the concept that breast cancer patients with MMR deficiency as assessed by immunohistochemistry may be good candidates for alternative treatment approaches such as   or CDK4 inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593795>Targeted co-delivery of Trp- polypeptide and monophosphoryl lipid A by pH-sensitive poly (β-amino ester) nano-vaccines for melanoma.</a></h2><p>Dendritic  (DC)-targeted vaccines based on nanotechnology are a promising strategy to efficiently induce potent  responses.

To reduce immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, an   inhibitor, PD-L1 antagonist, was administrated along with PBAE nano-vaccines to delay melanoma development. We found that mannosylated Trp- and MPLA-loaded PBAE nano-vaccines can target and mature DCs, consequently boosting antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity against melanoma. The prophylactic study indicates that combination therapy with PD-L1 antagonist further enhanced anti-tumor efficacy by 3.7-fold and prolonged median survival time by 1.6-fold more than free Trp-/MPLA inoculation.

The aim of our study was to analyze DNA methylation of the encoding gene (IDO1) in HNSCC.Methylation of three CpG sites within the promoter, promoter flank, and gene body was investigated and correlated with mRNA expression,   infiltration, mutational burden, human papillomavirus (HPV)-status, and overall survival in a cohort of N = 528 HNSCC patients obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, IDO1 immunohistochemistry and DNA methylation analysis was performed in an independent cohort of N = 138 HNSCC samples.Significant inverse correlations of IDO1 methylation and IDO1 mRNA expression were found in the promoter and promoter flank region (Spearman's ρ = -0.163 and ρ = -0.377, respectively) while a positive correlation was present in the gene body (ρ = 0.502; all P < 0.001). IDO1 DNA methylation significantly correlated with IDO1 protein expressing  cells as well as tumor cells. IDO1 promoter flank hypermethylation was significantly associated with poor overall survival (P < 0.001). In addition, we discovered significant correlations between IDO1 methylation and expression with RNA signatures of   infiltrates and with HPV-status, mutational load (methylation only), and interferon γ signature.Our results suggest IDO1 expression levels are epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation.

We examined whether this ligand is a prognostic marker for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and whether it is associated with accumulation of  cells in the tumor. Serum s-CD95L levels in 51 patients with advanced ovarian cancer were tested by ELISA. IHC staining of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD163, CD31, FoxP3, CCR6, IL-17, Granzyme B, PD-L1, and membrane CD95L was used to assess tumor-infiltrating  cells. Although the intensity of CD3, CD8, CD4, CD20, and CD163 in tumor tissues remained constant regardless of membrane CD95L expression, tumors in patients with HGSOC with s-CD95L levels ≥516 pg/mL showed increased infiltration by CD3 T cells ( = 0.001), comprising both cytotoxic CD8 ( = 0.01) and CD4 ( = 0.0062) cells including FoxP3 regulatory T cells ( = 0.0044). Also, the number of tumor-infiltrating CD20 B cells ( = 0.0094) increased in these patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that low s-CD95L concentrations [<516 pg/mL, HR, 3.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-11.11), and <1,200 activated CD8 (Granzyme B) cells (HR, .63; 95% CI, 1.16-5.95) were independent poor prognostic factors for recurrence, whereas >6,000 CD3 cells (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15-0.79) was a good prognostic factor. Thus, low levels of s-CD95L (<516 pg/mL) are correlated with lower numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD3 and CD8, and also CD4 and FoxP3 T cells) in advanced HGSOC and are a poor prognostic marker. IMPLICATIONS: Serum s-CD95L is correlated with a number of tumor-infiltrating  cells in HGSOC and could be used as a noninvasive marker of tumor  infiltration to select patients referred for immunotherapy trials that evaluate  inhibitor treatment.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638948>Correlation between -related adverse events and prognosis in patients with gastric cancer treated with nivolumab.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have shown that -related adverse events (irAEs) caused by   inhibitors were associated with clinical benefit in patients with melanoma or lung cancer.

In this study, we retrospectively investigated the correlation between irAEs and efficacy in AGC patients treated with nivolumab.The subjects of this study were AGC patients received nivolumab monotherapy between January 2015 and August 2018. IrAEs were defined as those AEs having a potential immunological basis that required close follow-up, or immunosuppressive therapy and/or endocrine therapy. We divided the patients who received nivolumab into two groups based on occurrence of irAEs; those with irAEs (irAE group) or those without (non-irAE group). We assessed the efficacy in both groups.Of the 65 AGC patients that received nivolumab monotherapy, 14 developed irAEs. The median time to onset of irAEs was 30.5 days (range 3-407 days). Median follow-up period for survivors was 32 months (95% CI, 10.8 to 34.5).

RCC is a heterogeneous disease in terms of genetic and histological features which determine the behavior of the disease. The  () is a tumor suppressor gene and mutations of this gene are seen in 95% of clear- RCCs. Inactivation of  causes the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), and in turn, accumulation of HIF-1 induces overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); the increase in VEGF expression makes RCC a highly vascularized tumor, and forms the rationale for antiVEGF treatment. In the past decade, improvement in the survival of RCC patients has been observed due to new effective therapies, such as antiVEGF and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) targeting agents and   inhibitors. The majority of VEGF targeted agents are not just selective to VEGF receptors, but usually also have inhibitory effects on other kinases, such as c-KIT and FLT3.

Immunotherapeutical agents represent an emerging option for breast cancer treatment, including the human epidermal growth factor  positive (HER2+) subtype. The  system holds the ability to spontaneously implement a defensive response against HER2+ BC cells through complex mechanisms which can be exploited to modulate this response for obtaining a clinical benefit. Initial  system modulating strategies consisted mostly in vaccine therapies, which are still being investigated and improved. However, the entrance of trastuzumab into the scenery of HER2+ BC treatment was the real game changing event, which embodied a dominant -mediated mechanism. More recently, the advent of the   inhibitors has caused a new paradigm shift for immuno-oncology, with promising initial results also for HER2+ BC. Breast cancer has been traditionally considered poorly immunogenic, being characterized by relatively low tumor mutation burden (TMB). Nevertheless, recent evidence has revealed high tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed  death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in a considerable proportion of HER2+ BC patients. This may translate into a higher potential to elicit anti-cancer response and, therefore, wider possibilities for the use and implementation of immunotherapy in this subset of BC patients. We are herein presenting and critically discussing the most representative evidence concerning immunotherapy in HER2+ BC cancer, both singularly and in combination with therapeutic agents acting throughout HER2-block,   inhibition and anti-cancer vaccines.

T-cells are regulated by different  proteins at the immunological synapse including the B7 ligands (B7-1 or CD80 and B7- or CD86), which is discussed in this review. These ligands are typically expressed on antigen presenting cells and interact with CD28 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) receptors on T-cells. Their interactions with CD28 trigger a costimulatory signal that potentiates T- activation, function and survival in response to cognate antigen. In addition, their interactions with CTLA-4 can also inhibit certain effector T- responses, particularly in response to sustained antigen stimulation. Through these mechanisms, the balance between T- activation and suppression is maintained, preventing the occurrence of immunopathology. Given their crucial roles in  regulation, targeting B7 ligands has been an attractive strategy in cancer and autoimmunity. This review presents an overview of the essential roles of B7-1, highlighting the therapeutic benefits of modulating this protein in immunotherapy, and reviewing earlier and state-of-the-art efforts in developing anti-B7-1 inhibitors.

However, it has been shown that radiotherapy alone is unable to completely eradicate some tumors and could be associated with a high possibility of tumor recurrence. To date, various experimental and clinical studies have been conducted to explore some efficient targets within tumor microenvironment (TME) to enhance tumor response to radiotherapy; thus help eliminate or eradicate tumors. Although targeting DNA damage responses (DDRs) is associated with severe toxicities, studies in recent decade suggest that inhibition of some apoptosis/survival targets within TME is promising. This is also associated with changes in the numbers of T regulatory cells (Tregs) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The inhibition of cyclooxygenase- (COX-), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have also shown promising results. The combination of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors with radiotherapy is interesting as well as the clinical use of some drugs and antibodies. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are the most common RTK inhibitors. Some clinical trials in recent years have shown very interesting results for   inhibitors (ICIs), especially programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and CTLs-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors. It has been suggested that administration of ICIs during or after hypofractionated radiotherapy could lead to best results. In this review, we explain TME response to radiotherapy and potential targets for sensitization of cancer cells to radiotherapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

These agents can induce immuno-related adverse events (irAEs), which may affect the endocrine system.The aim of this study was to analyze the occurrence and the course of endocrine irAEs in cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.This was a retrospective, multicentre study, involving cancer patients treated with the PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab or pembrolizumab at reference Oncology Centres. One hundred and seventy-nine consecutive patients with different types of cancer (mostly non-small  lung cancer, melanoma, kidney cancer) were included in the study. Patients had received nivolumab (70.9%) or pembrolizumab (29.1%) for -33 months. The study evaluated clinical data records until the established date of July 15, 2018. The primary end point was the assessment of endocrine toxicity and possible predictive factors.Endocrine toxicity occurred in 54 out of 179 patients (30.%) and was related to thyroid dysfunction, with the exception of one case of diabetes mellitus. Thyroid toxicity occurred mostly within  months from the initiation of immunotherapy (83% of cases). A pre-existing thyroid dysfunction was a significant predictor of disease flare.Thyroid alterations are frequently associated with anti PD-1 treatment in cancer patients. Regular thyroid assessment should be performed, particularly in the first months of treatment and in patients with a pre-existing thyroid disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604532>Common gamma chain cytokines and CD8 T cells in cancer.</a></h2><p>Overcoming exhaustion-associated dysfunctions and generating antigen-specific CD8 T cells with the ability to persist in the host and mediate effective long-term anti-tumor immunity is the final aim of cancer immunotherapy. To achieve this goal, immuno-modulatory properties of the common gamma-chain (γ) family of cytokines, that includes IL-, IL-7, IL-15 and IL-21, have been used to fine-tune and/or complement current immunotherapeutic protocols. These agents potentiate CD8 T  expansion and functions particularly in the context of   (IC) blockade, shape their differentiation, improve their persistence in vivo and alternatively, influence distinct aspects of the T  exhaustion program. Despite these properties, the intrinsic impact of cytokines on CD8 T  exhaustion has remained largely unexplored impeding optimal therapeutic use of these agents. In this review, we will discuss current knowledge regarding the influence of relevant γ cytokines on CD8 T  differentiation and function based on clinical data and preclinical studies in murine models of cancer and chronic viral infection. We will restate the place of these agents in current immunotherapeutic regimens such as IC  blockade and adoptive  therapy. Finally, we will discuss how γ cytokine signaling pathways regulate T  immunity during cancer and whether targeting these pathways may sustain an effective and durable T  response in patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, in order to investigate the metabolic alterations in response to   blockade, we comprehensively profile serum metabolites in advanced melanoma and renal  carcinoma patients treated with nivolumab, an antibody against programmed  death protein 1 (PD1). We identify serum kynurenine/tryptophan ratio increases as an adaptive resistance mechanism associated with worse overall survival.

Overall survival in patients with non-small  lung cancer (.5 vs 26 months, P < .001), melanoma (3.9 vs 14 months, P < .001), and other tumor types (1.1 vs 11, P < .001) was consistently worse in those who received pATBs vs those who did not. Multivariate analyses confirmed that pATB therapy (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.9-6.1; P < .001) and response to ICI therapy (HR, 8.; 95% CI, 4.0-16.9; P < .001) were associated with OS independent of tumor site, disease burden, and performance status.Despite being limited by sample size, geographic origin, and the lack of correlative analyses on patients' gut microbiota, this study suggests that pATB therapy but not cATB therapy is associated with a worse treatment response and OS in unselected patients treated with ICIs in routine clinical practice. Mechanistic studies are urgently required to investigate ATB-mediated alterations of gut microbiota as a determinant of poorer outcome following ICI treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537155>Primary tumors of the lung: should we consider thermal ablation as a valid therapeutic option?</a></h2><p>Non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer death; percutaneous thermal ablation (TA) has proven feasibility, good local control and good tolerance in stage I tumors for patients with medical comorbidities and who are ineligible for surgery. In this context, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has demonstrated high efficacy in treating T1 NSCLC and will need to be compared with percutaneous ablation. TA is also indicated in oligoprogressive disease; and can be proposed as a salvage treatment option for tumor recurrence after radiotherapy. Besides more advanced NSCLC could be also an indication of TA in combination with systemic treatments. A large majority of diagnosed NSCLC do not exhibit specific targetable genetic aberration. Those tumors present poorer prognosis and have been treated with standard chemotherapy regimen until the recent development of   inhibitors (ICIs) based immunotherapy. Combining TA with immunotherapy is promising and still needs to be explored.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518968>Acute vascular events as a possibly related adverse event of immunotherapy: a single-institute retrospective study.</a></h2><p>-related toxicities of   inhibitors (CPIs) require prompt diagnosis and treatment. Atherosclerosis has an inflammatory component; we speculated this inflammation could be enhanced by CPIs. We aimed to evaluate the risk of acute vascular events (AVEs) on CPIs.Patients treated by CPIs in Sheba Medical Center (Israel) between January 2015 and May 2018 were retrospectively identified from electronic medical records. AVEs were identified and verified by chart review. Age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, previous AVE, renal failure, cancer type and specific treatments were evaluated as potential risk factors. AVE rate on CPIs was compared with that on chemotherapy or on combined chemo-immunotherapy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Survival of patients with AVEs was compared with that of patients without AVEs.CPI was administered to 1215 patients. AVEs within six months after CPI initiation occurred in .6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8-3.6) of patients, more common than in later time periods. In lung adenocarcinoma, event rate was 5.% (95% CI: .8-9.). Lung adenocarcinoma, prior AVE, hypertension and dyslipidemia were correlated with AVEs. AVE rate in patients with non-small  lung cancer adenocarcinoma was similar whether on chemotherapy or on CPI. Survival of patients with AVEs was worse than that of those without AVEs.The similarly increased rates of AVEs for patients on CPI, on chemotherapy or on both suggest that although CPI may not augment the risk of AVE over that of chemotherapy, it carries a similar and significant risk of such adverse event. Caution should be exercised for patients with risk factors for AVEs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The substantial risks and cost associated with this procedure render it unfeasible on a large scale. This strategy also indicates that a common pathway toward a cure for both HIV and cancer may exist. Successful approaches to curing both diseases should ideally possess three components, i.e., (1) direct targeting of pathological cells (neoplastic cells in cancer and the HIV-infected reservoir cells), () subsequent impediment to reconstitution of the pool of pathological cells and (3) sustained, immunologic control of the disease (both diseases are characterized by detrimental  hyper-activation that hinders successful establishment of immunity). In this review, we explore medications that are either investigational or FDA-approved anticancer treatments that may be employed to achieve the goal of curing HIV-1. These include: thioredoxin reductase inhibitors (phases 1-3),   inhibitors (phases 1, 3), Jak inhibitors (FDA approved for arthritis and multiple cancer indications, summarized in Table 1). Of note, some of these medications such as arsenic trioxide and Jak inhibitors may also reversibly down regulate CCR5 expression on CD4 T-cells, thus escaping the ethical issues of inducing or transferring mutations in CCR5 that are presently the subject of interest as it relates to HIV-1 cure strategies.Copyright © 2019 Gavegnano, Savarino, Owanikoko and Marconi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665718>Landscape of -Related Pneumonitis in Cancer Patients with Asthma Being Treated with   Blockade.</a></h2><p>Predicting the factors that increase the risk of -related pneumonitis, a potentially life-threatening complication of treatment with   inhibitors for cancer, is a clinical challenge. Baseline clinical factors such as asthma may portend the development of pneumonitis due to pre-existing airway inflammation prior to immunotherapy.The purpose of the study was to investigate whether a prior diagnosis of asthma is associated with an increased risk of -related pneumonitis in patients undergoing cancer immunotherapy.Patients at the Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health undergoing immunotherapy were identified on an IRB-approved protocol. Clinical charts were reviewed for asthma documented in the medical records and CT scans were reviewed during and after treatment. Pneumonitis was defined as the onset of new pulmonary symptoms with characteristic imaging findings during or after a patient's first course of immunotherapy that could not be readily explained as infection or a progression of malignancy. It was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.A total of 187 patients were included. A diagnosis of asthma was found in the records of 26 cases (13.9%). Pneumonitis was found in 10 cases (5.35%); 50% were grade  and 50% were grade 3-4. Two of the grade 3-4 cases (40%) occurred in patients with non-small- lung cancer. Three patients with asthma developed pneumonitis (11.5% of patients with asthma), all grade 3-4. Only 28.6% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis cases were grade 3-4. All (100%) of the asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers, while 71.4% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers.A history of asthma may be associated with a higher grade of pneumonitis if it develops, and a history of smoking may augment this relationship.© 2019 S.

In this process, mutated antigenic peptides referred to as neoantigens often serve as the target on cancer cells that are recognized by the T  receptor (TCR) on endogenous T cells. Another successful immunotherapy has involved adoptive T  therapy, where therapeutic doses of T cells expressing a gene for an anti-cancer receptor are delivered to a patient. This approach has been used primarily against hematopoietic cancers using synthetic receptors called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). CARs typically contain an antibody fragment (single-chain Fv, scFv) against a cancer  surface antigen such as the B  molecule CD19. While therapeutic CARs (and full antibodies) target antigens expressed on  surfaces, TCRs can target a much larger array of intracellular proteins by binding to any cellular peptide associated with an MHC product. These cancer targets include self-peptides from aberrantly expressed/overexpressed proteins or neoantigens. In this review, we discuss the use of TCRs in adoptive T  therapy and their target antigens. We focus on two properties that impact sensitivity, potency, and possible toxic cross-reactivity of TCR-mediated therapy: (1) the affinity of the TCR for the target antigen, and () the density of the target antigen. Finally, we provide a comprehensive listing of the current clinical trials that involve TCRs in adoptive T  cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513030>Programmed Death Ligand 1 Testing of Endobronchial Ultrasound-guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration Samples Acquired For the Diagnosis and Staging of Non-Small  Lung Cancer.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy has become an integral part of management in patients with advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in at least 50% of tumor cells on histologic samples has been correlated with improved efficacy of the   inhibitor pembrolizumab. A limited number of studies have examined the suitability of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) specimens for assessment of PD-L1 status.We sought to examine the feasibility and results of PD-L1 testing performed on EBUS-TBNA samples acquired for the diagnosis and staging of NSCLC.Patients were identified from a prospectively maintained pathology database. Baseline characteristics were tabulated. Hematoxylin and eosin slides were reviewed to categorize cellularity between <100, 100 to 500, and >500 viable tumor cells. Samples were tested using Dako's PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit, with a minimum of 100 viable tumor cells. For patients in whom additional tissue samples were available, the results of PD-L1 testing were compared.PD-L1 testing was attempted on 120 EBUS-TBNA samples. The most common NSCLC subtype was adenocarcinoma (78%). Seventy-six specimens (63%) had a cellularity >500 tumor cells. Among 110 of 120 (92%) patients with an adequate endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) sample, 53 of 110 (48.%) had high PD-L1 expression, defined as a Tumor Proportion Score ≥50%. EBUS PD-L1 results were concordant with an available histologic sample in 14 of 18 patients (78%), with no false-negative results.PD-L1 testing was feasible in the majority of EBUS-TBNA samples acquired for the diagnosis and staging of NSCLC.

Despite their wide applications in the clinical and preclinical stages, their concomitant viability and efficacy remain major issues. Herein, a strategy for harnessing regulatory T (Treg) cells is developed as an actively targeting drug-delivery system to transport drug-loaded liposomes to the desired tumor sites via conjugating liposomes on the surface of Treg cells. Under the guidance of tumor-oriented chemokines, liposome-anchored Treg cells can be leveraged to migrate and infiltrate the acidic tumor microenvironment, where pH-sensitive liposomes release the loaded cargos [comprising interleukin-, programmed  death ligand 1 antibody (PD-L1), and imiquimod], provoke dramatic dendritic  maturation, block the PD-1/PD-L1 -, elevate the frequency of infiltrating CD8 effector T cells, and collectively contribute to potent inhibition of in situ and metastatic tumors. Here, the findings suggest a potential approach that offers a simple, robust, and safe insight into the tuning of Treg cells as an encouraging vector for augmenting cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634190>  inhibitors in people living with HIV: what about anti-HIV effects?</a></h2><p>:   inhibitors (ICPi) have shown major therapeutic successes when used in various cancers. In the HIV field a double benefit of such ICPi should result from their dual ability to restore in-vitro HIV-specific CD8 T- functions and to enhance HIV production from reservoir cells, thus fulfilling the goals of the 'shock and kill' concept proposed as an HIV cure therapeutic strategy.We conducted a systematic review to identify studies reporting the tolerance profile of ICPi and their effects on HIV plasma loads (pVL), CD4 count, HIV reservoirs (-associated HIV-DNA) and/or HIV-specific CD8 T in PLWH.Thirty-four articles were included for a total 176 participants. 12.1% participants experienced severe adverse events and 49.4% nonsevere adverse events. pVL remained stable in 91.9% participant, showed increases in 5.8% participant, and decreases in .3%. CD4 count remained stable in 60.7% participants, showed increases in 24.6%, and decreases in 14.7%. Regarding ICPi effects on HIV-DNA and HIV-specific immunity, we identified three distinct profiles: profile I, transient pVL increases followed by a boost in HIV-specific CD8 T cells concomitant to a decrease in HIV-DNA, reported in one participant. Profile II: increase in HIV-specific CD8 T cells without changes in pVL or HIV-DNA, reported in three participants. III: no effect, reported in five participants.In conclusion, the clinical, virological and immunological safety profiles of ICPi reported in about 200 PLWH appear to be favorable but their still modest results in terms of HIV cure strategy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680346></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601857>Fucosylated α-acid glycoprotein as a biomarker to predict prognosis following tumor immunotherapy of patients with lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy targeting   molecules has provided remarkable clinical benefits in cancer patients but no clinically relevant biomarker for predicting treatment outcomes exists. Recently, we demonstrated that glycan structures of serum α-acid glycoprotein (AGP) changed dramatically in cancer patients and that α1,3fucosylated AGP (fAGP) levels increased along with disease progression and decreased responding to chemotherapy treatments. Here, the fAGP was analyzed in sera prospectively obtained from 39 patients with advanced lung cancer who underwent immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab. Twenty-three patients had significantly high fAGP levels above the cut-off value (H-fAGP) at one month after starting the treatment and 20 patients in this group, whose tumor sizes did not decrease, maintained high fAGP levels continuously and subsequently died. However, the other 16 patients, whose fAGP levels decreased or maintained below the cut-off value (L-fAGP), survived during a -year observation even though 5 patients in this group had no tumor shrinkage. Accordingly, the overall survival rate was found to significantly correlate with the fAGP level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the H-fAGP was an independent risk factor for cancer progression. Therefore, the fAGP level appeared to be a reliable biomarker for predicting clinical efficacy of immunotherapy with nivolumab.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467175>ERK1/ signaling regulates the  microenvironment and macrophage recruitment in glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>The tumor microenvironment is an important determinant of glioblastoma (GBM) progression and response to treatment. How oncogenic signaling in GBM cells modulates the composition of the tumor microenvironment and its activation is unclear. We aimed to explore the potential local immunoregulatory function of ERK1/ signaling in GBM. Using proteomic and transcriptomic data (RNA seq) available for GBM tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we show that GBM with high levels of phosphorylated ERK1/ have increased infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) with a non-inflammatory M2 polarization. Using three human GBM  lines in culture, we confirmed the existence of ERK1/-dependent regulation of the production of the macrophage chemoattractant CCL2/MCP1. In contrast with this positive regulation of TAM recruitment, we found no evidence of a direct effect of ERK1/ signaling on two other important aspects of TAM regulation by GBM cells: (1) the expression of the   ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, expressed at high mRNA levels in GBM compared with other solid tumors; () the production of the tumor metabolite lactate recently reported to dampen tumor immunity by interacting with the receptor GPR65 present on the surface of TAM. Taken together, our observations suggest that ERK1/ signaling regulates the recruitment of TAM in the GBM microenvironment. These findings highlight some potentially important particularities of the  microenvironment in GBM and could provide an explanation for the recent observation that GBM with activated ERK1/ signaling may respond better to anti-PD1 therapeutics.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656648>Prognostic impact of the Controlling Nutritional Status score in patients with non-small  lung cancer treated with pembrolizumab.</a></h2><p>Pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed  death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody, has been shown to yield a durable response and significant survival benefit in some non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Recent studies have shown that the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score, a novel nutritional index, can be useful for predicting the prognosis in some malignancies. However, its usefulness in predicting the clinical outcome of - inhibitor (ICI) treatment in patients with NSCLC has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of the CONUT score in NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab.We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 32 patients with advanced NSCLC who received pembrolizumab monotherapy. A cut-off CONUT score of  was used to categorize patients into low and high CONUT groups. We evaluated the relation between the clinicopathological factors including CONUT score and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the prognosis.Twenty-two patients were classified into the low CONUT score group, while 10 were classified into the high CONUT score group. In the univariate and multivariate analyses, the number of prior treatments and the CONUT score were found to independently predict progression-free survival (PFS) (P<0.05), while the CONUT score as well as NLR was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P<0.05). In addition, in patients who received pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment, a high CONUT score was associated with a significantly worse PFS and overall survival in comparison to a low CONUT score.The CONUT score has potential application as a predictor of the therapeutic effect and the prognosis of NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab. Our findings suggest that in addition to the programmed  death ligand 1 expression level, the CONUT may also be a useful indicator for selecting NSCLC patients who may benefit from ICI treatment.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Combination strategies of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition with antiangiogenic therapy have the potential for synergistic activity through modulation of the microenvironment and represent a potential therapeutic opportunity in this disease.To evaluate the activity of combined nivolumab and bevacizumab in women with relapsed ovarian cancer.A single-arm, phase  study enrolled patients between February 8, 2017, and December 29, 2017, at  sites in the United States; the primary data analysis was completed July 27, 2018. Thirty-eight women with relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer were enrolled in this study. Participants had disease recurrence within 12 months of their last platinum-based therapy and had received between 1 and 3 lines of prior therapy.Participants received intravenous nivolumab and intravenous bevacizumab once every  weeks.The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1. Secondary end points included evaluation of the ORR by platinum sensitivity, assessment of progression-free survival, assessment of safety data, and investigation of the association of tumor PD-L1 with response to therapy.Of the 38 women enrolled, 18 had platinum-resistant and 20 had platinum-sensitive disease; mean (SD) age was 63.0 (9.1) years. Eleven patients experienced a confirmed response to nivolumab with bevacizumab (ORR, 28.9%; 95% exact binomial CI, 15.4%-45.9%), with 1 additional unconfirmed response. The ORR was 40.0% (19.1%-64.0%) in platinum-sensitive and 16.7% (95% CI 3.6%-41.4%) in platinum-resistant participants. Thirty-four participants (89.5%) experienced at least 1 treatment-related adverse event; 9 participants (23.7%) experienced a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse event. Median progression-free survival was 8.1 months (95% CI, 6.3-14.7 months).

Pro-angiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin- (Ang-) have high expression in glioblastoma in a -specific manner and not only drive tumor angiogenesis and vascular permeability, but also negatively regulate T-lymphocyte and innate   responses. Consequently, the alleviation of immunosuppression might be a prerequisite for successful   therapy in GBM. We here combined anti-angiogenic and   therapy and demonstrated improved therapeutic efficacy in syngeneic, orthotopic GBM models. We observed that blockade of VEGF, Ang-, and programmed  death protein-1 (PD-1) significantly extended survival compared to vascular targeting alone. In the GBM microenvironment, triple therapy increased the numbers of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which inversely correlated with myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells. Transcriptome analysis of GBM microvessels indicated a global vascular normalization that was highest after triple therapy.

However, the safety and efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in patients with preexisting antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are unclear.191 patients treated with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or durvalumab for unresectable advanced cancers between September 2014 and December 2018 were identified retrospectively. Patients were divided into positive (ANA titers ≥ 1:160) and negative ANA groups (ANA titers < 1:160). Development of -related adverse events (irAEs), the overall response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR) were monitored.Positive ANA titers were seen in 9 out of 191 patients. Four patients in the positive ANA group and 69 patients in the negative group developed irAEs of any grade without a significant difference between the groups. The development of endocrine, pulmonary, and cutaneous irAEs was not significant, whereas positive ANA was significantly higher in patients who developed colitis (/9) than in patients who did not (3/182, P = 0.0002). DCR in the positive and negative ANA group was 37.5% and 67.5%, respectively, and was not statistically significant, but had better efficacy in patients without ANA (P = 0.08). ANA-related autoimmune diseases such as SLE, Sjögren's syndrome, MCTD, scleroderma, dermatomyositis, and polymyositis was not induced in either group. However, one patient with preexisting dermatomyositis had a flare up after initiation of atezolizumab.Further studies to identify predictive factors for the development of irAEs are required to provide relevant patient care and maximize the therapeutic benefits of ICIs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471311>A Validation Study on IDO  Biomarkers for Survival Prediction in Non-small  Lung Cancer: Radiation Dose Fractionation Effect in Early Stage Disease.</a></h2><p>We recently reported that indoleamine , 3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity is inversely related to distant metastasis risk and survival in stage III non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). The present study examined whether radiotherapy (RT) dose fractionation correlates with IDO-mediated  activity in patients with early-stage NSCLC.Patients with newly diagnosed stage I-II NSCLC treated with either conventionally fractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) were analyzed. Levels of two key molecules associated with the IDO  , serum kynurenine and the kynurenine:tryptophan ratio (K:T ratio), were measured at pre-RT, during-RT, and 3-month post-RT. The relationship between disease control outcomes [overall survival (OS), progression free survival, and local/regional/distant failure rates] and absolute levels of these markers, as well as dynamic changes in their levels during RT, was studied.Fifty-six patients (SBRT=28, 3DCRT=28) with early stage NSCLC were studied. In all patients, higher kynurenine post-RT was significantly associated with worse OS (HR, 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.55, P=0.044). No statistically significant differences in absolute kynurenine levels or the K:T ratio were observed in patients treated with 3DCRT or SBRT at any of the three time points. However, the absolute kynurenine levels rose significantly post-RT in the 3DCRT patients with the median increase (0.721 ng/mL), whereas SBRT patients did not (0.115 ng/mL); P=0.022.This study validated that elevated IDO activity correlated with worse survival outcomes in patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with definitive RT. Hypofractionated SBRT may have less  suppressive effect than 3DCRT, as measured by IDO.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526274>Complex interactions between the microbiome and cancer  therapy.</a></h2><p>Immuno-oncology has rapidly grown in the last thirty years, and immunotherapeutic agents are now approved to treat many disparate cancers.   inhibitors (ICIs) are employed to augment cytotoxic anti-cancer activity by inhibiting negative regulatory elements of the  system. Modulating the  system to target neoplasms has improved survivability of numerous cancers in many individuals, but forecasting outcomes post therapy is difficult due to insufficient predictive biomarkers. Recently, the tumor and gastrointestinal microbiome and  milieu have been investigated as predictors and influencers of cancer  therapy. In this review, we discuss: (1) ways to measure the microbiome including relevant bioinformatic analyses, () recent developments in animal studies and human clinical trials utilizing gut microbial composition and function as biomarkers of cancer  therapy response and toxicity, and (3) using prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) to modulate  therapy. We discuss the respective benefits of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing including important considerations in obtaining samples and in designing and interpreting human and animal microbiome studies. We then focus on studies discussing the differences in response to ICIs in relation to the microbiome and inflammatory mediators. ICIs cause colitis in up to 25% of individuals, and colitis is often refractory to common immunosuppressive medications. Researchers have measured microbiota composition prior to ICI therapy and correlated baseline microbiota composition with efficacy and colitis. Certain bacterial taxa that appear to enhance therapeutic benefit are also implicated in increased susceptibility to colitis, alluding to a delicate balance between pro-inflammatory tumor killing and anti-inflammatory protection from colitis. Pre-clinical and clinical models have trialed probiotic administration, e.g.  or FMT, to treat colitis when  suppressive agents fail. We are excited about the future of modulating the microbiome to predict and influence cancer outcomes. Furthermore, novel therapies employed for other illnesses including bacteriophage and genetically-engineered microbes can be adapted in the future to promote increased advancements in cancer treatment and side effect management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590677>Predicting response to pembrolizumab in metastatic melanoma by a new personalization algorithm.</a></h2><p>At present,   inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, are widely used in the therapy of advanced non-resectable melanoma, as they induce more durable responses than other available treatments. However, the overall response rate does not exceed 50% and, considering the high costs and low life expectancy of nonresponding patients, there is a need to select potential responders before therapy. Our aim was to develop a new personalization algorithm which could be beneficial in the clinical setting for predicting time to disease progression under pembrolizumab treatment.We developed a simple mathematical model for the interactions of an advanced melanoma tumor with both the  system and the immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab. We implemented the model in an algorithm which, in conjunction with clinical pretreatment data, enables prediction of the personal patient response to the drug. To develop the algorithm, we retrospectively collected clinical data of 54 patients with advanced melanoma, who had been treated by pembrolizumab, and correlated personal pretreatment measurements to the mathematical model parameters. Using the algorithm together with the longitudinal tumor burden of each patient, we identified the personal mathematical models, and simulated them to predict the patient's time to progression. We validated the prediction capacity of the algorithm by the Leave-One-Out cross-validation methodology.Among the analyzed clinical parameters, the baseline tumor load, the Breslow tumor thickness, and the status of nodular melanoma were significantly correlated with the activation rate of CD8+ T cells and the net tumor growth rate. Using the measurements of these correlates to personalize the mathematical model, we predicted the time to progression of individual patients (Cohen's κ = 0.489). Comparison of the predicted and the clinical time to progression in patients progressing during the follow-up period showed moderate accuracy (R = 0.505).Our results show for the first time that a relatively simple mathematical mechanistic model, implemented in a personalization algorithm, can be personalized by clinical data, evaluated before immunotherapy onset. The algorithm, currently yielding moderately accurate predictions of individual patients' response to pembrolizumab, can be improved by training on a larger number of patients. Algorithm validation by an independent clinical dataset will enable its use as a tool for treatment personalization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444618>Clinical difference between discontinuation and retreatment with nivolumab after -related adverse events in patients with lung cancer.</a></h2><p>After the cessation of   inhibitor (ICI) therapy due to an -related adverse event (irAE), it remains unclear whether retreatment with ICI is more effective than its discontinuation. To explore the clinical significance of its retreatment, patients with non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) who had treatment interruption of nivolumab due to irAEs were identified and the clinical differences between discontinuation and retreatment with nivolumab were retrospectively reviewed.49 (26%) of 187 patients treated with nivolumab experienced the cessation of treatment due to a serious irAE. Retreatment was chosen in 21 patients (retreatment cohort), while 28 patients discontinued treatment (discontinuation cohort).The most common irAEs requiring treatment cessation in 49 patients included pneumonitis (59.%), adrenal insufficiency (8.%), liver dysfunction (8.%) renal dysfunction (8.%), colitis (6.1%), hypothyroidism (4.1%), and rash (.0%). The frequency of grade 3 or 4 initial irAEs did not differ between the retreatment and discontinuation cohorts; however, the incidence of renal dysfunction and colitis was higher in the retreatment cohort than in the discontinuation cohort. Retreatment with nivolumab displayed an overall response rate of 15%, without a significant increase in irAEs. The median overall survival and progression-free survival did not differ significantly between the retreatment and discontinuation cohorts, irrespective of the efficacy of prior nivolumab.Retreatment exhibited a slightly higher efficacy without a significant increase in irAEs; however, the clinical significance of retreatment and discontinuation was similar in NSCLC patients that led to treatment interruption due to any irAE after initial nivolumab.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475002>Sequential Anti-PD1 Therapy Following Dendritic  Vaccination Improves Survival in a HER2 Mammary Carcinoma Model and Identifies a Critical Role for CD4 T Cells in Mediating the Response.</a></h2><p>Patients with metastatic HER2 breast cancer (MBC) often become resistant to HER  targeted therapy and have recurrence of disease. The Panacea trial suggested that HER2 MBC patients were more likely to respond to  therapy if TIL were present or if tumor expressed PD-L1. We assessed whether type I polarized dendritic cells (DC1) could improve  therapy in a preclinical model of HER2 breast cancer. TUBO bearing mice were vaccinated with either MHC class I or class II HER2 peptide pulsed DC1 (class I or class II HER2-DC1) concurrently or sequentially with administration of anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL1. Infiltration of tumors by  cells, induction of anti-HER2 immunity and response to therapy was evaluated. Class I or class II HER2-DC1 vaccinated mice generated anti-HER2 CD8 or CD4+ T   responses and demonstrated delayed tumor growth. Combining both MHC class I and II HER2-pulsed DC1 did not further result in inhibition of tumor growth or enhanced survival compared to individual administration. Interestingly class II HER2-DC1 led to both increased CD4 and CD8 T cells in the tumor microenvironment while class I peptides typically resulted in only increased CD8 T cells. Anti-PD-1 but not anti-PD-L1 administered sequentially with class I or class II HER2-DC1 vaccine could improve the efficacy of HER2-DC1 vaccine as measured by tumor growth, survival, infiltration of tumors by T cells and increase in systemic anti-HER2  responses. Depletion of CD4+ T cells abrogated the anti-tumor efficacy of combination therapy with class II HER2-DC1 and anti-PD-1, suggesting that tumor regression was CD4 dependent. Since class II HER2-DC1 was as effective as class I, we combined class II HER2-DC1 vaccine with anti-rat neu antibodies and anti-PD-1 therapy. Combination therapy demonstrated further delay in tumor growth, and enhanced survival compared to control mice. In summary, Class II HER2-DC1 drives both a CD4 and CD8 T  tumor infiltration that leads to increased survival, and in combination with anti-HER2 therapy and  blockade can improve survival in preclinical models of HER2 positive breast cancer and warrants exploration in patients with HER2 MBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482307>A phase II study of the L19IL2 immunocytokine in combination with dacarbazine in advanced metastatic melanoma patients.</a></h2><p>Engineered cytokine products represent promising agents for the treatment of immunogenic tumors, such as malignant melanoma, in addition to   inhibitors. Here we describe the results of a controlled, randomized phase II clinical trial, aimed at assessing the therapeutic potential of L19IL2, a fully human fusion protein consisting of the L19 antibody specific to the alternatively spliced extra-domain B of fibronectin, fused to human interleukin- in advanced metastatic melanoma. In one arm, patients received dacarbazine (DTIC; 1000 mg/m of body surface on day 1 of 21-day cycles) as single agent, while in two other arms L19IL2 (22.5 million international units of IL2 equivalents) was added, based on two different schedules of administration. In total, 69 patients with stage IV melanoma were enrolled (24 in the dacarbazine arm, 23 and 22 in the other combination arms, respectively) and 67 received treatment. Analyses of efficacy results show a statistically significant benefit in terms of overall response rate and median progression-free survival for patients receiving L19IL2 in combination with DTIC, compared to DTIC as single agent. In light of these results, further clinical investigations with L19IL2 (alone or in combination with other agents) are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561913>Human Antigen Leucocyte (HLA)-G and HLA-E are differentially expressed in pancreatic disorders.</a></h2><p>Little information is available regarding the expression of the immunomodulatory Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-G and -E molecules in pancreatic disorders.To analyze HLA-G and -E expression in specimens of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (ACP), idiopathic chronic pancreatitis (ICP), type 1 (T1D) and type  diabetes (T2D) and in histologically normal pancreas (HNP).HLA-G and -E expression (ACP = 30, ICP = 10, T1D = 10, T2D = 30 and HNP = 20) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in three different areas (acini, islets and inflammatory infiltrate).Acini and islets from HNP specimens exhibited higher HLA-G and -E expression compared to corresponding areas from all other patient groups. In inflammatory infiltrate, HLA-G and -E expression was observed only among the pancreatic disorders. We observed higher HLA-G and -E expression in acini from T2D compared to ACP, as well as higher HLA-G expression compared to ICP.The decreased expression of HLA-G and -E in islets and acini together with the expression of these molecules in the inflammatory infiltrating cells were shared features among chronic inflammatory and autoimmune pancreatic disorders evaluated in this study, possibly reflecting tissue damage.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.

Data from the International ImmunoCancer Registry (ICIR).</a></h2><p>To analyse the worldwide occurrence of sicca/Sjögren's (SS) syndrome associated with the use of   inhibitors (ICI) in patients with cancer.The ImmunoCancer International Registry (ICIR) is a Big Data-Sharing multidisciplinary network composed by 40 specialists in Rheumatology, Internal Medicine, Immunology and Oncology from 18 countries focused on the clinical and basic research of the -related adverse events (irAEs) related to cancer immunotherapies. For this study, patients who were investigated for a clinical suspicion of SS after being exposed to ICI were included.We identified 26 patients (11 women and 15 men, with a mean age at diagnosis of 63.57 years). Underlying cancer included lung (n=12), renal (n=7), melanoma (n=4), and other (n=3) neoplasia. Cancer immunotherapies consisted of monotherapy (77%) and combined regimens (23%). In those patients receiving monotherapy, all patients were treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (nivolumab in 9, pembrolizumab in 7 and durvalumab in 4); no cases associated with CTLA-4 inhibitors were identified. The main SS-related features consisted of dry mouth in 25 (96%) patients, dry eye in 17 (65%), abnormal ocular tests in 10/16 (62%) and abnormal oral diagnostic tests in 12/14 (86%) patients. Minor salivary gland biopsy was carried out in 15 patients: histopathological findings consisted of mild chronic sialadenitis in 8 (53%) patients and focal lymphocytic sialadenitis in the remaining 7 (47%); a focus score was measured in 5 of the 6 patients (mean of 1.8, range 1-4). Immunological markers included positive ANA in 13/25 (52%), anti-Ro/ SS-A in 5/25 (20%), RF in /22 (9%), anti-La/SS-B in /25 (8%), low C3/C4 levels in 1/17 (6%) and positive cryoglobulins in 1/10 (10%). Classification criteria for SS were fulfilled by 10 (62%) out of 16 patients in whom the two key classificatory features were carried out. Among the 26 patients, there were only 3 (11%) who presented exclusively with sicca syndrome without organ-specific autoimmune manifestations. Therapeutic management included measures directed to treat sicca symptoms and therapies against autoimmune-mediated manifestations (glucocorticoids in 42%, second/third-line therapies in 31%); therapeutic response for systemic features was observed in 8/11 (73%). No patient died due to autoimmune involvement.Patients with Sjögren's syndrome triggered by ICI display a very specific profile different from that reported in idiopathic primary SS, including more frequent occurrence in men, a higher mean age, a predominant immunonegative serological profile, and a notable development of organ-specific autoimmune involvement in spite of the poor immunological profile. The close association found between sicca/Sjögren's syndrome and primarily PD-1 blockade requires further specific investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547532>Current Possibilities of Gynecologic Cancer Treatment with the Use of   Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Despite the ongoing progress in cancer research, the global cancer burden has increased to 18.1 million new cases and 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Gynecological cancers, such as ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers, considerably contribute to global cancer burden, leading to $5,862.6, $,945.7, and $1,543.9 million of annual costs of cancer care, respectively. Thus, the development of effective therapies against gynecological cancers is still a largely unmet medical need. One of the novel therapeutic approaches is to induce anti-cancer immunity by the inhibition of the   pathways using monoclonal antibodies. The molecular targets for monoclonal antibodies are cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), programmed  death protein-1 (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). The rationale for the use of   inhibitors in patients with gynecological cancers was based on the immunohistological studies showing high expression levels of PD-1 and PD-L1 in those cancers. Currently available   inhibitors include nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, and ipilimumab. The efficacy and safety of these inhibitors, used as monotherapy and with combination with chemotherapy, is being currently evaluated in several clinical studies. As the results are promising, more clinical trials are being planned, which may lead to the development of efficient therapies for gynecological cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498030>Treatment-Free Survival: A Novel Outcome Measure of the Effects of   Inhibition-A Pooled Analysis of Patients With Advanced Melanoma.</a></h2><p>Outcome measures that comprehensively capture attributes of immuno-oncology agents, including prolonged treatment-free time and persistent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), are needed to complement conventional survival end points.We pooled data from the CheckMate 067 and 069 clinical trials of nivolumab and ipilimumab, as monotherapies or in combination, for patients with advanced melanoma. Treatment-free survival (TFS) was defined as the area between Kaplan-Meier curves for two conventional time-to-event end points, each defined from random assignment: time to   inhibitor (ICI) protocol therapy cessation and time to subsequent systemic therapy initiation or death. TFS was partitioned as time with and without toxicity by a third end point, time to cessation of both ICI therapy and toxicity. Toxicity included persistent and late-onset grade 3 or higher TRAEs. The area under each Kaplan-Meier curve was estimated by the 36-month restricted mean time.At 36 months, many of the 1,077 patients who initiated ICI therapy were surviving free of subsequent therapy initiation (47% nivolumab plus ipilimumab, 37% nivolumab, 15% ipilimumab). The restricted mean TFS was longer for nivolumab plus ipilimumab (11.1 months) compared with nivolumab (4.6 months; difference, 6.5 months; 95% CI, 5.0 to 8.0 months) or ipilimumab (8.7 months; difference, .4 months; 95% CI, 0.8 to 4.1 months); restricted mean TFS represented 31% (3% with and 28% without toxicity), 13% (1% and 11%), and 24% (less than 1% and 23%) of the 36-month period, respectively, in the three treatment groups. TFS without toxicity was longer for nivolumab plus ipilimumab than nivolumab (difference, 6.0 months) or ipilimumab (difference, 1.7 months).The analysis of TFS between ICI cessation and subsequent therapy initiation revealed longer TFS without toxicity for patients with advanced melanoma who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab compared with nivolumab or ipilimumab. Regardless of treatment, a small proportion of the TFS involved grade 3 or higher TRAEs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651263>Publication statuses of clinical trials supporting FDA-approved   inhibitors: a meta-epidemiological investigation.</a></h2><p>The low data publication rate for Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, and discrepancies between FDA-submitted versus published data, remain a concern. We investigated the publication statuses of sponsor-submitted clinical trials supporting recent anticancer drugs approved by the FDA, with a focus on   inhibitors (ICPis).We identified all ICPis approved between 2011 and 2014, thereby obtaining 3 years of follow-up data. We assessed the clinical trials performed for each drug indication and matched each trial with publications in the literature. The primary benchmark was the publication status  years post-approval. We examined the association between time to publication and drug type using a multilevel Cox regression model that was adjusted for clustering within drug indications and individual covariates.Between 2011 and 2014, 36 anticancer drugs including 3 ICPis were newly approved by the FDA. Of 19 trials investigating the 3 ICPis, 11 (58%) were published within  years post-approval. We randomly selected 10 of the 33 remaining anticancer drugs; 68 of 101 trials investigating these drugs (67%) were published. Overall, the publication rate was 66% at  years post-approval with a median time to publication of .3 years. There was no significant difference in the time to trial publication between ICPis and other anticancer drugs (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-1.7; P = 0.55). However, findings related to non-ICPis investigated specifically in randomized phase  or phase 3 trials were significantly more likely to be published earlier than those related to ICPis (adjusted HR, 7.4; 95% CI, 1.8-29.5; P = 0.005).One in 3 sponsor-submitted trials of the most recently approved anticancer drugs remained unpublished  years post-FDA approval.

However, the incidence and clinical implication of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in prostate cancer remain poorly understood. The current study aimed to determine the status of PD-1/PD-L1 expression in prostate cancer specimens and its prognostic significance.We immunohistochemically stained for PD-1 and PD-L1 in our tissue microarray (TMA) consisting of radical prostatectomy specimens. The expression of PD-1/PD-L1 was designated as positive when moderate to strong staining or weak staining was seen in at least 1% or 10%, respectively, of tumor cells and/or associated  cells. We then evaluated the relationship between the expression of each protein and clinicopathological features available for our patient cohort.PD-1 and PD-L1 were positive in 3 (1.5%) and 1 (0.5%) of 201 non-neoplastic prostate tissues, and also in 17 (7.7%) and 29 (13.%) of 220 prostate cancers, respectively. PD-1 and PD-L1 were also expressed in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes/macrophages in 172 (78.%) and 33 (15.0%) cases, respectively. PD-L1 expression in tumor cells was more often seen in high pT stage (pT2: 10.8% vs pT3/4: 20.4%; P = .072; pT2/3a: 11.4% vs pT3b/4: 31.6%; P = .013) or lymph node-positive (pN0: 10.1% vs pN1: 27.3%; P = .086) cases, whereas PD-1 expression in tumor cells was not significantly associated with pT/pN stage. In addition, there were no statistically significant associations between PD-1/PD-L1 expression in tumor cells or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes/macrophages versus patient age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, or Gleason score. Kaplan-Meier analysis coupled with log-rank test further revealed no significant associations between PD-1/PD-L1 expression in tumor cells (P = .619/P = .315), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes/macrophages (P = .954/P = .155), or either or both of them (P = .964/P = .767) versus disease recurrence after radical prostatectomy.PD-1/PD-L1 expression was detected in a subset of prostate cancers. In particular, PD-L1 expression was considerably up-regulated in nonorgan-confined tumors. However, PD-1/PD-L1 expression in our TMA was found to be not very helpful in predicting tumor recurrence in prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482256>Enhanced Expression of PD-L1 on Microglia After Surgical Brain Injury Exerts Self-Protection from Inflammation and Promotes Neurological Repair.</a></h2><p>Neuroinflammation and brain edema are major complications in the pathophysiology of surgical brain injury (SBI). Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), an  inhibitory receptor ligand, has been increasingly investigated for inhibition of T -mediated immunity and braking inflammatory response. However, the negative immunomodulatory capacity of PD-L1 and their possible mechanism in SBI is not yet clear. This study aimed to evaluate the expression and the role of PD-L1 in a mouse model of SBI induced inflammation and to further study the potential therapeutic effects of PD-L1 on SBI. Here we showed that PD-L1 expression was markedly elevated in the surrounding peri-resection brain tissue post-SBI in vivo. PD-L1 was up-regulated through ERK signal pathway in LPS-treated BV- cells in vitro. Furthermore, blockade of the PD-L1  using PD-L1 antibody significantly enhanced brain edema, exacerbated apoptosis and increased neurodeficits post-SBI. Moreover, activated PD-1/PD-L1 with PD-L1 protein significantly attenuated the inflammation responses and brain edema post-SBI. These results suggest that enhanced expression of PD-L1 post-SBI exerts self-protection from inflammation and promotes neurological repair.

In this study, we develop a multiplexed   biosensor (MICB) for parallel detection of soluble   PD-1, PD-L1, and LAG-3. MICB integrates a microfluidic sandwich immunoassay using engineered single chain variable fragments and alternating current electrohydrodynamic in situ nanofluidic mixing for promoting biosensor-target interaction and reducing non-specific non-target binding. MICB provides advantages of simultaneous analysis of up to 28 samples in < h, requires as little as a single sample drop (i.e., 20 μL) per target  , and applies high-affinity yeast -derived single chain variable fragments as a cost-effective alternative to monoclonal antibodies. We investigate the assay performance of MICB and demonstrate its capability for accurate   detection in simulated patient serum samples at clinically-relevant levels. MICB provides a dynamic range of 5 to 200 pg mL-1 for PD-1 and PD-L1, and 50 to 1000 pg mL-1 for LAG-3 with a coefficient of variation <13.8%. Sensitive   detection was achieved with limits of detection values of 5 pg mL-1 for PD-1, 5 pg mL-1 for PD-L1, and 50 pg mL-1 for LAG-3. The multiplexing capability, sensitivity, and relative assay simplicity of MICB make it capable of serving as a bioanalytical tool for   therapy monitoring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614500>Detailed Characterization of   Infiltrate and Expression of   Molecules PD-L1/CTLA-4 and MMR Proteins in Testicular Germ  Tumors Disclose Novel Disease Biomarkers.</a></h2><p> The  infiltrate plays an important part in testicular germ  tumors, but it remains scarcely studied.

As ICI is generally only beneficial for a subset of patients, there is a need to select patients that are eligible for therapy as well as to monitor therapy response. There is growing interest to do this noninvasively, by molecular imaging with target-specific tracers. To this day, noninvasive imaging has focused on CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1, while there is no noninvasive tool available to accurately assess LAG-3 expression in vivo. In this proof-of-concept study, we developed nanobodies, the smallest functional fragments from camelid heavy chain-only antibodies, to noninvasively evaluate mouse LAG-3 expression using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT imaging. The in vitro characterization of 114 nanobodies led to the selection of nine nanobodies binding to mouse LAG-3. The injection of Technetium-labeled nanobodies in healthy mice showed specific uptake in  peripheral organs like the spleen and lymph nodes, which was not observed in LAG-3 gene knock-out mice. Moreover, nanobody uptake could be visualized using SPECT/CT and correlated to the presence of LAG-3 as assessed in flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. SPECT/CT scans of tumor bearing mice further confirmed the diagnostic potential of the nanobodies. These findings substantiate the approach to use nanobodies as a tool to image inhibitory   in the tumor environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572198>Antipsychotic Drug Trifluoperazine Suppresses Colorectal Cancer by Inducing G0/G1 Arrest and Apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Repurposing existing drugs for cancer treatment is an effective strategy. An approved antipsychotic drug, trifluoperazine (TFP), has been reported to have potential anticancer effects against several cancer types. Here, we investigated the effect and molecular mechanism of TFP in colorectal cancer (CRC).  studies showed that TFP induced G0/G1   arrest to dramatically inhibit CRC  proliferation through downregulating cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) , CDK4, cyclin D1, and cyclin E and upregulating p27. TFP also induced apoptosis, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased reactive oxygen species levels in CRC cells, indicating that TFP induced mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis. Importantly, TFP significantly suppressed tumor growth in two CRC subcutaneous tumor models without side effects. Interestingly, TFP treatment increased the expression levels of programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) in CRC cells and programmed death-1 (PD-1) in tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, implying that the combination of TFP with an   inhibitor, such as an anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 antibody, might have synergistic anticancer effects. Taken together, our study signifies that TFP is a novel treatment strategy for CRC and indicates the potential for using the combination treatment of TFP and   blockade to increase antitumor efficiency.Copyright © 2019 Xia, Jia, Xue, Jiang, Xie, Wang, Ran, Xu, Zhang and Ye.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443741>Phase I study of samalizumab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma: blockade of the   CD200.</a></h2><p>Samalizumab is a novel recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD200, an immunoregulatory  surface member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that dampens excessive  responses and maintains self-tolerance. This first-in-human study investigated the therapeutic use of samalizumab as a CD200   inhibitor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM).Twenty-three patients with advanced CLL and 3 patients with MM were enrolled in an open-label phase 1 study (). Patients were assigned sequentially to one of 7 dose level cohorts (50 to 600 mg/m) in a 3 + 3 study design, receiving a single dose of samalizumab intravenously once every 28 days. Primary endpoints were safety, identification of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and pharmacokinetics. Secondary endpoints were samalizumab binding to CD200, pharmacodynamic effects on circulating tumor cells and leukocyte subsets, and clinical responses.Twenty-one patients received > 1 treatment . Adverse events (AEs) were generally mild to moderate in severity. Samalizumab produced dose-dependent decreases in CD200 expression on CLL cells and decreased frequencies of circulating CD200 + CD4+ T cells that were sustained at higher doses. The MTD was not reached. Decreased tumor burden was observed in 14 CLL patients. One CLL patient achieved a durable partial response and 16 patients had stable disease. All MM patients had disease progression.Samalizumab had a good safety profile and treatment was associated with reduced tumor burden in a majority of patients with advanced CLL.

We investigated the efficacy of ICIs in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC.Between 2011 and 2018, a total of 14 ALK-positive NSCLC patients treated with ICIs were evaluated retrospectively. Clinicopathologic features including age, PD-L1 expression, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. RNA expression level and cytolytic activity by ALK positivity were analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and National Cancer Center Research Institute (NCCRI) data sets.A total of 13 patients (92.9%) received ALK inhibitors. Patients received a median of three (range -8) courses of therapy. The study included nine patients (64.3%) who were PD-L1-high (>50%) and four (28.6%) who were PD-L1-low (<50%). The objective response rate was 14.3% (/14). The median progression-free survival time was .18 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13 months-not reached [NR]). The median overall survival time was 5.67 months (95% CI 3.00 months-NR). RNA expression levels of CD274 were similar between the ALK-positive and negative groups in both TCGA and NCCRI datasets. RNA levels of CD8A in both TCGA and NCCRI data sets were nonsignificantly lower in the ALK-positive group. Cytolytic activity scores including interferon-γ-related response were lower in the ALK-positive group in the NCCRI but not TCGA dataset.Despite high PD-L1-positive rates, ICIs show limited efficacy in ALK-positive NSCLC.

Recently, anti-PD-1 antibody therapy became a key treatment for stage IV NSCLC as the combination of   inhibitors (ICIs) and platinum doublet chemotherapy. However, the efficacy and toxicity of anti-PD-1 therapy for recurrence after CRT in stage III NSCLC are not well examined.Patients who received anti-PD-1 therapy for recurrence after CRT were identified in our clinical database. The safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy were retrospectively analyzed.From March 1, 2013 to April 30, 2018, there were 20 patients who received anti-PD-1 therapy for recurrence after CRT. The median duration from CRT to initial anti-PD-1 therapy was 9.3 months. 12 patients (60%) were alive and 7 patients (35%) were still receiving anti-PD-1 therapy at the data cutoff point (median follow-up, 13.5 months). The ORR for anti-PD-1 therapy was 45.0%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from initiation of anti-PD-1 therapy was 8.4 months and 26. months, respectively. PFS in patients who had a short interval from last CRT to initial anti-PD-1 therapy seemed to have better outcomes (duration from last CRT to initial anti-PD-1 therapy < 9.3 months vs. ≥ 9.3 months; median PFS, 17.0 months vs. 4.9 months). Grade 3 or 4 -related adverse events occurred in 5% of patients. Only grade 1 pneumonitis was observed.The efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy for recurrence after CRT in stage III NSCLC might better than in stage IV NSCLC.

TNFSF4 is a co-stimulatory  protein expressed by several types of  and non- cells, and was shown in the past to enhance the anti-neoplastic activity of T cells. Here, we assessed its expression in melanoma and its association with outcome in locally advanced and metastatic disease. We used publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer  Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and RNA sequencing data from anti-PD1-treated patients at Sheba medical center. TNFSF4 mRNA is expressed in melanoma  lines and melanoma samples, including those with low lymphocytic infiltrates, and is not associated with the ulceration status of the primary tumor. Low expression of TNFSF4 mRNA is associated with worse prognosis in all melanoma patients and in the cohorts of stage III and stage IIIc-IV patients. Low expression of TNFSF4 mRNAs is also associated with worse prognosis in the subgroup of patients with low lymphocytic infiltrates, suggesting that tumoral TNFSF4 is associated with outcome. TNFSF4 expression was not correlated with the expression of other known  mRNAs. Last, metastatic patients with TNFSF4 mRNA expression within the lowest quartile have significantly worse outcome on anti-PD1 treatment, and a significantly lower response rate to these agents. Our current work points to TNFSF4 expression in melanoma as a potential determinant of prognosis, and warrants further translational and clinical research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631812>A review of  inhibitors in the management of renal  carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Renal  carcinoma is a common malignancy of the genitourinary system and is the eight most common cancer type in the United States. The overall incidence of renal  carcinoma appears to be increasing but death rates have been declining. Patients with poor risk, advanced disease have a two-year survival rate of approximately 7%. Prior to the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, and  inhibitors, IFN-α and high-dose IL-, were standard of care treatment options but, conversely, their use is now limited to select patients. Immunotherapies have played a significant role in the treatment of various cancers and have continued to expand. It is of utmost importance that practitioners include  inhibitors as treatment options for renal  carcinoma as they mark a new era in the treatment of advanced or relapsed setting. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, avelumab, ipilimumab, and atezolizumab all play a role in management of disease as either monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Ongoing clinical trials are ongoing to further assess the benefits of inducing cellular immunity in the treatment of renal  carcinoma.

B7x belongs to the Immunoglobulin superfamily and its protein structure is similar to other members with a N terminus peptide, IgV and IgC like extracellular domain with four cysteine residues. Its receptor is yet to be identified. B7x inhibits T  proliferation and expansion by IL- dependent and non-IL- dependent pathways. Even though high levels of B7x mRNA can be detected in most tissues its protein expression is highly limited suggesting significant post translational control. In vivo data, show that B7x plays an important role in limiting autoimmunity in the peripheral tissues and fine-tuning autoimmune responses. B7x is highly expressed in various cancers and in prostate cancer its expression is corelated with poorer outcomes. Local production of IL-6 and IL-10 in various cancers promotes B7x expression and tumor  evasion. B7x is especially expressed in PD-L1 negative tumors suggesting that this may be an important method of  evasion in these tumors. Currently drug development, targeting B7x through various mechanisms including monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates are in development in cancers and increasing B7x expression with fusion proteins in autoimmune diseases is underway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468288>Game of thrones: immunotherapy versus molecular targeted therapy in renal  cancer scenarios.</a></h2><p>Treatment for advanced renal  carcinoma (RCC) has become increasingly more complex over the last several years. Objective 1 is to which treatment option is immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or the combination of immunotherapy with targeted therapy the best for patients? Objective  is to study which regimens with the highest chance of cure/durable response and what is the optimal sequence in advanced RCC.Between 2016 and 2018, 6 adult patients admitted to our institute with RCC were reviewed.

ICPis are associated with peculiar  side effects, termed -related adverse events (irAEs). Thyroid disfunction is a common irAE, but clinical manifestation, severity, and pathogenesis can be variable. While destructive thyroiditis and hypothyroidism are the most common thyroid irAEs induced by ICPis, autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) is rare. We describe a case of a Graves' disease induced by anti-PD-1 therapy and we review the previous reports on this issue.A 51-year-old man developed an overt autoimmune hyperthyroidism  months after he had started nivolumab (anti-PD-1) therapy for a metastatic non-small  lung cancer. Although TSH-receptor autoantibodies (TRAb) were negative, the persistence of hyperthyroidism, the hypervascular pattern at thyroid ultrasound, and the high uptake at thyroid scintigraphy were all features suggestive of Graves' disease. Methimazole was started with the prompt restoration of euthyroidism. TRAb remained undetectable during the entire follow-up.Autoimmune hyperthyroidism can be induced by anti-PD-1 treatment. TRAb were negative in both cases of nivolumab-induced Graves' disease described to date.

We detail the first report of an elderly woman developing the full triad of APS- shortly after commencing anti-programmed  death protein 1 (anti-PD1)   inhibition for unresectable melanoma and review the literature for similar presentations secondary to anti-PD1 axis therapy.A 78-year-old female with advanced unresectable BRAF wild-type melanoma was treated with pembrolizumab ( mg/kg 3-weekly). Three weeks following the first dose she developed fulminant autoimmune diabetes, with an initially low C-peptide denoting rapid destruction of ß-islet cells. Following stabilisation of her diabetes, two further doses of pembrolizumab was administered. She then represented with symptomatic hypoadrenalism and hypothyroidism, consistent with APS-. Her HLA class II genotype was HLA-DRB1*04.16 (DR4 serotype), a recognised association with this syndrome. Her melanoma responded rapidly to anti-PD1 therapy, and a complete response (CR) was attained after four doses of pembrolizumab. Treatment was discontinued and her CR is ongoing.This is the first report of the full triad of APS- developing in a genetically susceptible individual at the age of 78 after treatment with an anti-PD1 agent. Although scarcely reported, a literature review of similar reports seems to indicate a predilection for this syndrome in patients with HLA-DR4 serotypes. HLA Class II typing is not routinely recommended, but may provide useful predictive information for patients at risk of poly-endocrinopathy even in patients without a relevant personal or family history.

Across Canada, an estimated 1000 new cases of Hodgkin lymphoma are diagnosed each year with more than 70% occurring in patients younger than 55 years. Prognosis is generally dependent on the stage at which Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed and treated. Early Hodgkin lymphoma refers to the disease in stages 1 and , while advanced Hodgkin lymphoma refers to the disease in stages 2B, 3 and 4. The average 5-year relative survival rate in Canada is higher than 90% for patients diagnosed with stages 1 and  Hodgkin lymphoma and 65% for those diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkin lymphoma. Approximately 95% of cases are classified as classical Hodgkin lymphoma which manifests in a variety of forms, namely, nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyte-rich and lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin lymphoma. The remaining 5% of cases are classified as nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment options vary with the type and stage of Hodgkin lymphoma as well as with the patient’s age and overall health. The first line of treatment is typically chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy, although in cases where Hodgkin lymphoma is localized, radiation may be administered as first line therapy. Second-line therapy may include autologous stem  therapy or transplantation (auto-SCT), allogeneic stem  therapy or transplantation (allo-SCT), anti-CD30 antibodies (such as brentuximab vedotin), and anti-CD20 antibodies (such as rituximab). For those whose cancer does not adequately respond to second-line therapy, those who do not have access to therapies like brentuximab vedotin, or those who are ineligible for SCT,   inhibitors (such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab) may be potential options. This review aims to summarize the evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of   inhibitors in brentuximab vedotin-naïve patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma who either failed or are not eligible for auto-SCT.

Much less understood is the unexpected role of macrophages in direct tumor regression. Tumoricidal macrophages can indeed manifest cancer immunoediting activity in the absence of adaptive immunity. We investigated direct macrophage cytotoxicity in malignant pleural mesothelioma, a lethal cancer that develops from mesothelial cells of the pleural cavity after occupational asbestos exposure. In particular, we analyzed the cytotoxic activity of mouse RAW264.7 macrophages upon - contact with autologous AB1/AB12 mesothelioma cells. We show that macrophages killed mesothelioma cells by oxeiptosis via a mechanism involving enhancer of zeste homolog  (EZH2), a histone H3 lysine 27-specific (H3K27-specific) methyltransferase of the polycomb repressive complex  (PRC2). A selective inhibitor of EZH2 indeed impaired RAW264.7-directed cytotoxicity and concomitantly stimulated the PD-1  . In the immunocompetent BALB/c model, RAW264.7 macrophages pretreated with the EZH2 inhibitor failed to control tumor growth of AB1 and AB12 mesothelioma cells. Blockade of PD-1 engagement restored macrophage-dependent antitumor activity. We conclude that macrophages can be directly cytotoxic for mesothelioma cells independent of phagocytosis. Inhibition of the PRC2 EZH2 methyltransferase reduces this activity because of PD-1 overexpression. Combination of PD-1 blockade and EZH2 inhibition restores macrophage cytotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611282>Comprehensive Profiling of Poor-Risk Paired Primary and Recurrent Triple-Negative Breast Cancers Reveals  Phenotype Shifts.</a></h2><p>Emerging data suggest   inhibitors have reduced efficacy in heavily pretreated TNBCs, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To better understand the phenotypic evolution of TNBCs, we studied the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of paired tumors from TNBC patients.We collected paired primary and metastatic TNBC specimens from 43 patients and performed targeted exome sequencing and whole-transcriptome sequencing. From these efforts, we ascertained somatic mutation profiles, tumor mutational burden (TMB), TNBC molecular subtypes, and -related gene expression patterns. Stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (stromal TILs), recurrence-free survival, and overall survival were also analyzed.We observed a typical TNBC mutational landscape with minimal shifts in copy number or TMB over time. However, there were notable TNBC molecular subtype shifts, including increases in the Lehmann/Pietenpol-defined basal-like 1 (BL1, 11.4-22.6%) and mesenchymal (M, 11.4-22.6%) phenotypes, and a decrease in the immunomodulatory phenotype (IM, 31.4-3.%). The Burstein-defined basal-like -activated phenotype was also decreased (BLIA, 42.-17.%). Among down-regulated genes from metastases, we saw enrichment of -related KEGG pathways and GO terms, and decreased expression of immunomodulatory gene signatures (<0.03) and percent stromal TILs (=0.03). There was no clear association between stromal TILs and survival.We observed few mutational shifts, but largely consistent transcriptomic shifts in longitudinally paired TNBCs. Transcriptomic and immunohistochemical analyses revealed significantly reduced -activating gene expression signatures and TILs in recurrent TNBCs. These data may explain the observed lack of efficacy of immunotherapeutic agents in heavily pretreated TNBCs.

Although anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is a well-studied biomarker for response to anti-programmed death-1 PD-1 therapy in melanoma, its clinical relevance remains unclear. It has been established that the high expression of indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is correlated to a response to anti-CTLA-4 treatment in melanoma. However, it is still unknown whether the IDO expression is associated with response to anti-PD-1 therapy in advanced melanoma. In addition, acral and mucosal melanomas, which comprise a great proportion of all melanomas in Asians, are genetically different subtypes from cutaneous melanomas; however, they have not been independently analyzed due to their low frequency in Western countries. To evaluate the association of IDO and PD-L1 expression with response to anti-PD-1 antibody in acral and mucosal melanoma patients, we analyzed 32 Japanese patients with acral and mucosal melanomas treated with anti-PD-1 antibody from the perspective of IDO and PD-L1 expression levels by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Multivariate Cox regression models showed that the low expression of IDO in tumors was associated with poor progression-free survival (HR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.13-0.81, P = 0.016), whereas PD-L1 expression on tumors was not associated with progression-free survival. Significantly lower expression of IDO in tumors was found in non-responders compared to responders. Assessment of the IDO expression could be useful for the identification of suitable candidates for anti-PD-1 therapy among acral and mucosal melanomas patients.

Odds ratios for irN improvement/resolution were as follows: 1.40 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.03-68.72], 0.43 (95% CI, 0.04-4.22), .60 (95% CI, 0.07-97.24), 0.36 (95% CI, 0.03-4.38), 4.02 (95% CI, 0.16-99.48), .01 (95% CI, 0.32-12.70), 1.08 (95% CI, 0.02-49.89), 0.42 (95% CI, 0.06-.91), and .73 (95% CI, 0.42-17.51) for granulocyte hyperplasia, granulocyte/all lineage hypoplasia, granulocyte maturation blockade, lymphocyte infiltration on bone marrow biopsy, IV corticosteroids, PO corticosteroids, cyclosporine, IVIG, and GCSF, respectively (P>0.05 for all factors). IrN recurrence rate following   inhibitors rechallenge was 80%. IrN is a rare, life-threatening, early-onset -related adverse event. Differentiating between the central, peripheral, and modified peripheral types allows a better prognosis definition. Corticosteroids and GCSF represent the main treatment approaches; IVIG and cyclosporine should be used as salvage treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677498>Evaluation of the prognostic role of platelet-lymphocyte ratio in cancer patients treated with   inhibitors: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Whether platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is a prognostic factor for cancer patients treated with immunotherapy is under debate. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between PLR and survival of cancer patients treated with   inhibitors (ICIs).A systematical search was performed in databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library to retrieve potential eligible clinical studies assessing the prognosis of cancer patients with high versus low PLR after immunotherapy, from the establishment of the database to June 2019. Quality evaluation of included studies was performed, and meta-analyses with regards to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were conducted using RevMan 5.3 and STATA 11.A total of 12 eligible studies with 1340 cancer patients were included. Combined results showed that elevated PLR was a negative factor affecting the efficacy of ICIs in cancer patients. Patients with high PLR had a significantly shorter OS compared to those with low PLR (hazard ratio (HR) = .02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.46 to .80, P < 0.0001), as well as PFS (HR = 1.74, 95%CI: 1.27 to .38, P = 0.0006). Similar results were observed in sensitivity analyses. Subgroup analyses revealed that the prognostic role of PLR on OS and PFS was dependent on cancer type, region, and cutoff value. For NSCLC patients, the disease stage, ICIs agent, and line of treatment may not influence the prognostic role of PLR.PLR could be a routinely potential prognostic factor for ICIs. Low PLR may be associated with better survival for cancer patients when treated with immunotherapy.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In chronic viral infections and cancer, where antigens can persistently stimulate the  system,   molecules can serve as a barrier to effective  responses. The role of   molecules in the setting of systemic low grade inflammatory such as Aging and ART-suppressed HIV infection is not known. In this study, we made use of stored samples from the FLORAH cohort of HIV-infected, ART suppressed adults (age range 19-77 yrs.) and age-matched HIV uninfected controls. We measured the expression levels of   molecules: PD-1, LAG-3, TIGIT, TIM-3, and 2B4 on resting CD4 and CD8 T cells and maturation subsets. To determine how expression of these molecules can affect T  function, we stimulated PBMC with HIV Gag or p09/H1N1 antigen and performed intracellular cytokine staining by multi-parameter flow cytometry.   molecules were expressed at higher levels in CD8 compared to CD4. PD-1 was the only molecule that remained significantly higher in HIV-individuals compared to controls. LAG-3 expression increased with age in CD4 and CD8 T cells. 2B4 expression on CD8 T cells was negatively associated with IL- production but showed no effect on CD4 T  function. TIM-3 expression was negatively associated with IL-21 production in CD4 and CD8 T cells and also negatively correlated with flu vaccine responses in HIV negative individuals. Taken altogether, this study demonstrates the marked variation in   molecule expression in T cells among adults and sheds light on the biology of these molecules and their effects on antigen-specific T  functions. Overall, our results point to TIM-3 as a potential biomarker for  function in HIV+ individuals on ART.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550464>Lymphovascular Invasion Is Associated with Mutational Burden and PD-L1 in Resected Lung Cancer.</a></h2><p>High tumor mutational burden (TMB) and PD-L1 expression are leading biomarkers in metastatic non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) and predict favorable response to  inhibitors. We sought to identify clinicopathologic characteristics associated with elevated TMB and PD-L1 expression among patients who underwent resection for NSCLC.NSCLC patients undergoing primary resection (2016-2018) were prospectively enrolled in an immunogenomic profiling project (ICON). Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) quantified densities (cells/mm) of CD3, CD3CD8, CD3CD8PD-1, malignant cells (MCs), MCsPD-L1, CD68, CD68PD-L1, and CD20 cells. Whole exome sequencing quantified TMB (mutations/megabase). TMB and MCsPD-L1 were dichotomized according to the median of each.55 patients completed mIF and WES profiling. 41.8% (23/55) had pathologic stage I disease. Median TMB and MCsPD-L1 were 3.91 and 0.62 cells/mm, respectively. TMB was higher among smokers (p=0.001) and tumors with lymphovascular invasion (LVI)(p=0.051). TMB was positively correlated with densities of MCsPD-L1 (r=0.293,p=0.030), CD68PD-L1 (r=0.289, p=0.033), and CD20 (r=0.310,p=0.043) cells. The density of MCsPD-L1 was associated with increased CD3CD8 (r=0.319,p=0.018) and CD68PD-L1 (r=0.371,p=0.005) cells. Patients with PD-L1TMB tumors (30.9%, 17/55) had higher intratumoral densities of CD3, CD3CD8, CD68, CD68PD-L1, and CD20 cells. On multivariable analysis LVI was associated with synchronous elevated TMB and PD-L1 expression (OR 3.53,p=0.039).NSCLC tumors with elevated TMB and PD-L1 expression are associated with LVI and increased intratumoral   infiltration. These findings may potentially improve patient selection for  inhibitor therapy trials in the adjuvant setting.Copyright © 2019.

Immunotherapies such as those that target   molecules can be used to augment -mediated elimination of tumours and have resulted in durable responses in patients with cancer that did not respond to previous treatments. However, only a subset of patients benefit from immunotherapy and more knowledge about what is required for successful treatment is needed. Although the role of tumour neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells in tumour rejection is well established, the roles of other subsets of T cells have received less attention. Here we show that spontaneous and immunotherapy-induced anti-tumour responses require the activity of both tumour-antigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells, even in tumours that do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. In addition, the expression of MHC class II-restricted antigens by tumour cells is required at the site of successful rejection, indicating that activation of CD4 T cells must also occur in the tumour microenvironment. These findings suggest that MHC class II-restricted neoantigens have a key function in the anti-tumour response that is nonoverlapping with that of MHC class I-restricted neoantigens and therefore needs to be considered when identifying patients who will most benefit from immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484422>Tumor-Targeted Drug Conjugates as an Emerging Novel Therapeutic Approach in Small  Lung Cancer (SCLC).</a></h2><p>There are few effective therapies for small  lung cancer (SCLC), a highly aggressive disease representing 15% of total lung cancers. With median survival < years, SCLC is one of the most lethal cancers. At present, chemotherapies and radiation therapy are commonly used for SCLC management. Few protein-targeted therapies have shown efficacy in improving overall survival;   inhibitors (ICIs) are promising agents, but many SCLC tumors do not express ICI targets such as PD-L1. This article presents an alternative approach to the treatment of SCLC: the use of drug conjugates, where a targeting moiety concentrates otherwise toxic agents in the vicinity of tumors, maximizing the differential between tumor killing and the cytotoxicity of normal tissues. Several tumor-targeted drug conjugate delivery systems exist and are currently being actively tested in the setting of SCLC. These include antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), radioimmunoconjugates (RICs), small molecule-drug conjugates (SMDCs), and polymer-drug conjugates (PDCs). We summarize the basis of action for these targeting compounds, discussing principles of construction and providing examples of effective versus ineffective compounds, as established by preclinical and clinical testing. Such agents may offer new therapeutic options for the clinical management of this challenging disease in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576688>Investigating the role of immunotherapy in advanced/recurrent female genital tract melanoma: a preliminary experience.</a></h2><p>immunotherapy with   inhibitors has become one of the standard therapeutic modalities for patients with advanced melanoma. Melanoma of the female lower genital tract is a rare and aggressive disease, with poor long-term clinical outcomes. To date, no study evaluated the role of immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma of the lower genital tract.Data of women with metastatic melanoma of the lower genital tract were prospectively collected. Survival outcomes over time was assessed using Kaplan-Meier model.Seven cases of metastatic melanoma of the lower genital tract (vulva [n=], vagina [n=4], and uterine cervix [n=1]) treated with   inhibitors are reviewed. Two patients had metastatic disease at diagnosis, while 5 patients developed metastatic disease at a mean (standard deviation) time of 9.9 (±3.0) months from primary diagnosis. Four patients received an anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) (ipilimumab) and 3 received an anti-programmed  death 1 (PD-1) (pembrolizumab [n=], nivolumab [n=1]) therapy. The response rate to immunotherapy was 28.5%. Patients receiving an anti-PD-1 experienced a better progression-free survival than patients treated with anti-CTLA4 (p=0.01, log-rank test). Although not reaching statistical significance, overall survival was better in patients having an anti-PD-1 therapy in comparison to anti-CTLA4 (p=0.15, log-rank test).Results from our series confirm the poor prognosis of women with metastatic melanoma of the lower genital tract, thus supporting the need of exploring new treatment modalities. Further studies are warranted to improve knowledge on the role of immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma of the lower genital tract.Copyright © 2019.

Some of this resistance has been attributed to the upregulation of   such as programmed  death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, PD-L1 in Her2-positive breast cancer patients. Therefore, therapies targeting both the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and oncogenic Her2 signaling are of significant clinical interest. Here, we constructed a mouse bispecific antibody targeting PD-L1 and rat Her2 (referred to as BsPD-L1xrErbB2) aiming to redirect the anti-PD-L1 response toward Her2-expressing tumor cells. BsPD-L1xrErbB2 demonstrated additive binding to interferon (IFN)-γ treated Her2 TUBO tumor cells, but it did not affect the proliferation of tumor cells . BsPD-L1xrErbB2 also blocked the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. This bispecific antibody was constructed with a mouse IgG2a Fc backbone and interacted with Fcγ receptors and resulted in complement deposition (C3). ADCC and complement action could be potential mechanisms of action of this molecule. BsPD-L1xrErbB2 successfully reduced TUBO tumor growth and increased tumor rejection rate compared to the monovalent anti-PD-L1, monovalent anti-ErbB2 or the combination of anti-PD-L1 and anti-ErbB2 monotherapies. The enhanced anti-tumor effect of BsPD-L1xrErbB2 was dependent on CD8 T lymphocytes and IFN-γ, as depletion of CD8 T lymphocytes and neutralization of IFN-γ completely abolished the antitumor activity of the bispecific antibody. Consistently, BsPD-L1xrErbB2 treatment also increased the frequency of intratumor CD8 T lymphocytes. Taken together, our data support a bispecific antibody approach to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1  blockade in Her2-positive metastatic breast cancers.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498180>Association of Insurance Status With Presentation, Treatment, and Survival in Melanoma in the Era of   Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>The effect of health insurance on management and outcomes in melanoma is unclear. Using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), we evaluated the effect of insurance on (1) stage at diagnosis, () receipt of immunotherapy, and (3) overall survival (OS) among patients with melanoma. We included patients with stage I-IV melanoma diagnosed from 2011 to 2015. Patients were stratified by age (below 65 vs. 65 y or above) and insurance (commercial, Medicare, Medicaid and uninsured). We evaluated the association between insurance and (1) stage at diagnosis (stage I-III vs. IV) and () receipt of immunotherapy (stage IV) using multivariable logistic regression. The association of insurance status with OS in metastatic patients who received immunotherapy was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses. The study included 167,130 patients; 52% had commercial insurance, 43% had Medicare, 3% had Medicaid and % were uninsured. In patients below 65 years, those with Medicaid and the uninsured had a higher likelihood of presenting with metastatic melanoma and were less likely to receive immunotherapy compared with those with commercial insurance. Further among those who received immunotherapy, patients with Medicaid (hazard ratio: 1.51, P=0.001) and no insurance (hazard ratio: 1.37, P=0.046) had an inferior OS. In patients 65 years or above, whereas Medicare was associated with an increased likelihood of presenting with metastatic disease, there was no significant difference in receipt of immunotherapy or OS as compared with commercial insurance. In this large modern cohort, insurance was associated with stage at diagnosis, receipt of immunotherapy, and OS for patients below 65 years old with melanoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473121>Importance of Multiparametric Evaluation of -Related T- Markers in Renal- Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapeutic therapies such as   inhibitors have been used in patients with renal  carcinoma (RCC). To overcome therapeutic resistance or identify predictive markers, a comprehensive understanding of the immunologic condition in the tumor microenvironment is important. We reviewed the latest scientific findings on the comprehensive immunologic condition within the tumor microenvironment in patients with RCC and its clinical significance. The immunologic condition evaluated by 3 different methods (flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and next-generation sequencing) in 4 different cohorts of patients with RCC could commonly divide the immunologic condition into  or 3 groups, all of which were significantly correlated with tumor aggressiveness and patient prognosis. In particular, patients with high T- infiltration and immunosuppressive cells including regulatory T cells had the worst prognosis in each cohort. This classification correlated with angiogenesis and metabolism and glycolysis, and it suggested that distinct biology exists in each immunologic classification. Moreover, around 20% to 30% of the RCC patients had intratumor immunologic diversity within each individual; this might help in understanding the presence of radiologic heterogeneity for immunotherapies. In conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of the  condition is needed for the upcoming era of novel cancer immunotherapy using not only genetic but also phenotypic and functional classifications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Programmed death ligand-1 (PDL1) is an   inhibitor, instrumental in 'T  escape' of malignant cells. PDL1 has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis in multiple small studies. In this study, we want to study the role of PDL1 as a prognostic marker in RCC in an Indian population.A total of 30 patients who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy, with histopathological findings of RCC, were included in the study. PDL1 expression was studied in tumour tissue with immunohistochemistry. Patients were followed up for a period of  years for disease recurrence and cancer-specific mortality.Expression of PDL1 was seen to be associated with higher grade and stage at presentation. PDL1 expression was also associated with statistically significant increased incidence of disease recurrence. Although cancer-specific mortality was higher in patients with positive PDL1 expression, it was seen to be statistically insignificant.PDL1 is a novel prognostic marker for RCC and is associated with poor prognosis. More studies with larger patient pool and multicentric studies will establish the role of PDL1 with certainty.

Oncogenic mutations in , , ,  and  and the promoter region of telomerase reverse transcriptase () were investigated using the Sanger sequencing. The expression and copy number of programmed death-ligand 1 () were also assessed.Mutations in , , and  promoter were identified in 13.9% (5/36), .9% (1/34), and 5.6% (/36) of the primary vaginal melanomas, respectively.  expression and amplification were observed in 27.8% (10/36) and 5.6% (/36) of cases, respectively.  positive expression and/or amplification was associated with older patients ( = .008). Patients who had  mutations had a poorer overall survival compared with those with a wild-type  (33.5 vs. 14.0 months; hazard ratio [HR], 3.09; 95% CI, 1.08-8.83). Strikingly, two patients with/without  expression receiving   inhibitors had a satisfying outcome. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that >10 mitoses per mm (HR, .96; 95% CI, 1.03-8.51) was an independent prognostic factor. mutations and  expression were most prevalent in our cohort of primary vaginal melanomas and can be potentially considered as therapeutic targets.This study used the Sanger sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence in situ hybridization methods to detect common genetic mutations and  expression and copy number in 36 primary vaginal melanomas.  mutations and  expression were the most prevalent, but  and  mutations occurred at a lower occurrence in this rare malignancy.

A non-invasive imaging agent with rapid clearance rate would be an ideal tool to predict and monitor the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy. The aim of this research was to engineer a subnanomolar, high-affinity fibronectin type 3 domain (FN3)-based small binder targeted against human PD-L1 (hPD-L1) present on tumor cells. A naive yeast G4 library containing the FN3 gene with three binding loop sequences was used to isolate high-affinity binders targeted to purified full-length hPD-L1. The selected binder clones displayed several mutations in the loop regions of the FN3 domain. One unique clone (FN3hPD-L1-01) with a 6x His-tag at the C-terminus had a protein yield of >5 mg/L and a protein mass of 12 kDa. In vitro binding assays on six different human cancer  lines (MDA-MB-231, DLD1, U87, 293 T, Raji and Jurkat) and murine CT26 colon carcinoma cells stably expressing hPD-L1 showed that CT26/hPD-L1 cells had the highest expression of hPD-L1 in both basal and IFN-γ-induced states, with a binding affinity of .38 ± 0.26 nM for FN3hPD-L1-01. The binding ability of FN3hPD-L1-01 was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining on ex vivo CT26/hPD-L1 tumors sections. The FN3hPD-L1-01 binder represents a novel, small, high-affinity binder for imaging hPD-L1 expression on tumor cells and would aid in earlier imaging of tumors. Future clinical validation studies of the labeled FN3hPD-L1 binder(s) have the potential to monitor   inhibitors therapy and predict responders.© The Author(s) 2019.

This has led to requests from clinicians to retest recurrences of MMR proficient primary tumours in the hope that the recurrence may show a different MMR status and qualify the patient for treatment. We aimed to determine whether repeat testing is warranted.We evaluated recurrent tumours (local recurrences or metastases) from 137 patients with MMR proficient primary tumours of the gastrointestinal and gynaecological tracts. The local recurrences and metastases all occurred at least 30 days after resection of the primary tumour. We used a combination of a tissue microarray (TMA) and whole slide staining to perform immunohistochemistry (IHC) for PMS2, MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 and compared the results to the MMR status of the primary tumour. 3/137 (%) initially showed a discordant staining pattern. However, further investigation showed that these discordances were attributed to some of the known pitfalls associated with MMR IHC interpretation - post radiotherapy loss of MSH6 expression and subclonal loss of MLH1 staining. We did not identify any cases with a genuine discordance in MMR status.We conclude that repeat MMR IHC testing of recurrences is not warranted as the MMR status does not change relative to that of the primary tumour.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575354>Behcet's-like syndrome following pembrolizumab: An -related adverse event associated with programmed death receptor-1 inhibitor therapy.</a></h2><p>The landscape for the treatment of metastatic melanoma has been revolutionized with the introduction   inhibitors.   inhibitors have now become the standard of care for the treatment of cancers.

The majority of HD-IL- complete responders (27/28) remained in remission during the extent of follow-up after CR (median: 40 months). Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. Higher number of infused cells was associated with a favorable response. The ORR for HD-IL- compared favorably to the nivolumab/ipilimumab combination following anti-PD-1 failure.TIL-ACT therapy, especially when combined with HD-IL-, achieves durable clinical benefit and warrants further investigation. We discuss the current position of TIL-ACT in the therapy of advanced melanoma, particularly in the era of   blockade therapy, and review future opportunities for improvement of this approach.© The Author 2019.

This study assessed these endpoints in patients with melanoma treated with anti-PD-1 with or without ipilimumab.This study retrospectively evaluated 344 patients with metastatic melanoma treated with anti-PD-1 or a combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from 2009 to 2018. The incidence, types, grades, management, and outcomes of -related adverse events (irAEs) and hospitalizations for irAEs and disease progression were assessed.Patients on combination therapy were more likely to develop irAEs than those on monotherapy (72% vs 37%; P < .001) and were more likely to require systemic steroids (61% vs 20%; P < .001), steroid dose re-escalation (23% vs 6%; P < .001), and second-line immunosuppressive use (17% vs %; P < .001) and to suffer high-dose steroid-refractory toxicities (23% vs 3%; P < .001). Combination-treated patients were more likely to have any hospitalization (32% vs 7%; P < .001) or multiple hospitalizations for irAEs (11% vs 3%; P = .001) and had a longer average time of hospitalization (mean, 1.92 vs 0.62 days; P = .002). Among 176 hospitalizations related to disease progression in patients who died during evaluable follow-up, 69% occurred within the 90 days before death. Early hospitalizations for disease-related reasons portended a very poor prognosis (median time from admission to death, 58 days).Patients treated with a combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab had higher rates of hospitalization and steroid-refractory toxicities than those treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy. Disease-associated hospitalizations were similar between the  groups, portended a poor prognosis, and mostly occurred in the last months of life.© 2019 American Cancer Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563735>Impact of EGFR-TKIs combined with PD-L1 antibody on the lung tissue of EGFR-driven tumor-bearing mice.</a></h2><p>EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been the standard treatment for non-small  lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations. However, most patients eventually develop resistance. With the development of   inhibitors targeting the programmed  death receptor/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1), there is a growing interest in developing combination strategies. However, there are concerns that the combination of a PD-(L)1 inhibitor and EGFR-TKI may be associated with an increased risk of pneumonitis. Therefore, we utilized an established EGFR-driven tumor-bearing mouse model to investigate whether the combination would induce pneumonitis in mouse lung tissue.Mice were treated with monotherapy or combined therapy of PD-L1 antibody and EGFR-TKIs including first-generation gefitinib and third-generation osimertinib. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) and lung tissues were collected for analysis at the end of treatment.The osimertinib and anti-PD-L1 combined treatment group had the highest inflammation scores in pathologic grades of H&E staining of lung tissue and had the highest percentages of myeloperoxidase positive cells. However, combining gefitinib and anti-PD-L1 treatment appeared to not increase the level of pneumonitis in mice. Total  counts, neutrophil counts and total protein concentration in BALFs were also significantly increased in the osimertinib and anti-PD-L1 combined treatment group. We next evaluated proinflammatory factors in BALFs. The levels of IFN-γ, IL-, IL-5, TNF-α and IL-12p70 were increased in osimertinib and anti-PD-L1 combined treatment group. Comparison of different sequences of drug administration demonstrated that mice treated with osimertinib followed by PD-L1 antibody did not show evident lung inflammation. Our findings indicate that osimertinib, rather than gefitinib combined with anti-PD-L1 treatment could lead to lung injury in an EGFR mutated tumor-bearing mouse model. The sequence and timing of combining EGFR-TKI and PD-L1 antibody may influence the severity of pneumonitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we describe the patterns of CMTM6 expression and assess its association with response to PD-1 pathway blockade in non-small- lung cancer (NSCLC).We used multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence to determine the expression of CMTM6 and PD-L1 in 438 NSCLCs represented in tissue microarrays, including two independent retrospective cohorts of immunotherapy treated (n = 69) and untreated (n = 258) patients, and a third collection of EGFR and KRAS genotyped tumors (n = 111).Tumor and stromal CMTM6 expression was detected in approximately 70 % of NSCLCs. CMTM6 expression was not associated with clinical features or EGFR/KRAS mutational status and showed a modest correlation with T- infiltration (R < 0.40). We found a significant correlation between CMTM6 and PD-L1, higher in the stroma (R = 0.51) than tumor cells (R = 0.35). In our retrospective NSCLC cohort, neither CMTM6 nor PD-L1 expression alone significantly predicted immunotherapy outcomes. However, high CMTM6 and PD-L1 co-expression in the stroma and CD68 compartments (adjusted HR 0.38, p = 0.03), but not in tumor cells (p = 0.15), was significantly associated with longer OS in treated patients, but not observed in the absence of immunotherapy.This study supports the mechanistic role for CMTM6 in stabilization of PD-L1 in patient tumors and suggests that high co-expression of CMTM6 and PD-L1, particularly in stromal -cells (macrophages), might identify the greatest benefit from PD-1 axis blockade in NSCLC.Copyright © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

Here, we describe a case of acute pneumonitis during durvalumab administration for locally advanced NSCLC, causing persistent symptomatology and steroid treatment to date. To our knowledge, acute-onset pneumonitis during infusion of a PD-L1 inhibitor has not been described previously. This case illustrates that ICI-induced pneumonitis can occur anytime during treatment, especially after chemoradiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464648>A PD-L2-based  marker signature helps to predict survival in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>Programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) is a key   that regulates peripheral tolerance and protects against autoimmunity. Programmed death ligand- (PD-L2) is a less studied ligand to PD-1 and has yet to be fully explored, especially in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).In this study, we performed immunohistochemistry to detect the PD-L2, CD3, CD8, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and FOXP3 levels in paraffin sections from 305 patients with resected PDAC as a training set. Expression levels of intratumoral and stromal  markers were compared in relation to survival using Kaplan-Meier curves, random survival forest model and survival tree analysis. A multivariable Cox proportional-hazards model of associated markers was used to calculate the risk scores.PD-L2 was expressed in 71.5% of PDAC samples and showed strong correlations with CD3+, CD8+ T cells and FOXP3+ regulatory T  densities. High levels of intratumoral PD-L2 and FOXP3 were related to poor survival; only stromal FOXP3 overexpression was associated with worse prognosis. Four patterns generated from survival tree analysis demonstrated that PD-L2FOXP3 patients had the longest survival, while PD-L2CD3 patients had the shortest survival (P <  0.001). The area under the curve was 0.631(95% confidence interval (CI): 0.447-0.826) for the  marker-based signature and 0.549 (95% CI: 0.323-0.829; P <  0.001) for the clinical parameter-based signature, which was consistent with the results in the validation set including 150 patients (P <  0.001). A higher risk score indicated shorter survival and could serve as an independent prognostic factor. PD-L2 was also showed associated with TGF-β and other  molecules based on bioinformatics analysis.Our work highlighted PD-L2 as a promising immunotherapeutic target with prognostic value combined with complex tumor infiltrating cells in PDAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454760>Increased frequency of anti-Ma2 encephalitis associated with   inhibitors.</a></h2><p>To report the induction of anti-Ma2 antibody-associated paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome (Ma2-PNS) in 6 patients after treatment with   inhibitors (ICIs). We also analyzed (1) patient clinical features compared with a cohort of 44 patients who developed Ma2-PNS without receiving ICI treatment and () the frequency of neuronal antibody detection before and after ICI implementation.Retrospective nationwide study of all patients with Ma2-PNS developed during ICI treatment between 2017 and 2018.Our series of patients included 5 men and 1 woman (median age, 63 years). The patients were receiving nivolumab (n = 3), pembrolizumab (n = ), or a combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (n = 1) for treatment of neoplasms that included lung (n = 4) and kidney (n = 1) cancers and pleural mesothelioma (n = 1). Clinical syndromes comprised a combination of limbic encephalitis and diencephalitis (n = 3), isolated limbic encephalitis (n = ), and a syndrome characterized by ophthalmoplegia and head drop (n = 1). No significant clinical difference was observed between our 6 patients and the overall cohort of Ma2-PNS cases. Post-ICI Ma2-PNS accounted for 35% of the total 17 Ma2-PNS diagnosed in our center over the 2017-2018 biennium. Eight cases had been detected in the preceding biennium 2015-2016, corresponding to a 112% increase of Ma2-PNS frequency since the implementation of ICIs in France. Despite ICI withdrawal and immunotherapy, 4/6 patients died, and the remaining  showed a moderate to severe disability.We show a clear association between ICI use and increased diagnosis of Ma2-PNS. Physicians need to be aware that ICIs can trigger Ma2-PNS because clinical presentation can be challenging.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

An important target of these drugs is the PD-L1/PD-1 ligand/receptor pair and several clinically available inhibitors of this pair exist.A search of the literature until April 20, 2019 was performed in the MEDLINE/PubMed database, the Embase database and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The clinical studies describing treatment with PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors as monotherapy in HCC patients were retrieved. Patient characteristics with relevance for treatment efficacy, such as liver function, disease extend and previous treatment, were extracted from identified articles. Response and survival outcomes were the primary focus of the meta-analysis. Summary estimates of response rates and survival were calculated using a random or fixed effect model, depending on heterogeneity. Most common adverse effects were also recorded and summarized.Three studies (two on nivolumab and one on pembrolizumab) with a total of 400 patients were included in the analysis. The summary response rate (RR) was 17.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 13.%-21.4%]. The summary disease control rate (DCR) was 56.6% (95% CI: 44.7%-68.5%). Summary progression free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months (95% CI: .8-4. months). Summary overall survival (OS) was 10.4 months (95% CI: 3.5-17. months). Adverse effect rate was low and also consistent with the adverse effect profile of PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors in other disease locations.Pembrolizumab and nivolumab are the only  inhibitors with data in HCC. Meta-analysis of their effectiveness discloses rates not dissimilar to other systemic therapies available for this disease. Of interest also are the observed long responses in a sub-set of responders. Further development is clearly warranted.Copyright © 2019.

We report the final analysis from our study of the   PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced oesophageal squamous  carcinoma.We did a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (ATTRACTION-3) at 90 hospitals and cancer centres in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the UK, and the USA. We enrolled patients aged 20 years and older with unresectable advanced or recurrent oesophageal squamous  carcinoma (regardless of PD-L1 expression), at least one measurable or non-measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and who were refractory or intolerant to one previous fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based chemotherapy and had a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either nivolumab (240 mg for 30 min every  weeks) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel 100 mg/m for at least 60 min once per week for 6 weeks then 1 week off; or docetaxel 75 mg/m for at least 60 min every 3 weeks), all given intravenously. Treatment continued until disease progression assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was done using an interactive web response system with a block size of four and stratified according to geographical region (Japan vs rest of the world), number of organs with metastases, and PD-L1 expression. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause, in the intention-to-treat population that included all randomly assigned patients. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number , and follow-up for long-term outcomes is ongoing.Between Jan 7, 2016, and May 25, 2017, we assigned 419 patients to treatment: 210 to nivolumab and 209 to chemotherapy. At the time of data cutoff on Nov 12, 2018, median follow-up for overall survival was 10·5 months (IQR 4·5-19·0) in the nivolumab group and 8·0 months (4·6-15·) in the chemotherapy group. At a minimum follow-up time (ie, time from random assignment of the last patient to data cutoff) of 17·6 months, overall survival was significantly improved in the nivolumab group compared with the chemotherapy group (median 10·9 months, 95% CI 9·-13·3 vs 8·4 months, 7·-9·9; hazard ratio for death 0·77, 95% CI 0·62-0·96; p=0·019). 38 (18%) of 209 patients in the nivolumab group had grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events compared with 131 (63%) of 208 patients in the chemotherapy group. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (four [%]) in the nivolumab group and decreased neutrophil count (59 [28%]) in the chemotherapy group. Five deaths were deemed treatment-related: two in the nivolumab group (one each of interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis) and three in the chemotherapy group (one each of pneumonia, spinal cord abscess, and interstitial lung disease).Nivolumab was associated with a significant improvement in overall survivaland a favourable safety profile compared with chemotherapy in previously treated patients with advanced oesophageal squamous  carcinoma, and might represent a new standard second-line treatment option for these patients.ONO Pharmaceutical Company and Bristol-Myers Squibb.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) correlate with potent  suppressive activity and resistance to the   blocking (ICB) in tumor sites. Here, a multifunctional nanoregulator incorporating MnO particles and small molecular IPI549 is developed, which can reshape the tumor  microenvironment (TIME) to unleash the  system. The intravenously administered nanoregulator effectively accumulates in tumor sites to alleviate hypoxia via oxygen-generating reduction of MnO and to inhibit PI3Kγ on MDSCs via IPI549 release in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which results in concurrent downregulation of PD-L1 expression, polarization of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) toward pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype (tumor-suppressive), enhanced infiltration of CD4 helper T lymphocytes (Th cells), and cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes (Tc cells), and suppressed infiltration of regulatory T lymphocytes (T cells) for effective tumor immunotherapy. Furthermore, the local generation of Mn in TME allows tumor-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). More excitingly, the nanoregulator-reshaped TIME is effectively reserved due to the synergistic effect of hypoxia alleviation and MDSC PI3Kγ inhibition, leading to remarkable post-medication inhibition of tumor re-growth and metastasis in an animal study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511065>Recovery from secondary adrenal insufficiency in a patient with   inhibitor therapy induced hypophysitis.</a></h2><p>Hypophysitis is a well-recognized -related adverse event in patients treated with   inhibitors for cancer. Some anterior pituitary hormones may recover; however, secondary adrenal insufficiency is usually permanent.A 26-year old male with metastatic clear  renal  carcinoma was started on treatment with the anti-programmed  death-1 monoclonal antibody (anti-PD-1 mAb) nivolumab, followed by combined nivolumab and the anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) mAb, ipilimumab. After starting nivolumab monotherapy the patient developed thyroiditis, which resolved without treatment. Prior to commencing combined ICI therapy, a random serum cortisol drawn at 1:30 pm and was 15.0 μg/dL (414 nmol/L). Three weeks after starting combined ICI therapy he developed sudden onset of severe fatigue and 1 pm serum cortisol was .0 μg/dL (55. nmol/L), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 16 pg/mL (3.52 pmol/L). A diagnosis of hypophysitis was made, and he was immediately started on prednisone 1 mg/kg. His symptoms resolved rapidly, and he continued   inhibitor therapy. He was noted to also have low gonadotropic hormones and testosterone (nadir testosterone 81.19 ng/dL). The prednisone was tapered slowly over the next six weeks to a maintenance dose of 5 mg daily. Four months after the initial presentation his cortisol remained low, but his testosterone level had increased to 973.43 ng/dL. After five months his random serum cortisol (1 pm) increased to 11.0 μg/dL (303.6 nmol/L). The prednisone was cautiously discontinued with close monitoring. Two months off glucocorticoid replacement he remained asymptomatic with an ACTH of 24.1 pg/mL (5.3 pmol/L), and cortisol of 13.0 μg/dL (358.8 nmol/L).This case documents the unusual recovery from secondary adrenal insufficiency in a patient who developed hypophysitis from   inhibitor therapy. Repeated pituitary hormone testing every three months for the first year after the development of hypophysitis may identify more patients with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534232>Qualifying antibodies for image-based  profiling and multiplexed tissue imaging.</a></h2><p>Multiplexed tissue imaging enables precise, spatially resolved enumeration and characterization of  types and states in human resection specimens.

Overall, in the institutional cohort, objective response rate (ORR) was 30%, PFS was 7. mo, and 1-yr OS was 77%. Antibiotic users (n=31, 21%) had a lower ORR (12.9% vs 34.8%, p=0.026) and shorter PFS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]=1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-3.20, p=0.007) than antibiotic nonusers. In the trial-database cohort, antibiotic use (n=709, 17%) adversely impacted OS in patients treated with interferon (HR=1.62, 95% CI 1.13-.31, p=0.008) or with VEGF-TT and prior cytokines (HR=1.65, 95% CI 1.04-.62, p=0.033), but not patients treated with mTOR inhibitors or VEGF-TT without prior cytokines. Limitations include retrospective design, and limited details regarding concomitant medications and antibiotic indication/duration.Antibiotic use appears to reduce the efficacy of immunotherapy-based regimens in mRCC. The modulation of gut microbiota may play an important role in optimizing outcomes of patients treated with ICIs.We evaluated metastatic renal  carcinoma patients and found that those who were treated with immunotherapy had worse outcomes if they also received antibiotics at the start of treatment. This study highlights the importance of judicious antibiotic use.Copyright © 2019.

Programmed  death ligand 1(PD-L1), a member of the B7 family of molecules, plays a crucial role in tumor immunobiology. However, the prognostic significance of PD-L1 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patients remains controversial. This study aimed to inquire into the prognostic and clinicopathological significance of PD-L1 in CCA via a meta-analysis.  We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar up to April 2019, regardless of the region or language, for studies on the correlation between clinicopathology/prognosis and PD-L1 in patients with CCA. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to investigate the prognostic significance of PD-L1 expression in cholangiocarcinoma. The odds ratios (ORs) were also determined to explore the association between PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological features.  Our meta-analysis included 11 studies with 1,066 patients. The meta-analysis of these studies indicated a trend that high PD-L1 expression indicated a poor OS, but the result was not statistically significant (HR = 1.62, 95% CI [0.98-.68],  = 0.063). For DFS, although the pooled result is not statistically significant, it trends toward being significant that high PD-L1 expression indicated improved DFS (HR = 0.80, 95% CI [0.62, 1.04],  = 0.092). In subgroup analyses, the results were not consistent across the subgroups that were divided based on the publication year (before 2018: HR = 1.92, 95% CI [1.34-.75],  < 0.001; after 2018: HR = 1.42, 95% CI [0.70-.89],  = 0.335). Moreover, PD-L1 expression in TCs significantly correlated with the AJCC TNM stage of CCA (OR = 0.52, 95% CI [0.27, 0.99],  = 0.09).  Our meta-analyses revealed that PD-L1 expressed in TCs was significantly correlated with the AJCC TNM stage of CCA. Based on the included studies, we found that PD-L1 indeed expressed in both TCs and ICs in CCA patients, raising the possibility of the use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy for CCA patients. In contrast, expression of PD-L1 did not seem to be associated with patient outcome in our study. The prognostic role of PD-L1 in CCA demands further investigation.Copyright © 2019 Xu, Sun, Li, Xie, Zhou, Yang, Du, Xu and Mao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665365>  Profiles in Luminal B Breast Cancer (Alliance).</a></h2><p>Unlike estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer, ER-positive breast cancer outcome is less influenced by lymphocyte content indicating the presence of  tolerance mechanisms that may be specific to this disease subset.A supervised analysis of microarray data from the Alliance/ACOSOG Z1031 neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) trial identified upregulated genes in Luminal B breast cancers that correlated with AI-resistant tumor proliferation (Pearson's correlation r ≥ 0.4 with Ki67) (33 cases Ki67 >10% on AI) versus Luminal-B breast cancers that were more AI-sensitive (33 cases Ki67 <10% on AI).

Gene ontologies identified that the targetable - components IDO1, LAG3, and PD1 were over-represented resistance candidates (p ≤ 0.001). High IDO1 mRNA associated with poor prognosis in luminal-B disease (METABRIC, HR = 1.43, CI 1.04 - 1.98, p = 0.03).

All three vaccines used the same modified adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vector backbone and were administered at a single dose level (DL) of 5 × 10 viral particles (VP) per vector. The vaccine regimen consisting of all three vaccines was given every 3 weeks for three doses then every 8 weeks for up to 1 year. Clinical and  responses were evaluated.Ten patients enrolled on trial (DL1 = 6 with 4 in the DL1 expansion cohort). All treatment-related adverse events were temporary, self-limiting, grade 1/ and included injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms. Antigen-specific T cells to MUC1, CEA, and/or brachyury were generated in all patients. There was no evidence of antigenic competition. The administration of the vaccine regimen produced stable disease as the best clinical response.Concurrent ETBX-011, ETBX-051, and ETBX-061 can be safely administered to patients with advanced cancer. Further studies of the vaccine regimen in combination with other agents, including   blockade, are planned.Published 2019. This is a US Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

However, the effective targeted delivery of various drugs remains a challenge. We generated a peptide assembling tumor-targeted nanodelivery system based on a breast cancer homing and penetrating peptide for the codelivery of a programmed  death ligand 1 (PD-L1) small interfering RNA (siRNA) (siPD-L1) and an indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase inhibitor as a dual blockade of an  . The vector is capable of specifically accumulating in the breast cancer tumor site in a way that allows the siRNA to escape from endosomal vesicles after being endocytosed by tumor cells. The drug within these cells then acts to block tryptophan metabolism. The results showed that locally released siPD-L1 and 1-methyl-dl-tryptophan favor the survival and activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, resulting in apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Therefore, this study provides a potential approach for treating breast cancer by blocking immunological  through the assembly of micelles with functional peptides.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31445192>Novel conjugates with dual suppression of glutathione S-transferases and tryptophan-,3-dioxygenase activities for improving hepatocellular carcinoma therapy.</a></h2><p>Tryptophan-,3-dioxygenase (TDO) is an   enzyme expressed in human tumors and involved in  evasion and tumor tolerance.

Further study indicated that compound 4 could induce higher apoptotic effect than its mother compounds via a mitochondrial-dependent pathway, simultaneously more effective to inhibit TDO and GSTs protein expression.

The function of T cells usually decreased and even exhausted in severe TB such as multiple drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), which might lead to the failure of treatment in return. The mechanism of T  dysfunction in TB is still not clear. In this study we set up a mouse model of T  dysfunction by persistent  antigen stimulation and investigated the therapeutic role of interleukin  (IL-) in it. C57BL/6 mice were primed with  Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and boosted repeatedly with a combination of  fusion proteins Mtb10.4-HspX (MH) plus ESAT6-Ag85B-MPT64 -Mtb8.4-Rv2626c (LT70) or MH plus ESAT6 and CFP10 with adjuvant of N, N'-dimethyl-N, N'-dioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA) plus polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C). Following persistent antigen stimulation, the mice were treated with IL- and the therapeutic effects were analyzed. The results showed that compared with the mice that received transient antigen stimulation (boost twice), persistent antigen stimulation (boost more than 10 times) resulted in decrease of antigen specific IFN-γ and IL- production, reduction of memory CD8 T cells, over-expression of   programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1), and impaired the protective immunity against bacterial challenge.

Recent data suggest that exposure to ICI improves response to salvage chemotherapy (SCT) in advanced non-small- lung cancer. We evaluated response to chemotherapy in patients who had progressed on ICI in patients with R/M SCCHN.A retrospective study was conducted at 4 French centres. Eligibility criteria were patients who progressed after treatment with ICI for R/M SCCHN and received SCT and for whom efficacy data were available between September 2014 and January 2018.Of 232 patients treated with ICI, 82 met eligibility criteria: 84% were male. ICI was given as monotherapy in 45% of patients or as combination in 55%. SCT included taxanes (56.1%), cetuximab in combination with taxanes or platinum (50%), platinum-based regimen (36.6%). The median number of treatment lines before SCT was  (range 1-6). The objective response rate (ORR) to SCT was 30%. Three patients (4%) presented complete response and 22 patients (27%) had partial response. Median progression-free survival was 3.6 months and median overall survival was 7.8 months. The age at SCT, initial tumour location, number of prior chemotherapy regimens, type of chemotherapy before ICI, best response to ICI, site of relapse and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group at SCT were not associated with response to SCT on univariate analysis.In R/M SCCHN, the ORR to SCT was high (30%) suggesting that exposure to ICI may increase tumour sensitivity to chemotherapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Eligibility criteria included histologically or citologically confirmed NSCLC, stage IIIB and IV, evaluable disease, sufficient organ function and at least one prior line of chemotherapy. The endpoints included Overall Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS). Safety analysis was performed with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, and -related Adverse Events (irAEs) were treated according to protocol treatment guidelines. Tumour response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. Data was analysed using SPSS, version 21.0 (IBM Statistics).From June 2015 to December 2016, a total of 229 patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled at 30 Portuguese centres. Clinical data were collected up to the end of July 2018. The baseline median age was 64 years (range 37-83) and the majority of patients were males (70.3%) and former/current smokers (69.4%). Patients with non-squamous histology predominated (88.1%), and 67.6% of the patients had received  or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Out of 229 patients, data was available for 219 patients (3 patients did not start treatment, while data was unavailable in 7 patients); of the 219 patients, 15.5% were not evaluated for radiological tumour assessment, 1.4% had complete response (CR), 21% partial response (PR), 31% stable disease (SD) and 31.1% progressive disease (PD). Thus, the ORR was 22.4% and DCR was 53.4% in this population. At the time of survival analysis the median PFS was 4.91 months (95% CI, 3.89-6.11) and median OS was 13.21 months (95% CI, 9.89-16.53). The safety profile was in line with clinical trial data.Efficacy and safety results observed in this retrospective analysis were consistent with observations reported in clinical trials and from other centres.Copyright © 2019 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia.

Nivolumab, an   inhibitor directed against programmed death-1, has been approved for non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) in pretreated patients. Although it is generally well-tolerated, immunotherapy may be complicated by a wide range of -mediated adverse events. We describe the case of an uncommon skin toxicity arising as alopecia universalis induced by nivolumab in a patient with NSCLC.A 58-year-old man received nivolumab for metastatic NSCLC after progression to 3 lines of chemotherapy. The treatment was prescribed in June 2016, and induced a rapid and significant disease response. Nivolumab was well-tolerated until May 2017, when partial alopecia at hair and eyelashes appeared. In the next months, alopecia became complete and extended to the whole body surface. The dermatologic picture was compatible with alopecia areata. A topical steroid therapy was attempted, without benefit. The patient refused systemic treatments and is still undergoing nivolumab without new toxicities and with persistent disease response.This case suggests that alopecia areata may be a rare -related adverse event of   agents. Its late onset in our patient is uncommon and unexpected, underlining that the risk of nivolumab-induced toxicity is not limited to the beginning of treatment. Despite its rarity, alopecia areata should be considered in the range of adverse events potentially induced by   inhibitors even in the long term. Potential association between toxicity and efficacy of immunotherapy in NSCLC warrants further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497363>The killing effect of novel bi-specific Trop2/PD-L1 CAR-T  targeted gastric cancer.</a></h2><p>Due to their high heterogeneity and complex tumor microenvironment, the treatment of solid tumors by CAR-T  technology is limited. This study developed bi-specific Trop2/PD-L1 specific third-generation CAR-T cells by lentiviral infection. The specific killing ability of the bi-specific CAR-T cells against Trop2 and PD-L1 expressed on the gastric cancer  line by CCK-8 assay, was confirmed . The killing ability of bi-specific Trop2/PD-L1 CAR-T cells was higher than that of mono-specific CAR-T cells (Trop2 CAR-T and PD-L1 CAR-T) and the independent control group (CD19-CAR-T and CIK). The bi-specific Trop2/PD-L1 CAR-T cells produced IFN-γ and IL- in response to the overexpression of Trop2 and PD-L1 in gastric cancer cells through ELASA assay. The levels of cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-) released by bi-specific Trop2/PD-L1 CAR-T cells were the highest among all other types of CAR-T cells and the independent control group. To further demonstrate the ability of bi-specific Trop2/PD-L1 CAR-T cells , this study testified to the anti-tumor effect of several types of CAR-T cells through a xenograft model bearing human gastric tumors. The results indicated that bi-specific Trop2/PD-L1 CAR-T cells can significantly reduce the tumor growth through intratumoral injection, with a higher inhibition effect than Trop2 specific CAR-T cells and the independent control group (CD19-CAR-T and untreated group). These results suggest that novel bi-specific Trop2/PD-L1 CAR-T cells are able to target Trop2/PD-L1 and  blockade, and reveal the killing effect on gastric cancer, therefore improving the killing effect of CAR-T cells in solid tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483464>Association of Germline Variants in Natural Killer Cells With Tumor  Microenvironment Subtypes, Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes, Immunotherapy Response, Clinical Outcomes, and Cancer Risk.</a></h2><p>Only a small fraction of patients with cancer receiving   therapy (ICT) respond, which is associated with tumor  microenvironment (TIME) subtypes and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).To examine whether germline variants of natural killer (NK) cells, a key component of the  system, are associated with TIME subtypes, the abundance of TILs, response to ICT, clinical outcomes, and cancer risk.This genetic association study explored TIME subtypes and examined the association of the germline genomic information of patients with cancer with TIME subtypes, abundance of TILs, response to ICT, prognosis, and cancer risk. Clinical information, tumor RNA sequencing, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) data of paired normal samples of patients with 13 common cancers (n = 5883) were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas.

Data collection and analysis took place in March 2017.Associations between the number of germline defective genes in NK cells and survival time and the abundance of TILs.Based on tumor RNA sequencing data, tumors were stratified into TIME-rich, TIME-intermediate, and TIME-poor subtypes. Tumors of TIME-rich subtype had more TILs (TIL-NK cells in TIME-rich head and neck squamous  carcinoma [HNSC] tumors: t = 4.85; 95% CI of the difference, 0.01-0.03; P = .19 × 10-6) compared with TIME-intermediate HNSC tumors (t = 3.70; 95% CI of the difference, 0.01-0.03; P < .001), better prognosis (patients with HNSC: hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.41-1.02; P = .054) compared with TIME-intermediate and TIME-poor subtypes, and better ICT response (patients with melanoma: odds ratio [OR], 4.45; 95% CI, 0.99-27.08; P = .04). Patients with TIME-rich tumors had significantly fewer inherited defective genes in NK cells than patients with TIME-intermediate and TIME-poor tumors (patients with HNSC: OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.26-1.07; P = .005). Similarly, patients with cancer had significantly more inherited defective genes in NK cells than individuals with no cancer (patients with HNSC: OR, 19.09; 95% CI, 4.30-315.96; P = 6.21 × 10-4). Among 11 of 13 common cancers, the number of heritable defective genes in NK cells was significantly negatively associated with survival (patients with HNSC: hazard ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.18-.66; P = .005), abundance of TILs (patients with HNSC: R = -0.25; 95% CI, -0.65-.17; P = 0.02), and response to ICT (patients with melanoma: OR, 4.45; 95% CI, 0.99-27.08; P = .04).These results suggest that individuals who have more inherited defective genes in NK cells had a higher risk of developing cancer and that these inherited defects were associated with TIME subtypes, recruitment of TILs, ICT response, and clinical outcomes. The findings have implications for identifying individuals at risk for developing cancer of many types based on germline variants of NK cells and for improving existing ICT and chimeric antigen receptor-T  therapy by adoptive transfer of healthy NK cells to patients with TIME-intermediate and TIME-poor tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451090>The Prognostic Landscape of Tumor-Infiltrating  Cells and   in Glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>Tumor-infiltrating  cells are part of a complex microenvironment and associated with improved clinical outcomes in a broad range of tumor types.

Tumors lacking central memory CD4 T cells or natural killer cells were associated with better prognosis in glioblastoma, as verified by immunohistochemical analysis. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis for a total of 71 key   molecules revealed that the expression level of inducible T  costimulators, tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 14, and UL16 binding protein 1 were negatively correlated with the clinical outcome of patients with glioblastoma. In addition, there was a significant difference between nontumor and glioblastoma samples of several   modulators based on the expression level of their corresponding gene.

In the adjuvant setting, only one in five patients may benefit from ICI, so a biomarker is needed to select those that may or may not benefit. Here, we test a new 4-gene multiplex immunotherapy panel with research use only (RUO) prototype mRNA expression profile on the GeneXpert closed system using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for association with clinical benefit after treatment with ICI therapy in metastatic melanoma patients.Pretreatment formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or ipilimumab plus nivolumab) between 2011 and 17 were selected from the Yale Pathology archives. FFPE sections were macrodissected to enrich for tumor for quantitative assessment of CD274 (PD-L1), PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2), CD8A, and IRF1 by RT-qPCR multiplex mRNA panel. Multiplex panel transcript levels were correlated with clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease [SD]); disease outcomes (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]); and protein levels assessed by quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF).Transcript levels were significantly higher in responders (CR/PR/SD) than in nonresponders (PD) for CD8A (p = 0.0001) and IRF1 (p = 0.0019). PFS was strongly associated with high CD274 (p = 0.0046), PDCD1LG2 (p = 0.0039), CD8A (p = 0.0002), and IRF1 (p = 0.0030) mRNA expression. Similar associations were observed for OS with high CD274 (p = 0.0004), CD8A (p = 0.0030), and IRF1 (p = 0.0096) mRNA expression. Multivariate analyses revealed significant PFS and OS associations with immunotherapy panel markers independent of baseline variables. Exploratory analyses revealed a novel significant association of high combined CD274 & PDCD1LG2 (L1/L2) transcript expression with PFS (p < 0.0001) and OS (p = 0.0011), which remained significant at a multivariate level for both PFS (HR = 0.31) and OS (HR = 0.39).Individual immunotherapy panel markers CD274, PDCD1LG2, CD8A, IRF1 and a combined L1/L2 mRNA levels show promising associations with melanoma immunotherapy outcome. The turnaround time of the test ( h) and easy standardization of the platform makes this an attractive approach for further study in the search for predictive biomarkers for ICI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461379>Progression of Disease Within 24 Months in Follicular Lymphoma Is Associated With Reduced Intratumoral  Infiltration.</a></h2><p>Understanding the immunobiology of the 15% to 30% of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) who experience progression of disease within 24 months (POD24) remains a priority. Solid tumors with low levels of intratumoral  infiltration have inferior outcomes. It is unknown whether a similar relationship exists between POD24 in FL.Digital gene expression using a custom code set-five  effector, six  , one macrophage molecules-was applied to a discovery cohort of patients with early- and advanced-stage FL (n = 132). T- receptor repertoire analysis, flow cytometry, multispectral immunofluorescence, and next-generation sequencing were performed. The  infiltration profile was validated in two independent cohorts of patients with advanced-stage FL requiring systemic treatment (n = 138, rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone; n = 45, rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), with the latter selected to permit comparison of patients experiencing a POD24 event with those having no progression at 5 years or more. molecules showed distinct clustering, characterized by either high or low expression regardless of categorization as an  effector,  , or macrophage molecule. Low programmed death-ligand  (PD-L2) was the most sensitive/specific marker to segregate patients with adverse outcomes; therefore, PD-L2 expression was chosen to distinguish  infiltration (ie, high PD-L2) FL biopsies from  infiltration (ie, low PD-L2) tumors.  infiltration tissues were highly infiltrated with macrophages and expanded populations of T- clones. Of note, the  infiltration subset of patients with FL was enriched for POD24 events (odds ratio [OR], 4.32; c-statistic, 0.81;  = .001), validated in the independent cohorts (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone: OR, .95; c-statistic, 0.75;  = .011; and rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone: OR, 7.09; c-statistic, 0.88;  = .011). Mutations were equally proportioned across tissues, which indicated that degree of  infiltration is capturing aspects of FL biology distinct from its mutational profile.Assessment of -infiltration by PD-L2 expression is a promising tool with which to help identify patients who are at risk for POD24.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662794>Prognostic value of PD-L1 expression for surgically treated localized renal  carcinoma: implications for risk stratification and adjuvant therapies.</a></h2><p>We aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of programmed-death receptor ligand (PD-L1) in a multinational cohort of patients with localized renal  carcinoma (RCC).Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks of 1017 patients from the Latin American Renal Cancer Group were analyzed. Tissue microarrays were immunostained for PD-L1 using a commercially available monoclonal antibody. Expression of PD-L1 in ⩾5% tumor cells was considered positive. PD-1 expression in  cells was also assessed. All cases were reviewed twice based on antibody expression and compared with a positive control. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to identify predictors of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).A total of 738 cases with complete follow up met criteria. Median age was 57 [interquartile range (IQR): 49-64] years, and median follow up was 34 (IQR: 15-62.9) months. Median tumor size was 5 cm (IQR: 3.0-7.5 cm). Approximately 8.% and 7.6% of tumors were PD-L1 and programmed -death 1 (PD-1) positive, respectively. PD-L1 and PD-1 positivity were significantly associated with higher tumor stage (both  < 0.001), and presence of tumor necrosis and lymphovascular multivariable analyses; PD-L1 positivity was found as a predictor of worse RFS [hazard ratio (HR) = .08,  = 0.05] and OS (HR = .61,  = 0.02).PD-L1 positivity was significantly associated with worse outcomes for patients with localized RCC at intermediate follow up. This marker may help stratify patients for stricter surveillance after surgical treatment and provide a basis for -inhibitor therapy in the adjuvant setting.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466589>Updates on Merkel  Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Merkel  carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but aggressive skin cancer associated with the Merkel  Polyomavirus.

The presence of liver metastases has been implicated as a poor prognostic factor in patients with metastatic cancer. We investigated the association between sites of metastatic disease and clinical outcomes in patients receiving IO.We conducted a retrospective review of 90 patients treated on IO-based phase 1 clinical trials at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University between 2009 and 2017. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were measured from the first dose of IO to date of death or hospice referral and clinical or radiographic progression, respectively. Clinical benefit (CB) was defined as a best response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD). Univariate analysis (UVA) and Multivariate analysis (MVA) were carried out using Cox proportional hazard model or logistic regression model. Covariates included age, whether IO is indicated for the patient's histology, ECOG performance status, Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) risk group, number of metastatic sites, and histology.The median age was 63 years and 53% of patients were men. The most common histologies were melanoma (33%) and gastrointestinal cancers (22%). Most patients (73.3%) had more than one site of distant metastasis. Sites of metastasis collected were lymph node (n = 58), liver (n = 40), lung (n = 37), bone (n = 24), and brain (n = 8). Most patients (80.7%) were RMH good risk. Most patients (n = 62) had received + prior lines of systemic treatment before receiving IO on trial; 27 patients (30.0%) received prior ICB. Liver metastases were associated with significantly shorter OS (HR: 0.38, CI: 0.17-0.84, p = 0.017). Patients with liver metastasis also trended towards having shorter PFS (HR: 0.70, CI: 0.41-1.19, p = 0.188). The median OS was substantially longer for patients without liver metastases (21.9 vs. 8.1 months, p = 0.0048).Liver metastases may be a poor prognostic factor in patients receiving IO on phase 1 clinical trials. The presence of liver metastases may warrant consideration in updated prognostic models if these findings are validated in a larger prospective cohort.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564188>Programmed death-ligand 1 and survival in colorectal cancers: A meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a programmed death 1 (PD-1) ligand that plays a pivotal role in the inhibition of the T--mediated  response.

In this study, we sought to clarify this by presenting a meta-analysis of relevant studies.Databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE were systematically searched for studies concerning the expression of PD-L1 and survival in colorectal cancer. The reported hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of overall survival, disease-free survival, and recurrence-free survival in the included studies were analyzed by fixed effects/random effects models.Fifteen studies involving 3078 patients with colorectal cancer were included in our meta-analysis. Overexpression of PD-L1 was found to be associated with poor overall survival (HR 1.83; 95% CI 1.21, .79;  = 0.005) and poor recurrence-free survival (HR .78; 95% CI 1.43, 5.42;  = 0.003). However, no correlation was found between PD-L1 overexpression and poor disease-free survival (HR 1.23; 95% CI 0.83, 1.82;  = 0.305). Overexpression of PD-L1 indicating poor survival held true across different geographical areas, sample sizes, analysis types, sources of HRs, and  types.Overexpression of PD-L1 is associated with worse prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer and can guide physicians in the application of PD-1/PD-L1  -targeted therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519605>Previous   Inhibitor Treatment to Increase the Efficacy of Docetaxel and Ramucirumab Combination Chemotherapy.</a></h2><p>For   inhibitor (ICI)-pretreated patients, docetaxel and ramucirumab (DOC+RAM) combination therapy may be more effective compared to patients not receiving ICI treatment.From June 2013 to July 2018, 39 patients with advanced/recurrent non-small  lung cancer underwent DOC+RAM therapy. We analyzed the efficacy and safety of DOC+RAM therapy based on the presence (pre-ICI+) or absence (pre-ICI-) of ICI pretreatment history.Of the 39 patients treated with DOC+RAM, we identified 18 (46%) pre-ICI+ patients. Overall response rates for DOC+RAM concerning pre-ICI+ and pre-ICI- patients were 38.9% vs. 19.0%, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.7 vs. .3 months [hazard ratio(HR)=0.36; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.16-0.80]. Adverse events such as fever, myalgia, arthritis, pleural effusion, and pneumonitis tended to be increased in pre-ICI+ patients.Despite increased toxicity concerns, DOC+RAM therapy in pre-ICI+ patients showed a trend for tumor regression improvement and statistically significant prolongation of PFS.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

However, its in-house assessment in routine clinical practice is currently challenging and validation is urgently needed. We have analyzed sixty NSCLC and thirty-six melanoma patients with ICI treatment, using the FoundationOne test (FO) in addition to in-house testing using the Oncomine TML (OTML) panel and evaluated the durable clinical benefit (DCB), defined by >6 months without progressive disease. Comparison of TMB values obtained by both tests demonstrated a high correlation in NSCLC ( = 0.73) and melanoma ( = 0.94). The association of TMB with DCB was comparable between OTML (area-under the curve (AUC) = 0.67) and FO (AUC = 0.71) in NSCLC. Median TMB was higher in the DCB cohort and progression-free survival (PFS) was prolonged in patients with high TMB (OTML HR = 0.35; FO HR = 0.45). In contrast, we detected no differences in PFS and median TMB in our melanoma cohort. Combining TMB with PD-L1 and CD8-expression by immunohistochemistry improved the predictive value. We conclude that in our cohort both approaches are equally able to assess TMB and to predict DCB in NSCLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518912>Targeted sequencing of plasma -free DNA to predict response to PD1 inhibitors in advanced non-small  lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Tumor mutational burden is an emerging biomarker of response to   inhibitors (ICI), whose clinical adoption is challenging. We hypothesized that targeting limited but relevant genetic alterations in plasma -free DNA along with early monitoring may non-invasively predict response to ICI in advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC).Plasma samples from patients with progressive NSCLC collected before ICI initiation and at 1 month were profiled from responders (R: PFS > 6 months) and non-responders (NR: progressive disease at first evaluation) using amplicon sequencing of hotspots and coding regions from 36 genes. The molecular profile of ctDNA, and its early kinetics were analyzed.97 patients were analyzed, of which 86 (39 R, 47 NR) were evaluable. Alterations in ctDNA were detectable in 67/86 baseline samples (78%). The detection of a targetable oncogenic driver was associated with a  months PFS. The presence of a PTEN or STK11 mutation was correlated with early progression (HR 8.9, p = 0.09 for PTEN, HR 4.7, p = 0.003 for STK11), while transversion mutations (Tv) in KRAS and TP53 predicted better outcomes (HR 0.36, p = 0.011 for TP53 Tv; HR 0.46, p = 0.11 for KRAS Tv). Patients with a low " score" (driver and/or PTEN or STK11 mutation and/or without KRAS or TP53 Tv) derived poor outcomes (median PFS  months), compared with patients with a high  score (no driver, no PTEN or STK11 and with KRAS or TP53 Tv (median PFS 14 months, p = 0.0001, HR .96). Early changes in the ctDNA allele fraction (AF) of 65 specimens were correlated with clinical outcomes (14 months PFS if AF decreases vs.  months if AF increases, p < 0.0001).Targeted sequencing of plasma ctDNA and monitoring its early variations can predict response to ICI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Patients with cancer are at increased risk of complications and hospitalizations from influenza; therefore, it is recommended that they receive inactivated influenza vaccination. However, efficacy and safety of inactivated influenza vaccination in patients receiving   inhibitors is uncertain. The objective of this prospective case series was to evaluate the incidence of -mediated adverse events (imAEs) following inactivated influenza vaccination in patients receiving   inhibitors. Changes in cytokine and chemokine levels were also evaluated.Patients receiving   inhibitors during the 2017-2018 influenza season were eligible for study participation. Peripheral blood samples were collected prior to administration of inactivated influenza vaccine and two post-vaccination time points. Evaluation of new or worsening imAEs occurred via patient questionnaire and review of medical records for 60 days following inactivated influenza vaccination. Baseline imAEs were evaluated from review of medical records for 60 days prior to inactivated influenza vaccination. Serum cytokines and chemokines were measured using a multiplex Luminex assay.Twenty-four patients were enrolled in this study. Seven patients experienced any grade imAE (one patient having ) within 60 days following inactivated influenza vaccination. The majority were Grades 1-, including rash ( = 3), hypothyroidism, myalgia, and colitis ( = 1 each). Two patients experienced severe imAEs (grade 3 nephritis and grade 4 diabetes). No significant changes ( > 0.05) in serum cytokine or chemokine concentrations were observed.Although small, our study suggests that inactivated influenza vaccine may be safely administered to patients receiving   inhibitors. The majority of imAEs following inactivated influenza vaccination were Grades 1- and did not require changes in   inhibitor therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528768>Ocular adverse events with   inhibitors.</a></h2><p>To quantify the risk of ocular adverse events with   inhibitors (ICIs) as reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Disproportionality analysis using data from U.S. FDA's Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) database 2003 to 2018. Data from pharmaceutical manufacturers, healthcare providers, consumers in the U.S., and post-marketing clinical trial reports from U.S. and non-U.S. studies. All cases of uveitis, dry eye syndrome, ocular myasthenia and eye inflammation with use of the following ICIs: atezolizumab, avelumab, cemiplimab, durvalumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Reported odds ratios (RORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for all drugs as a group or as individual agents.We identified 113 ocular adverse events for all ICIs of interest including uveitis, dry eye, ocular myasthenia and eye inflammation. Nivolumab had the highest number of adverse events (N = 68) associated with use of the ICI. Nivolumab had the highest association with ocular myasthenia [ROR = 22.82, 95% CI (7.18-72.50)] followed by pembrolizumab [ROR = 20.17, 95% CI (.80-145.20)]. Among all ICIs approved in North America, atezolizumab had the highest association with eye inflammation [ROR = 18.89, 95% CI (6.07-58.81)] and ipilmumab had the highest association with uveitis [ROR = 10.54, 95% CI (7.30-15.22)].The results of this disproportionality analysis suggest use of ICIs is associated with an increase risk for ocular adverse reactions.

CAFs have frequent opportunities to interact with  cells infiltrating the tumor stroma, but the process remains to be determined. In this study, we focused on   mechanism. We also examined the induction of programmed  death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on CAFs by  , and the clinical significance of PD-L1-expressed CAFs in non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC).CAFs were isolated from human NSCLC tissues, and PD-L1 expression levels in CAFs were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and flow-cytometry. Following immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 in surgically resected pN0M0 NSCLC (n = 125, including 88 invasive adenocarcinomas and 37 squamous  carcinomas), the correlation of PD-L1-positive CAFs with clinicopathological features was investigated.PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression on CAFs was upregulated by exogenously supplemented interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and downregulated through the depletion of IFN-γ. PD-L1 expression on CAFs was upregulated by co-culture with activated lymphocytes releasing IFN-γ. Immunohistochemistry revealed that PD-L1-positive CAFs were observed in 31 cases (24.8%). Postoperative relapse-free survival was significantly prolonged in patients with PD-L1-positive CAFs as compared with those with PD-L1-negative CAFs, with 5-year relapse-free probabilities of 84.5% and 66.3%, respectively (P = 0.031). Multivariate analysis revealed that PD-L1 expression on CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of longer relapse-free survival after surgery (hazard ratio: 3.225, P = 0.027).PD-L1 expression on CAFs is reversibly regulated by environmental stimuli including IFN-γ from activated lymphocytes. In the non-metastatic NSCLC, PD-L1 expression on CAFs suggests the induction of anti-tumor  responses, contributing to better prognosis after surgery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Detection of this malignancy is delayed due to the lack of symptoms in the early-stage cancer, which makes it extremely difficult to treat. Identifying effective strategies has been a challenge for improving the survival rates in pancreatic cancer patients. Resistance to chemotherapy is often developed in pancreatic cancer treatment. Although many strategies are under clinical trials to target certain markers associated with cancer, immunotherapeutic approaches are currently gaining importance. Immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer is in the limelight after preclinical research showed some promise. Immunotherapy approaches were tested along with other treatment options to enhance the treatment effect. Adoptive  transfer and   inhibitors are currently in clinical trials. The Food and Drug Administration approved pembrolizumab in a fast-tracked review for advanced pancreatic cancer patients. Pembrolizumab blocks the  protein, programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1), on T cells to boost the response of the  system against cancer cells, thereby shrinking tumors. The recent developments in immunotherapy and the early success in other cancers are encouraging to further test immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer. The combination of pembrolizumab and pelareorep, an isolate of human reovirus, is in phase II clinical study in metastatic disease. Depending on the results of current clinical trials and testing, the strategies in the pipeline are expected to increase the use of immunotherapy in the clinical testing setting. Success in immunotherapy is urgently needed to address the side-effects, treating patients with advanced disease and reducing metastasis for increasing the survival rate in pancreatic cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539077>Association of Tumor Protein p53 and Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated Comutation With Response to   Inhibitors and Mortality in Patients With Non-Small  Lung Cancer.</a></h2><p>  inhibitors (ICIs) can elicit durable antitumor responses in patients with non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC), but only 20% to 25% of patients respond to treatment. As important genes in the DNA damage response pathway, comutation in the tumor protein p53 (TP53) and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) genes may be associated with genomic instability and hypermutation. However, the prevalence of TP53 and ATM comutation and its association with response to ICIs are not fully understood.To examine the prevalence of the TP53 and ATM comutation, the potential mechanism, and its association with response to ICIs among patients with NSCLC.This multiple-cohort study included patients with NSCLC from the Geneplus Institute, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) databases and from the POPLAR and OAK randomized controlled trials. Samples in the Geneplus cohort were collected and analyzed from April 30, 2015, through February 28, 2019. Data from TCGA, the MSKCC, and the POPLAR and OAK cohorts were obtained on January 1, 2019, and analyzed from January 1 to April 10, 2019. Next-generation sequencing assays were performed on tumor samples by the Geneplus Institute. Genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data were obtained from TCGA and MSKCC databases.Comprehensive genetic profiling was performed to determine the prevalence of TP53 and ATM comutation and its association with prognosis and response to ICIs.The main outcomes were TP53 and ATM comutation frequency, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, gene set enrichment analysis, and  profile in NSCLC.Patients with NSCLC analyzed in this study included 2020 patients in the Geneplus cohort (mean [SD] age, 59.5 [10.5] years; 1168 [57.8%] men), 1031 patients in TCGA cohort (mean [SD] age, 66. [9.5] years; 579 [56.%] men), 1527 patients in the MSKCC cohort (662 [43.4%] men), 350 patients in the MSKCC cohort who were treated with ICIs (mean [SD] age, 61.4 [13.8] years; 170 [48.6%] men), and 853 patients in the POPLAR and OAK cohort (mean [SD] age, 63.0 [9.1] years; 527 [61.8%] men). Sites of TP53 and ATM comutation were found scattered throughout the genes, and no significant difference was observed in the frequency of TP53 and ATM comutation within the histologic subtypes and driver genes. In 5 independent cohorts of patients with NSCLC, TP53 and ATM comutation was associated with a significantly higher tumor mutation burden compared with the sole mutation and with no mutation (TCGA, MSKCC, Geneplus, and POPLAR and OAK cohort). Among patients treated with ICIs in the MSKCC cohort, TP53 and ATM comutation was associated with better OS than a single mutation and no mutation among patients with any cancer (median OS: TP53 and ATM comutation, not reached; TP53 mutation alone, 14.0 months; ATM mutation alone, 40.0 months; no mutation, 22.0 months; P = .001; NSCLC median OS: TP53 and ATM comutation, not reached; TP53 mutation alone, 11.0 months; ATM mutation alone, 16.0 months; no mutation, 14.0 months; P = .24). Similar results were found in the POPLAR and OAK cohort in which the disease control benefit rate, progression-free survival, and OS were all greater in patients with the TP53 and ATM comutation compared with the other 3 groups (median progression-free survival: TP53 and ATM comutation, 10.4 months; TP53 mutation, 1.6 months; ATM mutation, 3.5 months; no mutation, .8 months; P = .01; median OS: TP53 and ATM comutation, 22.1 months; TP53 mutation, 8.3 months; ATM mutation, 15.8 months; no mutation, 15.3 months; P = .002).This study's findings suggest that the TP53 and ATM comutation occurs in a subgroup of patients with NSCLC and is associated with an increased tumor mutation burden and response to ICIs. This suggests that TP53 and ATM comutation may have implications as a biomarker for guiding ICI treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552167>Dramatic Response of Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis to Nivolumab in PD-L1 Highly Expressive Non-small  Lung Cancer: A Case Report.</a></h2><p>In a patient who had been diagnosed of located squamous  lung carcinoma, pneumonectomy, and adjuvant chemotherapy were performed.

However, the clinical activity of nivolumab in non-clear  RCC (nccRCC) is unknown, as these patients were excluded from the trials.We reviewed the records of patients who received nivolumab for nccRCC and ccRCC with >20% rhabdoid with the primary endpoint to assess the objective response rate (ORR). We assessed radiographic response using RECIST, v1.1. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We also reviewed the literature to identify studies reporting on the clinical activity of   inhibitors in nccRCC, and performed a meta-analysis of proportions for ORR and disease control rate (DCR).Twelve patients (30%) had papillary histology, 11 (27.5%) had unclassified, 8 (20%) had ccRCC with rhabdoid component, 5 (12.5%) had chromophobe, 3 (7.5%) had translocation, and 1 (.5%) had mucinous tubular and spindle  carcinoma. Overall, seven patients (21.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7%-37.9%) had an objective response, including three patients (8.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9%-23.7%) who achieved a complete remission.

We performed genomic and immunohistochemical profiling of tumors from eight patients who have completed multiple rounds of neoadjuvant trastuzumabb to identify predictive biomarkers for trastuzumab-elicited tumor  responses. Immunohistochemistry showed that all tumors had an activated tumor  microenvironment positive for nuclear NF-κB/p65RelA, CD4, and CD8 T  markers, but only four out of eight tumors were positive for the PD-1   molecule, which is indicative of an exhausted  environment. Exome sequencing showed no specific driver mutations correlating with PD-1 positivity. Hierarchical clustering of the RNA sequencing data revealed two distinct groups, of which Group  represented the PD-1 positive tumors. A gene expression signature that was derived from this clustering composed of 89 genes stratified HER2+ breast cancer patients in the TCGA dataset and it was named PD-1-Associated Gene Expression Signature in HER2+ Breast Cancer (PAGES-HBC). Patients with the Group  PAGES-HBC composition had significantly more favorable survival outcomes with mortality reduced by 83% (hazard ratio 0.17; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.60;  = 0.011). Analysis of three longitudinal samples from a single patient showed that PAGES-HBC might be transiently induced by trastuzumab, independent of clonal tumor expansion over time. We conclude that PAGES-HBC could be further developed as a prognostic predictor of trastuzumab response in HER2+ breast cancer patients and be potentially used as an alternative biomarker for anti-PD-1 therapy trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672794>The Incidence, Causes, and Risk Factors of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Receiving   Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>  inhibitor use in oncology is increasing rapidly. We sought to determine the frequency, severity, cause, and predictors of AKI in a real-world population receiving  inhibitors.We included all patients who received  inhibitor therapy from May 2011 to December 2016 at Massachusetts General Hospital. Baseline serum creatinine, averaged 6 months before  inhibitor start date, was compared with all subsequent creatinine values within 12 months of starting therapy. AKI was defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria for fold changes in creatinine from baseline. Sustained AKI events lasted at least 3 days and was our primary outcome. The cause of sustained AKI was determined by chart review. Cumulative incidence and subdistribution hazard models were used to assess the relationship between baseline demographics, comorbidities, and medications, and sustained AKI and potential  inhibitor-related AKI.We included 1016 patients in the analysis. Average age was 63 (SD 13) years, 61% were men, and 91% were white. Mean baseline creatinine was 0.9 mg/dl (SD 0.4 mg/dl), and 169 (17%) had CKD (eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m) at baseline. A total of 169 patients (17%) experienced AKI, defined by an increase in creatinine at least 1.5 times the baseline within 12 months; 82 patients (8%) experienced sustained AKI and 30 patients (3%) had potential  inhibitor-related AKI. The first episode of sustained AKI occurred, on average, 106 days (SD 85) after  inhibitor initiation. Sixteen (%) patients experienced stage 3 sustained AKI and four patients required dialysis. Proton pump inhibitor use at baseline was associated with sustained AKI.AKI is common in patients receiving  inhibitor therapy. The causes of sustained AKI in this population are heterogenous and merit thorough evaluation. The role of PPI and other nephritis-inducing drugs in the development of sustained AKI needs to be better defined.Copyright © 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616560>Nivolumab-induced cholangitis in patients with non-small  lung cancer: Case series and a review of literature.</a></h2><p>  inhibitors (ICIs), including nivolumab, have exhibited substantial benefits in the treatment of several types of cancers. However, treatment with ICIs is often accompanied by -related adverse events (irAEs), and a clear understanding of the precise indications and management of irAEs is important for harnessing the full potential of these agents. While skin- or gastrointestinal-associated irAEs have been relatively well studied, there are few reports regarding nivolumab-induced cholangitis. We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with advanced or recurrent non-small  lung cancer who were treated with nivolumab between December 2015 and December 2018 at Tottori University in Japan. Among the 59 patients, we identified four patients who experienced nivolumab-induced cholangitis. Of these four patients, stable disease (SD) was observed in two patients (50%), while partial response (PR) was achieved in two patients (50%) under nivolumab treatment. Patients were treated with corticosteroid alone (n=) or in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (n=); these treatments resulted in improvements in nivolumab-induced cholangitis in three patients. In conclusion, the present retrospective study identified four cases of nivolumab-induced cholangitis. The combination of corticosteroid and MMF was effective in two cases with grade 4 nivolumab-induced cholangitis.

Blocking the interaction of PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1/ L2 is able to active T--mediated antitumor response. Monoclonal antibody-based drugs targeting PD-1 pathway have exhibited great promise in cancer therapy. Here we show that MW11-h317, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, displays high affinity for PD-1 and blocks PD-1 interactions with PD-L1/L2. MW11-h317 can effectively induce T--mediated  response and inhibit tumor growth in mouse model. Crystal structure of PD-1/MW11-h317 Fab complex reveals that both the loops and glycosylation of PD-1 are involved in recognition and binding, in which Asn58 glycosylation plays a critical role. The unique glycan epitope in PD-1 to MW11-h317 is different from the first two approved clinical PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab. These results suggest MW11-h317 as a therapeutic monoclonal antibody of PD-1 glycosylation-targeting which may become efficient alternative for cancer therapy.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598336>Druggable Molecular Targets for the Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer (BC) is still the most common cancer among women worldwide. Amongst the subtypes of BC, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by deficient expression of estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor  receptors. These patients are therefore not given the option of targeted therapy and have worse prognosis as a result. Consequently, much research has been devoted to identifying specific molecular targets that can be utilized for targeted cancer therapy, thereby limiting the progression and metastasis of this invasive tumor, and improving patient outcomes. In this review, we have focused on the molecular targets in TNBC, categorizing these into targets within the  system such as   modulators, intra-nuclear targets, intracellular targets, and  surface targets. The aim of this review is to introduce and summarize the known targets and drugs under investigation in phase II or III clinical trials, while introducing additional possible targets for future drug development.

The efficacy of radiotherapy (RT), especially combined with   inhibitors (ICIs), for this rare melanoma subtype remains unknown. We investigated the reciprocal effect of RT and ICI on mucosal melanoma patients.  We identified 23 patients with 31 tumors who were treated with RT between July 2008 and February 2017. All patients received RT for primary or metastatic gross tumor mass with a median dose of 4 Gy per fraction (range 1.8-12 Gy). Eleven patients (14 lesions) were treated with RT alone, whereas 12 (17 lesions) were administered pembrolizumab combined with RT (ICI+RT group). The local control (LC) and adverse event (AE) rates were compared between the groups. Eight patients with metastatic mucosal melanoma treated with ICI alone during the same study period were included as a comparison group.  The median follow-up period was 17.4 (range 3.7-95.) months. The target lesion control rate at 1-year was significantly higher in the ICI+RT group than in the RT-alone group or ICI-alone group (94.1% vs. 57.1% vs. 25%;  < 0.05). No abscopal effect was observed in our cohort. Treatment-related AEs were not significantly increased in the combined treatment group compared with the RT-alone group ( > 0.05). No grade ≥3 AEs occurred in the ICI+RT group.  Besides RT acting as an  adjuvant, ICI might have a radiosensitizing effect and may increase LC without severe toxicity. We have initiated a phase II study to determine the effects of RT in patients with melanoma undergoing anti-PD1 ().</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31502168>Cyclic Multiplexed-Immunofluorescence (cmIF), a Highly Multiplexed Method for Single- Analysis.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy harnesses the power of the adaptive  system and has revolutionized the field of oncotherapy, as novel therapeutic strategies have been introduced into clinical use. The development of   inhibitors has led to durable control of disease in a subset of advanced cancer patients, such as those with melanoma and non-small  lung cancer. However, predicting patient responses to therapy remains a major challenge, due to the remarkable genomic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental heterogeneity present in each tumor. Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women, where hormone receptor-positive (HR+; estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor) BC comprises the majority (>50%) and has better prognosis, while a minority (<20%) are triple negative BC (TNBC), which has an aggressive phenotype. There is a clinical need to identify predictors of late recurrence in HR+ BC and predictors of immunotherapy outcomes in advanced TNBC. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have recently been shown to predict late recurrence in HR+, counter to the findings that TILs confer good prognosis in TNBC and human epidermal growth factor receptor  positive (HER2+) subtypes. Furthermore, the spatial arrangement of TILs also appears to have prognostic value, with dense clusters of  cells predicting poor prognosis in HR+ and good prognosis in TNBC. Whether TIL clusters in different breast cancer subtypes represent the same or different landscapes of TILs is unknown and may have treatment implications for a significant portion of breast cancer patients. Current histopathological staining technology is not sufficient for characterizing the ensembles of TILs and their spatial patterns, in addition to tumor and microenvironmental heterogeneity. However, recent advances in cyclic immunofluorescence enable differentiation of the subsets based on TILs, tumor heterogeneity, and microenvironment composition between good and poor responders. A computational framework for understanding the importance of the spatial relationships between TILs and tumor cells in cancer tissues, which will allow for quantitative interpretation of cyclic immunostaining, is also under development. This chapter will explore the workflow for a newly developed cyclic multiplexed-immunofluorescence (cmIF) assay, which has been optimized for formalin-fixed. paraffin-embedded tissues and developed to process digital images for quantitative single- based spatial analysis of tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment, including   composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519206>Clinical and  profiling for cancer of unknown primary site.</a></h2><p>  inhibitors (ICIs) confer a survival benefit in many cancer types. Given that the survival outcome for cancer of unknown primary site (CUP) remains poor, we investigated the potential of CUP for immunotherapy.A total of 164 patients with CUP (favorable subset, 34 patients; unfavorable subset, 130 patients) who were treated between January 2009 and March 2017 was identified from a review of medical records at Kindai University Hospital. They included 92 patients for whom pretreatment tumor tissue was available both for determination of programmed  death-ligand 1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and for -related gene expression profiling (irGEP). The results of irGEP for CUP were compared with published data for ICI-treated solid cancers classified into progressive disease (PD) and non-PD subsets according to their best response to ICIs.The median overall survival of all CUP patients was 29.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.7-not reached) and 7.1 months (95% CI, 5.0-9.4) for favorable and unfavorable subsets, respectively. IHC and irGEP revealed that pretreatment  activity-including expression of   molecules-for CUP was similar to that for ICI-responsive malignancies (antitumor   signatures: CUP versus PD, P = 0.002-0.067; CUP versus non-PD, P = 0.591-0.999), although VEGFA expression was associated with suppression of antitumor immunity in CUP (P = 0.008, false discovery rate = 0.010). In addition, one case of CUP in the unfavorable subset that was associated with prominent PD-L1 expression on TILs and showed a durable response to nivolumab is presented.The survival outcome of CUP remains unsatisfactory. However, our clinical and  profiling of CUP has revealed a potential to benefit from immunotherapy, with ICIs thus being a potential option for CUP treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544840>Investigational Monoclonal Antibodies in the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma: A Systematic Review of Agents under Clinical Development.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy for multiple myeloma (MM) has been the focus in recent years due to its myeloma-specific  responses. We reviewed the literature on non-Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to highlight future perspectives. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov to include phase I/II clinical trials. Data from 39 studies (1906 patients) were included. Of all the agents, Isatuximab (Isa, anti-CD38) and F50067 (anti-CXCR4) were the only mAbs to produce encouraging results as monotherapy with overall response rates (ORRs) of 66.7% and 32% respectively. Isa showed activity when used in combination with lenalidomide (Len) and dexamethasone (Dex), producing a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 83%. Additionally, Isa used in combination with pomalidomide (Pom) and Dex resulted in a CBR of 73%. Indatuximab Ravtansine (anti-CD138 antibody-drug conjugate) produced an ORR of 78% and 79% when used in combination with Len-Dex and Pom-Dex, respectively.Combination therapy using mAbs such as indatuximab, pembrolizumab, lorvotuzumab, siltuximab or dacetuzumab with chemotherapy agents produced better outcomes as compared to monotherapies. Further clinical trials investigating mAbs targeting CD38 used in combination therapy are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611635>A pilot trial of pembrolizumab plus prostatic cryotherapy for men with newly diagnosed oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.</a></h2><p>Monotherapy with   inhibitors has generally been unsuccessful in men with advanced prostate cancer. Preclinical data support the notion that cryotherapy may improve -mediated and anti-tumor responses. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and feasibility of whole-prostate gland cryotherapy combined with pembrolizumab and androgen deprivation in men with oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.This single-institution, pilot trial recruited 12 patients with newly diagnosed oligometastatic prostate cancer between 2015 and 2016. Patients underwent whole-prostate cryoablation combined with short-term androgen deprivation (eight months) and pembrolizumab (6 doses). The primary clinical endpoints were the number of patients with a PSA level of <0.6 ng/mL at one year and the frequency of adverse events. Other outcome measures included progression-free survival and systemic therapy-free survival. Exploratory analyses included PD-L1 protein expression.Forty two percent (5/12) of patients had a PSAs of <0.6 ng/mL at one year though only  of these patients had recovered their testosterone at this time point. Median progression-free survival was 14 months, and median systemic therapy-free survival was 17.5 months. PD-L1 expression was not detectable by IHC in patients with evaluable tissue. All adverse events were grade ≤, and there were no apparent complications from cryotherapy.Whole-prostate cryoablation combined with short-term androgen deprivation and pembrolizumab treatment was well tolerated and no safety concerns were observed in men with oligometastatic prostate cancer. Though local disease appeared effectively treated in the majority of men, the regimen only infrequency led to sustained disease control following testosterone recovery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592989>Blood   Biomarkers in Patient With Lung Cancer Undergoing Treatment With  Blockade.</a></h2><p>Characterization of host   parameters before and during immunotherapy is expected to identify predictive biomarkers for clinical outcome. We prospectively monitored blood  cells from 35 patients with advanced non-small  lung cancer undergoing  inhibitor monotherapy. The aim was to identify parameters correlating with better/worse outcome. Peripheral blood was serially collected before each infusion at the onset and at  3 and 5 of immunotherapy. A complete leukocyte blood count, the lymphocytic subpopulations and the percentages of both HLA-DR monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) were monitored. Disease control was defined as partial/complete response and stable disease on computed tomography scan according to RECIST 1.1. The predictive value of the   parameters investigated was evaluated by patients' survival analysis. Forty percent of patients showed a clinical response, and the global median overall survival was 7.0 months (95% confidence interval: 3.5-10.5). Patients with an initial neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ≥5., and/or an amount of HLA-DR monocytes ≥11% and/or a total DC level ≤0.4% of leukocytes did rarely respond to PD-1 inhibitor therapy. Otherwise, the immunotherapy-induced decrease of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and/or HLA-DR monocytes and the increase of total DC frequencies were correlated with improved therapy response and prolonged overall survival. Blood values in the third  of immunotherapy did already reflect the effects observed. On the basis of the 3   parameters identified we created 3 different variants of scores that enable to stratify patients into groups of risk/therapy response. Our results warrant further investigation in larger prospective clinical trials for validation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671314>Real-life results from the overall population and key subgroups within the Italian cohort of nivolumab expanded access program in non-squamous non-small  lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Nivolumab was the first   inhibitor approved for previously treated advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). Before its introduction in the market, nivolumab was made available to NSCLC patients through an expanded access program (EAP). Here we present the Italian cohort of patients with non-squamous NSCLC enrolled in a worldwide nivolumab EAP, with subgroup analyses involving elderly patients, patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases and patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression.Pretreated patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC received nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every  weeks up to 24 months. Efficacy data (investigator-assessed tumour response, progression date and survival) and safety data were collected.1588 patients were treated across 153 Italian centres. Overall response rate and disease control rate were 18% and 44%, respectively; median overall survival (OS) was 11.3 months (95% CI: 10.-12.4). Elderly patients (≥70 n = 522; ≥75 n = 232) achieved outcomes similar to the global study population; patients with CNS metastases (n = 409) had an OS of 8.6 months (95% CI: 6.4-10.8), and a 1-year OS rate of 43%. Nivolumab was administered beyond progression to 276 patients (26%), 57 of whom achieved subsequent disease control; the median OS of patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression was 16. months (95% CI: 14.0-18.4), while 1-year OS rate was 62%.To date, this is the largest clinical experience with nivolumab in a real-world setting. Our data support its use in clinical practice for pretreated non-squamous NSCLC, including patients with older age or CNS metastases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the risk of -related liver dysfunction between in patients treated by programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors exclusively and chemotherapy.  A comprehensive search of multiple databases identified eligible studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exclusively and chemotherapy in patients with different solid tumors was carried out. The elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartic aminotransferase (AST) were used to evaluate liver dysfunction. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and analyzed by Review Manager 5.3 and STATA version 12.0 statistical software.  After screening and eligibility assessment, a total of 5638 patients from 12 RCTs were included in our meta-analysis. In comparison with chemotherapy, patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exclusively showed an increased incidence of all-grade ALT/AST elevations (ALT: RR, 1.52, 95% CI, 1.09-.13;  = 0.01; AST: RR, 1.96, 95% CI, 1.37-.81;  0.0002). Patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors showed the significantly higher risk of all-grade ALT/AST elevations incidence than those receiving chemotherapy (ALT: RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.05-.07;  0.03; AST: RR, 1.90, 95% CI, 1.32-.73;  = 0.0005). However, no significant difference was found between PD-L1 inhibitor and chemotherapy group. Moreover, for non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) and urothelial carcinoma (UC), patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exclusively exhibited a significant higher risk of all-grade ALT elevation incidence (NSCLC: RR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.23-3.02;  = 0.004; UC: RR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.12-10.06,  = 0.03) and all-grade AST elevation incidence (NSCLC: RR, .37; 95% CI, 1.45-3.87,  = 0.0005; UC: RR, 4.47; 95% CI, 1.30-15.38,  0.02) than chemotherapy.  The meta-analysis confirms that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exclusive pose an increased risk of -related liver dysfunction than chemotherapy. PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in NSCLC and UC increase the risk of -related liver dysfunction, but not in melanoma (MM) and head-neck squamous  carcinoma (HNSCC).Copyright © 2019 Deng, Yang, Shu, Lang and Lu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652645>Epigenetic Reprogramming for Targeting -Mutant Malignant Gliomas.</a></h2><p>Targeting the epigenome has been considered a compelling treatment modality for several cancers, including gliomas. Nearly 80% of the lower-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas harbor recurrent mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (). Mutant IDH generates high levels of -hydroxyglutarate (-HG) that inhibit various components of the epigenetic machinery, including histone and DNA demethylases. The encouraging results from current epigenetic therapies in hematological malignancies have reinvigorated the interest in solid tumors and gliomas, both preclinically and clinically. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in epigenetic therapy for lower-grade gliomas and discuss the challenges associated with current treatment options. A particular focus is placed on therapeutic mechanisms underlying favorable outcome with epigenetic-based drugs in basic and translational research of gliomas. This review also highlights emerging bridges to combination treatment with respect to epigenetic drugs. Given that epigenetic therapies, particularly DNA methylation inhibitors, increase tumor immunogenicity and antitumor  responses, appropriate drug combinations with   inhibitors may lead to improvement of treatment effectiveness of immunotherapy, ultimately leading to tumor  eradication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648184>  inhibitor-associated thyroid dysfunction: a disproportionality analysis using the WHO adverse drug reaction database VigiBase.</a></h2><p>Our study aimed to identify and characterize thyroid dysfunctions associated with immume  inhibitors (ICIs).Data were obtained from VigiBase, between January 1, 2011 to March 6, 2019.All thyroid drug-adverse events are classified by group queries according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Information component (IC) and reporting odds ratio (ROR) were considered as measures of disproportionality for the assessment of association between ICIs and thyroid dysfunctions. We used IC to identify meaningful drug-adverse events while using ROR to compare differences in the reporting of drug-adverse events caused by different ICI subgroups. Positive IC values are deemed significant.Compared with the full database, the following ICI-associated thyroid dysfunctions were over-reported: hypothyroidism (1125 reports for ICIs vs 12495 for all drugs; Information Component 4.28 [95% CI 4.18-4.35]), hyperthyroidism (926 vs 7538; 4.66 [95% CI 4.55-4.74]), thyroiditis (294 vs 1237; 5.40 [95% CI 5.21-5.54]), thyrotoxic crisis (11 vs 288; 3.55 [95% CI .61-4.20]). Hypothyroidism was over-reported for patients treated with ICI combination therapy versus those treated with ICI monotherapy (ROR 1.3 [95% CI 1.1-1.7]), and the same was observed for hyperthyroidism (ROR 1.9 [95% CI 1.5-.4]), thyroiditis (ROR 3.3 [95% CI .3-4.8]), thyrotoxic crisis (ROR 11.5 [95% CI .4-53.8]). All 11 thyrotoxic crisis cases were malignant melanoma patients, of which 7 occurred under ICI combination therapy.Thyroid dysfunction may occur after ICI therapies, and severe thyrotoxic crisis may even occurs. Raising awareness of ICI-associated thyroid dysfunction can improve the detection and treatment of these diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522865>Pathologic response and surgical outcomes in patients undergoing nephrectomy following receipt of   inhibitors for renal  carcinoma.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the pathologic response, safety, and feasibility of nephrectomy following receipt of   inhibition (ICI) for renal  carcinoma (RCC).Patients who underwent nephrectomy for RCC after exposure to nivolumab monotherapy or combination ipilimumab/nivolumab were reviewed. Primary surgical outcomes included operative time (OT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay (LOS), readmission rates, and complication rates. Pathologic response in the primary and metastatic sites constituted secondary outcomes.Eleven nephrectomies (10 radical, 1 partial) were performed in 10 patients after ICI with median postoperative follow-up 180 days. Six patients received 1 to 4 cycles of ipilimumab/nivolumab, while 5 received  to 12 infusions of nivolumab preoperatively. Five surgeries were performed laparoscopically, and 4 patients underwent concomitant thrombectomy. One patient exhibited complete response (pT0) to ICI, and 3/4 patients who underwent metastasectomy for hepatic, pulmonary, or adrenal lesions exhibited no detectable malignancy in any of the metastases resected. No patients experienced any major intraoperative complications, and all surgical margins were negative. Median OT, EBL, and LOS were 180 minutes, 100 ml, and 4 days, respectively. Four patients experienced a complication, including 3 that were addressed with interventional radiology procedures. One patient died of progressive disease >3 months after surgery, and 1 patient succumbed to pulmonary embolism complicated by sepsis. No complications or readmissions were noted in 6 patients.Nephrectomy following ICI for RCC is safe and technically feasible with favorable surgical outcomes and pathologic response. Timing of the nephrectomy relative to  dosing did not seem to impact outcome. Biopsies of lesions responding radiographically to ICI may warrant attention prior to surgical excision.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p></html>
