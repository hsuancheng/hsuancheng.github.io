<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589553> Among Pregnant Women in Urban Areas of Arusha Region, Tanzania.</a></h1><p> To establish the prevalence of  (IR) and its determinants among selected pregnant women in urban Arusha for taking preventive measures.  A cross-sectional study was conducted between March and December 2018 at Ngarenaro and Kaloleni health facilities in Arusha District involving 230 randomly selected pregnant women who were not known to have diabetes before pregnancy. Blood glucose at fasting and 2 hr after consuming 75 grams of glucose dissolved in 300 mL of water was measured using Gluco-Plus™, serum  concentrations using ELISA machine (Synergy/HTX™; BioTek), and IR was calculated using the Homeostasis Model of Assessment formula. Body fat was measured using a bioelectric impedance analyzer, mid-upper arm circumference using a regular tape, weight using SECA™, blood pressure using GT-868UF Geratherm™ machine, and height by stadiometer. Maternal characteristics were collected through face to face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science™ Version 20.  The prevalence of IR was 21% ( = 49) and significantly associated with increased body fat percentage (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-2.), family history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; AOR: 2.77, 95% CI: 1.21-6.33), hypertension (AOR: 2., 95% CI: 1.12-.6), edema (AOR: 3.01, 95% CI: 1.31-6.96), and proteinuria (AOR: 3.44, 95% CI: 1.11-10.69).  IR was higher among pregnant women with increased body fat percentage, family history of T2DM, hypertension, edema, and proteinuria. These findings call for large-scale screening to further explore risk factors to prevent gestational diabetes mellitus.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554524>EFFECT OF HIGH-FAT DIET ON PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS AND ADIPOSE TISSUE IN EARLY STAGES OF DIET-INDUCED WEIGHT GAIN.</a></h1><p>Subcutaneous adipose tissue (scAT) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) play a significant role in obesity-associated systemic low-grade inflammation. High-fat diet (HFD) is known to induce inflammatory changes in both scAT and PBMCs. However, the time course of the effect of HFD on these systems is still unknown. The aim of the current study was to determine the time course of the effect of high fat diet (HFD) on PBMCs and scAT. New Zealand white rabbits were fed HFD for  or 10 weeks (i.e., HFD- and HFD-10), or regular chow (i.e., CNT- and CNT-10). Thereafter, metabolic and inflammatory parameters of PBMCs and scAT were quantitated. HFD induced hyperfattyacidemia in HFD- and HFD-10 groups, with the development of  (IR) in HFD-10, while no changes were observed in scAT lipid metabolism and inflammatory status. HFD activated the inflammatory pathways in PBMCs of HFD- group, and induced modified autophagy in that of HFD-10. The rate of fat oxidation in PBMCs was directly associated with the expression of inflammatory markers; and tended to inversely associate with autophagosome formation markers in PBMCs. HFD affected systemic substrate metabolism, and the metabolic, inflammatory, and autophagy pathways in PBMCs in the absence of metabolic and inflammatory changes in scAT. Dietary approaches or interventions to avert HFD-induced changes in PBMCs could be essential in prevention of metabolic and inflammatory complications of obesity, and promote healthier living.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641146>Sustained Improvements in Glucose Metabolism Late After Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery in Patients with and Without Preoperative Diabetes.</a></h1><p>To describe glucose metabolism in the late, weight stable phase after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) in patients with and without preoperative type 2 diabetes we invited 55 RYGB-operated persons from two existing cohorts to participate in a late follow-up study. 44 (24 with normal glucose tolerance (NGT)/20 with type 2 diabetes (T2D) before surgery) accepted the invitation (median follow-up 2.7 [Range 2.2-.0 years]). Subjects were examined during an oral glucose stimulus and results compared to preoperative and 1-year (1 y) post RYGB results. Glucose tolerance, , beta-cell function and incretin hormone secretion were evaluated. 1 y weight loss was maintained late after surgery. Glycemic control, , beta-cell function and GLP-1 remained improved late after surgery in both groups. In NGT subjects, nadir glucose decreased 1 y after RYGB, but did not change further. In T2D patients, relative change in weight from 1 y to late after RYGB correlated with relative change in fasting glucose and HbA1c, whereas relative changes in glucose-stimulated  release correlated inversely with relative changes in postprandial glucose excursions. In NGT subjects, relative changes in postprandial nadir glucose correlated with changes in beta-cell glucose sensitivity. Thus, effects of RYGB on weight and glucose metabolism are maintained late after surgery in patients with and without preoperative T2D. Weight loss and improved beta-cell function both contribute to maintenance of long-term glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, and increased glucose stimulated  secretion may contribute to postprandial hypoglycemia in NGT subjects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571983>The relationship between pancreatic cancer and type 2 diabetes: cause and consequence.</a></h1><p>Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a devastating and lethal malignant disease and it is well known that there is a complex bidirectional relationship between PC and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In order to more deeply summarize the relationship between them, this article summarizes the epidemiological data on the relationship between PC and T2DM in the past  years, and further explains the mechanism of interaction between them. Meanwhile, it also summed up the effects of drug therapy for T2DM on PC and the impact of T2DM on surgical resection of PC. Epidemiological studies clearly indicate that the risk of PC is increased in patients with T2DM. But increasing epidemiological data points out that PC also acts as a cause of T2DM and new-onset T2DM is sign and consequence of PC. , hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and chronic inflammation are the mechanisms of T2DM-Associated PC. Metformin decreases the risk of PC, while  therapy increases the risk of PC. Besides, studies have shown that T2DM decreases the survival in patients with PC resection.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587813>Peripartum Management of Gestational Diabetes Using a Digital Health Care Service: A Pilot, Randomized Controlled Study.</a></h1><p>The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing, and multifaceted interventions are effective in the management of GDM. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a model for the management of GDM with the use of mobile health care.This was a prospective, randomized controlled pilot study. A total of 21 patients who were diagnosed with GDM during 24-28 weeks of gestation were randomly divided into a conventional management (CM) group (n = 10) and a mobile management (MM) group (n = 11). The CM group received conventional GDM management and could freely use the mobile health care application. The MM group received mobile health care services, including tailored mobile coaching. After delivery, obstetric outcomes were collected, and 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was performed at -12 weeks postpartum.Baseline characteristics, including glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA), were not significantly different between the 2 groups. No statistically significant differences were found in rates between the 2 groups for (1) neonate large for gestational age and (2) cesarean section at the time of delivery. No significant difference was found in HbA between the 2 groups after delivery. However, postpartum homeostatic model assessment , body mass index, weight, and percentage of body fat were significantly lower in the MM group.The MM group had no significant difference in glycemic index compared with the CM group. However, the MM group had effective weight control and improved  after delivery. This study indicated that mobile health care services could be an efficient GDM management tool.

Mice ( = 10) were fed with HFD for 16 weeks to induce obesity and hepatosteatosis and then divided into two groups: HFD + vehicle group injected with the vehicle solution (saline) and HFD + compound C group injected with compound C in saline ( mg/kg i.p., once a day) for 4 weeks. Liver histology was observed. The expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism and proinflammation in liver tissue were examined. NLRP3 inflammasome expression in liver tissue was detected by the western blot assay. HepG2 cells were pretreated with compound C and/or AICAR for 1 h and then treated with palmitic acid (PA) for 3 h. The cells were collected, and mRNA levels were determined.There was a significant reduction in body-weight gain and daily food intake in the HFD + compound C group compared with the HFD + vehicle group ( < 0.05). The glucose tolerance test (GTT) and  tolerance test (ITT) showed that compound C alleviated . Histology analysis showed a significant reduction of hepatic steatosis by compound C. Compound C also significantly decreased fatty acid synthesis genes, while increased fatty acid oxidation genes. Furthermore, compound C significantly reduced the expression of proinflammatory markers and NLRP3 inflammasome ( < 0.05). Compound C enhanced mRNA levels of SOD1, SOD2, catalase, GPx1, and GPx4 and reduced the p-AMPK/AMPK ratio, which were stimulated by palmitic acid (PA). The effect was enhanced by AICAR.Our data suggest that compound C is a potent NAFLD suppressor and an attractive therapeutic target for hepatic steatosis and related metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631099>Empagliflozin's Ameliorating Effect on Plasma Triglycerides: Association with Endothelial Function Recovery in Diabetic Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.</a></h1><p>So far, the mechanisms behind the cardiovascular benefits of sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have not been fully clarified.In order to evaluate the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on systemic hemodynamics, glucose metabolism, lipid profile, and endothelial function, 50 diabetic patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD) were included in this analysis and were given empagliflozin 10 mg/d. Cookie meal testing (carbohydrates: 75 g, fats: 28. g), endothelial function testing using flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), and body composition evaluation were performed before and after six months of treatment. Changes in %FMD between the treatment periods and its association with metabolic biomarkers were evaluated.After six months of treatment, the body weight and body fat percentage decreased significantly, while the body muscle percentage increased significantly. The hemoglobin A1c level and fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels were significantly decreased with treatment. Postprandial  secretion was also significantly suppressed and the  index was significantly decreased. Furthermore, the fasting and postprandial triglyceride (TG) levels decreased significantly, while total ketone bodies increased significantly after the six-month treatment. While the plasma brain natriuretic peptide level was not changed, the C-reactive protein level was decreased and FMD was significantly improved after the six-month treatment. Multiple regression analysis showed that the strongest predictive factor of FMD improvement is change in the plasma TG levels.SGLT2 inhibitors improve multiple metabolic parameters. Of these, a reduction in plasma TGs was strongly associated with endothelial function recovery in diabetic patients with CAD, and this reduction may be related to the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555571>Association Between Trp64arg Polymorphism of the β3 adrenoreceptor Gene and Female Sex in Obese Turkish Children and Adolescents.</a></h1><p>The β3-adrenergic receptor () is expressed in visceral adipose tissue and has been speculated to contribute to lipolysis, energy metabolism, and regulation of the metabolic rate. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of polymorphism of the  gene with the sex of children with obesity and related pathologies. gene trp64arg genotyping was conducted in 441 children aged 6-18 years. Among these subjects, 264 were obese (103 boys; 161 girls) and 179 were of normal weight (81 boys; 98 girls). In the obese group, fasting lipids, glucose and  levels, and blood pressure were measured. Metabolic syndrome (MS) was defined according to the modified World Health Organization criteria adapted for children.The frequency of trp64arg genotype was similar in obese and normal weight children. In obese children, serum lipid, glucose, and  levels; homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) scores; and MS were not different between arg allele carriers (trp64arg) and noncarriers (trp64trp). In 264 obese children, genetic analysis results revealed that the arg allele carriers were significantly higher in girls than in boys (=0.001). In the normal weight group, no statistically significant difference was found between genotypes of boys and girls (=0.771).Trp64arg polymorphism of the  gene was not associated with obesity and MS in Turkish children and adolescents. Although no relationships were observed between the genotypes and lipids, glucose/ levels, or HOMA-IR, the presence of trp64arg variant was frequent in obese girls, which can lead to weight gain as well as difficulty in losing weight in women.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482956>The relationships between hemoglobin and , glucose effectiveness, and first- and second-phase  secretion in adult Chinese.</a></h1><p>We denote the four major factors related to the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) as "diabetes factor" (DF); increased  (IR); decreased glucose effectiveness (GE); and the first-and-second-phase of  secretion (FPIS, SPIS). The level of hemoglobin (Hb) was found to be related to IR and FPIS, but no-known studies focused on its role in relation to SPIS and GE. In this study, we aim to evaluate the relationships between Hb and all four DFs in the same individual.We randomly enrolled 24,407 men and 24,889 women between 30 and 59 years old. IR, FPIS, SPIS and GE were measured according to equations published in our previous studies. To compare the slopes between Hb and the four DFs with different units, we converted their units to percent of change per unit of increased Hb.Age, HDL-cholesterol and GE were higher in women; BMI, blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, TG, Hb, FPIS, SPIS and IR were higher in men. After they were converted into percentage, the closeness of their relationships to Hb, from the highest to the lowest, were GE, IR, FPIS and SPIS for women and IR, GE, FPIS and SPIS for men. GE was the only one negatively related to Hb.Our data showed that IR, FPIS and SPIS were both positively and, GE negatively, related to the Hb in adult Chinese. For women, GE had the closest association with Hb; for men, it was IR. Both phases of  secretion had relatively weaker relationships than IR and GE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546914>An Early, Universal Mediterranean Diet-Based Intervention in Pregnancy Reduces Cardiovascular Risk Factors in the "Fourth Trimester".</a></h1><p>An early antenatal dietary intervention could play an important role in the prevention of metabolic diseases postpartum. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether an early, specific dietary intervention reduces women's cardiovascular risk in the "fourth trimester". This prospective cohort study compares 1675 women from the standard-care group (ScG/n = 676), who received standard-care dietary guidelines, with the intervention group (IG/n = 999), who received Mediterranean diet (MedDiet)-based dietary guidelines, supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and nuts. Cardiovascular risk was determined by the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and  syndrome (IrS) (HOMA-IR 3.) at 12-14 weeks postpartum. MetS was less frequent in the IG (11.3 vs. 19.3%,  < 0.05). The intervention was associated with a reduction in the relative risk of having MetS: 0.74 (95% CI, 0.60-0.90), but not in the risk of IrS. When analyzing the presence of having one or more components of the MetS, the IG had significantly higher rates of having 0 components and lower rates of having ≥1 (-trend = 0.029). An early MedDiet-based nutritional intervention in pregnancy is associated with reductions in postpartum rates of MetS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599392>Acanthosis Nigricans in the Knuckles of Infants: A Novel Clinical Marker of High Metabolic Risk.</a></h1><p>Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is an early clinical sign of  (IR) primarily in adults. The prevalence and association of AN and IR in infants, however, remains uncertain. We aimed to describe the prevalence of AN and its association with IR in a group of Latin-American infants.We studied a random sample of 227 healthy infants between 9 and 24 months of age. After a complete clinical history was obtained and a physical examination was performed, fasting plasma glucose and serum  were measured. Three blinded evaluators assessed AN in each patient. Infants with AN were categorized as cases. The HOMA-IR index cutoffs of ≥ 90th and ≥ 95th percentiles were considered IR.There were 49 infants with AN (21.6%) (cases) and 178 without AN (78.4%) (controls). Cases had a significantly higher mean serum , fasting plasma glucose, and HOMA-IR levels of 3.67 ± 2.56 µU/ml vs. 2.42 ± 1.45 µU/ml, P = 0.005; 84.2 ± 12.6 mg/dL vs. 77 ± SD 9.9 mg/dL, P ≤ 0.001; HOMA-IR 0.77 ± 0.54 vs. 0.46 ± 0.28, P ≤ 0.001, respectively. More cases than controls presented HOMA-IR levels ≥ 95th percentile (cases 18.4%; controls 0.%, P ≤ 0.001) and ≥ 90th percentile (cases 32.7%; controls 1.6%, P ≤ 0.001). AN in the knuckles had a high sensitivity and a negative predictive value (NPV) for detecting patients with HOMA-IR levels above the 95th percentile (sensitivity 90%; NPV 99.4%) and above the 90th percentile (sensitivity 84.2%; NPV 98.3%).AN in the knuckles is a prevalent, non-invasive, costless, and reliable screening clinical tool that can be used for early detection of infants with IR and a high metabolic risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675433>Simultaneous angiotensin receptor blockade and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation ameliorate albuminuria in obese -resistant rats.</a></h1><p> increases renal oxidant production by up-regulating NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression contributing to oxidative damage and ultimately albuminuria. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor signaling may reverse this effect. However, whether angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation improve oxidative damage and albuminuria through different mechanisms is not known. Using  resistant Otsuka Long Evan Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, we tested the hypothesis that simultaneous blockade of AT1 and activation of GLP-1r additively decrease oxidative damage and urinary albumin excretion (U V) in the following groups: (1) untreated, lean LETO (n=7), (2) untreated, obese OLETF (n=9), (3) OLETF + angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; 10 mg olmesartan /kg/d; n=9), (4) OLETF + GLP-1 mimetic (EXE; 10 ug exenatide/kg/d; n=7), and () OLETF + ARB + exenatide (Combo; n=6). Mean kidney Nox4 protein expression and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels were 30% and 46% greater, respectively, in OLETF compared to LETO. Conversely, Nox4 protein expression and NT were reduced to LETO levels in ARB and EXE, and Combo reduced Nox4, NT, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal levels by 21%, 27%, and 27%, respectively. At baseline, U V was nearly double in OLETF compared to LETO, and increased to nearly 10-fold greater levels by the end of the study. While ARB (45%) and EXE (55%) individually reduced U V, the combination completely ameliorated the albuminuria. Collectively, these data suggest that AT1 blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation reduce renal oxidative damage similarly during , while targeting both signaling pathways provides added benefit in restoring and/or further ameliorating albuminuria in a model of diet-induced obesity.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572482>Effect of  N1115 and fructooligosaccharides in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing health concern worldwide. Administration of probiotics and prebiotics has been proposed as a convenient and effective treatment. Our study aims to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of  N1115 (N1115) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) by examining the histopathogenesis and underlying molecular events of NAFLD.An NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding C57BL/6 mice with a high-fat diet (HFD). N1115, FOS and synbiotics were administered for 16 weeks.N1115, FOS and synbiotics alleviated HFD-induced hepatic steato-sis and release of tumor necrosis factor-α, and slowed the progression of cirrhosis. Compared to the HFD group, these dietary supplements reduced serum total triglyceride and cholesterol, and appeared to decrease the fasting blood glucose and . Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests, homeostatic model assessment of  and real-time PCR showed that the regimens could overcome . These findings were associated with the transcriptional repression of inflammatory factors such as lipopolysaccharides, Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-κB. Lastly, N1115, FOS, and synbiotics improved the intestinal barrier functions and histologic integrity. This was accompanied by the restoration of the p38 MAPK pathway and in-creased expression of the tight junction components occludin-1 and claudin-1.N1115, FOS and synbiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Our data support the translation of these agents into clinical evaluation in human subjects with NAFLD and/or associated risk factors.Copyright: © 2019 Termedia & Banach.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517568>-Sitosterol Shows Potential to Protect Against the Development of High-Fructose Diet-Induced Metabolic Dysfunction in Female Rats.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a combination of risk factors that include , obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. The consumption of high-fructose diets contributes to the development of MetS. -sitosterol a naturally occurring phytosterol possesses antiobesogenic and antidiabetic effects. This study evaluated the potential protective effect of -sitosterol against the development of metabolic dysfunction in growing female rats fed a high-fructose diet, mimicking children fed obesogenic diets. Thirty-five 21-day-old female Sprague Dawley rat pups were randomly allocated to and administered the following treatments: group 1-standard rat chow (SRC) + plain drinking water (PW) + plain gelatine cube (PC); group 2-SRC + 20% w/w fructose solution (FS) as drinking fluid + PC; group 3-SRC + FS + 100 mg/kg fenofibrate in gelatine cubes; group 4-SRC + FS + 20 mg/kg -sitosterol gelatine cube (Bst); and group -SRC + PW + Bst. Following 12 weeks of feeding, the rats were fasted overnight, weighed, and then euthanized. Plasma cholesterol, , glucose, triglyceride, and adiponectin concentrations were determined. Visceral fat was dissected out and weighed. The high-fructose diet increased ( < .05) visceral adiposity and plasma triglyceride concentration but decreased ( < .05) plasma adiponectin concentration. -sitosterol prevented the high-fructose diet-induced visceral obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypoadiponectinemia. -sitosterol alone increased plasma adiponectin concentration and reduced plasma  concentration and homeostatic model assessment index.

Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by . Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between colorectal adenoma and grip strength that can predict muscle reduction in the elderly.This study included 262 participants aged ≥65 years who underwent medical examination between June 2015 and August 2018. The control group comprised participants with normal findings or hyperplasia and other benign lesions, except adenoma on colonoscopy, whereas the adenoma group consisted of participants with more than one adenoma. Grip strength was alternately measured twice for each hand using a hydraulic dynamometer.The grip strength was statistically lower in the adenoma group than in the control group among women (=0.042). For both sexes, grip strength was significantly lower in participants with ≥ adenomas than in those with < adenomas (=0.021, =0.007). Similarly, men with large adenomas (≥7 mm) exhibited significantly lower grip strength than did those with small adenomas (<7 mm) (=0.004). Even after correction for age, BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, exercise, , hypertension, and diabetes, the negative correlation between grip strength and number of adenomas among men and women remained (=0.034, =0.019).A significant relationship between hand grip strength and number of colorectal adenomas was noted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542635>Social anxiety symptoms moderate the link between obesity and metabolic function.</a></h1><p>Obesity is a well-known risk factor for elevated inflammation and . Social anxiety may moderate this relationship, such that individuals who areboth obese and socially anxious may have an even greater risk for elevated inflammation and  than those who are obese but not socially anxious; the combination of obesity and social anxiety is markedly stressful.The current paper reports secondary analyses from the Biomarker wave of the Mid-Life in the United States (MIDUS) study (N = 1255), a publicly available dataset of American adults. Participants completed a standard scale measuring social anxiety symptoms and had their waist circumference, height, and weight measured by a staff member. They also provided a fasting blood sample that was assayed for CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR, glucose, and .The interaction between obesity and social anxiety symptoms was significant. People with a larger waist circumference and more social anxiety symptoms had greater inflammation and  relative to those with a larger waist circumference but less social anxiety symptoms. These results were similar for both measures of inflammation and were robust across both the unadjusted and adjusted models. The results were also largely replicated in models using body mass index (BMI) rather than waist circumference as the measure of obesity.The current findings build on existing work about the health risks of obesity, extending it in an important new direction by demonstrating that these health risks are stronger among those who are also socially anxious. In fact, the magnitude of the relationship between obesity and metabolic function is 1. times stronger among those with more social anxiety symptoms. Thus, knowing whether a person is obese only provides one piece of the puzzle; knowing information about both obesity and social anxiety symptoms is critical for understanding who is most at risk for obesity-related health problems. Thus, a critical next step is for intervention scientists to examine health programs tailored to people who are both obese and socially anxious.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and  responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, , and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every 2 weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by 2.3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient. Compared to baseline,  decreased by 18%, but the change in glucose was not clinically significant. Other blood safety markers were within their reference ranges, and there were no adverse events.  and  mRNA expression was reduced by inhibitors of PPAR and PPAR, but there was no effect of PKA or PKG inhibition. We conclude that naringenin supplementation is safe in humans, reduces body weight and , and increases metabolic rate by PPAR and PPAR activation. The effects of naringenin on energy expenditure and  sensitivity warrant investigation in a randomized controlled clinical trial.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496048>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and aerobic exercise synergistically protect against liver injury in ovariectomized rats.</a></h1><p>Menopause increases the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We investigated the effect of incretin and/ or exercise on the hepatic fat accumulation in ovariectomized rats. Rats were divided into five groups: Group 1: Control rats, Group 2: Ovariectomized rats, Group 3: Ovariectomized rats + Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPPi) (30 mg/kg/day, orally), Group 4: Ovariectomized rats + swimming, and Group : Ovariectomized rats + swimming + DPPi. After 6 weeks, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glucose, , HOMA IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for ), FFA (free fatty acids), Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF α), IL6, IL1B levels were measured in blood. The livers were collected for Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) examination and evaluation of hepatic gene expression of SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein1c), PPAR α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha), ACC 1 (acetyl-CoA carboxylase), LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3), SIRT (sirtuin), hepatic triglycerides, IL6, IL10, caspase 3 and AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase). A significant increase in ALT level and area of liver tissue defects with a significant increase in glucose HOMA IR, serum FFA, IL6, IL1B, TNF α, liver TGs (triglycerides), inflammation, apoptosis, SREBP1c, ACC1 were found in ovariectomized rats as compared to control group with a significant decrease in PPAR α, LC3, AMPK and SIRT1. DPPi treated rats with and without exercise showed a significant improvement in ALT and area of liver tissue defects, inflammation and apoptosis and serum IL6, IL1B, TNF α, FFA, liver LC3, SIRT1, AMPK, TGs, PPAR α, ACC1 and SREBP1c as compared to the ovariectomized group. Findings from the study confirm the derangement of fat metabolism in the ovariectomized rats and showed that incretin-based therapy and exercise synergistically improved liver fat metabolism, achieved significant beneficial metabolic effects and offer full protection against NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

Though effective in reducing psychoses, acute olanzapine treatment causes rapid increases in blood glucose that are believed to be mediated by increases in liver glucose output, skeletal muscle , and beta cell dysfunction. Further, the acute lipidemic response to olanzapine has been largely unexplored. While females have been reported to be more susceptible to olanzapine-induced weight gain, there is little known about the impact of sex on the acute response to SGAs. The purpose of this study was to determine if the acute effects of SGAs on glucose and lipid metabolism display a sexually dimorphic response in C57BL/6 J mice and examine potential mechanisms mediating this effect. Age matched male and female C57BL/6 J mice were treated with olanzapine ( mg/ kg, IP) or vehicle control and blood glucose was measured at baseline, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min post-treatment and tissues and serum harvested. These experiments were repeated, and mice underwent an  (0. IU/kg) or pyruvate tolerance test (2 g/kg) following 60 min of olanzapine treatment. Females were protected against olanzapine-induced increases in blood glucose and pyruvate intolerance compared to male mice, and this occurred despite the development of severe . In male mice olanzapine increased the glucagon: ratio whereas in females this ratio was reduced. When challenged with exogenous glucagon (1 mg/kg IP), females were less responsive than males. Male and female mice displayed similar increases in whole body fatty acid oxidation, serum fatty acids and liver triglyceride accumulation. Our findings provide evidence that while there are no apparent sex differences in the lipid metabolism response to olanzapine, that females are protected from acute olanzapine-induced excursions in blood glucose. This is likely due in part to reductions in the glucagon: ratio and glucagon responsiveness which could impact olanzapine induced increases in liver glucose production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Our aim was to study whether a three-meal diet (3Mdiet) with a carbohydrate-rich breakfast may upregulate clock gene expression and, as a result, allow dose reduction of , leading to weight loss and better glycemic control compared with an isocaloric six-meal diet (6Mdiet).Twenty-eight volunteers with diabetes (BMI 32.4 ± .2 kg/m and HbA 8.1 ± 1.1% [64. ± 11.9 mmol/mol]) were randomly assigned to 3Mdiet or 6Mdiet. Body weight, glycemic control, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), appetite, and clock gene expression were assessed at baseline, after 2 weeks, and after 12 weeks.3Mdiet, but not 6Mdiet, led to a significant weight loss (-.4 ± 0.9 kg) ( < 0.01) and decreased HbA (-12 mmol/mol, -1.2%) ( < 0.0001) after 12 weeks. Fasting glucose and daily and nocturnal glucose levels were significantly lower on the 3Mdiet. CGM showed a significant decrease in the time spent in hyperglycemia only on the 3Mdiet. Total daily  dose was significantly reduced by 26 ± 7 units only on the 3Mdiet. There was a significant decrease in the hunger and cravings only in the 3Mdiet group. Clock genes exhibited oscillation, increased expression, and higher amplitude on the 3Mdiet compared with the 6Mdiet.A 3Mdiet, in contrast to an isocaloric 6Mdiet, leads to weight loss, significant reduction in HbA, appetite, and overall glycemia, with a decrease in daily . Upregulation of clock genes seen in this diet intervention could contribute to the improved glucose metabolism.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637401>Frailty and the Metabolic Syndrome - Results of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II).</a></h1><p>Frailty and the metabolic Syndrome (MetS) are frequently found in old subjects and have been associated with increased risk of functional decline and dependency. Moreover, central characteristics of the MetS like inflammation, obesity and  have been associated with the frailty syndrome. However, the relationship between MetS and frailty has not yet been studied in detail. Aim of the current analysis within the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) was to explore associations between MetS and frailty taking important co-variables such as nutrition (total energy intake, dietary vitamin D intake), physical activity and vitamin D-status into account.Complete cross-sectional data of 1,486 old participants (50.2% women, 68.7 (65.8-71.3) years) of BASE-II were analyzed. MetS was defined following the joint interim statement of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; American Heart Association; World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society; and International Association for the Study of Obesity in 2009. Frailty was defined according to the Fried criteria. Limitations in physical performance were assessed via questionnaire, muscle mass was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and grip strength using a Smedley dynamometer. Adjusted regression models were calculated to assess the association between MetS and Frailty.MetS was prevalent in 37.6% of the study population and 31.9% were frail or prefrail according to the here calculated frailty index. In adjusted models the odds of being frail/prefrail were increased about 50% with presence of the MetS (OR1.; 95% CI 1.2,1.9; p= 0.002). Moreover the odds of being prefrail/frail were significantly increased with low HDL-C (OR: 1. (95%CI: 1.0-2.3); p = 0.037); and elevated waist circumference (OR: 1.65 (95%CI: 1.1-2.3); p = 0.008).The current analysis supports an association between MetS and frailty. There are various metabolic, immune and endocrine alterations in MetS that also play a role in mechanisms underlying the frailty syndrome. To what extent cytokine alterations, inflammatory processes, vitamin D supply and hormonal changes in age and in special metabolic states as MetS influence the development of frailty should be subject of further research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545359>Weight Change and Development of Subclinical Carotid Atherosclerosis Among Metabolically Healthy Adults: A Cohort Study.</a></h1><p>The benefit of weight loss for reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in metabolically healthy obese people is unknown.We evaluated the association between weight change and incident subclinical carotid atherosclerosis (SCA) in metabolically healthy but overweight or obese subjects.Cohort study of 3,117 metabolically healthy overweight or obese adults who did not have any metabolic syndrome components or  at baseline. SCA was assessed using carotid artery ultrasonography. The study outcome was the development of incident SCA among participants free of the disease at baseline.During 12,248 person-years of follow-up (median 3.42 years), 747 participants developed SCA. The proportion of participants with no reduction or increased weight, reduction in weight 0.1-4.9%, and reduction in weight ≥% during follow-up were 47.0, 44.4, and 8.6%, respectively. The fully-adjusted HRs for incident SCA in participants with a reduction in weight of 0.1-4.9% and ≥% compared to those with no reduction or increased weight were 0.84 (95% CI 0.72-0.98) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.50-0.87), respectively.In a large cohort study of metabolically healthy but overweight or obese adult men and women, weight reduction was associated with a lower incidence of SCA. Our findings suggest that metabolically healthy overweight or obese subjects may benefit from weight reduction in terms of CVD risk.© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about the mechanism through which physical activity impacts cancer survivors' cognition.The objective of this secondary analysis examined physical and psychological function potentially linking physical activity with changes in cognition among breast cancer survivors in a randomized controlled trial where the exercise arm had greater improvements in cognition than the control arm.A total of 87 sedentary breast cancer survivors were randomized to a 12-week physical activity intervention (n=43) or control condition (n=44). Objectively measured processing speed (National Institutes of Health Toolbox Oral Symbol Digit), self-reported cognition (patient-reported outcomes measurement information system [PROMIS] cognitive abilities), PROMIS measures of physical and psychological function (depression, anxiety, fatigue, and physical functioning), and plasma biomarkers (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, homeostatic model assessment 2 of , and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were collected at baseline and 12 weeks. Linear mixed-effects models tested intervention effects on changes in physical and psychological function variables and biomarkers. Bootstrapping was used to assess mediation. Exploratory analyses examined self-reported cognitive abilities and processing speed as mediators of the intervention effect on physical functioning.Participants in the exercise arm had significantly greater improvements in physical functioning (beta=1.23; 95% CI 2.42 to 0.03; P=.049) and reductions in anxiety (beta=-1.50; 95% CI -0.07 to -2.94; P=.04) than those in the control arm. Anxiety significantly mediated the intervention effect on cognitive abilities (bootstrap 95% CI -1.96 to -0.06), whereas physical functioning did not (bootstrap 95% CI -1.12 to 0.10). Neither anxiety (bootstrap 95% CI -1.18 to 0.74) nor physical functioning (bootstrap 95% CI -2.34 to 0.15) mediated the intervention effect on processing speed. Of the biomarkers, only CRP had greater changes in the exercise arm than the control arm (beta=.253; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.57; P=.09), but CRP was not associated with cognition; therefore, none of the biomarker measures mediated the intervention effect on cognition. Neither cognitive abilities (bootstrap 95% CI -0.06 to 0.68) nor processing speed (bootstrap 95% CI -0.15 to 0.63) mediated the intervention effect on physical function.Physical activity interventions may improve self-reported cognition by decreasing anxiety. If supported by larger studies, reducing anxiety may be an important target for improving self-reported cognition among cancer survivors.ClinicalTrials.gov ; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/.©Sheri J J Hartman, Lauren S Weiner, Sandahl H Nelson, Loki Natarajan, Ruth E Patterson, Barton W Palmer, Barbara A Parker, Dorothy D Sears.

Obesity, low-grade chronic inflammatory status, and  (IR) often coexist in PCOS. The Mediterranean diet (MD) is an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern, which is rich in complex carbohydrates and fiber, and high in monounsaturated fat. There is a close association among obesity, low-grade chronic inflammation, IR, and hormonal derangements in PCOS. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the adherence to MD, the dietary intake, and the body composition and their association with PCOS clinical severity in a cohort of treatment-naïve women with PCOS when compared with a control group of healthy women matched for age and body mass index (BMI). In this case-controlled, cross-sectional study, we enrolled 112 patients with PCOS and 112 controls. PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) and seven-day food records were used to evaluate the degree of adherence to the MD and dietary pattern, respectively. Body composition was evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) phase-sensitive system. Testosterone levels and Ferriman-Gallwey score assessed the clinical severity of PCOS. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined with a nephelometric assay with CardioPhase high sensitivity. PCOS women showed higher testosterone levels, Ferriman-Gallwey score, fasting  and glucose levels, and Homeostatic Model Assessment (HoMA)-IR when compared with the control group ( < 0.001). In addition, we found that the PCOS women consumed less extra-virgin olive oil, legumes, fish/seafood, and nuts compared with control group. Despite no differences in energy intake between the two groups, the PCOS women consumed a lower quantity of complex carbohydrate, fiber, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and higher quantity of simple carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fatty acid (SFA), PUFA and n-6 PUFA than the control group. The PCOS women have an adverse body composition when compared with controls, with the lowest values of phase angle (PhA) and fat-free mass ( < 0.001). Additionally, after adjusting for BMI and total energy intake, testosterone levels showed significant negative correlations with PREDIMED score ( < 0.001) and consumption of protein ( = 0.005), complex carbohydrate ( < 0.001), fiber ( < 0.001), MUFA ( < 0.001), n-3 PUFA ( = 0.001), and positive associations with CRP levels, simple carbohydrate, SFA, n-6 PUFA ( < 0.001, respectively), and PUFA ( = 0.002). The cut-off for PREDIMED score ≤ 6 ( < 0.001, area under the curve (AUC) 0.848, standard error 0.036, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.768 to 0.909) could serve as a threshold for significantly increased risk of high value of testosterone levels. In conclusion, a novel direct association between the adherence to MD and the clinical severity of the disease was reported in women with PCOS. This association could support a therapeutic role of foods and nutrients of the Mediterranean dietary pattern in the PCOS pathogenesis likely involving their inflammatory status, IR, and hyperandrogenemia. In addition, we reported a different body composition that is characterized by lower PhA and fat-free mass than controls. These data suggested a role of PhA as a useful marker of the clinical severity of this syndrome and provided strong evidence regarding the strategic relevance of the nutritional assessment in the management of women with PCOS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498869>Cord Blood Metabolomics: Association With Newborn Anthropometrics and C-Peptide Across Ancestries.</a></h1><p>Newborn adiposity is associated with childhood obesity.

Several metabolites, including branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines, nonesterified fatty acids, and triglycerides were negatively associated with cord C-peptide but positively associated with birthweight and/or sum of skinfolds. 1,-Anhydroglucitol, an inverse marker of recent maternal glycemia, was significantly inversely associated with birthweight and sum of skinfolds. Network analyses revealed groups of interrelated amino acid, acylcarnitine, and fatty acid metabolites associated with all three newborn outcomes.Cord blood metabolites are associated with newborn size and cord blood C-peptide levels after adjustment for maternal body mass index and glucose during pregnancy. Negative associations of metabolites with C-peptide at birth were observed. 1,-Anhydroglucitol appears to be a marker of adiposity in newborns.

In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle . In the liver, branched-chain α-keto acids decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic . In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino acids, thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino acids in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing . However, branched-chain amino acids, as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce . A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino acids, alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino acids catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric acid, increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration, improving .

The present study was aimed at identifying metabolites that could be used as biomarkers for a better disease phenotyping. For this purpose, metabolic fingerprint using an untargeted metabolomic approach was examined in serum from 30 patients with acromegaly and 30 age-matched controls. Patients with acromegaly presented fewer branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) compared to the control group (valine: 4.75 ± 0.87 vs. .20 ± 1.06 arbitrary units (AUs),  < 0.05; isoleucine: 2.54 ± 0.41 vs. 2.80 ± 0.51 AUs;  < 0.05). BCAAs were also lower in patients with active disease compared to patients with normal levels of IGF-1 with or without medical treatment. GH, but not IGF-1, serum levels were inversely correlated with both valine and isoleucine. These findings indicate that low levels of BCAAs represent the main metabolic fingerprint of acromegaly and that GH, rather than IGF-1, might be the primary mediator.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of macronutrient supplements for infants born small on later development and metabolism.We searched OvidMedline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to April 1, 2019, and controlled-trials.com, clinicaltrials.gov, and anzctr.org.au. Randomised or quasirandomised trials were included if the intention was to increase macronutrient intake to improve growth or development of infants born small and assessed post-discharge outcomes. Co-primary outcomes were cognitive impairment and metabolic risk, evaluated in toddlers (<3 years), childhood (3 to 8 years), and adolescence (9 to 18 years). Two reviewers independently extracted data. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and data were pooled using random-effect models. Twenty-one randomised and one quasirandomised trial of variable methodological quality involving 3,680 infants were included. In toddlers born small, supplementation did not alter cognitive impairment (relative risk [RR] 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 1.49; P = 0.99), and there were no differences in cognitive scores (mean difference [MD] 0.57; 95% CI -0.71 to 1.84; P = 0.38) or motor scores (MD 1.16; 95% CI -0.32 to 2.65; P = 0.12) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. However, fewer supplemented children had motor impairment (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; P = 0.01). In subgroup analyses, supplementation improved cognitive scores in boys (MD .60; 95% CI 1.07 to 10.14; P = 0.02), but not girls born small (MD -2.04; 95% CI -7.04 to 2.95; P = 0.42), and did not alter cognitive or motor scores in the subgroup of children born SGA. In childhood, there was no difference in cognitive impairment (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.26 to 2.57; P = 0.72) or cognitive scores (MD 1.02; 95% CI -1.91 to 3.95; P = 0.50) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. There were also no differences in blood pressure, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (all P > 0.05). However, supplemented children had lower fasting glucose (mmol/L: MD -0.20; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; P = 0.005) and higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations (mmol/L: MD 0.11; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.19; P = 0.02). In subgroup analyses, there was no evidence of differences in blood pressure between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in boys or girls born small, or in SGA children. In adolescence, there was no difference between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL and HDL concentrations, fasting blood glucose, , and fasting  concentrations (all P > 0.05). Limitations include considerable unexplained heterogeneity, low to very low quality of the evidence, and limited data beyond early childhood.In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials, we found no evidence that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small altered later cognitive function, although there was some evidence that supplementation may decrease motor impairment in toddlers. Contrary to the findings from observational studies, evidence from randomised trials suggests that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small improves some metabolic outcomes in childhood.CRD42019127858.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598101>Management of Calcium Channel Blocker Toxicity in the Pediatric Patient.</a></h1><p>Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are commonly prescribed cardiovascular medications used in several disease states including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. Inadvertent exposure or intentional overdose of CCBs may result in hypotension, bradycardia, dysrhythmias, conduction disturbances, and hyperglycemia. In the most severe cases, CCB toxicity can lead to rapid cardiovascular collapse. Given the risk of significant morbidity and mortality associated with CCB toxicity, it is important that health care professionals are able to recognize and treat patients who present with a potentially toxic ingestion. Due to the paucity of literature in managing pediatric patients with severe CCB toxicity, treatment strategies for pediatric patients are mostly limited to case reports and extrapolation from expert consensus recommendations for adults. All pediatric patients with a potentially toxic CCB ingestion should be evaluated in the emergency department. Activated charcoal may be considered for asymptomatic patients presenting within an hour of ingestion. Symptomatic patients should be placed under cardiac monitoring and treatments to stabilize the patient's hemodynamics should not be delayed. Traditional first-line IV therapies include small boluses of fluids, calcium, and vasopressors. High-dose  has been proposed to independently increase inotropy and improve CCB-induced hypoinsulinemia and  that results from CCB inhibition of  release from pancreatic β-islet cells. High-dose  is recommended as first-line therapy for adults and shows promising efficacy and safety in several pediatric case reports. Intravenous lipid emulsion may be considered in patients who are refractory to first-line therapies, although the data for pediatric patients are extremely limited.Copyright Published by the Pediatric Pharmacy Advocacy Group.

Along with traditional cardiovascular risk factors and systemic inflammation, metabolic syndrome (MetS) contributes to CVD and increased mortality in patients with RA. In this study we determine the prevalence of MetS in RA patients presenting to a tertiary care centre in north India.This is a case control study involving 114 patients of RA with disease duration of ≥1 year and 114 healthy controls who are age and sex matched. Components of MetS were assessed in all the subjects and disease activity of RA was determined by DAS28-ESR. MetS was defined according to modified ATP-III criteria and consensus definition of metabolic syndrome for adult Asian Indians.Women constituted 81.6% in RA group and 80.% in control group. Mean age of subjects was 44.81±12.7 years in RA group and 43.27±12.6 years in control group. According to modified ATP-III criteria, 36 (31.6%) RA subjects and 17 (14.9%) controls had MetS (p=0.03). According to the consensus definition of metabolic syndrome for adult Asian Indian criteria, 40 (35.1%) RA subjects and 18 (15.8%) controls had MetS (P=0.01). There was no significant difference in disease activity between subjects of RA with or without MetS (p=0.276).The prevalence of MetS was higher in RA subjects compared to controls. There is no association of MetS with disease activity in our cohort.

This study assessed the trend of esophageal cancer mortality in Serbia.A population-based study analyzing esophageal cancer mortality in Serbia in the period 1991-2015 was carried out based on official data. The annual percentage of change (APC), with the 95% confidence interval (CI), was computed using the joinpoint regression analysis. The age, period and birth cohort effects on the mortality from esophageal cancer were examined using the age-period-cohort analysis.In Serbia, esophageal cancer mortality trend significantly increased from 1991 to 2015 in men (APC=+0.9%, 95%CI=0.3 to 1.4), but nonsignificantly increased in women (APC=+0.4%, 95%CI=-0.6 to 1.4). The age-specific mortality rates were increasing with age, but this trend has only been significant in men in the 50-59 years age group (APC = +1.%, 95%CI= 0.8 to 2.3). The age-period-cohort analysis suggested statistically non-significant period and cohort effects, and local drifts for both genders (p>0.05 for all).The trend of esophageal cancer mortality should be elucidated in future analytical epidemiological studies in Serbia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597344>Red Wine Consumption and Cardiovascular Health.</a></h1><p>Wine is a popular alcoholic beverage that has been consumed for hundreds of years. Benefits from moderate alcohol consumption have been widely supported by the scientific literature and, in this line, red wine intake has been related to a lesser risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Experimental studies and meta-analyses have mainly attributed this outcome to the presence in red wine of a great variety of polyphenolic compounds such as resveratrol, catechin, epicatechin, quercetin, and anthocyanin. Resveratrol is considered the most effective wine compound with respect to the prevention of CHD because of its antioxidant properties. The mechanisms responsible for its putative cardioprotective effects would include changes in lipid profiles, reduction of , and decrease in oxidative stress&nbsp; of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The aim of this review is to summarize the accumulated evidence correlating moderate red wine consumption with prevention of CHD by focusing on the different mechanisms underlying this relationship. Furthermore, the chemistry of wine as well as chemical factors that influence the composition of the bioactive components of red wine are also discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528978>Associations between body fat distribution and cardiometabolic risk factors in mixed-ancestry South African women and men.</a></h1><p>To investigate the relationship between body fat distribution and cardiometabolic risk in mixed-ancestry South African (SA) men and women, and to explore the effect of menopausal status on these relationships in women.In a cross-sectional study, 207 mixed-ancestry SA women and 46 men underwent measurement of body composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, blood pressure, oral glucose tolerance, lipid profile and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein determination. The associations between different body fat compartments and associated cardiometabolic risk factors were explored.Men had less percentage fat mass ( %FM) [26.% (25-75th percentiles: 19.9-32.) vs 44.0%(39.8-48.6), p ≤ 0.001], but more central and less peripheral fat (both p <0.001) than women. Post-menopausal women had greater %FM, waist and visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and less gynoid %FM than pre-menopausal women (all p ≤ 0.004). After adjusting for age and gender, VAT accounted for the greatest variance in  (R = 0.27), while trunk %FM and leg %FM accounted for the greatest variance in triglyceride (R = 0.13) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (R = 0.14). The association between fat mass and regional subcutaneous adipose tissue and cardiometabolic risk factors differed by gender and menopausal status.Central fat was the most significant correlate of cardiometabolic risk and lower body fat was associated with reduced risk.

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of orally administered Diazoxide Choline Controlled-Release Tablets (DCCR) in subjects with PWS.This was a single-center, Phase II study and included a 10-week Open-Label Treatment Period during which subjects were dose escalated, followed by a 4-week Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Treatment Period.Five female and eight male overweight or obese, adolescent and adult subjects with genetically-confirmed PWS with an average age of 15.±2.9 years were enrolled in the study. There was a statistically significant reduction in hyperphagia at the end of the Open-Label Treatment Period (-4.32, n = 11, p = 0.006). The onset of effect on hyperphagia was rapid and greater reductions in hyperphagia were seen in subjects with moderate to severe Baseline hyperphagia (-.50, n = 6, p = 0.03), in subjects treated with the highest dose (-6.25, n = 4, p = 0.08), and in subjects with moderate to severe Baseline hyperphagia treated with the highest dose (-7.83, n = 3, p = 0.09). DCCR treatment resulted in a reduction in the number of subjects displaying aggressive behaviors (-57.1%, n = 10, p = 0.01), clinically-relevant reductions in fat mass (-1.58 kg, n = 11, p = 0.02) and increases in lean body mass (2.26 kg, n = 11, p = 0.003).

How long-term dietary BCAAs impact late-life health and lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that when dietary BCAAs are varied against a fixed, isocaloric macronutrient background, long-term exposure to high BCAA diets leads to hyperphagia, obesity and reduced lifespan. These effects are not due to elevated BCAA  or hepatic mTOR activation, but rather due to a shift in the relative quantity of dietary BCAAs and other AAs, notably tryptophan and threonine. Increasing the ratio of BCAAs to these AAs resulted in hyperphagia and is associated with central serotonin depletion. Preventing hyperphagia by calorie restriction or pair-feeding averts the health costs of a high BCAA diet. Our data highlight a role for amino acid quality in energy balance and show that health costs of chronic high BCAA intakes need not be due to intrinsic toxicity but, rather, a consequence of hyperphagia driven by AA imbalance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518138>111In and 225Ac-labeled cixutumumab for imaging and alpha particle radiotherapy of IGF-1R positive triple negative breast cancer.</a></h1><p> growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) is overexpressed in many cancers of epithelial origin where it confers enhance proliferation and  to therapies targeted at other receptors. Anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies have not demonstrated significant improvements in patient outcomes in clinical trials. Humanized monoclonal antibody cixutumumab (IMC-A12) binds to IGF-1R with low nM affinity. In this study cixutumumab was conjugated with p-SCN-Bn-DOTA and radiolabeled with 111In or 225Ac for imaging or radiotherapy using a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) model SUM149PT. The antibody conjugate showed low nM affinity to IGF-1R which was not affected by conjugation and radiolabeling procedures. Cixutumumab immunoconjugates was effectively internalized in SUM149PT and was cytotoxic to the cells with an EC50 of 225Ac-cixutumumab (0.02 nM) that was almost 5000-fold less than unlabeled cixutumumab (95.2 nM). MicroSPECT imaging of SUM149PT xenograft showed the highest tumor uptake occurred at 48 h post injection and was 9.9 ± 0. % injected activity per gram (%IA/cc).

In this study, we aimed to calculate the likelihood of having ≥1 MetS component in normoweight young adults using two different metabolic health criteria. We recruited 1182 normoweight young adults from the Taiwan Survey on the Prevalence of Hypertension, Hyperglycemia, and Hyperlipidemia and the National Health Interview Survey (aged 16-45 years, 39% male, body mass index = 18.-22.99, all without MetS) and followed them for  years. Metabolic health criteria were derived from the Harmonized criteria (unhealthy if showing abnormality in one or two MetS components) and the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG-i; unhealthy if TyG-i was in the >75th percentile). Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimations for having ≥1 MetS component and for having each MetS component in  years were assessed using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. We observed a significantly increased likelihood of the presence of ≥1 MetS component in the unhealthy group by using the Harmonized criteria and TyG-i (adjusted OR (aOR); 95%CI: 2.67; 2.04-3.49 and 2.1; 1.57-2.82, respectively).

However, its effect on the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between nut consumption and NAFLD risk.We conducted a retrospective case-control study including 534 patients diagnosed with NAFLD and 534 controls matched by sex and age (± years) from the Affiliated Nanping First Hospital of Fujian Medical University in China.Information on dietary intake was collected using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and nut consumption was calculated. Nut consumption was categorised using quartiles based on the distribution of daily nut intake of the controls. Binary logistic regression models were used to estimate ORs and the 95% CIs for the association between nut consumption and NAFLD risk.After adjusting for potential confounding variables, nut consumption was not associated with NAFLD risk in the overall sample. When the fully adjusted model was stratified by sex, a significant inverse association was found between high nut consumption and NAFLD only among the men in the highest quartile (OR=0.43; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.71;   0.01). The inverse association of nut consumption with NAFLD risk in men remained significant after controlling for other known or suspected risk factors for NAFLD.Diets with a higher intake of nuts may be associated with a decreased risk of NAFLD, particularly in men.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In the present study, we hypothesized that the increased milk production associated with rbIL-8 treatment is a consequence of increased postpartum dry matter intake (DMI) and orchestrated homeorhetic changes that prioritize milk production. Cows were enrolled into 1 of 3 treatment groups: those assigned to the control group (CTR; n = 70) received an intrauterine (IU) administration of 500 mL of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) solution and 1 mL of DPBS solution intravenously (IV; jugular vein), those assigned to the rbIL-8 IV group (rbIL8-IV, n = 70) received an IV injection of 167 μg of rbIL-8 and 500 mL of DPBS solution IU, and cows assigned to the rbIL-8 IU group (rbIL8-IU, n = 70) received an IU administration with 1,195 μg of rbIL-8 diluted in 499. mL of DPBS solution and 1 mL of DPBS solution IV.

Blood samples were collected daily from calving to 7 DIM and weekly until 28 DIM.  was evaluated using an intravenous glucose tolerance test and intravenous  challenge test (IVICT) in a subgroup of cows (n = 20/treatment) at 10 and 11 DIM, respectively. Additionally, liver biopsy samples were taken at 14 DIM from the same subgroup of cows to measure triglyceride levels and cell proliferation and apoptosis. Cows treated with rbIL8-IU produced more milk (CTR = 36.9 ± 1.; rbIL8-IU = 38. ± 1.; rbIL8-IV = 36.6 ± 1. kg/d), energy-corrected milk (CTR = 42.9 ± 0.9; rbIL8-IU = 46.1 ± 0.8; rbIL8-IV = 43.7 ± 0.9 kg/d), and fat-corrected milk (CTR = 44.3 ± 0.9; rbIL8-IU = 47.8 ± 0.9; rbIL8-IV = 45.2 ± 0.9 kg/d) yields when compared with CTR cows, and no differences were observed between rbIL8-IV and CTR cows. The administration of rbIL8-IU significantly increased DMI compared with CTR (CTR = 18.8 ± 0.3; rbIL8-IU = 19.9 ± 0.3; rbIL8-IV = 19.3 ± 0.3 kg/d). Recombinant bIL-8 treatment did not affect glucose, , or fatty acids (i.e., IVICT only) concentrations or their area under the curve in response to an intravenous glucose tolerance test and IVICT when compared with CTR. Moreover, rbIL-8 treatment administered IU or IV increased liver triglyceride levels. Additionally, cows treated with rbIL8-IU tended to have lower odds of developing hyperketonemia (odds ratio = 0.46, 95% confidence interval: 0.19 to 1.10), lower odds of clinical ketosis and displaced abomasum combined (odds ratio = 0.17, 95% confidence interval: 0.03 to 0.89), and lower odds of diseases combined (odds ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.21 to 0.86) when compared with CTR. We conclude that the administration of rbIL8-IU increases DMI, milk production, fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk while improving overall health during the postpartum period. This study supports the use of rbIL-8 administered IU shortly after calving to improve health and production responses in lactating cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

From April 2015 to October 2017, 15,492 consecutive patients with diabetes diagnosed within 1 year and aged ≥30 years were recruited from 46 tertiary care hospitals in 24 cities across China. Glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody was assayed centrally and clinical data were collected locally. Classic type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were defined using the criteria of American Diabetes Association, Immunology of Diabetes Society and World Health Organization. MetS was defined using Chinese Diabetes Society's criteria. Logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) of determinants of MetS.  The overall prevalence of MetS was 66.%, with the highest prevalence in T2DM (68.1%), followed by those in LADA (44.3%) and T1DM (34.2%) ( < 0.05 for all comparisons). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, T2DM had a 2.8-fold [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.36-3.37] MetS risk compared with LADA, whereas T1DM had significantly lower OR than LADA (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50-0.92). After further adjustment for , the OR of T2DM vs. LADA was slightly reduced but the OR of T1DM vs. LADA was greatly attenuated to non-significance (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.70-1.33). In addition to types of diabetes, age, gender, geographical residence, education attainment, alcohol consumption and HOMA2-IR were independent determinants of MetS.  MetS was highly prevalent, not only in T2DM but also in T1DM and LADA in Chinese newly diagnosed patients; higher risk of MetS in LADA than in T1DM was partially attributable to higher  in LADA.Copyright © 2019 Li, Cao, Tang, Yan, Zhou, Liu, Ji, Yang and Zhou.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664103>Association of Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone and Thyroid Hormones with Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Euthyroid Children and Adolescents Aged 10-18 Years: A Population-Based Study.</a></h1><p>Recent evidence indicates that low-normal thyroid function test results within the reference ranges may be related to increased cardiometabolic risk factors. The current study aimed to evaluate the relationship between thyroid function using thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) and cardiometabolic risk factors and the clustering of these risk factors (metabolic syndrome) in euthyroid children and adolescents. A total of 250 euthyroid children and adolescents aged 10-18 years were included using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2015. In the unadjusted correlation analyses, TSH was positively correlated with glucose (r = 0.172, P = 0.006), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (r = 0.149, P = 0.018),  (r = 0.144, P = 0.023), homeostatic model assessment for  (HOMA-IR) (r = 0.163, P = 0.010), and triglyceride (TG) (r = 0.155, P = 0.014), whereas FT4 was negatively associated with the waist circumference (WC) standard deviation score (SDS) (r = -0.134, P = 0.035), body mass index (BMI) SDS (r = -0.126, P = 0.046),  (r = -0.219, P < 0.001), and HOMA-IR (r = -0.211, P < 0.001). In the multiple linear regression analysis, TSH was positively associated with glucose (β = 1.179, P = 0.021), HbA1c (β = 0.044, P = 0.039), and TG (β = 8.158, P = 0.041) after adjustment for possible confounders. FT4 was negatively associated with serum fasting  (β = -.884, P = 0.017) and HOMA-IR (β = -1.364, P = 0.023) in the multiple linear regression analysis. Boys and girls with elevated glucose levels had a higher adjusted mean TSH level compared to those without elevated glucose levels after controlling for confounding factors in the analysis of covariance (2.16 mIU/L vs 3.88 mIU/L, P = 0.004).

A harmful cycle arises when FFA are not properly regulated by  contributing to the development of , a key indicator for T2DM, since prolonged  may lead to hyperglycemia. We introduce a hypothesis-driven dynamical model and use it to evaluate the role of FFA on  progression that is mathematically constructed within the context of individuals that have genetic predisposition to dysfunctional plasma FFA. The dynamics of the nonlinear interactions that involve glucose, , and FFA are modeled by incorporating a fixed-time delay with the corresponding delay-differential equations being studied numerically. The results of computational studies, that is, extensive simulations, are compared to the known minimal ordinary differential equations model. Parameter estimation and model validation are carried out using clinical data of patients who underwent bariatric surgery. These estimates provide a quantitative measure that is used to evaluate the regulation of lipolysis by  action measured by  sensitivity, within a metabolically heterogeneous population (non-diabetic to diabetic). Results show that key metabolic factors improve after surgery, such as the effect of  inhibition of FFA on  and glucose regulation, results that do match prior clinical studies. These findings indicate that the reduction in weight or body mass due to surgery improve  action for the regulation of glucose, FFA, and  levels. This reinforces what we know, namely, that  action is essential for regulating FFA and glucose levels and is a robust effect that can be observed not only in the long-term, but also in the short-term; thereby preventing the manifestation of T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524936>Chronotype, Social Jet Lag, and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Early Adolescence.</a></h1><p>Inadequate sleep duration and quality increase the risk of obesity. Sleep timing, while less studied, is important in adolescents because increasing evening preferences (chronotypes), early school start times, and irregular sleep schedules may cause circadian misalignment.To investigate associations of chronotype and social jet lag with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk in young adolescents.Starting in 1999, Project Viva recruited pregnant women from eastern Massachusetts. Mother-child in-person visits occurred throughout childhood. From January 23, 2012, to October 16, 2016, 804 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years completed  days or more of wrist actigraphy, questionnaires, and anthropometric measurements. A cross-sectional analysis using these data was conducted from April 31, 2018, to May 1, 2019.Chronotype, measured via a continuous scale with higher scores indicating greater evening preferences, and social jet lag, measured as the continuous difference in actigraphy sleep midpoint in hours from midnight on weekends vs weekdays, with higher values representing more delayed sleep timing on weekends.Adiposity, measured via anthropometry and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. For a subset of 479 adolescents with blood samples, cardiometabolic risk scores were computed as the mean of  sex- and cohort-specific z scores for waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, inversely scaled high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and log-transformed triglycerides and homeostatic model of .Among the 804 adolescents in the study, 418 were girls and 386 were boys, with a mean (SD) age of 13.2 (0.9) years. In multivariable models adjusted for age, puberty, season, and sociodemographics, associations of chronotype and social jet lag with adiposity varied by sex. For girls, greater evening preference was associated with a 0.58-cm (95% CI, 0.12-1.03 cm; P = .04 for interaction) higher waist circumference and 0.16 kg/m2 (95% CI, 0.01-0.31 kg/m2; P = .03 for interaction) higher fat mass index as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; each hour of social jet lag was associated with a 1.19-cm (95% CI, 0.04-2.35 cm; P = .21 for interaction) higher waist circumference and 0.45 kg/m2 (95% CI, 0.09-0.82 kg/m2; P = .01 for interaction) higher fat mass index as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Associations of social jet lag and evening chronotypes persisted for many measures of adiposity after adjustment for sleep duration and other lifestyle behaviors. By contrast, no associations were observed in boys. There were no associations with the cardiometabolic risk score for either sex, although statistical power was low for this outcome.Evening chronotypes and social jet lag were associated with greater adiposity in adolescent girls but not adolescent boys. Interventions aimed at improving sleep schedules may be useful for obesity prevention, especially in girls.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480676>Whey Protein Supplementation Compared to Collagen Increases Blood Nesfatin Concentrations and Decreases Android Fat in Overweight Women: A Randomized Double-Blind Study.</a></h1><p>Protein supplements are usually used to control body weight, however, the impact of protein quality on body fat attenuation is unknown. We investigated the effects of isocaloric isoproteic supplementation of either whey protein (WG) or hydrolysed collagen supplementation (CG) on dietary intake, adiposity and biochemical markers in overweight women.In this randomized double-blind study, 37 women, [mean ± SE, age 40.6 ± 1.7 year; BMI (kg/m) 30.9 ± 0.6], consumed sachets containing 40 g/day of concentrated whey protein (25 g total protein, 2.4 leucine, 1.0 valine, 1. isoleucine,  = 17) or 38 g/day of hydrolysed collagen (26 g total protein, 1.02 leucine, 0.91 valine, 0.53 isoleucine,  = 20) in the afternoon snack. The compliance was set at >70% of the total theoretical doses. The dietary intake was evaluated by a 6-day food record questionnaire. At the beginning and after eight weeks of follow-up, body composition was evaluated by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and lipid profile, , C-reactive protein, adiponectin, leptin and nesfastin plasma concentrations were analyzed.Supplements were isocaloric and isoproteic. There were no differences in caloric intake ( = 0.103), protein ( = 0.085), carbohydrate ( = 0.797) and lipids ( = 0.109) intakes. The branched chain amino acids (BCAA) (GC: 1.8 ± 0.1 g vs. WG: . ± 0.3 g,  < 0.001) and leucine intake (CG: 0.1 ± 0.1 g vs. WG: 2.6 ± 0.1 g,  < 0.001) were higher in WG compared to CG. BMI increased in the CG (0.2 ± 1.1 kg/m,  = 0.044) but did not change in WG. WG decreased the android fat (-0.1 ± 0.3 kg,  = 0.031) and increased nesfatin concentrations (4.9 ± 3.2 ng/mL,  = 0.014) compared to CG.Whey protein supplementation in overweight women increased nesfatin concentrations and could promote increase of resting metabolic rate as part of body composition improvement programs compared to collagen supplementation for 8 weeks.

MPA (400 mg/day) and metformin (750-2,250 mg/day) were administered to achieve complete response (CR). Metformin was administered until conception, even after MPA discontinuation.Of the total patients, 48 (76%) had a body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m² and 43 (68%) showed . Sixty-one patients (97%) achieved CR within 18 months. CR rates at 6, 8-9, and 12 months were 60%, 84%, and 90%, respectively. During a median follow-up period of 57 months (range, 13-115 months), relapse occurred in 8 of 61 patients (13.1%) who had achieved CR. Relapse-free survival (RFS) in all patients at  years was 84.8%. Upon univariate analysis, patients with BMI ≥25 kg/m² had significantly better prognoses than did those with BMI <25 kg/m² (odds ratio=0.19; 95% confidence interval=0.05-0.66; p=0.009). Overall pregnancy and live birth rates per patient were 61% (19/31) and 45% (14/31), respectively.MPA plus metformin is efficacious in terms of RFS and post treatment conception.

Few data are available in the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) era, especially in cirrhotic patients. We prospectively evaluated the long-term effect of DAAs on IR. Patients treated with DAAs between May 2015 and December 2016 in 3 tertiary care centers were recruited. Patients with diabetes were excluded. Biochemical and virological data were collected at baseline, 12/24/48-weeks (W) after the end of therapy (EOT). Presence of IR was defined by a "homeostasis model assessment index for IR" [HOMA-IR]) > 2.. Liver fibroscan was performed at baseline, at 24/48W after EOT. 138 patients were enrolled (mean age 58 years, M/F 85/53, GT1 61%, 68.8% cirrhotic). Sixty-eight (94/138) had IR. Patients with IR had significantly higher stiffness than patients without it (23±12 vs. 15±8; p <0.0001). SVR12 was achieved in 135 (98%) patients, and 124 (90%) patients reached the 48W post-EOT. At this time-point, the percentage of patients with IR significantly decreased to 49% (p=0,01). HOMA-IR was significantly lower than baseline (1.8 vs. 3; p<0.001), and this was related to a significant reduction of  level (11.7±6.3 vs 16.4±8.3). High BMI was associated with a significantly lower probability of achieving a non-IR status at 24W (p=0.05) and 48W (p=0.03). IN CONCLUSION: SVR following DAAs led to a significant reduction of IR, even in patients with cirrhosis. Nevertheless, IR can persist after the achievement of SVR, especially in patients with high BMI.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654312>Clinical, hormonal and metabolic parameters in women with PCOS with different combined oral contraceptives (containing chlormadinone acetate versus drospirenone).</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting -10% of women of reproductive age. It is characterized by chronic anovulation leading to menstrual disorders, and increased infertility. The syndrome can also manifest as hirsutism and acne.The aim of the study was to compare, over a duration of 6 months, the effects of drospirenone (DRSP) versus chlormadinone acetate (CMA) containing oral contraceptives (OCs) on clinical, hormonal, and metabolic parameters in 120 PCOS women.120 women with the diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam 2003 criteria were recruited to the study. All patients were divided to two treatment groups of OCs, containing: 3 mg DRSP/30 mcg EE (ethinylestradiol) (60 patients) and 2 mg CMA/30 mcg EE (60 patients). Clinical parameters such as hirsutismus and acne were evaluated. Metabolic parameters such as serum , glucose concentration, homeostatic model assessment of , body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also measured. Among hormonal parameters, serum estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free thyroxine were measured.The use of both DRSP- or CMA-containing OCs provided similar positive therapeutic effects with regard to clinical, metabolic, and hormonal parameters. Among clinical parameters, like hirsutismus, after 6 months of continuous OC treatment, a statistically significant improvement was observed in both groups: DRSP (p <  0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001). In addition, significant improvement was showed according to acne lesions both after DRSP (p < 0.0001) and CMA treatments (p < 0.0001). Among glucose,  levels and HOMA-IR, there were statistically significant higher levels in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.05) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.02, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001). Hormonal parameters such as LH, FSH, prolactin, testosterone and DHEA-S were statistically significant lower in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.01, p < 0,002, and p < 0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.04, p < 0.002, and p < 0.0001).Further research, however, is needed not only to define optimal duration, and to clarify the effects of treatment on long-term metabolic outcomes, but also to explore different treatment options and possible combined therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540136>Liraglutide Inhibits Hepatitis C Virus Replication Through an AMP Activated Protein Kinase Dependent Mechanism.</a></h1><p> and diabetes are both associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and the glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) receptor agonist, liraglutide, is a common therapy for diabetes. Our aim was to investigate whether liraglutide treatment can inhibit HCV replication. A cell culture-produced HCV infectious system was generated by transfection of in vitro-transcribed genomic JFH-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) into Huh-7. cells. Total RNA samples were extracted to determine the efficiency of HCV replication. The Ava5 cells were treated with liraglutide and cell viability was calculated. A Western blot analysis of the protein expression was performed. The immunoreactive blot signals were also detected. Liraglutide activated GLP-1 receptors in the HCV infectious system, and inhibited subgenomic HCV RNA replication in the HuH-7. cells. The Western blot analysis revealed both HCV protein and replicon RNA were reduced after treatment with liraglutide in a dose-dependent manner. Liraglutide decreased the cell viability of HCV RNA at an optimum concentration of 120 μg/mL, activated the ' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the phosphorylated- transducer of regulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (CAMP) response element-binding protein 2 (TORC2), thereby decreasing the cell viability of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and G6pase RNA Therefore, we conclude that liraglutide can inhibit HCV replication via an AMPK/TORC2-dependent pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667519>Short-term dietary reduction of branched-chain amino acids reduces meal-induced  secretion and modifies microbiome composition in type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled crossover trial.</a></h1><p>Epidemiological studies have shown that increased circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with  and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This may result from altered energy metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific  sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess  signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole-body and hepatic  sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived  secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05).

Among 976 identified publications, 20 randomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The initial search was extended to include five studies published between July 2016 and September 2018.Maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, cesarean section, maternal parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations, and infant gestational age, birth weight, and birth length.Mean differences, odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, only for the initial search, using separate random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome.Evidence was good or strong that maternal vitamin D supplementation significantly increased maternal (13 studies, n=18, mean difference, 14.1 ng/mL [35.2 nmol/L]; 95% CI=9.6-18.6 ng/mL [24.0-46.4 nmol/L]) and infant (nine studies, n=12; 9.7, .2, 14.2 ng/mL [24.2, 12.9, 35. nmol/L]) 25(OH)D concentrations, although heterogeneity was significant (I=95.9% and I=97.4, respectively, P<0.001). Evidence was fair that vitamin D supplementation significantly decreases maternal homeostatic model assessment- (five studies, n=7; -1.1, -1., -0.7) and increases infant birth weight (nine studies, n=11, 114.2, 63.4, 165.1 g), both had insignificant heterogeneity. A null effect of maternal supplementation on other maternal (preeclampsia, cesarean section) and infant (gestational age, birth length) outcomes was found.Results show vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy improves maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations and may play a role in maternal  and fetal growth. To further inform practice and policies on the amount of vitamin D, which supports a healthy pregnancy, high quality dose-response randomized clinical trials, which assess pregnancy-specific 25(OH)D thresholds, and appropriately powered clinical outcomes are needed.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Given that approximately 50% of pregnancies are unplanned, alcohol has the potential to affect fetal development and program chronic disease in offspring. We examined the effect of an acute but moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on glucose metabolism, lipid levels and dietary preference in adolescent and/or adult rat offspring. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received an oral gavage of ethanol (1 g kg maternal body weight, n = 9 dams) or an equivalent volume of saline (control, n = 8 dams) at embryonic days 13. and 14.. PAE resulted in a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05-0.06% 1 h post-gavage in dams. Fasting blood glucose concentration was not affected by PAE in offspring at any age, nor were blood glucose levels during a glucose tolerance test (GTT) in 6-month old offspring (P > 0.). However, there was evidence of  in PAE male offspring at 6 months of age, with significantly elevated fasting plasma  (P = 0.001), a tendency for increased first phase  secretion during the GTT and impaired glucose clearance following an  challenge (P = 0.007). This was accompanied by modest alterations in protein kinase B (AKT) signalling in adipose tissue. PAE also resulted in reduced calorie consumption by offspring compared to controls (P = 0.04). These data suggest that a relatively low-level, acute PAE programs metabolic dysfunction in offspring in a sex-specific manner.

Low circulating level of Total and High Molecular Weight adiponectin have been associated with components of the metabolic syndrome and could represent an independent risk factor with potential use as biomarker.To examine the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in scholar children and to compare the degree of association of Total and High Molecular Weight adiponectin levels with biochemical parameters related to the metabolic syndrome.The study included a population of 155 boys and girls, from 8 to 11 years old. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were evaluated according to weight and metabolic syndrome status. A correlation analysis was fitted to establish an association between adiponectin concentration and metabolic indicators.The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was of 10.3%. Impaired biochemical parameters, including Total and High Molecular Weight adiponectin, were associated with obesity. The adiponectin level was significantly lower in MS than in Non-MS subjects (4. vs. .4 μg/mL). Total- but no High Molecular Weight adiponectin concentration was negatively correlated with blood pressure, fasting , and Homeostatic Model Assessment for .In young children, the Total-adiponectin level is associated with impaired biochemical parameters and could be an excellent early predictor of metabolic complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554591>Comparison of fasted basal  with the combined glucose- test in horses and ponies with suspected  dysregulation.</a></h1><p>Fasting horses for measurement of basal serum  concentration (fasting ; FI) has been recommended to standardise testing for  dysregulation (ID), yet limited data exist comparing it to dynamic tests. This study aimed to compare FI with the combined glucose- test (CGIT) in horses suspect for ID. We hypothesised that FI would have poor sensitivity for detecting ID compared to CGIT using conventional cut-offs. Records were retrieved from CGITs performed in horses fasted for approximately 8h. Serum  and glucose concentrations were measured before and for 150min following an IV bolus of glucose followed by . Correlations between FI and CGIT values were assessed. Youden's index analysis was used to determine the optimal cut-off for FI. Logistic regression and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to determine factors affecting the results. CGITs (n=130) from 62 horses were evaluated. Compared to CGIT, sensitivity and specificity of FI for diagnosis of ID were 14.6% and 100% at a cut-off of 20μIU/mL and 63.4% and 87.2% at a cut-off of .2μIU/mL, respectively. FI was significantly correlated with  at 45min (r=0.66) and 75min (r=0.72); area under the curve for  (AUC; r=0.67); glucose at 45min (r=0.53); and AUC (r=0.50). Obesity was significantly associated with increased odds of a positive CGIT and horses with a positive CGIT were significantly older (P<0.05). In conclusion, FI correlated well with CGIT results and had adequate sensitivity and specificity at lower cut-offs, despite poor sensitivity at conventional cut-off values. Further research to derive cut-off values relevant to the fasting period is warranted.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Clinical evaluation: anthropometry and pubertal staging. Laboratory tests: total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides, paraoxonase 1, apolipoproteins A-I and B, myeloperoxidase (MPO), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), glycemia and  (to calculate HOMA-IR). In the preterm group, 19 (43.2%) were male, with mean birth weight and gestational age of 1157 ± 242 g and 30.0 ± 2.3 weeks, respectively. The preterm group showed lower concentrations of HDL-c (60.1 ± 10.1 vs. 69.0 ± 10.0 mg/dL; p < 0.001); higher concentrations of hs-CRP [0.55 mg/dL (0.30; 39.4) vs. 0.30 mg/dL (0.30; 10.80); p = 0.043], of MPO [21.1 ng/mL (.7; 120.0) vs. 8.1 ng/mL (2.6; 29.6); p < 0.001] and of MPO/HDL-c ratio [0.39 (0.09; 2.07) ng/mg vs. 0.11 (0.05; 0.58)]. The MPO/HDL-c ratio was the variable that showed the best discriminatory power between the groups (AUC = 0.878; 95% CI; 0.795-0.961). MPO concentrations in the preterm group were correlated with those of hs-CRP (r = 0.390; p = 0.009),  (r = 0.448; p = 0.002) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.462; p = 0.002).Prepubertal preterm children show high MPO concentrations and MPO/HDL-c ratio that are associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, which, in turn, may be associated with atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

IGF-I, IGFBP-3, serum calcium and phosphorus were measured at baseline. Anthropometric [body-mass index (BMI) and waist] and cardio-metabolic [systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, , homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), HDL cholesterol and triglycerides] variables were assessed at baseline and at the end of follow-up. Statistical analysis included Pearson correlations followed by multivariable linear regression analyses.Baseline IGF-I and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 molar ratio positively correlated with baseline and follow-up BMI, waist, SBP, pulse pressure, , HOMA-IR and triglycerides (r from 0.138 to 0.603; all p<0.05). The associations with SBP were stronger with increasing Ca*P (r from 0.261 to 0.625 for IGF-I; and r from 0.174 to 0.583 for IGF-I/IGFBP-3). After adjusting for confounding variables, baseline IGF-I and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 remained independently associated with both baseline and follow-up SBP in children in the highest Ca*P tertile (β from 0.245 to 0.381; p<0.01; model R2 from 0.246 to 0.566).Our results suggest that IGF-I in childhood is an independent predictor of SBP in apparently healthy children, especially in those with high Ca*P levels.© Endocrine Society 2019.

We identified abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ScAT) transcriptome profiles in relation to liver or muscle IR by means of RNA sequencing in overweight/obese participants of the DiOGenes cohort (n=368). Tissue-specific IR phenotypes were derived from a -point oral glucose tolerance test. Hepatic and muscle IR were characterized by distinct abdominal ScAT transcriptome profiles. Genes related to extracellular remodeling were upregulated in individuals with primarily hepatic IR, whilst genes related to inflammation were upregulated in individuals with primarily muscle IR. In line with this, in two independent cohorts, CODAM (n=325) and the Maastricht Study (n=685), an increased systemic low-grade inflammation profile was specifically related to muscle IR, but not to liver IR. We propose that increased ScAT inflammatory gene expression may translate into an increased systemic inflammatory profile, linking ScAT inflammation to the muscle IR phenotype. These distinct IR phenotypes may provide leads for more personalized prevention of cardiometabolic diseases.

Extended Oral Glucose Tolerance Test was performed and showed severe IR. She was then started on metformin 850 mg twice a day, and had repeated OGTT. This showed dramatic worsening of glucose tolerance (e.g. glucose 96 mg/dl versus 187 mg/dl and 68 mg/dl versus 204 mg/dl at 120 and 150 min of OGTT, respectively). This was accompanied by a massive increase of already high  concentrations (e.g. from 488.6 to > 1000 µIU/ml, and from 246.8 to > 1000 µIU/ml at 120 and 150 min of OGTT, respectively).  concentrations remained above upper assay detection limit also at 180 min of OGTT on metformin treatment (> 1000 µIU/ml versus 100.6 µIU/ml without metformin).Metformin treatment may paradoxically lead to deterioration of  and to development of glucose intolerance in SHORT syndrome. Hence, metformin treatment might be potentially harmful in these patients. Though, the precise cause of such profound and paradoxical worsening of glucose tolerance post metformin remains unknown, SHORT syndrome might prove to be an interesting model to study the mechanism(s) of metformin action.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599244>Fasting Serum Glucose Level in Male Cigarette Smoker.</a></h1><p>Cigarette smoking is a practice in which tobacco (leaf of Nicotina Tabacum) is burned and the smoke (heterogeneous aerosol) is tasted or inhaled. Smoking may be linked to  that leads to impaired glucose and lipid metabolism. Aim of the study was to assess the levels of fasting serum glucose level in healthy male cigarette smokers in order to compare this parameter with healthy non smokers. This comparative study was carried out in the Department of Physiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from July 2013 to June 2014. One hundred healthy male subjects (75 male were cigarette smokers as study group and 25 male were non smokers as control group) aged between 16 to 40 years were enrolled in this study. Fasting serum glucose was estimated by GOD-PAP Method. Data were expressed as mean±SD and statistical significance of difference among the group was calculated by unpaired students''t' test. The mean±SD fasting serum glucose (FSG) levels were higher in smoker group in comparison to the non smoker group. There were gradual increases in FSG levels in the smokers as the duration of smoking was increased and these were 4.75±0.88, .12±0.67, .29±0.47 and .58±2.05mmol/L in group I, IIA, IIB and IIC respectively.

Boosted mitochondrial metabolism might be able to protect against metabolic stress and prevent metabolic disorders. Here we show that NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDU)-FAB1, also known as mitochondrial acyl carrier protein, acts as a novel enhancer of mitochondrial metabolism and protects against obesity and . Mechanistically, NDUFAB1 coordinately enhances lipoylation and activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase mediated by the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis pathway and increases the assembly of respiratory complexes and supercomplexes. Skeletal muscle-specific ablation of NDUFAB1 causes systemic disruption of glucose homeostasis and defective  signaling, leading to growth arrest and early death within  postnatal days. In contrast, NDUFAB1 overexpression effectively protects mice against obesity and  when the animals are challenged with a high-fat diet. Our findings indicate that NDUFAB1 could be a novel mitochondrial target to prevent obesity and  by enhancing mitochondrial metabolism.-Zhang, R., Hou, T., Cheng, H., Wang, X.

Clinical evidences have demonstrated that depletion of serum Mg increases exponentially with the duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Diabetes is associated with low Mg, and hypomagnesemia is associated with , inflammation, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. In subjects at high risk of inflammation and , supplementation of Mg alone ameliorates both phenotypes, slowing the development and progression of hepatic steatosis. We analyze the relationship between serum Mg levels and the onset of T2DM in a large cohort of well-characterized adult white individuals participating in the CATAMERI study, who were reexamined after a mean follow-up of .6 ± 0.9 years. In our analysis we acquired a significant negative correlation between Mg levels, fasting glucose, and 2h-post load glucose in subjects who underwent an OGTT. Moreover, Mg levels correlated negatively with fasting  levels, and positively with the lipid profile. As for the detrimental effect of lower circulating Mg levels, our data revealed a significant reduction of T2DM risk of about 20% for each 1 mg/dL increase of circulating Mg. The present results are consistent with the theory that Mg supplementation could ameliorate  sensitivity reducing the risk to develop T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515691>Benserazide, an Inhibitor of Peripheral Kynurenine Metabolism, Attenuates Olanzapine-Induced Weight Gain, , and Dyslipidemia in C57Bl/6j Mice.</a></h1><p>Schizophrenia (Sz) patients, especially treated with atypical antipsychotics, are at high risk of the development of metabolic syndrome that increases morbidity and mortality and impairs compliance with treatment. Mechanism of the high association of metabolic syndrome with the use of atypical antipsychotics is not clear. Literature and our data suggest that chronic inflammation- or stress-induced dysregulation of the peripheral down-stream kynurenine (Kyn) metabolism, shared by both Sz and metabolic syndrome, contributes to the development of metabolic syndrome in Sz patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Correction of dysregulation of the peripheral down-stream metabolism of Kyn would prevent/treat metabolic syndrome. This is a pre-clinical trial of the effect of benserazide (BRZ), an inhibitor of the key enzymes of Kyn metabolism, on olanzapine-induced mouse model of metabolic syndrome. Olanzapine is one of the most effective atypical antipsychotics but has high potential to induce metabolic syndrome. Olanzapine (4 mg/kg, p.o) and/or BRZ (100 mg/day, p.o.) were administered to 6-week-old C57Bl/6 female mice,  days/week, for 10 weeks. The study was approved by the Tufts Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. BRZ attenuated olanzapine-induced excessive weight gain, impairment of glucose tolerance, and elevation of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides. Present results suggest that peripheral down-stream Kyn metabolism is a new target for prevention/treatment of olanzapine-induced metabolic syndrome.

We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (2.2%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16. vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs  days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (2.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs .0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.2%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2., 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Herein the capacity of the subfractions (SFs) SF1, SF2, and SF3 from the Cucumis sativus aqueous fraction and their combinations (M) to control adipocyte dysfunction in vitro, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was studied. Adipocytes, previously treated with dexamethasone or IL-1 to induce dysfunction, were incubated with different concentrations of the subfractions for 24 h. 2-deoxyglucose consumption and glycerol release were evaluated, and a surface model was constructed to determine the most effective SF concentrations to improve both parameters. Effective SF combinations were assessed in their capacity to control metabolic, pro-oxidative, and pro-inflammatory conditions. SF1, SF2 (40 μg/ml each) and SF3 (20 μg/ml) improved 2-deoxyglucose consumption by 87%, 57%, and 87%, respectively. SF1 and SF2 ( μg/ml each) and SF3 (40 μg/mL) increased glycerol secretion by 10.6%, 18.9%, and 11.8%, respectively. Among five combinations tested, only M4 (SF1 40 μg/ml:SF2 60 μg/ml:SF3 30 μg/ml) and M5 (SF1 40 μg/ml:SF2 60 μg/mL:SF3 10 μg/ml) controlled effectively the metabolic, pro-oxidative, and proinflammatory conditions studied.

In response to FFAs, skeletal muscle can secrete a variety of cytokines. Irisin, one such muscle-secreted cytokine, can improve glucose tolerance, glucose uptake, and lipid metabolism. It is produced by the transmembrane protein fibronectin type Ⅲ domain containing  (FNDC5) by specific proteases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the FNDC5 response to palmitate and their relationships with  in C2C12 myotubes. RNA sequencing analysis results from C2C12 myotubes treated with palmitate showed that palmitate could activate the TGF-β signaling pathway. Palmitate directly affected the expression of Smad3, but not its phosphorylation level, in C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, knockdown and knockout of Smad3 alleviated the inhibitory effect of palmitate on the expression of FNDC5. In contrast, overexpression of Smad3 aggravated the inhibition of FNDC5 expression. There is a Smad3 binding motif in the -660 bp to -649 bp region of the Fndc5 promoter. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of this region also alleviated the inhibition of FNDC5 expression in response to palmitate. More importantly, inhibition of FNDC5 expression mediated by Smad3 led to a decrease in  sensitivity in C2C12 myotubes. Collectively, these findings suggest that palmitate could induce  through Smad3-mediated down-regulation of the Fndc5 gene.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study is to evaluate the association of the three cytokines and glucose homeostasis.This was a cross-sectional study of children with obesity ranging from  to 14 years compared to age- and sex-matched children of normal weight. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), oral glucose tolerance test 2-hour plasma glucose (OGTT2hPG), and  (INS) were measured, and serum adropin, GLP2, and ANGPTL4 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The body mass index (BMI), BMI-Z scores, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) were calculated.Thirty-nine children (9.70 ± 1.71 years, 18 females) with obesity and 29 normal weight children (8.98 ± 1.98 years, 16 females) were assessed. The levels of INS, HOMA-IR and GLP2 of the obesity group were significantly higher than the controls (P < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed that serum GLP2 was positively associated with WHR, FPG, and OGTT2hPG, and adropin was negatively associated with BMI, BMI-Z, WHR, INS, and HOMA-IR (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, GLP2 were negatively associated with adropin and ANGPTL4 (both P < 0.05). By binary logistic regression, adropin and GLP2 were found to be independent markers of obesity. Multiple linear regression showed that GLP2 was associated with OGTT2hPG, and adropin was associated with INS and HOMA-IR (all P < 0.05).Obese children had elevated GLP2 concentrations, and adropin and GLP2 associated with both childhood obesity and glucose homeostasis.

Adipokines may influence the inflammatory response and contribute to development of metabolic abnormalities in CHC. Visfatin exerts immunomodulatory and -mimetic effects. The aim was to measure visfatin serum concentrations and its mRNA hepatic expression in non-obese CHC patients and to assess the relationships with metabolic and histological parameters.In a group of 63 non-obese CHC patients (29 M/34 F) infected with genotype 1b aged 46.6 ±14.6 years, body mass index (BMI) 24.8 ±3.0 kg/m, serum visfatin levels and its mRNA hepatic expression were examined and the subsequent associations with metabolic and histopathological features were assessed.Serum visfatin levels were significantly higher in CHC patients compared to controls (22.7 ±.7 vs. 17.8 ±1. ng/ml,  < 0.001). There was no difference in serum visfatin and its mRNA hepatic expression regardless of sex, BMI,  sensitivity and lipids concentrations. There was no mutual correlation between serum visfatin and visfatin mRNA hepatic expression. Hepatic visfatin mRNA levels but not visfatin serum levels were higher in patients with steatosis (1.35 ±0.75 vs. 0.98 ±0.34,  = 0.009).Serum visfatin levels may reflect its involvement in chronic inflammatory processes accompanying HCV infection. Increased visfatin mRNA hepatic expression in patients with steatosis seems to be a compensatory mechanism enabling hepatocytes to survive metabolic abnormalities resulting from virus-related lipid droplet deposition prerequisite to HCV replication.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602234>Effect of HCV treatment response on : A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Sustained virological response (SVR) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients treated with pegylated interferon α-2a and ribavirin is associated with reduced  (IR), measured as a reduction of homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) scores after 24 weeks of therapy, and reduced fasting serum  and serum glucose levels. The present meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of HCV treatment response on IR in HCV patients who achieved SVR and those who did not (non-SVR) after receiving interferon (IFN)-based therapy. The PubMed, Cochrane and Embase databases were searched using combinations of the following search terms: 'HCV', 'hepatitis C', 'interferon', 'antiviral', 'treatment response' and ''. The incidence of IR, HOMA-IR and HOMA-β, as well as fasting glucose and fasting  levels, were summarized in terms of basal values and values after the end of treatment for each study. A total of 8 studies were included in the final analysis. There was no significant difference in the reduction in IR between the SVR and non-SVR groups (odds ratio, 0.995; 95% CI=0.613-1.616; P=0.984). However, the SVR group had a significantly higher mean reduction in HOMA-IR (difference in means=-0.485; 95%CI=-0.713 to -0.256; P<0.001) and HOMA-β (difference in means=-15.448; 95%CI=-23.326 to -7.570; P<0.001) compared to the non-SVR group. In conclusion, HCV patients who achieved SVR after IFN-based therapy exhibited improvement in HOMA-IR and HOMA-β. The present results suggest that clinical management of IR and serum glucose levels may be an important way to impact the therapeutic response in HCV patients.Copyright: © Hu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31538138>Air pollution-associated changes in biomarkers of diabetes risk.</a></h1><p>Ambient particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxide (NO) air pollution may be diabetogenic.To examine longitudinal associations of short- and longer-term mean PM ≤10 μm (PM), PM ≤2. μm (PM), and NO concentrations with five biomarkers of diabetes risk.We studied a stratified, random minority oversample of nondiabetic Women's Health Initiative clinical trials participants with biomarkers and geocoded participant address-specific mean air pollution concentrations available at repeated visits (years = 1993-2004; n = 3,915; mean age = 62.7 years; 84% white). We log-transformed the biomarkers, then used multi-level, mixed-effects, longitudinal models weighted for sampling design/attrition and adjusted for sociodemographic, clinical, and meteorological covariates to estimate their associations with air pollutants.Biomarkers exhibited null to suggestively negative associations with short- and longer-term PM and NO concentrations, e.g., -3.1% (-6.1%, 0.1%), lower homeostatic model assessment of  per 10 μg/m increase in 12-month PM. A statistically significant interaction by impaired fasting glucose (IFG) at baseline in this analysis indicated potentially adverse effects only among women with versus without IFG, i.e., 1.4% (-3.%, 6.%) versus -4.6% (-7.9%, -1.1%),   < 0.05. In contrast, longer-term PM concentrations were largely but not statistically significantly associated with higher biomarkers.Low-level short-term PM and NO concentrations may have negligible adverse effects on biomarkers of diabetes risk. Although longer-term mean PM concentrations showed primarily null associations with these biomarkers, results suggestively indicated that PM exposure over the range of concentrations experienced in the United States may adversely affect biomarkers of diabetes risk at the population level, as may longer-term mean PM concentrations among women with IFG.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622641>Body surface area and glucose tolerance - The smaller the person, the greater the 2-hour plasma glucose.</a></h1><p>The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is standardized globally with a uniform glucose load of 75 g to all adults irrespective of body size. An inverse association between body height and 2-hour postload plasma glucose (2hPG) has been demonstrated. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between body surface area (BSA) and plasma glucose values during an OGTT.An OGTT was performed on 2659 individuals at increased cardiovascular risk aged between 45 and 70 years of age, who had not previously been diagnosed with diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Their BSA was calculated according to the Mosteller formula. Study subjects were divided into five BSA levels corresponding to 12., 25, 25, 25, and 12.% of the total distribution.When adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, alcohol intake, current smoking, and leisure-time physical activity, BSA level showed an inverse linear relationship with the 2hPG in all categories of glucose tolerance (p for linearity < 0.001). Moreover, the smaller the adjusted BSA of the study person, the higher the proportion of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes based on 2hPG in the OGTT.Body size has a considerable impact on the findings from a standardized OGTT. Smaller persons are more likely to be diagnosed as glucose intolerant than relatively larger sized individuals.This work was supported by the State Provincial Office of Western Finland, the Central Satakunta Health Federation of Municipalities, Satakunta Hospital District, and the Hospital District of Southwest Finland.Evidence before this study. We searched PubMed using the MeSH terms "glucose tolerance test", "body surface area", "body height", "body size", "glucose tolerance", "", "blood glucose" and "diabetes mellitus" on March 10, 2019 without language restrictions. We also used Cited Reference Search in Web of Science for relevant articles. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is standardized globally with a uniform glucose load of 75 g to all adults irrespective of body size. An inverse association between body height and 2-hour postload plasma glucose (2hPG) has been demonstrated. Several studies have shown that 2hPG predicts all-cause mortality better than elevated fasting glucose. However, body height or body surface area are not usually adjusted in epidemiological studies. It is well known that short adult stature is a risk factor for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Added value of this study. This is the first study to assess the relationship of body surface area and 2hPG in a typical primary care population at increased cardiovascular risk. Body surface area has a considerable impact on the result of a standardized OGTT. Smaller individuals are more likely to be diagnosed as glucose intolerant than relatively larger sized individuals. Implications of all the available evidence. There is a possibility that the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes made by an OGTT is a false positive result in a relatively small individual, and a false negative result in a relatively larger individual. Association of 2hPG concentrations and mortality may be influenced by body size as confounding factor. Given that the OGTT is a time and effort consuming test both for patients and laboratory personnel, validity of the OGTT for different body sizes should be reconsidered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

There is a relationship between the high activity of this enzyme and the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, , metabolic syndrome and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)--((benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats. The in vitro results showed that C1 was a better inhibitor of human 11β-HSD1 than CLX. The ex vivo assay results demonstrated that C1 was capable of reducing 11β-HSD1 overexpression in mesenteric adipose tissue. Therefore, C1 was able to decrease the activity and expression of 11β-HSD1 better than CLX.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637670>What Is the Role of the New Index Relative Fat Mass (RFM) in the Assessment of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)?</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the liver manifestation of adiposopathy. Recently, a new score was developed to estimate body fat percentage (relative fat mass, RFM). We aimed to evaluate the value of RFM in predicting the presence and severity of NAFLD, compared with other anthropometric measurements.RFM, body mass index (BMI), and other anthropometric measurements were evaluated in two cohorts of subjects: a cohort from a Portuguese prospective epidemiological study (e_Cor) and morbidly obese patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. We evaluated if RFM and BMI were related with the presence and severity of liver disease, which was assessed by noninvasive tools in the first cohort and by liver histology in the morbidly obese cohort. The independence of relations found in univariate analysis was assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis.In the general population cohort, 744 subjects (48% male) were enrolled. BMI-defined obesity was present in 23% and RFM-defined obesity in 86%.  (IR) related with BMI-defined obesity (OR 4.37 [2.16-8.84]) and weight (OR 1.05 [1.02-1.08]) in men, and waist circumference (WC) (OR 1.07 [1.03-1.11]) in women. Dyslipidemia and hypertension related with RFM-defined obesity in men (OR 2.96 [1.36-6.47] and OR .37 [1.31-22.06], respectively). Ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD in 33% related with weight in men (OR 1.03 [1.003-1.06] and WC in women (OR 1.06 [1.02-1.10]). In men, ALT elevation related with weight (OR 1.04 [1.02-1.07]). In women, advanced fibrosis (estimated by NAFLD Fibrosis Score) associated with BMI-defined obesity (OR 42.43 [3.61-498.13]). In the morbidly obese cohort, 152 subjects were enrolled, of whom 84% were female, 37% had steatohepatitis, and 9.4% had advanced fibrosis. Adiponectin associated inversely and leptin positively with RFM in men. The severity of steatosis increased linearly with BMI and WC in women. Higher BMI associated with steatohepatitis in women and advanced fibrosis in men.RFM-defined obesity better predicted dyslipidemia and hypertension (though not IR) and adipokine imbalance; however, it did not add value to BMI-defined obesity in predicting NAFLD or liver injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571892>Retrospective study of cardiovascular disease risk factors among a cohort of combat veterans with lower limb amputation.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have shown that veterans with lower limb amputation have a higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with population-based controls. American veterans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan with lower limb amputation may be at a similarly higher risk.The Navel Health Research Center (NHRC) maintains the Expeditionary Medical Encounter Database (EMED) of military personnel who have sustained combat limb amputation or serious limb injury during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Department of Veterans Affairs data from 2003 to April 2015 was used to analyze CVD risk factors in this cohort. Veterans with either unilateral (n=442) or bilateral (n146) lower limb amputation were compared to those with serious lower limb trauma without amputation (n=184). Multivariate regression was used to measure associations between lower limb amputation and CVD risk factors over an average of 8 years of follow-up. Outcomes included mean arterial pressure (MAP), low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and serum triglycerides (TG).Compared with the limb injury group, those with unilateral lower limb amputation had significantly lower HDL (<0.05) and higher TG (<0.05). Those with bilateral lower limb amputation had significantly higher MAP (<0.05), lower HDL (<0.01), and higher TG (<0.001). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome, defined as type 2 diabetes or a constellation of blood pressure and lipid changes consistent with metabolic syndrome, was 8.7%, 14.9%, and 21.9% for limb injury, unilateral amputation, and bilateral amputation groups, respectively. Veterans with bilateral lower limb amputation had a 2.25-increased odds ratio (95% confidence interval 1.19-.05) of type 2 diabetes or blood pressure and lipid changes consistent with metabolic syndrome compared to those with limb injury.Results suggest that veterans with lower limb amputation have a higher risk for metabolic syndrome. Primary care interventions to manage weight, blood pressure, and lipid levels are fundamental in order to reduce cardiac risk in this relatively young cohort.© 2019 Bhatnagar et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31479766>Hydrogen sulfide potentiates the favorable metabolic effects of inorganic nitrite in type 2 diabetic rats.</a></h1><p>Decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and hydrogen sulfide (HS) deficiency have been linked with the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Restoration of NO levels by nitrite have been associated with favorable metabolic effects in T2D. Moreover, HS can potentiate the effects of NO in the cardiovascular system. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of long-term co-administration of sodium nitrite and sodium hydrosulfide (NaSH) on carbohydrate metabolism in type 2 diabetic rats.T2D was induced using chronic high fat diet (HFD) feeding combined with low dose streptozotocin (STZ) regimen. Rats were divided into  groups (N = 10/group): Control, T2D, T2D + nitrite, T2D + NaSH, and T2D + nitrite + NaSH. Nitrite (50 mg/L in drinking water) and NaSH (0.28 mg/kg, daily i. p. injection) were administered for 9 weeks. Fasting serum glucose, , lipid profile, liver function tests, and oxidative stress indices were measured. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed at the end of the eighth week, and three days later, intraperitoneal pyruvate tolerance test (PTT) was done. Protein levels and mRNA expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) in soleus muscle and epididymal adipose tissue as well as mRNA expression of HS-producing enzymes in the liver, soleus muscle, and epididymal adipose tissue were measured at the end of the study.Compared to the controls, HFD and STZ treated rats developed metabolic dysfunction. Nitrite treatment improved carbohydrate metabolism, liver function, and oxidative stress indices whereas NaSH treatment per se had no significant effects. However, co-administration of NaSH and nitrite resulted in further improvement in serum  level, GTT, PTT, liver function, oxidative stress, protein level and mRNA expression of GLUT4, as well as mRNA expression of HS-producing enzymes in diabetic rats.Low dose of NaSH per se had no effect on carbohydrate metabolism while it potentiated the favorable metabolic effects of inorganic nitrite in type 2 diabetic rats. These favorable effects were associated with decreased oxidative stress and increased GLUT4 expression in -sensitive tissues as well as improvement of liver function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In addition to lowering glucose in diabetes, these drugs may also protect against hyperlipidaemia and arteriosclerosis, which are risk factors for stroke. This is an update of a review first published in January 2014 and subsequently updated in December 2017.To assess the efficacy and safety of PPAR-γ agonists in the secondary prevention of stroke and related vascular events for people with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (30 July 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1949 to 30 July 2019), Embase (1980 to 30 July 2019), CINAHL (1982 to 30 July 2019), AMED (1985 to 30 July 2019), and 11 Chinese databases (30 July 2019). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials, we searched ongoing trials registers, reference lists, and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies. We did not impose any language restrictions.We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating PPAR-γ agonists versus placebo for the secondary prevention of stroke and related vascular events in people with stroke or TIA, with the outcomes of recurrent stroke, vascular events, and adverse events.Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted eligible data, cross-checked the data for accuracy, and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias. We evaluated the quality of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.We identified five RCTs with 5039 participants; two studies had a low risk of bias for all domains. Four studies evaluated the drug pioglitazone, and one study evaluated rosiglitazone. The participants in different studies were heterogeneous.Recurrent strokeThree studies evaluated the number of participants with recurrent stroke (4979 participants, a single study contributing 3876 of these). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists probably reduce the recurrence of stroke compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.99; moderate-quality evidence).Adverse eventsEvidence that adverse events occurred more frequently in participants treated with PPAR-γ agonists when compared with placebo was uncertain due to wide confidence interval and high levels of statistical heterogeneity: risk difference 10%, 95% CI -8% to 28%; low-quality evidence).Data were available on additional composite outcomes reflecting serious vascular events (all-cause death and other major vascular events; all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) from one study in 984 people. This study provided low-quality evidence that PPAR-γ agonists led to fewer events (data not meta-analysed).Vascular eventsPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists given over a mean duration of 34. months in a single trial of 984 participants may reduce serious vascular events expressed as a composite outcome of total events of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.99; low-quality evidence).Other outcomesOne study in 20 people measured  sensitivity, and one study in 40 people measured the ubiquitin-proteasome activity in carotid plaques. Our confidence in the improvements observed with PPAR-γ agonists were limited by small sample sizes and risk of bias. None of the studies reported the number of participants with disability due to vascular events or improvement in quality of life.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists probably reduce recurrent stroke and total events of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke, and may improve  sensitivity and the stabilisation of carotid plaques. Their effects on adverse events are uncertain. Our conclusions should be interpreted with caution considering the small number and the quality of the included studies. Further well-designed, double-blind RCTs with large samples are required to assess the efficacy and safety of PPAR-γ agonists in the secondary prevention of stroke and related vascular events in people with stroke or TIA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637465>Cardiovascular responses to a glucose drink in young male individuals with overweight/obesity and mild alterations in glucose metabolism, but without impaired glucose tolerance.</a></h1><p>Little is known about whether mild aberrations in glucose metabolism, which are seen in overweight/obese subjects (OW/OB) without impaired glucose tolerance, affect regulator control elements for blood pressure homeostasis.Hence, we measured in age-matched male subjects with normal weight (n = 16; BMI = 22.4 kg m) and OW/OB (n = 11; BMI = 28.6 kg m) continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, myocardial contractility and baroreflex sensitivity during a 30 min baseline and for 120 min after the ingestion of 75 g glucose dissolved in 300 mL tap water (OGTT).

In response to the glucose drink, and in comparison to subjects with normal weight, we observed in subjects with OW/OB a trend towards increased plasma  levels (+7445 ± 4858 vs. +4968 ± 1924 mU h L; p = 0.08), which was not seen for blood glucose (p = 0.59). Moreover, subjects with OW/OB showed impaired peripheral vasodilation, diminished heart rate and myocardial contractility responses but increased peripheral pulse pressure (all p < 0.05).Young male subjects with OW/OB, but without glucose intolerance or hypertension, showed attenuated peripheral vasodilation and diminished cardiac responses to a glucose drink.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575611>-Hydroxymethylcytosines in Circulating Cell-Free DNA Reveal Vascular Complications of Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h1><p>Long-term complications of type 2 diabetes (T2D), such as macrovascular and microvascular events, are the major causes for T2D-related disability and mortality. A clinically convenient, noninvasive approach for monitoring the development of these complications would improve the overall life quality of patients with T2D and help reduce healthcare burden through preventive interventions.A selective chemical labeling strategy for -hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC-Seal) was used to profile genome-wide 5hmCs, an emerging class of epigenetic markers implicated in complex diseases including diabetes, in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from a collection of Chinese patients (n = 62). Differentially modified 5hmC markers between patients with T2D with and without macrovascular/microvascular complications were analyzed under a case-control design.Statistically significant changes in 5hmC markers were associated with T2D-related macrovascular/microvascular complications, involving genes and pathways relevant to vascular biology and diabetes, including  and inflammation. A 16-gene 5hmC marker panel accurately distinguished patients with vascular complications from those without [testing set: area under the curve (AUC) = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73-0.96], outperforming conventional clinical variables such as urinary albumin. In addition, a separate 13-gene 5hmC marker panel could distinguish patients with single complications from those with multiple complications (testing set: AUC = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.68-0.99), showing superiority over conventional clinical variables.The 5hmC markers in cfDNA reflected the epigenetic changes in patients with T2D who developed macrovascular/microvascular complications. The 5hmC-Seal assay has the potential to be a clinically convenient, noninvasive approach that can be applied in the clinic to monitor the presence and severity of diabetic vascular complications.© 2019 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529423>Endothelial and Autonomic Dysfunction at Early Stages of Glucose Intolerance and in Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h1><p>This study evaluated sE-selectin, Endothelin-1, and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) at early stages of glucose intolerance and in metabolic syndrome (MetS). A total of 87 subjects - 39 males, of mean age 45.7±11.6 years and mean BMI 31.4±6.6 kg/m, divided according to glucose tolerance and the presence of MetS were enrolled. Glucose tolerance was studied during OGTT. Anthropometric indices, blood pressure, HbA1c, lipids, hsCRP, sE-selectin, Endothelin-1, and immunoreactive  were measured. Body composition was assessed by a bioimpedance method (InBody 720, BioSpace). Tissue AGEs accumulation was evaluated by skin autofluorescence (AGE-Reader, DiagnOpticsTM). CAN was assessed by ANX-3.0 technology. In the groups, according to glucose tolerance, the prevalence of CAN was .7% in normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 8.6% in prediabetes, and 23.% in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (NDD). In the groups, according to the presence of MetS, the prevalence of CAN was 12.3% in those with MetS and 4.8% in those without MetS. Parasympathetic activity was diminished at rest (p=0.048, 0.015, respectively) in NDD as compared to prediabetes and NGT; and there was a numerically elevated heart rate at rest in NDD in comparison to NGT. There was a negative correlation between parasympathetic tone and waist circumference, BMI, and visceral and total fat. There was no difference in the measured endothelial function markers in the groups according to glucose tolerance and MetS. sE-selectin correlated with HOMA-IR (r=0.275, p=0.048). No association between Endothelin-1 levels and assessed metabolic parameters was observed. There is a high prevalence of CAN at early stages of glucose intolerance and in MetS, due to decreased parasympathetic activity.

However, the effects of fucoidans on MetS were still not clear. In this study, we evaluated the activity of fucoidan from  (FvF) on attenuating MetS and first elucidated the underlying mechanism. In vitro, FvF treatment remarkably lowered the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with the sodium palmitate (PA)-induced  (IR) group. The phosphorylation level of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was significantly decreased, while phosphorylation of protein kinase B (pAkt) level increased, compared with that of the HepG2 cells treated with PA. Thus, FvF increased glucose consumption and relieved IR via ROS-mediated JNK and Akt signaling pathways. In addition, these changes were accompanied by the activation of adenosine '-monophosphate-ativated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream targets (e.g., HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1C)), which improved lipid metabolism in IR HepG2 cells. In vivo, FvF improved hyperglycemia and decreased serum  level in mice with MetS. Furthermore, we evaluated the inhibition of glucose transport by in vitro (Caco-2 monolayer model), semi-in vivo (everted gut sac model) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which indicated that FvF could significantly reduce the absorption of glucose into the blood stream, thus it could improve blood-glucose levels and IR in mice with MetS. Moreover, FvF decreased serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and liver lipid accumulation, while increased the serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level in mice with MetS. Therefore, FvF could be considered as a potential candidate for the treatment of MetS by alleviating IR, inhibiting glucose transportation, and regulating lipid metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634780>High glucose inhibits myogenesis and induces  by down-regulating AKT signaling.</a></h1><p>A high glucose level is usually considered to be the factor that induces tissue and cell dysfunction and damage, commonly known as "glucose toxicity".This study aimed to explore the effects and the potential molecular mechanisms of high glucose on myoblast differentiation and  sensitivity.C2C12 cells were cultured in differentiation medium containing 25, 40, or 60 mM glucose for 1, 3, or  days. E-MHC positive area and GLUT4 fluorescence were evaluated through Immunofluorescence. The expression of Myf5, MyoD, myogenin were measured by performing western blot and qRT-PCR. The protein expression of GLUT4 on cell membrane and glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes were measured through western blot and 2-NBDG assay. AKT activator SC79 and inhibitor MK2206 was utilized to reveal the important role of AKT signaling in myogenesis and  sensitivity inhibited by high glucose.60 mM glucose inhibits myogenesis by decreasing the expression of MyoD and myogenin, and induces  by reducing both basal and -stimulated GLUT4 expressions and glucose uptakes. The influences of high glucose on myogenesis and IR was related to decreased AKT activation. SC79 rescued the inhibition of high glucose on myogenesis and attenuated IR. MK2206 inhibits the myogenic differentiation and induces IR.The present study reveals that high glucose inhibited myogenisis accompanied by inducing IR, through AKT signaling inhibition, which may help to further research for resisting degenerative muscular diseases caused by glucose metabolism disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Our laboratory previously developed a controlled-release mitochondrial protonophore (CRMP) that is functionally liver-targeted and promotes oxidation of hepatic triglycerides. Although we previously demonstrated that CRMP safely reverses hypertriglyceridemia, fatty liver, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in diet-induced rodent models of obesity, there remains a critical need to assess its safety and efficacy in a model highly relevant to humans. Here, we evaluated the impact of longer-term CRMP treatment on hepatic mitochondrial oxidation and on the reversal of hypertriglyceridemia, NAFLD, and  in high-fat, fructose-fed cynomolgus macaques ( 6) and spontaneously obese dysmetabolic rhesus macaques ( 12). Using positional isotopomer nuclear magnetic resonance tracer analysis (PINTA), we demonstrated that acute CRMP treatment (single dose,  mg/kg) increased rates of hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation by 40%. Six weeks of CRMP treatment reduced hepatic triglycerides in both nonhuman primate models independently of changes in body weight, food intake, body temperature, or adverse reactions. CRMP treatment was also associated with a 20 to 30% reduction in fasting plasma triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in dysmetabolic nonhuman primates. Oral administration of CRMP reduced endogenous glucose production by 18%, attributable to a 20% reduction in hepatic acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) content [as assessed by whole-body β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) turnover] and pyruvate carboxylase flux. Collectively, these studies provide proof-of-concept data to support the development of liver-targeted mitochondrial uncouplers for the treatment of metabolic syndrome in humans.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In addition, donkey milk was regarded as a medicinal food and substitute product for infant formula in some ancient western countries. Chinese ancient medical books documented the medicinal value of donkey milk, using donkey milk to treat diabetes, cough and jaundice.To investigate the donkey milk's components and anti-diabetic effect of donkey milk in vitro and in vivo and to study the molecular mechanism of donkey milk was an anti-diabetic medication.In this study, the gastrointestinal digested donkey milk was simulated in vitro and its products of protein digestion were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. We then performed cell viability assay,  secretion assay, animal experiments and ELISA assays to study the anti-diabetic effect of donkey milk in vitro and in vivo. Donkey milk's anti-diabetic molecular mechanism and specific targets were detected by using quantitative real time PCR.Lysozyme (LZ) and α-lactalbumin (α-La) exhibited significantly lower digestibility and higher retention than the other components of donkey milk. In vitro, 500 μg/mL of donkey milk could improve damaged β-cells viability significantly (P < 0.0001). In vivo, the blood glucose and HOMA-IR of diabetic rats treated with donkey milk were 14.23 ± .18 mM and 74.94 ± 23.62, respectively, whereas the diabetic group were 22.18 ± 2.23 mM and 112.16 ± 18.44, respectively (P < 0.01). The SOD value of donkey milk group was 265.87 ± 21.29 U/L, while the SOD value of diabetic group was 193.20 ± 52.07 U/L (P < 0.05).

Eleven women (BMI 36.3 kg/m) who were recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes based on HbA1c over 6.% (8.9%) volunteered to participate in an intensive dietary intervention to limit dietary carbohydrates to under 30 grams daily for 90 days. The main outcome was to determine the degree of change in HbA1c, while secondary outcomes included body weight, blood pressure, and blood lipids. The volunteers lost significant weight (85.7 ± 3.2 kg to 76.7 ± 2.8 kg) and lowered systolic (134.0 ± 1.6 to 123.3 ± 1.1 mmHg) and diastolic (89.9 ± 1.3 to 82.6 ± 1.0 mmHg) blood pressure. HbA1c dropped to .6%. Most blood lipids were significantly altered, including HDL cholesterol (43.1 ± 4.4 to 52.3 ± 3.3 mg/dl), triglycerides (177.0 ± 19.8 to 92.1 ± 8.7 mg/dl), and the TG : HDL ratio (4.7 ± 0.8 to 1.9 ± 0.2). LDL cholesterol was not significantly different. AST and ALT, plasma markers of liver health, were reported for eight patients and revealed no significant changes. These findings indicate that a short-term intervention emphasizing protein and fat at the expense of dietary carbohydrate functionally reversed the diabetes diagnosis, as defined by HbA1c. Furthermore, the intervention lowered body weight and blood pressure, while eliciting favorable changes in blood lipids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534089>Predictors of  Secretion in Japanese Patients with Histopathologically-confirmed Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Objective The correlation between the  secretion levels and the risk of hepatocarcinogenesis is clinically important. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of various clinical parameters on C-peptide (CPR) levels in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods In this retrospective cohort study, the effects of clinical parameters on  (HOMA-IR) and  secretion levels (HOMA-β and fasting CPR) were investigated. Patients or Materials A total of 244 Japanese patients with histopathologically confirmed NAFLD were evaluated. Of these, 77 underwent the meal tolerance test (MTT) to evaluate the association of various clinical parameters with the CPR levels at 120 minutes. Results A multivariate analysis identified fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (≥110 mg/dL), AST (≥1.0×ULN IU/L), and a large waist circumference as independent predictors of  (HOMA-IR ≥2.) or high fasting CPR levels. Significant parameters for a low  secretion capacity (HOMA-β <30%) were not detected, except for the parameters mentioned in the diagnostic criteria of diabetes mellitus. Regarding the MTT, the CPR levels at 120 minutes were significantly higher in patients with fibrosis stage 3-4 than in those with stage 0-2. Body composition and genetic variation did not affect the CPR levels at 120 minutes. A multivariate analysis identified fibrosis stage (3-4), hyperuricemia, FPG (≥110 mg/dL), and procollagen III peptide (>1.0 U/mL) as independent predictors of high CPR levels at 120 minutes. Conclusion The present study showed that high plasma glucose levels and severe liver fibrosis stage influence  secretion levels in Japanese patients with NAFLD. Conservation of delayed  secretion levels was confirmed in patients with severe liver fibrosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579190>Single point  sensitivity estimator as an index for  sensitivity for metabolic syndrome: A study in North Indian population.</a></h1><p>Various indices for estimating  sensitivity, based on glucose tolerance test and fasting  levels, have been devised. However, they are laborious, time-consuming, and costly. Recently, a new index, single point  sensitivity estimator (SPISE) based on TG, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and body mass index (BMI) was proposed in the European population and was found comparable to gold standard test. Decreased  sensitivity is a hallmark of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Hence, the current study was planned to determine the optimal cutoff of SPISE with high sensitivity and specificity in MetS patients of the North Indian population.A community-based cross-sectional study including 229 MetS cases and 248 controls was conducted. MetS was defined according to the South Asian Modified National Cholesterol Education Program criteria. SPISE index was calculated for cases and controls using the formula devised by Paulmichl .: SPISE = 600 × HDL-C/(TG × BMI). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted for determining optimal cutoff for SPISE in MetS.SPISE was significantly lower in MetS patients (.35 ± 1.35) than that for controls (7.45 ± 2) with  < 0.05 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.79-2.41). ROC curve showed area under the curve = 0.83 for SPISE ( < 0.05, CI: 0.79-0.86), showing SPISE to have good predictive ability to discriminate MetS cases from controls. The cutoff value of SPISE index for predicting  sensitivity in MetS was found out to be .82 with sensitivity and specificity of 73% and 80%, respectively. This cutoff is lower than the European population (6.61), indicating higher  (IR) in the study population.SPISE could be a useful potential low-cost indicator with high sensitivity and specificity for predicting IR in MetS.Copyright: © 2019 Journal of Laboratory Physicians.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599919>A ketone monoester drink reduces the glycemic response to an oral glucose challenge in individuals with obesity: a randomized trial.</a></h1><p>Exogenous ketones make it possible to reach a state of ketosis that may improve metabolic control in humans.The main objective of this study was to determine whether the ingestion of a ketone monoester (KE) drink before a 2-h oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) would lower blood glucose concentrations. Secondary objectives were to determine the impact of KE on nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration and glucoregulatory hormones.We conducted a randomized controlled crossover experiment in 15 individuals with obesity (mean ± SD age: 47 ± 10 y; BMI: 34 ±  kg/m2). After an overnight fast, participants consumed a KE drink [(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate; 0.45 mL/kg body weight] or taste-matched control drink 30 min before completing a 75-g OGTT. Participants and study personnel performing laboratory analyses were blinded to each condition.The KE increased d-β-hydroxybutyrate to a maximum of ∼3.4 mM (P < 0.001) during the OGTT. Compared with the control drink, KE reduced glucose (-11%, P = 0.002), NEFA (-21%, P = 0.009), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (-31%, P = 0.001) areas under the curve (AUCs), whereas glucagon AUC increased (+11%, P = 0.030). No differences in triglyceride, C-peptide, and  AUCs were observed after the KE drink. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased and heart rate increased after the KE drink (both P < 0.01).A KE drink consumed before an OGTT lowered glucose and NEFA AUCs with no increase in circulating . Our results suggest that a single drink of KE may acutely improve metabolic control in individuals with obesity. Future research is warranted to examine whether KE could be used safely to have longer-term effects on metabolic control.

Integrating the autonomic dysfunction into the pathogenesis of MetS creates the possibility of including a range of nosologies affecting treatment and clinical manifestations of pathologies belonging to MetS into the MetS cluster The purpose of this work is to determine the involvement of autonomic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of associated pathological conditions in patients and MetS.A cross-sectional study was conducted. The sample consisted of 158 patients with metabolic syndrome. The patients underwent a physical examination, including BMI; a blood chemistry test with the determination of the hormonal status (, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone); a 24-hour monitoring of blood pressure (BP); an assessment of heart rate variability; studies showing the presence of gastric reflux (рН-measurement) or its damaging impact (endoscopy); men were tested with the IPSS-QOL questionnaire and underwent transrectal ultrasound of the prostate and ultrasound of the bladder.It is revealed that because of MetS, the occurrence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy reaches 37.%. Some features of gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients with MetS are shown. Regurgitation prevails in the structure of complaints. In case of fibrogastroduodenoscopy, an endoscopy-negative form of the disease occurs in 38%. According to the data of daily pH-measurement, when DeMeester score is high, in the supine position, 25% of time accounts for alkaline reflux (рН > 7). It is found out that young men experience the enlargement of prostate volume and size; according to the IPSS questionnaire, the scores correspond to the initial manifestations of hyperplastic diseases of the prostate gland due to  and normal level of androgens.The paper demonstrates that the autonomic dysfunction of nervous system (on a par with ) is the main link in the development of MetS. This provides the basis for including the mentioned states - cardiac autonomic neuropathy, lower urinary tract symptoms and gastroesophageal reflux disease - into the MetS cluster.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601326>[Effect of vitamin D supplementation on gestational diabetes mellitus:a Meta-analysis].</a></h1><p>This Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial( RCT) was conducted to summarize the preventive and therapeutic effects of vitamin D supplementation on gestational diabetes mellitus( GDM).The electronic database( CNKI, CBM, VIP, PubMed, Cochrane library, Web of Science) were systematically searched from inception to February 2018, using the keywords vitamin D and gestational diabetes to identify Meta-analysis.A total of 16 RCTs were included.

A large observational study.</a></h1><p>We aimed to investigate which clinical and metabolic tests offer optimal accuracy and acceptability to help diagnose diabetes among a large sample of people with serious mental illness in receipt of antipsychotic medication.A prospective observational study design of biochemical and clinical factors was used. Biochemical measures were fasting glucose,  and lipids, oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), hemoglobin A1c, and  assessed with the homeostatic model (HOMA-IR) were determined in a consecutive cohort of 798 adult psychiatric inpatients receiving antipsychotics. Clinical variables were gender, age, global assessment of functioning (GAF), mental health clinicians' global impression (CGI), duration of severe mental illness, height, weight, BMI and waist/hip ratio. In addition, we calculated the risk using combined clinical predictors using the Leicester Practice Risk Score (LPRS) and the Topics Diabetes Risk Score (TDRS). Diabetes was defined by older criteria (impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or OGTT) as well as2010 criteria (IFG or OGTT or Glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c)) at conventional cut-offs.Using the older criteria, 7.8% had diabetes (men: 6.3%; women: 10.3%). Using the new criteria, 10.2% had diabetes (men: 8.2%, women: 13.2%), representing a 30.7% increase (p = 0.02) in the prevalence of diabetes. Regarding biochemical predictors, conventional OGTT, IFG, and HbA1c thresholds used to identify newly defined diabetes missed 25%, 50% and 75% of people with diabetes, respectively. The conventional HBA1c cut-point of ≥6.% (48 mmol/mol) missed 7 of 10 newly defined cases of diabetes while a cut-point of ≥.7% improved sensitivity from 44.4% to up to 85%. Specific algorithm approaches offered reasonable accuracy. Unfortunately no single clinical factor was able to accurately rule-in a diagnosis of diabetes. Three clinical factors were able to rule-out diabetes with good accuracy namely: BMI, waist/hip ratio and height. A BMI < 30 had a 92% negative predictive value in ruling-out diabetes. Of those not diabetic, 20% had a BMI ≥ 30. However, for complete diagnosis a specific biochemical protocol is still necessary.Patients with SMI maintained on antipsychotic medication cannot be reliably screened for diabetes using clinical variables alone. Accurate assessment requires a two-step algorithm consisting of HBA1c ≥.7% followed by both FG and OGTT which does not require all patients to have OGTT and FG.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624366>Early life feeding and current dietary patterns are associated with biomarkers of glucose and lipid metabolism in young women from the Nutritionist's Health Study.</a></h1><p>We investigated if breastfeeding duration and current dietary patterns (DP) were associated with glucose and lipid metabolism biomarkers in women from the Nutritionist's Health Study.This is a cross-sectional analysis of 200 healthy undergraduates and nutrition graduates aged ≤45 years. Total [<6; ≥6 months] and predominant [<3; ≥3 months] breastfeeding were recalled using questionnaires. Diet were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. DP obtained by factor analysis by principal component were categorized into tertiles of adherence (T1 = reference). Glucose and lipid biomarkers were categorized into tertiles (T1 + T2 = reference). Logistic regression was applied considering minimal sufficient adjustment recommended by directed acyclic graphs.Median (interquartile range) age and BMI were 23.0 (20.0; 28.) years and 22.6 (20.7; 25.4) kg/m, respectively. Mean ± SD values of glucose, LDL-c and HDL-c were 82.0 ± 9.0, 101.1 ± 29.6 and 54.4 ± 12.4 mg/dL, respectively.

Predominant breastfeeding < 3 months was associated with  levels (OR = 2.27; 95%CI = 1.02-.02) and HOMA-IR (OR = 2.36; 95%CI = 1.06-.26). Breastfeeding was not associated with lipids. The Processed pattern was directly associated with LDL-c (T3: OR 6.08; 95%CI 1.80-20.58; P-trend = 0.004), while the Prudent pattern was inversely associated with LDL-c (T3: OR 0.26; 95%CI 0.08-0.87; P-trend = 0.029) and LDL-c/HDL-c ratio (T3: OR 0.28; 95%CI 0.08-0.97; P-trend = 0.046).Early feeding could be a protective factor against  development, while current DP were associated with lipid profile.

To address these questions, plasma metabolite patterns were determined every  min during exercise (30 min, ~45% of V̇O, ~63 W) and recovery in overnight-fasted sedentary, obese,  resistant women under controlled conditions of diet and physical activity. We hypothesized that improved fitness and  sensitivity following a ~14 wk training and weight loss intervention would lead to fixed workload plasma metabolomics signatures reflective of metabolic health and muscle metabolism. Pattern analysis over the first 15 min of exercise-regardless of pre- vs. post-intervention status-highlighted anticipated increases in fatty acid tissue uptake and oxidation (e.g., reduced long-chain fatty acids), diminution of non-oxidative fates of glucose (e.g., lowered sorbitol-pathway metabolites and glycerol-3-galactoside [possible glycerolipid synthesis metabolite]), and enhanced tissue amino acid use (e.g., drops in amino acids; modest increase in urea). A novel observation was that exercise significantly increased several xenometabolites ("non-self" molecules, from microbes or foods), including benzoic acid/salicylic acid/salicylaldehyde, hexadecanol/octadecanol/dodecanol, and chlorogenic acid. In addition, many non-annotated metabolites changed with exercise. Although exercise itself strongly impacted the global metabolome, there were surprisingly few intervention-associated differences despite marked improvements in  sensitivity, fitness, and adiposity. These results, and previously-reported plasma acylcarnitine profiles, support the principle that most metabolic changes during sub-maximal aerobic exercise are closely tethered to absolute ATP turnover rate (workload), regardless of fitness or metabolic health status.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600603>Incidence of Diabetes Mellitus in Male Moderate Alcohol Drinkers: A Community-Based Prospective Cohort Study.</a></h1><p>Although alcohol consumption is known to affect the incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM), reports on the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on DM incidence have been inconsistent. This community-based prospective cohort study was performed to investigate the incidence of DM in male Korean moderate alcohol drinkers.The Ansan and Ansung cohort was used for the analysis. The study population included a total of 3,492 men with no history of DM. The subjects were classified as mild (1-14 g/d), moderate (15-29 g/d), and heavy (≥30 g/d) drinkers based on their amount of alcohol consumption. The incidence rates of DM in the three groups were compared and analyzed over a 10 year follow-up period.The hazard ratios (HRs) for DM incidence were 25.12 (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.73-28.90) per 1,000 person years (PY) in mild drinkers, 31.13 (26.11-36.83) per 1,000 PY in moderate drinkers, and 31.68 (26.81-37.18) per 1,000 PY in heavy drinkers (p for trend, p = 0.043). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the HRs (95% CI) for DM were 1.25 (0.97-1.61, p = 0.086) in moderate drinkers and 1.30 (1.01-1.68, p = 0.045) in heavy drinkers compared to mild drinkers. The changes in pancreatic  secretion were more remarkable than those in  in all three groups.The incidence of DM in male Korean moderate drinkers did not increase significantly over the observation period. However, the incidence of DM tended to increase with increasing alcohol consumption. Pancreatic  secretion may play a more important role than  in the relationship between alcohol and incidence of DM.Copyright © 2019 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, the effects of S1P on the proliferation and apoptosis of β-cells in type 2 diabetic mice were investigated. The mice were administered intraperitoneal S1P solution daily at a dose of 20 µg/kg for three weeks. The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) and homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) index determination were carried out. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the protein expression of , antigen Ki-67 and S1P receptor isoforms (S1PR1/S1PR2/S1PR3) in pancreatic islets. Compared with the diabetic control (DC) group, the IPGTT results and HOMA-IR index in the S1P treatment group were decreased. The islets in the S1P group exhibited higher  immunostaining intensity than the DC group, as well as higher proliferation (P<0.05) and lower apoptosis rates (P<0.05). Positive staining for the S1P receptors S1PR1, S1PR2 and S1PR3 was observed in the cytoplasm and membrane of the islet cells. S1PR1 and S1PR2 proteins showed increased expression in the S1P and DC groups compared with the normal control group (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively), whereas no significant difference was observed in the expression of S1PR3 among these groups. In conclusion, extracellular S1P can induce islet β-cell proliferation and decrease cell apoptosis in diabetic mice. S1P function may be mediated via S1PR1 and S1PR2; therefore, targeting S1P/S1PR signalling pathways may be a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes mellitus.Copyright: © He et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571530>A thyroid hormone-independent molecular fingerprint of 3,-diiodothyronine suggests a strong relation with coffee metabolism in humans.</a></h1><p>In numerous studies based predominantly on rodent models, administration of 3,-diiodo-L-thyronine (3,-T2), a metabolite of the thyroid hormones (TH) thyroxine (T4) and triiodo-L-thyronine (T3), was reported to cause beneficial health effects including reversal of steatohepatosis and prevention of , in most instances without adverse thyrotoxic side effects. However, the empirical evidence concerning the physiological relevance of endogenously produced 3,-T2 in humans is comparatively poor. Therefore, to improve the understanding of 3,-T2 related metabolic processes, we performed a comprehensive metabolomics study relating serum 3,-T2 concentrations to plasma- and urine metabolite levels within a large general population sample. Serum 3,-T2 concentrations were determined for 856 participants of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania-TREND (SHIP-TREND). Plasma and urine metabolome data were generated using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, allowing quantification of 613 and 578 metabolites in plasma and urine, respectively. To detect thyroid function-independent significant 3,-T2 - metabolite associations, linear regression analyses controlling for major confounders including thyrotropin (TSH) and free T4 were performed. The same analyses were carried out using a sample of 16 male healthy volunteers treated for eight weeks with 250 µg/day levothyroxine to induce thyrotoxicosis. The specific molecular fingerprint of 3,-T2 comprised 15 and 73 significantly associated metabolites in plasma and urine, respectively. Serum 3,-T2 concentrations were neither associated with classical thyroid function parameters nor altered during experimental thyrotoxicosis. Strikingly, many metabolites related to coffee metabolism including caffeine and paraxanthine formed the clearest positively associated molecular signature. Importantly, these associations were replicated in the experimental human thyrotoxicosis model. The molecular fingerprint of 3,-T2 demonstrates a clear and strong positive association of the serum levels of this TH metabolite with plasma levels of compounds indicating coffee consumption, therefore pointing to the liver as an organ the metabolism of which is strongly affected by coffee. Furthermore, 3,-T2 serum concentrations were found not to be directly TH-dependent. Considering the beneficial health effects of 3,-T2 administration observed in animal models and those of coffee consumption demonstrated in large epidemiological studies, one might speculate that coffee-stimulated hepatic 3,-T2 production or accumulation represents an important molecular link in this connection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505716>[Association of  with dyslipidemia in adults with type 1 diabetes].</a></h1><p> To investigate the relationship between  (IR) and dyslipidemia in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and provide more insights on diabetes-related cardiovascular disease management.

Patients with eGDR lower than 25 percentiles were grouped as severe IR, otherwise non-severe IR.  In total, 499 eligible patients were studied, among which 274 were women (54.9%). The level of eGDR was 8.43 (6.11, 10.63) mg kg(-1) min(-1) and the overall incidence of lipid disorders was 65.3% (326/499) in the study population. The result showed that eGDR was correlated with TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C (-0.163, -0.303, 0.170 and -0.150, respectively, all 0.05). After adjusting for gender, age and diabetes duration, eGDR was still associated with TG, TC and LDL-C (all 0.05). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that gender (female), elevated TC and declined HDL-C were independent factors associated with the severity of IR (.651, .823 and 2.908, respectively, all 0.05).

Thirty European Caucasian adult participants were included in the study (17 men and 13 women). Body composition (body fat and lean body mass) was determined using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Concentrations of peptides in serum were assessed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Women had higher level of leptin (P < 0.001), with no other differences for analyzed peptides. We have found a significant correlation between serum concentrations of CART and NPY (P < 0.001). Fasting leptin level was associated with age (P = 0.002), waist circumference (P < 0.001), and lean body mass (P < 0.001). Levels of ghrelin were lower in participants with dyslipidemia (P = 0.009). Levels of obestatin (P = 0.008) and leptin (P = 0.02) were higher in participants with . Associations between body fat and appetite-regulating peptides are more complex than simple feedback loops. Leptin is probably the first signal in the pathway that regulates body fat content, as of all analyzed peptides leptin was the only one that was associated with body composition or anthropometric measurements.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527400>Somatotropic Axis and Obesity: Is There Any Role for the Mediterranean Diet?</a></h1><p>Obesity is associated with reduced spontaneous and stimulated growth hormone (GH) secretion and basal -like growth factor I (IGF-1) levels-which in turn is associated with increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this study was to investigate: (1) the association of somatotropic axis with cardiometabolic status; (2) the association of somatotropic axis with the Mediterranean diet and nutritional pattern in people with obesity. Cross-sectional observational study was carried out in 200 adult women, aged 36.98 ± 11.10 years with severe obesity (body mass index-BMI of 45.19 ± 6.30 kg/m). The adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the total calorie intake was assessed. Anthropometric measurements, body composition and biochemical profile were determined along with Growth Hormone (GH)/ like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) axis and  (homeostatic model assessment for -HoMA-IR). The enrolled subjects were compared after being divided according to GH peak response and according to IGF-1 standard deviation scores (SDS). Derangements of GH peak were detected in 61.% of studied patients while IGF-1 deficiency was detected in 71% of the population. Both blunted GH peak response and IGF-1 SDS were indicators of derangements of somatotropic axis and were associated with comparable results in terms of cardiometabolic sequelae. Both GH peak and IGF-1 levels were inversely associated with anthropometric and metabolic parameters. The adherence to the Mediterranean diet predicts GH peak response. Fatty liver index (FLI), fat mass (FM) and phase angle (PhA) were predictive factors of GH peak response as well. In conclusion derangements of somatotropic axis is associated with a worse cardiometabolic profile in people with obesity. A high adherence to the Mediterranean diet-and in particular protein intake-was associated with a better GH status.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663775>Exposure to Bisphenol A and Bisphenol S and Incident Type 2 Diabetes: A Case-Cohort Study in the French Cohort D.E.S.I.R.</a></h1><p>The question of whether exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes is still unresolved. Most epidemiological evidence on the association between BPA and diabetes is from cross-sectional studies or longitudinal studies with single urinary measurements. No prospective study has examined exposure to BPA analogs such as bisphenol S (BPS) in relation to incident type 2 diabetes.We aimed to investigate whether exposure to BPA and BPS, assessed at up to two time points, was associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes.We performed a case-cohort study on 755 participants without diabetes at baseline and followed-up over 9 y as part of the French prospective cohort Data from an Epidemiological Study on the  Syndrome (D.E.S.I.R.). BPA-glucuronide (BPA-G) and BPS-glucuronide (BPS-G) were assessed in fasting spot urine samples collected during the health examinations at baseline and 3 y later. Associations with incident diabetes were examined using Prentice-weighted Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders.A total of 201 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were diagnosed over the follow-up, including 30 in the subcohort. Compared with participants with the lowest average BPA exposure (below the first quartile), participants in the second, third, and fourth quartile groups of exposure had a near doubling of the risk of type 2 diabetes, with a hazard ratio  2.56 (95% CI: 1.16, .65), 2.35 (95% CI: 1.07, .15), and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.68, 3.55), respectively. The detection of BPS-G in urine at one or both time points was associated with incident diabetes, with an  2.81 (95% CI: 1.74, 4.53).This study shows positive associations between exposure to BPA and BPS and the incidence of type 2 diabetes, independent of traditional diabetes risk factors. Our results should be confirmed by recent, population-based observational studies in different populations and settings. Overall, these findings raise concerns about using BPS as a BPA substitute. Further research on BPA analogs is warranted. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5159.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535207>Association between body size-metabolic phenotype and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and significant fibrosis.</a></h1><p>Body size-metabolic phenotype may help predict whether or not individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) develop advanced liver disease. We studied the association of body size-metabolic phenotype with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and significant fibrosis.Our cross-sectional study included 559 subjects (mean age of 53 years; women 51%) with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Clinical, genetic, and histological characteristic features of NAFLD were evaluated. The metabolically unhealthy phenotype was defined by the presence of two or more metabolic components, while body size was categorized based on body mass index: obese (≥ 25 kg/m) or non-obese (< 25 kg/m). Body size-metabolic phenotypes were divided into four study groups: (1) non-obese metabolic syndrome (MS)-, (2) non-obese MS+ , (3) obese MS-, and (4) obese MS+.Obese MS- and non-obese MS+ groups demonstrated comparable levels of , adipose tissue  indexes, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) areas. The VAT area was significantly higher in the obese MS+ group versus obese MS- group. However, the VAT to subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) ratio was highest in the non-obese MS+ group. There was no difference in histology between the non-obese MS+, obese MS-, and obese MS+ groups. Multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and VAT/SAT areas demonstrated an independent and dose-dependent relationship between the body size-metabolic phenotype and NASH or significant fibrosis.The non-obese MS+ group displayed similar degree of hepatic histological severity compared to their obese MS- counterparts.

We investigated the effects of a late-evening snack (LES) with branched-chain amino acid-enriched nutrients (BCAA-EN) on glucose metabolism in cirrhosis patients. LES with BCAA-EN was administered for 1 week in 13 patients with cirrhosis and hypoalbuminemia. Blood glucose (BG) levels were measured every 15 min. The patients were divided into two groups based on BG levels: group 1 (G1,  = 11): nocturnal BG levels <200 mg/dL and group 2 (G2,  = 2): nocturnal BG levels ≥200 mg/dL. G1 had nocturnal BG levels <200 mg/dL, whereas G2 had nocturnal BG levels ≥200 mg/dL. The average BG levels did not significantly change after BCAA-EN administration in G1 (before 91.9 ± 29.0 mg/dL; after 89.0 ± 24.3 mg/dl). However, the average BG levels significantly increased after BCAA-EN administration in G2 (before 153.6 ± 43.3 mg/dL; after 200.9 ± 59.7 mg/dL) ( < 0.01). The glycated albumin level (16.6 ± 0.9% vs. 16.2 ± 2.1%), fasting immunoreactive  (F-IRI) level (53.9 ± 34.0 μU/mL vs. 16. ± 11.0 μU/mL), and homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) score (17.85 ± 10.58 vs. 4.02 ± 2.59) were significantly higher in G2 than in G1 ( < 0.05,  < 0.05, and  < 0.01, respectively). The quantitative  sensitivity check indices (0.32 ± 0.03 vs. 0.27 ± 0.02) were significantly higher in G1 than in G2 ( < 0.01). One patient in G2 was obese and had type 2 diabetes. The other patient was obese and had a high HOMA-IR score and F-IRI level. A LES with BCAA-EN does not inhibit overt diabetes in most cirrhosis patients.

Patients with no CVRF were considered metabolically healthy (MHO).  The percentage of MHO patients was 59.8% in G1 while was consistently around 30% in the other groups. WC was more frequently abnormal in G2 males. Pubertal progression was associated with a decrease in WC abnormalities. SP was more frequently abnormal in G4 males and pubertal progression was associated with higher prevalence of abnormal SP in males. Pubertal progression was associated with an increase in hypertension rate in both sexes. HOMA was more frequently abnormal in G2 and G3 females. HDL, LDL, and TG were more frequently abnormal in G2 females. Dyslipidemia rate was higher in G2 females. Pubertal progression was associated with higher prevalence of abnormal HDL in males.  Sex and pubertal status influence the frequency of abnormalities of CVRF in obese children and adolescents. CVRF are already present in prepubertal age.

This study evaluated the effects of a chemically characterized OLE in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice, describing the underlying mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects, with special attention to vascular dysfunction and gut microbiota composition.C57BL/6J mice were distributed in different groups: control, control-treated, obese and obese-treated with OLE (1, 10 and 25 mg/kg/day). Control mice received a standard diet, whereas obese mice were fed HFD. The treatment was followed for  weeks, and animal body weight periodically assessed. At the end of the treatment, metabolic plasma analysis (including lipid profile) as well as glucose and  levels were performed. The HFD-induced inflammatory status was studied in liver and fat, by determining the RNA expression of different inflammatory mediators by qPCR; also, different markers of intestinal epithelial barrier function were determined in colonic tissue by qPCR. Additionally, flow cytometry of immune cells from adipose tissue, endothelial dysfunction in aortic rings as well as gut microbiota composition were evaluated. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to antibiotic-treated mice fed with HFD was performed.OLE administration reduced body weight gain, basal glycaemia and , and showed improvement in plasma lipid profile when compared with HFD-fed mice. The extract significantly ameliorated the HFD-induced altered expression of key adipogenic genes, like PPARs, adiponectin and leptin receptor, in adipose tissue. Furthermore, the extract reduced the RNA expression of Tnf-α, Il-1β, Il-6 in liver and adipose tissue, thus improving the tissue inflammatory status associated to obesity. The flow cytometry analysis in adipose tissue corroborated these observations. Additionally, the characterization of the colonic microbiota by sequencing showed that OLE administration was able to counteract the dysbiosis associated to obesity. The extract reversed the endothelial dysfunction observed in the aortic rings of obese mice. FMT from donors HFD-OLE to recipient mice fed an HFD prevented the development of obesity, glucose intolerance,  and endothelial dysfunction.OLE exerts beneficial effects in HFD-induced obesity in mice, which was associated to an improvement in plasma and tissue metabolic profile, inflammatory status, gut microbiota composition and vascular dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and -mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed -fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of  (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and  signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and , which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

During cardiac surgery, the administration of high-dose  along with dextrose titration maintains normoglycemia, but dramatically decreases plasma amino acids (AAs) compared with preoperative fasting levels. Hypoaminoacidemia limits protein synthesis and prevents anabolic responses after surgery. We investigated whether parenteral infusion of AAs during and immediately after cardiac surgery would prevent hypoaminoacidemia in patients who receive high-dose  therapy.Sixteen patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery were randomly allocated to receive AAs with % kcal equivalent to either 20% (n = 8) or 35% (n = 8) of their measured resting energy expenditure (REE).  was infused at a constant rate of  mU/(kg × min), whereas dextrose was titrated to maintain normoglycemia during and until  h after surgery. Plasma AA concentrations were measured at baseline before and after surgery.Compared with the 20% AA group after surgery, AA concentrations were significantly higher in the 35% AA group for 12 of 20 AAs (P < 0.032), including all branched-chain AAs. In the 20% AA group, total essential AAs decreased by 21% and nonessential AAs decreased by 14% after surgery compared with preoperative fasting levels. In contrast, giving 35% AAs prevented this unfavorable decrease in AAs, and in fact allowed for a 23% and 12% increase in essential and nonessential AAs, respectively.AA supplementation at 35% REE, but not 20% REE, can effectively prevent hypoaminoacidemia caused by high-dose  therapy during cardiac surgery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In MEDLINE and Embase, we identified and reviewed 49 relevant RCTs: 30 had appropriate data format for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Using the Review Manager  software, we calculated the pooled standardized mean differences comparing dairy dietary interventions to control for our outcomes of interest. For HOMA-IR (794 individuals), we found a mean difference of -1.21 (95% CI -1.74 to -0.67; -value < 0.00001;  = 92%). For waist circumference (1348 individuals), the mean difference was -1.09 cm (95% CI 1.68 to -0.58; -value < 0.00001;  = 94%). For body weight (2362 individuals), the dairy intake intervention group weighed 0.42 kg less than control (-value < 0.00001;  = 92%).

Since mitochondria are a major source of ROS, it is vital to understand the involvement of these organelles in the pathogenesis of ROS-mediated conditions. Therefore, we investigated mitochondrial function and ROS production in cerebral blood vessels of 21-wk-old Zucker diabetic fatty obese rats and their lean controls. We have previously shown that in the early stages of , and short periods of type 2 diabetes mellitus, only mild differences exist in mitochondrial function. In the present study, we examined mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial protein expression, and ROS production in large-surface cerebral arteries. We used 21-wk-old animals exposed to peak glucose levels for 7 wk and compared them with our previous studies on younger diabetic animals. We found that the same segments of mitochondrial respiration (basal respiration and proton leak) were diminished in diabetic groups as they were in younger diabetic animals. Levels of rattin, a rat humanin analog, tended to decrease in the diabetic group but did not reach statistical significance ( = 0.08). Other mitochondrial proteins were unaffected, which might indicate the existence of compensatory mechanisms with extension of this relatively mild form of diabetes. Superoxide levels were significantly higher in large cerebral vessels of diabetic animals compared with the control group. In conclusion, prolonged dietary diabetes leads to stabilization, rather than deterioration, of metabolic status in the cerebral circulation, despite continued overproduction of ROS. We have characterized for the first time the dynamics of mitochondrial function during the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus with regard to mitochondrial respiration, protein expression, and reactive oxygen species production. In addition, this is the first measurement of rattin levels in the cerebral vasculature, which could potentially lead to novel treatment options.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662903>Are Nonnutritive Sweeteners Obesogenic?

The study explored changes in the faecal microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) associated with the diet (including nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs)) and evaluated metabolic consequences in subjects with morbid obesity. The diet was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. One unit of NNSs was 100 mL beverage with NNSs or 2 tablets/teaspoons of NNSs. The faecal microbiota was assessed with GA-map® dysbiosis test and SCFA with gas chromatography and flame ionisation detection. Fourteen men and 75 women with a mean age of 44.6 (SD 8.7) years, BMI 41.8 (SD 3.6) kg/m, and intake of NNSs 7. units/day (SD 3.2; range 0-43) were included. Faecal butyric acid was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric acid has antiobesogenic effects, reduces , and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the weight-reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose weight is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric acid.Copyright © 2019 Per G.

The aim of this study was to establish how reliable this strategy is to predict changes in liver histology in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Patients with NASH who had participated in our prior randomized controlled trials of pioglitazone with complete paired data for IHTG content by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liver histology were included in the study.A total of 121 patients were included. Changes in IHTG were assessed in several ways: as a continuous variable (correlations), as categorical groups (IHTG change ≥0%; or IHTG reduction of 1-30%; 31-50%; 51-70%; or >70%), and in a binomial way as steatosis resolution or not (defined as achieving IHTG <.56%). Changes in IHTG correlated with steatosis on histology (r = 0.54; p <0.01). However, the magnitude of IHTG reduction was not associated with the rate of response of the primary histological outcome (2-point improvement in the NAFLD activity score from 2 different parameters, without worsening of fibrosis) or resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis, neither in patients receiving pioglitazone nor placebo. Changes in lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, or liver fibrosis were also independent of changes in IHTG, irrespective of treatment arm. Steatosis resolution was not associated with better histological outcomes either.Changes in IHTG predict changes in steatosis but not of other liver histological parameters. This implies that IHTG response to treatment should be interpreted with caution, as it may not be as reliable as previously believed to predict a treatment's overall clinical efficacy in patients with NASH.Quantification of liver fat by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently used to assess treatment responses in patients with fatty liver, with the assumption that improvements in liver fat translate into less inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis in the liver. However, in this article, we showed that changes in liver fat do not necessarily translate into changes in these parameters.

However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia, browning is thought to contribute to energy wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and -aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and browning, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the browning of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular energy sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose browning.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We thus generated fatty acid-binding protein 4 (Fabp4)-GDF5 transgenic (TG) mice and showed that GDF5 TG mice developed a relative lean phenotype on a high-fat diet (HFD) and showed increased  sensitivity. Over expression of GDF5 in adipose tissues greatly promoted the thermogenic process in sWAT after cold or β3-agonist treatment. In TG mice, sWAT showed an important thermogenic effect as the thermogenic gene expression was markedly increased, which was consistent with the typical features of beige adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of the protein GDF5 impaired browning program in sWAT after thermogenic stimuli. Enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) signaling was also identified in sWAT of HFD-fed GDF5 mice, and thermogenesis in mature adipocytes induced by GDF5 protein could be partly blocked by a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Taken together, our data suggest that GDF5 could improve  sensitivity and prevent metabolic syndrome, the adaptive thermogenesis in sWAT could mediate the obesity  effects of GDF5 in mice and partially resulted in the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541144>A Cross-Sectional Study on the Dietary Pattern Impact on Cardiovascular Disease Biomarkers in Malaysia.</a></h1><p>We conducted this cross-sectional population study with a healthy multi-ethnic urban population (n = 577) in Malaysia, combining nutritional assessments with cardiometabolic biomarkers defined by lipid, atherogenic lipoproteins, inflammation and . We found diametrically opposing associations of carbohydrate (246·6 ± 57·7 g, 54·3 ± 6·%-TEI) and fat (total = 64· ± 19·8 g, 31·6 ± ·%-TEI; saturated fat = 14·1 ± 2·7%-TEI) intakes as regards waist circumference, HDL-C, blood pressure, glucose,  and HOMA2-IR as well as the large-LDL and large-HDL lipoprotein particles. Diets were then differentiated into either low fat (LF, <30% TEI or <50 g) or high fat (HF, >35% TEI or >70 g) and low carbohydrate (LC, <210 g) or high carbohydrate (HC, >285 g) which yielded LFLC, LFHC, HFLC and HFHC groupings. Cardiometabolic biomarkers were not significantly different (P > 0.05) between LFLC and HFLC groups. LFLC had significantly higher large-LDL particle concentrations compared to HFHC. HOMA-IR2 was significantly higher with HFHC (1·91 ± 1·85, P < 0·001) versus other fat-carbohydrate combinations (LFLC = 1·34 ± 1·07, HFLC = 1·41 ± 1·07; LFHC = 1·31 ± 0·93). After co-variate adjustment, odds of having HOMA2-IR >1.7 in the HFHC group was 2.43 (95% CI: 1·03, ·72) times more compared to LFLC while odds of having large-LDL <450 nmol/L in the HFHC group was 1.91 (95% CI: 1·06, 3·44) more compared to latter group.

Ghrelin or saline was infused intravenously (1 pmol/min x kg) after collection of baseline sample (0 min), and blood was subsequently collected at time 30, 60, 90, and 120 min.Mouse small intestine was perfused (n= 6) and GLP-1 output from perfused mouse small intestine was investigated in response to vascular ghrelin administration in the presence and absence of a simultaneous luminal glucose stimulus. Ghrelin receptor expression was quantified in human (n=11) and mouse L-cells (n=3) by RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR, respectively.Ghrelin did not affect GLP-1 secretion in humans [AUC(0-120 min): ghrelin infusion=1.37±0.05 min x nmol vs. saline infusion=1.40±0.06 min x nmol (P = 0.63)], but induced peripheral . Likewise, ghrelin did not stimulate GLP-1 in the perfused mouse small intestine model (mean outputs during baseline/ghrelin infusion = 19.3±1.6/25.±2.0 fmol/min, n=6, P=0.16), whereas glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide administration, used as a positive control, doubled GLP-1 secretion (P<0.001). Intra-luminal glucose increased GLP-1 secretion by 4-fold (P<0.001) which was not potentiated by ghrelin. Finally, gene expression of the ghrelin receptor was undetectable in mouse L-cells and marginal in human L-cells.Ghrelin does not interact directly with the L-cell and does not directly affect GLP-1 secretion.© Endocrine Society 2019.

According to reactivity hypothesis, sympathetic response to stressors may be more sensitive at predicting IR than baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), a baseline measure of baroreflex functioning. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of negative affect coupled with minute-to-minute HR and heart-rate variability (HRV) monitoring, we examined whether negative affect (NA)-related autonomic arousal mediates the association of BRS with IR. At baseline, BRS was measured, and fasting serum glucose and  levels were collected from 178 young adults (18-39 years old), from which homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell functioning (HOMA %B) were derived. Participants subsequently underwent one day of Holter HR and HRV monitoring while reporting negative affect levels  EMA. Multilevel modeling was used to assess the associations of momentary negative affect with HR and low- (LF) and high-frequency (HF) HRV during the -minute intervals following each EMA reading. Structural equation modeling was then used to determine whether individual differences in these associations mediated the association of BRS with IR, measured by HOMA-IR, HOMA %B, and  levels. As predicted, BRS was negatively associated with the IR ( = -.17,  = .024). However, NA-related autonomic arousal mediated their association, accounting for 56% of the covariance between BRS and IR. Not only do these results provide support for reactivity hypothesis, they reveal a potential point of intervention in the treatment of affective dysregulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569345>The Association between Adult Weight Gain and  at Middle Age: Mediation by Visceral Fat and Liver Fat.</a></h1><p>We aimed to investigate the role of the amount of visceral fat and liver fat in the association between adult weight change and  at middle age. In the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study, adult weight change was calculated with recalled body weight at age 20 years and measured body weight at middle age. Measures of  were calculated using both fasting and postprandial glucose and  concentrations. Visceral fat was assessed by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and liver fat by proton-MR spectroscopy ( = 1758). We examined the association between adult weight change and  with linear regression, adjusted for confounding factors. To investigate mediation, we additionally adjusted for total body fat, visceral fat, and liver fat. In participants who gained ≥50% of body weight during adulthood, homeostatic model assessment for  (HOMA-IR) was 3.22 (95% CI 2.76; 3.77) times higher than in weight maintainers. In a joint model, total body fat mediated this association for 8.1% (95% CI -9.2; 25.4), visceral fat for 32.0% (18.6; 45.4%) and liver fat for 22.% (15.0; 30.1).

To extend these findings, associations between perception of hunger and satiety with endocannabinoids, and with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and polypeptide YY (PYY) were assessed. At approximately 34 months after weight loss, 22 female and 16 male participants (mean age 64. ± .9 years; body mass index (BMI) 28.9 ± 3.9 kg/m) completed a 48 h respiration chamber study. Participants were fed in energy balance with a HP/MCHO diet with 25%:45%:30% or a moderate-protein/high-carbohydrate (MP/HCHO) diet with 15%:55%:30% of energy from protein:carbohydrate:fat. Endocannabinoids and related compounds, relevant postprandial hormones (GLP-1, PYY), hunger, satiety, and ad libitum food intake were assessed. HP/MCHO versus MP/HCHO reduced hunger perception. The lower decremental area under the curve (dAUC) for hunger in the HP/MCHO diet (-56.6% compared to MP,  < 0.05) was associated with the higher AUC for 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) concentrations ( < 0.05). Hunger was inversely associated with PYY in the HP/MCHO group (r = -0.7,  < 0.01). Ad libitum food intake, homeostatic model assessment for  (HOMA-IR) and incremental AUCs for gut peptides were not different between conditions. HP/MCHO versus MP/HCHO diet-induced reduction in hunger was present after 34 months weight maintenance in the post-obese state. HP/MCHO diet-induced decrease of hunger is suggested to interact with increased 2-AG and PYY concentrations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555655>Nutritional Strategies to Combat Type 2 Diabetes in Aging Adults: The Importance of Protein.</a></h1><p>The prevalence of pre-diabetes (PD) and type II diabetes (T2D) has risen dramatically in recent years affecting an estimated 422 million adults worldwide. The risk of T2D increases with age, with the sharpest rise in diagnosis occurring after age 40. With age, there is also a progressive decline in muscle mass starting after the age of 30. The decline in muscle mass and function due to aging is termed sarcopenia and immediately precedes the sharp rise in T2D. The purpose of the current review is to discuss the role of protein to attenuate declines in muscle mass and  sensitivity to prevent T2D and sarcopenia in aging adults. The current recommended dietary allowance for protein consumption is set at 0.8 g/kg/day and is based on dated studies on young healthy men and may not be sufficient for older adults. Protein consumption upwards of 1.0-1. g/kg/day in older adults is able to induce improvements in glycemic control and muscle mass. Obesity, particularly central or visceral obesity is a major risk factor in the development of PD and T2D. However, the tissue composition of weight loss in older adults includes both lean body mass and fat mass and therefore may have adverse metabolic consequences in older adults who are already at a high risk of lean body mass loss. High protein diets have the ability to increase weight loss while preserving lean body mass therefore inducing "high-quality weight loss," which provides favorable metabolic changes in older adults. High protein diets also induce beneficial outcomes on glycemic markers due to satiety, lowered post-prandial glucose response, increased thermogenesis, and the ability to decrease rates of muscle protein breakdown (MPB). The consumption of dairy specific protein consumption has also been shown to improve  sensitivity by improving body composition, enhancing  release, accelerating fat oxidation, and stimulating rates of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in older adults. Exercise, specifically  training, also works synergistically to attenuate the progression of PD and T2D by further stimulating rates of MPS thereby increasing muscle mass and inducing favorable changes in glycemic control independent of lean body mass increases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636376>The Iberian pig fed with high-fat diet: a model of renal disease in obesity and metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>The pathogenesis of renal disease in the context of overweight/obesity, metabolic syndrome, and  is not completely understood. This may be due to the lack of a definitive animal model of disease, which limits our understanding of obesity-induced renal damage. We evaluated the changes in renal histology and lipid deposits induced by obesity in a model of : the Iberian swine fed with fat-enriched food.Twenty-eight female sows were randomized to standard (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD: 6.8% of saturated fat) for 100 days. Weight, adiposity, analytics, oral glucose tolerance tests, and measured renal function were determined. Renal histology and lipid deposits in renal tissue were analyzed.Animals on HFD developed obesity, hypertension, high levels of LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, , and glomerular hyperfiltration. No animal developed overt diabetes. Animals on HFD showed "diabetoid changes", including mesangial expansion [21.40% ± 4 vs.13.20% ± 4.0, p < 0.0001], nodular glomerulosclerosis [7.40% ± 7, 0.75 vs. 2.40% ± 4.7, p = 0.02], and glomerulomegaly (18% vs. 10%, p = 0.010) than those on SD. Tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, inflammation, arteriolar hyalinosis, or fibrointimal thickening were mild and similar between groups. Triglyceride content in renal tissue was higher in animals on HFD than in SD (15.4% ± 0. vs. 12.7% ± 0.7; p < 0.01).Iberian pigs fed with fat-enriched food showed diabetoid changes and glomerulomegaly as observed in obese humans making this model suitable to study obesity-induced renal disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568675>Testosterone therapy induces molecular programming augmenting physiological adaptations to  exercise in older men.</a></h1><p>The andropause is associated with declines in serum testosterone (T), loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia), and frailty. Two major interventions purported to offset sarcopenia are anabolic steroid therapies and  exercise training (RET). Nonetheless, the efficacy and physiological and molecular impacts of T therapy adjuvant to short-term RET remain poorly defined.Eighteen non-hypogonadal healthy older men, 65-75 years, were assigned in a random double-blinded fashion to receive, biweekly, either placebo (P, saline, n = 9) or T (Sustanon 250 mg, n = 9) injections over 6 week whole-body RET (three sets of 8-10 repetitions at 80% one-repetition maximum). Subjects underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, ultrasound of vastus lateralis (VL) muscle architecture, and knee extensor isometric muscle force tests; VL muscle biopsies were taken to quantify myogenic/anabolic gene expression, anabolic signalling, muscle protein synthesis (D O), and breakdown (extrapolated).Testosterone adjuvant to RET augmented total fat-free mass (P=0.007), legs fat-free mass (P=0.02), and appendicular fat-free mass (P=0.001) gains while decreasing total fat mass (P=0.02). Augmentations in VL muscle thickness, fascicle length, and quadriceps cross-section area with RET occured to a greater extent in T (P < 0.05). Sum strength (P=0.0009) and maximal voluntary contract (e.g. knee extension at 70°) (P=0.002) increased significantly more in the T group. Mechanistically, both muscle protein synthesis rates (T: 2.13 ± 0.21%·day vs. P: 1.34 ± 0.13%·day , P=0.0009) and absolute breakdown rates (T: 140.2 ± 15.8 g·day vs. P: 90.2 ± 11.7 g·day , P=0.02) were elevated with T therapy, which led to higher net turnover and protein accretion in the T group (T: 8.3 ± 1.4 g·day vs. P: 1.9 ± 1.2 g·day , P=0.004). Increases in ribosomal biogenesis (RNA:DNA ratio); mRNA expression relating to T metabolism (androgen receptor: 1.4-fold; Srd5a1: 1.6-fold; AKR1C3: 2.1-fold; and HSD17β3: two-fold); -like growth factor (IGF)-1 signalling [IGF-1Ea (3.-fold) and IGF-1Ec (three-fold)] and myogenic regulatory factors; and the activity of anabolic signalling (e.g. mTOR, AKT, and RPS6; P < 0.05) were all up-regulated with T therapy. Only T up-regulated mitochondrial citrate synthase activity (P=0.03) and transcription factor A (1.41 ± 0.2-fold, P=0.0002), in addition to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1-α mRNA (1.19 ± 0.21-fold, P=0.037).Administration of T adjuvant to RET enhanced skeletal muscle mass and performance, while up-regulating myogenic gene programming, myocellular translational efficiency and capacity, collectively resulting in higher protein turnover, and net protein accretion. T coupled with RET is an effective short-term intervention to improve muscle mass/function in older non-hypogonadal men.© 2019 The Authors.

There is an urgent need for innovative approaches to overcome these limitations.We devised a structure-based chimerisation strategy in which we substituted the thermally labile and low receptor affinity core of FGF21 with an HS binding deficient endocrinised core derived from a stable and high receptor affinity paracrine FGF1 (FGF1). The thermal stability, receptor binding ability, heparan sulfate and βKlotho coreceptor dependency of the chimera were measured using a thermal shift assay, SPR, SEC-MALS and cell-based studies. The half-life, tissue distribution, glucose lowering activity and adipose tissue remodeling were analyzed in normal and diabetic mice and monkeys.The melting temperature of the engineered chimera (FGF1-FGF21) increased by ∼22 °C relative to wild-type FGF21 (FGF21), and resulted in a ∼-fold increase in half-life in vivo. The chimera also acquired an ability to bind the FGFR1c isoform - the principal receptor that mediates the metabolic actions of FGF21 - and consequently was dramatically more effective than FGF21 in correcting hyperglycemia and in ameliorating  in db/db mice. Our chimeric FGF21 also exerted a significant beneficial effect on glycemic control in spontaneous diabetic cynomolgus monkeys.Our study describes a structure-based chimerisation approach that effectively mitigates both the intrinsically weak receptor binding affinities and short half-lives of endocrine FGFs, and advance the development of the FGF21 hormone into a potentially useful drug for Type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

We investigated 11 lactating cows presumed to have SARA based on duration of ruminal pH <.6 and reticulum pH <6.3 in 2015-2016. Kraft pulp (KP) was used to supplement feed of 7 of the cows studied in an effort to reduce SARA. We continuously monitored ruminal pH and measured blood concentrations of hormones and metabolites related to energy metabolism. Blood measurements included glucose (GLU), total cholesterol (TC), free fatty acid (FFA), , adiponectin (ADN), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Additionally, we analyzed milk data (milk yield, milk fat percentage, milk protein percentage, milk urea nitrogen, and protein fat ratio) and reproduction data. The results demonstrated that ADN levels at 4 weeks post-parturition correlated with the total amount of time that the ruminal or reticulum fluid pH was under the threshold during 1 week post-parturition, as well as the numbers of days the cows were diagnosed with SARA (SARA-positive days) up to 30 days post-parturition. SARA-positive days in 2016 were higher than those in 2015. In both years, numbers of SARA-positive days for cows supplemented with KP were lower than those for cows without KP. Increased ADN levels may be a compensatory reaction to frequent SARA which modulates the inflammatory response against high LPS levels and improves  caused by LPS.

(1) Hb level during the first trimester of pregnancy in GDM group was significantly higher than that in control group [(123±10),(119±11) g/L, <0.05]. There were no significant difference in gravidity, parity, index of liver and renal function (all 0.05). (2) Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), 1-hour BG and 2-hour BG of OGTT were significantly increased in the high Hb level group during the first trimester of pregnancy, which were (23±4) kg/m(2), (7.3±2.0) mmol/L, and (6.±1.4) mmol/L (<0.05), respectively. The pre-pregnancy BMI, 1-hour BG and 2-hour BG of the normal or low Hb level group were (22±3) kg/m(2), (6.7±1.6) mmol/L, (6.1±1.2) mmol/L; (22±3) kg/m(2), (6.±1.) mmol/L, (.9±1.1) mmol/L, respectively. There were no statistically significant difference in levels of fasting blood glucose, fasting , HOMA-IR and HOMA-β within 3 groups (all 0.05). (3) In the high Hb level group, prevalence of pregnancy overweight or obesity and GDM were the highest, which were 37.2%(64/172) and 15.1%(26/172), respectively; the differences were statistically significant (all <0.05). (4) The serum Hb level in the first trimester was positively related with pre-pregnancy BMI (=0.130, <0.05), 1-hour BG (=0.129, <0.05), 2-hour BG (=0.134, <0.05), fasting  (=0.096, <0.05), and HOMA-IR (=0.101, <0.05).Logistic regression indicated that Hb≥130 g/L during the first trimester of pregnancy was an independent risk factor for GDM (=2.799, 95%: 1.186-6.604; <0.05).  The high level of Hb (Hb≥130 g/L) during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with GDM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542165>Prevalence of  in Korean women with polycystic ovary syndrome according to various homeostasis model assessment for  cutoff values.</a></h1><p>To investigate the various homeostasis model assessment for  (HOMA-IR) cutoff values in a large population of healthy controls and to evaluate the prevalence of IR in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Case control study.Reproductive endocrinology center.Women with (n = 699) and without PCOS (n = 572).Blood tests.The upper 75th and 95th percentiles of HOMA-IR in lean controls (n = 522) and the HOMA-IR cutoff that indicates metabolic risk in all participants.HOMA-IR cutoffs of 1.82 and 3.16 were defined as above the 75th and 95th percentiles in lean controls, and the prevalence of IR in patients with PCOS was 60.7% and 24.%, respectively. The optimal HOMA-IR for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was 2.64; thus, metabolic risk was increased at a lower level of HOMA-IR compared with the 95th percentile cutoff. At HOMA-IR cutoff of 2.64, 34.8% of patients with PCOS had evidence of IR. Metabolic features significantly differed between patients with PCOS with and without IR, and patients with PCOS without IR showed similar or more favorable metabolic features compared with controls. Overweight/obese patients are the most high-risk group, but lean patients also showed a similarly elevated prevalence of IR as overweight/obese controls. A positive correlation was observed between BMI and HOMA-IR in both patients and controls, but the magnitude was significantly greater in patients than in controls.Although IR is common in women with PCOS, it does not seem to be universal, and patients without IR had reassuring metabolic features.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients have multiple comorbidities and many metabolic disorders, causing the frequent occurrence of metabolic syndrome. The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence of MetS in HD patients, and its association with all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. : A total of 138 HD patients were included in this prospective study. We analyzed demographic, anthropometric and biochemical data. Outcome measures were all-cause and CV mortality during the three-year follow-up. : MetS was diagnosed in 57.24% of enrolled patients. During the 36 months of follow-up, 33 patients died. MetS patients showed a significantly higher mortality rate than non-MetS (30.4% versus 16.36%,  < 0.001). The association of different MetS components with cardiovascular mortality reached significance when a minimum of three components were present (1.81 (95% confidence interval CI = 1.21-2.33)), with a grouped increase in effect size for subjects with four or five MetS components. Subjects with MetS exhibited nearly twice as high risk for all-cause (hazard ratio HR = 1.99 (95%CI) = 1.42-2.97) and 2. times for CV (HR = 2.51 (95%CI) = 1.25-3.83) mortality compared with those without MetS, after adjustment for age, gender, and cardiovascular disease.  The study demonstrates that MetS is widespread in HD patients. In future, the focus must be on an active screening approach, and treatment of cardiometabolic risk factors, aiming to reduce mortality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607907>Butyrate Improves the Metabolic Disorder and Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis in Mice Induced by a High-Fat Diet.</a></h1><p> Metabolic syndrome (MS) is one of the major causes of coronary artery diseases (CAD). Gut microbiome diversity and its natural fermentation products are not only correlated with MS and CAD, but their correlations also appear to be stronger than the associations with traditional risk factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a new potential pathway for the natural fermentation product butyrate to improve MS and to examine whether it is associated with serum metabolic profiles and gut flora composition.  C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with 400 mg/kg of sodium butyrate for 16 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected, and the metabolite concentrations and 16s rRNA were measured with liquid chromatography-MS and Illumina platform, respectively. The plasma differential metabolites and gut microbiome composition were analyzed with XCMS online and QIIME 2, respectively.  Gut microbiome-derived butyrate reduced glucose intolerance and , resisting HFD-induced increase in the relative abundance of f_, f_, and f_. Meanwhile, sodium butyrate increased the levels of α-linolenate, all-trans-retinal, resolvin E1, and leukotriene in the plasma, and the differential pathways showed enrichment in mainly resolvin E biosynthesis, histidine degradation, lipoxin biosynthesis, and leukotriene biosynthesis. Moreover, sodium butyrate increased the levels of phosphorylated-adenosine '-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and facilitated glucose transporter member 4 (GLUT4) in the adipose tissue.  Butyrate can induce AMPK activation and GLUT4 expression in the adipose tissue, improving cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related metabolic disorder, resisting HFD-induced gut microbiome dysbiosis, and promoting resolvin E1 and lipoxin biosynthesis. Oral supplement of the natural fermentation product butyrate can be a potential strategy for preventing CVD.Copyright © 2019 Gao, Lv, Long, Chen, He, Ruan and Zhu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508332>The effects of natural nano-sized clinoptilolite and  supplementation on serum bone markers in diabetic rats.</a></h1><p> Many studies confirm that diabetes mellitus is associated with higher risks of bone fracture. The beneficial effects of  (NS) and clinoptilolite in preventing/reducing some diabetes-related disorders have been shown. This study was conducted to examine the effects of separate and concurrent supplementation of natural nano-sized clinoptilolite (NCLN) and NS on serum bone markers in rats with type 2 diabetes.  A total of 42 (case=36 and control=6) adult male Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups: diabetic and non-diabetic. An oral glucose tolerance test and a homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) test were conducted to confirm diabetes. Then, the diabetic group was divided into 4 subgroups: [1] control (n=9), [2] NS 1%/food (n=9), [3] NCLN 2%/food (n=9), [4] NS 1%/food + NCLN 2%/food (n=9). After 7 weeks, serum levels of bone markers were determined using ELISA kits.  Analysis showed that serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the NCLN group (1318.6 ± 217. U/L) was significantly (<0.05) higher than other intervented groups. On the other hand, serum levels of calcium in NCLN+NS group (10.8 ± 2.6 mg/dL) were higher (=0.027) compared to all other study groups. However, rats in the NS group had higher (535.8 ± 49.3 pg/mL) PTH (<0.0001) compared to other supplementation groups. There were no significant differences in vitamin D and osteoprotegerin.  The results of the current study suggest that bone mineralization may be affected by concurrent use of NS and NCLN through influencing calcium circulation. Moreover, dietary NS administration is strongly related to an augmented level of PTH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623319>A Proteomics-Based Approach Reveals Differential Regulation of Urine Proteins between Metabolically Healthy and Unhealthy Obese Patients.</a></h1><p>Metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity threatens to inundate health care resources by increasing the incidences of obesity-related diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in the urinary proteome of 18 individuals classified into metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUHO) patients. Proteome analysis was performed using the two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). Upon analysis, a total of 54 proteins were found to be affected with ≥1.-fold change (ANOVA,  ≤ 0.05), of which 44 proteins were upregulated and 10 proteins were downregulated. These differentially abundant proteins were related to nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways and were involved in cellular compromise, inflammatory response, and cancer. Proteins involved in inflammation (fibrinogen alpha (FIBA), serotransferrin (TRFE, and kininogen-1 (KNG1)) and  (ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-like protein 15 (ARL15) and retinol-binding protein 4 (RET4)) were found to be significantly increased in the urine samples of MUHO compared to MHO patients.

Random-effects models meta-analysis was used. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach assessed the strength of evidence.Of 15 prospective cohorts (23 publications), 4 found highest compared with lowest habitual intakes of flavan-3-ols were associated with a 13% reduction in risk of CVD mortality and 2 found a 19% reduction in risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) incidence. Highest compared with lowest habitual intakes of monomers were associated with a reduction in risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n = ) and stroke (n = 4) (10% and 18%, respectively). No association was found for hypertension. Of 156 RCTs, flavan-3-ol intervention resulted in significant improvements in acute/chronic flow-mediated dilation (FMD), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol (TC), LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR). All analyses, except HbA1c, were associated with moderate/high heterogeneity. When analyses were limited to good methodological quality studies, improvements in TC, HDL cholesterol, SBP, DBP, HOMA-IR, and acute/chronic FMD remained significant. In GRADE evaluations, there was moderate evidence in cohort studies that flavan-3-ol and monomer intakes were associated with reduced risk of CVD mortality, CHD, stroke, and T2DM, whereas RCTs reported improved TC, HDL cholesterol, SBP, and HOMA-IR.Available evidence supports a beneficial effect of flavan-3-ol intake on cardiometabolic outcomes, but there was considerable heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. Future research should focus on an integrated intake/biomarker approach in cohorts and high-quality dose-response RCTs.

In women with PCOS, effective ovulation induction serves as an important first-line treatment for anovulatory infertility. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis is considered as the gold standard for evidence synthesis which provides accurate assessments of outcomes from primary randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and allows additional analyses for time-to-event outcomes. It also facilitates treatment-covariate interaction analyses and therefore offers an opportunity for personalised medicine.We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different ovulation induction agents, in particular letrozole alone and clomiphene citrate (CC) plus metformin, as compared to CC alone, as the first-line choice for ovulation induction in women with PCOS and infertility, and to explore interactions between treatment and participant-level baseline characteristics.We searched electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 20 December 2018. We included RCTs comparing the following interventions with each other or placebo/no treatment in women with PCOS and infertility: CC, metformin, CC plus metformin, letrozole, gonadotrophin and tamoxifen. We excluded studies on treatment-resistant women. The primary outcome was live birth. We contacted the investigators of eligible RCTs to share the IPD and performed IPD meta-analyses. We assessed the risk of bias by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs.IPD of 20 RCTs including 3962 women with PCOS were obtained. Six RCTs compared letrozole and CC in 1284 women. Compared with CC, letrozole improved live birth rates (3 RCTs, 1043 women, risk ratio [RR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.75, moderate-certainty evidence) and clinical pregnancy rates (6 RCTs, 1284 women, RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.23-1.70, moderate-certainty evidence) and reduced time-to-pregnancy (6 RCTs, 1235 women, hazard ratio [HR] 1.72, 95% CI 1.38-2.15, moderate-certainty evidence). Meta-analyses of effect modifications showed a positive interaction between baseline serum total testosterone levels and treatment effects on live birth (interaction RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.65). Eight RCTs compared CC plus metformin to CC alone in 1039 women. Compared with CC alone, CC plus metformin might improve clinical pregnancy rates (8 RCTs, 1039 women, RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.39, low-certainty evidence) and might reduce time-to-pregnancy (7 RCTs, 898 women, HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00-1.57, low-certainty evidence), but there was insufficient evidence of a difference on live birth rates ( RCTs, 907 women, RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.87-1.35, low-certainty evidence). Meta-analyses of effect modifications showed a positive interaction between baseline  levels and treatment effects on live birth in the comparison between CC plus metformin and CC (interaction RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06).In women with PCOS, letrozole improves live birth and clinical pregnancy rates and reduces time-to-pregnancy compared to CC and therefore can be recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for women with PCOS and infertility. CC plus metformin may increase clinical pregnancy and may reduce time-to-pregnancy compared to CC alone, while there is insufficient evidence of a difference on live birth. Treatment effects of letrozole are influenced by baseline serum levels of total testosterone, while those of CC plus metformin are affected by baseline serum levels of . These interactions between treatments and biomarkers on hyperandrogenaemia and  provide further insights into a personalised approach for the management of anovulatory infertility related to PCOS.© The Author(s) 2019.

This study aimed to determine whether the quality and quantity of dietary carbohydrates were associated with apelin gene expression in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues.In this cross-sectional study, 102 adults who underwent minor abdominal surgery were selected. Approximately 100 mg of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues were collected during the surgery to measure apelin gene expression. Anthropometric measurment, blood samples, and dietary intakes were collected before surgery. The dietary carbohydrate intake, glycemic index (GI), and glycemic load (GL) were determined.The average apelin concentration was 269.6 ± 98.(pg/mL), and 16.3% of participants were  resistant. There was a correlation between  (-value = 0.043), Homeostatic Model Assessment for  (HOMA-IR)(-value = 0.045) and apelin gene expression in visceral adipose tissue. There was a positive association of apelin gene expression with dietary GI and GL after adjustment for age, sex, and waist circumference in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues( < 0.05). Apelin gene expression in visceral( = 0.002) and subcutaneous( = 0.003) adipose tissues was directly associated with foods with a higher GI. There was no association between total carbohydrate intake and apelin gene expression in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues.Dietary GI and GL, not total carbohydrate intake, were positively associated with apelin gene expression in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues.

Hepatic fat was measured by proton MRS,  sensitivity index (SI) calculated by minimal modeling from a frequently-sampled intravenous glucose test, RBC fatty acid profiles by gas chromatography were used to estimate SCD-1 indices. Hepatic fat, S, and SCD-1 were similar in black women and lower than in whites, regardless of menopausal status. Fasting and postprandial large, medium and small TRLPs, but not very small TRLPs, were lower in black women. Fasting large, medium and very small TRLPs negatively correlated with S and positively correlated with visceral and hepatic fat, and SCD-1 activity in both groups. In multivariate models, visceral fat and SCD-1 were associated with total fasting TRLP concentrations (adjR= 0.39, P=0.001). Black women had smaller postprandial changes in large (P=0.005) and medium TRLPs (P=0.007).  Lower visceral fat and SCD-1 activity may contribute to the paradoxical association of lower fasting and postprandial TRLP subfractions despite  in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women.

However, the role of SCG3 in MetS remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between serum SCG3 levels and metabolic parameters in subjects with and without MetS. This was a case control study, and 295 subjects were recruited. Serum SCG3 concentrations were compared between groups. Associations between SCG3 levels and clinico-metabolic parameters were also examined. We found serum SCG3 levels were higher in the MetS group than non-MetS group (122.6 ± 79.2 vs. 90.6 ± 58. nmol/L,  = 0.009). Specifically, elevated SCG3 levels were found in subjects with high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, central obesity, or hypertriglyceridemia. Additionally, MetS was an independent factor of serum SCG3 levels in multivariate linear regression analyses. Moreover, FPG, free fatty acids, and waist circumference were positively associated with serum SCG3 concentrations after adjusting for  levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and cardiovascular risk factors.

A previous study has reported that an association exists between γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the hippocampus. The current study therefore aimed to assess the effect of the GABA receptor (GABA-R) on the long-term potentiation (LTP) and depotentiation of the hippocampal CA1 region in mice with T2DM. Mice were divided into four groups: A normal group consisting of healthy mice and a GABA-R, negative control and blank group all comprising T2DM mice. The weight and blood glucose level of all mice were measured and GABA-R mRNA and protein expression were detected. A hydroxyl free radical (OH-) kit was used to determine the hippocampal OH-content. Using an electrophysiological experiment, the population spike (PS) slope was observed every  min. The results revealed that as GABA-R levels increased, the weight, blood glucose level and OH content of the T2DM mice significantly decreased, and the neuron microstructures in the mice hippocampal tissue improved. The PS slope also significantly increased and the level of depotentiation improved. The results of the current study support the theory that the upregulation of GABA-R protects the neuronal ultrastructure and promotes LTP and depotentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region by inhibiting the accumulation of OH in T2DM mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613346>Effect of a Nutritional and Behavioral Intervention on Energy-Reduced Mediterranean Diet Adherence Among Patients With Metabolic Syndrome: Interim Analysis of the PREDIMED-Plus Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h1><p>High-quality dietary patterns may help prevent chronic disease, but limited data exist from randomized trials about the effects of nutritional and behavioral interventions on dietary changes.To assess the effect of a nutritional and physical activity education program on dietary quality.Preliminary exploratory interim analysis of an ongoing randomized trial. In 23 research centers in Spain, 6874 men and women aged 55 to 75 years with metabolic syndrome and no cardiovascular disease were enrolled in the trial between September 2013 and December 2016, with final data collection in March 2019.Participants were randomized to an intervention group that encouraged an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet, promoted physical activity, and provided behavioral support (n = 3406) or to a control group that encouraged an energy-unrestricted Mediterranean diet (n = 3468). All participants received allotments of extra-virgin olive oil (1 L/mo) and nuts (125 g/mo) for free.The primary outcome was 12-month change in adherence based on the energy-reduced Mediterranean diet (er-MedDiet) score (range, 0-17; higher scores indicate greater adherence; minimal clinically important difference, 1 point).Among 6874 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 65.0 [4.9] years; 3406 [52%] men), 6583 (96%) completed the 12-month follow-up and were included in the main analysis.

In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of ED and evaluate the associated risk factors in a cohort of 254 young (18-49 years) nondiabetic obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg m) men from primary care. Erectile function (International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF-] questionnaire), quality of life (Aging Males' Symptoms [AMS scale]), and body composition analysis (Tanita MC-180MA) were determined. Total testosterone was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to study the factors associated with ED. ED prevalence was 42.1%. Subjects with ED presented higher BMI, waist circumference, number of components of the metabolic syndrome, AMS score, , and a more unfavorable body composition than those without ED. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a pathological AMS score (odds ratio [OR]: 4.238, P < 0.001), degree of obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg m, OR: 2.602, P = 0.005, compared with BMI 30-34.9 kg m), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels (OR: 0.956, P = 0.004), and age (OR: 1.047, P = 0.016) were factors independently associated with ED. In conclusion, we demonstrate that, in a primary care-based cohort of nondiabetic young obese men, ED affected >40% of subjects. A pathological AMS score, the degree of obesity, and age were positively associated with ED, while elevated HDL-cholesterol levels were inversely associated with the odds of presenting ED.

Chi-squared test, independent two-sample t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and multiple logistic regression were used to evaluate the association between IR and TG/HDL-C ratio. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to evaluate the ability of the developed clinical prediction rule to correctly discriminate between subjects of IR positive and IR negative groups.A significant association between IR and TG/HDL-C ratio was identified with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.35 (p-value< 0.001). In multiple logistic regression, high BMI (OR = 1.23; 95% C.I. = 1.13-1.33), hypertension (OR = 1.90; 95% C.I. = 1.12-3.21), diabetes mellitus (OR = .44; 95% C.I. = 2.93-10.08) and high TG/HDL ratio (OR = 1.45; 95% C.I. = 1.23-1.72) were significantly associated with the risk of elevated HOMA-IR. The area under ROC curves for TG/HDL-C ratio was 0.729 and the optimal threshold value was 2.197 where the corresponding of sensitivity and specificity were 72.4 and 65.1%.Our findings showed that the elevated TG/HDL-C ratio was significantly associated with IR and could be used as an indicator of IR among the middle-aged and elderly population in Taiwan. It is clinically available, thus eliminating any additional costs. Future research is warranted to investigate the use of TG/HDL-C ratio combined with other risk factors for predicting IR under diverse ethnic backgrounds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657699>Are there any differences among psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in terms of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors?</a></h1><p>Although the frequency of metabolic syndrome has been studied separately in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, there is no study that compares the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in all three diseases. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and chronic low-grade inflammatory diseases, and to determine the frequency of MetS and  in psoriasis and PsA as compared to RA.A total of 155 patients were included in this cross-sectional study. Fifty patients who were diagnosed with psoriasis, 55 PsA patients who were diagnosed according to the CASPAR criteria, and 50 seropositive RA patients who were diagnosed according to the ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria were included in this study. MetS was diagnosed by the 2005 criteria of International Diabetes Federation. The cardiovascular risk factors and parameters associated with MetS were evaluated.The patients' mean age was significantly higher in the RA. MetS was determined in 33.% of all patients and MetS and  showed no significant difference among the three groups (psoriasis: 36%, PsA: 29%, RA: 36%; p: 0.684 and psoriasis: 70%, PsA: 64%, RA: 66%, respectively; p: 0.785). Triglyceride levels were higher in psoriasis and PsA as compared to the RA (psoriasis: 34%, PsA: 32.7%, RA: 16%, respectively; p: 0.045). The frequency of hypertension was 38% in the RA, which was higher than PsA and psoriasis (p: 0.011).In all three groups, the prevalence of MetS was shown to be higher than the general population. The lack of difference between these groups may be due to the small number of patients, the retrospective study design, and the inequality of the population with respect to age and gender.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635791>Skeletal muscle DNA methylation modifications and psychopharmacologic treatment in bipolar disorder.</a></h1><p>Both severe mental illness and atypical antipsychotics have been independently associated with  and weight gain. Altered regulation of skeletal muscle DNA methylation may play a role. We aimed to evaluate DNA methylation modifications in human skeletal muscle samples to further understand its potential role in the metabolic burden observed in psychiatric patients and psychopharmacologic treatment. Subjects were included in our study if they had a bipolar diagnosis and were currently treated with a mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic. A healthy control group free of psychiatric or physical disease was also included for comparisons. Anthropometric, BMI and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C%) were measured. Fasting skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained and methylation levels of -methycytosine (-mC), -hydroxymethylcytosine (-hmC) and -formylcytosine (-fC) were measured. Skeletal muscle global methylation of -mC and -fC were significantly higher in bipolar subjects compared to healthy controls. -mC was significantly higher in the AAP group compared to the mood stabilizer group. Significant correlations were observed between -fC methylation and HbA1C%. Our findings suggest that psychiatric disease and treatment may influence some methylation measures in the skeletal muscle of patients with bipolar disorder, which may be further influenced by medication treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

Early mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are linked to impaired glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle. In this study, we investigated the effects of BPA on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and  sensitivity. L6 myotubes were treated with BPA (1 nM-10 nM) during the last 24 h of differentiation. Following exposure to 10 nM of BPA, resting and maximal oxygen consumption rates were decreased, whereas mitochondrial proton leak was increased. Overall metabolic activity, measured by redox ability, was decreased in L6 myotubes exposed to 10 nM of BPA. At this concentration, -stimulated glucose uptake was increased, which corresponded to an increased phosphorylation of the  signaling protein Akt, and increased glycolysis measured by extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Acute BPA exposure did not alter levels of oxidative stress markers in muscle cells, but significantly increased mitochondrial proton leak, which is known to be involved in decreased ROS production. The effects of BPA on glucose uptake, but not mitochondrial function, were reversed by the use of an estrogen receptor antagonist. These results suggest that acute exposure of L6 myotubes at only high concentrations of BPA alters glucose metabolism, which is likely a compensatory response to reduced mitochondrial energy production capacity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

High-quality trials are required to test the hypothesis that vitamin D is a direct contributor to type 2 diabetes pathogenesis.The purpose of this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was to investigate the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on  (IR) and β-cell function in people with prediabetes and suboptimal vitamin D status (<50 nmol/L).Sixty-six individuals were randomly assigned to receive 3000 IU (75 µg) vitamin D3 or placebo daily for 26 wk. Compliance was monitored by pill count and change in serum 25(OH)D concentration using LC-MS. The primary endpoint was between-group difference in change in IR assessed using a 2-step euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp combined with infusion of tritiated glucose. An oral-glucose-tolerance test was performed pre- and postintervention to calculate indices of β-cell function. Between-group comparisons were made using ANCOVA.In total, 64 participants completed the study.

Fasting blood was collected for lipids, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), adiponectin, and fetuin-A. Homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), whole-body  sensitivity index (WBISI), insulinogenic index (IGI), and oral disposition index (oDI) were calculated after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test.Fifty-two percent of participants were male; mean (±SD) age was 28. ± 7.8 years, and body mass index was 22.4 ± 3.0 kg/m.

This intervention was modeled on standard brief motivational interventions for alcohol used in the workplace that promote health knowledge and goal setting.Outcomes included changes in SSB intake, Homeostatic Model Assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and measures of abdominal adiposity. The primary associations tested were the correlation between changes in SSB intake and changes in HOMA-IR.Among the 214 study participants, 124 (57.9%) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 41.2 (11.0) years and a baseline mean (SD) body mass index of 29.4 (6.). They reported a mean daily intake of 1050 mL (35 fl oz) of SSBs at baseline and 540 mL (18 fl oz) at follow-up-a 510-mL (17-fl oz) (48.6%) decrease (P < .001). Reductions in SSB intake correlated with improvements in HOMA-IR (r = 0.16; P = .03). Those not randomized to receive the brief intervention reduced their SSB intake by a mean (SD) of 246.0 (84.0) mL (8.2 [2.8] fl oz), while those also receiving the brief intervention reduced SSB intake by 762.0 (84.0) mL (25.4 [2.8] fl oz). From baseline to follow-up, there were significant reductions in mean (SE) waist circumference (2.1 [2.8] cm; P < .001).This study's findings suggest that the workplace sales ban was associated with a reduction in SSB intake and a significant reduction in waist circumference among employees within 10 months. The randomized clinical trial portion of this study found that targeting those at high risk with a brief motivational intervention led to additional improvements. Workplace sales bans may offer a promising new private-sector strategy for reducing the health harms of SSB intake.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622373>Alteration of adipose tissue immune cell milieu towards the suppression of inflammation in high fat diet fed mice by flaxseed oil supplementation.</a></h1><p>The present study evaluates the effect of flaxseed oil (FXO) supplementation on adipose tissue macrophages (ATM's), E and D series resolvin (Rv) levels and adipose tissue inflammation.

In this study, we aimed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of an IFD to reduce body mass index and glucose metabolism in the general population without diabetes mellitus. Cochrane, PubMed, and Embase databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that compared an IFD with a regular diet or a continuous calorie restriction diet. The effectiveness of an IFD was estimated by the weighted mean difference (WMD) for several variables associated with glucometabolic parameters including body mass index (BMI) and fasting glucose. The pooled mean differences of outcomes were calculated using a random effects model. From 2814 studies identified through a literature search, we finally selected 12 articles (545 participants).

The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and  Study (ORIGINS) enrolled 230 diabetes-free adults (77% female) aged 20 to 55 y (mean ± SD, 34 ± 10 y) from whom baseline subgingival plaque and longitudinal FPG were measured. DNA was extracted from subgingival plaque, and V3 to V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. FPG was measured at baseline and again at 2 y; glucose change was defined as follow-up minus baseline. Multivariable linear models regressed 2-y glucose change onto baseline measures of community diversity and abundances of 369 individual taxa. A microbial dysbiosis index (MDI) summarizing top individual taxa associated with glucose change was calculated and used in regression models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, body mass index, and baseline glucose levels. Statistical significance was based on the false discovery rate (FDR; <0.05) or a Bonferroni-corrected  value of 1 × 10, derived from the initial 369 hypothesis tests for specific taxa. Mean 2-y FPG change was 1. ± 8 mg/dL. Baseline levels of 9 taxa predicted FPG change (all FDR <0.05), among which  sp oral taxon 097 and  spp predicted greater FPG change, while  sp oral taxon 498 predicted lesser FPG change (all 3  values, Bonferroni significant). The MDI explained 6% of variation in longitudinal glucose change ( < 0.001), and baseline glucose levels explained 10% of variation ( < 0.0001).

Inulin-type carbohydrate (ITC) is a kind of fermentable fructan that can reduce glucose and ameliorate IR in an animal model, but the effect in clinical trials is controversial.The authors conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the effect of ITC supplementation in ameliorating IR in T2DM and obese patients.Multiple databases were queried for studies before December 25, 2018, which involved supplementation with ITC in ameliorating IR in T2DM and obese patients. Studies that involved meta-analysis of the body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting  (FI), HbA1c, homeostatic model assessment IR (HOMA-IR), and quantitative  sensitivity check index (QUICKI) of T2DM subjects were included. HOMA-IR and QUICKI were identified as the primary outcomes. A systematic review was performed to evaluate the effect of ITC on IR in obese patients.The database search yielded 25 studies, which met the inclusion criteria; 11 articles were meta-analyzed, and  other articles on T2DM and 9 articles on simple obesity were systematically reviewed. Our results did not find ITC supplementation decrease postintervention and reduction data of BMI ( = 0.08). However, it can significantly decrease postintervention and reduction data of FPG, FI, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR. Heterogeneity was eliminated by subgroup analysis according to baseline BMI. There was no significant difference in the amelioration of QUICKI between the ITC and control groups. However, the difference was statistically significant and the heterogeneity was eliminated after subgroup analysis according to intakes of ITC. 14 articles for a systematic review found that the results of blood glucose, , and HbA1c were controversial. Only one of the seven studies on simple obesity concluded that ITC intervention significantly ameliorated HOMA-IR, while the other six did not.Supplementation of ITC can ameliorate IR in T2DM, especially in obese T2DM patients, but the effects are controversial in obese patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620992>Systemic Administration of Rejuvenated Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improves Liver Metabolism in Equine Metabolic Syndrome (EMS)- New Approach in Veterinary Regenerative Medicine.</a></h1><p>Equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) is characterized by adiposity,  dysregulation and increased risk for laminitis. Increased levels of specific liver enzymes in the peripheral blood are typical findings in horses diagnosed with EMS. Current management of EMS is based on caloric restriction and increased physical activity. However, new potential treatment options are arising such as the transplantation of autologous adipose stem cells (ASC). However, cytophysiological properties of ASC derived from EMS horses are impaired which strongly limits their therapeutic potential. We hypothesized, that in vitro pharmacotherapy of those cells with -azacytidine (AZA) and resveratrol (RES) before their clinical application can reverse the aged phenotype of those cells and improve clinical outcome of autologous therapy. A 9 year old Dutch Warmblood Horse used for driving, was presented with severe obesity, . After EMS diagnosis, the animal received three intravenous injections of autologous, AZA/RES treated ASCs at weekly intervals. The therapeutic effect was assessed by the analysis of liver specific enzymes in the blood. ASC-transplantation reduced levels of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate transaminase (AST).

However, the association between VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) with premature atherosclerosis and (i.e. arterial) inflammation is not completely understood. To provide more insight into this association, we investigated the association between arterial F-fluordeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) uptake, as a measure of arterial inflammation, and metabolic syndrome (MetS) markers in early T2DM patients.Forty-four patients with early T2DM, without glucose lowering medication, were studied (median age 63 [IQR 54-66] years, median BMI 30.4 [IQR 27.-35.8]). Arterial inflammation was quantified using glucose corrected maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) FDG of the aorta, carotid, iliac, and femoral arteries, and corrected for background activity (blood pool) as target-to-background ratio (TBR). VAT and SAT volumes (cm) were automatically segmented using computed tomography (CT) between levels L1-L5. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was assessed by liver function test and CT.VAT volume, but not SAT volume, correlated with TBR (r = 0.325, p = 0.031). Linear regression models showed a significant association, even after sequential adjustment for potentially influencing MetS components. Interaction term VAT volume * sex and additional components including HbA1c, , NAFLD, adiponectin, leptin, and C- reactive protein (CRP) did not change the independent association between VAT volume and TBR.CT-assessed VAT volume is positively associated with FDG-PET assessed arterial inflammation, independently of factors thought to potentially mediate these effects.

On overnight experimental visits, participants performed full-body  exercise (RE; 65% 1RM) and were randomly assigned to consume either daytime PRO (PRO, 30 g casein) 30 min post-RE and presleep (30 min before bed) noncaloric, sensory-matched placebo (PLA, 0 g casein) (PRO-PLA), or the opposite (PLA-PRO), switching the order of the supplements on the following visit. SCAAT lipolysis, resting metabolism (indirect calorimetry), and plasma biomarkers (glucose, , nonesterified fatty acids, glycerol) were measured at baseline, overnight, and the next morning.There were no differences in overnight SCAAT lipolysis between conditions indicated by interstitial glycerol concentrations (PRO-PLA: baseline, 669 ± 137; next morning, 321 ± 77.1; PLA-PRO: baseline, 524 ± 109; next morning, 333 ± 68.0 μM), fat oxidation (PRO-PLA: baseline, .70 ± 0.35; next morning, .00 ± 0.28; PLA-PRO: baseline, 6.59 ± 0.32; next morning, .44 ± 0.27 g/min), or any other measure.There was no difference between the effects of daytime and presleep PRO supplementation on SCAAT lipolysis or whole-body substrate utilization in -trained women. Presleep PRO is a viable option for increasing PRO consumption in -trained women because it does not blunt overnight lipolysis, and will therefore likely not lead to increases in subcutaneous abdominal fat.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as .Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559966>Long-term changes of gut microbiota, antibiotic , and metabolic parameters after Helicobacter pylori eradication: a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial.</a></h1><p>In first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori, we have previously shown that the eradication frequency was 83·7% (95% CI 80·4-86·6) for triple therapy for 14 days (T14; lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, and clarithromycin 500 mg, all given twice daily), 85·9% (82·7-88·6) for concomitant therapy for 10 days (C10; lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, clarithromycin 500 mg, and metronidazole 500 mg, all given twice daily), and 90·4% (87·6-92·6) for bismuth quadruple therapy for 10 days (BQ10; bismuth tripotassium dicitrate 300 mg four times a day, lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily, tetracycline 500 mg four times a day, and metronidazole 500 mg three times a day). In this follow-up study, we assess short-term and long-term effects of these therapies on the gut microbiota, antibiotic , and metabolic parameters.This was a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial done at nine medical centres in Taiwan. Adult patients (>20 years) with documented H pylori infection were randomly assigned (1:1:1, with block sizes of six) to receive T14, C10, or BQ10. We assessed long-term outcomes (reinfection frequency, changes in the gut microbiota, antibiotic , and metabolic parameters) in patients with available data, excluding all protocol violators and those with unknown post-treatment H pylori status. Faecal samples were collected before treatment and 2 weeks, 2 months, and at least 1 year after eradication therapy. Amplification of the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA was done followed by high-throughput sequencing. Susceptibility testing for faecal Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was done. This trial is complete and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, .Between July 17, 2013, and April 20, 2016, 1620 participants were randomly assigned to the three treatment groups (540 [33%] per group). 1214 (75%) attended 1-year follow-up and are included in this analysis. Compared with baseline, alpha diversity was significantly reduced 2 weeks after T14 (p=0·0002), C10 (p<0·0001), and BQ10 (p<0·0001) treatment. Beta diversity was also significantly altered 2 weeks after T14 (p=0·0010), C10 (p=0·0001), and BQ10 (p=0·0001). Alpha diversity and beta diversity were restored at week 8 (p=0·14 and p=0·918, respectively) and 1 year (p=0·14 and p=0·918) after T14, but were not fully recovered at week 8 and after 1 year in patients treated with C10 (p=0·0001 and p=0·013 at week 8; p=0·019 and p=0·064 at 1 year) and BQ10 (p<0·0001 and p=0·0002; p=0·001 and p=0·029).

Although bodyweight and body-mass index slightly increased, there were significant improvements in metabolic parameters, with a decrease in , triglycerides, and LDL and an increase in HDL. Overall, there was no significant change in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome at week 8 and 1 year after T14, C10, and BQ10.Eradication of H pylori infection has minimal disruption of the microbiota, no effect on antibiotic  of E coli, and some positive effects on metabolic parameters.

While prolonged HFD-induced metabolic complications are partly mediated by increased food intake during the light (inactive) phase, such a link has not yet been established in short-term HFD-fed mice. Herein, we hypothesized that a short bout of HFD desynchronizes feeding behavior, thereby contributing to glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis. To this end, 12-wk-old C57BL/6J littermates were fed a HFD for 4 days either ad libitum or intermittently. Intermittent-fed mice were fasted for 8 h during their inactive phase. Initiation of HFD led to an immediate increase in food intake already during the first light phase. Moreover, glucose tolerance was significantly impaired in ad libitum- but not in intermittent HFD-fed mice, indicating that desynchronized feeding behavior contributes to short-term HFD-induced glucose intolerance. Of note, overall food intake was similar between the groups, as was body weight. However, intermittent HFD-fed mice revealed higher fat depot weights. Phosphorylation of hormone sensitivity lipase and free fatty acid release from isolated adipocytes were significantly elevated, suggesting increased lipolysis in intermittent HFD-fed mice. Moreover, hepatic mRNA expression of lipogenetic enzymes and liver triglyceride levels were significantly increased in intermittent HFD-fed mice. Importantly, food deprivation decreased respiratory exchange ratio promptly in intermittent- but not in ad libitum HFD-fed mice. In conclusion, retaining a normal feeding pattern prevented HFD-induced impairment of metabolic flexibility in short-term HFD-fed mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649313>Improving obesity and blood pressure.</a></h1><p>Obesity-associated hypertension is a serious public health concern. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by  stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular . Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut microbiota contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to metabolic disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or  kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related metabolic disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485206>Blood pressure in postmenopausal women with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder at reproductive age, affecting 6-10% of females in this group. The aetiology of this syndrome is not fully understood. Genetics, endocrinology factors, and the influence of the environment are possible causes of this syndrome. PCOS is characterised by menstrual disorders, hyperandrogenism, and abnormalities in ovarian morphology as well as metabolic disorders. PCOS increases the risk of overweight and obesity, diabetes, endometrial cancer, and cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension along with all its long-term consequences. There are limited studies about cardiovascular disorders, especially hypertension, in postmenopausal women with a history of PCOS. The presented paper is an attempt to briefly summarise literature data concerning the influence of this disease on the incidence of hypertension and blood pressure control in postmenopausal women. Women with PCOS more often present features of metabolic syndrome and have increased cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension is 2. times higher than in corresponding healthy peers. Furthermore, hyperandrogenaemia is associated with elevated blood pressure independent of the patient's age, , obesity, and dyslipidaemia. In view of this, these patients should be thoroughly screened for hypertensive disorders and educated about the lifestyle modifications that could prevent hypertension later in life.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498243>Metabolically Healthy Obesity and the Risk of Erosive Esophagitis: A Cohort Study.</a></h1><p>Obesity is an established risk factor of erosive esophagitis, and metabolic unhealthiness has been implicated in the pathogenesis of erosive esophagitis. Yet, the risk of erosive esophagitis among obese individuals without obesity-related metabolic unhealthiness, a condition referred to as "metabolically healthy obese (MHO)", remains unclear. We examined the association between body mass index (BMI) categories and the development of erosive esophagitis in a cohort of metabolically healthy individuals.We conducted a cohort study of 14,725 asymptomatic adults free of erosive esophagitis and metabolic abnormalities, who underwent repeated health checkups including screening endoscopy. A metabolically healthy state was defined as having no metabolic syndrome components and a homeostasis model assessment of  <2.. The presence of erosive esophagitis was determined using endoscopy.During 81,385.2 person-years of follow-up, 1,865 participants developed erosive esophagitis (incidence rate, 22.9 per 1,000 person-years). The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident erosive esophagitis comparing overweight (BMI 23.0-24.9) and obese (≥25) with normal-weight participants (18.-22.9) were 1.12 (1.00-1.25) and 1.29 (1.14-1.47), respectively. In dose-response analyses, increasing BMI also showed positive association with overall and LA-B grade or higher. The association persisted in MHO individuals without central obesity. The association between waist circumference categories and the development of erosive esophagitis was also evident.In a large cohort of strictly defined metabolically healthy men and women, the MHO phenotype was associated with an increased incidence of erosive esophagitis, providing evidence that the MHO phenotype is not protective from gastroesophageal reflux disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666643>Empagliflozin and Dulaglutide are Effective against Obesity-induced Airway Hyperresponsiveness and Fibrosis in A Murine Model.</a></h1><p>Patients with asthma with obesity experience severe symptoms, are unresponsive to conventional asthma treatment, and lack proper pharmacotherapy. Empagliflozin and dulaglutide, developed for diabetes, reduce weight, decrease , and exert additive effects. We evaluated the efficacy of empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination on obesity-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung fibrosis using a murine model. We assigned C57BL/6J mice to five groups: control, high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD with empagliflozin, dulaglutide, or both. Mice received a 12-week HFD, empagliflozin ( days/week, oral gavage), and dulaglutide (once weekly, intraperitoneally). Both drugs significantly attenuated HFD-induced weight increase, abnormal glucose metabolism, and abnormal serum levels of leptin and , and co-treatment was more effective. Both drugs significantly alleviated HFD-induced AHR, increased macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and co-treatment was more effective on AHR. HFD-induced lung fibrosis was decreased by both drugs alone and combined. HFD induced interleukin (IL)-17, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and IL-1β mRNA and protein expression, which was significantly reduced by empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 showed similar patterns without significant differences. HFD-enhanced T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell differentiation was improved by both drugs. Empagliflozin and dulaglutide could be a promising therapy for obesity-induced asthma and showed additive effects in combination.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501648> and its correlation with chemerin and visfatin in Saudi patients with hyperthyroidism.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to assess the relationship between chemerin and visfatin concentrations and  in Saudi women with hyperthyroidism.Seventy healthy participants and 70 participants with hyperthyroidism were recruited for the study.

Years.</a></h1><p>The evidence that fetal life and early infancy are "critical" or "sensitive" ages for later cardiometabolic disease is based on flawed methods for comparing different age periods. Moreover, most previous studies have limited their focus to weight gain, rather than growth in length/height or body mass index (BMI). We undertook a secondary analysis of PROBIT (1996-2010), a birth cohort study nested within a large cluster-randomized trial in the Republic of Belarus, with repeated measures of weight and length/height from birth to 11. years of age. We used mixed effects linear models to analyze associations of changes in standardized weight, length/height, and BMI during five age periods (conception to birth, birth to 3 months, 3 to 12 months, 12 months to 6. years, and 6. to 11. years) with fasting glucose, , , β-cell function, and adiponectin at age 11. years. We observed strong associations between the metabolic markers and all three growth measures, with the largest magnitudes observed during the latest age period (6. to 11. years) and negligible associations during gestation and the first year of life. Later age-periods appear more "sensitive" than earlier periods to the adverse metabolic association of rapid growth in childhood.© The Author(s) 2019.

Hepassocin is a novel hepatokine that causes hepatic steatosis and induces  (IR). However, the role of hepassocin in obesity remains obscure. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between hepassocin levels and obesity. In total, 371 subjects who had a normal weight (NW), were overweight, or were obese were enrolled. We found that hepassocin levels in subjects who were overweight (6,705 ± 1,707 pg/ml) or obese (7,335 ± 2,077 pg/ml) were significantly higher than those of subjects with a NW (,767 ± 1,500 pg/ml) (p < .001, test for trend). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the body-mass index, waist circumference, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and homeostatic model assessment of IR were independently associated with hepassocin after adjusting for age, sex, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, log triglycerides, alanine transaminase, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate. This study provides evidence that subjects who were overweight or obese had significantly higher hepassocin levels than those with a NW.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of maqui on the onset and development of the obese phenotype and  was investigated in high fat diet-induced obese mice supplemented with a lyophilized maqui berry. Maqui-dietary supplemented animals showed better  response and decreased weight gain but also a differential expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, multilocular lipid droplet formation and thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). These changes correlated with an increased expression of the carbohydrate response element binding protein b (), the sterol regulatory binding protein 1c () and Cellular repressor of adenovirus early region 1A-stimulated genes 1 () and an improvement in the fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) signaling. Our evidence suggests that maqui dietary supplementation activates the induction of fuel storage and thermogenesis characteristic of a brown-like phenotype in scWAT and counteracts the unhealthy metabolic impact of an HFD.

Beyond the simple level of adiposity, the pattern of fat distribution may influence these risks. We sought to examine if higher android fat distribution was associated with different hemodynamic, metabolic or vascular profile compared to a lower accumulation of android fat deposits in young overweight males.Forty-six participants underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and were stratified into two groups. Group 1: low level of android fat (<9.%) and group 2: high level of android fat (>9.%). Assessments comprised measures of plasma lipid and glucose profile, blood pressure, endothelial function [reactive hyperemia index (RHI)] and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA).There were no differences in weight, BMI, total body fat and lean mass between the two groups.

Pathophysiological links between ED and testosterone were re-evaluated. : In all, 357 patients with ED were evaluated; 53 patients with primary, psychogenic, surgical, post-traumatic or drug-induced ED were excluded. The remaining 304 patients were evaluated after obtaining written informed consent. The Institutional Review Board approved the study. We assessed comorbidities, IIEF- scores, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) based on International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), blood sugars, lipid and hormonal profiles, and vitamin D3 levels. Further evaluation was done when indicated. : In all, 171 patients had MetS and 134 had pre-existing comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, 58; hypertension, 73; coronary artery disease, 13). The mean (SD) age was 44.6 (9.21) years and IIEF- score was 13.81 (3.17). ED severity was significantly correlated with presence of MetS. On multivariate analysis, there were significant correlations between ED and waist circumference, serum triglycerides, and fasting blood sugar. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between serum testosterone and IIEF- score ( = +0.292). The mean (SD) IR value (using the HOMA-IR formula) was 2.64 (2.87), which was statistically and negatively correlated with IIEF- scores ( = - 0.398). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that an IIEF- score of <14 predicted MetS and a HOMA-IR value of >2.1778 predicted MetS. : MetS or its components were present in 56.25% of the patients.

After 6 months, there was no change in HbA1c (8.3±1.2 vs 9.1±3.0%, p=0.27), but there was increased whole-body glucose disposal (22.8±4.9 vs 30.1±10.0 µmol/kgLBM/min, p=0.02), and muscle (0.7±0.1 vs 2.0±0.2 µmol/min/100ml, p<0.0001) and WAT glucose uptake (1.2±0.2 vs 2.2±0.3 µmol/min/100ml, p<0.0001). BAT glucose uptake could not be quantified due to small volume. There were no signs or symptoms of hyperthyroidism.Liothyronine administered at well-tolerated doses did not improve HbA1c. However, the observed increases in muscle and WAT glucose uptake support the proposed mechanism that liothyronine increases tissue glucose uptake.

We exposed zebrafish embryos to three different concentrations of PCB153 starting from 4 hours post-fertilization (hpf) to 120 hpf. We quantified gross morphological changes, behavioral phenotypes, gene expression changes and circadian behavior in the larvae. There were no developmental defects during the exposure period, but starting at 7 dpf, we observed spinal deformity in the 10 μM PCB153 treated group. A total of 633, 2227, and 3378 differentially expressed genes were observed in 0.1 μM (0.036 μg/mL), 1 μM (0.36 μg/mL) and 10 μM (3.6 μg/mL) PCB153 treated embryos, respectively. Of these, 301 genes were common to all treatment groups. KEGG pathway analysis revealed enrichment of genes related to circadian rhythm, FoxO signaling and  pathways. Behavioral analysis revealed that PCB153 exposure significantly alters circadian behavior. Disruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with the development of metabolic and neurological diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of action of environmental chemicals in disrupting metabolism and other physiological processes is essential.© The Author(s) 2019.

The diabetes model was established by intraperitoneal injection of 0.1% Streptozocin (STZ) solution (50 mg/kg). After that, EA (2 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to bilateral "Zusanli" (ST36), "Yinlingquan" (SP9) and "Shenshu" (BL23) for 10 min, once a day, 6 times a week for 2 weeks. The fasting blood glucose (FBG) and fasting serum  (FINS) contents were assayed by using ELISA, and the homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) was calculated. The body weight, and wet weight of bilateral gastrocnemius muscles were measured. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the gastrocnemius muscle was measured after H.E. stai-ning. The expression of MuRF1, Fbxo32, Myh2, Myh4 and Myh7 mRNAs in the gastrocnemius tissue was tested using quantitative real time-PCR.Compared with the control group, the FBG and HOMA-IR were significantly higher (<0.05), and the FINS, body weight were significantly lower (<0.05) after intravenous injection of STZ for 1, 2, 3, 4,  weeks respectively. Following EA treatment and compared with the model group, the FBG and HOMA-IR were significantly down-regulated (<0.05), and the FINS and body weight were considerably increased (<0.05). Following modeling and compared with the control group, the wet weight of gastrocnemius muscle, CSA, and expression levels of Myh2, Myh4 and Myh7 mRNAs were obviously decreased, and the expression of MuRF1 and Fbxo32 mRNA was obviously increased in the model group (<0.05). After EA treatment, the gastrocnemius muscle wet weight, CSA, expression levels of Myh2, Myh4 and Myh7 mRNA were significantly up-regulated (<0.05), and the expression levels of MuRF1 and Fbxo32 mRNA were markedly down-regulated in comparison with those of the model group (<0.05).EA treatment can delay the atrophy of gastrocnemius muscle (skeletal muscle) in diabetes rats possibly by improving the degradation of myosin heavy chain via regulating the expression of muscular MuRF1, Fbxo32, Myh2, Myh4 and Myh7 mRNAs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494081>Epicardial adipose tissue volume is associated with left ventricular remodelling in calcific aortic valve stenosis.</a></h1><p>The severity of left ventricular (LV) remodelling is only partially related to the severity of aortic valve stenosis; additional factors, including diabetes, , obesity and metabolic syndrome, may play important roles. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), now considered as a metabolically active organ, is also linked to these factors.To analyse the association between EAT volume measured using computed tomography and LV remodelling in a prospective cohort of patients with aortic stenosis.Consecutive asymptomatic patients with at least mild degenerative aortic stenosis enrolled in a prospective cohort that aimed to assess the determinants of aortic stenosis occurrence and progression constituted our population.We enrolled 143 patients (78± years; 65% men). Mean LV mass and EAT volume were 219±64g and 134±56mL, respectively. LV hypertrophy was diagnosed in 86 patients (60%), and concentric hypertrophy (32%) was the main remodelling pattern. EAT was associated with body mass index (P<0.001) and body surface area (P<0.001), but not with age (P=0.33) or aortic stenosis severity (all P>0.10). EAT was correlated with LV mass (r=0.41; P<0.0001), and after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index/body surface area, hypertension, waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and aortic stenosis severity, EAT was independently associated with LV mass (P=0.01/P=0.02). Similar results were found when EAT and LV mass index (adjusted for body surface area) were considered instead of absolute values (P=0.04).In this prospective cohort of patients with aortic stenosis, EAT volume was independently associated with LV mass. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this link.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, in which 36 untrained women were randomly assigned to either a leucine or placebo supplement group coupled with 10 weeks of RT, performed thrice weekly, while ingesting either  g of placebo or leucine. Before and after RT, body composition and muscle strength were assessed and venous blood samples obtained to determine the levels of estradiol, testosterone, -like growth factor-1, growth hormone, and cortisol. Data were analyzed by utilizing separate 2 × 2 [group × time (pretest and posttest)] factorial analyses of variance with repeated measures ( ≤ .05).  There were no significant changes or differences between groups in fat free mass or with any of the serum hormones assessed in response to supplementation. However, there were significant increases in strength in both groups in response to RT, but not supplementation.  Peri- and postmenopausal women had significant increases in strength following 10 weeks of RT, with no additional effects from supplementing with leucine. There were no significant changes in either group regarding fat free mass or serum hormones.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566148>Adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is associated with lower presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in middle-aged and elderly adults.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have shown that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet might contribute to managing risk factors of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but evidence is limited. We examined the association of DASH diet score (DASH-DS) with NAFLD, as well as the intermediary effects of serum retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4), serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum TAG, homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) and BMI.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a population-based cohort study. Dietary data and lifestyle factors were assessed by face-to-face interviews and the DASH-DS was then calculated. We assessed serum RBP4, hs-CRP and TAG and calculated HOMA-IR. The presence and degree of NAFLD were determined by abdominal sonography.Guangzhou, China.Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study participants, aged 40-75 years at baseline (n 3051).After adjusting for potential covariates, we found an inverse association between DASH-DS and the presence of NAFLD (Ptrend = 0·009). The OR (95 % CI) of NAFLD for quintiles 2- were 0·78 (0·62, 0·98), 0·74 (0·59, 0·94), 0·69 (0·55, 0·86) and 0·77 (0·61, 0·97), respectively. Path analyses indicated that a higher DASH-DS was associated with lower serum RBP4, hs-CRP, TAG, HOMA-IR and BMI, which were positively associated with the degree of NAFLD.Adherence to the DASH diet was independently associated with a marked lower prevalence of NAFLD in Chinese adults, especially in women and those without abdominal obesity, and might be mediated by reducing RBP4, hs-CRP, TAG, HOMA-IR and BMI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507207>Potential impact of auxin in modulation of  in diabetic rats.</a></h1><p>The rational of this study to find out the impact of auxins in prevention of diabetic complications in rats.

We have designed this study to compare the effects of weight reduction on histological activity and fibrosis of lean and non-lean NASH.We have included 20 lean and 20 non-lean histologically proven NASH patients. BMI < 25 kg/m2 was defined as non-lean. Informed consent was taken from each subject. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moderate exercise along with dietary restriction was advised for both groups for weight reduction. After 1 year, 16 non-lean and 15 lean had completed second liver biopsy.Age, sex, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltrasferase (GGT), Homeostasis model assessment  (HOMA-IR), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was similar in both groups. Steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis was similar in the two groups. In lean/non-lean group, any amount of weight reduction, ≥ % weight reduction and ≥ 7% weight reduction was found in respectively 8/11, /6 and 2/6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ % was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean NASH.© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.

Pyrroline--carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) plays a critical role in metabolic profiles of tumors. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the mechanisms of PYCR1 on cell growth and survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Protein and mRNA expression levels of PYCR1 in 140 pairs of tumor and adjacent normal liver tissues of HCC patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Expressions of PYCR1 were inhibited in BEL-7404 cells and SMMC-7721 cells using gene interference technology. The cell proliferation was detected by Celigo and MTT assay. The colony formation assay was also performed. The cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometric assay. The effect of PYCR1 interference on tumor growth was observed by xenograft nude mice assay in vivo. The downstream pathway of PYCR1 interference was searched by microarray and bioinformatics analysis, and validated by qRT-PCR and western blot.PYCR1 levels were significantly up-regulated in HCC tumor tissues than adjacent normal liver tissues in both protein and mRNA levels (P < 0.01). In vitro, the cell proliferation was significantly slower in shPYCR1 group than shCtrl group in BEL-7404 and SMMC-7721 cells (P < 0.001). The colony number was significantly smaller after PYCR1 interference (P < 0.01). The percentage of apoptosis cells significantly increased in shPYCR1 group (P < 0.01). In vivo, PYCR1 interference could obviously suppress tumor growth in xenograft nude mice. The volume and weight of tumors were significantly smaller via PYCR1 interference. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway significantly altered, and  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) were significantly down-regulated by PYCR1 interference in both mRNA and protein levels (P < 0.001).PYCR1 interference could inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell apoptosis in HCC through regluting JNK/IRS1 pathway. Our study will provide a drug target for HCC therapy and a potential biomarker for its diagnosis or prognosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31486447>The effects of resveratrol on metabolic status in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease.</a></h1><p>This study was performed to investigate the effects of resveratrol on metabolic status in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coronary heart disease (CHD). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed with 56 patients having T2DM and CHD. The patients were randomly divided into two groups to receive either 500 mg resveratrol per day (n = 28) or placebo (n = 28) for 4 weeks. Resveratrol reduced fasting glucose (β-10.04 mg dL; 95% CI, -18.23, -1.86; P = 0.01),  (β-1.09 μIU mL; 95% CI, -1.93, -0.24; P = 0.01) and  (β-0.48; 95% CI, -0.76, -0.21; P = 0.001) and significantly increased  sensitivity (β 0.006; 95% CI, 0.001, 0.01; P = 0.02) when compared with the placebo. Resveratrol also significantly increased HDL-cholesterol levels (β 3.38 mg dL; 95% CI, 1.72, .05; P < 0.001) and significantly decreased the total-/HDL-cholesterol ratio (β-0.36; 95% CI, -0.59, -0.13; P = 0.002) when compared with the placebo. Additionally, resveratrol caused a significant increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (β 58.88 mmol L; 95% CI, 17.33, 100.44; P = 0.006) and a significant reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (β-0.21 μmol L; 95% CI, -0.41, -0.005; P = 0.04) when compared with the placebo. Resveratrol upregulated PPAR-γ (P = 0.01) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) (P = 0.01) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of T2DM patients with CHD. Resveratrol supplementation did not have any effect on inflammatory markers. Four-week supplementation of resveratrol in patients with T2DM and CHD had beneficial effects on glycemic control, HDL-cholesterol levels, the total-/HDL-cholesterol ratio, TAC and MDA levels. Resveratrol also upregulated PPAR-γ and SIRT1 in the PBMCs of T2DM patients with CHD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526197>Are serum levels of ADAMTS5, TAS and TOS at 24-28 gestational weeks associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in gestational diabetic women?</a></h1><p>We aimed to determine the role of placental A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs  (ADAMTS5), and maternal serum ADAMTS5, total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) levels at 24-28th gestational weeks in GDM. This study included 57 patients, who had been diagnosed as having GDM at their 24-28th gestational week, and 29 controls. The maternal blood samples were collected at the 24-28th gestational week and ADAMTS5 was studied with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, whereas an automated colorimetric method was used to study TAS, TOS, and OSI. The level of ADAMTS5 in maternal serum of patients with GDM were significantly lower than the controls ( .017); whereas TOS and OSI levels were significantly higher 003 and 008). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed ADAMTS5 and TOS levels were independently associated with adverse perinatal outcomes (004 and 018). We found that serum ADAMTS5 levels decreased and TOS level increased in GDM pregnant at 24-28th gestational weeks. In addition, we found that increased levels of serum ADAMTS5 and decreased TOS levels at 24-28th weeks were associated with adverse perinatal outcomes independent of the mode of treatment in GDM. Impact statement  Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common medical complications of pregnancy. The , which starts at the 24-28th gestational weeks, increases during gestation. GDM increases maternal complications like preeclampsia, cesarean rate, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes after pregnancy; and neonatal complications like macrosomia, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, delivery trauma, shoulder dystocia, and adult-onset obesity, and diabetes.  A significant relationship between ADAMTS5, TOS levels and adverse perinatal outcome.  and was observed.  Based on this finding, we concluded that increased levels of oxidative stress and decreased ADAMTS5 levels are associated with GDM and predictive for adverse perinatal outcomes. The results of the present study were consistent with the previous reports and indicated that increased oxidative stress in GDM patients are related to adverse perinatal outcomes.</p></html>
