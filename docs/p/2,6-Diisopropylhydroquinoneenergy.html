Prior work suggests hydration status does not alter appetite or  intake, with mixed findings regarding appetite hormone secretion. However, an extensive investigation into both the psychological and physiological appetitive responses to hydration status has never been conducted.To investigate the effect of hydration status on multiple facets of appetite.After 3 days pre-trial standardization, a range of appetite tasks were conducted when hypohydrated (HYPO) and euhydrated (EUHY) in 16 healthy participants (8 men). Hydration status was manipulated via dehydration in a heat tent for 60 min and subsequent fluid restriction (HYPO) or replacement (EUHY). The next day, a food reward computer task was completed followed by an ad libitum pasta meal. Pre- and post-prandial visual analogue scales assessing hunger, fullness, and flavour desires (sweet, salty, savoury and fatty) were additionally completed. Blood samples were taken the previous day before the hydration interventions in a euhydrated state, and in the fasted and post-prandial state during HYPO and EUHY.HYPO induced -1.9 ± 1. % body mass change, compared to -0. ± 0.6 % , with accompanying changes in markers of hypohydration which were not seen during EUHY. A higher desire for foods was associated with a higher water content but the association was weaker in EUHY compared to HYPO, (β = -0.33 mm/g of food water content, p < 0.001) in the food reward task. Visual analogue scales showed similar hunger and fullness between interventions, but during HYPO there was consistently higher thirst (average range in difference 27-32 mm across all time points) and lower fasted desire for salt (-23, 95 % CI -10, -35 mm). Ad libitum  intake (HYPO 1953 ± 742 kJ, EUHY 2027 ± 926 kJ; p = 0.542) and post-prandial ghrelin concentrations (HYPO 180 ± 65 pg∙mL, EUHY 188 ± 71 pg∙mL; p = 0.736) were similar by hydration status.An acute manipulation to hydration status altered desire for salt and foods of differing water contents, but did not influence  intake at an ad libitum pasta meal. Further research should investigate whether these appetites would alter food choice.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we construct ionic liquid filled the nanoslits of laminated graphene oxide membrane with silver ions as carrier to separate ethylene/ethane. The nanoslits of graphene oxide membrane efficiently prevents the loss of silver ions ionic liquid solution. The ionic liquid further slows down the reduction of silver ions. The membrane with silver concentration of 0.25 M shows the best performance with selectivity of 54 for ethylene/ethane and ethylene permeance of .9 GPU. This performance is superior to other silver ions ionic liquid solution membranes and competitive in the reported facilitated transport membranes.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678670>Simultaneous determination of multiclass illegal dyes with different acidic-basic properties in foodstuffs by LC-MS/MS via polarity switching mode.</a></h1><p>Simultaneous determination of multiclass illegal dyes possessing different chemical properties is difficult. By using LC-MS/MS via negative/positive ion switching mode, an efficient and fast multi-residual method for simultaneous determination of multiclass 52 illegal dyes with different acidic-basic properties in foodstuffs was developed and validated during one single run, including 23 fat-soluble neutral azo dyes, 8 acidic sulfonated azo dyes, 12 triphenylmethane basic dyes, three basic indole dyes, three xanthene dyes, one quinoline dye, and two anthraquinones dyes. The illegal dyes were extracted with methanol-acetonitrile and further purified with d-SPE procedure to reduce interference. Sample dilution with 100-fold was used for the elimination of matrix effects of the quantitation of LC-MS/MS analysis. Validation data showed the good recoveries in the range of 71.-111.%, with relative standard deviations less than 20%, suggesting the developed method is suitable for the identification and quantitation of multiclass illegal dyes at trace levels in foods.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of AGP on feed intake and rectal temperature in sheep. Ewes were ovariectomized, implanted with a cannula into a lateral ventricle of the brain, and kept indoors in individual pens. Feed intake and rectal temperature was determined for sheep in all experiments. In the first experiment, ewes (n = 4) received 1 of 4 treatments [0 (control), 0.012 (low), 0.06 (medium), or 0.30 (high) mg / kg BW AGP] into the lateral ventricle (ICV). All sheep received all treatments in a Latin square design balanced for carryover effects with 10 d between treatments. In the second experiment, ewes (n = 10) received one of two treatments (0 and 3 mg / kg BW of AGP) intravenously (IV) in a completely randomized design. In the third experiment, ewes (n = 19) received peripheral treatments (IV) of an antipyretic [0 (control) or . mg / kg BW flunixin meglumine (FLU)] 30 minutes before receiving central AGP [0 (control) or 0.3 mg / kg BW of AGP] in a completely randomized design. All data were analyzed using a mixed model analysis of variance and tested for effects of treatment, time, and the interaction of treatment and time. Cumulative 48-h feed intake after administration of treatments was also determined. In the first experiment there was no effect of ICV treatment (P = 0.37) on feed intake rate or on cumulative feed intake (P = 0.31). There was an effect of ICV treatment (P = 0.002) on rectal temperatures, which were greater (P < 0.05) after the high dose of centrally administered AGP. In the second experiment there was no effect of AGP administration IV on feed intake rate (P = 0.98), on cumulative feed intake (P = 0.41) or on rectal temperature (P = 0.71). In the third experiment there was an effect of central AGP treatment (P < 0.0001) and an interaction of central AGP and time (P < 0.0001) on rectal temperature, whereas FLU had no effect (P = 0.93), demonstrating that AGP increased rectal temperatures regardless of antipyretic treatment. These results indicate that central AGP increases rectal temperature in sheep by pathways that do not involve prostaglandins. Further research is needed to determine if AGP may be an important integrator of  balance and inflammation.© The Author(s) 2019.

This study makes use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to 1) examine differences in the contextual factors, including location, food preparation style, people present, presence of media devices, and overall atmosphere, between meal and snack occasions; and ) explore differences in the context of snacking occasions across children's gender and weight status. Data for the current study came from the Family Matters Study, which included 150 families with children aged 5-7 years old (n = 25 from each of the following groups: Black/African American, Hispanic, Hmong, Native American, Somali, White). Parents completed an 8-day EMA observation period, during which they were surveyed after each eating occasion with the study child; questions explored contextual factors including location, food preparation style, people present, presence of media devices, and the overall atmosphere of each eating occasion. Differences between meals and snacks were observed; a smaller percentage of snacks (compared to meals) were prepared by the parent, consisted of only homemade food, and were planned ahead of time, as opposed to being served in response to a child's request. Snacks were more likely than other meals to be eaten on the couch and in the presence of a screen. Furthermore, important differences in snacking context were observed by child gender and weight status. Findings illuminate opportunities to improve children's overall dietary intake via interventions focused on improving the quality of foods served during snacks, as well as the contextual environment in which snacks are eaten.Copyright © 2019.

Combining Pt with transition metals and reducing the particle size of Pt-based catalysts are two effective strategies to improve their performances toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, one-dimensional nanostructures with interconnected porous texture are ideal supports in electrocatalysis. Herein, ZIF-67 were embedded into electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to obtain hierarchical porous carbon nanofibers which were used as supports to anchor sub-5 nm octahedral Pt-Cu nanocrystals. The as-prepared nanocomposites exhibit outstanding HER performance in acidic medium with an overpotential of only 13 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm and superior stability over 10,000 cycles. This outperforms commercial Pt/C and most supported catalysts reported so far. The remarkable HER properties may be mainly attributed to the unique structures of nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanofibers and Pt-Cu nanocrystals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the slow mass transfer and poor product quality limit its development. In this study, the effects of temperature, hydrogen/carbon monoxide (H/CO) ratio and trace element addition on simulated syngas biomethanation were investigated in three batches of experiments. Results showed that (1) the temperature influenced little on the quality of produced biogas; () the methane content in the biogas production were 66.37 ± 4.04%, 70.61 ± 6.06% and 73.35 ± .39% respectively with the H/CO ratio of 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1; (3) after the addition of Fe, Co and Ni elements, the biogas quality was significantly improved (methane content was 79.76 ± 7.35%), but the microbial community structure did not change. This experiment provided a guidance for improving the biogas production performance of syngas biomethanation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As has been shown in our previous papers, electrochemical treatment has the potential to achieve this goal. However, the adoption of electrochemical approach is limited by its high  consumption. Here, we investigate the possibility of electrochemical phosphorus removal at extremely low current density using graphite felt as the cathode. We found a current density as low as 0.04 A/m can enhance the removal of phosphate in our electrochemical system. The removal of phosphate at extremely low current density resulted from electrochemical induced calcium phosphate precipitation and not by electrochemical adsorption. Electrochemical treatment of real domestic wastewater at 0. A/m almost eliminates the precipitation of Mg(OH) and limits the formation of CaCO. The recovered precipitates are dominated by calcium phosphate (59%), followed by 35% CaCO and 6% Mg(OH). The specific  consumption of this newly electrochemical system is between 4.4 and 26.4 kW h/kg P, which is  orders of magnitude lower than our previous system (110-2238 kW h/kg P). Key factors for this improvement prove to be enlarged precipitation area and hydroxide flux retardation by graphite felt. Practically, our study offers a potential way to reduce the  consumption in electrochemical removal of phosphate by using a graphite felt cathode and at a current density below 0. A/m. Fundamentally, our study contributes to the understanding of adsorption and precipitation in electrochemical removal of phosphate at an extremely low current density and with carbon-based electrodes.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Given that CMS-induced depressive behavior was previously related to impaired hippocampal  metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction, our current study aimed to investigate the interplay between toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivators-1-alpha (PGC1-α) as a physiological regulator of  metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis in the combined LPS/CMS model.Male Wistar rats were exposed to either LPS (50 μg/kg i.p.) over  weeks, CMS protocol for 4 weeks or LPS over  weeks followed by 4 weeks of CMS (LPS/CMS). Three additional groups of rats were exposed to LPS/CMS protocol and treated with either pentoxifylline (PTX), fluoxetine (FLX) or a combination of both. Rats were examined for behavioral, neurochemical, gene expression and mitochondrial ultra-structural changes.LPS/CMS increased the expression of TLR4 and its downstream players; MyD88, NFκB and TNF-α along with an escalation in hippocampal- metabolism and p-AMPK. Simultaneously LPS/CMS attenuated the expression of PGC1-α/NRF1/Tfam and mt-DNA. The antidepressant (AD) 'FLX', the TNF-α inhibitor 'PTX' and their combination ameliorated the LPS/CMS-induced changes. Interestingly, all the aforementioned changes induced by the LPS/CMS combined model were significantly less than those induced by CMS alone.Blocking the TLR4/NFκB signaling enhanced the activation of the PGC1-α/NRF1/Tfam and mt-DNA content independent on the activation of the -sensing kinase AMPK.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, insulin, and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every  weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by .3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.5% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient. Compared to baseline, insulin decreased by 18%, but the change in glucose was not clinically significant. Other blood safety markers were within their reference ranges, and there were no adverse events.  and  mRNA expression was reduced by inhibitors of PPAR and PPAR, but there was no effect of PKA or PKG inhibition. We conclude that naringenin supplementation is safe in humans, reduces body weight and insulin resistance, and increases metabolic rate by PPAR and PPAR activation. The effects of naringenin on  expenditure and insulin sensitivity warrant investigation in a randomized controlled clinical trial.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668919>Tristetraprolin posttranscriptionally downregulates PFKFB3 in cancer cells.</a></h1><p>The enzyme 6-phosphofructo--kinase/fructose-,6-bisphosphatases 3 (PFKFB3) catalyzes the first committed rate-limiting step of glycolysis and is upregulated in cancer cells. The mechanism of PFKFB3 expression upregulation in cancer cells has not been fully elucidated. The PFKFB3 3'-UTR is reported to contain AU-rich elements (AREs) that are important for regulating PFKFB3 mRNA stability. However, the mechanisms by which PFKFB3 mRNA stability is determined by its 3'-UTR are not well known. We demonstrated that tristetraprolin (TTP), an ARE-binding protein, has a critical function regulating PFKFB3 mRNA stability. Our results showed that PFKFB3 mRNA contains three AREs in the 3'-UTR. TTP bound to the 3rd ARE and enhanced the decay of PFKFB3 mRNA. Overexpression of TTP decreased PFKFB3 expression and ATP levels but increased GSH level in cancer cells. Overexpression of PFKFB3 cDNA without the 3'-UTR rescued ATP level and GSH level in TTP-overexpressing cells. Our results suggested that TTP post-transcriptionally downregulated PFKFB3 expression and that overexpression of TTP may contribute to suppression of glycolysis and  production of cancer cells in part by downregulating PFKFB3 expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this contribution, four 'T'-shaped molecules bearing the ,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) skeleton, named 5 a-5 d, were prepared and characterized.

Although "La Purísima" Water Reservoir is an important source for multiple activities (e.g. recreational, fishing and agricultural) in Guanajuato state, it has been receiving for the last centuries a high load of pollutants by mining extraction, urbanization and land-use change from the Guanajuato Hydrological Basin. The analyses of environmental magnetism, geochemistry, X-ray  dispersive spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and multivariate methods were applied to study sediments from the reservoir and basin. Accordingly, they indicate the presence of iron oxides (magnetite and hematite) and iron sulfides (pyrite and greigite), which evidences relevant differences in particle size and concentration within the water reservoir (median mass-specific magnetic susceptibility χ = 23. × 10 m/kg), as well as with respect to the river basin sediments (median χ = 88.8 × 10 m/kg). The highest enrichment factor EF values (median values of EF = -10 for As, Co, Ba, Cu, Cd, Ni and EF > 20 for S) are mainly associated with historical mining activities that have led to an enrichment of potentially toxic elements on these water reservoir sediments. We propose the use of concentration and grain size dependent magnetic parameters, i.e. χ, remanent magnetizations and anhysteretic ratios ARM/SIRM and χ/χ, as proxies for Ba, Co, Cr, Ni, P and Pb pollution in these river and water reservoir sediments. Such parameters allow to evaluate this sedimentary environment, and similar ones, through useful and convenient proxies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The various factor, including precursors, reaction time and power of sonication can affect the shape, size, and purity of the samples. We utilized X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray  dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to characterize the BaMnO nanostructures. The optical property of BaMnO nanostructures was explored by Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and the  gap was suitable for catalytic activity (about .75 eV). Changing the precursor can affect the size, nanoparticle shape, architectures, and uniformity of the samples. We employed the BaMnO nanostructures for O evolution reaction as catalysts. It can observe that increasing the homogeneity of the catalysts can increase the efficiency of the Oxygen evolution reaction. The maximum amount of the O evolution and the highest TOF and TON are related to nanoplate disc using barium salicylate as a precursor of barium. As a result, we can nominate the BaMnO nanostructures as an effective and novel catalyst for water-splitting reaction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Present study has been conducted in a part of Indus basin to investigate the presence and spatial distribution of arsenic (As) and other trace metals in groundwater. The As concentration varies from bdl-255.6 μg/L and 24.6% of the 73 collected groundwater samples have As above world health organization (WHO) guideline of 10 μg/L. High concentration of As is found along the newer alluvium of Ravi River. As is found with high bicarbonate (HCO) and Iron (Fe) and low nitrate (NO) indicating reductive dissolution of Fe bearing minerals. However, silicate weathering along with high sulphate (SO) and positive oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) indicates mixed redox conditions. Weathering of minerals along with other major hydrogeochemical process are responsible for composition of groundwater. With 31.5% of the samples, sodium bicarbonate (Na-HCO) is the major water facies followed by magnesium bicarbonate (Mg-HCO) in 30% of samples. As, Fe and other trace metals including copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn) were used to calculate the health risk for children and adults in the region. Out of 73 samples, 58% has high Fe, 32.8% has high Zn, and 4.1% has high Cd which are above the prescribed limits of WHO guidelines. Health risk of the population has been assessed using chronic dose index (CDI), hazardous quotients (HQ) and hazardous index (HI) for children and adults. The mean CDI values follows the order as Fe > Zn > Cu > As > Cr > Cd, while the HQ values indicates high As hazards for both children and adults. 43.8% of the groundwater samples have high HI for adults, however, 49.3% has high HI for children indicating higher risk for children compared to adults. A large-scale testing should be prioritized to test the wells for As and other trace metals in the study region to reduce health risks.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It was observed that compounds  and 12 had the lowest IC and the highest cytotoxic effects against all tested cell lines. As attempt to explain the cytotoxic activity achieved by the tested compounds in the in vitro study, molecular simulation was done to reveal the activity of the tested compounds against four different proteins (CDK2, CYP19, JAK2, and BCL2) which are highly implicated in cancer regulation and progression. We found that compound , and 12 were the best docked compounds against all tested receptors, which was indicated by lowest binding  compared to reference ligand. Interestingly enough, our molecular study was in agreement with the cytotoxic activity.

A total of 33 sorghum samples from all over China were used in this study. The samples were scanned for their spectra in the range of 12,000-4,000 cm-1. Based on principal components analysis of the spectra, the samples were split into a calibration set (n = 24) and a validation set (n = 9) according to the ratio of 3: 1. With animal experiment values as calibration reference, the calibration models of DE and ME were established using partial least squares regression algorithm. Different spectral pretreatments were applied on the spectra to reduce the noise level. The best wavenumber ranges were also investigated. Results showed that DE and ME content in sorghum fed to growing pigs ranged from 14.57-16.70 MJ/kg DM and 14.31-16.35 MJ/kg DM, respectively. The optimal spectral preprocessing method for DE and ME was the combination of first derivative and multiplicative scatter correction. The most informative near-infrared spectral regions were 9,403.9-6,094.4 cm-1 and 4,605.5-4,242.9 cm-1 for DE and ME. The best performance for DE and ME calibration models was the coefficient of determination of calibration (R2c) of 0.94 and 0.93, coefficient of determination of cross-external validation (R2cv) of 0.88 and 0.86, residual predictive deviation of cross-external validation (RPDcv) of .86 and .64, coefficient of determination of external validation (R2v) of 0.90 and 0.81, and residual predictive deviation of external validation (RPDv) of 3.15 and .35, respectively. There were no significant differences between the measured and NIRS predicted values for DE and ME (P = 0.895 for DE and P = 0.644 for ME). As the number of calibration samples increased from 24 to 33, the calibration performance of DE and ME models was improved, indicated by increased R2c, R2cv, and RPDcv values. In conclusion, NIRS quantitative models of the available  in sorghum were established in this study. The results demonstrated that the content of DE and ME in sorghum could be predicted with relatively high accuracy based on NIRS and NIRS showed the superiority of speediness and practicality when compared with previous research methods including animal experiments, regression equations, and computer-controlled simulated digestion system.© The Author(s) 2019.

In this study, a new biotechnical process for converting the WAS alkaline fermentation liquor (WASAFL) into valuable, easy-separated medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) through chain elongation (CE) was investigated, which may provide a new insight into sludge treatment. In the process, ethanol was served as the electron donor (EDs) and WASAFL were main electron acceptors (EAs). The MCFAs productions were investigated under three different ED to EA ratios (i.e., 1:, 1:1 and :1). The result showed that MCFAs production was increased from .88 ± 0.01 to 5.28 ± 0.18 g COD/L with the increase of ED to EA ratio. However, the highest MCFA selectivity was achieved at 72.9% when the ED to EA ratio was 1:1. The decrease in the selectivity at high ED:EA ratio is mainly due to the production of higher alcohol (i.e., n-butanol and n-hexanol). The thermodynamic analysis confirmed all CE processes for MCFAs production from WASAFL were exothermic reactions, with the spontaneity and  release of the reactions increased with the ethanol level. The microbial community analysis showed that the relative abundances of Clostridium, Oscillibacter, Leptolinea and Exilispira were positively correlated with the MCFAs production. The metagenomic analysis suggested that both the reverse β-oxidization pathway and fatty acid biosynthesis pathway contributed to the CE process in the studied system. The functional enzymes were mainly associated within Clostridium, with Clostridium Kluyveri, Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium magnum being likely the key species responsible for the CE process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study is to compare the effect on post-surgical oedema after mandibular orthognathic surgery, between two different laser power densities and oral medication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory.In a randomized clinical trial, on 60 patients who were subject to mandibular orthognathic surgery were divided into three groups. All groups received sodium naproxen 250mg every 8hours for 6days. Two groups were irradiated with two different laser application protocols and the other was a control group. In G1 group the irradiation parameters three times per week for two weeks were: 940nm, in continuous mode, .5W, 120s, 85.71J/cm, 0.89W/cm, over the right and left side with a distance from the skin surface of 1mm with the whitening handpiece (spot size of .8cm). In G2, the irradiation parameters three times a week for two weeks were: 940nm, in continuous mode, 4.1W, 120s, 68.33J/cm, 0.58W/cm over the right and left side with a distance from the skin surface of 15mm, with the deep tissue handpiece (spot size of 7.1cm). In all the groups, millimetric facial measurements were taken from tragus to lateral commissure, and from lateral commissure to gonion in both sides.All differences between T1 and T6 were significant for the three groups, (paired T, P<0.05). The differences between the groups were generally not significant (P>0.05) except for commissure - right and left gonion when compared G1 vs CG (P<0.05) and G2 vs CG (P<0.05). Initial changes (T1-T2) between groups were significantly different except for the measurement from commissure to right tragus G1 vs CG (P=0.411) and from commissure to left tragus G2 vs CG (P=0.94). The faster resolution of the oedema occurred in G2 group.

In this work, a "hierarchically porous carbon (HPC)-supporting" approach was developed to synthesize highly ORR active Fe-phenanthroline (Fe-phen) derived Fe-N  -C catalysts. Compared to commercial carbon black supports, utilizing HPCs as carbon supports can not only prevent the formation of inactive iron nanoparticles during pyrolysis but also optimize the porous morphology of the catalysts, which eventually increases the amount of reactant-accessible and atomically dispersed Fe-N  active sites. The prepared catalyst therefore exhibits a remarkable ORR activity in both half-cells (half-wave potential of 0.80 V in 0.5 M HSO) and H-air PEMFCs (442 mA cm at a working voltage of 0.6 V), making it among the best non-PGM catalysts for PEMFCs.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671246>Metal-free Photocatalytic Synthesis of exo-Iodomethylene -Oxazolidinones: An Alternative Strategy for CO2 Valorization with Solar .</a></h1><p>A visible-light-promoted metal-free carboxylative cyclization of propargylic amines with CO2 is described to offer exo-iodomethylene -oxazolidinones.

Cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase and type- NADH dehydrogenase (NDH-) are respiratory chain components predicted to be essential, and are currently targeted for drug development. Here we demonstrate that an Mtb cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase deletion mutant is viable and only partially attenuated in mice. Moreover, treatment of Mtb-infected marmosets with a cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase inhibitor controls disease progression and reduces lesion-associated inflammation, but most lesions become cavitary. Deletion of both NDH- encoding genes (Δndh- mutant) reveals that the essentiality of NDH- as shown in standard growth media is due to the presence of fatty acids. The Δndh- mutant is only mildly attenuated in mice and not differently susceptible to clofazimine, a drug in clinical use proposed to engage NDH-.

Despite the critical role of the taste system in determining food selection and consumption, the effects of chronic sucrose consumption on the peripheral taste system in mammals have received limited attention. We offered female Sprague Dawley rats free access to water and one of three diets for up to 40 days: (1) sucrose-free chow or "NS" diet; () a high-sucrose dry diet or "HS"; or (3) 30% sucrose solution and the NS diet, designated "LiqS" diet. Sucrose consumption by LiqS rats gradually increased and by day 14 was equal to that of HS rats. Food intake decreased in LiqS rats, but their  intake remained higher than for NS or HS rats. There was no significant difference in weight gain of the groups during the study. Recordings from the chorda tympani nerve (CT), which innervates taste buds on the anterior tongue, revealed decreased responses to 1 M sucrose in both LiqS and HS rats and to acesulfame K and salt tastants in LiqS rats after 40 days on diet. Umami, bitter, and acid response magnitudes were unchanged in both groups. These results demonstrate that chronic sucrose exposure inhibits taste responses to higher concentrations of sweet stimuli. More surprisingly, CT responses to NaCl and 0.5M NaAc were significantly reduced in rats on the LiqS diet. Thus, the physical form of the diet influences taste responsiveness to salt and sweet taste function. These data suggest that taste buds are previously unappreciated targets of chronic sucrose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

However, it is extremely challenging to increase membrane water flux and simultaneously achieve high rejection rates of cations or organic dyes. Herein, we report a tannic acid (TA) assisted exfoliation method to fabricate TA-modified MoS (TAMoS) nanosheets with high production yield (90 ± 5%). The TAMoS nanosheets membranes show excellent non-swelling stability in water. It is found that a hybrid membrane with 1 wt% of TAMoS in MoS nanosheets demonstrates overall better performance than pure MoS and TAMoS membrane. Such a hybrid membrane with a thickness of 5 µm shows fast water flux at around 32 L m h (LMH) and >97% rejection of various cations under static diffusion mode. Under vacuum-driven filtration condition, the as-prepared hybrid membrane demonstrates ultrafast water flux of 15,000 ± 100 L/(m h bar) and 99.87 ± 0.1% rejection of multiple model organic dyes. To the best of our knowledge, the above performances are superior to those of all MoS-based membranes reported previously in terms of water flux and ion/dye rejection.

In the present study Au/Pd bimetallic alloyed nanoparticles were effectively decorated on mesoporous silica modified g-CN (graphitic carbon nitride) nanosheets by a simple one-pot calcinations strategy. The formation of Au/Pd alloyed nanoparticles has been supported by XRD, UV-vis DRS, TEM and XPS studies. The photocatalytic performance of the photocatalysts were investigated by performing tandem reaction for simultaneous oxidation of phenol and reduction of Cr (VI). The photocatalytic performances were found to be significant for either single phenol species or single Cr (VI), but quite appreciable photocatalytic performance was observed for a solution containing Cr (VI)-phenol mixture. The synergetic effect of Au/Pd alloyed nanoparticle and enhanced photocurrent (1.4 mA/cm) generated by the nano-composite further supports the activity. The results of tandem reaction not only reveals the feasibility of carrying out degradation of two important pollutants simultaneously from waste water, but also gives us an enlightenment to efficiently degrade mixture of pollutants without using any additional chemical as trapping agent in the photocatalytic process.Copyright © 2019.

Herein, Prussian blue analogues (PBA) anchored on CdS nanorods (CdS NRs) pre-coated with polydopamine (PDA) are utilized as precursors to prepare ultrafine CoS nanoparticles supported on N, S-codoped CNTs (CoS@N,S-CNT), where CdS NRs are served as sulfur sources and hard templates. After pyrolysis, the resulting CoS@N,S-CNT-800 shows a high specific surface area of 142.4 m g, together with merely 0.780 V difference between the OER potential at 10 mA cm and the ORR potential at 3 mA cm. The CoS@N,S-CNT-800 based air cathode displays a higher discharge capacity of 787 mAh g at 10 mA cm, a higher output power density of 154 mW cm, better working stability, as well as a lower charge-discharge voltage gap than the Pt/C + RuO based air electrode at various working current density. The remarkable oxygen reversible catalytic activities are mainly attributed to the presence of a thin layer of mesoporous carbon on partial sections of the open-end N,S-CNTs, which not only shortens the mass diffusion length but also prevents N,S-CNTs from excessively bundling to maximize the exposure of CoS nanocrystallites and graphitized carbon skeletons with N or S heteroatoms.Copyright © 2019.

Our recent study showed crucial role of adiponectin in the regulation of testicular functions, and the circulating level of adiponectin declines in diabetes. The current study thus aimed to examine the efficacy of adiponectin in improving testicular dysfunction in high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced T2D mice. T2D was induced in pre-pubertal mice fed with high-fat diet for ∼10 weeks followed by single treatment of streptozotocin. T2D mice showed presence of increased body mass, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, increased oxidative stress, and declined serum testosterone compared to vehicle-treated control mice. The spermatogenic, steroidogenic, metabolic, and antioxidative parameters were evaluated in T2D mice treated with adiponectin for both two and four weeks. The exogenous administration of adiponectin to T2D mice showed enhanced serum testosterone and expression of testicular steroidogenic markers proteins, insulin receptor and GLUT8 proteins, increase in intra-testicular concentrations of glucose and lactate and activity of LDH and antioxidant enzymes compared to the levels in untreated T2D mice. This suggests that treatment of adiponectin effectively improves testicular functions by increasing expression of insulin receptor-mediated increased transport of  substrate (glucose and lactate) and a marked reduction in oxidative stress are the possible mechanism by which adiponectin effectively improves testicular function in T2D mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

In order to evaluate its feasibility for wetland plants treatment, hydrochars from different wetland plants were produced at different temperatures (200 °C, 220 °C, 240 °C, and 260 °C) and characterized, and the transformation of P was investigated. In comparison with wetland plant derived biochars, the derived hydrochars had a moderate pH (5.0-7.7), more oxygen-containing groups, and higher  density (18.0-27.1 MJ kg). These properties were affected by hydrothermal temperature and feedstock choice. In contrast to high water-soluble P in biomass (71.0-73.% of total P), more recalcitrant P species formed in hydrochars, implying that HTC treatment could achieve P immobilization and reduce P leaching loss. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results indicated that monoester-P and soluble orthophosphate were transformed to insoluble orthophosphate during the HTC treatment.

The splicing switch from normal PKM1 to cancer-specific PKM2 isoform allows the cancer cells to meet their  and biosynthetic demands, thereby facilitating the cancer cells growth. We have investigated the largely unexplored epigenetic mechanism of PKM splicing switch in head and neck cancer (HNC) cells. Considering the reversible nature of epigenetic marks, we have also examined the utility of dietary-phytochemical in reverting the splicing switch from PKM2 to PKM1 isoform and thereby inhibition of HNC tumorigenesis.We present HNC-patients samples, showing the splicing-switch from PKM1-isoform to PKM2-isoform analyzed via immunoblotting and qRT-PCR. We performed methylated-DNA-immunoprecipitation to examine the DNA methylation level and chromatin-immunoprecipitation to assess the BORIS (Brother of Regulator of Imprinted Sites) recruitment and polII enrichment. The effect of dietary-phytochemical on the activity of denovo-DNA-methyltransferase-3b (DNMT3B) was detected by DNA-methyltransferase-activity assay. We also analyzed the Warburg effect and growth inhibition using lactate, glucose uptake assay, invasion assay, cell proliferation, and apoptosis assay. The global change in transcriptome upon dietary-phytochemical treatment was assayed using Human Transcriptome Array .0 (HTA2.0).Here, we report the role of DNA-methylation mediated recruitment of the BORIS at exon-10 of PKM-gene regulating the alternative-splicing to generate the PKM2-splice-isoform in HNC. Notably, the reversal of Warburg effect was achieved by employing a dietary-phytochemical, which inhibits the DNMT3B, resulting in the reduced DNA-methylation at exon-10 and hence, PKM-splicing switch from cancer-specific PKM2 to normal PKM1. Global-transcriptome-analysis of dietary-phytochemical-treated cells revealed its effect on alternative splicing of various genes involved in HNC.This study identifies the epigenetic mechanism of PKM-splicing switch in HNC and reports the role of dietary-phytochemical in reverting the splicing switch from cancer-specific PKM2 to normal PKM1-isoform and hence the reduced Warburg effect and growth inhibition of HNC.

After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with  metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner. Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis implied that changes of serum profile have potential correlation with alterations of fecal microbiota and their metabolites SCFAs in acute HS-treated grow-finishing pigs.Metabolism disorders caused by 24-h acute HS associated with changes of fecal microbiota and their metabolites SCFAs with a FI-independent manner in grow-finishing pigs.These results give us a new insight of the intestinal damage caused by acute HS and the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674607>A water-stable zinc(ii)-organic framework as a multiresponsive luminescent sensor for toxic heavy metal cations, oxyanions and organochlorine pesticides in aqueous solution.</a></h1><p>A novel metal-organic framework with the formula [Zn3(DDB)(DPE)]·H2O (1) (H5DDB = 3,5-di(',4'-dicarboxylphenyl)benzoic acid and DPE = 1,-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene) has been solvothermally synthesized by employing a rigid carboxylate ligand H5DDB to assemble with Zn(ii) ions in the presence of a flexible bis(pyridyl) linker DPE. The Zn-MOF is a 3D framework with six-nuclear clusters and possesses remarkable water stability and pH stability. Interestingly, complex 1 can sensitively and selectively sense Fe(iii), Cr(iii), Cr(vi), Mn(vii) and the pesticide ,6-Dich-4-NA with low detection limits in aqueous solution. Moreover, complex 1 also exhibits selectivity for ,6-Dich-4-NA detection in real samples including carrot, grape and nectarine extracts, and its detection ability is almost unchanged in the presence of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The possible mechanisms of luminescence quenching have been explained by the weak affinity of nitrogen atoms, resonance  transfer, and photoinduced electron transfer. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a MOF-based multiresponsive fluorescent probe for the simultaneous detection of Fe(iii), Cr(iii/vi), Mn(vii) and the pesticide ,6-Dich-4-NA in aqueous solution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673197>Periphytic algae decouple fungal activity from leaf litter decomposition via negative priming.</a></h1><p>1. Well-documented in terrestrial settings, priming effects describe stimulated heterotrophic microbial activity and decomposition of recalcitrant carbon by additions of labile carbon. In aquatic settings, algae produce labile exudates which may elicit priming during organic matter decomposition, yet the directions and mechanisms of aquatic priming effects remain poorly tested. . We tested algal-induced priming during decomposition of two leaf species of contrasting recalcitrance,  and , in experimental streams under light or dark conditions. We measured litter-associated algal, bacterial, and fungal biomass and activity, stoichiometry, and litter decomposition rates over 43 days. 3. Light increased algal biomass and production rates and increased bacterial abundance 141-733% and fungal production rates 20-157%. Incubations with a photosynthesis inhibitor established that algal activity directly stimulated fungal production rates in the short-term. 4. Algal-stimulated fungal production rates on both leaf species were not coupled to long-term increases in fungal biomass accrual or litter decomposition rates, which were 154-157% and 164-455% greater in the dark, respectively. The similar patterns on fast- vs. slow-decomposing  and , respectively, indicated that substrate recalcitrance may not mediate priming strength or direction. 5. In this example of negative priming, periphytic algae decoupled fungal activity from decomposition, likely by providing labile carbon invested toward greater fungal growth and reproduction instead of recalcitrant carbon degradation. If common, algal-induced negative priming could stimulate heterotrophy reliant on labile carbon yet suppress decomposition of recalcitrant carbon, modifying  and nutrients available to upper trophic levels and enhancing organic carbon storage or export in well-lit aquatic habitats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673020>3D Porous Graphene Based Aerogel for Electromagnetic Applications.</a></h1><p>Lightweight multifunctional electromagnetic (EM) absorbing materials with outstanding thermal properties, chemical resistance and mechanical stability are crucial for space, aerospace and electronic devices and packaging. Therefore, 3D porous graphene aerogels are attracting ever growing interest. In this paper we present a cost effective lightweight 3D porous graphene-based aerogel for EM wave absorption, constituted by a poly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer matrix filled with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and we show that the thermal, electrical, mechanical properties of the aerogel can be tuned through the proper selection of the processing temperature, controlled either at 65 °C or 85 °C. The produced GNP-filled aerogels are characterized by exceptional EM properties, allowing the production of absorbers with 9. GHz and 6.4 GHz qualified bandwidths with reflection coefficients below -10 dB and -20 dB, respectively. Moreover, such aerogels show exceptional thermal conductivities without any appreciable volume change after temperature variations. Finally, depending on the process parameters, it is shown the possibility to obtain water repellent aerogel composites, thus preventing their EM and thermal properties from being affected by environmental humidity and allowing the realization of EM absorber with a stable response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671637>Insights into the Interaction Mechanisms of the Proviral Integration Site of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (Pim) Kinases with Pan-Pim Inhibitors PIM447 and AZD1208: A Molecular Dynamics Simulation and MM/GBSA Calculation Study.</a></h1><p>Based on the up-regulation of the proviral integration site of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Pim) kinase family (Pim1, , and 3) observed in several types of leukemias and lymphomas, the development of pan-Pim inhibitors is an attractive therapeutic strategy. While only PIM447 and AZD1208 have entered the clinical stages. To elucidate the interaction mechanisms of three Pim kinases with PIM447 and AZD1208, six Pim/ligand systems were studied by homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding free  calculation. The residues of the top group (Leu44, Val52, Ala65, Lys67, and Leu120 in Pim1) dominated the pan-Pim inhibitors binding to Pim kinases. The residues of the bottom group (Gln127, Asp128, and Leu174 in Pim1) were crucial for Pims/PIM447 systems, while the contributions of these residues were decreased sharply for Pims/AZD1208 systems. It is likely that the more potent pan-Pim inhibitors should be bound strongly to the top and bottom groups. The residues of the left, right and loop groups were located in the loop regions of the binding pocket, however, the flexibility of these regions triggered the protein interacting with diverse pan-Pim inhibitors efficiently. We hope this work can provide valuable information for the design of novel pan-Pim inhibitors in the future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679243>Proof of Concept for a Universal Identification System for Medical Devices.</a></h1><p>Medical devices need a unified way of accessing information that uniquely identifies them. This can provide traceability to specifications, lot numbers, recalls, and the like. Such a system would have applications for devices both in and out of the body. Common barcodes, such as a UPC code, can only be read in plain sight, when nothing comes between the scanner and the code. UPC coding is not suitable for all medical devices because some are implanted in the body or are otherwise inaccessible without invasive techniques. This article demonstrates a proof of concept for XRF coding on devices. Material codes were made and read externally by an XRF reader. The reading showed trace amounts of the chemicals that compose the medical device in the background signal. The  levels of the chemicals were assigned values to build a readable code correlated with information about the medical device it is attached to. Attachment can be made during material synthesis, part or product manufacture, or even after final assembly. The technique demonstrated here is a promising concept for the future of medical device detection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680355></a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675874>Synthesis and optical properties of colloidal CsAgSbBiCl double perovskite nanocrystals.</a></h1><p>Lead halide perovskites are extraordinary optoelectronic materials, but there are issues related to their toxicity and instability. To overcome these issues, various lead-free perovskites are being explored. Metal halide double perovskites, for example, CsAgSbCl, in which two Pb in CsPbCl (or CsPbCl) are replaced with one Ag and one Sb, provide both charge balanced and stable 3D perovskite structures. Synthesis of such double perovskites with different compositions, sizes, and solution processabilities still remains a challenge. The present communication describes synthesis and characterization of colloidal CsAgSbBiCl alloy nanocrystals with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. These nanocrystals exhibit an elpasolite structure where the lattice parameters vary systematically with the composition "x." The nanocrystals are cubic in shape with an edge-length of ∼10 nm. UV-visible absorption spectra also change systematically with composition. The lowest  absorption peak ∼3.4 eV becomes sharper along with a red-shift with increasing Bi content. The alloying can influence the optical absorption by both modifying the intrinsic electronic band structure and changing the concentration of antisite disorders. For intermediate compositions (x = 0.22, 0.36, and 0.70), photoluminescence with a peak at .74 eV is observed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679097>Denovo designing: a novel signal peptide for tat translocation pathway to transport activin A to the periplasmic space of E. coli.</a></h1><p>The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway is one of the bacterial secretory strategies which exports folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane.In the present study, we designed a novel Tat-signal peptide for secretion of human activin A used as a recombinant protein model here. In doing so, Haloferax volcanii, Halobacterium salinarum, and Escherichia coli Tat specific signal peptides were aligned by ClustalW program to determine conserved and more frequently used residues. After making the initial signal peptide sequence and doing some mutations, efficiency of this designed signal peptide was evaluated using a set of well-known software programs such as TatP, PRED-TAT, and Phobius. Then the best complex between TatC as an initiator protein in Tat secretory machine and the new designed signal peptide connected to activin A with the lowest binding  was constructed by HADDOCK server, and ΔΔG value of - 5.5 kcal/mol was calculated by FoldX module. After that, efficiency of this novel signal peptide for secretion of human activin A to the periplasmic space of E. coli Rosetta-gami (DE3) strain was experimentally evaluated; to scrutinize the activity of the novel signal peptide, Iranian Bacillus Licheniformis α-Amylase enzyme signal peptide as a Sec pathway signal peptide was used as a positive control. The quantitative analysis of western blotting bands by ImageJ software confirmed the high secretion ability of the new designed signal peptide; translocation of 69% of the produced recombinant activin A to the periplasmic space of E. coli. Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy technique also approved the proper secondary structure of activin A secreted to the periplasmic space. The biological activity of activin A was also confirmed by differentiation of K562 erythroleukemia cells to the red blood cell by measuring the amount of hemoglobin or Fe ion using ICP method.In conclusion, this novel designed signal peptide can be used to secrete any other recombinant proteins to the periplasmic space of E. coli efficiently.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669290>The Joint Occurrence of Osteoporosis and Sarcopenia (Osteosarcopenia): Definitions and Characteristics.</a></h1><p>We sought to examine the associations of osteosarcopenia with physical performance, balance, and falls and fractures in community-dwelling older adults. Additionally, we aimed to determine which clinical outcomes are associated with specific components of osteosarcopenia.Cross-sectional study.253 participants (77% women; aged 77.9 ± 0.42 years) who presented for a falls and fractures risk assessment in Melbourne, Australia.Participants were mobile, community-dwelling older adults (≥65 years) free of cognitive impairment. Body composition (via dual- x-ray absorptiometry), physical performance [via Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)], and balance [via Four-Square Step test (FSS) and posturography] were examined. Falls in the past year and fractures in the past 5 years were self-reported. Osteosarcopenia was defined as (1) low bone mineral density (BMD) [T score <-1 standard deviation (SD)] combined with sarcopenia and () osteoporosis (BMD T score ≤-.5 SD) combined with severe sarcopenia. For sarcopenia, we employed the criteria of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP1), the revised criteria (EWGSOP2), and that of the Foundation for the National Institutes for Health (FNIH). Kruskal-Wallis and logistic regression tests were used for statistical analysis.Osteosarcopenia was associated with worse SPPB, TUG, FSS, limit of stability, and falls and fractures history. Additionally, osteosarcopenia (using the severe sarcopenia classification) conferred an increased rate of falls [odds ratios (ORs) from .83 to 3.63; P < .05 for all] and fractures (ORs from 3.86 to 4.38; P < .05 for all) when employing the EWGSOP2 and FNIH definitions, respectively.Compared with the nonosteosarcopenic group, those with osteosarcopenia had greater impairment of physical performance and balance. The EWGSOP2 and FNIH criteria resulted in the strongest associations with physical performance and self-reported falls and fractures.Copyright © 2019 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

Tilt is the subleading degree of freedom after a membrane's geometry, and it becomes relevant at scales comparable to lipid bilayer thickness. Building on earlier work by Hamm and Kozlov [Eur. Phys. J. E 3, 323 (2000)], who envisioned lipid membranes as thin prestressed fluid elastic films, and Terzi and Deserno [J. Chem. Phys. 147, 084702 (2017)], who discovered a new coupling term between splay and tilt divergence, we construct a theory of membrane elasticity that is quadratic in geometry and tilt and complete at order 1/length. We show that a general and consistent treatment of both lateral and transverse depth-dependent shear stresses creates several contributions to the elastic  density, of which only a subset had previously been identified. Apart from the well-known penalty of lipid twist (the curl of tilt), these terms generate no qualitatively new phenomenology, but they quantitatively revise the connections between the moduli of a tilt-curvature theory and its underlying microscopic foundation. In particular, we argue that the monolayer Gaussian curvature modulus κ¯, widely believed to be equal to the second moment of the transmonolayer stress profile, acquires a second contribution from lipid twist, which is always negative. This could resolve the long-standing conundrum that many measured values of κ¯ appeared to have a sign that violates basic stability considerations. We also show that the previously discovered novel coupling between splay and tilt divergence is not simply proportional to κ¯ but acquires its own splay-tilt coupling modulus, κ. We explore the predictions of our theory for various elastic moduli and their mutual interrelations and use an extensive set of existing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations for 12 different lipid types to collectively reason about such predictions. We find that bending rigidities are captured fairly well by existing theories, while reliable predictions for local moduli, especially the splay-tilt coupling modulus, remain challenging.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669253>Bone mineral density at different sites and 5 years mortality in end-stage renal disease patients: A cohort study.</a></h1><p>Bone disease with osteoporosis and renal osteodystrophy is common in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and associates with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and increased morbimortality. We investigated associations of low bone mineral density (BMD) at various bone sites with five year all-cause and CVD mortality in ESRD patients.In a post hoc analysis of 426 ESRD patients (median age 56 years, 62% men) starting dialysis, BMD (whole-body dual- X-ray absorptiometry, DXA), body composition, nutritional status (subjective global assessment, SGA), handgrip strength (%HGS), Framingham CVD risk score (FRS) and biochemical biomarkers of nutrition and inflammation were assessed. We used the Fine and Gray competing risk regression analysis to assess survival analysis.In multivariate logistic regression analysis, %HGS and intact parathyroid hormone associated with low tertile of: BMD, BMD and BMD, after adjusting for FRS, SGA, %HGS, s-albumin, hsCRP, lean body mass index and year of recruitment. Patients with high FRS had low BMD (p < 0.001). Low tertile of BMD (sHR, 1.53), BMD (sHR 1.54) and BMD (sHR 1.60) associated with increased all-cause mortality whereas no such associations were found for the trabecular bone rich sites BMD arm, leg, trunk, rib or spine. Low tertile of BMD (sHR 1.94), BMD (sHR 1.68), BMD (sHR .25) and BMD (sHR .45) associated with increased CVD mortality whereas BMD at other sites did not associate with CVD mortality.Low head and pelvis BMD, and low total BMD, as assessed by whole-body DXA, were independent predictors of increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. Cortical BMD appeared to have stronger association to survival in ESRD than trabecular BMD.Copyright © 2019.

The seed extract contains phytochemical compounds including phenols, terpenoids, and flavonoids that may act as reducing agents and are able to convert metal ions to metal nanoparticles. The formation of synthesized AgNPs was characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and  dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDX). The efficacy of N-AgNPs against human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells was tested. The synthesized AgNPs displayed dose-dependent cytotoxicity (1-200 µg/mL) against MCF-7 cells. Morphological alterations of the cells also appeared as bright field images.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the  status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino acid availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; ) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The TBC has three pre-designed dose regions of proximal, flat-top, and distal components. These components are designed to have nearly equal depth lengths and good linearity. Then, the required SOBP is formed by superposing the TBCs with the correct spacing and beam intensity weights. We then compare the performance of the TBC-based SOBPs with those formed by PBCs.The dose uniformities of the SOBP formed by the proposed method are kept within the design tolerance, and are equivalent to those of conventional SOBPs. The sharpness of the distal falloff is reasonably kept by the deepest TBC. The required number of  layers is significantly reduced compared with that of conventional PBC-based SOBP.The proposed method enables shortening of the irradiation time of spot-scanning proton beam therapy in low- regions with a reduced number of  layers. It can be realized by using only one specially shaped MRF, which can be easily installed at any facility.Copyright © 2019 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A promising approach for an effective anti-inflammatory therapy is the development of inhibitors targeting more than one enzyme of this cascade. Aiming to develop balanced COX/LOX inhibitors; 4-aminosalicylate based thiazolinones having different substituents at the 5th position of the 4-thiazolinone ring (-22) were designed, synthesized, characterized and evaluated in vitro and in vivo for their anti-inflammatory activity. Most of the investigated compounds showed high COX- inhibitory potencies (IC 39-200 nM) with selectivity indexes (30-84). Two compounds, 19 and 21, (IC = 41 and 44 nM), are equipotent to celecoxib (IC = 49 nM), while compound 22 (IC = 39 nM) was the most potent. For 15-LOX, compounds 5, 11, 19, 21 and 22 revealed higher potency (IC 1.5-. µM) than zileuton (IC 15 µM). Thus, compounds 5, 11, 19, 21 and 22 are potent dual inhibitors of COX- and 15-LOX. In vivo anti-inflammatory testing of these compounds revealed that, compounds 5 and 21 had an anti-inflammatory activity similar to indomethacin and celecoxib (% inhibition of oedema = 60 ± 9) and higher than diclofenac potassium (% inhibition = 52 ± 29), while compound 22 (% inhibition = 63 ± 5) was more active than the reference drugs. The results showed that the activity is controlled by the bulkiness and lipophilicity of the substituent at the 5th position. The cytotoxicity results revealed that all compounds are not cytotoxic, additionally, in an experimental model of ulcerogenic effect, the most active compounds 21 and 22 showed better safety profile than indomethacin. Further, at the active sites of the COX-1, COX- and 15-LOX co-crystal, 19, 21, and 22 showed high binding forces in free binding  study, which is consistent with in vitro and in vivo results. In conclusion, these compounds are good candidates for further biological investigation as potential anti-inflammatory drugs with dual balanced inhibition of COX and 15-LOX and good safety profile.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The following steps of the NS-RARP were simulated: bladder neck dissection, seminal vesicle mobilization, nerve-sparing prostatectomy and urethrovesical anastomosis (UVA). Five experts (>500 caseload) and 9 novices (<50 caseload) completed the simulation. Force applied to the NVB during the dissection was quantified by a novel tension wire sensor system fabricated into the NVB. Post-simulation margin status (assessed by induction of chemiluminescent reaction with fluorescent dye mixed into the prostate PVA) and UVA weathertightness (via a standard 180cc leak test) were also assessed. Objective scoring (GEARS and RACE) was performed by  blinded surgeons. GEARS scores were correlated with forces applied to the NVB and RACE scores were correlated with UVA leak rates.Experts achieved faster task specific times for nerve sparing (p= 0.007) and superior margins (p= 0.011). Nerve forces applied were significantly lower for experts in maximum force (p=0.011), average force (p=0.011), peak frequency (p=0.027) and total  (p=0.003). Higher force sensitivity (Subcategory of GEARS Score) and Total GEARS Score correlated with lower nerve forces applied with total  (J) -0.66(0.019) and -0.87(0.000), respectively, which was significantly different between novices and experts (p=0.003). VUA leak rate highly correlated with total RACE score -0.86 (0.000), which was significantly different between novices and experts (p=0.003).We present a realistic, feedback-driven, full-immersion simulation platform for development and evaluation of surgical skills pertinent to nerve-sparing prostatectomy. Correlation of validated GEARS and RACE objective metrics with CRPMS suggests a novel method for real-time assessment and feedback during robotic surgery training. Further work is required to assess the ability to predict live surgical outcomes.© 2019 The Authors BJU International © 2019 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679452></a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674610>Controlling surface cation segregation in a nanostructured double perovskite GdBaCoO electrode for solid oxide fuel cells.</a></h1><p>Mechanistic studies, utilizing molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, were undertaken to provide a molecular level explanation of Ba cation segregation in double perovskite GdBaCo2O5+δ (GBCO) electrodes. The  (γ) of the terminal surface having only Ba cations, indicated the surface to be the most stable (γ = 6.7 kJ mol-1 Å-) as compared to the other surfaces. MD simulations elaborated on the cation disorder in the near surface region where Ba cations in the subsurface region were observed to migrate towards the surface. This led to a disruption in cation ordering with a propensity to form multiphases in the near surface region. In the near surface zone, oxygen anion diffusivity was observed to be reduced by an order of magnitude (D = 1.6 × 10-11 cm2 s-1 at 873 K) as compared to the bulk oxygen anion diffusivity value (D = 1.96 × 10-10 cm2 s-1 at 873 K). A novel idea was then proposed to control the degree of surface segregation of Ba cations by applying nanostructuring of the GBCO material in the form of nanoparticles. MD simulations elucidated that the near surface region having a high degree of cation disorder in the nanostructured GBCO may regain back the oxygen anion diffusivity value (D = 3.98 × 10-10 cm2 s-1, at 873 K) comparable to the bulk core region (D = .51 × 10-10 cm2 s-1, at 873 K). A proof of concept experiment was setup to test this hypothesis. The electrochemical performance of the electrode, fabricated using GBCO nanoparticles, was measured to improve by 15% as compared to the electrode synthesized with a bulk size GBCO material. This was attributed to the control in Ba-cation segregation, obtained on nanostructuring which resulted in higher oxygen anion transport in the near-surface region of the electrode material. XPS characterization of the surface of the nanostructured GBCO materials supported this assertion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676952>Ultra-processed food consumption drives excessive free sugar intake among all age groups in Australia.</a></h1><p>To analyze the contribution of ultra-processed foods to the intake of free sugars among different age groups in Australia.Dietary intakes of 12,153 participants from the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (2011-12) aged + years were evaluated. Food items collected through two 24-h recalls were classified according to the NOVA system. The contribution of each NOVA food group and their subgroups to total  intake was determined by age group. Mean free sugar content in diet fractions made up exclusively of ultra-processed foods, or of processed foods, or of a combination of un/minimally processed foods and culinary ingredients (which includes table sugar and honey) were compared. Across quintiles of the  contribution of ultra-processed foods, differences in the intake of free sugars, as well as in the prevalence of excessive free sugar intake (≥ 10% of total ) were examined.Ultra-processed foods had the highest  contribution among children, adolescents and adults in Australia, with older children and adolescents the highest consumers (53.1% and 54.3% of total , respectively). The diet fraction restricted to ultra-processed items contained significantly more free sugars than the two other diet fractions. Among all age groups, a positive and statistically significant linear association was found between quintiles of ultra-processed food consumption and both the average intake of free sugars and the prevalence of excessive free sugar intake.Ultra-processed food consumption drives excessive free sugar intake among all age groups in Australia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675452>Bone Marrow and Muscle Fat Infiltration are Correlated Among Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis: the AMBERS Cohort Study.</a></h1><p>Bone and muscle have shown to interact, but little is known about fat within bone and muscle. Clinical studies have isolated fat within bone and muscle using MRI. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related, and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women 60-85 years of age were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed DXA of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg. Fat segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error<5%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow fat) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4±5.9yrs, BMI: 29.5±5.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle fat was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, weight, average daily  expenditure, hypertension and diabetes. Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis. Fat from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and diabetes. More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone fat metabolism and mesenchymal cell commitment to fat within patients with osteoporosis.

The device is comprised of a staggered linear array of NiTi in wire form that, as a shape memory alloy, can achieve linear displacement through material phase change when heated. This change allows the crystal lattice within the material to displace/adjust. The design results in strain levels of 20.4% that are comparable to those of biological muscles and provides potential for additional strain. Three- to seven-staggered NiTi wires are tested to demonstrate the different levels of strain that are achieved with a range of wires in a staggered array. In addition, we measure and compare force generated to the mass of each wire to show system force-to-mass ratio. The effective force to mass for the system is greater than 5500 combined with a seven-wire staggered array. The device shows that a lightweight, high-strain actuator can be developed, and our research demonstrates its potential use in prosthetic actuation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670502>A Genetically Encoded Fluorescent Amino Acid for Monitoring Protein Interactions through FRET.</a></h1><p>Förster resonance  transfer (FRET) is a well-established method for studying macromolecular interactions and con-formational changes within proteins. Such a method normally uses fluorescent proteins or chemical labeling methods which are often only accessible to surface exposed residues and risk disturbing target protein structures. Here, we demonstrate that the genetic incorporation of a synthetic fluorescent amino acid, L-(7-hydroxycoumarin-4-yl) ethylglycine (Cou), and natural endogenous fluorophore Tryptophan (Trp) residues of a protein, could serve as an efficient FRET pair to monitor protein interactions, using the signaling transducer β-arrestin-1 as a model system. We used this technology to record the dynamic spectra in both binding and competition experiments of β-arrestin-1, the contribution of each specific phosphate in ternary complex formation, in a rapid and efficient manner. The determined Kd value for the association between the active arres-tin and Fab30 is 0.68 μM in the three components interaction system. Moreover, we were able to determine the contributions of the site 3 phospho-site and the site 6 phospho-site binding each contributed to the high affinity ternary complex assem-bling as .7 folds and 15.5 folds respectively, which were never determined before. These results thus highlighted the poten-tial usage of this new method in measurement of the allosteric induced enhanced affinity with small amount proteins and in a fast manner and in a complex system. Collectively, our newly developed Trp : Cou FRET system based on genetic expan-sion technology has extended the molecular toolboxes available for biochemical and structural biology studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670728>The layered uranyl silicate mineral uranophane-β: crystal structure, mechanical properties, Raman spectrum and comparison with the α-polymorph.</a></h1><p>The crystal structure, elastic properties and the Raman spectrum of the layered calcium uranyl silicate pentahydrate mineral uranophane-β, Ca(UO2)2Si2O6(OH)·5H2O, are studied by means of first-principles solid-state methods and compared with the corresponding information for the α polymorph. The availability of the  optimized full crystal structure of uranophane-β, including the positions of the hydrogen atoms, made possible the computation of its elastic properties and the Raman spectrum by using the theoretical methodology. An extended set of relevant mechanical data is reported. Uranophane-β is shown to be a weak and ductile mineral and, consequenty, is mechanically very different from the α polymorph which is a hard and brittle material. Uranophane-β exhibits the important negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and negative linear compressibility (NLC) phenomena. The experimental Raman spectrum of uranophane-β obtained from a natural mineral sample from pegmatite Perus, São Paulo, Brazil, is compared with the spectrum determined theoretically. Since both spectra are in very good agreement, the theoretical methods are employed to assign the Raman spectrum. Three weak bands of the experimental spectrum of this mineral, located at the wavenumbers 2302, 2128 and 2042 cm-1, are identified as combination bands. The Raman spectrum of uranophane-β is also compared with that of the α polymorph. While they are rather similar, a detailed analysis reveals a significant number of differences. Finally, the relative thermodynamic stability of the α and β polymorphs is evaluated. The α polymorph is more stable than the β polymorph at zero pressure and temperature by -12.0 kJ mol-1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678374>Enhancing the Solubility of Natural Compound Xanthotoxin by Modulating Stability via Cocrystallization Engineering.</a></h1><p>A comprehensive cocrystal study for the insoluble natural pharmaceutical compound xanthotoxin (XT) was conducted, in which xanthotoxin-para aminobenzoic acid (XT-PABA) and xanthotoxin-oxalic acid (XT-OA) cocrystals were obtained. The xanthotoxin cocrystals were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, and FT-IR spectra, and the crystal structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Crystal structures and thermal analysis showed that XT-OA was more stable than XT-PABA.  framework calculation indicated that H-bond and π···π interactions generated in XT-OA were stronger than that in XT-PABA and xanthotoxin. The powder dissolution experiments of xanthotoxin and its cocrystals suggested the XT-OA cocrystal might be applied as an alternative formulation of API, on account of its enhanced solubility and stability in the hydrochloric acid buffer solution (pH 1.). The cocrystallization engineering can prolong the enhanced apparent solubility via modulating the stability.Copyright © 2019.

The present study is the second part of an extensive research conducted by our group.Output correction factors  were experimentally determined on two linacs, Elekta Versa HD and Varian TrueBeam for 6 and 10 MV beams with and without flattening filter for nine square fields ranging from 0.5 × 0.5 cm to 10 × 10 cm , for seven mini and micro ionization chambers, IBA CC04, IBA Razor, PTW 31016 3D PinPoint, PTW 31021 3D Semiflex, PTW 31022 3D PinPoint, PTW 31023 PinPoint and SI Exradin A16. An Exradin W1 plastic scintillator and EBT3 radiochromic films were used as the reference detectors.For all ionization chambers values of output correction factors  were lower for parallel orientation compared to those obtained in the perpendicular orientation. Five ionization chambers from our study set, IBA Razor, PTW 31016 3D PinPoint, PTW 31022 3D PinPoint, PTW 31023 PinPoint, and SI Exradin A16, fulfill the requirement recommended in the TRS-483 Code of Practice, i.e.,  , down to the field size 0.8 × 0.8 cm , when they are positioned in parallel orientation; two of the ionization chambers, IBA Razor and PTW 31023 PinPoint, satisfy this condition down to the field size of 0.5 × 0.5 cm .The present paper provides experimental results of detector-specific output correction factors for seven small volume ionization chambers. Output correction factors were determined in 6 and 10 MV photon beams with and without flattening filter down to the square field size of 0.5 × 0.5 cm for two orientations of ionization chambers - perpendicular and parallel. Our main finding is that output correction factors are smaller if they are determined in a parallel orientation compared to those obtained in a perpendicular orientation for all ionization chambers regardless of the photon beam , filtration or linear accelerator being used. Based on our findings, we recommend using ionization chambers in parallel orientation, to minimize corrections in the experimental determination of field output factors. Latter holds even for field sizes below 1.0 × 1.0 cm , whenever necessary corrections remain within 5%, which was the case for several ionization chambers from our set. TRS-483 recommended perpendicular orientation of ionization chambers for the determination of field output factors. The present study presents results for both, perpendicular as well as parallel orientation of ionization chambers. When validated by other researchers, the present results for parallel orientation can be considered as a complementary data set to those given in TRS-483.© 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675309>Wavelet Analysis of the Temporal Dynamics of the Laser Speckle Contrast in Human Skin.</a></h1><p>Spectral analysis of laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) signals has been widely used in studies of physiological vascular function regulation. An alternative to LDF is the laser speckle contrast imaging method (LSCI), which is based on the same physical principle. In contrast to LDF, LSCI provides non-scanning full-field imaging of a relatively wide skin area and offers high spatial and temporal resolutions, which allows visualization of microvascular structure. This circumstance, together with a large number of works which had shown the effectiveness of temporal LSCI analysis, gave impetus to experimental studies of the relation between LDF and LSCI used to monitor the temporal dynamics of blood flow.Continuous wavelet transform was applied to construct a time-frequency representation of a signal.Analysis of 10 minute LDF and LSCI output signals recorded simultaneously revealed rather high correlation between oscillating components. It was demonstrated for the first time that the spectral  of oscillations in the 0.01- Hz frequency range of temporal LSCI recordings carries the same information as the conventional LDF recordings and hence it reflects the same physiological vascular tone regulation mechanisms.The approach proposed can be used to investigate speckle pattern dynamics by LSCI in both normal and pathological conditions.The results of research on the influence of spatial binning and averaging on the spectral characteristics of perfusion monitored by LSCI are of considerable interest for the development of LSCI systems optimized to evaluate temporal dynamics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677244>Interfacially polymerized polyamide interlayer onto ozonated carbon nanotube networks for improved stability of sulfur cathodes.</a></h1><p>Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as a promising  storage device owing to high specific capacity and low cost of S cathode, but they are limited by capacity decay and poor cyclability arising from polysulfide shuttling. Herein, we report a facile and scalable method of directly coating a thin (~70 nm) and porous polyamide (PA) interlayer formed by interfacial polymerization onto the S cathode. This polyamide interlayer prevents polysulfide from being shuttled through the physical barrier effect of the PA as well as chemical interactions between the amide functionalities of PA and polysulfides, allowing Li ions to have access to the S electrode. Thus, the resulting PA-coated cathode exhibits ~64.% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 1C with only 0.035% decay per cycle with a moderate capacity of 1008 mAh g ─1 .© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Oil, gas, and water are vital resources that are usually transported by extensive pipe networks. Therefore, wireless self-powered sensors are a sustainable choice to monitor in-pipe system applications. The mechanism, which is intended for water pipes with diameters of -5 inches, contains a piezoelectric beam assembled to the oscillating body. A novel U-shaped geometry of an underwater  harvester has been designed and implemented. Then, the results have been compared with the traditional circular cylinder shape. At first, a numerical study has been carried at Reynolds numbers Re = 3000, 6000, 9000, and 12,000 in order to capture as much as kinetic  from the water flow. Consequently, unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS)-based simulations are carried out to investigate the dynamic forces under different conditions. In addition, an Adaptive Differential Evolution (JADE) multivariable optimization algorithm has been implemented for the optimal design of the harvester and the maximization of the power extracted from it. The results show that the U-shaped geometry can extract more power from the kinetic  of the fluid than the traditional circular cylinder harvester under the same conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677481>Simultaneous determination of 24 free amino acids in MGC803 cells by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Amino acids play key roles in cellular protein biosynthesis and  metabolism pathways. In this study, a simple, rapid and sensitive method was developed for the simultaneous determination of 24 free amino acids in cell samples using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS). Cell samples were deproteinized with methanol/HO (80:20, v/v) without intricate derivatization process. The analytes were separated on a Waters BEH Amide column (.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm), and accomplished within 5 min at a flow rate of 0. mL/min. The good linearity was obtained for all analytes (r > 0.99) with the limits of quantification from 0.1 to 25 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precision ranged from 0.35 to 10.36% and from .22 to 9.93%, respectively. The recoveries of most analytes were between 80% and 120% with RSD less than 10.0%.

Precise information about bauxite mineralogical composition is challenging and crucial for efficient aluminum extraction and for the determination of its appropriateness for different industrial applications. For the qualitative and quantitative analysis of bauxite ore, we performed laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) in conjunction with x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), scanning electron microscopy coupled with  dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Analysis of the acquired optical emission spectrum revealed the presence of Si, Al, Fe, K, Ti, Ca, Mg, Na, Cr, and Sr. The plasma temperature and electron number density values estimated using Boltzmann plot and Stark-broadening line profile methods were 5600 K and 7.65×10  cm, respectively. In the present study we show that a calibration-free LIBS method presents a powerful solution, enabling quantitative analysis of multi-element bauxite ore better than traditional analytical techniques. The bauxite quantification obtained using CF-LIBS under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium and optically thin plasma was Si=47.31%, Al=31.90%, Fe=16.54%, K=.45%, Ti=1.64%, and Ca=0.16%, and its comparison with the outcome from XRD, XRF, SEM-EDS, and FTIR not only assisted but potentially enhanced the mineralogical composition understanding of bauxite ore in the present study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675537>Low dietary magnesium intake alters vitamin D-parathyroid hormone relationship in adults who are overweight or obese.</a></h1><p>Vitamin D metabolism is dependent on magnesium (Mg) as a cofactor; therefore, poor Mg status may alter the relationship between vitamin D metabolite serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s25OHD) and serum parathyroid hormone (sPTH). We hypothesized that low dietary Mg intake may alter sPTH response to s25OHD in a population with excess body weight, thereby leading to a worsening of cardiometabolic health. To explore this hypothesis, we conducted a cross-sectional study on adults who were either overweight or obese (owt/ob). Dietary Mg intake was measured using a Mg food frequency questionnaire (MgFFQ). Body composition information was measured using Dual  X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Blood samples were obtained for all biochemical analyses. A total of 57 participants, 22 to 65 years of age, with a body mass index between 25 to 45 kg/m were divided into 3 groups, according to dietary Mg intake percentiles (Low Mg Group = <33 percentile, Medium Mg Group = 33 to 66 percentile, High Mg Group = >66 percentile). Higher s25OHD was negatively associated with lower sPTH in the High Mg Intake group (r = -0.472, P = .041), but not in other groups. A positive relationship between s25OHD and serum high-molecular weight adiponectin concentrations was observed in the High Mg Group (r = 0.532, r = 0.022), but not in other groups. Serum Interleukin-6 concentrations were negatively associated with s25OHD (r = -0.316, P = .017) for the entire study group.

However, no studies have addressed the influence of differences in the volume of drink intake on gastric motility and  intake. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of differences in the volume of drink intake before a meal on subsequent gastric motility and  intake in healthy young men. Twelve men completed two, one-day trials in a random order. Subjects visited the laboratory after a 10-h overnight fast and consumed the nutrient drink (0.84 MJ) in either 100 mL or 600 mL quantities over a 5-min period. Then, the subjects sat on a chair for over  h to measure their cross-sectional gastric antral areas and gastric contractions with an ultrasound imaging system. Thereafter, the subjects consumed a test meal until they felt completely full.  intake was calculated from the amount of food consumed.  intake in the 600 mL trial was 12% higher than the 100 mL trial (5.1 ± 1.3 vs. 4.6 ± 1.4 MJ, P = 0.046). The antral area (P = 0.046) and the frequency of the gastric contraction (P = 0.001)  h after consuming the nutrient drink were higher in the 600 mL trial than the 100 mL trial. These findings demonstrated that consumption of a 600 mL nutrient drink increased  intake. The modulation of gastric motility might have some effects on  intake.Copyright © 2019.

Herein, an innovative solution was proposed using a three-stage Simultaneous Ammonium oxidation Denitrifying (SAD) process. Firstly, ammonia (1760 ± 126 mg N/L) in wastewater was oxidized to nitrite in a partial nitrification sequencing batch reactor (PN-SBR). Next, 93% PN-SBR effluent and concentrated external waste activated sludge (WAS; MLSS = 23057 ± 6014 mg/L) were introduced to an anoxic reactor for integrated fermentation and denitrification (IFD-SBR). Finally, ammonia (101.4 ± 13.8 mg N/L) released by fermentation in the IFD-SBR and residual 7% nitrite in the PN-SBR were removed through the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process in the SAD up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (SAD-UASB). In addition, NO-N generation during the anammox process could be reduced to nitrite by partial denitrification (PD) and reused as substrate for anammox. A satisfactory total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency (98.3%), external sludge reduction rate (.5 kg/m d) and effluent TN concentration (16.7 mg/L) were achieved after long-term operation (280 days). The IFD-SBR and SAD-UASB contributed to 81.9% and 12.3% nitrogen removal, respectively. Microbial analysis showed that anammox bacteria (1.5% Candidatus Brocadia) cooperated well with partial denitrifying bacteria (4.3% Thauera) in SAD-UASB, and average nitrogen removal contribution were 83.1% during significant stability of anammox and 9.% during the denitrification process, respectively. The three-stage SAD process provides an environmental and economic approach for landfill leachate treatment since it has the advantage of 25.4% less oxygen, 100% organic matter savings and 47.9% less external sludge than traditional biological processes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The ARC was harvested and analyzed for IKKβ, NF-κB, PICs, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NAD(P)H (gp91phox,p47phox) oxidase activitylevels and neuropeptides.Compared with normal rats, T2D rats were characterized by hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, cardiac dysfunction, as well as higher ARC levels of IKKβ, NF-κB, PICs, ROS, gp91phox and p47phox. ARC infusion of IKKβ inhibitor SC-514 attenuated all these changes in T2D rats, but not in normal rats.Our results indicate that hypothalamic IKKβ/NF-κB pathway plays a key role in modulatingenergy imbalance and cardiac dysfunction, suggesting its potential therapeutic role during type 2diabetes.© 2019 S.

The hydroxyl groups on these water soluble derivatives of inositol are substituted with diphosphate and monophosphate moieties. Since the discovery of PP-IPs in the early 1990s, enormous progress has been made in uncovering pleiotropic roles for these small molecules in cellular physiology. PP-IPs exert their effect on proteins in two ways - allosteric regulation by direct binding, or post-translational regulation by serine pyrophosphorylation, a modification unique to PP-IPs. Serine pyrophosphorylation is achieved by Mg-dependent, but enzyme independent transfer of a β-phosphate from a PP-IP to a pre-phosphorylated serine residue located in an acidic motif, within an intrinsically disordered protein sequence. This distinctive post-translational modification has been shown to regulate diverse cellular processes, including rRNA synthesis, glycolysis, and vesicle transport. However, our understanding of the molecular details of this phosphotransfer from pyrophospho-inositol to generate pyrophospho-serine, is still nascent. This review discusses our current knowledge of protein pyrophosphorylation, and recent advances in understanding the mechanism of this important yet overlooked post-translational modification.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

By taking into account that storage is a key factor in the effective use of renewable , the present article is an overview about storage systems which are appropriate for BIPV and BIPVT applications. The literature review shows that there are multiple storage solutions, based on different kinds of materials (batteries, Phase Change Material (PCM) components, etc.). In terms of BIPV and BIPVT with batteries or PCMs or water tanks as storage systems, most of the installations are non-concentrating, façade- or roof-integrated, water- or air-based (in the case of BIPVT) and include silicon-based PV cells, lead-acid or lithium-ion batteries, paraffin- or salt-based PCMs. Regarding parameters that affect the environmental profile of storage systems, in the case of batteries critical factors such as material manufacturing, accidental release of electrolytes, inhalation toxicity, flammable elements, degradation and end-of-life management play a pivotal role. Regarding PCMs, there are some materials that are corrosive and present fire-safety issues as well as high toxicity in terms of human health and ecosystems. Concerning water storage tanks, based on certain studies about tanks with volumes of 300 L and 600 L, their impacts range from 5.9 to 11.7 GJ and from 0.3 to 1.0 t CO. Finally, it should be noted that additional storage options such as Trombe walls, pebble beds and nanotechnologies are critically discussed. The contribution of the present article to the existing literature is associated with the fact that it presents a critical review about storage devices in the case of BIPV and BIPVT applications, by placing emphasis on the environmental profile of certain storage materials.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The optimal protein quantity and pattern to support muscle mass maintenance in cancer patients is unknown. The aim of the current exploratory study was to observe the pattern and quantity of dietary protein intake as well as the prevalence of muscle wasting in patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing primary anti-neoplastic treatment. The secondary aim was to assess the potential contributory factors associated with maintenance of muscle mass.A longitudinal observational study was conducted in patients with NSCLC undergoing first line of anti-neoplastic treatment. Nutrient intake was assessed by repeated 24-h recalls and skeletal muscle by routine thoraco-abdominal CT scans at baseline and after three cycles of treatment. Descriptive analyses, paired samples t-test, binomial logistic and linear regression analyses were performed.Out of 186 consecutively screened patients, 62 were included and 52 patients were available for analysis. Protein intake increased from baseline to follow up, but were lower in muscle wasters (1.0 g/kg/d) than in muscle maintainers (1.4 g/kg/d). The majority of the meals contributed less than 20 g of protein and less than 10% of the meals contributed at least 40 g of protein. Significant loss of skeletal muscle area was observed in 26 out of 52 patients. A higher protein intake (OR 18.7, p = 0.01),  intake (OR 1.1, p = 0.04) and stable body weight (OR 1., p = 0.03) were associated with muscle maintenance in the univariate regression, whereas age, sex, cachexia, tumour stage, treatment adherence and response did not. In the multivariate regression, a trend was seen for protein intake (OR 35., p = 0.08) and body weight (OR 1., p = 0.06).Muscle wasting occurred frequently and early during primary anti-neoplastic treatment. Protein intake seems important for maintaining skeletal muscle. Validated dietary methods in cancer patients must be identified and the optimal protein quantity and intake pattern to support muscle maintenance should be explored in future trials.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

In the present studies, we investigated the antiangiogenic effects of dietary -DG on tumour (Lewis lung carcinoma [LLC]) as well as ionising radiation-induced angiogenesis in mouse models. Dietary -DG reduced the serum vascular endothelial growth factor levels (∼40%) in LLC-bearing mice along with a significant inhibition of tumour growth and metastases. In vivo Matrigel plug assays showed significant decrease in vascularisation, Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran fluorescence and factor VIII-positive cells in the plugs from -DG-fed mice, supporting the notion that dietary -DG significantly suppresses the tumour-associated and radiation-induced angiogenesis. -DG inhibited the glucose usage and lactate production as well as ATP levels of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a concentration-dependent manner, accompanied by growth inhibition and loss of viability in vitro. Furthermore, -DG inhibited the capillary-like tube formation in Matrigel as well as migration and transwell invasion by HUVECs, which are functional indicators of the process of angiogenesis. These results suggest that dietary -DG inhibits processes related to angiogenesis, which can impair the growth and metastasis of tumours.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Multi-foci axial intensity distribution generated by a phase pattern displayed on a spatial light modulator irradiates silica, causing ablation and its internal modification. The following wet etching step defines the diameter r, while the radius of curvature R (hence, the focal length f) is maintained the same. As a result, the numerical aperture NA=r/f changes from 0. to 0.4 for the same pulse  (but different number of multi-foci) during ablation. An isotropic wet etching of silica becomes highly anisotropic for the initial stages of etching following the irradiated pattern. Subsequent evolution of the shape is governed by an isotropic silica etch and forms a spherical lens.

Trapping for adults was conducted in Italy with novel live (or lethal) traps consisting of aggregation pheromone-baited cylinders with a wind vane, with the upwind end covered by mesh and the downwind end sealed by a removable entry-only mesh cone, admitting the attracted bugs. The novel traps caught up to 15-times more adult  than identically-baited sticky panels in two weeks of daily checking (n = 6 replicates) (the new live traps were, in Run 1, 5-, 9-, 15-, 13-, 4-, 12-, -fold; and in Run , 7-, 1-, 3-, 7-, 6-, 6-, and 5-fold better than sticky traps, daily). The maximum catch of the new traps was 96 live adults in one trap in 24 h and the average improvement was ~7-fold compared with sticky panels. The rotating live traps, which exploit a mesh funnel facing the plume downwind that proved useful for collecting adults, could also be used to kill bugs. We expect that commercially-available traps could replace the crude prototypes we constructed quickly from local materials, at low cost, as long as the principles of a suitable plume structure were observed, as we discuss. The traps could be useful for the sterile insect technique, supporting rearing colonies, or to kill bugs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669490>Integrated thermodynamic analysis of electron bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase to inform anaerobic metabolism and H production.</a></h1><p>Electron bifurcating, [FeFe]-hydrogenases are recently described members of the hydrogenase family and catalyze a combination of exergonic and endergonic electron exchanges between three carriers ( ferredoxin + NAD(P)H + 3H =  ferredoxin + NAD(P) +  H). A thermodynamic analysis of the bifurcating, [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction, using electron path-independent variables, quantified potential biological roles of the reaction without requiring enzyme details. The bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction, like all bifurcating reactions, can be written as a sum of two non-bifurcating reactions. Therefore, the thermodynamic properties of the bifurcating reaction can never exceed the properties of the individual, non-bifurcating, reactions. The bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction has three competitive properties: 1) enabling NAD(P)H-driven proton reduction at pH higher than the concurrent operation of the two, non-bifurcating reactions, ) oxidation of NAD(P)H and ferredoxin simultaneously in a 1:1 ratio, both are produced during typical glucose fermentations, and 3) enhanced  conservation (~10 kJ mol H) relative to concurrent operation of the two, non-bifurcating reactions. Our analysis demonstrated ferredoxin E°' largely determines the sensitivity of the bifurcating reaction to pH, modulation of the reduced/oxidized electron carrier ratios contributed less to equilibria shifts. Hydrogenase thermodynamics data were integrated with typical and non-typical glycolysis pathways to evaluate achieving the 'Thauer limit' (4 H per glucose) as a function of temperature and pH. For instance, the bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction permits the Thauer limit at 60 °C if pH  ≤ ~10 mbar. The results also predict Archaea, expressing a non-typical glycolysis pathway, would not benefit from a bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction; interestingly, no Archaea have been observed experimentally with a [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzyme.Copyright © 2019.

The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. CuS nanoplates anchored on the surface of hierarchical BiWO microspheres consisting of BiWO nanosheets to form a CuS/BiWO p-n junction photocatalyst. The photocatalytic activity of glyphosate degradation over CuS/BiWO under 44 W light-emitting diode (LED) light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) was investigated. The results indicate that the CuS/BiWO heterojunctions display higher photocatalytic activity than pure CuS and BiWO. The improved photocatalytic activity of the CuS/BiWO heterostructures can be attributed to strong visible light absorption and enhanced separation of photogenerated charge carriers by the internal electric field near the interface of the p-n junction. In addition, the CuS/BiWO p-n junction photocatalysts consisting of nanosheets are beneficial for the transport of photoexcited charge carriers, thus resulting in the increase of the photocatalytic activity of glyphosate degradation.

Self-reported SB was obtained from the GPAQ. Objectively measured SB was assessed using the Intelligent Device for  Expenditure and Activity. Participants wore the Intelligent Device for  Expenditure and Activity continuously during  consecutive days while following their daily routine. The relative validity was assessed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (ρ), and the agreement was examined using mean bias and 95% limit of agreement with the Intelligent Device for  Expenditure and Activity as reference.The results showed small correlations (ρ = .291, P < .001) between the SB from the GPAQ and the objective measures, and ranged from ρ = .217 to ρ = .491 depending on the potential moderator. Similarly, the GPAQ underestimates the SB for approximately  hours per day in older adults (limit of agreement = -7.3 to 3.4 h/d).The GPAQ may not be the most suitable questionnaire for measuring SB in this population and should be used with caution because those studies that use this questionnaire in older adults may have an inaccurate measurement of SB levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679332></a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673031>Estimation of material parameters based on precipitate shape: efficient identification of low-error region with Gaussian process modeling.</a></h1><p>In this study, an efficient method for estimating material parameters based on the experimental data of precipitate shape is proposed. First, a computational model that predicts the energetically favorable shape of precipitate when a d-dimensional material parameter (x) is given is developed. Second, the discrepancy (y) between the precipitate shape obtained through the experiment and that predicted using the computational model is calculated. Third, the Gaussian process (GP) is used to model the relation between x and y. Finally, for identifying the "low-error region (LER)" in the material parameter space where y is less than a threshold, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy, wherein the estimated GP model suggests the subsequent candidate x to be sampled/calculated. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to the estimation of interface  and lattice mismatch between MgZn ([Formula: see text]) and α-Mg phases in an Mg-based alloy. The result shows that the number of computational calculations of the precipitate shape required for the LER estimation is significantly decreased by using the proposed method.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669900>Comparison of the yields of mono-, Di- and tri-chlorinated HAAs and THMs in chlorination and chloramination based on experimental and quantum-chemical data.</a></h1><p>Thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the formation of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids determined based on the quantum chemical (QC) simulations were compared in this study with the experimental data generated using the differential spectroscopy approach in chlorination and chloramination. The ratios of the slopes of the correlations between -DlnA values and individual DBPs concentrations (S/S) were observed to be linearly correlated with the ratios of the Gibbs free energies (ΔG/ΔG) of the corresponding reactions of chloramine and chlorine with acetaldehyde which was used as a model DBP precursor in QC simulations. Further QC examination of the kinetics of chlorination and chloramination of the model compound acetoacetic acid showed that the activation  of reactions between monochloramine that directly participates in substitution reactions to form mono-, di and tri-halogenated intermediates are -3 times higher than those of HOCl formed via the hydrolysis monochloramine. This result confirms that the interactions of chloramine with NOM and ensuing DBP formation are primarily mediated by the free chlorine released as a result of the hydrolysis of monochloramine while direct halogenation of NOM by monochloramine is likely to provide a small contribution to DBP formation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The performance of the RAOC in 1,4-dioxane removal was compared to that of a TiO slurry reactor by evaluating the removal efficiencies in pure water (PW) and the BTLL. In the TiO slurry reactor, 1,4-dioxane was hardly degraded in the BTLL during 66 h of treatment because of strong inhibition by coexisting substances in the BTLL. In contrast, the RAOC successfully removed 1,4-dioxane from the BTLL by 89% through adsorption and by 81% through photocatalysis during treatment for 66 h. The ratio of the rate constants for degrading 1,4-dioxane in the BTLL and PW by the RAOC was two orders of magnitude higher than that for a TiO slurry reactor. This shows that the RAOC greatly mitigated the inhibition by coexisting substances in the BTLL. The electrical  required for 1,4-dioxane degradation in the BTLL by the RAOC was much lower than that required for degradation by the TiO slurry reactor. The results show that the RAOC equipped with AC/TiO composite sheets effectively removed 1,4-dioxane from BTLL.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The growing need for their structural assignment, as well as the need for the development of the detection and screening methods, provides the motivation to understand their fundamental properties and reactivity. Here, we investigated the decomposition of protonated ronidazole [Roni+H] in low- and high- collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the main fragmentation channels involve intramolecular proton transfer from nitroimidazole to its side chain followed by a release of NHCOH, which can proceed via two pathways involving transfer of H from (1) the N3 position via a barrier of TS2 of 0.97 eV, followed by the rupture of the C-O bond with a thermodynamic threshold of .40 eV; and () the -CH group via a higher barrier of .77 eV, but with a slightly lower thermodynamic threshold of .24 eV. Electrospray ionization of ronidazole using deuterated solvents showed that in low- CID, only pathway (1) proceeds, and in high- CID, both channels proceed with contributions of 81% and 19%.

Low carnitine availability may contribute to metabolic inflexibility and impaired glucose tolerance. Here, we investigated whether carnitine supplementation improves metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity in impaired glucose tolerant (IGT) volunteers.Eleven IGT- volunteers followed a 36-day placebo- and L-carnitine treatment ( g/day) in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind crossover design. A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (40 mU/m/min), combined with indirect calorimetry (ventilated hood) was performed to determine insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility. Furthermore, metabolic flexibility was assessed in response to a high- meal. Skeletal muscle acetylcarnitine concentrations were measured in vivo using long echo time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS, TE=500 ms) in the resting state (7:00AM and 5:00PM) and after a 30-min cycling exercise. Twelve normal glucose tolerant (NGT) volunteers were included without any intervention as control group.Metabolic flexibility of IGT-subjects completely restored towards NGT control values upon carnitine supplementation, measured during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and meal test. In muscle, carnitine supplementation enhanced the increase in resting acetylcarnitine concentrations over the day (delta 7:00 AM versus 5:00 PM) in IGT-subjects. Furthermore, carnitine supplementation increased post-exercise acetylcarnitine concentrations and reduced long-chain acylcarnitine species in IGT-subjects, suggesting the stimulation of a more complete fat oxidation in muscle. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was not affected.Carnitine supplementation improves acetylcarnitine formation and rescues metabolic flexibility in IGT-subjects.

In fact, some of the newly prepared molecules revealed comparable or even better inhibitory activities compared to the marketed drugs (rivastigmine or galanthamine) and commercially applied pesticide Diuron, respectively. Generally, most compounds exhibited better inhibition potency towards AChE; however, a wider activity span was observed for BChE.

Finding the optimum sonication time can help to save  and ensure optimal design. The present study deals with the sonication time effect on the evaporation rate of seawater containing a nanocomposite (i.e., a mixture of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoplates). For indoor experiments, a solar simulator was employed as the radiation source. At first, the nanofluid with a concentration of 0.01% wt. was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for different times of 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 min, and the associated zeta potential values were recorded to evaluate the stability. Next, the best time function was used to appraise the effect of concentration variations (0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04% wt.) and the light intensities (1.6, .6, and 3.6 suns) on the rate of solar steam generation. The results indicate that for a concentration of 0.01% wt. and under 3.6 suns, the highest evaporation efficiency of 61.3% would be achieved at 120 min sonication time.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The adiabatic ionization  of the CP was accurately determined to be 9.2697 ± 0.0009 eV, based on the VUV photoionization efficiency curve obtained using high-resolution VUV-photoionization time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectroscopy. The constructed potential  contours, associated with the twisting and out-of-plane motions in the S and D states, revealed that the ionization  value corresponded to a twisted conformer with C symmetry at the global minimum. Subsequently, the low photon  above the ionization onset of the twisted conformer in the CP led to CH elimination, producing a CHO fragment directly prior to CO elimination for the CH  fragment. The appearance energies for the CHO and CH  were determined to be 9.7068 ± 0.0017 eV and 9.7483 ± 0.0017 eV, respectively, by measuring the fragmentation yield curves for two fragments analyzed in the TOF mass spectra. The formation enthalpy for each fragment ion at 0 K, evaluated using the measured and thermochemical data, enabled the realization of plausible structures for the produced fragment ions. Consequently, based on the results of the quantum chemical calculation on the dissociation processes of the twisted CP cation (t-CP), we suggest that the fragmentation processes to CHO and CH  correspond to the methylketene and (E)--butene cations, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675896>Molecular structure and non-covalent interaction of -thiophenecarboxaldehyde and its monohydrated complex.</a></h1><p>The rotational spectrum of -thiophenecarboxaldehyde was investigated by using supersonic jet Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The measurements were extended to the S, S, C, and O isotopologs for the cis conformer, as well as to the S and C isotopologs for the trans conformer, leading to an accurately structural determination of the two observed conformers. The unchanged experimental P values upon isotopic substitution indicate effective planar geometries of the two conformers. The ring structures of thiophene are slightly different between the cis and trans conformers. Two isomers of the monohydrated complex of -thiophenecarboxaldehyde, formed between a cis or trans monomer with water stabilized by an O-H⋯O hydrogen bond (HB) and an additional (C=O)CH⋯O(HO) or (C)CH⋯O(HO) HB, respectively, were observed in jet expansion. The noncovalent interactions attributed to the stabilization of the monomer and the monohydrated complex are revealed by quantum chemical methods. The interaction  for trans-w-1 is 4 kJ mol larger than that of cis-w-1, attributed to the relative stronger CH⋯O HB.

The NCDs with good water solubility and 17% of quantum yield was synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method, using ammonium citrate and dextrin as carbon source and nitrogen source, respectively. The fluorescence of NCDs was obviously quenched by Hg and can be recovered, due to stronger interaction between thiourea and Hg. There was a good linear relationship between the recovered fluorescence and the concentration of thiourea within range of 0.90-10.0 μM and the detection limit for thiourea detection was 0.15 μM. The as-prepared NCDs can be used for determination of thiourea in tap water, lake water and rice flour products, and the spike recoveries were between 91.6 and 108%.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The search for an alternative treatment of infections caused by E. faecalis, without using antibiotics, is off great clinical importance. The aim of present investigation was to assess the efficacy of using 3.32 ηg/mL of 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) as photosensitizer associated with the use of either Laser (λ660 nm) or LED (λ632 ±  nm) using different  densities (6, 12 and 18 J/cm) to kill E. faecalis in vitro. Under different experimental conditions, 14 study groups, in triplicate, were used to compare the efficacy of the aPDT carried out with either the laser or LED lights using different  densities associated to DMMB. The most probable number method (MPN) was used for quantitative analysis. Photodynamic antimicrobial effectiveness was directly proportional to the  density used, reaching at 18 J/cm, 99.999998% reduction of the counts of E. faecalis using both light sources.

However, the combination and manipulation of variables (intensity and volume) allow for different training adaptations.This review aimed to investigate the effect of ST on EE in adults using a systematic literature review and subsequent meta-analysis.The search was performed on the electronic databases using the following keywords: strength training (resistance training; strength training; strength training method) and  expenditure ( metabolism;  expenditure; caloric expenditure, caloric cost) with "AND" and "OR" combination. Manual searches of references were also conducted for additional relevant studies. After evaluating the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the selected studies were analyzed according to strength training methods and the training variables used to measure EE.We identified two ST methods from the literature review: circuit training (CT) and traditional training (TT). Meta-analysis showed a significant effect on EE increase, which favor TT when compared with CT (-0.99 [95%CI: -1.96, -0.02], p < 0.01) with I of 89% (p < 0.01). After adjusting for bias risk, no significant differences were found in EE associated with intensity (-0.40, 95% CI [0.98, 0.18], p = 0.18).The present review and meta-analysis indicated that the intensity of exercise does not seem to be associated with an increase of EE in ST.© 2019 Scandinavian Society of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine.

Understanding of the intrinsic nature of sulfur ChBs is critical to reveal their functions. In this work, we report the first rotational spectroscopic investigation on the novel SF ChB in a 1 : 1 molecular complex of ,,4,4-tetrafluoro-1,3-dithietane (C2F4S2) and difluoromethane (DFM). The rotational spectra measured with Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy on the six isotopologues of the complex allow the determination of the SF distance to be .9759(6) Å and the associated angle to be 157.90(3)°. Experimental results and quantum chemical calculations clearly support the formation of SF ChB in the complex. The uncovered structure also shows the existence of two C-HF and two C-FF-C contacts.

In this study we applied time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize the kinetics of  transfer processes in three types of PSI-LHCI supercomplexes isolated from the low (LL), medium (ML) and extreme high light (EHL) conditions. We show that the average rate of fluorescence decay is not correlated with the size of LHCI antenna and is twice faster in complexes isolated from ML-grown cells (~25-30 ps) than from both LL- and EHL-exposed cells (~50-55 ps). The difference is mainly due to a contribution of a long ~100-ps decay component detected only for the latter two PSI samples. We propose that the lack of this phase in ML complexes is caused by perfect coupling of this antenna to PSI core and lack of low- chlorophylls in LHCI. On the other hand, the presence of the slow, ~100-ps, fluorescence decay component in LL and EHL complexes may be due to the weak coupling between PSI core and LHCI antenna complex, and due to the presence of particularly low- or red chlorophylls in LHCI. Our study has revealed the remarkable functional flexibility of light harvesting strategies that have evolved in the extremophilic red algae in response to harsh or limiting light conditions involving accumulation of low  chlorophylls that exert two distinct functions: as  traps or as far-red absorbing light harvesting antenna, respectively.Copyright © 2019.

This research presents the first use of a patient-reported outcome measure designed to assess patient-perceived benefits and disadvantages of drugs received during clinical studies.The Patient's Qualitative Assessment of Treatment (PQAT) was developed in English and cognitively tested with US (n = 4) and Canadian (n = 3) patients with type 1 and type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The revised version of the PQAT comprises three qualitative open-ended questions focused on the benefits and disadvantages of treatment and reasons why patients would choose to continue/discontinue treatment. A final quantitative question asks patients to evaluate the balance between benefits and disadvantages using a 7-point scale. The revised version of the questionnaire was administered as an exploratory endpoint in a phase II clinical trial for a new injectable treatment for T2DM. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis, and relationships between qualitative and quantitative data were identified.Patient-reported benefits of treatment administered during the clinical trial included clinical markers of efficacy and subjective markers. Disadvantages reported by patients were mainly related to drug adverse effects or to the mode of administration. Of the 57 patients completing the PQAT, 70.% reported being willing to continue treatment, with 59.6% reporting that the benefits outweighed the disadvantages. The reported benefits of feeling better and improved  levels were more likely to be associated with a more positive ratio (70% and 71.4%, respectively), while the disadvantages of fatigue, headaches, and stomach pain were associated with a negative ratio and patients not being willing to continue the treatment.The PQAT is a unique patient-reported outcome tool designed to aid understanding patients' real experience of benefits and disadvantages of a treatment. It combines the richness of qualitative data with quantitative data-information valuable for various stakeholders to make well-informed treatment decisions.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674619>Vertically aligned laser sliced MWCNTs.</a></h1><p>Applications of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) benefit from the availability of specific lengths of the material while keeping the outer walls pristine, for example, for applications requiring vertically aligned tubes. To this end, a simple and effective continuous flow 'top down' process to control the length of sliced MWCNTs has been developed using a vortex fluidic device (VFD) coupled with a 1064 nm pulse laser, with the process in the absence of chemicals and any auxiliary substances. Three different length distributions of the sliced MWCNTs, centered at 75 ± .1 nm, 300 ± 1.8 nm and 550 ± 1.4 nm, have been generated with the length depending on the VFD operating parameters and laser , with the processing resulting in a decrease in side wall defects of the material.

Developing novel catalysts with simple manufacturing requirements, excellent activity levels, and stability remains a long-term goal in terms of practical application. So herein, a new polyethylene terephthalate (PET) non-woven fabric based composite catalyst has been fabricated, using radiation-induced graft polymerization of a functionalized group to chelate Co ions as heterogeneous catalysts in peroxymonosulfate (Oxone) activation. Several impact factors, including catalyst dosage, Oxone concentration, reaction temperature, pH value, Co precipitation ratio (of Co@PET at different pH values), and highly concentrated NaCl have been investigated here. Notably, Co@PET has shown the lowest activation  of any reported catalyst, for degrading RhB by activating Oxone. Interestingly, as experimental RhB and Oxone solutions were passed through single Co@PET sheets, the RhB was decomposed into a colorless solution in the penetration process. Based on radical trapping and quenching experiments, a channel was determined to dominate RhB degradation, and furthermore, Co@PET could be re-used for RhB degradation by activating Oxone. These results showed that Co@PET effectively provided improved Fenton-like catalytic performance and stability, and was suitable for practical applications.Copyright © 2019.

However, the key application components of the mass transfer operations and diffusion coefficient have not been determined. In this study, a modified Finite Bath Diffusion Control Model was mathematically developed containing a constant related to the radius of the adsorbent particle and the fractional attainment of adsorption. The adsorption experiments were conducted under various initial Pb(II) concentrations ranging from 60 mg L to 100 mg L. The results suggested that the modified Finite Bath Diffusion Control Model was more applicable to the experimental data than the original Finite Bath Diffusion Control Model. The average value of the diffusion coefficient (λD¯) obtained from the modified finite bath diffusion control model was 1.63 × 10 cm s indicating the effective diffusivity in the adsorption of Pb(II) on MOMC-NP. Overall, the modified Finite Bath Diffusion Control Model exhibited the precise description and simulation of the mass transfer kinetics for Pb(II) adsorption onto MOMC-NP.

The composites were systematically studied with respect to their mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. The thermal conductivity was found to increase greatly (>100%) even at low fractions of the AlN fillers. The electrical breakdown strength of the composites was not considerably affected by the AlN filler, while the dielectric constants and dielectric loss were found to be increased with AlN filler ratios. At higher doping levels above 5 wt% (~.5 vol%), electrical tracking performance was improved. The AlN filler increased the tensile strength as well as the hardness of the composites, and decreased their flexibility. The hydrophobic properties of the composites were also studied through the measurements of temperature-dependent contact angle. It was shown that at a doping level of 1 wt%, a maximum contact angle was observed around 108°. Theoretical models were used to explain and understand the measurement results.

Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in  and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = 5) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety.

Duration of pre- and postpartum feeding of RPC averaged (±standard deviation) 22.0 ± 6.0 and 57.5 ± 42. d, respectively. Data collected included the ingredient composition and chemical analyses of pre- and postpartum diets, amount of choline ion supplemented, number of cows per treatment, frequency of health events, and the least squares means and respective standard error of the means for production responses, liver composition, and blood parameters. The concentrations of net  for lactation and metabolizable amino acids and protein (MP) in pre- and postpartum diets were predicted for each treatment mean using National Research Council (2001). Mixed model meta-analysis was conducted including the random effect of experiment and weighting by the inverse of the standard error of the means squared. Increasing supplementation of choline ion during transition linearly increased pre- (β = 0.0184 ± 0.00425) and postpartum dry matter intake (β = 0.0378 ± 0.00974), and yields of milk (β = 0.436 ± 0.112), -corrected milk (ECM; β = 0.422 ± 0.0992), fat (β = 0.00555 ± 0.000793), and protein (β = 0.0138 ± 0.00378). Nevertheless, an interaction between choline and postpartum metabolizable methionine as a percent of MP (METMPPo) was observed for yields of milk, ECM, and protein because as METMPPo increased, the positive response to choline on yields of milk, ECM, and protein decreased. Supplementing choline during transition tended to reduce the risks of retained placenta and mastitis, but it had no effect on metritis, milk fever, displaced abomasum and ketosis, or the concentration of triacylglycerol in the hepatic tissue postpartum. The median amount of choline ion supplemented was 12.9 g/d and responses in postpartum dry matter intake and yields of milk, ECM, fat, and protein to that amount of supplementation were 0.5, 1.6, 1.7, 0.07, and 0.05 kg/d, respectively. No interactions were observed between supplemental choline and prepartum dietary net  for lactation or metabolizable methionine as a percent of MP. Collectively, feeding RPC during the transition period improves performance in parous cows. Increases in yields of milk and milk components were observed in spite of pre- and postpartum diets, although the increments in milk, ECM, and protein yields with supplementing choline decreased as the concentration of methionine in postpartum diets increased. The optimum dose of choline ion was not detected, but likely it is more than the 12.9 g/d fed in most experiments evaluated in the current meta-analysis. Finally, the meta-analysis identified lack of sufficient data to understand the role of supplemental choline in nulliparous cows.The Authors.

In a first step, both previous parameters were estimated under 1.52 bar and various acoustic frequencies ranging from 20 to 1000 kHz in function of normalized time. The results showed that the average number density of bubbles, varying within the interval .810-1.4 × 10 bubbles dm, follows a clear monotonous evolving trend as the frequency increases, while the average void fraction, comprised between 9.05 × 10 and 1.95 × 10, demonstrates no dependency of acoustic conditions. In a second step, an  analysis was performed at microscopic and macroscopic scales, which led the authors to figure out that the evolution of the number density of bubbles in function of acoustic frequency is mainly governed by the  required to maintain oscillating the single cavitation bubble.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677513>Improving aerobic sludge granulation in sequential batch reactor by natural drying: Effluent sludge recovery and feeding back into reactor.</a></h1><p>One of the main problems in treating high volumes of wastewater is the long startup time required aerobic granular sludge (AGS), and this issue significantly limits the broad application of advanced AGS technology. To promote rapid AGS formation in the startup phase, a method was developed involving the recovery and natural drying of effluent sludge prior to feeding it back into the sequencing batch reactor (SBR). An analysis of the process shows that supplemented naturally dried sludge swiftly promoted sludge aggregation and granular sludge formation in the reactor, and feeding the SBR with naturally dried sludge aggregates (1.75 ± 0.05 g/L seven times) significantly shortened the granulation time in the startup phase by 14 days. In addition, MLSS, SVI, SVI/SVI, and the average granule size of AGS in the reactor were maintained at 4.66 g/L, 47.4 mL/g, 0.93, and .8 mm, respectively. When fed back into the bioreactor, the aggregates acted as nuclei/carriers in the rapid granulation and played a significant role in rendering the SBR operation stable. This approach could be used to eliminate the random granules aggregation-disintegration mechanism that occurs in the initial stage of AGS formation. The study results reveal that the removal rate of COD and NH-N were above 95% and 96%, respectively. Furthermore, this approach requires less  and significantly reduces the amount of sludge produced (as the effluent sludge is reused).Copyright © 2019.

Patients of Met S were recruited from the Endocrinology and Diabetic Clinic of Sheikh Zayed Hospital Lahore, over the time span of 6 months from July to December 2016. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of ADRB3 was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism and of LXR-α by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction. The frequency of TT variant of ADRB3 T>C in Met S was 69 (34.5%) and in controls 89 (44.5%), frequency of TC 103 (51.5%) and 96 (48%), and of CC 28 (14%) and 15 (7.5%), respectively. In the recessive model (CC: TT + TC), CC genotype was found to be associated with the increased risk of Met S (P = 0.027; odds ratio [OR] = .09; confidence interval [CI] =1.08-4.03) and the association remained significant after controlling for the confounders such as age and sex. The frequency of GG variant of LXR-α G>A in Met S was 35 (17.5%) and in controls 15 (7.5%), GA 129 (64.5%) and 137 (68.5%), and AA 36 (18%) and 48 (24%), respectively. In the recessive model (GG: GA + AA), GG genotype was found to be associated with the increased risk of Met S (P = 0.004; OR = .52; CI = 1.33-4.80) and the association remained significant after controlling for the confounders such as age and sex. It was concluded that SNP of ADRB3 (190 T>C) and LXR-α (-115 G>A) were associated with the risk of Met S and might increase the susceptibility to the obesity-related traits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670730>Tuning two-dimensional phase formation through epitaxial strain and growth conditions: silica and silicate on NiPd(111) alloy substrates.</a></h1><p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials can have multiple phases close in  but with distinct properties, with the phases that form during growth dependent on experimental conditions and the growth substrate. Here, the competition between 2D van der Waals (VDW) silica and 2D Ni silicate phases on NixPd1-x(111) alloy substrates was systematically investigated experimentally as a function of Si surface coverage, annealing time and temperature, O2 partial pressure, and substrate composition and the results were compared with thermodynamic predictions based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and thermochemical data for O2. Experimentally, 2D Ni silicate was exclusively observed at higher O2 pressures (∼10-6 Torr), higher annealing temperatures (1000 K), and more prolonged annealing (10 min) if the substrate contained any Ni and for initial Si coverages up to  monolayers. In contrast, decreasing the O2 pressure to ∼10-8 Torr and restricting the annealing temperature and time enabled 2D VDW silica formation. Amorphous 2D VDW silica was observed even when the substrate composition was tuned to lattice match crystalline 2D VDW silica. The trend of decreased O2 pressure favoring 2D VDW silica was consistent with the theoretical predictions; however, theory also suggested that sufficient Si coverage could avoid Ni silicate formation. The effect of epitaxial strain on 2D Ni silicate was investigated by modifying the solid solution alloy substrate composition. It was found that 2D Ni silicate will stretch to match the substrate lattice constant up to 1.12% tensile strain. When the lattice mismatch was over 1.40%, incommensurate crystalline domains were observed, indicating relaxation of the overlayer to its favored lattice constant. The limited epitaxial strain that could be applied was attributed to a combination of the 2D silicate stiffness, the insensitivity of its bonding to the substrate to its alignment with the substrate, and its lack of accessible structural rearrangements that can reduce the strain . The results demonstrate how the resulting 2D material can be manipulated through the growth conditions and how a solid solution alloy substrate can be used to maximize the epitaxial strain imparted to the 2D system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671412>Quantum entanglement and transport in a non-equilibrium interacting double-dot system: The curious role of degeneracy.</a></h1><p>We study quantum entanglement and its relation to transport in a non-equilibrium interacting double dot system connected to electronic baths. The dynamical properties in the non-interacting regime are studied using an exact numerical approach whereas the steady state properties are obtained following the well-known non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach. By means of mutual information and concurrence we explore the connection between the quantum correlations in the system and the current flowing through the dots. It is observed that entanglement between the dots is heavily influenced by the degeneracy or the lack thereof, of the dot levels. In the non-degenerate case, the concurrence falls sharply when the applied bias crosses a certain critical value. In contrast when the dot  levels are degenerate, the concurrence reaches a very high asymptotic value of $1/$. When interactions are switched on, the degeneracy is lifted, and once again concurrence falls to zero beyond a critical value of the applied bias. Lastly it is observed that the concurrence can be made to reach almost the value of $1.0$ if the chemical potential in both baths are made very large (while keeping the sign the same) provided the dot levels are kept degenerate within the non-interacting limit. A combination of NEGF method, brute-force numerics and asymptotics are employed to corroborate our findings.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671360>Inter-correlated gut microbiota and SCFAs changes upon antibiotics exposure links with rapid body-mass gain in weaned piglet model.</a></h1><p>The risk of overweight or obesity in association with early exposure of antibiotics remains an important public issue for health-care of children. Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal microbiota were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and  utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, -methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic microbiota to increase utilization of carbohydrates and , enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The pump source is a homemade actively Q-switched Yb-doped silica fiber laser at 1.1 μm, yielding a repetition rate of 80 kHz and a pulse width of 300 ns. A plane-ruled grating in a Littrow configuration functions as the tuning element. At the launched pump power of .78 W, stable gain-switched pulses tunable within a ~300 nm range of 2800~3095 nm are achieved.

The ERK-1/ inhibitors are thus considered as potential agents for cancer therapy. Multitarget quantitative structure-activity relationship (mt-QSAR) models based on the Box-Jenkins approach were developed with a dataset containing 6400 ERK inhibitors assayed under different experimental conditions. The first mt-QSAR linear model was built with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and provided information regarding the structural requirements for better activity. This linear model was also utilised for a fragment analysis to estimate the contributions of ring fragments towards ERK inhibition. Then, the random forest (RF) technique was employed to produce highly predictive non-linear mt-QSAR models, which were used for screening the Asinex kinase library and identify the most potential virtual hits. The fragment analysis results justified the selection of the hits retrieved through such virtual screening. The latter were subsequently subjected to molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to understand their possible interactions with ERK enzymes. The present work, which utilises in-silico techniques such as multitarget chemometric modelling, fragment analysis, virtual screening, molecular docking and dynamics, may provide important guidelines to facilitate the discovery of novel ERK inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670269>Nutrition rehabilitation of children with severe acute malnutrition: Revisiting studies undertaken by the National Institute of Nutrition.</a></h1><p>Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children under five years is an important public health problem due to associated high mortality and long-term health consequences. Research on the dietary causes of SAM, especially the role and relative importance of dietary protein, in the aetiology of oedematous malnutrition, has led to considerable debates and controversies. The present article revisits some of the debates in this field, where the researchers at the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, India, with their pioneering work, have contributed to the global literature on the various facets of the disease. Highlighting the importance of  as a bigger problem than protein malnutrition is a noteworthy contribution of NIN's research. It is, however, important to examine the protein quality of the diets in light of the new information on the lysine requirements. The article argues that the currently dominating hypothesis of free radical theory requires a critical review of the supporting evidence. Over the past few decades, the research has focused on low-cost diets using locally available foods. The article also argues that solutions based on local foods, being acceptable and sustainable, need to be strengthened for their effective delivery through the existing nutrition programmes. Recent evidence shows that the use of ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF) with high micronutrient density may be linked with higher mortality possibly due to the high iron content, which could be counterproductive. There are several unaddressed concerns regarding the potential long-term impact of consumption of RUTF in children with SAM. More evidence and a cautious approach are, therefore, needed before implementing these solutions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672442>Active pyruvate dehydrogenase and impaired gluconeogenesis in orthotopic hepatomas of rats.</a></h1><p>Therapies targeting altered activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) have been proposed for hepatomas. However, the activities of these pathways in hepatomas in vivo have not been distinguished. Here we examined pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle through PDH versus PC in vivo using hepatoma-bearing rats.Hepatoma-bearing rats were generated by intrahepatic injection of H4IIE cells. Metabolism of C-labeled glycerol, a physiological substrate for both gluconeogenesis and  production, was measured with C NMR analysis. The concentration of key metabolites and the expression of relevant enzymes were measured in hepatoma, surrounding liver, and normal liver.In orthotopic hepatomas, pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle occurred exclusively through PDH and the excess PDH activity compared to normal liver was attributed to downregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) /4. However, pyruvate carboxylation via PC and gluconeogenesis were minimal, which was linked to downregulated forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by Akt activity. In contrast to many studies of cancer metabolism, lactate production in hepatomas was not increased which corresponded to reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase. The production of serine and glycine in hepatomas was enhanced, but glycine decarboxylase was downregulated.The combination of [U-C]glycerol and NMR analysis enabled investigation of multiple biochemical processes in hepatomas and surrounding liver. We demonstrated active PDH and other related metabolic alterations in orthotopic hepatomas that differed substantially not only from the host organ but also from many earlier studies with cancer cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, Ga emits the most energetic positrons for PET imaging. The lack of information of the positron range effect on spatial resolution for this positron emitter is an issue, particularly in preclinical imaging.The line spread function (LSF) in tissue-equivalent materials with densities between 0. and 1.93 g/cm was obtained with Ga and F. A complementary study with the NEMA NU 4-2008 image quality phantom is also included.High- positrons moving in lower density materials produce far-reaching activity distributions. The LSFs were characterized with Lorentzian-Gaussian fits, with spatial resolution (FWHM) in the .14-3. mm range, and long tails extending a few tens of mm depending on the material type and density. A narrowing of the LSF was observed for lung-equivalent materials, indicating the lack of enough material for the positron annihilation to take place. The NEMA NU 4-2008 image quality phantom produced blurred images, notoriously observed in the hot and cold cylinders used for evaluation of recovery coefficients (RC) and spill-over ratios (SOR), producing very low RC and very large SOR.Quantitative PET imaging with the non-conventional Ga is hampered due to the large range of its high- positrons affecting both spatial resolution and activity concentration quantification.Copyright © 2019 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.

Systematical investigating the regulatory mechanism of chloroplast development and chlorophyll (Chl) content variation is necessary for clarifying the photosynthesis mechanism for crops.This study aims to explore the critical regulatory mechanism of leaf color mutation in a yellow-green leaf sesame mutant Siyl-1.We performed the genetic analysis of the yellow-green leaf color mutation using the F population of the mutant Siyl-1. We compared the morphological structure of the chloroplasts, chlorophyll content of the three genotypes of the mutant F progeny. We performed the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (-DE) and compared the protein expression variation between the mutant progeny and the wild type.Genetic analysis indicated that there were 3 phenotypes of the F population of the mutant Siyl-1, i.e., YY type with light-yellow leaf color (lethal); Yy type with yellow-green leaf color, and yy type with normal green leaf color. The yellow-green mutation was controlled by an incompletely dominant nuclear gene, Siyl-1. Compared with the wild genotype, the chloroplast number and the morphological structure in YY and Yy mutant lines varied evidently. The chlorophyll content also significantly decreased (P < 0.05). The -DE comparison showed that there were 98 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) among YY, Yy, and yy lines. All the 98 DEPs were classified into 5 functional groups. Of which 82.7% DEPs proteins belonged to the photosynthesis and  metabolism group.The results revealed the genetic character of yellow-green leaf color mutant Siyl-1. 98 DEPs were found in YY and Yy mutant compared with the wild genotype. The regulation pathway related with the yellow leaf trait mutation in sesame was analyzed for the first time.

Herein, a Co(ii) ion-driven self-assembly strategy is described for the synthesis of cobalt-based nanostructured transition metal compounds (Co-NTMCs) embedded in nitrogen and sulfur codoped hierarchical porous carbon submicrospheres (Co-NTMCs@NSC), where condensation of thiourea-ethylenediamine-formaldehyde resin (TEFR) is induced by Co(ii) ions which is simultaneously assembled with polydopamine to form a multifunctional precursor through coordinated interaction. The resulting Co-NTMCs@NSC sample comprises abundant hierarchical porous textures, a high content of active cobalt species including the nanoparticles of Co, Co3O4 and amorphous CoSx, and a considerable amount of defective structures. These characteristics lead to remarkable oxygen electrocatalytic activities, with a half-wave potential of +0.833 V vs. RHE, which is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and a lower overpotential of 284 mV than RuO2 at 10 mA·cm- for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Furthermore, its operational stability is also much higher than that of commercial RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts. When used as a breathing air electrode for Zn-air batteries, Co-NTMCs@NSC shows a higher open-circuit voltage (1.509 V), higher discharge power density (262 mW cm-) and better charge-discharge reversibility than commercial Pt/C.

However, its utilization has some drawbacks like the transformation of the active species into the undesired dichloramine. Although it is more pronounced in acidic solutions, the features of this reaction have still remained largely unexplored in the pH < 4 region. In this study the decomposition of monochloramine is examined under such conditions by using kinetic and computational methods. Fast kinetics measurements have convincingly showed that the disproportion into dicloramine is relatively fast and can be studied without any interference from side reactions. By varying the pH, the deprotonation constant of monochloramine has been determined by UV spectroscopy (Ka = 0.023 ± 0.005 M for I = 1.0 M NaClO4, and T = 25.0 °C). Dichloramine formation via monochloramine disproportion was found to follow second-order kinetics. The computations have provided the reaction mechanism and its free  profile in accord with the proposed kinetic model. This involves the reaction between the protonated and unprotonated forms of monochloramine, with a rate constant k = 335.3 ± 11.8 M-1 s-1, corresponding to an activation free  barrier of 14.1 kcal mol-1. The simulations predicted a barrier of 14.9 kcal mol-1 and revealed a key short-lived chlorine-bridged intermediate which yields dichloroamine and ammonium ion through a deprotonation-coupled chlorine shift.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675663>A zinc-quinone battery for paired hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis.</a></h1><p>Hydrogen peroxide is a commodity chemical with immense applications as an environmentally benign disinfectant for water remediation, a green oxidant for synthetic chemistry and pulp bleaching, an  carrier molecule and a rocket propellant. It is typically synthesized by indirect batch anthraquinone process, where sequential hydrogenation and oxidation of anthraquinone molecules generates HO. This highly  demanding catalytic sequence necessitates the advent of new reaction pathways with lower  expenditure. Here we demonstrate a Zn-quinone battery for paired HO electrosynthesis at the three phase boundary of its cathodic half-cell during electric power generation. The catalytic quinone half-cell of the Zn-quinone battery, mediates proton coupled electron transfer with molecular oxygen during its chemical regeneration thereby pairing peroxide electrosynthesis with electricity generation. Hydrogen peroxide synthesizing Zn-quinone battery (HPSB) demonstrated a peak power density of ~90 mW/cm at a peak current density of ~145 mA/cm while synthesizing ~230 mM of HO. HPSB offers immense opportunities as it distinctly couples electric power generation with peroxide electrosynthesis which in-turn transforms  conversion in batteries truly multifunctional.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to design and validate a simple, quick and universal weekly rescreening tool to identify hospital acquired nutritional deterioration during a child's hospital stay.A prospective, longitudinal sample of children aged 0-16 years admitted to a paediatric tertiary hospital with a length of stay ≥7 days were included in the study. Agreement between nutritional deterioration markers of reduction in weight (kg), body mass index (kg/m),  intake (kcal/day) and protein intake (g/day) over a 7-day period and two proposed rescreening questions was determined using sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve and positive and negative predictive values.Sixty-one children were included in the study with 224 full 7-day datasets. The sensitivity and specificity of the rescreening question 'Has the child had reduced nutritional intake in the last 7 days' for identifying children with a ≥25% reduction in  intake over the previous 7-day period were 61.9% (95% CI 41.1-82.7) and 82.% (95% CI 76.9-87.5) respectively. The sensitivity of 'Has the child lost weight or had poor weight gain' at detecting weight loss was 71.4% (95% CI 54.7-88.) and specificity 87.8% (95% CI 83.1-92.5).The paediatric nutrition rescreening questions provide a valid and simple tool to detect nutritional deterioration in long stay paediatric patients and should be an integral part of the nutrition care process.Crown Copyright © 2019.

The adsorbent (MIL-100(Fe)-4 h) containing unsaturated metal sites, improved the conversion of CO to dissolved inorganic carbon by 52.3% and concentration of HCO by 20.0% in culture medium, as compared to the medium without CO adsorbent added. The increased HCO concentration facilitated carboxysome accumulation (increased to 21.7 times) to activate the photosynthetic Calvin cycle in Arthrospira cells. The increased cell growth rate promoted cell volume by 132% and knot length by 102%, while the fractal dimension of the cell surface decreased by 13.5%. The biomass productivity of Arthrospira cells cultivated with the CO adsorbent MIL-100(Fe)-4 h remarkably increased by 81.9%.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that the passing beam achieves the target light distribution with multiple light patterns superimposed by reflectors, and can meet the four segment light types under the regulations: Class C, Class V, Class E, and Class W. With the structural design method of the reflector, a cutoff line is formed under the structure without a visor to reduce the  waste caused by the shielding structure, so that the maximum luminosity of the passing beam under the road section can reach 75,980.7 cd and the simulated maximum photometric value can reach 69,705.9 cd under Class W. The driving beam uses the total internal reflection (TIR) lens design to find the optimal 36° angle of the lens to effectively achieve the straightening and brightness enhancement of the light, and then uses the response surface methodology to optimize the optical divergence of the parameters of the microlenticular lens structure on the TIR lens to adjust the width and flatness of the light type. Among them, the radius of curvature, the thickness of the lens, and the length of the single lens are selected as the factors. Using the experimental design method of the reaction surface, the optimal solution of the driving beam design is found. The optimal solution is combined into a radius of curvature of 14.99 mm in the X direction and 25.22 mm in the Y direction, the overall thickness is 1.5 mm, and the length of a single curved surface is .43. Each factor is within the limit, and the maximum brightness in the center is 213,866 cd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670345>Two mononuclear dysprosium(iii) complexes with their slow magnetic relaxation behaviors tuned by coordination geometry.</a></h1><p>Two mononuclear dysprosium(iii) complexes [Dy(H3NAP)2Cl2]Cl·EtOH (1) and [Dy(H3NAP)(H2O)Cl2]Cl·-2CH3CN·MeOH·0.5H2O () were obtained by coordinating an in situ formed Schiff base ligand of 1,3-bis(-hydroxynaphthalenemethyleneamino)-propan--ol (H3NAP) to the dysprosium(iii) ion. Their Dy(iii) centers are six and seven-coordinated in octahedral and pentagonal-bipyramidal coordination geometries, respectively. Their structural difference is caused by the additional coordinated water molecule in the equatorial positions of complex  in comparison with that of complex 1. The well designed semi-rigid ligand contributes significantly to the low coordination numbers of Dy(iii) ions in the two title complexes, as well as to their structural difference. Magnetic investigations revealed that complexes 1 and  are both field-induced single-ion magnets (SIMs) with their effective  barriers being 22.9(6) and 153.9(5) K, respectively.

It is a unique example of an immune deficiency that is linked to dysfunctional mitochondrial  metabolism and caused by adenylate kinase  (AK2) deficiency. It is characterized by an early differentiation arrest in the myeloid lineage, impaired lymphoid maturation, and sensorineural hearing loss. In this study, a novel AK2 homozygous mutation, c.622 T > C [p.Ser208Pro], was identified in an Old Order Amish patient through whole exome sequencing. Functional studies showed that the patient's cells have no detectable AK2 protein, as well as low oxygen consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and proton production rate (PPR). An increased production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane permeability, and mitochondrial mass, and decreased ATP production, were also observed. The results confirm the pathogenicity of the AK2 mutation and demonstrate that reticular dysgenesis should be considered in Amish individuals presenting with immune deficiency. We also describe other pathophysiological aspects of AK2 deficiency not previously reported.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678889>Paperboard mill wastewater treatment via combined dark and LED-mediated fermentation in the absence of external chemical addition.</a></h1><p>Paperboard mill wastewater (PMWW) was treated using two subsequent dark and photo up-flow intermitted stirring tank reactors (UISTRs) under different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) without external chemical use. HRT of 12 h revealed the maximum overall H productivity of 1394.1(±70.6) mL/L/d with contents of 48.9(±.5) and 47.4(±1.4)% for dark- and photo-processes, respectively. Overall substrate removal efficiency (SDE) of 58.9(±4.5)% was registered at HRT o 12 h. High H productivity was ascribed to fermentation type occurred at dark reactor, since acetate and butyrate accounted for 70.9% of volatile fatty acids. Besides, pH and carbon to nitrogen ratio of dark reactor's effluent at HRT = 12 h were 5.5(±0.1) and 30.0(±.5), respectively which are the optimum levels for photo fermentation process. Moreover, energetic and economic analyses emphasized on the superiority of 12 h-HRT, where net gain , daily saving and payback period accounted for 1319.5 kWh/d, 148.7 $/d and 9.8 years, respectively.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Vertebral fracture risk prediction using dual  x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is confounded by limitations of the technology, such as 2D measurements of bone mineral density (BMD), inability to measure bone distribution and heterogeneity, and potential overestimations of BMD due to degenerative diseases. To overcome these shortcomings, single  (SE) quantitative computed tomography (QCT) imaging estimates of Hounsfield units (HU) and volumetric BMD have been implemented as alternative methodologies for assessing fracture risk. However, marrow fat within the vertebrae can highly affect the vBMD and fracture properties estimations. To address this issue, 54 vertebrae were dissected from nine cadaveric spines and scanned using SE-QCT (120kVp) and dual  (DE)-QCT (80/140 kVp), with the latter accounting for marrow fat within the vertebrae. The vertebrae were then scanned using DXA and subjected to mechanical testing to obtain fracture properties. aBMD outcomes from DXA showed a better correlation with DE-QCT vBMD versus SE outcomes [DE: aBMD vs. vBMD (R: 0.61); SE: aBMD vs. vBMD (R: 0.27)]. SE-QCT underestimated vertebral vBMD by -56%; p <  0.0001 when compared to DE-QCT. vBMD estimates from SE-QCT could predict 45% and 37% of the vertebral failure loads and stiffness, respectively, compared to 67% and 46% from DE-QCT. DE-QCT vBMD outcomes highly correlated with fracture properties of vertebrae as compared to SE-QCT metrics. As DE scanning has the ability to correct for the effects of bone marrow fat, estimated vBMD from SE-QCT were significantly underestimated compared to DE-QCT. Dual  CT scanning has the potential to more accurately predict vertebral failure and aid the clinician in the evaluation of appropriate interventions. Future studies should consider implementing DE-QCT in their fracture assessment.Copyright © 2019.

This study proposed a sustainable stabilization/solidification (S/S) of As-contaminated sediment via novel valorization of red mud waste, blast furnace slag and calcined clay mineral, which were selected to mitigate the increased leaching of As under alkaline environment of S/S treatment. Quantitative X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analyses illustrated that stable Ca-As complexes (e.g., Ca(AsO)OH) could be formed at the expense of Ca(OH) consumption, which inevitably hindered the hydration process and S/S efficiency. The Si nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that incorporation of metakaolin for As immobilization resulted in a low degree of hydration and polymerization, whereas addition of red mud promoted Fe-As complexation and demonstrated excellent compatibility with As. Transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping further confirmed the precipitation of crystalline Ca-As and amorphous Fe-As compounds. Therefore, red mud-incorporated S/S binder achieved the highest efficiency of As immobilization (99.9%), which proved to be applicable for both in-situ and ex-situ S/S of As-contaminated sediment. These results advance our mechanistic understanding for the design of green and sustainable remediation approach for effective As immobilization.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

A challenge for triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) processes is to realize these features in solid materials without undesired phase segregation and detrimental dye aggregation. To achieve this, we combine a palladium porphyrin sensitizer and a 9,10-diphenylanthracene annihilator within a crystalline mesoporous metal-organic framework using an inverted design. In this modular TTA system, the framework walls constitute the fixed sensitizer, while caprylic acid coats the channels providing a solvent-like environment for the mobile annihilator in the channel. The resulting solid material shows green-to-blue delayed upconverted emission with a luminescence lifetime of 373±5 µs, a threshold value of 329 mW cm- and a triplet-triplet  transfer efficiency of 82%.

Low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) are classified as slow-adapting (SA) or rapid-adapting (RA) based on whether or not they spike repetitively during sustained tactile stimulation; the former are subclassified as type 1 or  based on the regularity of their spiking. Recording  from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of mice, we observed irregular- and regular-spiking units consistent with SA1 and SA2 LTMRs, but some units, which we labeled "semi-regular", did not fit cleanly into the existing classification scheme. Analysis of their spiking revealed integer-multiple patterning - spike trains comprised a fundamental interspike interval and multiples thereof. Integer-multiple-patterned spiking was reproduced by randomly removing spikes from an otherwise regular spike train, suggesting that semi-regular units represent SA2 units in which some spikes are "missing". We hypothesized that missing spikes arose from intermittent failure of spikes to initiate or to propagate. Intermittent failure of spike initiation was ruled out by several observations: integer-multiple-patterned spiking was not induced by intradermal lidocaine, was independent of stimulus modality (mechanical vs. optogenetic), and could not be reproduced in a conductance-based model neuron given constant input. On the other hand, integer-multiple-patterned spiking was induced by application of lidocaine to the DRG, thus pinpointing intermittent failure of spike propagation as the basis for integer-multiple-patterned spiking. In fact, half of all SA2 units exhibited some missing spikes, mostly at low rate (<5%), which suggests that axons are efficient in using the lowest safety factor capable of producing near-perfect propagation reliability.The impedance mismatch at axon branch points can impede spike propagation. Reliability of spike propagation across branch points remains an open question, and is especially important for primary afferents whose spikes must cross a T-junction in order to reach the CNS. Past research on propagation reliability has relied almost entirely on simulations and  experiments. Here, recording , we linked a distinctive pattern of spiking to the intermittent failure of spike propagation at the T-junction. The rarity of failures argues that safety factor is high under physiological conditions, yet the occurrence of such failures argues that safety factor is  high enough to ensure -perfect reliability, consistent with a good balance between propagation reliability and  efficiency.Copyright © 2019 the authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670620>An overview of prospective drugs for type 1 and type  diabetes.</a></h1><p>This study provided an overview of several emerging anti-diabetic molecules.Diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder involving dysregulation of glucose homeostasis at various levels. Insulin, which is produced by β-pancreatic cells, is a chief orchestrator of glucose metabolism, regulating its consumption within cells, which leads to  generation or storage as glycogen. Abnormally lower insulin secretion from β-cells, insulin insensitivity, and insulin tolerance lead to higher plasma glucose levels, resulting in metabolic complications. The last century has witnessed extraordinary efforts by the scientific community to develop anti-diabetic drugs, and these efforts yielded the discovery of exogenous insulin and various classes of oral anti-diabetic drugs.Despite these exhaustive anti-diabetic pharmaceutical and therapeutic efforts, long-term glycemic control, hypoglycemic crisis, safety issues, large-scale economic burden, side effects remain core problems.The last decade has witnessed the development of various new classes of anti-diabetic drugs with different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profiles. Details of their FDA approvals and advantages/disadvantages are summarized in this review, Result: Salient features of insulin degludec, sodium glucose co-transporter  inhibitors, glucokinase activators, fibroblast growth factor 21 receptor agonists, and GLP-1 agonists are discussed.In the future, these new anti-diabetic drugs should have broad clinical applicability.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679612></a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678732>Deep eutectic solvent as an efficient modifier of low-cost adsorbent for the removal of pharmaceuticals and dye.</a></h1><p>Waste from biomass was used to prepare a low-cost biochar-clay hybrid adsorbent. The hybrid adsorbent was synthesised by combining Kaolin with biomass (Vitex doniana), thereafter, modified with Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES). The materials were characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), also, pHpzc of the materials were studied. The resultant adsorbents were used for both column and batch adsorption of organic pollutants; dye (Acid Blue 74; AB74) and pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxacin; CIP and acetaminophen; ACTE). Column adsorption capacity, effect of pollutant concentration and effect of flow rate were studied, also, the column was modelled using Thomas, Yoon-Nelson and Adams-Bohart model. Furthermore, batch adsorption experiments were performed, effect of change in pH, time, dose and concentration were studied. Batch adsorption data were fitted with isotherm and kinetic models. The experiment showed tremendous increase in adsorption capacity when the hybrid adsorbent (HYD) was modified with DES (HYD-DES). Acid Blue 74 on HYD-DES has the highest column sorption capacity followed by ciprofloxacin and acetaminophen. Adsorption was favoured at pH range of -10 for both AB74 and ACTE as there is no significant changes in the % removal performance, while adsorption was best at pH 6 and above for CIP. AB74 and CIP are best described by Langmuir isotherm, whereas ACTE adsorption was best explained by Freundlich isotherm equilibrium. The DES modified HYD has shown it can be effectively utilised as possible adsorbent for adsorbing organic dyes and pharmaceuticals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In northwestern Iberia, D. acuminata has a long growing season, from spring to early autumn, and populations develop as soon as shallow stratification forms when the upwelling season begins. In contrast, D. acuta blooms in late summer, when the depth of the pycnocline is maximal and upwelling pulses are moderate. In situ observations on the hydrodynamic regimes during the two windows of opportunity for Dinophysis species led us to hypothesize that D. acuta should be more sensitive to turbulence than D. acuminata. To test this hypothesis, we studied the response of D. acuminata and D. acuta to three realistic turbulence levels low (LT), ε ≈ 10 m s; medium (MT), ε ≈ 10  m s and high (HT), ε ≈ 10 m sgenerated by Turbogen, a highly reproducible, computer-controlled system. Cells of both species exposed to LT and MT grew at rates similar to the controls. Marked differences were found in the response to HT: D. acuminata grew slowly after an initial lag phase, whereas D. acuta cell numbers declined. Results from this study support the hypothesis that turbulence may play a role in shaping the spatio-temporal distribution of individual species of Dinophysis. We also hypothesize that, in addition to cell disturbance affecting division, sustained high shear generated by microturbulence may cause a decline in Dinophysis numbers due to decreased densities of ciliate prey.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We are investigating a hydrocarbon pathway from mixed sugars via 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfural intermediates. To achieve this goal, we must first convert glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural in favorable yields. Current processes to produce HMF/furfural generally involve the use of acid catalysts in biphasic systems or solvents such as ionic liquids. However, the yield from transforming glucose to HMF is lower than the yield of furfural from xylose.In this study, we present an efficient chemical pathway simultaneously transforming glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural via ketose intermediates, i.e., fructose and xylulose, which were generated from glucose and xylose via enzymatic isomerization. In the enzymatic isomerization, by adding sodium borate to complex with the ketoses, xylose conversion reached equilibrium after  h with a conversion of 91% and glucose conversion reached 84% after 4 h. By enzymatically isomerizing the aldoses to ketoses, the following dehydration reactions to HMF and furfural could be performed at low process temperatures (i.e., 110-120 °C) minimizing the side reactions of the sugars and limiting the degradation of furfurals to humins and carboxylic acids. At 120 °C, pH 0.5, and 15 min reaction time, mixed ketose sugars were converted to HMF and furfural in yields of 77% and 96%, respectively (based on starting aldose concentrations).Taken together, our results demonstrate that this combined biological and chemical process could be an effective pathway to simultaneously convert biomass-derived glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural, for use as intermediates in the production of hydrocarbons.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673289>Protein hydrolysis and fermentation under methanogenic and acidifying conditions.</a></h1><p>Many kinds of wastewaters contain appreciable quantities of protein. Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of  as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH 5.The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately 5 times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino acids. Nineteen different amino acids were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) of these 19 amino acids was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH 5 was -25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH 5) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty acids (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino acid fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670970>Side Chain Optimization Remarkably Enhances the In Vivo Stability of 18F-Labeled Glutamine for Tumor Imaging.</a></h1><p>Similar to glycolysis, glutaminolysis acts as a vital  source in tumor cells, providing building blocks for the metabolic needs of tumor cells. To capture glutaminolysis in tumors, 18F-(2S,4R)4-Fluoroglutamine ([18F]FGln) and 18F-fluoroboronoglutamine ([18F]FBQ) have been successfully developed for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, but these two molecules are lack of stability, resulting in undesired yet significant bone uptake. In this study, we found that [18F]FBQ-C2 is a stable Gln PET tracer by adding two more methylene groups to the side chain of [18F]FBQ. [18F]FBQ-C2 was synthesized with a good radiochemical yield (RCY) of 35% and over 98% radiochemical purity. [18F]FBQ-C2 showed extreme stability in vitro, and no defluorination was observed after  hours in phosphate buffered saline at 37 °C. The competitive inhibition assay results indicated that [18F]FBQ-C2 enters cells via system ASC and N, similar to natural glutamine, and can be transported by tumor-overexpressed ASCT2. PET imaging and biodistribution results indicated that [18F]FBQ-C2 is stable in vivo with low bone uptake (0.81±0.20%ID/g) and can be cleared rapidly from most tissues. Dynamic scan and pharmacokinetic studies using BGC823-xenograft-bearing mice revealed that [18F]FBQ-C2 accumulates specifically in tumors, with a longer half-life (101.18±6.50 min) in tumor tissues than in other tissues (52.70±12.44 min in muscle). Biodistribution exhibits a high tumor-to-normal tissue ratio (4.8±1.7 for muscle, .5±1.0 for the stomach, .±0.9 for the liver and 17.8±8.4 for the brain).

A possible surface reaction mechanism, the insightful information on the structure-activity relationship and the involvement of reactive oxygen species elucidated in this work lay an important background for the material design and encourage a further development of highly efficient photocatalysts toward organic fine chemical syntheses.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, its practical application is still seriously limited by the modest cycling and rate performances. Herein, we first report a facile design to scalably synthesize the unique one-dimensional (1D) mesoporous ZnMnO 3 nanorods (ZMO-NRs) composed of nanoscale particles (~11 nm). The 1D mesoporous structure and nanoscale building blocks of the ZMO-NRs effectively promote the transport of ions/electrons, accommodate severe volume changes, and expose more active sites for lithium storage. Benefiting from these appealing structural merits, the obtained ZMO-NRs anode exhibits excellent rate behavior (~454 mAh g -1 at  A g - 1 ) and ultra-long term cyclic performance (~949.7 mAh g - 1 even over 500 cycles at 0.5 A g - 1 ) for efficient lithium storage. Besides, the LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O  //ZMO-NRs full cell presents a practical  density (~192. Wh kg -1 ) and impressive cyclability with ~91% of capacity retention over 110 cycles. It highlights the ZMO-NRs product is a highly promising high-rate and stable electrode candidate towards advanced LIBs in electronic devices and sustainable  storage applications.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the present study, flower-like molybdenum disulfide decorated with iron oxide nanoparticles (MoS/FeO) is designed via a two-step hydrothermal method and mainly applied in the removal of Hg(II) and Pb(II) ions in aqueous environment. Exhaustive morphological, chemical and magnetic characterizations verify the successful formation of magnetic MoS/FeO. Batch adsorption experiments show that the obtained MoS/FeO nanohybrid enables efficient capture of Hg(II) and Pb(II) ions, accompanied by ease-of-separation from solution by simply applying a magnet. In this respect, high adsorption capacities (263.6 mg g for Pb(II) and 428.9 mg g for Hg(II)) can be gained under optimized conditions (pH = 5.0; 298 K; nanohybrid dosage: 0.8 g L and the contact time: 180 min). In addition, the effects of different parameters such as initial Pb(II)/Hg(II) concentration (50-500 mg L), temperature (298, 308 and 318 K) and co-existing ions (Zn(II), Cu(II), Cd(II) and Mg(II)) were systematically probed. The favorable adsorption capacity, selectivity and recyclability mainly originates from the strong Hg/Pb···S bonding interactions. Practical application potential of magnetic MoS/FeO nanohybrid in realistic lead-acid battery industry wastewater and Pb(II)-contaminated soil is further explored, achieving promising results with high Pb(II) removal efficiency of 99.63% for wastewater and 57.15% for soil. Simple preparation, easy separation and high adsorption capacity would foster thus-designed sulfide-based nanohybrid a promising adsorbent for heavy metal removal from wastewater and contaminated soil.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The electrical resistivity of Pd-Ag vs. the temperature presents the characteristic S-shaped curve with a minimum and a maximum of the resistivity in different positions for the tests in hydrogen and deuterium. The results have been related to: (1) the different isotope ratios, H/M and D/M, and () their position in the Pd-Ag lattice. The behavior of the electrical resistivity is discussed in details by considering the hydrogen and deuterium uploading into the alloy, its effect on the conduction electrons, and the scattering of the isotopes atoms into the metal lattice. Measurements carried out in hydrogen with slow temperature ramping between 25-250 °C evidenced a hysteresis effect that can be explained by the different  levels of isotopes in O-sites and T-sites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669004>Evaluating steady-state resting  expenditure using indirect calorimetry in adults with overweight and obesity.</a></h1><p>Determining a period of steady state (SS) is recommended when estimating resting  expenditure (REE) using a metabolic cart. However, this practice may be unnecessarily burdensome and time-consuming in the research setting.The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of SS criteria, and compare it to alternative approaches in adults with overweight and obesity.In this cross-sectional, ancillary analysis, participants enrolled in a bariatric (study 1; n = 13) and lifestyle (study ; n = 51) weight loss intervention were included. Indirect calorimetry was performed during baseline measurements using a metabolic cart for 25 min, including a 5-min stabilization period at the start. SS was defined as the first 5-min period with a coefficient of variation (CV) ≤10% for both VO and VCO (hereafter REE). Body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis in study  participants only. REE was compared against the lowest CV (REE), 5-min time intervals (REE, REE, REE, REE), 4-min and 3-min SS intervals (REE and REE), and time intervals of 6-15, 6-20 and 6-25 min (REE, REE, and REE) using repeated measures ANOVA and Bland-Altman analysis to test for bias, limits of agreement and accuracy (±6% measured REE).Participants were 54 ± 13 years old, mostly women (75%) and had a BMI of 35 ± 5 kg/m. Overall, 54/63 (84%) of participants reached REE, often (47/54, 87%) within the first 10-min (6-15 min). Alternative approaches to estimating REE had a relatively low bias (-16 to 13 kcals), narrow limits of agreement and high accuracy (83-98%) when compared to REE, in particular, outperforming standard prediction equations (e.g., Mifflin St. Joer).Indirect calorimetry measurements that utilize the 5-min SS approach to estimate REE are considered the gold-standard. Under circumstances of non-SS, it appears 4-min and 3-min SS periods, or fixed time intervals of atleast 5 min are accurate and practical alternatives for estimating REE in adults with overweight and obesity. However, future trials should validate alternative methods in similar populations to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

The species is a competent vector of dengue, chikungunya, Zika viruses and other severe parasites and pathogens threatening human health. The capacity of this mosquito to colonize and establish in new areas (including temperate regions) is enhanced by its ability of producing diapausing eggs that survive relatively cold winters. The main drivers of population dynamics for this mosquito are water and air temperature and photoperiod. In this paper, we present a mechanistic model that predicts the potential distribution, abundance and activity of Asian tiger mosquito in Europe. The model includes a comprehensive description of: i) the individual life-history strategies, including diapause, ii) the influence of weather-driven individual physiological responses on population dynamics and iii) the density-dependent regulation of larval mortality rate. The model is calibrated using field data from several locations along an altitudinal gradient in the Italian Alps, which enabled accurate prediction of cold temperature effects on population abundance, including identification of conditions that prevent overwintering of the species. Model predictions are consistent with the most updated information on species' presence and absence. Predicted population abundance shows a clear south-north decreasing gradient. A similar yet less evident pattern in the activity of the species is also predicted. The model represents a valuable tool for the development of strategies aimed at the management of Ae. albopictus and for the implementation of effective control measures against vector-borne diseases in Europe.Copyright © 2019.

Yet, under less influencing experimental conditions this molecule might undergo an automerization reaction between its two degenerate geometries via a cumulenic (non-alternating, adjacent double bonds) D18h transition state. Herein we discuss the role of quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) in this degenerate reaction. Our computations predict that at the experimental temperature (5 K) the reaction in gas phase is completely driven by an extremely rapid heavy atom tunneling (k = .1 × 108 s-1). Even when approaching room temperature, the QMT rate is still an order of magnitude faster than the semi-classical one. We propose an experimental test to support our prediction, by measuring a characteristic tunneling  splitting within the radio wave region. Additionally, we examine the role of QMT in other hypothetical C4n+ carbon clusters.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The formation, crystal chemistry, and physical properties of UNiB and NbNiB [ternary derivatives of the cubic CrC-type (116, 3̅)] have been studied; the formation of the hypothetical "UNiB" and "NbNiB" has been disproved. UNiB [ = 10.6701() Å] crystallizes in the ordered WCrC-type, whereas NbNiB [ = 10.5842(1) Å] adopts the MgNiB-type. Ni in UNiB can be substituted by U, leading to the solid solution UNiB (0 ≤  ≤ 0.3); oppositely, Nb in NbNiB is partially replaced by Ni, forming the solution NbNiB (0 ≤  ≤ 0.5), none of them reaching the limit corresponding to the hypothetically ordered "UNiB" and "NbNiB". These results prompted us to investigate quaternary compounds UNbNiB and UNbNiB: strong competition in the occupancy of the 4 and 8 sites by U, Nb, and Ni atoms has been observed, with the 4 site occupied by U/Ni atoms only and the 8 site filled by U/Nb atoms only. UNiB, UNiB, and NbNiB are Pauli paramagnets. Interestingly, NbNiB shows ferromagnetism with  ≈ 11 K; the Curie-Weiss fit gives an effective magnetic moment of .78 μ/Ni, suggesting that all Ni atoms in the formula unit contribute to the total magnetic moment. The () data at  K further corroborate the ferromagnetic behavior with a saturation moment of 10 μ/fu (≈0.49 μ/Ni). The magnetic moment of Ni at the 4 site induces a moment in all of the Ni atoms of the whole unit cell (32 and 48 sites), with all atoms ordering ferromagnetically at 11 K. Density functional theory (DFT) shows that the formation of UNiB and NbNiB is energetically preferred. The various electronic states generating ferromagnetism on NbNiB and Pauli paramagnetism on UNiB and NbNiB have been identified.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677831>Associations between maternal characteristics and health, survival, and performance of dairy heifers from birth through first lactation.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to investigate whether health, survival, and performance of dairy heifers from birth through first lactation are associated with parity and health status of their dams. Holstein heifers (n = 1,811) derived from artificial insemination were categorized as (1) daughters of primiparous cows that, consequently, were nonlactating heifers during gestation (Prim-NoL; n = 787); () daughters of multiparous cows that did not have any clinical diseases in the previous lactation (Mult-NoCD; n = 638); and (3) daughters of multiparous cows that had at least one clinical disease in the previous lactation (Mult-CD; n = 386). Clinical diseases of the multiparous dams included retained placenta, metritis, mastitis, lameness, and digestive and respiratory problems. Data collected for evaluation of daughters included genotypic and phenotypic characteristics at birth, morbidity, reproductive performance, and culling from birth through 305 d in milk of first lactation. Orthogonal contrasts were used to evaluate the effect of the parity of the dam (Prim-NoL vs. Mult-NoCD + Mult-CD) and the effect of clinical disease occurrence in the previous lactation among multiparous dams (Mult-NoCD vs. Mult-CD). Compared with daughters of multiparous cows, daughters of Prim-NoL were lighter at birth (36 vs. 41 kg), had greater genetic merit for production traits (e.g., genomic estimated breeding value for milk yield: 875 vs. 746 kg), were less likely to leave the herd (17 vs. 28%) and to lose pregnancy as a heifer (9 vs. 14%), calved earlier (703 vs. 711 d old), were less likely to have clinical diseases as a first lactation cow (30 vs. 37%), and had reduced performance in the first lactation when considering their genetic merit (e.g., 305-d yield of -corrected milk: 11,270 vs. 11,539 kg). Compared with daughters of Mult-NoCD, daughters of Mult-CD were less likely to have digestive problems as a heifer (17 vs. 27%) and clinical disease as a first lactation cow (32 vs. 42%), but were also more likely to leave the herd as a heifer (32 vs. 25%) even though genetic merit for production traits were similar (e.g., genomic estimated breeding value for milk: 744 vs. 749 kg). In conclusion, both parity and health status of the dam in the previous lactation were associated with morbidity, survival, and performance of their daughters from birth through 305 d in milk of the first lactation and might represent factors affecting developmental programming of dairy heifers in utero.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

However, the commonly available poly-crystal TLDs (e.g., TLD-100) exhibit high inter-detector variability that requires individual calibration for high detection accuracy. To improve individual TLD tracking robustness, we developed an optical fingerprinting method to identify the TLD-100 chips.752 images were initially captured using a digital microscope camera to build a feature library for both facets of 376 TLD-100 chips. A median intensity thresholding method was used to segment images into foreground and background. The affine transformation was used to register the segmented images to the same position. The fingerprint of each image was calculated from its registered image. All fingerprints were then recorded in an Elasticsearch® search database. The TLD fingerprint match was tested three times when the library was established and repeated once 20 months later. All chips were irradiated at 0 Gy, 1 Gy, 4 Gy, and 8 Gy on a calibrated clinical MV linac to establish the individual calibration curve.The true positive rate of identifying TLDs based on their optical fingerprints was 100% at initialization of the inventory. After 20 months and multiple deployments for characterization, calibration, and dose measurement, the true positive match rate dropped to 99% with zero false positive matches. The TLDs exhibited high self-consistency in the dose-response test with R between 0.988 and 1 with linear regression.The TLD-100 chips surface textures are unique and sufficient to support accurate identification based on the optical fingerprinting. This method provides inexpensive and robust management of the TLDs for individual calibration and dosimetry.© 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677835>Effects of feeding live yeast at  dosages on performance and feeding behavior of dairy cows under heat stress.</a></h1><p>The objectives were to evaluate the effects of feeding different amounts of supplemental live yeast (LY) on performance and digestion of cows under heat stress. Sixty Holstein cows, 27 multiparous and 33 primiparous, were blocked by parity and milk yield in the first 20 d in milk (DIM) and randomly assigned to receive 0, 0.5, or 1.0 g/d of LY, resulting in daily intakes of 0, 14., and 37.6 billion cells, respectively, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CNCM I-1077 from 30 to 107 DIM. Cows were milked twice daily, dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield were measured daily, and milk components, body weight, and body condition were measured weekly. Blood was sampled weekly and plasma analyzed for concentrations of glucose, fatty acids, urea N, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, and acid-soluble protein. Digestibility of nutrients was measured in the last  wk of the experiment. Ruminal fluid was collected on  consecutive days 6 h after the morning feeding for measurements of pH, concentrations of short chain fatty acids, and NH-N. Feeding behavior was observed for 48 h on experiment d 21 and 63. The mean ambient temperature was 26.8°C, humidity was 83.%, and the temperature and humidity index ranged from 73 to 81. Treatment did not affect rectal temperature (38.9 ± 0.04°C) or DMI but increased yield of -corrected milk (ECM; 35. vs. 36.1 vs. 37. kg/d for 0, 0.5, and 1.0 g/d, respectively) and efficiency of conversion of DM into ECM (1.70, 1.79, and 1.83 for 0, 0.5, and 1 g/d, respectively). Feeding LY increased digestibility of crude protein (65.1 vs. 68.8 vs. 70.4%) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF; 47.5 vs. 49. vs. 55.%), and concentration of acetate (64.7 vs. 69.1 vs. 72. mM), which resulted in increased concentration of total short chain fatty acids in ruminal fluid (110.3 vs. 117.7 vs. 121.4 mM). Mean ruminal pH increased (5.99 vs. 6.03 vs. 6.26), and proportion of cows with pH <5.8 decreased linearly (42.9 vs. 34.9 vs. 7.7%) with increasing inclusion of LY. Concentrations of acute-phase proteins decreased with increasing amount of LY. Some aspects of feeding behavior were altered by LY, and meal size reduced quadratically (3., 3.5, and .9 kg of DM, respectively), whereas interval between rumination bouts tended to reduce linearly (122, 96.5, and 90.7 min, respectively) with increasing dose of LY. Chewing time per kilogram of NDF tended to increase linearly (71.6, 71.3, and 81.6 min/kg, respectively) with increasing dose of LY. The estimated net  for lactation of the diet increased 5.%, from 1.72 Mcal/kg of DM for 0 g of LY to 1.81 Mcal/kg for 1 g of LY. Feeding 1 g of LY/d to cows under heat stress increased yield of ECM and efficiency of feed conversion into ECM, improved diet digestibility, and increased ruminal fluid pH; these responses might be related either to direct effects of LY on ruminal microbial activity or to changes in feeding behavior that improved digestion of cows in heat stress.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

The ability of dCT to predict whole-lung values is unclear, especially for dual- CT (DECT) variables. Additionally, the effect of inspiration-related lung movement on CT variables has not yet been quantified.Eight domestic pigs were studied under general anaesthesia, including four following saline-lavage surfactant depletion (lung injury model). DECT, dCT and whole-lung images were collected at 12 ventilatory settings. Whole-lung single  scans images were collected during expiratory and inspiratory apnoeas at positive end-expiratory pressures from 0 to 20 cmHO. Means and distributions of CT variables were calculated for both dCT and whole-lung images. The cranio-caudal displacement of the anatomical slice was measured from whole-lung images.Mean CT density and volume fractions of soft tissue, gas, iodinated blood, atelectasis, poor aeration, normal aeration and overdistension correlated between dCT and the whole lung (r 0.75-0.94) with agreement between CT density distributions (r 0.89-0.97). Inspiration increased the matching between dCT and whole-lung values and was associated with a movement of 32% (SD 15%) of the imaged slice out of the scanner field-of-view. This effect introduced an artefactual increase in dCT mean CT density during inspiration, opposite to that caused by the underlying physiology.Overall, dCT closely approximates whole-lung aeration and density. This approximation is improved by inspiration where a decrease in CT density and atelectasis can be interpreted as physiological rather than artefactual.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674092>Alkali and Alkaline-Earth Cations in Complex with Small Bioorganic Ligands: Ab Initio Benchmark Calculations and Bond  Decomposition.</a></h1><p>Herein we report a computational database for the complexes of alkali (Li(I), Na(I), K(I)) and alkaline-earth cations (Be(II), Mg(II) and Ca(II)) with 25 small ligands with varying charge and donor atoms ("O", "N" and "S") that provides geometries and accurate bond energies useful to analyze metal-ligand interactions in proteins and nucleic acids. The role of the ligand→metal charge transfer, the equilibrium bond distance, the electronegativity of the donor atom, the ligand polarizability, and the relative stability of the complexes are discussed in detail. The interacting quantum atoms (IQA) method is used to decompose the binding  into electrostatic and quantum mechanical contributions. In addition, bond energies are also estimated by means of multipolar electrostatic calculations. No simple correlation exists between bond energies and structural/electronic descriptors unless the data are segregated by the type of ligand or metal. The electrostatic attraction of some molecules (H  O, NH 3 , CH 3 OH) towards the metal cations is well reproduced using their (unrelaxed) atomic multipoles, but the same comparison is much less satisfactory for other ligands ( e.g. , benzene, thiol/thiolate groups, etc.).

Gramicidin channels have emerged as a powerful system for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of membrane protein function regulation through changes in bilayer properties, which are reflected in the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution between nonconducting gramicidin monomers and conducting bilayer-spanning dimers. To improve our understanding of how subtle changes in bilayer thickness alter the gramicidin monomer and dimer distributions, we performed extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and fluorescence-quenching experiments on gramicidin A (gA). The free- calculations predicted a nonlinear coupling between the bilayer thickness and channel formation. The energetic barrier inhibiting gA channel formation was sharply increased in the thickest bilayer (1,-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). This prediction was corroborated by experimental results on gramicidin channel activity in bilayers of different thickness. To further explore the mechanism of channel formation, we performed extensive unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, which allowed us to observe spontaneous gA dimer formation in lipid bilayers. The simulations revealed structural rearrangements in the gA subunits and changes in lipid packing, as well as water reorganization, that occur during the dimerization process. Together, the simulations and experiments provide new, to our knowledge, insights into the process and mechanism of gramicidin channel formation, as a prototypical example of the bilayer regulation of membrane protein function.Copyright © 2019 Biophysical Society.

However, epidemiological studies have found this consumption to be associated with increased hazards, such as binge drinking, increased alcohol-related harm and risk of developing alcohol use disorder. The mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear, but much attention has been attributed to caffeine. However, taurine, another common ingredient in  drinks, has also been associated with the dopamine elevating properties of ethanol, and may in this respect contribute to the increased liability associated with the mixture of alcohol and  drinks. In the present study we measured locomotor activity, a phenomenon previously linked to the dopamine activating and reinforcing properties of the drug, following acute systemic administration with caffeine (1, 5, 15, 30 mg/kg), taurine (30, 60, 300, 600 mg/kg) and ethanol (1.75, .5, 3.25 g/kg), alone or in combination. We found that ethanol and caffeine, but not taurine, increased locomotion compared to vehicle. In addition, when combined with ethanol, caffeine, but not taurine, increased the locomotor stimulatory effect of ethanol. Furthermore, the combination of caffeine and taurine were able to further enhance the ethanol-induced locomotor response. Eleven days of intermittent caffeine exposure produced a sensitized response to the caffeine-induced locomotion, but did not alter the additive effect produced by the combination of caffeine and taurine on ethanol-induced locomotion. Based on the present study we suggest that the combination of caffeine and taurine, at a specific dose range, enhances the locomotor stimulatory properties of ethanol, a phenomenon previously linked to the reinforcing properties of the drug.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Log-binomial regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).3,5,6-trichloro--pyridinol (TCPY), a metabolite of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos methyl, and 4-nitrophenol, a metabolite of parathion and methyl parathion, were detected in nearly all women with geometric mean (95% CI) values of 3.17 (.82-3.56) and 18.66 (17.03-20.46) µg/g creatinine, respectively. 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a non-specific metabolite of several pyrethroids, and -isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine (IMPY), a diazinon metabolite, were detected in 19.8% and 16.1% of women, respectively. The remaining four pesticide biomarkers were detected in <10% of women. Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were more than 3 times more likely to deliver preterm than women in the lowest quartile: unadjusted RR (95% CI), 3.57 (1.65, 7.73). Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were also at increased risk of having a child born small for gestational age: RR (95% CI) adjusted for household income, maternal education, and maternal total  and meat intake, 3.81 (1.10, 13.21). Women with detectable concentrations of IMPY were at increased risk of having a child born with low birth weight compared to women with non-detectable concentrations: adjusted RR (95% CI), .13 (1.12, 4.08). We observed no association between any of the pesticide biomarkers and stunting at 1 or  years of age.Exposure to the insecticides parathion and diazinon during early pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we report the metal size-dependent charge transfer reversal, that is, electrons transfer from platinum single atoms to sulfur-doped carbons and the carbon supports conversely donate electrons to Pt when their size is expanded to ~1.5 nm cluster. The electron-enriched Pt nanoclusters are far more active than electron-deficient Pt single atoms for catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction, exhibiting only 11 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm and a high mass activity of 26.1 A mg at 20 mV, which is 38 times greater than that of commercial Pt/C. Our work manifests that the manipulation of metal size-dependent charge transfer between metal and support opens new avenues for developing high-active catalysts.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674132>Self-Supported, Sulfate Functionalized Nickel Hydroxides Nanoplates with Enhanced Wettability and Conductivity for High-Performance Supercapacitors.</a></h1><p>Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)  ) is promising for supercapacitor application due to its low cost and tunable electrochemical properties, but its performance is usually restricted by insufficient conductivity and surface reactivity. In this work, sulfate functionalized Ni(OH)  (SNO) nanoplates were in-situ grown on nickel foam (NF) via a green and facile one-step hydrothermal treatment of NF without need for external Ni source or surfactant addition. The resulting material showed 9.3 times higher areal capacity and 1.8 times higher rate capability than the sulfate-free control, and retained 81.3% capacity after 5000 cycles. When being used as the positive electrode in a hybrid supercapacitor, the SNO/NF//activated carbon system achieved >95% columbic efficiency, maximum  density of 3.59 W h m - and maximum power density of 44.63 W m - , outperforming most of the existing Ni-based supercapacitor. Detailed material characterization and density functional theory calculation revealed that the sulfate introduction expanded the layer spacing of Ni(OH)  and improved electrical conductivity and wettability to favor more efficient electrolyte diffusion, charge transfer and reactant adsorption. The high loading of reactive component and inherited porous structure also contributed to the superior capacitive performances of the SNO/NF electrodes. Therefore, the SNO/NF holds great potential for commercialized supercapacitor application.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Analytes were separated using an Zorbax Extend-Agilent C (1.8 μm, 4.6 × 30 mm) column following a simple methanol precipitation treatment. The mobile phase consisted of methanol and water containing 0.1% formic acid, and the total gradient program time was 1.5 min. Method validation results showed TH was linear in -500 ng/mL (r > 0.99), and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was  μg/mL. The intra-run and inter-run precision (coefficient of variation, CV) was within .80%, and the accuracy (relative error, RE) was within ±11.10%. Stability of TH was evaluated in different storage conditions, including short-term I-III, long-term I-III,  and 4 h in the artificial gastrointestinal tract, respectively. There was no obvious interference between TH and internal standards (IS). With the established Caco- monolayer permeability model, Papp(AB) of TH was calculated as 46.29 ± 8.31 × 10 cm/s, and the efflux ratio (ER) value was calculated as 0.22, indicating a high permeability character of TH. The transmembrane transport of TH followed the concentration-dependent, temperature-independent, and -free manner. Collectively, these characteristics indicate that TH is a highly permeable drug and the transport mechanism is mainly via passive diffusion.Copyright © 2019.

At present, the mainly B[a]A degradation methods used are photodegradation, bioremediation and traditional advanced oxidation, although they all have disadvantages. In this study, B[a]A was degraded by hydrodynamic cavitation (HC), chlorine dioxide (ClO), or an innovative combination of the two methods. According to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysed the degradation products and degradation pathway of B[a]A, with the kinetics of different degradation methods discussed. Under optimal conditions, HC combined with ClO oxidation can further degrade products to achieve ring cleavage. Compared with the two separate degradation process methods, the combined method exerts a synergistic effect on the degradation of B[a]A, with an enhancement factor of 1.48. Experimental results showed that the combination method can realize enhanced complete degradation of B[a]A, reduce ClO requirements, improve efficiency, reduce  consumption and produce less harmful products with ring cleavage achieved.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The present study analyzes the CO emission characteristics of selected subsectors. Results show that the electric and heat power sector is the major industrial CO emitter, and CO emissions of most sectors present huge inter-provincial and inter-regional differences. Then, the CO emission reduction responsibility of provincial-level industrial subsectors is confirmed by the decoupling model. Results show that the development of a low-carbon economy in the nonmetal sector is ideal, and the economic growth in Shanxi and Guizhou is moving toward a low-carbon and -saving mode. Moreover, the subsectors that each province should focus on are identified. Finally, constructive suggestions for policymakers to promote low-carbon economy and sustainable development are provided.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

MOF-74(Zn) as a template was grafted on the open metal sites with ethylenediamine (en) named MOF-74(Zn)-en to develop a highly selective and sensitive fluorescence detector for rapid determination of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). The obtained MOF-74(Zn)-en was well characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and showed ideal properties of photoluminescence. The fluorescence enhancement showed a good linear relationship with the concentrations of TBBPA in the range of 50-400 μg/L, and its limit of detection could reach to 0.75 μg/L. Furthermore, the possible sensing mechanism of the fluorescence enhancement could be attributed to Förster resonance  transfer (FRET). The results will provide a convenient and quick method for detection of TBBPA. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first case to detect TBBPA by fluorescence enhancement with MOF derivatives.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In swimming locomotion, a number of questions related to swimming energetics of an organism and how the energetic quantities scale with body size remain open, largely due to the difficulties with modeling and measuring the power production and consumption. Based on a comprehensive theoretical framework that incorporates cyclic muscle behavior, structural dynamics and swimming hydrodynamics, we perform extensive computational simulations and show that many of the outstanding problems in swimming energetics can be explained by considering the coupling between hydrodynamics and muscle contraction characteristics, as well as the trade-offs between the conflicting performance goals of sustained swimming speed U and cost of transport COT. Our results lead to three main conclusions: (1) in contrast to previous hypotheses, achieving optimal values of U and COT is independent of producing maximal power or efficiency; () muscle efficiency in swimming, in contrast to that in flying or running, decreases with increasing body size, consistent with muscle contraction characteristics; (3) the long-standing problem of two disparate patterns of longitudinal power output distributions in swimming fish can be reconciled by relating the two patterns to U-optimal or COT-optimal swimmers, respectively. We also provide further evidence that the use of tendons in caudal regions is beneficial from an energetic perspective. Our conclusions explain and unify many existing observations and are supported by computational data covering nine orders of magnitude in body size.</p></html>
