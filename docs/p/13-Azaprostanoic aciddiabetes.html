These studies were designed to determine if platelets obtained from diabetic subjects manifest increased metabolism of arachidonic acid to labile aggregating substances, such as thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and if they play a role in the enhanced platelet aggregation. Arachidonic acid stimulated TXA2 synthesis, as determined via radioimmunoassay of its stable metabolite TXB2, was significantly greater (p less than 0.01, n = 12) in platelet-rich plasma obtained from diabetic compared to matched controls. Arachidonic acid stimulated TXB2 synthesis in the diabetic platelet-rich plasma was positively correlated with the ambient fasting plasma glucose (r = 0.61, p less than 0.02, n = 15). Platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid (0.4-0.8 mM) was inhibited significantly less by  (p less than 0.04, n = 14), an antagonist of the actions of prostaglandin H2 or TXA2 on platelets, compared to matched controls. We conclude that platelets obtained from some diabetic subjects manifest increased metabolism of arachidonic acid to labile aggregating substances which may contribute to the enhanced platelet aggregation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3934501>Insulin and arachidonic acid metabolism in .</a></h1><p>The alterations in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin), a vasodilator antiaggregatory substance, and thromboxane A2, a vasoconstrictor proaggregatory substance, in  are reviewed in this article. When tested in vitro, platelet aggregation is enhanced in some patients with . The synthesis of thromboxane B2, the stable metabolite of thromboxane A2, by platelets is increased in patients with  compared with control subjects. This increased synthesis appears to play a role in the enhanced platelet aggregation since the latter can be reversed by aspirin treatment and in vitro by the thromboxane receptor-antagonist . Vascular prostacyclin synthesis is decreased in both patients and experimental animals with . Treatment of experimental animals with insulin reverses the decreased synthesis of prostacyclin. The etiology of the altered arachidonic acid metabolism remains uncertain but appears to be multifactorial and includes alterations in metabolic control and circulating immune complexes. The increased ratio of thromboxane A2 to prostacyclin, which favors an enhanced thrombotic state, may play a role in the accelerated vascular disease of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7452084>Increased platelet thromboxane synthesis in .</a></h1><p>Platelets obtained from some diabetic patients show enhanced in vitro platelet aggregation.

TXA2, and whether it may play a role in the enhanced platelet aggregation. Arachidonic acid (1 mM)-stimulated TXA2 synthesis, as determined via radioimmunoassay of its stable metabolite TXB2, was significantly greater (p < 0.01, n = 12) in platelet-rich plasma obtained from diabetic patients than in matched controls. Arachidonic acid-stimulated TXB2 synthesis in the diabetic platelet-rich plasma was positively correlated with the ambient fasting plasma glucose (r = 0.61, p < 0.02, n = 15). Platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid (0.4 to 0.8 mM) was inhibited significantly less than in matched controls by imidazole, a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor (p < 0.01, n = 11), and , an antagonist of the actions of PGH2 or TXA2 on platelets (p < 0.04, n = 14).

This study sought to determine if platelet obtained from insulin-dependent diabetic subjects synthesize increased quantities of the labile aggregating substance, thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and if it may play a role in the enhanced platelet aggregation. Arachidonic acid (1 mM)-stimulated TXA2 synthesis, as determined via radioimmunoassay of its stable metabolite TXB2, was significantly greater (P less than 0.01, N = 12) in platelet-rich plasma obtained from diabetics compared with matched controls.

Platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid (0.4-0.8 mM) was inhibited significantly less by  (P less than 0.04, N = 14), a competitive antagonist of the actions of prostaglandin H2 or TXA2 on platelets, compared with matched controls. The results support the notion that platelets obtained from some insulin-dependent diabetic subjects manifest increased synthesis of TXA2, which may contribute to the enhanced platelet aggregation.</p></html>
