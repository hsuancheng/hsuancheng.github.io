<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26964676>Development of a fluorescent cardiomyocyte specific binding probe.</a></h1><p>Cardiomyocytes are the major component of the heart. Their dysfunction or damage could lead to serious cardiovascular diseases, which have claimed numerous lives around the world. A molecule able to recognize cardiomyocytes would have significant value in diagnosis and treatment. Recently a novel peptide termed myocyte targeting peptide (MTP), with three residues of a non-natural amino acid biphenylalanine (Bip), showed good affinity to cardiomyocytes. Its selectivity towards cardiac tissues was concluded to be due to the ability of Bip to bind cardiac troponin I. With the aim of optimizing the affinity and the specificity towards cardiac myocytes and to better understand structure-activity relationship, a library of MTP derivatives was designed. Exploiting a fluorescent tag, the selectivity of the MTP analogs to myocardium over skeletal and stomach muscle tissues was assayed by fluorescence imaging. Among the tested sequences, the peptide probe Bip2, H-Lys(FITC)------Ser--Ser-Bip-Bip-NH2, displayed the best selectivity for cardiomyocytes.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate βAR gene polymorphism at codons 16 and 27 and their effect on asthma severity and response to treatment in asthmatic children.MethodsCase-control study was conducted on 156 children; 104 of them had bronchial asthma and 52 were healthy children (control group). Subjects of the study underwent history taking, clinical examination, pulmonary function tests, serum IgE level assessment, and identification of βAR-16 A46G and βAR-27 C79G polymorphism using PCR-Restriction Fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) test.ResultsThere was a higher frequency of - genotypes (odds ratio (OR)=6.57; confidence interval (CI): 2.42-18.81, P<0.001) and lower frequency of  (OR=4.7; CI: 2.05-10.95, P<0.001) among asthmatic children compared with that among controls at codon 16. The presence or absence of Gly16 or Glu27 either homozygous or heterozygous for both correlated with the grade of asthma severity. The presence of heterozygous - and Gln-Glu gives a better response to drug therapy than the presence of - and Glu-Glu genotypes at codons 16 and 27.ConclusionPolymorphism of βAR at codons 16 and 27 correlates with asthma severity and response to treatment in asthmatic children.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28844736>Structure and binding studies of proliferating cell nuclear antigen from Leishmania donovani.</a></h1><p>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) acts as a sliding clamp to support DNA replication and repair. The structure of PCNA from Leishmania donovani (LdPCNA) has been determined at 2.73Å resolution. Structure consists of six crystallographically independent molecules which form two trimeric rings. The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37Å. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces. In order to gain a stable packing, the rings are rotated by 42° about the pore axis and shifted by 7Å and tilted by 16° along the perpendicular direction to pore axis. This form of stacking reduced the effective diameter of the pore to 32Å. The sequence of LdPCNA consists of a long segment of 41 amino acid residues (186--Val-Ser-Asp--Ser-Thr-Lys-Ser-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Ala--Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-Pro-Leu-Ser--Lys-Tyr--Lys-Ala-Asp-Ser-Ser-Ala-Asn-Ala-Ile-226) whereas the corresponding segments in other PCNAs contain only eight residues corresponding to 186--Val-Ser-Asp-------224-Asn-Ala-Ile-226. The enhanced length of this segment in LdPCNA may influence its mode of interaction with DNA and other proteins. The dissociation constants obtained using real time binding studies with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for two peptides, Lys--Gln-Thr-Ser-Met-Thr-Asp-Phe-Tyr-His (P1) from human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1(CKI-1) and Lys-Thr-Gln---Leu-Asp-Ser-Phe-Phe-Thr-Val (P2) from flap endonuclease 1 (Fen-1) as well as with two small molecule inhibitors, (S)-4-(4-(2-amino-3-hydroxypropyl)-2, 6-diiodophenoxy) phenol hydrochloride (ADPH) and N-(3-methylthiophene-2-carboxylicacid)-N'-((3-hydroxy-2-naphthalenyl) methylene) hydrazide (MCMH) are 0.29±0.09μM, 0.37±0.08μM, 0.35±0.09μM and 1.20±0.08μM respectively. The corresponding values obtained using fluorescence spectroscopic methods were 0.22±0.06μM, 0.68±0.07μM, 0.44±0.07μM and 0.75±0.05μM respectively.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The nanocapsules were prepared by a solvent displacement technique and exhibited satisfactory drug and iron oxide loading efficiency, high colloidal stability, and sustained drug release properties. Drug release also proved responsive to an alternating magnetic field. Magnetophoresis experiments showed that the magnetic responsiveness of the nanocapsules depended on their SPION content. The PTX-loaded nanocapsules exhibited comparable to free PTX cytotoxicity against the A549 lung cancer cell line at 24 h of incubation but higher cytotoxicity than free drug at 48 h of incubation. The conjugation of a cysteine-modified TAT peptide (HCys-Tyr---Lys-Lys--Gln---NH) on the surface of the nanocapsules resulted to highly increased uptake of nanocapsules by cancer cells, as well as to profound improvement of their cytotoxicity against the cancer cells. The results obtained justify further investigation of the prospects of these multifunctional PLA-PEG nanocapsules as a targeted delivery system of paclitaxel.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212872>Correlation between the GP78 Gene Polymorphism and Coronary Atherosclerotic Heart Disease.</a></h1><p>To study the correlation between the GP78 gene polymorphism and blood fat, blood glucose, blood pressure and coronary atherosclerotic heart disease.A total of 72 patients with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease were selected as the observation group, and 68 healthy participants were selected as the control group.

Numerous studies have been reported aiming at the fractionation and characterization of the many molecular species present in the extract, but more efforts are still required to obtain sufficient quantities of the various purified protease forms for detailed physicochemical, enzymatic and structural characterization. In this work, we describe an efficient strategy towards the purification of at least eight enzymatic forms. Thus, following rapid fractionation on a SP-Sepharose FF column, two sub-populations with proteolytic activity were obtained: the unbound (termed acidic) and bound (termed basic) bromelain fractions. Following reversible modification with monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG), both fractions were further separated on Q-Sepharose FF and SP-Sepharose FF, respectively. This procedure yielded highly purified molecular species, all titrating ca. 1 mol of thiol group per mole of enzyme, with distinct biochemical properties. N-terminal sequencing allowed identifying at least eight forms with proteolytic activity. The basic fraction contained previously identified species, i.e. basic bromelain forms 1 and 2, ananain forms 1 and 2, and comosain (MEROPS identifier: C01.027). Furthermore, a new proteolytic species, showing similarities with basic bomelain forms 1 and 2, was discovered and termed bromelain form 3. The two remaining species were found in the acidic bromelain fraction and were arbitrarily named acidic bromelain forms 1 and 2. Both, acidic bromelain forms 1, 2 and basic bromelain forms 1, 2 and 3 are glycosylated, while ananain forms 1 and 2, and comosain are not. The eight protease forms display different amidase activities against the various substrates tested, namely small synthetic chromogenic compounds (DL-BAPNA and Boc-Ala-Ala--pNA), fluorogenic compounds (like Boc-Gln-Ala--AMC, Z--AMC and Z-Phe--AMC), and proteins (azocasein and azoalbumin), suggesting a specific organization of their catalytic residues. All forms are completely inhibited by specific cysteine and cysteine/serine protease inhibitors, but not by specific serine and aspartic protease inhibitors, with the sole exception of pepstatin A that significantly affects acidic bromelain forms 1 and 2. For all eight protease forms, inhibition is also observed with 1,10-phenanthrolin, a metalloprotease inhibitor. Metal ions (i.e. Mn, Mg and Ca) showed various effects depending on the protease under consideration, but all of them are totally inhibited in the presence of Zn. Mass spectrometry analyses revealed that all forms have a molecular mass of ca. 24 kDa, which is characteristic of enzymes belonging to the papain-like proteases family. Far-UV CD spectra analysis further supported this analysis. Interestingly, secondary structure calculation proves to be highly reproducible for all cysteine proteases of the papain family tested so far (this work; see also Azarkan et al., 2011; Baeyens-Volant et al., 2015) and thus can be used as a test for rapid identification of the classical papain fold.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
