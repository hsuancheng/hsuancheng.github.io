<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7867945>A fruiting body-specific cDNA, mfbAc, from the mushroom Lentinus edodes encodes a high-molecular- cell-adhesion protein containing an --Asp motif.</a></h2><p>A cDNA clone (designated mfbAc), encoding 2157 amino acids (aa), was isolated from a mature fruiting-body cDNA library of the edible mushroom Lentinus edodes. The mfbA transcript was abundant in mature fruiting bodies, detectable in immature fruiting bodies but absent in earlier developmental stages and in the vegetative mycelium. Although more abundant in the pileus than the stipe, only low levels were found in the gill tissue. The deduced MFBA protein (234.5 kDa) contained a cell-surface attachment-promoting --Asp (RGD) motif. MFBA was produced in Escherichia coli using a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion vector, but it was cleaved into four fragments even in a protease-deficient host. A 425-aa MFBA peptide containing the RGD motif (named MFBA(582-1006) peptide) was successfully produced using the phage T7 expression system. This MFBA(582-1006) peptide exhibited a cell adhesion and spreading activity toward mammalian cells. This activity of the MFBA fragment was competitively inhibited by the ---Asp-Ser-Pro peptide but not by the ---Glu-Ser-Pro peptide, showing that the RGD motif of MFBA is essential for the cell-binding activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9339565>Generation of basidiomycetous hyphal cell-aggregates by addition of the --Asp motif-containing fragment of high-molecular- cell-adhesion protein MFBA derived from the basidiomycete Lentinus edodes.</a></h2><p>The --Asp (RGD) motif-containing fragment of high-molecular- cell-adhesion protein MFBA derived from Lentinus edodes caused a significant aggregation of the fragmented hyphal cells of Schizophyllum commune. This fungal cell-aggregation was inhibited by a previous treatment of the cells with the ---Asp-Ser-Pro peptide, but not with the ---Glu-Ser-Pro peptide, showing that the RGD motif is essential for the cell-aggregation activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8828796>Chemical conjugation of -Pro--Pro. Tetrapeptide to low molecular  urokinase.</a></h2><p>Two low molecular  urokinase derivatives were obtained by covalent coupling of a synthetic -Pro--Pro tetrapeptide to peptide A of low molecular  urokinase and exchanging the native peptide A of low molecular  urokinase with -Pro--Pro-peptide A to obtain derivative I or direct conjugation of -Pro--Pro tetrapeptide to low molecular  urokinase to obtain derivative II. In caseinolytic assay, fibrin can stimulate the two derivatives to activate plasminogen. But the two derivatives showed different kinetic behaviors. The derivative I displayed immediate onset of lysis and derivative II displayed a lag phase.</p></html>
