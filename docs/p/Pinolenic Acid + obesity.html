We hypothesized that unsaturated FA could alleviate saturated FA-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurring in intestinal secretory goblet cells, and consequently the reduced synthesis and secretion of mucins that form the protective mucus barrier. To investigate this hypothesis, we treated well-differentiated human colonic LS174T goblet cells with palmitic  (PAL)-the most commonly used inducer of lipotoxicity in in vitro systems-or -9, -6, or -3 unsaturated fatty acids alone or in co-treatment with PAL, and measured the impact of such treatments on ER stress and Muc2 production. Our results showed that only eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids protect goblet cells against ER stress-mediated altered Muc2 secretion induced by PAL, whereas neither  nor -9 and -6 FA are able to provide such protection. We conclude that EPA and DHA could represent potential therapeutic nutrients against the detrimental lipotoxicity of saturated fatty acids, associated with type 2 diabetes and  or inflammatory bowel disease. These in vitro data remain to be explored in vivo in a context of dietary .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191316>Dimethyl Sulfoxide Decreases Levels of Oxylipin Diols in Mouse Liver.</a></h2><p>Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is widely used as a solvent and cryopreservative in laboratories and considered to have many beneficial health effects in humans. Oxylipins are a class of biologically active metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that have been linked to a number of diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of DMSO on oxylipin levels in mouse liver. Liver tissue from male mice (C57Bl6/N) that were either untreated or injected with 1% DMSO at 18 weeks of age was analyzed for oxylipin levels using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). A decrease in oxylipin diols from linoleic  (LA, C18:2n6),  (ALA, C18:3n3) and docosahexeanoic  (DHA, C22:6n3) was observed 2 h after injection with DMSO. In contrast, DMSO had no effect on the epoxide precursors or other oxylipins including those derived from arachidonic  (C20:4n6) or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5n3). It also did not significantly affect the diol:epoxide ratio, suggesting a pathway distinct from, and potentially complementary to, soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHI). Since oxylipins have been associated with a wide array of pathological conditions, from arthritis pain to , our results suggest one potential mechanism underlying the apparent beneficial health effects of DMSO. They also indicate that caution should be used in the interpretation of results using DMSO as a vehicle in animal experiments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27025974>From the α to the ω-3: Breaking the link between impaired fetal growth and adult cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerotic vascular disease is an important cause of premature morbidity and mortality. An extensive body of epidemiologic data links impaired fetal growth, evidenced by reductions in birth weight, with a higher risk for cardiovascular disease in adulthood. This association appears to be at least partially independent of established cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. There is currently no clinically established strategy to prevent cardiovascular events secondary to being born with poor fetal growth. This review summarizes recent evidence that suggests that ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be beneficial for this indication; in particular being associated with more marked reductions in blood pressure and subclinical atherosclerosis in people who were born with poor fetal growth, than in those with healthy birth weight. Possible mechanisms, and the evidence base required to support the implementation of dietary guidelines specific to people born with impaired fetal growth are also described.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

HF diets were supplemented with ALA, EPA, or DHA (1% w/w) and given to C57BL/6J mice for 16 weeks and to Ob/Ob mice for 6 weeks. In C57BL/6J mice, EPA reduced plasma cholesterol (-20%), limited fat mass accumulation (-23%) and adipose cell hypertrophy (-50%), and reduced plasma leptin concentration (-60%) compared with HF-fed mice. Furthermore, mice supplemented with EPA exhibited a higher insulin sensitivity (+24%) and glucose tolerance (+20%) compared with HF-fed mice. Similar effects were observed in EPA-supplemented Ob/Ob mice, although fat mass accumulation was not prevented. By contrast, in comparison with HF-fed mice, DHA did not prevent fat mass accumulation, increased plasma leptin concentration (+128%) in C57BL/6J mice, and did not improve glucose homeostasis in C57BL/6J and Ob/Ob mice. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, DHA stimulated leptin expression whereas EPA induced adiponectin expression, suggesting that improved leptin/adiponectin balance may contribute to the protective effect of EPA. In conclusion, supplementation with EPA, but not ALA and DHA, could preserve glucose homeostasis in an obesogenic environment and limit fat mass accumulation in the early stage of weight gain.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29315384>Induction of Stress Signaling In Vitro and Suppression of Gonadotropin Secretion by Free Fatty Acids in Female Mouse Gonadotropes.</a></h2><p>An emerging body of evidence supports the concept that the pituitary is a site for integration of multiple physiological and metabolic signals that inform and modulate endocrine pathways. Multiple endocrine mediators of energy balance and adiposity are known to impinge on the neuroendocrine axis regulating reproduction. Observations in humans show that  is correlated with decreased gonadotropin secretion, and studies have also suggested that pituitary sensitivity to stimulation by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is decreased in obese individuals. Free fatty acids are a potential mediator of adiposity and energy balance, but their impact as an endocrine modulator of pituitary function has not been closely examined. We evaluated the impact of free fatty acids on a pituitary gonadotrope cell line and in primary pituitary cultures of female mice. We show that increasing physiologically relevant doses of the monounsaturated ω-9 fatty  oleate induces cellular stress and increases production of reactive oxygen species in a mouse gonadotrope cell line. In contrast, the unsaturated ω-3 α- and ω-6 linoleic fatty acids do not have this effect. Additionally, oleate can activate immediate-early gene expression independent of GnRH stimulation but has a negative impact on GnRH induction and expression of the gonadotropin subunit gene Lhb. Further, oleate suppresses gonadotropin secretion in response to pulsatile stimulation by GnRH. These results indicate that free fatty acids can directly alter gonadotropin gene expression and secretion in response to GnRH and may provide a link between energy sensing and reproduction.Copyright © 2018 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27501823>The dietary effect of milk sphingomyelin on the lipid metabolism of obese/diabetic KK-A(y) mice and wild-type C57BL/6J mice.</a></h2><p>Purified milk sphingomyelin (SM) was obtained from lipid concentrated butter serum (LC-BS) by successive separations involving solvent fractionation, selective saponification, and silicic  column chromatography. The SM obtained was given to obese/diabetic KK-A(y) mice and wild-type C57BL/6J mice. SM supplementation significantly increased fecal lipids paralleled with a decrease in non-HDL cholesterol levels in the serum and neutral lipids and in cholesterol levels in the livers of KK-A(y) mice. The reduction of liver lipid levels also resulted in a decrease in the total fatty  content of the KK-A(y) mice livers, while n-3 fatty acids derived from the conversion of α- (18:3n-3) increased due to SM supplementation. In contrast to the KK-A(y) mice, little change in the serum and liver lipids was observed in wild-type C57BL/6J mice.

We used food frequency questionnaire data to quantify trimester-specific intake of N-3 , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA); N-6 linoleic  and arachidonic  (AA); and N-6:N-3 (AA:EPA+DHA), which accounts for the fact that the two PUFA families have opposing effects on physiology. Next, we used multivariable linear regression models that accounted for maternal education and parity, and child's age, sex and pubertal status, to examine associations of PUFA intake with the offspring outcomes. In models where BMI z-score was the outcome, we also adjusted for height z-score. We found that higher second trimester intake of EPA, DHA and AA were associated with lower offspring BMI and height z-score. For example, each 1-s.d. increment in second trimester EPA intake corresponded with 0.25 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.47) z-scores lower BMI and 0.20 (0.05, 0.36) z-scores lower height. Accounting for height z-score in models where BMI z-score was the outcome attenuated estimates [e.g., EPA: -0.16 (-0.37, 0.05)], suggesting that this relationship was driven by slower linear growth rather than excess adiposity. Maternal PUFA intake was not associated with the offspring metabolic biomarkers. Our findings suggest that higher PUFA intake during mid-pregnancy is associated with lower attained height in offspring during peripuberty. Additional research is needed to elucidate mechanisms and to confirm findings in other populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246284>Consumption of -enriched diacylglycerol induces increase in dietary fat oxidation compared with -enriched triacylglycerol: A randomized, double-blind trial.</a></h2><p>Fat metabolism is an important consideration in . -enriched diacylglycerol (ALA-DAG), which mainly occurs as ALA esterifies to 1,3-diacyl-sn-glycerol (1,3-DAG), has beneficial effects on fat metabolism and body weight compared with triacylglycerol (TAG). Moreover, compared with ALA-TAG, ALA-DAG enhances β-oxidation activity in the small intestine and liver in rodents. We hypothesized that ALA-DAG consumption may increase dietary fat oxidation compared with ALA-TAG in humans. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted a randomized double-blind cross-over trial in 17 normal and moderately obese men and women (BMI: 25.7±2.0 kg/m, mean±SD). Each participant was assigned to a 4-week intervention period with 2.5 g/day of ALA-DAG or ALA-TAG consumption, followed by a 4-week washout period between consumption of each diet. Dietary fat oxidation, assessed based on the CO recovery rate in the breath, was significantly increased by ALA-DAG consumption compared with ALA-TAG consumption (17.0±4.5% and 14.1±5.9%, respectively, P<.05). In addition, ALA-DAG consumption significantly decreased the visceral fat area compared with ALA-TAG (102.9±51.9 cm and 110.9±51.7 cm, respectively; P<.05).

It is now becoming clear that relatively few studies have adequately assessed the effects of LNA, independent of . The purpose of this work was to compare the effects of several fat-enriched but non-obesigenic diets on inflammation to provide a more accurate assessment of LNA's ability to induce inflammation. Specifically, 8-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice were fed either saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), LNA, or  enriched diets (50 % Kcal from fat, 22 % wt/wt) for 4 weeks. Chow and high-fat, hyper-caloric diets were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant markers from epididymal fat, liver, and plasma were measured along with food intake and body weights. Mice fed the high SFA, MUFA, and high-fat diets exhibited increased pro-inflammatory markers in liver and adipose tissue; however, mice fed LNA for four weeks did not display significant changes in pro-inflammatory or pro-coagulant markers in epididymal fat, liver, or plasma. The present study demonstrates that LNA alone is insufficient to induce inflammation. Instead, it is more likely that hyper-caloric diets are responsible for diet-induced inflammation possibly due to adipose tissue remodeling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28870233>Free fatty acids profile among lean, overweight and obese non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients: a case - control study.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) given its association with  and diabetes may perhaps exert distinct free fatty acids (FFA) pattern, but the understanding of this phenomenon is limited. To this effect, we evaluated FFA profiles among healthy subjects and NAFLD patients stratified by body weight, to identify FFA valuable for early diagnosis of NAFLD.Serum FFA profiles of healthy and NAFLD (lean, overweight and obese) subjects was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and distinctions in FFA patterns were evaluated using one-way ANOVA while Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and logistic regression models were used to explore FFA significant for diagnosing NAFLD.NAFLD patients presented significantly higher (P < 0.05) serum FFA profiles compared to healthy controls (HC). While total FFA profiles were insignificantly different between lean (2093.33 ± 558.11 μg/ml) and overweight (2420.81 ± 555.18 μg/ml) NAFLD patients, obese NAFLD (2739.01 ± 810.35 μg/ml) presented most significantly elevated (P < 0.05) total FFA profiles compared with HC.

Lipid disorders, a constant feature of CKD, might contribute to this state. The aim of this study was to evaluate n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) composition in CKD patients treated with dialysis, in comparison to the general population and to assess possible associations between the n-3 PUFA profile and anthropometric variables. Thirty-three prevalent dialysis patients were studied and compared with an age- and sex-adjusted control group of 22 patients. Fatty  composition in serum was analyzed by gas chromatography with a mass spectrometer detector (GC-MS) and anthropometric measures were assessed by bioimpedance spectroscopy. The fatty  profile of dialyzed patients was characterized by a significantly lower percentage content of n-3 PUFA. For α- (ALA), it was 0.21 ± 0.09% in dialysis patients versus 0.33 ± 0.11% in the control group (p < .001). For eicosapentanoic  (EPA), 0.59 ± 0.23% versus 1.15 ± 0.87% (p < .001), and for docosahexaenoic  (DHA) 1.11 ± 0.50% versus 1.75 ± 0.87% (p < .001), respectively. The amount of n-3 PUFA decreased with time on dialysis and it correlated positively with body fat mass. For DHA, this correlation was r = .48 (p < .01) and for EPA r = .40 (p < .05). Patients with CKD have a relatively low content of n-3 PUFA which may contribute to their high cardiovascular risk.

We therefore compared the effects of select lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins produced from α- (ALA, C18:3 n-3), linoleic  (LA, C18:2 n-6), and arachidonic  (AA, C20:4 n-6) on key adipocyte functions that are altered in . Individual oxylipins were added to the culture medium of differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes for 6days. Lipid accumulation was subsequently determined by Oil Red O staining, while Western blotting was used to measure levels of proteins associated with lipid metabolism and characteristics of adipocyte functionality. Addition of all oxylipins at 30nM was sufficient to significantly decrease triglyceride accumulation in lipid droplets, and higher levels completely blocked lipid production. Our results establish that lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins produced from 18-carbon PUFA differentially affect multiple adipocyte processes associated with lipid storage and adipokine production. However, these effects are not due to the oxylipins blocking adipocyte maturation and thus globally suppressing all adipocyte characteristics. Furthermore, these oxylipin species decrease the lipid content of adipocytes regardless from which precursor fatty  or lipoxygenase they were derived. Consequently, adipocyte characteristics can be altered through the ability of oxylipins to selectively modulate levels of proteins involved in both lipid metabolism and adipokine production.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to address this question in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) population. Dietary intakes of participants without T2D (n=2,139) were assessed using the validated food frequency questionnaire. To assess the risk of T2D after 6 years of follow-up, we used multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models. Three major dietary fat patterns were: (1) high amounts of dietary cholesterol, saturated fats, oleic , linoleic , , and trans fats; (2) high amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated fats; and (3) high amounts of dietary cholesterol and saturated fats. Dietary total fat intake hazard ratio [HR=1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.77~2.23 and HR=0.69, 95% CI=0.27~1.76, in the second and third tertile, respectively] was not related to the development of T2D. Animal- and plant-based dietary fat intakes were additionally not related to the risk of T2D. After adjustment for confounding variables, there was no significant association between dietary fat pattern score and T2D incidence. Whereas, the third pattern had a borderline negative association with diabetes development (HR=0.56, 95% CI=0.29~1.07). These novel data suggest that dietary fat composition may modify the risk of T2D incidence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26879142>Linoleic  and stearic  elicit opposite effects on AgRP expression and secretion via TLR4-dependent signaling pathways in immortalized hypothalamic N38 cells.</a></h2><p>The regulation of food intake is a promising way to combat . It has been implicated that various fatty acids exert different effects on food intake and body weight. However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of linoleic  (LA) and stearic  (SA) on agouti-related protein (AgRP) expression and secretion in immortalized mouse hypothalamic N38 cells and to explore the likely underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that LA inhibited, while SA stimulated AgRP expression and secretion of N38 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, LA suppressed the protein expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), phosphorylation levels of JNK and IKKα/β, suggesting the inhibition of TLR4-dependent inflammation pathway. However, the above mentioned inhibitory effects of LA were eliminated by TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In contrast, SA promoted TLR4 protein expression and activated TLR4-dependent inflammation pathway, with elevated ratio of p-JNK/JNK. While TLR4 siRNA reversed the stimulatory effects of SA on AgRP expression and TLR4-dependent inflammation. Moreover, we found that TLR4 was also involved in LA-enhanced and SA-impaired leptin/insulin signal pathways in N38 cells. In conclusion, our findings indicated that LA elicited inhibitory while SA exerted stimulatory effects on AgRP expression and secretion via TLR4-dependent inflammation and leptin/insulin pathways in N38 cells. These data provided a better understanding of the mechanism underlying fatty acids-regulated food intake and suggested the potential role of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids such as LA in reducing food intake and treating .Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Adipogenic differentiation of adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) plays an important role in the development of adipose tissue. In order to determine the effect of trans fatty acids on adipogenic differentiation in ADSCs, cells were treated with linoelaidic , as well as linoleic  and . We found that linoelaidic  significantly increased the lipid droplet formation and triglyceride content compared with linoleic  and . Linoelaidic  also down-regulated the levels of β-catenin in cells and inhibited the accumulation of β-catenin in cell nuclei. Lithium chloride, an activator of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, antagonized the enhancement of linoelaidic  on adipogenesis and up-regulated the levels of β-catenin in ADSCs. These results indicated that linoelaidic  could enhance the adipogenic differentiation in ADSCs in vitro, which is partly due to the suppression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the study was to determine the role that the dietary n-6:n-3 plays in non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease (NAFLD) and colitis development. We hypothesized that reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 would hinder the development of NAFLD and colitis. Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed high-fat diets, differing in the n-6:n-3 (1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1), for 20 weeks. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the hepatic phospholipid arachidonic  (AA):eicosapentaenoic  and AA:docosahexaenoic . Hepatic metabolism, inflammatory signaling, macrophage polarization, gene expression of inflammatory mediators, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and oxidative capacity were assessed as well as colonic inflammatory signaling, and gene expression of inflammatory mediators and tight-junction proteins. Although reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 lowered the hepatic phospholipid AA:eicosapentaenoic  and AA:docosahexaenoic  in a dose-dependent manner and mildly influenced inflammatory signaling, it did not significantly attenuate NAFLD development. Furthermore, the onset of NAFLD was not paired to colitis development or changes in tight-junction protein gene expression. In conclusion, reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 did not attenuate NAFLD progression; nor is it likely that colitis, or gut permeability, plays a role in NAFLD initiation in this model.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The mean number of mature oocytes did not differ significantly between the BMI groups, the percent of Metaphase II (MII) oocytes was inversely associated with the BMI (r=-0.21, p=0.03). Kruskal-Wallis test showed that the distribution of good quality embryos' percentages were different in at least two categories of studied BMI groups (p=0.009, p=0.02).

We tested whether changes in fatty  (FAs) classes measured in erythrocytes are associated with increased risk of diabetic VED along with related risk factors.We assessed erythrocyte FAs composition, lipid peroxidation parameters and inflammatory cytokines among 72 T2D men with VED, 78 T2D men without VED and 88 healthy volunteers with similar age. Biochemical, hepatic, lipid and hormonal profiles were measured.T2D people with VED had significant decrease in the indexes of Δ6-desaturase and elongase activities compared to the other studied groups. The same group of participants displayed lower erythrocytes levels of dihomo-γ- (C20:3n-6) (P < .001), precursor of the messenger molecule PGE1 mainly involved in promoting erection. Moreover, absolute SFAs concentration and HOMA IR levels were higher in T2D people with VED when compared to controls and associated with impaired NO concentration (1.43 vs 3.30 ng/L, P < .001). Our results showed that IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly increased and positively correlated with MDA levels only in T2D people with VED (r = 0.884, P = .016 and r = 0.753, P = .035; respectively) suggesting a decrease in the relative availability of vasodilator mediators and an activation of vasoconstrictors release.Our findings show that the deranged FAs metabolism represents a potential marker of VED in progress, or at least an indicator of increased risk within men with T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413241>Elaeagnus mollis Oil Attenuates Non-alcoholic Fatty Disease in High-fat Diet Induced Obese Mice via Modifying the Expression of Lipid Metabolismrelated Genes.</a></h2><p>Elaeagnus mollis oil (EMO), which is a type of plant oil, was extracted from the nuts of Elaeagnus mollis Diels that is known as a precious woodyoilcrop in China. The present study investigated the ameliorative effects of EMO on high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and explored relative regulation mechanism. The analysis of EMO fatty acids showed that EMO rich in unsaturated fatty acids (92.07%), such as linoleic  (48.24%), oleic  (34.20%) and  (7.57%). In addition, supplementation of EMO could ameliorate the increase in body weight, fat weight, and abnormal serum lipids induced by high-fat diet. A further important implication is that the levels of serum ALT, serum AST, hepatic TG, TC, SOD, GSH/GSSG ration and MDA were improved after supplementing with EMO. All these changes may be due to the ability of EMO to inhibit fatty  synthesis via reducing the mRNA expression of SREBP-1c, PPARγ and FAS, and elevate fatty  oxidation by increasing the mRNA expression of PPARα and CPT-1. Meanwhile, our results also showed that endogenously synthesized n-3 PUFAs could significantly increase after treating with EMO. In conclusion, the results suggested that EMO could be regarded as a healthy food for preventing NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28452961>Relationship of the Reported Intakes of Fat and Fatty Acids to Body Weight in US Adults.</a></h2><p>Dietary fat composition may modulate energy expenditure and body weight. Little is known about the relationship between fatty  intake and body weight at a population level. The purposes of this study were to compare intakes of energy, macronutrients, and individual fatty acids across BMI categories (1) for the US adult population and, (2) by sociodemographic groups. Reported dietary intake data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and What We Eat in America (WWEIA) surveys in the years 2005-2012 were analyzed. Overall, we found that the reported intake of carbohydrate, protein, total fat, total saturated fat (as well as long-chain saturated fatty acids 14:0-18:0), and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were positively associated with BMI; while lauric  (a medium-chain saturated fatty , 12:0) and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (as well as all individual PUFAs) were not associated with BMI. Non-Hispanic black individuals demonstrated a negative association between BMI and energy intake and a positive association between total PUFAs, linoleic  (LA), α- (ALA) and BMI. Individuals with less than a high school education showed a negative association between BMI and DHA. Mexican-Americans reported intakes with no association between BMI and energy, any macronutrient, or individual fatty acids. These findings support those of experimental studies demonstrating fatty -dependent associations between dietary fatty  composition and body weight. Notably, we observed divergent results for some sociodemographic groups which warrant further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26694605>A High-Fat, High-Oleic Diet, But Not a High-Fat, Saturated Diet, Reduces Hepatic α- and Eicosapentaenoic  Content in Mice.</a></h2><p>Considerable research has focused upon the role of linoleic  (LNA; 18:2n-6) as a competitive inhibitor of α- (ALA; 18:3n-3) metabolism; however, little data exist as to the impact of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) on ALA metabolism. We tested the hypothesis that a high SFA diet, compared to a high MUFA (oleic  18:1n-9) diet, reduces ALA conversion to long chain n-3 fatty acids. Mice were fed for 12 weeks on three diets: (1) a control, 16 % fat energy diet consisting of similar levels of SFA and MUFA (2) a 50 % fat energy high MUFA energy diet (35 % MUFA and 7 % SFA) or (3) a 50 % fat energy, high SFA energy diet (34 % SFA, 8 % MUFA). ALA and LNA content remained constant. Analysis of hepatic lipids demonstrated a selective reduction (40 %) in ALA but not LNA and a 35 % reduction in eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; 20:5n-3) in the high MUFA mice compared to the other groups. Lower content of ALA was reflected in the neutral lipid fraction, while smaller levels of phospholipid esterified EPA and docosapentaenoic  (DPA; 22:5n-3) were evident. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) content was elevated by the high SFA diet. Expression of Fads1 (Δ5 desaturase) and Fads2 (Δ6 desaturase) was elevated by the high MUFA and reduced by the high SFA diet. These data indicate that a high MUFA diet, but not a high SFA diet, reduces ALA metabolism and point to selective hepatic disposition of ALA versus LNA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25733475>Plasma nutrient biomarkers are associated with waist-to-height ratio in youth with type 1 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Plasma fatty acids (FAs) and micronutrients have been associated with central  in adults; however, previous studies of these associations in adults have yielded mixed results. In addition, no comparable research has been conducted among youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D).We investigated the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between plasma nutrient biomarkers and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) in youth with T1D.These analyses included 1324 youth aged 3-20 y at T1D diagnosis with a baseline visit in the SEARCH (Search for Diabetes in Youth) Study and a subset of 1178 of these youth with a follow-up visit an average of 23 mo (range: 16-40 mo) after their baseline visit.

The importance of plant-based omega-3 fatty  (α-, ALA) intake in fetal growth has not been previously examined.We sought to determine the association of maternal ALA intake during pregnancy with birth weight and body composition of the offspring.Mothers and their newborn infants ( = 224) were recruited from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Australia. Maternal diet during pregnancy was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Plasma fatty  composition was analyzed in a subset of mothers ( = 41). Newborn body composition was assessed using air-displacement plethysmography. All analyses were adjusted for gestational age, sex, physical activity, and total energy intake.Dietary fatty  intakes were positively associated with plasma phospholipid fatty acids for total omega-3 fatty acids (= 0.452, = 0.003), ALA (= 0.339, = 0.03), linoleic  (= 0.353, = 0.03), eicosapentaenoic  (= 0.407, = 0.009), and docosahexaenoic  (= 0.388, = 0.01). Higher maternal intake of ALA (% total fat) was associated with higher offspring birth weight [189.7-g increase per 1% higher ALA (95% CI: 14, 365 g); = .04], although individually neither newborn fat mass nor fat-free mass was significant. Birth weight increased across tertiles of maternal ALA intake ( = 0.05), with birth weight being 221 g (95% CI: 12, 429 g) higher in those with the highest maternal ALA intake compared with those with the lowest intake (= 0.04). Mothers of infants born small for gestational age ( = 32) had a lower ALA intake than those born appropriate for gestational age ( = 162) or large for gestational age [( = 21); = 0.05].In otherwise healthy women giving birth at a major tertiary hospital in Australia, intake of ALA during pregnancy is associated with higher offspring birth weight.

This review aims to summarize the state of the art about the utilization of CLNA as a functional ingredient. Indeed, in vitro and in vivo studies reported that CLNA exerted anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-obese, and antioxidant activities. However, CLNA has not been tested in humans. These compounds are naturally present in meat and milk fat from ruminants but the highest concentrations are found in vegetable oils. Their incorporation in foodstuffs is one of the most effective strategies to elaborate CLNA-enriched products together with the microbiological production. Lactobacilli, propionibacteria, and bifidobacteria strains have been assayed to produce CLNA isomers but at the current moment there are not high CLNA concentration products elaborated using these strains. Furthermore, it is known that CLNA isomers are highly prone to oxidation when compared with linoleic  and CLA, but the possible effects of elaboration and storage on high CLNA productsare unknown.The utilization of CLNA as a functional compound still remains a challenge and requires more research to address all of its technological and bioactivity aspects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26930155>Hypolipidemic Activity of Peony Seed Oil Rich in α-, is Mediated Through Inhibition of Lipogenesis and Upregulation of Fatty  β-Oxidation.</a></h2><p>Peony seed oil (PSO) is a new resource food rich in α-(ALA) (38.66%). The objective of this study was to assess the modulatory effect of PSO on lipid metabolism. Lard oil, safflower oil (SFO), and PSO were fed to wistar rats with 1% cholesterol in the diet for 60 d. Serum and liver lipids showed significant decrease in total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in PSO fed rats compared to lard oil and SFO fed rats.

The underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study we investigated the effects of chronic treatment of olanzapine on the fatty  composition of plasma in mice.Twenty 8-week female Balb/c mice were randomly assigned to two groups: the OLA group and the control group. After treatment with olanzapine (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle intraperitoneally for 8 weeks, fasting glucose, insulin levels and oral glucose tolerance test were determined. Effects on plasma fatty  profile and plasma indices of D5 desaturase, D6 desaturase and SCD1 activity were also investigated.Chronic administration of olanzapine significantly elevated fasting glucose and insulin levels, impaired glucose tolerance, but did not increase body weight. Total saturated fatty acids and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids were significantly increased and total monounsaturated fatty acids were significantly decreased, while total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids showed no prominent changes. Chronic olanzapine treatment significantly up-regulated D6 desaturase activity while down-regulating D5 desaturase activity. Palmitic  (C16:0), dihomo-γ- (C20:3n-6) and D6 desaturase were associated with an increase probability of insulin resistance, whereas nervonic  (C24:1) and SCD1 were significantly associated with a lower insulin resistance probability.All results indicated that such drug-induced effects on fatty  profile in plasma were relevant for the metabolic adverse effects associated with olanzapine and possibly other antipsychotics.

Currently, little is known about the plasma lipid species associated with . In this study, we compared plasma lipid fatty  (FA) profiles as a function of BMI. Profiling phospholipid (PL) FAs and their respective oxylipids could predict which obese individuals are more likely to suffer from diseases associated with chronic inflammation or oxidative stress. We investigated the relationship between BMI and plasma PL (PPL) FA composition in 126 men using a quantitative gas chromatography analysis. BMI was inversely associated with both PPL nervonic and linoleic  (LA) but was positively associated with both dihomo-γ- and palmitoleic . Compared to lean individuals, obese participants were more likely to have ω-6 FAs, except arachidonic  and LA, incorporated into PPLs. Obese participants were less likely to have EPA and DHA incorporated into PPLs compared to lean participants. Non-esterified plasma PUFA and oxylipid analysis showed ω-6 oxylipids were more abundant in the obese plasma pool. These ω-6 oxylipids are associated with increased angiogenesis (i.e. epoxyeicosatrienoates), reactive oxygen species (i.e. 9-hydroxyeicosatetraenoate), and inflammation resolution (i.e. Lipoxin A4). In summary, BMI is directly associated with specific PPL FA and increased ω-6 oxylipids.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the effect of perilla oil on -induced hepatic and vascular changes in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and provided underlying mechanisms for potential therapeutic applications. Tomato and paprika extract was added to prevent the oxidation during storage of perilla oil. HFD-fed mice were orally administered palm or perilla oil for 90 days. Food intake, body and liver weight, and serum cholesterol levels were measured. Arterial and hepatic lipid accumulation was determined by histological staining. Hepatic triglyceride levels and the expression of proteins regulating lipid metabolism were analyzed. Food intake and body weight were not different between palm oil-treated and perilla oil-treated mice. Serum cholesterol level was significantly lower in perilla oil-treated mice compared with palm oil-treated mice. HFD-induced lipid accumulation was also lower in thoracic aorta and liver by perilla oil compared with palm oil. Perilla oil also decreased hepatic triglyceride level without changing the liver weight. Perilla oil treatment increased the AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation and the lipolytic protein levels, whereas it decreased the lipogenic protein levels in the liver. In conclusion, perilla oil reduced serum cholesterol and arterial and hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD-fed mice. The data suggest that perilla oil improves the balance of lipogenic and lipolytic protein expression, and ameliorates -induced metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26912493>Maternal plasma PUFA concentrations during pregnancy and childhood adiposity: the Generation R Study.</a></h2><p>Maternal polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) concentrations during pregnancy may have persistent effects on growth and adiposity in the offspring. A suboptimal maternal diet during pregnancy might lead to fetal cardiometabolic adaptations with persistent consequences in the offspring.We examined the associations of maternal PUFA concentrations during pregnancy with childhood general and abdominal fat-distribution measures.In a population-based, prospective cohort study of 4830 mothers and their children, we measured maternal second-trimester plasma n-3 (ω-3) and n-6 (ω-6) PUFA concentrations. At the median age of 6.0 y (95% range: 5.6, 7.9 y), we measured childhood body mass index (BMI), the fat mass percentage, and the android:gynoid fat ratio with the use of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and measured the preperitoneal abdominal fat area with the use of ultrasound. Analyses were adjusted for maternal and childhood sociodemographic- and lifestyle-related characteristics.We observed that higher maternal total n-3 PUFA concentrations, and specifically those of eicosapentaenoic , docosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic , were associated with a lower childhood total-body fat percentage and a lower android:gynoid fat mass ratio (P< 0.05) but not with childhood BMI and the abdominal preperitoneal fat mass area. Higher maternal total n-6 PUFA concentrations, and specifically those of dihomo-γ-, were associated with a higher childhood total-body fat percentage, android:gynoid fat mass ratio, and abdominal preperitoneal fat mass area (P< 0.05) but not with childhood BMI. In line with these findings, a higher maternal n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio was associated with higher childhood total-body and abdominal fat mass.Lower maternal n-3 PUFA concentrations and higher n-6 PUFA concentrations during pregnancy are associated with higher body fat and abdominal fat in childhood.

The treatment oils (60 g/12 552 kJ per d (60 g/3000 kcal per d)) provided for 30 d were as follows: conventional canola oil, high oleic canola oil, high oleic canola oil enriched with DHA, flax/safflower oil blend and corn/safflower oil blend. Two SNP associated with FAE degradation and synthesis were studied. Post-treatment results showed overall that plasma FAE levels were modulated by dietary FA and were positively correlated with corresponding plasma FA levels; minor allele (A) carriers of SNP rs324420 in gene fatty  amide hydrolase produced higher circulating oleoylethanolamide (OEA) (P=0·0209) and docosahexaenoylethanolamide (DHEA) levels (P=0·0002). In addition, elevated plasma DHEA levels in response to DHA intake tended to be associated with lower plasma OEA levels and an increased gynoid fat mass.

Also, fatty  desaturation may be altered in abdominal . We aimed to investigate cross-sectional associations of serum fatty acids and desaturases with abdominal  prevalence in a population-based cohort study.

Similar models were employed to investigate relations between desaturase activities (estimated by fatty  ratios) and abdominal . In logistic regression analyses, palmitic , stearoyl-CoA-desaturase and Δ6-desaturase indices were associated with abdominal ; multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for highest versus lowest quartiles were 1.45 (1.19-1.76), 4.06 (3.27-5.05), and 3.07 (2.51-3.75), respectively.

A total of 71 participants developed new type 2 diabetes during follow-up.After adjusting for confounding factors, total saturated fatty acids, palmitoleic  (16:1n-7), dihomo-γ- (20:3n-6) and estimated stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 and Δ(6)-desaturase (D6D) enzyme activities significantly predicted the worsening of glycaemia whereas total polyunsaturated fatty , linoleic  (18:2n-6) and elongase activity predicted a decrease in the glucose AUC. Estimated D6D activity and dihomo-γ- (20:3n-6) were associated with an increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes. Results were consistent across the three different lipid fractions. However, fatty  proportions in the PL and CE fractions were stronger predictors for glycaemia and incident type 2 diabetes compared with fatty  proportions in the TG fraction.Selected fatty  proportions of plasma lipid fractions and their ratios, which reflect desaturase and elongase enzyme activities, may be good biomarkers for the worsening of glycaemia and incident type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30459098>Reduced intestinal FADS1 gene expression and plasma omega-3 fatty acids following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.</a></h2><p>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) limits food ingestion and may alter the intestinal expression of genes involved in the endogenous synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). These changes may decrease the systemic availability of bioactive PUFAs after RYGB. To study the impact of RYGB on the dietary ingestion and plasma concentration of PUFAs and on the intestinal expression of genes involved in their endogenous biosynthesis in severely obese women with type 2 diabetes.Before, and 3 and 12 months after RYGB, obese women (n = 20) self-reported a seven-day dietary record, answered a food frequency query and provided plasma samples for  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosahexaenoic (DHA) and arachidonic (ARA)  assessment by gas chromatography. Intestinal biopsies (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) were collected through double-balloon endoscopy before and 3 months after RYGB for gene expression analysis by microarray (Human GeneChip 1.0 ST array) and RT-qPCR validation.Compared to the preoperative period, patients had decreased intakes of PUFAs, fish and soybean oil (p < 0.05) and lower plasma concentrations of ALA and EPA (p < 0.001) 3 and 12 months after RYGB. FADS1 gene expression was lower in duodenum (RT-qPCR fold change = -1.620, p < 0.05) and jejunum (RT-qPCR fold change = -1.549, p < 0.05) 3 months following RYGB, compared to before surgery.RYGB decreased PUFA ingestion, plasma ALA and EPA levels, and intestinal expression of FADS1 gene. The latter encodes a key enzyme involved in endogenous biosynthesis of PUFAs. These data suggest that supplementation of omega-3 PUFAs may be required for obese patients undergoing RYGB.

The simple anthropometric measure of body mass index does not always reflect the biological effects of excessive body fat on health, thus additional molecular characterizations of obese phenotypes are needed to assess the risk of developing subsequent metabolic conditions at an individual level.To better understand the associations of free fatty acids (FFAs) with metabolic phenotypes of , we applied a targeted metabolomics approach to measure 40 serum FFAs from 452 individuals who participated in four independent studies, using an ultra-performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a Xevo G2 quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometer.FFA levels were significantly elevated in overweight/obese subjects with diabetes compared to their healthy counterparts. We identified a group of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) that are closely correlated with metabolic status in two groups of obese individuals who underwent weight loss intervention and can predict the recurrence of diabetes at two years after metabolic surgery. Two UFAs, dihomo-gamma- and palmitoleic , were also able to predict the future development of metabolic syndrome (MS) in a group of obese subjects.These findings underscore the potential role of UFAs in the MS pathogenesis and also as important markers in predicting the risk of developing diabetes in obese individuals or diabetes remission after a metabolic surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29456586>Dietary canolol protects the heart against the deleterious effects induced by the association of rapeseed oil, vitamin E and coenzyme Q10 in the context of a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p> progressively leads to cardiac failure. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been shown to have cardio-protective effects in numerous pathological situations. It is not known whether rapeseed oil, which contains α- (ALA), has a similar protective effect. Omega-3 PUFAs are sensitive to attack by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and lipid peroxidation products could damage cardiac cells. We thus tested whether dietary refined rapeseed oil (RSO) associated with or without different antioxidants (vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and canolol) is cardio-protective in a situation of abdominal .Sixty male Wistar rats were subdivided into 5 groups. Each group was fed a specific diet for 11 weeks: a low-fat diet (3% of lipids, C diet) with compositionally-balanced PUFAs; a high-fat diet rich in palm oil (30% of lipids, PS diet); the PS diet in which 40% of lipids were replaced by RSO (R diet); the R diet supplemented with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and vitamin E (RTC diet); and the RTC diet supplemented with canolol (RTCC diet). At the end of the diet period, the rats were sacrificed and the heart was collected and immediately frozen. Fatty  composition of cardiac phospholipids was then determined. Several features of cardiac function (fibrosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis) were also estimated.Abdominal  reduced cardiac oxidative stress and apoptosis rate by increasing the proportion of arachidonic  (AA) in membrane phospholipids. Dietary RSO had the same effect, though it normalized the proportion of AA. Adding vitamin E and CoQ10 in the RSO-rich high fat diet had a deleterious effect, increasing fibrosis by increasing angiotensin-2 receptor-1b (Ag2R-1b) mRNA expression. Overexpression of these receptors triggers coronary vasoconstriction, which probably induced ischemia. Canolol supplementation counteracted this deleterious effect by reducing coronary vasoconstriction.Canolol was found to counteract the fibrotic effects of vitamin E + CoQ10 on cardiac fibrosis in the context of a high-fat diet enriched with RSO. This effect occurred through a restoration of cardiac Ag2R-1b mRNA expression and decreased ischemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29859764>A 90-day repeated-dose toxicity study of dietary -enriched diacylglycerol oil in rats.</a></h2><p>Diets supplemented with  (ALA)-enriched diacylglycerol (DAG) oil-which mainly consists of oleic and , linoleic acids-have potential health benefits in terms of preventing or managing . Although safety of DAG oil has been extensively investigated, toxicity of ALA-DAG oil has not been well understood. Hence, the present study was conducted to clarify the potential adverse effects, if any, of ALA-DAG oil in rats (10/sex/group) fed diets containing 1.375%, 2.75%, or 5.5% ALA-DAG oil for 90 days. Compared to control rats fed rapeseed oil or ALA-triacylglycerol oil (flaxseed oil), rats receiving ALA-DAG oil did not reveal any toxicologically significant treatment-related changes as evaluated by clinical signs, functional observational battery, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, urinalysis, hematology, clinical chemistry, organ weight, necropsy and histopathology. The no observed adverse effect levels for dietary exposure to ALA-DAG oil for male and female rats were 2916 and 3326 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively, the highest dose tested.

Besides classic inflammatory markers, oxidized polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) metabolites (oxylipins) are potent mediators of inflammation. Little is known about endogenous levels of oxylipins, e.g. hydroxy, epoxy and dihydroxy FA in obese subjects with persistent low-grade inflammation. We aimed to evaluate levels of inflammatory markers and blood oxylipins in obese subjects before and after weight reduction.In the present study, 42 obese (BMI 32.7 ± 0.22 kg/m(2)) men and women were classified in groups according to high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels (no inflammation<1mg/L; low-grade inflammation ≥ 3 mg/L). Subjects underwent an intervention for eight weeks, which consisted of two phases: (1) week 1 and 2: total replacement of three meals by a formula diet and (2) six week partial formula diet (replacement of 1-2 meals). Blood samples were taken prior and post intervention for analysis of plasma protein levels of hsCRP, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Plasma Levels of free (unesterified) hydroxy, epoxy, and dihydroxy FAs as well as several prostanoids were analyzed in plasma by means of LC-MS-based targeted metabolomics.At baseline subjects with low-grade inflammation (hsCRP 8.95 ± 1.39 mg/L) showed significant higher levels of IL-6 (22.7 ± 1.15 ng/L) and TNF-α (17.4 ± 0.75 ng/L) compared to subjects with no inflammation (hsCRP: 0.69 ± 0.05 mg/L; IL-6: 15.9 ± 1.18 ng/L; TNF-α: 14.6 ± 0.80 ng/L). In both group's body weight was significantly reduced (p<0.001) after intervention (no inflammation group: -7.19 ± 0.86 kg, -7.3 ± 0.89%, p<0.001; low-grade inflammation group: -6.78 ± 0.87 kg, -6.7 ± 0.81%, p<0.001). Moreover, we observed significant decreases in levels of hsCRP (4.66 ± 0.64 mg/L; p=0.006), IL-6 (6.81 ± 1.15 ng/L; p<0.001) and TNF-α (6.09 ± 0.47 ng/L; p<0.001) in subjects with low-grade inflammation. Of 60 quantified oxylipins, 11 linoleic  (LA)-, 1 dihomo-γ- (DGLA)-, 7  (ALA)-, 15 arachidonic  (AA)-, 8 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)- and 18 docosahexaenoic  (DHA)-metabolites could be detected in plasma. For most oxylipins no differences were found between the low and high hsCRP groups before and after weight reduction. Interestingly, in subjects with low- grade inflammation several AA-derived oxylipins (5-, 8-, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETE)) were significantly higher compared to subjects with no inflammation before weight reduction and significantly reduced after weight reduction.Even moderate weight loss in obese subjects correlates to a significant improvement in the inflammatory state, by reducing hsCRP, IL-6, TNF-α and few oxylipins. The biological consequences of these changes remain to be further investigated.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined 34 individual fatty acids, measured in blood erythrocytes collected between 1996 and 1999, and breast cancer risk in a nested case-control study of primarily premenopausal women in the Nurses' Health Study II. Breast cancer cases diagnosed after blood collection and before June 2010 (n = 794) were matched to controls and conditional logistic regression was used to estimate OR's (95% CI's) for associations of fatty acids with breast cancer; unconditional logistic regression was used for stratified analyses. Fatty acids were not significantly associated with breast cancer risk overall; however, heterogeneity by body mass index (BMI) was observed. Among overweight/obese women (BMI ≥ 25), several odd-chain saturated (SFA, e.g. 17:0, OR (95% CI) =1.85 (1.18-2.88), p =0.006 p <0.001), trans (TFA, e.g. 18:1, OR (95% CI) =2.33 (1.45-3.77), p <0.001, p =0.007) and dairy-derived fatty acids (SFA 15:0 + 17:0 + TFA 16:1n-7t; OR (95% CI) =1.83(1.16-2.89), p =0.005, p <0.001) were positively associated, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA, e.g. ; OR (95% CI) =0.57 (0.36-0.89), p =0.017, p =0.03) were inversely associated with breast cancer. Total SFA were inversely associated with breast cancer among women with BMI < 25 (OR (95% CI) =0.68 (0.46-0.98), p =0.05, p =0.01). Thus, while specific fatty acids were not associated with breast cancer overall, our findings suggest positive associations of several SFA, TFA and dairy-derived fatty acids and inverse associations of n-3 PUFA with breast cancer among overweight/obese women. Given these fatty acids are influenced by diet, and therefore are potentially modifiable, further investigation of these associations among overweight/obese women is warranted.© 2017 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25373924>Involvement of dietary Fatty acids in multiple biological and psychological functions, in morbidly obese subjects.</a></h2><p>Fatty  (FA) profile is often altered, in morbidly obese subjects, both before and after bariatric surgery. We measured FA plasma levels before and 6 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), in order to evaluate their relationship with different biological and psychological parameters and the impact of RYGB on the FA plasma levels.Thirty eight morbidly obese patients were investigated before RYGB, and 28 of them were reexamined 6 months postoperatively. Anxiety, depression, and quality of life were evaluated by validated questionnaires. Plasma FA (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated ω-6 and ω-3), vitamins A and E, fasting insulinemia, and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured.Before surgery, ω-3 polyunsaturated FA and vit A showed significant negative relationship with fasting insulinemia (γ- p = 0.03, eicosapentaenoic, vit A p = 0.01) and hs-CRP (eicosapentaenoic p = 0.03, vit A p = 0.02) and a positive link with HDL cholesterol (γ- p = 0.03, vit A p = 0.02). Depression score was significantly and negatively linked with palmitoleic (p = 0.03), γ- (p = 0.006), dihomo-γ- (p = 0.02), and α- (p = 0.03) acids. After surgery, FA and both vit A and E were significantly reduced. Vit A levels were below 2.4 μmol/l in 63 % of the patients, preoperatively, and in 79 % after surgery. Preoperative levels of linoleic  were significantly related with the postoperative weight reduction (p = 0.0006).FA are involved in several biological and psychological functions. The RYGB-induced reduction of FA could have deleterious consequences on vitamin absorption, metabolism, and depression.

We investigated both the independent and combined effects of exercise training and ALA consumption in obese Zucker rats, aiming to determine the potential for additive improvements in cardiovascular function. ALA and exercise training independently improved cardiac output, end-diastolic volume, left ventricular fibrosis and mean blood pressure following a 4 week intervention. Combining ALA and endurance exercise yielded greater improvements in these parameters, independent of changes in markers of oxidative stress or endogenous anti-oxidants. We postulate that divergent mechanisms of action may explain these changes: ALA increases peripheral vasodilation, and exercise training stimulates angiogenesis.Although α- (ALA) and endurance exercise training independently attenuate hyperlipidaemia-related cardiovascular derangements, there is a paucity of information pertaining to their mechanisms of action and efficacy when combined as a preventative therapeutic approach. Therefore, we used obese Zucker rats to investigate the independent and combined effects of these interventions on cardiovascular disease. Specifically, animals were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: control diet-sedentary, ALA supplemented-sedentary, control diet-exercise trained or ALA supplemented-exercise trained. Following a 4 week intervention, although the independent and combined effects of ALA and exercise reduced (P < 0.05) the serum free/esterified cholesterol ratio, only the ALA supplemented-exercise trained animals displayed a reduction in the content of both serum free and esterified cholesterol. Moreover, although ALA and endurance training individually increased cardiac output, stroke volume and end-diastolic volume, as well as reduced left ventricle fibrosis, mean blood pressure and total peripheral resistance, these responses were all greater following the combined intervention (ALA supplemented-exercise trained). These effects occurred independent of changes in oxidative phosphorylation proteins, markers of oxidative stress or endogenous anti-oxidant capacity. We propose that the beneficial effects of a combined intervention occur as a result of divergent mechanisms of action elicited by ALA and endurance exercise because only exercise training increased the capillary content in the left ventricle and skeletal muscle, and tended to decrease protein carbonylation in the left ventricle (P = 0.06). Taken together, our data indicate that combining ALA and endurance exercise provides additional improvements in cardiovascular disease risk reduction compared to singular interventions in the obese Zucker rat.© 2017 The Authors.

Regulation of lipid metabolism is crucial in the improvement of type 2 diabetes and  associated symptoms. The role of CaMKII in membrane associated lipid metabolism was the focus of this study. Five to six weeks old male Wistar rats were used in this study. GC×GC-TOFMS technique was used to determine the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic , arachidonic  and 11,14-eicosadienoic ). Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (Cpt-1) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc-1) genes expression were assessed using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). From the results, CaMKII activation by exercise increased the levels of arachidonic  and 11,14-eicosadienoic  while a decrease in the level of  was observed in the skeletal muscle. The results indicated that exercise-induced CaMKII activation increased CPT-1 expression and decreased ACC-1 expression in rat skeletal muscle. All the observed increases with activation of CaMKII by exercise were aborted when KN93, an inhibitor of CaMKII was injected in exercising rats. This study demonstrated that CaMKII activation by exercise regulated lipid metabolism.

Nowadays, in the adult population of Europe it is estimated at 14% to 21%. Its most important risk factors are  and metabolic syndrome. Introducing lifestyle changes such as: dietary intervention and increased physical activity are the first-line treatment and are intended to support not only NAFLD but also associated diseases such as , insulin resistance, diabetes and dyslipidemia. Dietary management focuses on weight reduction of overweight or obese people by decreasing energy in diet. It is recommended to limit the intake of saturated fats and trans fatty acids as well as cholesterol. Instead, it is important to increase the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty  diets, mainly from the n-3 family, which exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. It is also beneficial to eat nuts, despite their high energy value, as a source of , which lowers LDL cholesterol. It is important to increase the share of vegetable protein (eg. soya) and limit the intake of fat meat, milk and the dairy products. A key role in the treatment and prevention of NAFLD is also a reduction of simple sugars and total exclusion of added sugar in the diet. The rise of NAFLD in developed countries is analogous to the increase of fructose consumption, which high intake is directly indicated as the main cause of the disease. Choosing foods with high fiber content, low glycemic index and meals composed with low glycemic load, is conducive to weight reduction. An important role in supporting NAFLD treatment is also attributed to vitamin D, C and E supplementation and some probiotic bacteria, as well as cinnamon and turmeric, which improve insulin sensitivity. Daily physical activity is strongly recommended as the supplement of healthy lifestyle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28851088>Diacylglycerol Enhances the Effects of  Against Visceral Fat: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect of -rich diacylglycerol (ALA-DAG) compared with -rich triacylglycerol (ALA-TAG) on visceral fat area (VFA) in people with overweight.Subjects with overweight were recruited to a randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group designed trial and randomly allocated to two groups that consumed either 2.5 g/d ALA-TAG or ALA-DAG for 12 weeks.

Clinically, the blocking stimulation of the endocannabinoid pathway has been one of the first approaches proposed to counteract the  and -associated diseases (such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cancer). In this connection, here we studied in cultured 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes the effects of n-3-PUFA, α- (OM-3), n-6-PUFA, Linoleic  (OM-6), and hydroxytyrosol (HT) on the expression of CB1 receptor gene and the adipogenesis-related genes PPAR-γ, Fatty  Synthase (FAS) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL). HT was able to inhibit 3T3-L1 cell differentiation by down-regulating cell proliferation and CB1 receptor gene expression. HT exhibited anti-adipogenic effects, whereas OM-3 and OM-6 exerted an inhibitory action on cell proliferation associated with an induction of the preadipocytes differentiation and CB1 receptor gene expression. Moreover, the expression of FAS and LPL genes resulted increased after treatment with both HT and OM-3 and OM-6. The present study points out that the intake of molecules such as HT, contained in extra virgin olive oil, may be considered also in view of antiobesity and antineoplastic properties by acting directly on the adipose tissue and modulating CB1 receptor gene transcription.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27165261>Dietary Black Raspberry Seed Oil Ameliorates Inflammatory Activities in db/db Mice.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the status of the markers related to inflammation in db/db mice fed black raspberry seed (BRS) oil, which is rich in α-.

However, few studies have focused on validation of semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (SFFQ) for determining the n-3 and n-6 intakes in children. Therefore, a valid SFFQ for assessing n-3 and n-6 intakes among Indonesian children is required.A cross-sectional study was conducted by selecting 89 healthy children through multistage random sampling. Dietary intakes were assessed using the SFFQ and a 3-day non-consecutive 24-h recall. Randomly selected children (n=35) were assessed for plasma phospholipid fatty  (PFA). In total, 78 food items in the SFFQ, as in the Thai, Vietnamese, and American food composition databases, were validated using dietary recall and PFA. The SFFQ was readministered after 4 weeks to assess its reproducibility. The validity and reproducibility of the SFFQ were determined by Bland-Altman analysis.Favourable agreement was found between the SFFQ and recall for docosahexanoic , eicosapentanoic , docosapentanoic , and arachidonic , but not for total n-3, n-6, α-, or linoleic . Significant correlations were found between the SFFQ estimations and plasma n-6 and LA (r=0.40, p=0.025; and r=0.42, p=0.018, respectively). A 95% limit of Bland-Altman agreement was observed between the first and repeat SFFQ for all fatty acids.The proposed SFFQ is sufficiently valid and reliable for assessment of essential fatty acids intakes in Indonesian children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25828602>Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  status in : a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  (LCPUFA) status has recently been related to the pathogenesis of .

One fenugreek TG was purified using a bioassay-guided fractionation and administrated to surviving diabetic rats. The free fatty acids percentage as well as, the peroxide, the saponification and the iodine values were 2%, 12 mequiv. O/kg of oil, 189 (mg KOH/g) and 110 (g/100 g of oil), respectively.  (C 26.14%), Linoleic  (C 41.13%) and Oleic  (C 17.07%) were the dominant fatty acids in the FSO. β-sitosterol was the major sterol (85.3%) in the FSO. LnLnO (17.1%), LLL (16.6%), OLL and OOLn (8.4%), were the abundant triglycerides. The hexane extract of fenugreek seed (exhibiting the powerful inhibitory activity against alpha-amylase) was purified using a bioassay-guided fractionation affording one fenugreek TG: (11Z)-11- eicosenoic  2, 3- bis[((9Z, 12Z, 15Z)-1-oxo-9, 12, 15-octadecatrien-1-yl)oxy] propyl ester. In diabetic rats, the administration of the fenugreek TG inhibited α-amylase activity in small intestine by 36% as compared to untreated diabetic rats. Moreover, fenugreek TG increased insulin sensibility which leads to decrease in blood glucose level by 43%. In addition, this study demonstrated that administration of pure fenugreek TG to diabetic rats ameliorated the glycogen rate in liver and muscle. In addition, the administration of fenugreek TG reverted back the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme respectively in kidney and plasma by 33 and 29%. Interestingly, the fenugreek TG inhibited lipase activity in small intestine by 33% which leads to the regulation of lipid profile. Moreover, the fenugreek TG protected liver-kidney function evidenced by histological study. In conclusion, our finding demonstrates that the administration of fenugreek TG to diabetic rats can make it a potential candidate for industrial application as a pharmacological agent for the treatment of hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27973445>Roles of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α in Bitter Melon Seed Oil-Corrected Lipid Disorders and Conversion of α-Eleostearic  into Rumenic  in C57BL/6J Mice.</a></h2><p>We previously reported that bitter melon seed oil (BMSO) was an effective anti-steatosis and antiobesity agent. Since the major fatty  α-eleostearic  (α-ESA) in BMSO is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activator, the objective was to investigate the role of PPARα in BMSO-modulated lipid disorders and α-ESA metabolism. C57BL/6J wild (WD) and PPARα knockout (KO) mice were fed a high-fat diet containing BMSO (15% soybean oil + 15% BMSO, HB) or not (30% soybean oil, HS) for 5 weeks. The HB diet significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride concentrations and increased acyl-CoA oxidase activity in WD, but not in KO mice. However, regardless of genotype, body fat percentage was lowered along with upregulated protein levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and tyrosine hydroxylase, as well as signaling pathway of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and AMP-activated protein kinase in the white adipose tissue of HB-treated groups compared to HS cohorts. In WD-HB and KO-HB groups, white adipose tissue had autophagy, apoptosis, inflammation, and browning characteristics. Without PPARα, in vivo reduction of α-ESA into rumenic  was slightly but significantly lowered, along with remarkable reduction of hepatic retinol saturase () expression. We concluded that BMSO-mediated anti-steatosis depended on PPARα, whereas the anti-adiposity effect was PPARα-independent. In addition, PPARα-dependent enzymes may participate in α-ESA conversion, but only have a minor role.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26968402>Sources and Bioactive Properties of Conjugated Dietary Fatty Acids.</a></h2><p>The group of conjugated fatty acids known as conjugated linoleic  (CLA) isomers have been extensively studied with regard to their bioactive potential in treating some of the most prominent human health malignancies. However, CLA isomers are not the only group of potentially bioactive conjugated fatty acids currently undergoing study. In this regard, isomers of conjugated α-, conjugated nonadecadienoic  and conjugated eicosapentaenoic , to name but a few, have undergone experimental assessment. These studies have indicated many of these conjugated fatty  isomers commonly possess anti-carcinogenic, anti-adipogenic, anti-inflammatory and immune modulating properties, a number of which will be discussed in this review. The mechanisms through which these bioactivities are mediated have not yet been fully elucidated. However, existing evidence indicates that these fatty acids may play a role in modulating the expression of several oncogenes, cell cycle regulators, and genes associated with energy metabolism. Despite such bioactive potential, interest in these conjugated fatty acids has remained low relative to the CLA isomers. This may be partly attributed to the relatively recent emergence of these fatty acids as bioactives, but also due to a lack of awareness regarding sources from which they can be produced. In this review, we will also highlight the common sources of these conjugated fatty acids, including plants, algae, microbes and chemosynthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29500968>Effects of a hypoenergetic diet rich in α- on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in overweight and obese patients with metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Plant-derived α- (ALA) may exert cardioprotective effects. Dietary ALA can undergo desaturation and elongation to form long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but the extent to which this occurs in humans is unclear. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of an energy-restricted diet enriched with ALA on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in patients with metabolic syndrome.The present analysis compared the effects of a hypoenergetic diet high in ALA (3.4 g/d) with a control diet low in ALA (0.9 g/d) on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in 81 overweight or obese patients with features of metabolic syndrome.After a 26-wk intervention, concentration of ALA in serum phospholipids remained constant in both diet groups. The control group had a significant decrease in serum phospholipid eicosapentaenoic  concentration, although no significant intergroup difference was observed. Serum phospholipid docosahexaenoic  concentration significantly decreased to a similar extent with both interventions. Additionally, both interventions significantly decreased serum phospholipid concentrations of palmitic , stearic , total saturated fatty acids, linoleic , total ω-6 and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, with no effect of diet group on these changes. Compared with the ALA diet, the control diet led to a significant increase in serum phospholipid oleic  concentration.Daily intake of 3.4 g of ALA during a 26-wk energy-restricted diet did not lead to an enrichment of serum phospholipids with ALA and did not increase eicosapentaenoic  due to conversion. Additionally, dietary ALA was unable to compensate for a decrease in serum phospholipid docosahexaenoic .Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Five-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed diets consisting of 50% calories from lard, 5% from soybean, and 5% from corn oil (HFD), or 50% calories from lard and 10% from BRS oil (HFD + BRS oil diet) for 12 weeks. Six-week-old C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were fed diets consisting of 16% calories from soybean oil (standard diet), 8% from soybean, and 8% from BRS oil, or 16% from BRS oil for 10 weeks. The BRS oil diets lowered the levels of triacylglycerol, nonesterified fatty acids, and total cholesterol in serum and liver of both of the obese and db/db mice as compared with the HFD and standard diet, respectively. mRNA levels of lipogenesis markers including cluster of differentiation 36, fatty--binding protein 1, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c, fatty- synthase, and solute carrier family 25 member 1 in the liver of the BRS oil groups were lower than those in the liver of the HFD and standard groups in the obese and db/db mice, respectively. On the other hand, fatty- oxidation markers including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, hydroxylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase α, and acyl-CoA oxidase in the liver of the BRS oil groups were higher than those in the liver of the HFD and standard groups in the obese and db/db mice, respectively. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α mRNA and protein levels increased in the liver and epididymal adipose tissue of the obese and db/db mice fed BRS oil compared with HFD and standard diet, respectively. BRS oil might improve lipid metabolism by inhibiting lipogenesis and promoting fatty- oxidation in HFD-induced obese and db/db mice.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30889655>Improved anti- effect of herbal active and endogenous lipids co-loaded lipid nanocarriers: Preparation, in vitro and in vivo evaluation.</a></h2><p>The association of numerous advantages of natural active compounds (from vegetal and herbs) and endogenous lipid in the same delivery system is a straightforward approach for the development of safe and better tolerated anti- therapy. In the present study we envisage a novel concept for  therapy, devoted to the development of innovative lipid nanostructured formulas with improved gastric tolerability and enhanced specificity in adipose cells targeting. For this purpose, an anti- herbal active from red pepper extract - Capsaicin (Cap) and an endogenous lipid regulator of appetite - oleoylethanolamide (OEA) or a structural analogue of OEA - Phenylalaninol oleamide (PAO), are simultaneously integrated within the same delivery system - nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) prepared with linseed oil that has anti-inflammatory and hypotriglyceridemic properties. The NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap presented mean diameters under 200 nm, size that allow an efficient uptake of actives by enterocytes and lead to an extended biological action of all actives - Cap, OEA/PAO and . NLC revealed a polidispersity index ranging from 0.16 to 0.22, which represents a narrow dispersion around mean size and suggests an adequate unimodal behavior. The two types of NLC co-loaded with Cap and OEA/PAO were both negatively charged, with zeta potentials of -42.8 mV and -58.5 mV that offered a guarantee for an excellent stability of NLC in time. Despite to the competition between the accommodations of both actives into the lipid core of nanocarriers, the entrapment efficiency exceeds 92% for OEA/PAO and is ranged between 71 and 82% for Cap. In the presence of NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap, ABTS inhibition proceeded in a Capsaicin concentration dependent manner and was dependent on the type of NLC formulation. A remarkable radical-scavenging activity against ABTS was determined for Cap and OEA based-NLC. The in vitro release demonstrated that NLC played an important role on the delay of Cap dissolution; the NLC have ensured a slow release of Cap, eg only 21% Cap was released after 24 h of in vitro experiments. The in vivo pharmacological evaluation has revealed that the NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap treatment resulted in a body weight decrease and improves the lipid and glucose profile, as compared to the obese mice batch.  mice treated with NLC-OEA exhibited a weight loss of ~15% and ~10% weight loss for NLC-POA, after 10-days treatment. Administration of NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap to the Albino Swiss mice led to significant decrease of glucose level (e.g. 117.4 mg/dL for NLC-OEA-Cap treated mice versus 213.9 mg/dL for obese mice batch) and exhibited a desired decrease effect of triglyceride (e.g. 71.1 mg/dL for NLC-OEA-Cap versus 129.5, for obese batch). Moreover, the cholesterol values have been lowered to almost half from the value determined for the control batches. Overall, study highlights that using appropriate lipid mediators in association with an herbal anti- active, both formulated into lipid nanocarriers, could enhance the therapeutic response in the  treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, very little is known about the effects of the number and the position of double bonds in LCFA with the same length on brown fat-specific gene expression. To determine the specificity of LCFA in the regulation of these genes in different adipocyte models, fully differentiated 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, murine, or porcine primary adipocytes (obtained from the subcutaneous fat pad of C57BL/6 mice or Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc crossbred piglets) were treated with 50 μM of the following 18-carbon fatty acids: stearic  (STA; 18:0), oleic  (OLA; 18:1, Δ9), linoleic  (LNA; 18:2, Δ9,12), α- (ALA; 18:3, Δ9,12,15), γ- (GLA; 18:3, Δ6,9,12), or pinolenic  (PLA; 18:3, Δ5,9,12) for 24 h with or without 4-h norepinephrine (NE) treatment. Expression levels of thermoregulatory markers were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. LNA, ALA, GLA, and PLA upregulated Ucp1 expression and tended to upregulate Pgc1a expression in murine primary adipocytes, but not in 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, and porcine primary adipocytes. In murine primary adipocytes, NE induced a higher expression of Ucp1 and Pgc1a than non-NE-treated cells, and PLA augmented the NE effect. In 10T1/2 cells, NE upregulated Ucp1 and Pgc1a expression, but there was no fatty  effect. However, 3T3-L1 cells were insensitive to both fatty  and beta-adrenergic agonist stimulation. These results indicate that different adipocyte cell types have different levels of sensitivity to both LCFA and beta agonists in regard to induction of brown fat-specific gene expression.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30622622>Maternal dietary ratio of linoleic  to  during pregnancy has sex-specific effects on placental and fetal weights in the rat.</a></h2><p>Increased consumption of linoleic  (LA, omega-6) in Western diets coupled with the pro-inflammatory and adipogenic properties of its derivatives has led to suggestions that fetal exposure to this dietary pattern could be contributing to the intergenerational cycle of .This study aimed to evaluate the effects of maternal consumption of a LA to  (ALA) ratio similar to modern Western diets (9:1) compared to a lower ratio (1:1.5) on placental and fetal growth, and to determine any cumulative effects by feeding both diets at two total fat levels (18% vs 36% fat w/w). Female Wistar rats ( = 5-7/group) were assigned to one of the four experimental diets prior to mating until 20d of gestation.Fatty  profiles of maternal and fetal blood and placental tissue at 20d gestation were different between dietary groups, and largely reflected dietary fatty  composition. Female fetuses were heavier (2.98 ± 0.06 g vs 3.36 ± 0.07 g,  < 0.01) and male placental weight was increased (0.51 ± 0.02 g vs 0.58 ± 0.02 g,  < 0.05) in the low LA:ALA groups.

The relation between dietary and circulating FA in cardiometabolic patients is largely unknown. We examined whether dietary n-3 FA and LA were reflected in plasma lipid pools in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients.Patients in Alpha Omega Cohort filled out a 203-item food-frequency questionnaire from which eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA),  (ALA), and LA intake were calculated. Circulating individual FA (% total FA) were assessed in cholesteryl esters (CE; n = 4066), phospholipids (PL; n = 838), and additionally in total plasma for DHA and LA (n = 739). Spearman correlation coefficients (r) were calculated for dietary vs. circulating FA. Circulating FA were also compared across dietary FA quintiles, overall and in subgroups by sex, , diabetes, statin use, and high alcohol intake. Patients were on average 69 years old and 79% was male. Moderate correlations between dietary and circulating levels were observed for EPA (r∼0.4 in CE and PL) and DHA (r ∼0.5 in CE and PL, ∼0.4 in total plasma), but not for ALA (r ∼0.0). Weak correlations were observed for LA (r 0.1 to 0.2). Plasma LA was significantly lower in statin users and in patients with a high alcohol intake.In post-MI patients, dietary EPA and DHA were well reflected in circulating levels.

This paper aims to study the content of fatty acids (FAs) and phenolic compounds of brown alga Laminaria ochroleuca (L. ochroleuca) and to determine the nutritional quality of the lipids extracted using pressurized liquids extraction (PLE) technique. PLE was applied to the algae using four solvents of different polarity (hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol and ethanol:water 1:1). Results showed that the higher yield (52%), is obtained with ethanol: water solvent, however, both ethyl acetate and ethanol enrich unsaturated fatty  (USFA) (palmitoleic, , linoleic, oleic, araquidonic and eicosapenataenoic) in the lipid fraction of L. ochroleuca, providing extracts up to 55% of their total fatty  content compared to other solvents. The nutritional quality of the lipids in all PLE extracts was assessed by considering the ω-6/ ω-3 fatty  ratio and two dietary indexes involved in the risks of coronary heart disease, atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenic (TI).

To test the hypothesis that an n-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty -rich food could synergize with other, largely polyphenol-rich foods by producing greater reductions in metabolic disease conditions, the intake of English walnuts was evaluated in combination with 9 other whole foods.Eight-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice were fed low-fat (LF; 10% fat) and HF control diets, along with an HF diet with 8.6% (wt:wt) added walnuts for 9 wk. The HF control diet contained 46% fat with added sucrose (10.9%, wt:wt) and cholesterol (1%, wt:wt); the added sucrose and cholesterol were not present in the LF diet. Other groups were provided the walnut diet with a second whole food-raspberries, apples, cranberries, tart cherries, broccoli sprouts, olive oil, soy protein, or green tea. All of the energy-containing whole foods were added at an energy level equivalent to 1.5 servings/d. Body weights, food intake, and glucose tolerance were determined. Postmortem, serum lipids and inflammatory markers, hepatic fat, gene expression, and the relative concentrations of 594 biochemicals were measured.The addition of walnuts with either raspberries, apples, or green tea reduced glucose area under the curve compared with the HF diet alone (-93%, -64%, and -54%, respectively, P < 0.05). Compared with HF-fed mice, mice fed walnuts with either broccoli sprouts or green tea (-49% and -61%, respectively, P < 0.05) had reduced hepatic fat concentrations. There were differences in global gene expression patterns related to whole-food content, with many examples of differences in LF- and HF-fed mice, HF- and walnut-fed mice, and mice fed walnuts and walnuts plus other foods. The mean ± SEM increase in relative hepatic concentrations of the n-3 fatty acids α-, eicosapentanoic , and docosapentanoic  in all walnut-fed groups was 124% ± 13%, 159% ± 11%, and 114% ± 10%, respectively (P < 0.0001), compared with LF- and HF-fed mice not consuming walnuts.In obese male mice, walnut consumption with an HF Western-style diet caused changes in hepatic fat concentrations, gene expression patterns, and fatty  concentrations. The addition of a second whole food in combination with walnuts produced other changes in metabolite concentrations and gene expression patterns and other physiologic markers.

We measured fetal growth by ultrasound (n=924), neonatal body composition (air displacement plethysmography (n=252 at birth, and n=317 at age 10 days), and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (n=317)), postnatal growth (n=979) and skinfold thicknesses (n=981). Results were presented as regression coefficients for a 5% increase in PUFA levels.LA levels were positively associated with birthweight (β (95% CI): 0.04 (0.01, 0.08) kg), body mass index (0.13 (0.02, 0.25) kg/m), head circumference (0.11 (0.03, 0.19) cm), and neonatal abdominal adipose tissue volume (4.6 (1.3, 7.8) mL for superficial subcutanous tissue, and 1.2 (0.1, 2.4) mL for internal tissue), but not with later outcomes. DHA levels, although not associated with birth outcomes, were related to higher postnatal length/height: 0.63 (0.09, 1.16) cm at 12 months and 1.29 (0.34, 2.24) cm at 5 years.LA was positively associated with neonatal body size, and DHA with child height.

Therefore, we investigated the independent and combined effects of α- (ALA) supplementation and exercise training on whole-body glucose homeostasis and mitochondrial bioenergetics within the WAT and skeletal muscle of obese Zucker rats.We randomly assigned obese Zucker rats to receive a control diet alone or supplemented with ALA and to remain sedentary or undergo exercise training for 4 weeks (CON-Sed, ALA-Sed, CON-Ex and ALA-Ex groups). Whole-body glucose tolerance was determined in response to a glucose load. Mitochondrial content and bioenergetics were examined in skeletal muscle and epididymal WAT (eWAT). Insulin sensitivity and cellular stress were assessed by western blot.Exercise training independently improved whole-body glucose tolerance as well as insulin-induced signalling in muscle and WAT. However, the consumption of ALA during exercise training prevented exercise-mediated improvements in whole-body glucose tolerance. ALA consumption did not influence exercise-induced adaptations within skeletal muscle, insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial bioenergetics. In contrast, within eWAT, ALA supplementation attenuated insulin signalling, decreased mitochondrial respiration and increased the fraction of electron leak to reactive oxygen species (ROS).These findings indicate that, in an obese rodent model, consumption of ALA attenuates the favourable adaptive changes of exercise training within eWAT, which consequently impacts whole-body glucose homeostasis.

Visceral adiposity is part of the metabolic syndrome, together with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension and inflammation. Alleviation of metabolic syndrome requires normalization of insulin release and responses. This review assesses our current knowledge of the mechanisms that allow n-3 PUFAs to improve insulin secretion and sensitivity. EPA has been more extensively studied than either ALA or DHA. The complex actions of EPA include increased G-protein-receptor-mediated release of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) from enteroendocrine L-cells in the intestine, up-regulation of the apelin pathway and down-regulation of other control pathways to promote insulin secretion by the pancreatic β-cells, together with suppression of inflammatory responses to adipokines, inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α actions and prevention of decreased insulin-like growth factor-1 secretion to improve peripheral insulin responses. The receptors involved and the mechanisms of action probably differ for ALA and DHA, with antiobesity effects predominating for ALA and anti-inflammatory effects for DHA. Modifying both GLP-1 release and the actions of adipokines by n-3 PUFAs could lead to additive improvements in both insulin secretion and sensitivity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This is important to study considering reports that link altered desaturase activity with adipose tissue PUFA profiles, body weight, and whole-body glucose homeostasis. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the direct effects of PUFAs on FADS expression in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with either α- (ALA), linoleic (LA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), or arachidonic  (AA). Gene expression, protein abundance, and cellular PUFA content were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, and gas chromatography, respectively.Fads1 and Fads2 gene expression was reduced by EPA and AA, but not ALA or LA. Reductions in gene expression were reflected in FADS2 protein levels, but not FADS1. Treating cells with ALA and LA led to significant increases in the cellular content of downstream PUFAs. Neither ALA nor EPA changed docosahexaenoic  content.Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes have a functional FADS pathway that can be regulated by PUFA.

Endotoxins are now well recognized as an important factor implicated in the onset and maintain of this inflammatory state during fat digestion in high-fat diet. As a preventive strategy, lipid formulation could be optimized to limit these phenomena, notably regarding fatty  profile and PL emulsifier content. Little is known about soybean polar lipid (SPL) consumption associated to oils rich in saturated FA vs. anti-inflammatory omega-3 FA such as α- on inflammation and metabolic endotoxemia. We then investigated in mice the effect of different synthetic diets enriched with two different oils, palm oil or flaxseed oil and containing or devoid of SPL on adipose tissue inflammation and endotoxin receptors. In both groups containing SPL, adipose tissue (WAT) increased compared with groups devoid of SPL and an induction of MCP-1 and LBP was observed in WAT. However, only the high-fat diet in which flaxseed oil was associated with SPL resulted in both higher WAT inflammation and higher circulating sCD14 in plasma. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that LPS transporters LBP and sCD14 and adipose tissue inflammation can be modulated by SPL in high fat diets differing in oil composition. Notably high-flaxseed oil diet exerts a beneficial metabolic impact, however blunted by PL addition. Our study suggests that nutritional strategies can be envisaged by optimizing dietary lipid sources in manufactured products, including fats/oils and polar lipid emulsifiers, in order to limit the inflammatory impact of palatable foods.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Among them conjugated fatty acids are of great interest. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA), which exert a multidirectional health-benefiting influence, and conjugated  acids (CLnA, super CLA) are examples of this group of fatty acids. CLnA are a group of positional and geometric isomers of octadecatrienoic  (C18:3), which possess double bonds at positions 9, 11, 13 or 8, 10, 12 of their chain. Some vegetable oils are rich sources of CLnA, e.g. bitter melon oil (from Momordica charantia seeds) and pomegranate oil (from Punica granatum seeds). The aim of this paper was to present information concerning natural sources and health-promoting activities of conjugated  acids. The presented data reveal that conjugated  acids may be very useful in prevention and treatment of many diseases, especially diabetes, arteriosclerosis ,  and cancers (mammary, prostate and colon cancer). Among many potential mechanisms of their action, the fact that some CLnA are converted by oxidoreductases into CLA is very important.

Serum concentrations of N-3 ( (ALA), eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic ) and N-6 PUFAs (linoleic , gamma-, dihomo-gamma-, arachidonic ) were determined as percentage total fatty acids. Children's anthropometry was measured annually for a median of 30 months. We used mixed-effects models with restricted cubic splines to construct population body mass index-for-age z-score (BAZ) growth curves for age- and sex-specific quartiles of each PUFA.N-3 ALA was inversely related to BAZ gain after adjustment for sex, baseline age and weight status, as well as household socioeconomic level. Estimated BAZ change between 6 and 14 years among children in the highest quartile of ALA compared with those in the lowest quartile was 0.45 (95% confidence interval: 0.07, 0.83) lower (P-trend=0.006).N-3 ALA may be protective against weight gain in school-age children.

There are scant data regarding how the content of non-essential fatty acids like monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) impact the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In this work, we tested the hypothesis that obesogenic diets enriched in oleic  (OA; 18:1n-9) reduce polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) levels vs an obesogenic diet enriched in SFAs. Adult male mice were fed for eight weeks either (1) a control 16% fat energy (en) diet with 5.7% en OA and 4.4% en SFA, (2) a 50% fat en diet with 33% en OA and 9.9% en SFA, or (3) a 50% en diet with a high SFA diet with 33% en SFA and 9.1% en OA. Dietary levels and intake of linoleic  (LA; 18:2n-6) and α- (ALA; 18:3n-3) were constant between the experimental groups. Several peripheral organs (liver, heart, kidney, and adipose) were analyzed for lipid composition and oxylipin analysis was performed for liver and adipose. Our data demonstrate that a high OA diet reduced tissue content of LA and ALA (≥30%) in phospholipid and neutral lipid fractions, reduced the content of some LA-derived and ALA-derived oxylipins in liver and adipose, and conversely, elevated hepatic content of PGF. In all tissues examined, except for adipose, levels of arachidonic  (ARA; 20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) were either elevated or unaffected by the obesogenic diets.

However, because insulin concentrations were associated only with BCSs, further examination of the role of adiponectin in canine  is warranted.

The plant form of Omega-3 FAs is the short-chain α-, and the marine forms are the long-chain fatty acids: docosahexaenoic  and eicosapentaenoic . Omega-3 FAs have unlimited usages, and they are considered as omnipotent since they may benefit heart health, improve brain function, reduce cancer risks and improve people's moods. Omega-3 FAs also have several important biological effects on a range of cellular functions that may decrease the onset of heart diseases and reduce mortality among patients with coronary heart disease, possibly by stabilizing the heart's rhythm and by reducing blood clotting. Some review studies have described the beneficial roles of Omega-3 FAs in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancer, diabetes, and other conditions, including inflammation. Studies of the effect of Omega-3 FAs gathered from studies in diseased and healthy population. CVDs including atherosclerosis, coronary heart diseases, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome were the major fields of investigation. In studies of , as the central  increased, the level of adipocyte synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were increased and the level of anti-inflammatory adiponectin was decreased indicating a state of inflammation. The level of C reactive protein (CRP) synthesized from hepatocyte is increased by the influence of IL-6. CRP can be considered as a marker of systemic inflammation associated with increased risks of CVDs. In molecular studies, Omega-3 FAs have direct effects on reducing the inflammatory state by reducing IL-6, TNF-α, CRP and many other factors.

In the current study, obese Zucker rats displayed decreased phospholipid (PL) content in association with hepatic lipid abundance, and therefore, we examined whether ALA and exercise training would prevent these abnormalities differently to reveal additive effects on the liver. To achieve this aim, obese Zucker rats were fed control diet alone or supplemented with ALA and were sedentary or exercise trained for 4 wk (C-Sed, ALA-Sed, C-Ex, and ALA-Ex). ALA-Sed rats had increased microsomal-triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP), a protein required for lipoprotein assembly/secretion, as well as modestly increased PL content in the absence of improvements in mitochondrial content, lipid accumulation, or insulin sensitivity. In contrast, C-Ex rats had increased mitochondrial content and insulin sensitivity; however, this corresponded with minimal improvements in PL content and hepatic lipid accumulation. Importantly, ALA-Ex rats demonstrated additive improvements in PL content and hepatic steatosis, which corresponded with increased mitochondrial content, MTTP and apolipoprotein B100 content, greater serum triacylglyceride, and insulin sensitivity. Overall, these data demonstrate additive effects of ALA and exercise training on hepatic lipid accumulation, as exercise training preferentially increased mitochondrial content, while ALA promoted an environment conducive for lipid secretion. These data highlight the potential for combination therapy to mitigate liver disease progression.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25226826>Effects of stearidonic  on serum triacylglycerol concentrations in overweight and obese subjects: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), which may reduce the risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), can be synthesized at low rates from α- (ALA). The rate-limiting step for this conversion is the Δ6-desaturation of ALA into stearidonic  (SDA). Thus providing oils rich in SDA may increase endogenous synthesis of EPA, which may subsequently lower serum triacylglycerol concentrations, an effect frequently observed after EPA supplementation. We therefore studied the effects of Echium oil on serum triacylglycerol concentrations and the omega-3 index, which correlate negatively with the risk for CHD.A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial was conducted, in which 36 healthy overweight and slightly obese subjects daily received 10 g of Echium oil (providing 1.2 g of SDA) or a high oleic  sunflower oil (HOSO) as control for 6 weeks, with a washout period of at least 14 days. Four subjects dropped out. Differences between periods were tested for statistical significance (P<0.05) using a paired t-test.Serum triacylglycerol and other lipid concentrations were not significantly affected by consumption of Echium oil compared with HOSO. Echium oil significantly increased percentage of EPA in red blood cell (RBC) membranes with 0.14 ± 0.25% (mean ± s.d.) compared with HOSO (P=0.02). No significant effects on docosahexaenoic  in RBC membranes or on the omega-3 index were found.In healthy overweight and slightly obese subjects, an increased intake of SDA from Echium oil does not lower serum triacylglycerol concentrations.

In the human body, these fatty acids (FAs) give rise to arachidonic  (ARA, n-6), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, n-3), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, n-3) that play key roles in regulating body homeostasis. Locally acting bioactive signaling lipids called eicosanoids derived from these FAs also regulate diverse homeostatic processes. In general, ARA gives rise to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids whereas EPA and DHA give rise to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. Thus, a proportionally higher consumption of n-3 PUFAs can protect us against inflammatory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and other chronic diseases. The present review summarizes major sources, intake, and global consumption of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs.

TSL 95% ethanol extract exhibited the highest transactivity of PPARγ and contained the highest amounts of natural PPARγ ligands including palmitic , linoleic , and α- among different TSL ethanol extracts (0, 10, 50, 70, and 95%). The efficacy and the mechanism of TSL ethanol extract (95%) mediated anti-diabetic effects were examined by both in vivo and in vitro models in this study. An improved whole-body insulin sensitivity was observed in high-fat diet-fed (HFD) mice after 14 weeks of TSL treatment, as evidenced by a faster rate of plasma glucose clearing. The improved insulin sensitivity was through direct stimulation of PPARγ and adiponectin expression in adipose tissues of HFD mice. In addition to the PPARγ pathway, TSL stimulated glucose uptake via directly inducing AMPKα but not AS160 activation in C2C12 myotubes under palmitate-induced insulin resistance. TSL successfully induced sirtuin 1 and restored PGC1α, but failed to restore mitochondrial electron transport complexes I, III, IV and V in mRNA levels. Loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential coupled with AMPK activation suggests that TSL acts as a mitochondrial inhibitor to stimulate AMPK-mediated glucose uptake. This study demonstrated that TSL stimulated glucose uptake via AMPK activation in skeletal muscles and promoted PPARγ and normalized adiponectin expression in adipose tissues, thereby ameliorating insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26545644>EFFECT OF CHIA SEED (SALVIA HISPANICA L.)

The biases of risk analysis were carried out considering 6 of the 8 criteria of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.seven studies (n = 200) fit our inclusion criteria. Of the chosen clinical trials, only one was not randomized. Five of the studies were blind experiments. Two of the studies were acute trials, both of them randomized. Of the chia seed interventions, one study showed a significant drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and inflammatory markers, yet there was no change in body mass, lipid profile or blood sugar. In four of the studies reviewed there was a significant spike in ALA and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), with no significant change to other parameters. In the acute trials, post-prandial blood sugar was significantly lower. Only one study showed a significant drop in triglycerides (TG), body mass and inflammatory markers; however, the chia seed in that case was mixed with other foods. Most of the studies showed unclear or low risk of bias. Two studies showed a high risk of bias because not all the pre-specified primary outcomes were reported in the findings.most of the studies did not demonstrate statistically significant results in relation to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The evidence regarding the relationship between chia seed consumption and cardiovascular risk factors are insufficient, and the studies included in this review present numerous limitations. Further research is hence needed.Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014. Published by AULA MEDICA.

Monounsaturated fatty acids are reported to prevent atherosclerosis; emu oil is a rich source of monounsaturated fatty , and we hypothesize that emu oil supplementation could lower inflammation and prevent atherosclerosis in diet-induced obese (DIO) animals. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 6), and fed with normal diet (chow pellet; ND), or with cafeteria diet (CD), or with CD along with emu oil supplementation at three different doses: ED1 (2 mL), ED2 (4 mL) and ED3 (8 mL) kg(-1) body weight (BW), respectively.After 12 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and serum was analysed for measuring lipid profile, C-reactive proteins, testosterone and luteinizing hormone. Histopathological studies were performed to observe atherogenic changes in thoracic aorta. Restoration of altered lipid and hormonal profiles, and inhibition of atherogenic changes in thoracic aorta, were observed with supplementation of emu oil, confirming its anti-atherosclerotic activity.The high content of oleic  in emu oil could have orchestrated - either solely or in combination with linoleic and  acids - causing the upregulation of testosterone biosynthesis and inhibition of atheromatous plaque formation in diet-induced obese animals. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29702246>Placental lipid droplet composition: Effect of a lifestyle intervention (UPBEAT) in obese pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Maternal  is associated with adverse outcomes. Placental lipid droplets (LD) have been implicated in maternal-fetal lipid transfer but it is not known whether placental LD fat composition is modifiable. We evaluated the effects of a diet and physical activity intervention in obese pregnant women compared to routine antenatal care (UPBEAT study) on placental LD composition. LD were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Total FAs and phospholipids (phosphatidylcholines, PCs; sphingomyelins, SMs and lyso-phosphatidylcholines, Lyso-PCs) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Placenta MFSD2a expression was assessed by western blot. Placental LDs from obese women were comprised of predominantly saturated and monounsaturated FAs. TG and Chol composition was similar between intervention (n = 20) and control (n = 23) groups. PCs containing dihomo-ɣ- in LD were positively associated with gestational weight gain (P < 0.007), and lowered by the intervention. In the whole sample, PCs carrying DHA and arachidonic  were inversely associated with placental weight. Placenta MFSD2a expression was associated with DHA cord blood metabolites and relationships were observed between LD lipids, especially DHA carrying species, and cord blood metabolites. We describe placenta LD composition for the first time and demonstrate modest, potentially beneficial effects of a lifestyle intervention on LD FAs in obese pregnant women.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about the early markers associated with the development of metabolic abnormalities in MHO individuals. Serum free fatty acids (FFAs) profile is highlighted in its association with -related insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). To examine the association of endogenous fatty  metabolism with future development of metabolic abnormalities in MHO individuals, we retrospectively analyzed 24 [product FFA]/[precursor FFA] ratios in fasting sera and clinical data from 481 individuals who participated in three independent studies, including 131 metabolic healthy subjects who completed the 10-year longitudinal Shanghai Diabetes Study (SHDS), 312 subjects cross-sectionally sampled from the Shanghai  Study (SHOS), and 38 subjects who completed an 8-week very low carbohydrate diet (VLCD) intervention study. Results showed that higher baseline level of oleic /stearic  (OA/SA), and lower levels of stearic /palmitic  (SA/PA) and arachidonic /dihomo-γ- (AA/DGLA) ratios were associated with higher rate of MHO to MUO conversion in the longitudinal SHDS. Further, the finding was validated in the cross-sectional and interventional studies. This panel of FFA ratios could be used for identification and early intervention of at-risk obese individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28687367>The relationship between erythrocyte membrane fatty  levels and cardiac autonomic function in obese children.</a></h2><p>Childhood  is a worldwide health concern. Studies have shown autonomic dysfunction in obese children. The exact mechanism of this dysfunction is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between erythrocyte membrane fatty  (EMFA) levels and cardiac autonomic function in obese children using heart rate variability (HRV).A total of 48 obese and 32 healthy children were included in this case-control study. Anthropometric and biochemical data, HRV indices, and EMFA levels in both groups were compared statistically.HRV parameters including standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals (NN), root mean square of successive differences, the number of pairs of successive NNs that differ by >50 ms (NN50), the proportion of NN50 divided by the total number of NNs, high-frequency power, and low-frequency power were lower in obese children compared to controls, implying parasympathetic impairment. Eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  levels were lower in the obese group (p<0.001 and p=0.012, respectively). In correlation analysis, in the obese group, body mass index standard deviation and linoleic , arachidonic , triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein levels showed a linear correlation with one or more HRV parameter, and age, eicosapentaenoic , and systolic and diastolic blood pressure correlated with mean heart rate. In linear regression analysis, age, dihomo-gamma-, linoleic , arachidonic , body mass index standard deviation, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein were related to HRV parameters, implying an effect on cardiac autonomic function.There is impairment of cardiac autonomic function in obese children. It appears that levels of EMFAs such as linoleic , arachidonic  and dihomo-gamma- play a role in the regulation of cardiac autonomic function in obese children.Copyright © 2017 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

To investigate its antihyperlipidemic effect, a crude lipophilic extract and the composing compounds were isolated and fractioned from the petroleum ether extract of aerial parts of  using column chromatography on silica gel. The anti-hyperlipidemia effect was studied in a rat model of acute hyperlipidemia, which was induced by triton WR-1339. A new compound, integrinol (), together with nine known compounds, namely chamazulene (), acetylenes (E)-2 (), acetylenes (E)-3 (), eugenol (), palmitic  (), oleic  (), linoleic  (),  () and 12,13-epoxylinolenic  were isolated from the crude lipophilic extract of A. integrifolia. The LD50 value of the crude extract was more than 4g/kg. In Triton WR-1339-induced acute hyperlipidemia model, the crude lipophilic extract (200 mg/kg) significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) by 70% ( ≤ 0.01) and triglycerides (TGs) by 94% ( ≤ 0.001). The fractioned compounds, such as chamazulene (1), acetylene-2 (2), and  (9), used at 4 mg/kg dose, also significantly decreased the concentrations of TC (32%, 33% and 64%, respectively) and TGs (48%, 33% and 93%, respectively). These compounds (i.e., chamazulene, acetylenes (E)-2, and ) were considered to be responsible for the bioactive antihyperlipidemic effect. In conclusion, the crude lipid extract of Artemisia integrifolia L could be used as a potential treatment to avert hyperlipidemia. Further studies to confirm these results in other models of hyperlipidemia (e.g., diet-induced ) are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29465730>Dihomo-gamma- induces fat loss in C. elegans in an omega-3-independent manner by promoting peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation.</a></h2><p>Bioactive compounds, including some fatty acids (FAs), can induce beneficial effects on body fat-content and metabolism. In this work, we have used C. elegans as a model to examine the effects of several FAs on body fat accumulation. Both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids induced a reduction of fat content in C. elegans, with linoleic, gamma- and dihomo-gamma- acids being the most effective ones. These three FAs are sequential metabolites especially in omega-6 PUFA synthesis pathway and the effects seem to be primarily due to dihomo-gamma-, and independent of its transformation into omega-3 or arachidonic . Gene expression analyses suggest that peroxisomal beta oxidation is the main mechanism involved in the observed effect. These results point out the importance of further analysis of the activity of these omega-6 FAs, due to their potential application in  and related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26118785>Consumption of polyunsaturated fat improves the saturated fatty -mediated impairment of HDL antioxidant potential.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to compare the effects of diets containing high-fat, high-cholesterol and saturated fatty acids (HFHC-SFA) and HFHC-polyunsaturated fatty acids-containing (HFHC-PUFA) diets on two major antiatherogenic functions of HDL, the HDL antioxidant function and the macrophage-to-feces reverse cholesterol transport.Experiments were carried out in mice fed a low-fat, low-cholesterol (LFLC) diet, an HFHC-SFA diet or an HFHC-PUFA diet in which SFAs were partly replaced with an alternative high-linoleic and α- fat source. The HFHC-SFA caused a significant increase in serum HDL cholesterol and phospholipids as well as elevated levels of oxidized HDL and oxidized LDL. Replacing SFA with PUFA significantly reduced the levels of these oxidized lipoproteins and enhanced the ability of HDL to protect LDL from oxidation. The SFA-mediated impairment of HDL antioxidant potential was not associated with the cholesterol content of the diet,  or insulin resistance. In contrast, the effect of the HFHC diets on fecal macrophage-derived cholesterol excretion was independent of the fatty  source.SFA intake impairs the antioxidant potential of HDL and increases serum levels of oxidized lipoprotein species whereas the antioxidant potential of HDL is enhanced after PUFA consumption.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Rich in unsaturated fats, especially linoleic , soybean oil is assumed to be healthy, and yet it induces , diabetes, insulin resistance, and fatty liver in mice. Here, we show that the genetically modified soybean oil Plenish, which came on the U.S. market in 2014 and is low in linoleic , induces less  than conventional soybean oil in C57BL/6 male mice. Proteomic analysis of the liver reveals global differences in hepatic proteins when comparing diets rich in the two soybean oils, coconut oil, and a low-fat diet. Metabolomic analysis of the liver and plasma shows a positive correlation between  and hepatic C18 oxylipin metabolites of omega-6 (ω6) and omega-3 (ω3) fatty acids (linoleic and α-, respectively) in the cytochrome P450/soluble epoxide hydrolase pathway. While Plenish induced less insulin resistance than conventional soybean oil, it resulted in hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction as did olive oil, which has a similar fatty  composition.

It is the main component of seed oil from Punica granatum and Trichosanthes kirilowii. Previously, production of relatively high levels of this unusual fatty  in the seed oil of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plant was accomplished by the use of A. thaliana fad3/fae1 mutant high in linoleic  (18:2∆) and by co-expression of P. granatum FATTY  CONJUGASE (PgFADX) with Δ12-DESATURASE (FAD2). In the current study, P. granatum cDNAs governing PuA production were introduced into the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Expression of PgFADX alone resulted in production of PuA at the level of 19.6% of total fatty acids. Co-expression PgFADX with PgFAD2, however, further enhanced PuA content to 25.1% of total fatty acids, the highest level reported to date for heterologous expression. Therefore, microbial systems can be considered as a potential alternative to plant sources for a source of PuA for nutraceutic applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30255325>A UPLC/MS/MS method for comprehensive profiling and quantification of fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids in white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) are recently discovered lipids with antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory effects. We have developed an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS) method for comprehensive profiling and quantification of FAHFAs. Through optimization of the chromatographic conditions, most FAHFA isomers can be efficiently separated and quantified in 29 min with excellent peak shape and good robustness. UPLC coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS was used for identification of FAHFAs based on the high-resolution m/z values and the fragmentation rules. Sixty-four FAHFAs, belonging to 17 different families, were identified in white adipose tissue (WAT) of golden hamsters. Nine of the 17 FAHFA family members were newly discovered in this work, and linoleic  and  were newly found fatty  moieties of FAHFAs. The total number of FAHFAs identified from WAT in this work is far larger than that in any previously reported work. The parameters (precursor ions, product ions, and collision energy) of the 64 FAHFAs identified in golden hamster WAT by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS were further used in UPLC coupled with triple-quadrupole (QQQ) MS for quantification in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Finally, this newly developed UPLC/QQQ-MS method was used for the quantification of FAHFAs in hamster WAT attached to epididymis, kidney, intestine, and inguen to explore the disturbance of the levels of WAT FAHFAs in the pathological state of hyperlipidemia. The regulation effects of fenofibrate on the levels of WAT FAHFAs were also investigated. The results show that fenofibrate therapy can increase the concentration of FAHFAs in WAT.

The study also aimed to investigate the potentially adverse effects of an unbalanced diet on the distal intestine.Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups of eight animals each and were fed a basal or obesogenic (high in fat and low in fibre) diet that contained either rapeseed oil (Canola) or blackcurrant seed oil. A two-way analysis of variance was then applied to assess the effects of diet and oil and the interaction between them.After 8 weeks, the obesogenic dietary regimen increased the body weight, altered the plasma lipid profile and increased the liver fat content and the plasma transaminase activities. In addition, the obesogenic diet decreased bacterial glycolytic activity and short-chain fatty  formation in the distal intestine. Dietary blackcurrant seed oil improved the lipid metabolism by lowering liver fat accumulation and the plasma triglyceride concentration and atherogenicity as well by increasing the plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration. However, in rats fed an obesogenic diet containing blackcurrant seed oil, the plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration was comparable with both rapeseed oil-containing diets, and a significant elevation of the plasma transaminase activities was noted instead.The obesogenic dietary regimen causes a number of metabolic disorders, including alterations in the hindgut microbial metabolism. Dietary blackcurrant seed oil ameliorates the lipid metabolism; however, the beneficial effect is restricted when it is provided together with the obesogenic diet, and a risk of liver injury may occur.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521716>Inorganic mesoporous particles for controlled α- delivery to stimulate GLP-1 secretion in vitro.</a></h2><p>Novel treatment methods for  are urgently needed due to the increasing global severity of the problem. Gastrointestinal hormones, such as GLP-1 and PYY, are secreted by the enteroendocrine cells, playing a critical role in regulating food intake. Digested nutrients trigger the secretion of these hormones, which have a very short half-life. α- (αLA) has been shown to stimulate GLP-1 secretion, however, chemical instability and fast uptake in the small intestine hinder its use in body weight management. We developed a novel delivery system based on inorganic mesoporous particles for αLA to increase secretion of gastrointestinal peptides. αLA was loaded to thermally hydrocarbonized porous silicon particles (THCPSi). 47.9 ± 3.84% and 30.7 ± 2.86% of αLA was released during 6 h from 3.0% and 9.2% loading degree (w/w) samples in vitro, respectively. Native αLA (50 µM) significantly increased GLP-1 secretion from enteroendocrine STC-1 and GLUTag cell lines. αLA loaded THCPSi significantly and dose dependently stimulated GLP-1 secretion from STC-1 cells, whereas empty particles did not. We demonstrated in vitro that THCPSi particles have the potential to be used as a controlled delivery system for nutrients such as αLA, increasing GLP-1 secretion.

We previously reported that essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) improved whole-body glucose homeostasis in obese Zucker rats; however, the mechanisms underlying these benefits remain enigmatic. While PUFA and  influence skeletal muscle function, their effects on the secretome are unknown. The aim of this work was to determine if improvements in whole-body glucose homeostasis in obese Zucker rats fed diets supplemented with either linoleic  (LA) or  (ALA) for 12 wk are related to changes in the skeletal muscle secretome. Secreted proteins were identified with a predictive bioinformatic analysis of microarray gene expression from red tibialis anterior skeletal muscle. Approximately 130 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate = 0.05) in obese rats compared with lean controls. The expression of 15 genes encoding secreted proteins was differentially regulated in obese controls, obese LA-supplemented, and obese ALA-supplemented rats compared with lean controls. Five secreted proteins ( Col3a1, Col15a1, Pdgfd, Lyz2, and Angptl4) were differentially regulated by LA and ALA. Most notably, ALA supplementation reduced Angptl4 gene expression compared with obese control and obese-LA supplemented rats and reduced circulating ANGPTL4 serum concentrations. ALA also influenced Angptl4 gene expression and ANGPTL4 secretion from differentiated rat L6 myotubes. Altogether, the present data indicate that  has a greater global impact on skeletal muscle gene expression than either essential PUFA; however, LA and ALA may exert their metabolic benefits in part by regulating the skeletal muscle secretome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27321122>Consumption of -enriched Diacylglycerol Reduces Visceral Fat Area in Overweight and Obese Subjects: a Randomized, Double-blind Controlled, Parallel-group Designed Trial.</a></h2><p>A randomized, double-blind controlled, parallel-group designed trial was performed to investigate the effect of  (ALA)-enriched diacylglycerol (DAG) on visceral fat area (VFA) in obese subjects. One hundred eighty-four obese subjects were recruited and randomly allocated to two groups consuming either 2.5 g/d control triacylglycerol (TAG) or ALA-DAG for 12 wk. A 4-wk observation period followed the 12-wk consumption period. One hundred seventy-seven subjects (N=89 in the TAG group, N=88 in the ALA-DAG group) completed the study. The change in VFA at 12-wk from baseline, as the primary outcome, was significantly lower in the ALA-DAG group than in the TAG group. The reduction in VFA was significantly correlated with the baseline VFA. Body weight and waist circumference, as the secondary measures, were also significantly lower in the ALA-DAG group than in the TAG group. The reduction in the VFA was significantly correlated with body weight reduction, suggesting that the VFA reduction was a contributing factor preventing weight gain. Safety parameters and the incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between groups. In conclusion, ALA-DAG could be useful for reducing VFA and concomitantly suppressing weight gain with no side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25418385>Macronutrients: requirements and distribution.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28732058>The role of a FADS1 polymorphism in the association of fatty  blood levels, BMI and blood pressure in young children-Analyses based on path models.</a></h2><p>The recent  epidemic in children also showed an increase in the prevalence of hypertension. As blood pressure (BP) is associated with (long-chain) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC PUFA), genetic variation in desaturase enzymes being involved in the synthesis of LC PUFA may be associated with BP. This study aimed to investigate the direct effects (independent of mediating variables) and indirect effects (mediated through intermediate variables) of a common variant in the FADS1 gene, rs174546, known to affect delta-5 desaturase (D5D) activity on PUFA level, body mass index (BMI) and BP.A subsample of the IDEFICS (Identification and prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants) baseline survey including 520 children aged 2 to <10 years from six European countries was included. The association between rs174546 (T<C) and BP z-score as well as the mediating effects of selected key PUFA levels (dihomo-gamma-, DGLA; arachidonic , ARA; eicosapentaenoic , EPA) or estimated D5D activity (D5D index) and BMI z-score were investigated through path model analyses, adjusting for sex, age, educational level of parents, family history of hypertension, lifestyle factors and blood levels of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Whole blood fatty acids were measured by a validated gas chromatographic method and recorded as percentage of weight of all fatty acids detected.Minor allele carriers of the SNP rs174546 had significantly higher DGLA and lower ARA and EPA levels as well as a lower D5D index. Via ARA and BMI z-score, the polymorphism had an indirect lowering effect on systolic BP z-score for each additional T allele (standardized effect estimate -0.057, p = 0.007). For DGLA, EPA and D5D index, the indirect effects of rs174546 on systolic BP were also negative but did not reach significance. DGLA and EPA had an increasing indirect effect on systolic BP via BMI. Results for diastolic BP were in general similar but effect estimates were lower compared to systolic BP.Genetic variation in FADS1 influences BP via ARA and BMI indicating a favorable effect of the minor allele in SNP rs174546. Thus, polymorphisms with an impact on the D5D activity may play a role for the BP level mediated through PUFA and BMI. Therefore, health effects of dietary n-6 and n-3 PUFA may vary depending on genetic FADS1 variants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29502183>Bioactivity and biotechnological production of punicic .</a></h2><p>Punicic  (PuA; 18: 3Δ  ) is an unusual 18-carbon fatty  bearing three conjugated double bonds.

While both PuA and pomegranate seed oil have been used as functional ingredients in foods and cosmetics for some time, their value in pharmaceutical/medical and industrial applications are presently under further exploration. Unfortunately, the availability of PuA is severely limited by the low yield and unstable supply of pomegranate seeds. In addition, efforts to produce PuA in transgenic crops have been limited by a relatively low content of PuA in the resulting seed oil.

Delta-5 desaturase (D5D) is an enzyme that metabolizes dihomo-γ- (DGLA) to arachidonic  (AA). Thus, D5D inhibition increases DGLA (precursor to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids) while decreasing AA (precursor to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids), and could result in synergistic improvement in the low-grade inflammatory state. Here, we demonstrate reduced insulin resistance and the anti- effect of a D5D selective inhibitor (compound-326), an orally active small-molecule, in a high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model. In vivo D5D inhibition was confirmed by determining changes in blood AA/DGLA profiles. In DIO mice, chronic treatment with compound-326 lowered insulin resistance and caused body weight loss without significant impact on cumulative calorie intake. Decreased macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue was expected from mRNA analysis. Increased daily energy expenditure was also observed following administration of compound-326, in line with sustained body weight loss.

Minor differences were found in postprandial responses for AAs between MHO and MUO individuals, while three polyunsaturated FAs (linoleic , γ-, arachidonic ) showed smaller changes in serum after the meal in MHO individuals compared to MUO. Fasting levels for various AAs (notably branched-chain AA) and FAs (e.g., saturated myristic and palmitic acids) were found to correlate with glucose and insulin AUC.MHO individuals show preserved insulin sensitivity and a greater ability to adapt to a caloric challenge compared to MUO individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28465608>Depot-specific differences in fatty  composition and distinct associations with lipogenic gene expression in abdominal adipose tissue of obese women.</a></h2><p>Cardiometabolic diseases are primarily linked to enlarged visceral adipose tissue (VAT).

The results showed that the ratio of dihomo-γ- (DGLA) to deoxycholic  (DCA) species (DCAS) was significantly increased in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) from a case-control study and decreased in the remission group of obese subjects with T2DM after metabolic surgery. The changes were closely associated with their metabolic status. These results were consistently confirmed in both serum and liver of mice with diet-induced , implying that such a metabolic alteration in circulation reflects changes occurring in the liver.  studies of human liver L-02 cell lines under BA treatment revealed that DCA and its conjugated form, TDCA, significantly inhibited mRNA expression of fatty  transport protein 5 in the presence of DGLA, which was involved in hepatocyte DGLA uptake. Thus, the DGLA:DCAS ratio may be a promising biomarker for metabolic abnormalities in .-Lei, S., Huang, F., Zhao, A., Chen, T., Chen, W., Xie, G., Zheng, X., Zhang, Y., Yu, H., Zhang, P., Rajani, C., Bao, Y., Jia, W., Jia, W.

Recent studies have focused on the extent to which -induced insulin resistance is mediated through oxylipins, derived from enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation. Vitamin E and vitamin C are widely used antioxidant supplements, but conflicting data exist as to whether supplementation with vitamins E and C reduces insulin resistance. The purpose of this work is (1) to test the hypothesis that supplementation with vitamin E and vitamin C prevents the development of insulin resistance and (2) to determine the extent to which antioxidant supplementation modifies -induced changes in hepatic oxylipins. Using -prone Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high-fat, hypercaloric diet, we found that vitamin E and C supplementation did not block the development of insulin resistance, despite increased plasma levels of these antioxidants and decreased hepatic F2-isoprostane (F2-IsoP) concentrations. The obese phenotype was associated with increased hepatic concentrations of cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-dependent linoleic  and α--derived epoxides. Antioxidant supplementation, but not , decreased levels of the lipoxygenase (LOX)-dependent, arachidonic -derived products lipoxin A4 (LXA4), 8,15-dihydroxtetraenoate (8,15-DiHETE), and 5,15-DiHETE.

We have previously shown that exposure to a low-protein diet during gestation was associated with upregulation of genes associated with cholesterol transport and packaging within the placenta. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of altering maternal dietary linoleic  (LA; omega-6) to  (ALA; omega-6) ratios as well as total fat content on placental expression of genes associated with cholesterol transport. The potential for maternal body mass index (BMI) to be associated with expression of these genes in human placental samples was also evaluated. Placentas were collected from 24 Wistar rats at 20-day gestation (term = 21-22-day gestation) that had been fed one of four diets containing varying fatty  compositions during pregnancy, and from 62 women at the time of delivery. Expression of 14 placental genes associated with cholesterol packaging and transfer was assessed in rodent and human samples by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. In rats, placental mRNA expression of ApoA2, ApoC2, Cubn, Fgg, Mttp and Ttr was significantly elevated (3-30 fold) in animals fed a high LA (36% fat) diet, suggesting increased cholesterol transport across the placenta in this group. In women, maternal BMI was associated with fewer inconsistent alterations in gene expression. In summary, sub-optimal maternal nutrition is associated with alterations in the expression of genes associated with cholesterol transport in a rat model. This may contribute to altered fetal development and potentially programme disease risk in later life. Further investigation of human placenta in response to specific dietary interventions is required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28988484>Flaxseed Oil Alleviates Chronic HFD-Induced Insulin Resistance through Remodeling Lipid Homeostasis in Obese Adipose Tissue.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence suggests that higher circulating long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFA) levels were intimately associated with lower prevalence of  and insulin resistance. However, the understanding of bioactivity and potential mechanism of α--rich flaxseed oil (ALA-FO) against insulin resistance was still limited. This study evaluated the effect of FO on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance in C57BL/6J mice focused on adipose tissue lipolysis. Mice after HFD feeding for 16 weeks (60% fat-derived calories) exhibited systemic insulin resistance, which was greatly attenuated by medium dose of FO (M-FO), paralleling with differential accumulation of ALA and its n-3 derivatives across serum lipid fractions. Moreover, M-FO was sufficient to effectively block the metabolic activation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), thereby improving adipose tissue insulin signaling. Importantly, suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α were involved in FO-mediated modulation of adipose tissue lipolysis, accompanied by specific reconstitution of n-3PUFA within adipose tissue lipid fractions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26743332>Effect of Increasing Doses of Linoleic and α- Acids on High-Fructose and High-Fat Diet Induced Metabolic Syndrome in Rats.</a></h2><p>Doses and ratio of linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA) preventing metabolic syndrome (MS) were investigated.

The BP-lowering effect of n-3 FA supplements among Chinese hypertensive patients has been reported in our previous 12-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT), but the benefits on cardiometabolic profiles among obese Chinese populations are not well known. We therefore used the data from the previous RCT to investigate the effects of marine- and plant-derived n-3 FA supplements on cardiometabolic profiles in middle-aged and elderly Chinese hypertensive patients with abdominal . In total, 108 eligible volunteers from Inner Mongolia, China were randomly assigned to three treatments for 12 weeks: fish oil (FO, n = 35, 2 g day-1 eicosapentaenoic  + docosahexaenoic ), flaxseed oil (FLO, n = 39, 2.5 g day-1 α-), and corn oil served as a control (CO, n = 34). BP, blood lipids, waist circumference (WC) and fasting glucose-insulin were measured at baseline and after 12-week intervention by using standard methods. Clustered cardiometabolic risk was expressed as a continuously distributed z-score calculated by standardizing and then summing WC, insulin, glucose, TG, HDL-cholesterol and BP values. The cardiometabolic risk scores were significantly lower in the FO group than in the CO group after the 12-week intervention (-0.41 ± 0.92 vs. 0.02 ± 0.95, p = 0.016), but not in the FLO group (-0.23 ± 1.02 vs. 0.02 ± 0.95, p = 0.109).

Anthropometric evaluation, liver ultrasound examination and scoring for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD score = 0-6), and biochemical and plasma fatty acids analysis were performed. We compared the composition ratio of fatty acids between children with high-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 4-6), low-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 1-3), and healthy controls (NAFLD score = 0). In addition, correlation coefficients (r) between NAFLD score, metabolic variables, and estimated activity of desaturase indices (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1), delta-5 and delta-6 desaturase) were calculated.Compared with healthy controls, children with liver steatosis showed a higher proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (21.16 ± 2.81% vs. 19.68 ± 2.71%, p = 0.024). In addition, children with high- grade liver steatosis exhibited higher proportions of palmitic  (C16:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1n-7), dihomo-γ- (C20:3n-6), adrenic  (C22:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic  (C22:5n-6); and lower proportions of eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3) (P< 0.05).

It has been revealed that α- (ALA), a plant-based essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, reduces adipose tissue lipolysis. However, it is not known whether G0S2 is implicated in ALA-induced inhibition of lipolysis. The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the effect of ALA on G0S2 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of obese patients and the potential influence of G0S2 gene expression in ALA-induced inhibition of lipolysis.A total of 26 obese patients were randomly assigned to be treated with or without ALA treatment (~4.0 g daily) for 12 weeks: the ALA-treated group (n = 14) or the untreated control group (n = 12). Plasma triglyceride (TG), free fatty acids (FFA), glycerol, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well as the mRNA expression levels of proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), G0S2, and G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) in PBMC were repeatedly examined from fasting obese patients before and after ALA treatment.ALA significantly decreased plasma TG, FFA, glycerol, IL-6, and TNF-α levels and increased the mRNA expression levels of PPAR-γ, G0S2, and GPR120 in PBMC, compared with the untreated control group. In obese patients from the ALA-treated group, decreased plasma FFA (a biomarker for lipolysis) level was significantly correlated with increased PPAR-γ (a functional omega-3 fatty acids receptor) and G0S2 (a direct target gene of PPAR-γ) mRNA expression in PBMC, while decreased plasma FFA level was not correlated with increased GPR120 (another functional omega-3 fatty acids receptor) mRNA expression in PBMC.This study shows that ALA increases G0S2 gene expression in PBMC in parallel with the decrease of plasma FFA level in obese patients. Increased G0S2 gene expression might contribute to the beneficial anti-lipolytic effect of ALA in obese patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29471812>Effect of weight loss on circulating fatty  profiles in overweight subjects with high visceral fat area: a 12-week randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Significant associations between visceral fat and alterations in plasma fatty acids have been identified in overweight individuals.

We investigated the effect of weight loss with mild calorie restriction on the circulating fatty  profiles and desaturase activities in nondiabetic overweight subjects with high VFA.Eighty overweight subjects with high VFA (L4 VFA ≥100 cm) were randomized into the 12-week mild-calorie-restriction (300 kcal/day) or control groups.Comparison of the percent of body weight changes between groups revealed that the weight-loss group had greater reductions in body weight. The VFA decreased by 17.7 cm from baseline in the weight-loss group (P < 0.001). At follow-up, the weight-loss group showed greater reductions in serum triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR than the control group. Significantly greater reductions in total saturated fatty acids, palmitic , stearic , total monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , oleic , eicosadienoic , and dihomo-γ- levels were detected in the weight-loss group compared with the control group after adjusting for baseline values. Following weight loss, C16 Δ9-desaturase activity was significantly decreased and Δ5-desaturase activity was significantly increased, and the changes were greater in the weight-loss group than in the control group.The results suggest that mild weight loss improves abdominal , overall fatty  profiles, and desaturase activities; therefore, mild calorie restriction has potential health benefits related to -related diseases in overweight subjects with high VFA..

The aim of this study was to assess the role of dietary fat quantity and fatty  composition in body composition, insulin resistance, and insulin secretion. An open parallel randomized trial design was used. Overweight participants ( = 75) were randomized to follow a low-fat vegan ( = 38) or control diet ( = 37) for 16 weeks. Dual X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure body composition. Insulin resistance was assessed with the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) index. Insulin secretion was assessed after stimulation with a liquid breakfast (Boost Plus, Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland). Self-reported 3-day diet records were used to assess dietary intake. A linear regression model was used to test the relationship between fat intake and body composition, insulin resistance, and insulin secretion. Changes in fat intake expressed as percent of total energy consumed correlated positively with changes in fat mass ( = 0.52;  < 0.001; and 0.347;  = 0.006, respectively), even after adjustment for changes in body-mass index (BMI) and energy intake (0.33;  = 0.01).

Preclinical studies have identified over 1000 molecules with brain-protective properties. More than 200 clinical trials have evaluated neuroprotective candidates for ischemic stroke yet, to date almost all failed, leading to a re-analysis of treatment strategies against stroke. An emerging view is to seek combinatory therapy, or discovering molecules able to stimulate multiple protective and regenerative mechanisms. A pertinent experimental approach to identify such candidates is the study of brain preconditioning, which refers to how the brain protects itself against ischemia and others stress-inducing stimuli. The recent discovery that nutrients like  (ALA is an essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  required as part of our daily diet), may be an efficient brain preconditionner against stroke fosters the novel concept of brain preconditioning by nutraceuticals. This review stresses the underestimated role of nutrition in preventing and combating stroke. Although there is a consensus that increased consumption of salt, fatty foods and alcoholic beverages may promote pathologies like hypertension,  and alcoholism - all of which are well known risk factors of stroke - few risk factors are attributed to a deficiency in an essential nutrient in the diet. The ALA deficiency observed in the Western modern diets may itself constitute a risk factor. This review outlines how ALA supplementation by modification of the daily diet prevented mortality and cerebral damage in a rodent model of ischemic stroke. It also describes the pleiotropic ability of ALA to trigger responses that are multicellular, mechanistically diverse, resulting in neuronal protection, stimulation of neuroplasticity, and brain artery vasodilation. Overall, this review proposes a promising therapeutic opportunity by integrating a nutritional-based approach focusing on enriching the daily diet in ALA to prevent the devastating damage caused by stroke.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Since serine-3 acylation with octanoylate (octanoylation) is essential for the orexigenic activity of ghrelin, suppression of octanoylation could lead to amelioration or prevention of . To enable the exploration of inhibitors of octanoylated ghrelin production, we developed a cell-based assay system using AGS-GHRL8 cells, in which octanoylated ghrelin concentration increases in the presence of octanoic . Using this assay system, we investigated whether fatty acids contained in foods or oils, such as acetic , stearic , oleic , linoleic , and α-, have inhibitory effects on octanoylated ghrelin production. Acetic  did not suppress the increase in octanoylated ghrelin production in AGS-GHRL8 cells, which was induced by the addition of octanoic . However, stearic , oleic , linoleic , and α- significantly suppressed octanoylated ghrelin production, with the effect of oleic  being the strongest. Additionally, oleic  decreased the serum concentration of octanoylated ghrelin in mice. The serum concentration of des-acyl ghrelin (without acyl modification) was also decreased, but the decrease was smaller than that of octanoylated ghrelin. Decreased octanoylated ghrelin production likely resulted from post-translational ghrelin processing, as there were no significant differences in gene expression in the stomach between oleic -treated mice and controls. These results suggest that oleic  is a potential inhibitor of octanoylated ghrelin production and that our assay system is a valuable tool for screening compounds with suppressive effects on octanoylated ghrelin production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27088787>[Desaturases of fatty acids (FADS) and their physiological and clinical implication].</a></h2><p>States associated with insulin resistance, as overweight/, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), some cancers and neuropsychiatric diseases are characterized with a decrease of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) levels. Amounts of LC-PUFA depend on the exogenous intake of their precursors [linoleic (LA) and α- (ALA)] and by rate of their metabolism, which is influenced by activities of enzymes, such as Δ6-desaturase (D6D, FADS2), D5D, FADS1, elongases (Elovl2, -5, 6).Altered activities of D5D/D6D were described in plenty of diseases, e.g. neuropsychiatric (depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, dementia), metabolic (, metabolic syndrome, DM2) and cardiovascular diseases (arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease), inflammatory states and allergy (Crohns disease, atopic eczema) or some malignancies. Similar results were obtained in studies dealing with the associations between genotypes/haplotypes of FADS1/FADS2 and above mentioned diseases, or interactions of dietary intake of LA and ALA on one hand and of the polymorphisms of minor allels of FADS1/FADS2, usually characterized by lower activities, on the other hand.The decrease of the desaturases activities leads to decreased concentrations of products with concomitant increased concentrations of substrates. Associations of some SNP FADS with coronary heart disease, concentrations of plasma lipids, oxidative stress, glucose homeostasis, and inflammatory reaction, were described.

Changes in conventional semen parameters (pH, volume, sperm count and concentration, motility, and morphology) were determined as primary outcomes. The effect of nut consumption on sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, chromosome anomalies (X, Y, and 18), total DNA methylation, and microRNA expression were measured in sperm samples as potential causes of the changes in the seminogram.Compared with the control group, improvements in total sperm count (P = 0.002) and vitality (P = 0.003), total motility (P = 0.006), progressive motility (P = 0.036), and morphology of sperm (P = 0.008) were observed in the nut group.

FX cocultures reduced (i) secreted IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α), and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) levels; (ii) activation of inflammatory transcription factors NFκB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell) p65 and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3); and (iii) RAW264.7 macrophage chemotaxis versus CON (p ≤ 0.05). Coculture of pre-inflamed adipocytes (10 ng/mL LPS, 24 h prior to CD8(+) T-cell addition) resulted in reduced secretion of IL-6, IL-1β, MCP-1, MCP-3, MIP-1β, and RANTES in FX cocultures versus CON (p ≤ 0.05).FX exerts an anti-chemotactic and anti-inflammatory effect on CD8(+) T cell/adipocyte paracrine interactions (cross-talk), which has the potential to mitigate macrophage chemotaxis which drives components of the obese phenotype.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

CAN manifests in a spectrum of things, ranging from resting tachycardia and fixed heart rate (HR) to development of "silent" myocardial infarction. Clinical correlates or risk markers for CAN are age, DM duration, glycemic control, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (DLP), development of other microvascular complications. Established risk factors for CAN are poor glycemic control in type 1 DM and a combination of hypertension, DLP, , and unsatisfactory glycemic control in type 2 DM. Symptomatic manifestations of CAN include sinus tachycardia, exercise intolerance, orthostatic hypotension (OH), abnormal blood pressure (BP) regulation, dizziness, presyncope and syncope, intraoperative cardiovascular instability, asymptomatic myocardial ischemia and infarction. Methods of CAN assessment in clinical practice include assessment of symptoms and signs,  based on HR and BP, short-term electrocardiography (ECG), QT interval prolongation, HR variability (24 h, classic 24 h Holter ECG), ambulatory BP monitoring, HR turbulence, baroreflex sensitivity, muscle sympathetic nerve activity, catecholamine assessment and cardiovascular sympathetic tests, heart sympathetic imaging. Although it is common complication, the significance of CAN has not been fully appreciated and there are no unified treatment algorithms for today. Treatment is based on early diagnosis, life style changes, optimization of glycemic control and management of cardiovascular risk factors. Pathogenetic treatment of CAN includes: Balanced diet and physical activity; optimization of glycemic control; treatment of DLP; antioxidants, first of all α-lipoic  (ALA), aldose reductase inhibitors, acetyl-L-carnitine; vitamins, first of all fat-soluble vitamin B1; correction of vascular endothelial dysfunction; prevention and treatment of thrombosis; in severe cases-treatment of OH. The promising methods include prescription of prostacyclin analogues, thromboxane A2 blockers and drugs that contribute into strengthening and/or normalization of Na, K-ATPase (phosphodiesterase inhibitor), ALA, dihomo-γ- (DGLA), ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs), and the simultaneous prescription of ALA, ω-3 PUFAs and DGLA, but the future investigations are needed. Development of OH is associated with severe or advanced CAN and prescription of nonpharmacological and pharmacological, in the foreground midodrine and fludrocortisone acetate, treatment methods are necessary.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30502680>Chia oil supplementation changes body composition and activates insulin signaling cascade in skeletal muscle tissue of obese animals.</a></h2><p>Chia seed oil is the richest source of plant-based ω-3 fatty , α-, but its potential and mechanisms of action to treat  are unclear. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of chia oil (ChOi) supplementation on body composition and insulin signaling in skeletal muscles of obese mice.Male C57 BL/6 mice (n = 8/group) were fed regular control chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 135 d. Another HFD group additionally received ChOi from 90 to 135 d.Consumption of ChOi reduced fat mass accumulation and increased lean mass as evidenced by nuclear magnetic resonance. Moreover, obese mice treated with ChOi showed higher tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, greater activation of protein kinase B, and increased translocation of glucose transporter type 4 in skeletal muscle tissue in response to insulin. ChOi supplementation improved glucose levels and insulin tolerance; decreased serum insulin, leptin, and triacylglycerols; and increased blood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. All these effects caused by the use of ChOi seemed to be independent of the resolution of inflammation because the markers of inflammation were not altered in animals fed the HFD.The molecular effects observed in muscle tissue together with changes in body composition may have contributed to the increased glucose tolerance and to the healthy phenotype presented by obese animals treated with ChOi.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This work studied the increase in total FFA shown in NAFLD subjects to possibly characterize which fatty acids significantly accounted for the whole increase.21 patients with NAFLD were selected according to specified criteria. The control group consisted of nine healthy subjects. All subjects underwent an oral standard fat load. Triglycerides; cholesterol; FFA; glucose and insulin were measured every 2 h with the determination of fatty  composition of FFA.higher serum FFA levels in NAFLD subjects are mainly due to levels of oleic, palmitic and linoleic acids at different times. Significant increases were shown for docosahexaenoic , , eicosatrienoic , and arachidonic , although this was just on one occasion. In the postprandial phase, homeostatic model assessment HOMA index positively correlated with the ω3/ω6 ratio in NAFLD patients.the higher serum levels of FFA in NAFLD subjects are mainly due to levels of oleic and palmitic acids which are the most abundant circulating free fatty acids. This is almost exactly corresponded with significant increases in linoleic . An imbalance in the n-3/n-6 fatty acids ratio could modulate postprandial responses with more pronounced effects in insulin-resistant subjects, such as NAFLD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26280128>Diets Containing α- (ω3) or Oleic (ω9) Fatty Acids Rescues Obese Mice From Insulin Resistance.</a></h2><p>Subclinical systemic inflammation is a hallmark of  and insulin resistance. The results obtained from a number of experimental studies suggest that targeting different components of the inflammatory machinery may result in the improvement of the metabolic phenotype. Unsaturated fatty acids exert antiinflammatory activity through several distinct mechanisms. Here, we tested the capacity of ω3 and ω9 fatty acids, directly from their food matrix, to exert antiinflammatory activity through the G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)120 and GPR40 pathways. GPR120 was activated in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues, reverting inflammation and insulin resistance in obese mice. Part of this action was also mediated by GPR40 on muscle, as a novel mechanism described. Pair-feeding and immunoneutralization experiments reinforced the pivotal role of GPR120 as a mediator in the response to the nutrients. The improvement in insulin sensitivity in the high-fat substituted diets was associated with a marked reduction in tissue inflammation, decreased macrophage infiltration, and increased IL-10 levels. Furthermore, improved glucose homeostasis was accompanied by the reduced expression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes and reduced body mass. Thus, our data indicate that GPR120 and GPR40 play a critical role as mediators of the beneficial effects of dietary unsaturated fatty acids in the context of -induced insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25641170>Proinflammatory effects of arachidonic  in a lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory microenvironment in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in vitro.</a></h2><p>Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), eicosapentaenoic  (20:5n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (22:6n-3, DHA), have known anti-inflammatory effects, including the modulation of adipose tissue-derived inflammatory mediators (i.e., adipokines) implicated in -related pathologies, such as insulin resistance. Less is known about the effects of plant-derived n-3 PUFA, α- (ALA, 18:3n-3) and stearidonic  (SDA 18:4n-3), or n-6 PUFA linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6) and arachidonic  (AA, 20:4n-6), especially in combination with an inflammatory stimulus, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), at a dose intended to mimic -associated low-grade inflammation. To study this, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 100 μmol/L of various n-3 or n-6 PUFA with or without 10 ng/mL LPS for up to 24 h. AA in the presence of LPS synergistically increased (p < 0.05) pro-inflammatory monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP)-1 and interleukin (IL)-6 secretion and gene expression, as well as COX-2 and TLR2 gene expression at 6 and/or 24 h, suggesting their potential roles in the synergistic effects of AA and LPS. Plant-derived fatty acids ALA, SDA, and LA did not differentially affect adipokine gene expression or secretion, whereas LPS-induced pro-inflammatory IL-1β expression and MCP-1 secretion was decreased (p < 0.05) by EPA, DHA, and/or EPA+DHA (50 μmol/L each) compared with LPS alone. Only DHA increased (p < 0.05) gene expression of the n-3 PUFA receptor GPR120 and simultaneously decreased LPS-induced nuclear factor-κB activation compared with control. Our findings emphasize that specific fatty acids within the n-3 or n-6 PUFA class warrant consideration in the development of nutritional strategies to improve -associated inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29441023>Comparison of Fatty  and Gene Profiles in Skeletal Muscle in Normal and Obese C57BL/6J Mice before and after Blunt Muscle Injury.</a></h2><p>Injury and  are two major health burdens affecting millions of people worldwide.  is recognized as a state of chronic inflammation accompanied by various co-morbidities like T2D or cardiovascular diseases. There is increasing evidence that  impairs muscle regeneration, which is mainly due to chronic inflammation and to excessive accumulation of lipids in adipose and non-adipose tissue. To compare fatty  profiles and changes in gene expression at different time points after muscle injury, we used an established drop tower-based model with a defined force input to damage the  on the left hind limb of female C57BL/6J mice of normal weight and obese mice. Although most changes in fatty  content in muscle tissue are diet related, levels of eicosaenoic (normal weight) and DHG- (obese) in the phospholipid and docosahexaenoic  (normal weight) in the triglyceride fraction are altered after injury. Furthermore, changes in gene transcription were detected in 3829 genes in muscles of normal weight mice, whereas only 287 genes were altered in muscles of obese mice after trauma. Alterations were found within several pathways, among them notch-signaling, insulin-signaling, sonic hedgehog-signaling, apoptosis related pathways, fat metabolism related cholesterol homeostasis, fatty  biosynthetic process, fatty  elongation, and acyl-CoA metabolic process. We could show that genes involved in fat metabolism are affected 3 days after trauma induction mostly in normal weight but not in obese mice. The strongest effects were observed in normal weight mice for , the activating protein for leukotriene synthesis, and , an enzyme substantial for LDL synthesis. In summary, we show that  changes the fat content of skeletal muscle and generally shows a negative impact upon blunt muscle injury on various cellular processes, among them fatty  related metabolism, notch-, insulin-, sonic hedgehog-signaling, and apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29698923>Anti-inflammatory effects of α- in M1-like macrophages are associated with enhanced production of oxylipins from α- and linoleic .</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation, mediated in large part by proinflammatory macrophage populations, contributes directly to the induction and perpetuation of metabolic diseases, including , insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can have profound effects on inflammation through the formation of bioactive oxygenated metabolites called oxylipins. The objective of this study was to determine if exposure to the dietary omega-3 PUFA α- (ALA) can dampen the inflammatory properties of classically activated (M1-like) macrophages derived from the human THP-1 cell line and to examine the accompanying alterations in oxylipin secretion. We find that ALA treatment leads to a reduction in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α production. Although ALA is known to be converted to longer-chain PUFAs eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), DHA oxylipins were reduced overall by ALA treatment, as was LPS-induced secretion of EPA oxylipins. In contrast, we observed profound increases in oxylipins directly derived from ALA. Lipoxygenase products of linoleic  were also dramatically increased, and LPS-induced production of AA oxylipins, particularly prostaglandin D2, was reduced. These results suggest that ALA may act to dampen the inflammatory phenotype of M1-like macrophages by a unique set of mechanisms distinct from those used by the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. Thus, there is strong rationale for investigating the functions of ALA oxylipins and lesser-known LA oxylipins since they hold promise as anti-inflammatory agents.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In such association studies, fatty acids have typically been expressed as the percentage of a particular fatty  relative to the total fatty acids in a sample. Using two human cohorts, this study examined relationships between blood lipids (TAG, and LDL, HDL or total cholesterol) and circulating fatty acids expressed either as a percentage of total or as concentration in serum. The direction of the correlation between stearic , linoleic , dihomo-γ-, arachidonic  and DHA and circulating TAG reversed when fatty acids were expressed as concentrations v. a percentage of total. Similar reversals were observed for these fatty acids when examining their associations with the ratio of total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol. This reversal pattern was replicated in serum samples from both human cohorts. The correlations between blood lipids and fatty acids expressed as a percentage of total could be mathematically modelled from the concentration data. These data reveal that the different methods of expressing fatty acids lead to dissimilar correlations between blood lipids and certain fatty acids. This study raises important questions about how such reversals in association patterns impact the interpretation of numerous association studies evaluating fatty acids and their relationships with disease biomarkers or risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26021978>Effects of  and gestational diabetes mellitus on placental phospholipids.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with adverse effects in the offspring. The composition of placental glycerophospholipids (GPL) is known to be altered in GDM and might reflect an aberrant fatty  transfer across the placenta and thus affect the foetal body composition. The aim of this study was to investigate possible effects of  and GDM, respectively, on placental GPL species composition. We investigated molecular species of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) in term placentas from controls (lean non-diabetic, body-mass-index [BMI] 18-24.9k g/m(2), n=31), obese non-diabetics (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2), n=17) and lean diabetics (n=15), using liquid chromatography - triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. PE(16:0/22:6) and PE(18:0/20:4) were increased in GDM and decreased species were PC(18:0/20:3), PC(18:1/20:3) and PS(18:0/18:2). A consistent difference between BMI related changes and changes caused by GDM was not observed. Arachidonic  percentages of cord blood correlated with placental PC(16:0/20:4), whereas foetal docosahexaenoic  correlated to placental PE species. Furthermore, a positive correlation of placental weight was found to levels of PE containing arachidonic . We demonstrated that  and GDM are associated with decreased dihomo-gamma- and increased arachidonic  and docosahexaenoic  contents of placental GPL, with unknown consequences for the foetus. PC(16:0/20:4) was identified as the major component for the supply of arachidonic  to the foetal circulation, whereas PE containing arachidonic  was found to be associated to the placental and infant growth.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2015.

There are no previous data on the association of plasma fatty  (FA) composition with plasma irisin.We studied the association of FA composition with plasma irisin in normal weight and overweight/obese children.This cross-sectional study included pre-pubertal children (388 normal weight children and 55 overweight/obese children); 6-9 years of age, taking part in the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children Study. After an overnight fast, we measured plasma FA composition by gas chromatography and plasma irisin levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Higher proportion of total monounsaturated fatty acids in plasma cholesteryl esters (CEs) (β = 0.139, P = 0.003) and phospholipids (PLs) (β = 0.147, P = 0.002) and lower proportion of total polyunsaturated fatty acids in plasma CE (β = -0.130, P = 0.006) and PL (β = -0.165, P < 0.001) were associated with higher plasma irisin level in the whole study group. The association of plasma FA composition with plasma irisin level was stronger among overweight/obese children compared to normal weight children. Higher proportion of γ- (β = 0.324, P = 0.017) and lower proportion of linoleic  (β = -0.397, P = 0.005) in plasma CE were related to higher plasma irisin level among overweight/obese children, indicating the direct association of estimated D6D activity in plasma CE (β = 0.343, P = 0.011) with plasma irisin. Furthermore, higher proportion of oleic  in plasma CE (β = 0.345, P = 0.012) and PL (β = 0.292, P = 0.033) and higher proportion of adrenic  (β = 0.366, P = 0.008) and docosapentaenoic  (β = 0.351, P = 0.010) in plasma PL were associated with higher plasma irisin level among overweight/obese children.Metabolically unfavourable plasma FA profile was associated with higher plasma irisin level especially in overweight/obese children, suggesting that excess body fat might modulate these relationships.© 2015 World .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30009862>Effects of dietary -enriched diacylglycerol oil on embryo/fetal development in rats.</a></h2><p>Recent studies suggest that diets supplemented with  (ALA)-enriched diacylglycerol (DAG) oil provide potential health benefits in preventing or managing . However, available safety information about reproductive and developmental toxicities of ALA-DAG oil is limited. This study was conducted to clarify the effect, if any, of ALA-DAG oil on embryo-fetal development, following maternal exposure during the critical period of major organogenesis. ALA-DAG oil was administered via gavage to pre-mated female Sprague Dawley rats from gestation day 6 through 19, at dose levels of 0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 mL/kg/day (equivalent to 0, 1149, 2325, and 4715 mg/kg/day, respectively), with total volume adjusted to 5 mL/kg/day with rapeseed oil. All females survived to the scheduled necropsy. There were no treatment-related changes in clinical or internal findings, maternal body weights, feed consumption, intrauterine growth, survival, and number of implantations. No ALA-DAG oil-related fetal malformations or developmental variations were noted. A maternal maximum tolerated dose for ALA-DAG oil could not be achieved in this study. Based on these results, a dose level of 5.0 mL/kg (4715 mg/kg/day), the highest dose tested, was considered as the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for both maternal and developmental toxicity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) reported associations between polymorphisms in FADS1-FADS2 and variations in plasma concentrations of PUFAs, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. However, it is not established whether dietary PUFAs intake modulates these associations. We assessed whether dietary linoleic  (LA) or α- (ALA) modulate the association between the FADS1 rs174547 polymorphism (a GWAS hit) and lipid and anthropometric phenotypes.Dietary intakes of LA and ALA, FADS1 rs174547 genotypes, lipid and anthropometric variables were determined in three French population-based samples (n = 3069). These samples were stratified according to the median dietary LA (<9.5 and ≥9.5 g/d) and ALA (<0.80 and ≥0.80 g/d) intakes. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect.Our meta-analysis confirmed the association between rs174547 and plasma lipid levels and revealed an association with waist circumference and body mass index. These associations were not modified by dietary ALA intake (all p-interaction > 0.05). In contrast, the associations with HDL-cholesterol levels, waist circumference and BMI were modulated by the dietary intake of LA (p interaction < 0.05). In high LA consumers only, the rs174547 minor allele was significantly associated with lower HDL-cholesterol levels (β = -0.05 mmol/L, p = 0.0002). Furthermore, each copy of the rs174547 minor allele was associated with a 1.58 cm lower waist circumference (p = 0.0005) and a 0.46 kg m lower BMI (p = 0.01) in the low LA intake group, but not in the high LA intake group.The present study suggests that dietary LA intake may modulate the association between the FADS gene variants and HDL-cholesterol concentration, waist circumference and BMI. These gene-nutrient interactions, if confirmed, suggest that subjects carrying the rs174547 minor allele might benefit from low dietary LA intakes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

However, it has yet to be fully elucidated whether a serum PUFA profile is associated with hepatic steatosis.We aimed to clarify the relationship between a serum PUFA profile and liver lipid content.A cross-sectional study was conducted on 288 patients with dyslipidemia, diabetes, or coronary artery disease on statin therapy. Several PUFAs were measured, including eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), dihomo-γ- (DGLA) and arachidonic  (AA) in serum lipids, and Δ-5 desaturase (D5D) activity was estimated by AA to DGLA ratio. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) measured visceral fat area (VFA) and the ratio of CT attenuation for liver to spleen (L/S).The L/S ratio showed significant correlations with serum DGLA level and D5D activity (p<0.0001 for both). Serum DGLA level and D5D activity were significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI) or VFA, and with Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (p<0.0001 for all). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that a high DGLA level or low D5D activity was a significant determinant for hepatic steatosis (p<0.0001 for both) independent of BMI and HOMA-IR. ROC analysis revealed that they significantly enhanced the value of MetS-related factors in predicting hepatic steatosis (p<0.05 for both).A high DGLA level and low D5D activity in serum lipids may be useful markers predicting hepatic steatosis incrementally to MetS-related conventional factors.Copyright © 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of .

The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of different drying on retention of bioactive molecules, such as omega-3 fatty acids, total phenolic content and antiradical activity of purslane. Five different dehydration methods including microwave (100 MW, 5 min), tray, vacuum, low temperature low humidity, infrared were used at 55-60 °C for 5-7 h for dehydration of purslane. Three solvents, viz. water, ethanol and methanol were used for extraction of bioactive molecules from purslane. Total polyphenol content, antiradical activity and rehydration ratio of the bioactive molecules were determined. Results revealed that total PUFA, α- (ALA), total polyphenol content and antiradical activity were found to retain in the dried purslane in the range of (47.9-59.9 %), (42.5-50 %), (188-408GAE/100 g) and (33.0-88.8 mg/100 g) respectively. The highest values of ALA, total polyphenol content and antiradical activity were found to obtain in the vacuum dried sample. Rehydration ratio was found in the range of 3.2-4.3 and vacuum dried purslane showed maximum rehydration. It could be concluded that vacuum dehydration of purslane is an effective method for retention of bioactive molecules and good rehydration behaviour of dried purslane.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29652550>Chia Seed Supplementation Reduces Senescence Markers in Epididymal Adipose Tissue of High-Fat Diet-Fed SAMP8 Mice.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue is a key organ with substantial senescent cell accumulation under both  and aging conditions. Chia seed is an ancient seed and is the richest plant source of α-. We aimed to determine how cellular senescence markers will be altered in adipose tissue of senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice fed with high-fat diets (HFDs); and how chia seed can affect the above markers. SAMP8 mice and their control senescence-accelerated mouse-resistant 1 (SAMR1) were divided into four groups, that is, SAMR1 low-fat diet group (R1LF), SAMP8LF group (P8LF), SAMP8 high-fat group (P8HF), and SAMP8HF group supplemented with 10% chia seed (P8HC). At the end of the intervention, body composition was measured through T-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and epididymal (EPI) and subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissues were dissected for further analysis. Compared with the R1LF group, the P8HF and P8HC groups had significantly increased body fat mass. In EPI fat, p16, CD68 and PAI-1 mRNA expression from P8HF group were significantly increased; chia seed partially reduced p16 and CD68 mRNA expression. The P8LF group has increased p16 and CD68, and the P8HF group has increased p16, p21, and CD68; and P8HC group has increased p16 mRNA expression. The protein expression of p-AMPK in EPI and SC fat from the P8HF group was reduced. In conclusion, reductions in AMPK activity might be partially responsible for elevation in HFD-induced senescence markers in both EPI and SC fat, and chia seed supplementation is able to reduce senescence-associated markers at least in EPI adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27207550>Early Low-Fat Diet Enriched With  Reduces Liver Endocannabinoid Tone and Improves Late Glycemic Control After a High-Fat Diet Challenge in Mice.</a></h2><p>Evidence suggests that alterations of glucose and lipid homeostasis induced by  are associated with the elevation of endocannabinoid tone. The biosynthesis of the two main endocannabinoids, N-arachidonoylethanolamine and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol, which derive from arachidonic , is influenced by dietary fatty acids (FAs). We investigated whether exposure to n-3 FA at a young age may decrease tissue endocannabinoid levels and prevent metabolic disorders induced by a later high-fat diet (HFD) challenge. Three-week-old mice received a 5% lipid diet containing lard, lard plus safflower oil, or lard plus linseed oil for 10 weeks. Then, mice were challenged with a 30% lard diet for 10 additional weeks. A low n-6/n-3 FA ratio in the early diet induces a marked decrease in liver endocannabinoid levels. A similar reduction was observed in transgenic Fat-1 mice, which exhibit high tissue levels of n-3 FA compared with wild-type mice. Hepatic expression of key enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism was concomitantly changed. Interestingly, some gene modifications persisted after HFD challenge and were associated with improved glycemic control. These findings indicate that early dietary interventions based on n-3 FA may represent an alternative strategy to drugs for reducing endocannabinoid tone and improving metabolic parameters in the metabolic syndrome.© 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

In those born SGA, systolic blood pressure was 2.1 mm Hg lower ([95% CI 0.8-3.3]; P=.001) and pulse pressure 1.4 mm Hg lower ([95% CI 0.3-2.4]; P=.01), per exponential increase in  (ALA) intake; weakened by adjustment for anthropometric measures. Long-term ALA intake was inversely associated with aortic IMT at 19 years in those born SGA (-0.30 mm [95% CI -0.52, -0.08] per exponential greater ALA intake; P=.008), independent of other dietary and anthropometric factors.Long-term dietary ALA intake during childhood is associated with improved vascular health in people born SGA.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This could explain in part why the severe deficiency in omega-3 intake pointed by numerous epidemiologic studies may increase the brain's vulnerability representing an important risk factor in the development and/or deterioration of certain cardio- and neuropathologies. The roles of ALA in neurological disorders remain unclear, especially in stroke that is a leading cause of death. We and others have identified ALA as a potential nutraceutical to protect the brain from stroke, characterized by its pleiotropic effects in neuroprotection, vasodilation of brain arteries, and neuroplasticity. This review highlights how chronic administration of ALA protects against rodent models of hypoxic-ischemic injury and exerts an anti-depressant-like activity, effects that likely involve multiple mechanisms in brain, and may be applied in stroke prevention. One major effect may be through an increase in mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a widely expressed protein in brain that plays critical roles in neuronal maintenance, and learning and memory. Understanding the precise roles of ALA in neurological disorders will provide the underpinnings for the development of new therapies for patients and families who could be devastated by these disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29534257>Therapeutic Perspectives on Chia Seed and Its Oil: A Review.</a></h2><p>The attraction of novel foods proceeds alongside epidemic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, , and related risk factors. Dieticians have identified chia () as a product with a catalog of potential health benefits relating to these detriments. Chia is currently consumed not only as seeds, but also as oil, which brings about similar effects. Chia seeds and chia seed oil are used mainly as a food commodity and the oil is also used popularly as a dietary ingredient used in various dietary supplements available in the U. S. market. Chia seed is rich in -, the biological precursor to eicosapentaenoic , a polyunsaturated fatty , and docosahexaenoic . Because the body cannot synthesize -, chia has a newfound and instrumental role in diet. However, the inconclusive nature of the scientific community's understanding of its safety warrants further research and appropriate testing. The focus of this work is to summarize dietary health benefits of  seed and oil to acknowledge concerns of adverse events from its ingestion, to assess current research in the field, and to highlight the importance of quality compendial standards to support safe use. To achieve this end, a large-scale literature search was partaken on the two well-known databases, PubMed and SciFinder. Hundreds of articles detailing such benefits as decreased blood glucose, decreased waist circumference and weight in overweight adults, and improvements in pruritic skin and endurance in distance runners have been recorded. These benefits must be considered within the appropriate circumstances.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505767>The Effect of Maternal  on Breast Milk Fatty Acids and Its Association with Infant Growth and Cognition-The PREOBE Follow-Up.</a></h2><p>This study analyzed how maternal  affected fatty acids (FAs) in breast milk and their association with infant growth and cognition to raise awareness about the programming effect of maternal health and to promote a healthy prenatal weight. Mother-child pairs ( = 78) were grouped per maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI): normal-weight (BMI = 18.5-24.99), overweight (BMI = 25-29.99) and obese (BMI > 30). Colostrum and mature milk FAs were determined. Infant anthropometry at 6, 18 and 36 months of age and cognition at 18 were analyzed. Mature milk exhibited lower arachidonic  (AA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), among others, than colostrum. Breast milk of non-normal weight mothers presented increased saturated FAs and n6:n3 ratio and decreased α- (ALA), DHA and monounsaturated FAs. Infant BMI-for-age at 6 months of age was inversely associated with colostrum n6 (e.g., AA) and n3 (e.g., DHA) FAs and positively associated with n6:n3 ratio. Depending on the maternal weight, infant cognition was positively influenced by breast milk linoleic , n6 PUFAs, ALA, DHA and n3 LC-PUFAs, and negatively affected by n6:n3 ratio. In conclusion, this study shows that maternal pre-pregnancy BMI can influence breast milk FAs and infant growth and cognition, endorsing the importance of a healthy weight in future generations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889505> in maternal diet halts the lipid disarray due to saturated fatty acids in the liver of mice offspring at weaning.</a></h2><p> (ALA, 18:3) in maternal diets has been shown to attenuate  associated insulin resistance (IR) in adult offspring in mice. The objective in the present study was to detect the early effects of maternal dietary saturated fatty acids (SFA) and their partial substitution with ω-3 ALA, docosa hexenoic  (DHA,22:6) and eicosapentenoic  20:5 (EPA,20:5) on the HOMA index, liver lipids and fatty  desaturases in the offspring at weaning.3 month old C57Bl6/J female mice were fed diets containing normal amount of calories but rich in SFA alone or partially replaced with ALA, DHA or EPA before mating, during pregnancy and lactation.Pregnant mice fed SFA produced offspring with the highest HOMA index, liver lipids and desaturase activities. ALA prevented SFA induced lipid increase but DHA and EPA only reduced it by 42% and 31% respectively. ALA, DHA and EPA decreased HOMA index by 84%, 75% and 83% respectively. ALA, DHA and EPA decreased Δ6 and SCD1 desaturase activities about 30%.SFA feeding to mothers predisposes their offspring to develop IR and liver lipid accumulation already at weaning. ω3 fatty acids reduce IR, ALA halts lipid accumulation whereas DHA and EPA only blunt it.ALA and DHA restore the increased SCD1 to normal. These studies suggest that ω-3 fatty acids have different potencies to preclude lipid accumulation in the offspring partially by affecting pathways associated to SCD1 modulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877283>Increased Serum Dihomo-γ- Levels Are Associated with , Body Fat Accumulation, and Insulin Resistance in Japanese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Objective To clarify the associations between serum omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) levels and -related metabolic abnormalities in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods and Materials Data from 225 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were cross-sectionally analyzed. The serum levels of n-6 PUFAs [dihomo-γ- (DGLA) and arachidonic  (AA)] and n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic ) were measured, and the estimated Δ-5 desaturase (D5D) activity was calculated based on the AA to DGLA ratio. The associations between the composition of PUFAs and -related parameters, including the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, alanine amino transferase (ALT) level, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and body fat percentage, as measured by a bioelectrical impedance analysis, were analyzed. Results Among the PUFAs, the DGLA level had the strongest correlations with BMI (p<0.001), waist circumference (p<0.001), ALT level (p<0.001), HOMA-IR (p<0.001), and body fat percentage (p<0.01). AA was positively correlated and D5D was negatively correlated with several -related parameters, while n-3 PUFAs did not have a constant correlation. A multivariate regression analysis revealed that the DGLA level was an independent determinant for HOMA-IR (β=0.195, p=0.0066) after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, and the ALT, triglyceride, and HbA1c levels. Conclusion A high serum DGLA level was associated with , body fat accumulation, a high ALT level, and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes. The measurement of the serum PUFA levels may be useful for evaluating metabolic abnormalities and estimating the dietary habits of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258511>Association between increased visceral fat area and alterations in plasma fatty  profile in overweight subjects: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Visceral fat accumulation in overweight status has been resulted in changes of fatty  profiles. The fatty acids profiles can be altered by fatty  desaturase; the activity of which is highly associated with  and other metabolic diseases. We hypothesized that fatty  composition, desaturase activity, and accumulation of visceral fat are interrelated. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between increased visceral fat area and alterations in plasma fatty  profile in overweight subjects with different amounts of visceral fat.Healthy overweight subjects (25.0 kg/m ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m, n=232) were classified into lower (T1), middle (T2), and upper tertiles (T3) according to L4 visceral fat area (T1: <71.8 cm, T2: 71.8 cm-99.6 cm, T3: >99.6 cm).The T3 group showed higher amounts of cis-10-heptadecenoic  and activity of C16 Δ9-desaturase and C18 Δ9-desaturase and lower activity of Δ5-desaturase than the T1 group. Additionally, the T3 group showed higher amounts of saturated fatty acids, myristic , palmitic , stearic , monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , oleic , n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic , dihomo-γ-, arachidonic , n-3 PUFAs, and docosapentaenoic  than the T1 and T2 groups.This study indicates that greater than a certain area (>99.6 cm) of visceral fat is needed to observe altered levels of individual fatty  species and desaturase activities. The results suggest that increased activity of C16 Δ9-desaturase and C18 Δ9-desaturase in parallel with decreased Δ5-desaturase activity may be a causative factor in disturbed fatty  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29935107>Essential Fatty Acids Linoleic  and α- Sex-Dependently Regulate Glucose Homeostasis in .</a></h2><p>To assess the associations of dietary linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in a population-based cohort and further explore the mechanism of action in a high-fat-diet (HFD) induced obese (DIO) mouse model.The occurrence of T2D among 15 100 Chinese adults from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS, 1997-2011) were followed up for a median of 14 years. The relations of ALA and LA intakes with T2D risk were modified by BMI, with significant associations restricted to obese/overweight subjects. Among them, relative risks (95% confidence intervals) comparing extreme quartiles of intakes were 0.55 (0.32-0.93) in men and 0.53 (0.34-0.85) in women for ALA, while 0.71 (0.41-1.16) in men and 0.56 (0.36-0.89) in women for LA. DIO mice were fed with LA- or ALA-enriched HFD (0.2% wt wt ) for 15 weeks and then significant sex-dependent changes of gut microbiota were detected. Endotoxemia, systematic and adipose inflammation were relieved in ALA-fed male and LA-fed female mice.Long-term intake of LA (for women) and ALA may have a protective effect on T2D development for obese/overweight subjects through sex-specific gut microbiota modulation and gut-adipose axis.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) along with transcriptomics were applied on animal models to draw a mechanistic insight of NAFLD. Wild type (WT) and catalase knockout (CKO) mice were fed with normal fat diet (NFD) or high fat diet (HFD) to identify the changes in metabolic and transcriptomic profiles caused by catalase gene deletion in correspondence with HFD. Integrated omics analysis revealed that cholic  and 3β, 7α-dihydroxy-5-cholestenoate along with cyp7b1 gene involved in primary bile  biosynthesis were strongly affected by HFD. The analysis also showed that CKO significantly changed all-trans-5,6-epoxy-retinoic  or all-trans-4-hydroxy-retinoic  and all-trans-4-oxo-retinoic  along with cyp3a41b gene in retinol metabolism, and α/γ-, eicosapentaenoic  and thromboxane A2 along with ptgs1 and tbxas1 genes in  metabolism. Our results suggest that dysregulated primary bile  biosynthesis may contribute to liver steatohepatitis, while up-regulated retinol metabolism and  metabolism may have contributed to oxidative stress and inflammatory phenomena in our NAFLD model created using CKO mice fed with HFD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28675945>Impact of dietary fat on gut microbiota and low-grade systemic inflammation: mechanisms and clinical implications on .</a></h2><p>Dietary fat strongly affects human health by modulating gut microbiota composition and low-grade systemic inflammation. High-fat diets have been implicated in reduced gut microbiota richness, increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, and several changes at family, genus and species levels. Saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), polyunsaturated (PUFA) and conjugated  fatty acids share important pathways of immune system activation/inhibition with gut microbes, modulating obesogenic and proinflammatory profiles. Mechanisms that link dietary fat, gut microbiota and  are mediated by increased intestinal permeability, systemic endotoxemia, and the activity of the endocannabinoid system. Although the probiotic therapy could be a complementary strategy to improve gut microbiota composition, it did not show permanent effects to treat fat-induced dysbiosis. Based upon evidence to date, we believe that high-fat diets and SFA consumption should be avoided, and MUFA and omega-3 PUFA intake should be encouraged in order to regulate gut microbiota and inflammation, promoting body weight/fat control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25727966>Dietary unsaturated fatty acids differently affect catecholamine handling by adrenal chromaffin cells.</a></h2><p>Catecholamines (CA) play an important role in cardiovascular (CDV) disease risk. Namely, noradrenaline (NA) levels positively correlate whereas adrenaline (AD) levels negatively correlate with  and/or CDV disease. Western diets, which are tipically rich in Ω-6 fatty acids (FAs) and deficient in Ω-3 FAs, may contribute to the development of , type 2 diabetes and/or coronary artery disease. Taking this into consideration and the fact that our group has already described that saturated FAs affect catecholamine handling by adrenal chromaffin cells, this work aimed to investigate the effect of unsaturated FAs upon catecholamine handling in the same model. Our results showed that chronic exposure to unsaturated FAs differently modulated CA cellular content and release, regardless of both FA series and number of carbon atoms. Namely, the Ω-6 arachidonic and linoleic acids, based on their effect on CA release and cellular content, seemed to impair NA and AD vesicular transport, whereas γ- selectively impaired AD synthesis and release. Within the Ω-9 FAs, oleic  was devoid of effect, and elaidic  behaved similarly to γ-. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (Ω-3 series) impaired the synthesis and release of both NA and AD.

However, many of these compounds with in vitro activity fail to respond in vivo, probably due to the sophistication of the physiological energy regulatory networks. In this context, C. elegans has emerged as a plausible model for the identification and characterization of the effect of such compounds on fat storage in a complete organism. However, the results obtained in such a simple model are not easily extrapolated to more complex organisms such as mammals, which hinders its application in the short term. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain new experimental data about the evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms of fat loss between worms and mammals. Previously, we found that some omega-6 fatty acids promote fat loss in C. elegans by up-regulation of peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation in an omega-3 independent manner. In this work, we prove that the omega-6 fatty acids' effects on worms are also seen when they are supplemented with a natural omega-6 source (borage seed oil, BSO). Additionally, we explore the anti- effects of two doses of BSO in a diet-induced  rat model, validating the up-regulation of peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation. The supplementation with BSO significantly reduces body weight gain and energy efficiency and prevents white adipose tissue accumulation without affecting food intake. Moreover, BSO also increases serum HDL-cholesterol levels, improves insulin resistance and promotes the down-regulation of Cebpa, an adipogenesis-related gene. Therefore, we conclude that the effects of omega-6 fatty acids are highly conserved between worms and -induced mammals, so these compounds could be considered to treat or prevent -related disorders.</p></html>
