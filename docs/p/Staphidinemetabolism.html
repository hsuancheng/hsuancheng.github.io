In China, quite a few of Citrus are cultivated in acidic soils (pH < 5.0). 'Xuegan' (Citrus sinensis) and 'Sour pummelo' (Citrus grandis) (C. sinensis were more tolerant to low pH than C. grandis) seedlings were irrigated daily with nutrient solution at a pH of 2.5, 3 or 5 for nine months. Thereafter, we examined low pH effects on growth, and superoxide anion production rate (SAP), malondialdehyde (MDA), MG, antioxidants, and enzymes related to ROS and MG detoxification in roots and leaves in order to (a) test the hypothesis that low pH affected ROS and MG metabolisms more in roots than those of leaves, and (b) understand the roles of ROS and MG metabolisms in Citrus low pH-tolerance and -toxicity.Compared with control, most of the physiological parameters related to ROS and MG metabolisms were greatly altered at pH 2.5, but almost unaffected at pH 3. In addition to decreased root growth, many fibrous roots became rotten and died at pH 2.5. pH 2.5-induced changes in SAP, the levels of MDA, MG and antioxidants, and the activities of most enzymes related to ROS and MG metabolisms were greater in roots than those of leaves. Impairment of root ascorbate  was the most serious, especially in C. grandis roots. pH 2.5-induced increases in MDA and MG levels in roots and leaves, decreases in the ratios of ascorbate/(ascorbate+dehydroascorbate) in roots and leaves and of reduced glutathione/(reduced+oxidized glutathione) in roots were greater in C. grandis than those in C. sinensis.Low pH affected MG and ROS metabolisms more in roots than those in leaves. The most seriously impaired ascorbate  in roots was suggested to play a role in low pH-induced root death and growth inhibition. Low pH-treated C. sinensis roots and leaves had higher capacity to maintain a balance between ROS and MG production and their removal via detoxification systems than low pH-treated C. grandis ones, thus contribute to the higher acid-tolerance of C. sinensis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694237>Effects of Endurance and Endurance-Strength Training on Endothelial Function in Women with Obesity: A Randomized Trial.</a></h1><p>Some investigations have demonstrated that a combined endurance-strength training is the most effective in the treatment of obesity. The aim of the research was to access how different trainings influence: endothelial function, lipid , and risk of atherosclerosis in women with obesity. In a randomized trial, 39 obese women aged 28-62 completed endurance (n = 22, 60-80% HR) or combined training (n = 17, 20 minutes of strength exercises, 50-60% 1RM and 25 minutes of endurance training, 60-80% HR). Before and after the intervention vascular endothelial function (endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), blood total antioxidant capacity (TAC)), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides and C-reactive protein (CRP)as well as visceral adiposity index (VAI), total-body skeletal muscle mass and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) were determined. After the trainings, in both groups total cholesterol and total-body skeletal muscle mass increased ( < 0.05). In the group undergoing combined training, lower ( < 0.05) VAI, AIP, CRP and LDL-C were noted. In the group undergoing endurance training TBARS concentration decreased ( < 0.01), while the HDL-C ( < 0.01) concentration as well as eNOS ( < 0.05) activity increased. No significant differences between groups were found, either before or after the programs. Both training programs led to the improvement of lipid , but only endurance training alone favorably changed indicators of endothelial functions in women with obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695465>How Western Diet And Lifestyle Drive The Pandemic Of Obesity And Civilization Diseases.</a></h1><p>Westernized populations are plagued by a plethora of chronic non-infectious degenerative diseases, termed as "civilization diseases", like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease and many more, diseases which are rare or virtually absent in hunter-gatherers and other non-westernized populations. There is a growing awareness that the cause of this amazing discrepancy lies in the profound changes in diet and lifestyle during recent human history. This paper shows that the transition from Paleolithic nutrition to Western diets, along with lack of corresponding genetic adaptations, cause significant distortions of the fine-tuned  that has evolved over millions of years of human evolution in adaptation to Paleolithic diets. With the increasing spread of Western diet and lifestyle worldwide, overweight and civilization diseases are also rapidly increasing in developing countries. It is suggested that the diet-related key changes in the developmental process include an increased production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, development of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation and an abnormal activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, all of which play pivotal roles in the development of diseases of civilization. In addition, diet-related epigenetic changes and fetal programming play an important role. The suggested pathomechanism is also able to explain the well-known but not completely understood close relationship between obesity and the wide range of comorbidities, like type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, etc., as diseases of the same etiopathology. Changing our lifestyle in accordance with our genetic makeup, including diet and physical activity, may help prevent or limit the development of these diseases.© 2019 Kopp.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696597>Ghrelin receptor antagonism of fentanyl-induced conditioned place preference, intravenous self-administration, and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in rats.</a></h1><p>The extended occurrence of fentanils abuse associated with the dramatic increase in opioid fatal overdoses and dependence strongly emphasizes insufficiencies in opioid addiction treatment. Recently, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R1A) antagonism was proposed as a promising mechanism for drug addiction therapy. However, the role of GHS-R1A and its endogenous ligand ghrelin in opioid abuse is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of our study was to clarify whether the GHS-R1A antagonist JMV2959 could reduce the fentanyl-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), the fentanyl intravenous self-administration (IVSA), and the tendency to relapse, but also whether JMV2959 could significantly influence the fentanyl-induced dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens (NAC) in rats, that importantly participates in opioids' reinforcing effects. Following an ongoing fentanyl self-administration, JMV2959 3 mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally 20 minutes before three consequent daily 360-minute IVSA sessions under a fixed ratio FR1, which significantly reduced the number of active lever-pressing, the number of infusions, and the fentanyl intake. Pretreatment with JMV2959 also reduced the fentanyl-seeking/relapse-like behaviour tested in rats on the 12 day of the forced abstinence period. Pretreatment with JMV2959 significantly and dose-dependently reduced the manifestation of fentanyl-CPP. The fentanyl-CPP development was reduced after the simultaneous administration of JMV2959 with fentanyl during conditioning. The JMV2959 significantly reduced the accumbens dopamine release induced by subcutaneous and intravenous fentanyl. Simultaneously, it affected the concentration of byproducts associated with dopamine  in the NAC. Our findings suggest that GHS-R1A importantly participates in the rewarding/reinforcing effects of fentanyl.© 2019 Society for the Study of Addiction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691574>Nrf2 mediates oxidative stress-induced lipid accumulation in adipocytes by increasing adipogenesis and decreasing lipolysis.</a></h1><p>Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a regulator of cellular oxidative stress and is also involved in lipid  in adipocytes. However, it remains unknown whether Nrf2 is the link between oxidative stress and the induction of lipid accumulation in adipocytes.Here, we show that oxidative stress is markedly increased in white adipose tissue from mice with high-fat diet-induced or genetically (ob/ob)-induced obesity and from human subjects with obesity. Notably, in response to oxidative stress, Nrf2 expression and activity were induced, further promoting lipid accumulation in adipocytes and exacerbating the development of obesity. In contrast, Nrf2 ablation alleviated oxidative stress-induced lipid accumulation. Mechanistically, oxidative stress promoted Nrf2 recruitment to the SREBP-1 promoter, inducing target gene transcription and subsequent lipogenesis. Additionally, Nrf2 mediated oxidative stress-inhibited lipolysis in adipocytes via the PKA pathway. Innovation and Conclusion: Our data provide a novel insight that Nrf2, as a critical signaling node, links oxidative stress to the induction of fat accumulation in adipocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691951>The Virtually Mature BNP (BNP1-32) is a Precursor for the More Effective BNP1-30.</a></h1><p>The B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP1-32) exerts vasorelaxing and cardioprotective activity. BNP is used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of cardiopathological conditions and recombinant BNP1-32 as a drug for the treatment of such. BNP1-32 has a short half-life time and thus, similar to other vasoactive peptides like angiotensin II and bradykinin, can be enzymatically truncated forming bioactive metabolites. We aimed to investigate the  of BNP1-32 in mouse lung, to identify potential new BNP metabolites and to disclose their biological activity compared to the BNP1-32, in vitro and in vivo.Using High Performance Liquid Chromatography and Mass-Spectrometry, we identified a new BNP metabolite, BNP1-30, in the lung being generated by endothelin-converting enzyme-1.BNP1-30 is more efficient in stimulating the guanylyl cyclase receptor A (GC-A) and, in contrast to BNP1-32, is also able to profoundly stimulate the GC-B. In vivo, BNP1-30 reduced the mean arterial blood pressure of normotensive mice after acute infusion significantly more than BNP1-32. In a model of severe hypertension, a 3-day infusion of BNP1-30 was able to reduce systolic blood pressure by 30 mmHg and to improve markers of heart failure, while BNP1-32 was without significant effect.Our results suggest that BNP1-32 is the precursor for the biologically more active BNP1-30 leading to a fundamental extension of the natriuretic-peptide system. Due to expanded activity, BNP1-30 might be a promising treatment option for cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, its potency as a new diagnostic marker of specific cardiac diseases should be evaluated.This article is protected by copyright.

Of them, 29 had already experienced CVE prior to the inclusion in the study. We assessed the association between the elevation of the apoB/apoA1 ratio with the presence of CVE according to a logistic regression model for possible confounding factors. We also analysed the main parameters of activity of RA and parameters related to lipid . RA patients were classified according to treatment: patients treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs without biologics and those undergoing biologic therapy (anti-TNF-α, anti-IL-6 receptor, and other biologic agents).The apoB/apoA1 ratio of patients who had experienced CVE was higher than that of patients without previous CVE (0.65 vs. 0.60). However, the difference between both subgroups did not reach statistical significance (p=0.197). It was also the case after the multivariate analysis [OR: 1.48 (95% CI: 0.15-14.4); p=0.735]. RA patients from the group with CVE were more commonly receiving lipid-lowering treatment with statins than those without CVE history (41.4% vs. 20%, p=0.005). High HAQ and high atherogenic index were significantly associated with the presence of CVE. There was no statistical association between the type of biologic therapy used in RA and the presence of CVE.No association between ApoB/apoA1 ratio and CVE was found at the baseline visit of patients with RA from the CARMA study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691616>A rare enzymatic defect, true isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency leading to endocrine disorders and infertility: case report.</a></h1><p>The cytochrome P450 17A1 catalyzes the formation of 17-hydroxysteroids and 17-ketosteroid. Most defects in CYP17A1 impair both enzymatic activities and cause a combined 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, which impairs hormone production (cortisol and sex steroids), sexual development, and puberty. Isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency is usually defined by evidently normal activity of 17α-hydroxylase with a dramatic decline of 17,20-lyase activity or complete inactivity. The changes in enzyme activity lead to a lack in the production of sex steroids with normal levels of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones. A 24-years-old married woman, as a product of a consanguineous marriage, presented with infertility and a background marked by primary amenorrhea. Laboratory data showed low normal serum cortisol levels and low levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Also, her adrenal androgens were low but estradiol was normal. The chromosomal investigation uncovered a male karyotype of 46, XY.

These phenotypic traits are sustained even up to 45 °C, what makes it a relevant candidate for industrial biotechnology applications, such as ethanol production. It is therefore of much interest to get more insight into the  of this yeast. Recent studies suggested, that thermotolerance is achieved by reducing the number of growth-determining proteins or suppressing oxidative phosphorylation. Here we aimed to find related factors contributing to the thermotolerance of K. marxianus.Here, we reported the first genome-scale  model of Kluyveromyces marxianus, iSM996, using a publicly available Kluyveromyces lactis model as template. The model was manually curated and refined to include the missing species-specific  capabilities. The iSM996 model includes 1913 reactions, associated with 996 genes and 1531 metabolites. It performed well to predict the carbon source utilization and growth rates under different growth conditions. Moreover, the model was coupled with transcriptomics data and used to perform simulations at various growth temperatures.K. marxianus iSM996 represents a well-annotated  model of thermotolerant yeast, which provides a new insight into theoretical  profiles at different temperatures of K. marxianus.

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway plays a central role in  and energy homeostasis. Here, to investigate the role of AMPK in the protective effect of adiponectin against insulin resistance, we established the model of high-glucose (HG)- and high-lipid (HL)-induced insulin resistance in INS-1 pancreatic β cells. We found that 25mM of glucose and 0.4mM of palmitic acid treatment significantly increased cell apoptosis and impaired insulin secretion in INS-1 cells. However, recombinant human adiponectin dramatically reduced HG- and/or HL-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion. Interestingly, adiponectin treatment also activated AMPK signalling pathway by increasing the phosphorylation of Thr172 in the AMPK α subunit; 10μM of compound C, a potent AMPK inhibitor, blocked the protective effects of adiponectin against HG/HL-induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, knockout experiments by CRISPR/Cas9 technology showed that AMPK α1, but not AMPK α2, is involved in the protective effects of adiponectin. Taken together, adiponectin reversed the effects of insulin resistance via AMPK α1, which provides a novel insight into the protective mechanism of adiponectin and may be used as a new strategy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Adiponectin can reverse the effects of insulin resistance and lower blood glucose levels. Here, adiponectin reduced HG/HL-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion. These effects were blocked by AMPK inhibitor, compound C. Specifically, we found that AMPK α1, but not AMPK α2, mediates the protective effects of adiponectin, which provides a novel insight into the protective mechanism of adiponectin against insulin resistance.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693215>Cytosolic phospholipase A and F isoprostanes are involved in semen quality and human infertility-A study on leucocytospermia, varicocele and idiopathic infertility.</a></h1><p>Phospholipase A (PLA ) is involved in eicosanoid release, and F -isoprostanes (F -IsoPs), as free radical-generated eicosanoids released by PLA , are indicators of oxidative stress in different human conditions. This study investigated the interplay between cytosolic PLA (cPLA ), F -IsoPs and sperm features in male infertility, when the involvement of oxidative stress has been reported. Semen evaluation was performed following WHO guidelines, sperm ultrastructure was detected by transmission electron microscopy indicating a fertility index, and the percentages of sperm immaturity, apoptosis and necrosis. In sperm cells and seminal plasma, cPLA levels were determined by immunological method, whereas F -IsoPs by mass spectrometry. Sperm concentration, morphology, vitality and fertility index values were significantly lower in infertile groups compared with fertile men. An increase in sperm apoptosis and necrosis (p < .01), apoptosis (p < .01) and immaturity (p < .001) was detected in leucocytospermia, idiopathic infertility and varicocele, respectively. Seminal cPLA showed the highest value in varicocele group (p < .05), whereas seminal F -IsoPs increased in varicocele (p < .001) and leucocytospermia (p < .05) groups. In the whole population, F -IsoP and cPLA levels were positively correlated (p < .05). On the contrary, F -IsoPs and cPLA were not significantly different when investigated in sperm cells.

Although studies in the last decade had uncovered the signaling  involved in bone formation stimulation, preventative of the onset and more efficient therapeutic strategies for the treatment of osteoporosis remain an important unmet clinical need. MicroRNAs were reported to play an important role in maintaining bone development and . We investigated the effect of miR-23a-3p on the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast isolated from the tibia bone tissue of osteoporosis rats. Eighty Wistar female rats were divided into osteoporosis model group and normal group. Tibia bone tissues and osteoblasts were isolated for the following experiments. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction illustrated that miR-23a-3p expression was significantly increased, while PGC-1α/WNT/β-catenin signaling related proteins were significantly inhibited in tibia bone tissues of osteoporosis rat compared with normal control rat. MiR-23a-3p inhibited PGC-1α expression and suppressed the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway via directly targeting PGC-1α. Furthermore, suppression of miR-23a-3p increased cell viability and cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis in primary osteoblast, and promoted alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium nodules by targeting PGC-1α/WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our study revealed that inhibition of miR-23a-3p promoted the osteoblasts proliferation and differentiation through targeting PGC-1α/WNT/β-catenin signaling in osteoporosis rats.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694787>Positron emission tomography in ischemic heart disease.</a></h1><p>Non-invasive assessment of ischemic heart disease remains a challenging task, even with a large armory of diagnostic modalities. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an advanced radionuclide technique that has been available for decades. Originally used as a research tool that contributed to advances in the understanding of cardiovascular pathophysiology, it is now becoming established in clinical practice and is increasingly used in the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with ischemic heart disease. PET myocardial perfusion imaging has a mean sensitivity and specificity of around 90% for the detection of angiographically significant coronary artery disease, and is also highly accurate for assessing the prognosis of patients with ischemic heart disease. Depending on the radiotracer used, it can provide information not only on myocardial perfusion but also on myocardial , which is essential for viability assessment. The potential of this imaging technique has been further increased with the introduction of hybrid scanners, which combine PET with computed tomography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, offering integrated morphological and functional information and hence comprehensive assessment of the effects of atherosclerosis on the myocardium. The scope of this review is to summarize the role of PET in ischemic heart disease.Copyright © 2019 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia. Publicado por Elsevier España, S.L.U.

Early and non-invasive diagnosis of these diffuse hepatopathies calls for possible imaging markers. The purpose of this study was to explore the changes in global hepatic glucose  following hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, or cirrhosis on F-2-fluoro-2-D-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (F-FDG PET)/computed tomography (CT).A total of 178 subjects (51 healthy controls, 41 patients with hepatic steatosis, 50 patients with chronic hepatitis, and 36 patients with hepatic cirrhosis) were recruited, and their hepatic F-FDG PET/CT images were reviewed retrospectively. The hepatic volume (HV; cm), mean standardized uptake value (SUV) in the global liver, and accordingly, global hepatic glycolysis (GHG; cm) were measured. SPSS 19.0 was used for statistical analysis with ANOVA and LSD t-tests, and p <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Statistical differences were observed in SUV among the hepatic steatosis group (2.44 ± 0.40), hepatitis group (2.47 ±0 .37), control group (2.23 ± 0.42), and hepatic cirrhosis group (2.01 ± 0.36) except between the steatosis group and hepatitis group.

An assessment of the evidence.</a></h1><p>As a major metabolite of kynurenine in the oxidative  of tryptophan, kynurenic acid is of considerable biological and clinical importance as an endogenous antagonist of glutamate in the central nervous system. It is most active as an antagonist at receptors sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) which regulate neuronal excitability and plasticity, brain development and behaviour. It is also thought to play a causative role in hypo-glutamatergic conditions such as schizophrenia, and a protective role in several neurodegenerative disorders, notably Huntington's disease. An additional hypothesis, that kynurenic acid could block nicotinic receptors for acetylcholine in the CNS has been proposed as an alternative mechanism of action of kynurenate. However, the evidence for this alternative mechanism is highly controversial, partly because at least 8 earlier studies concluded that kynurenic acid blocked NMDA receptors but not nicotinic receptors and 5 subsequent, independent studies designed to repeat the results have failed to do so. Many studies considered to support the alternative 'nicotinic' hypothesis have been based on the use of analogs of kynurenate such as 7-chloro-kynurenic acid, or putatively nicotinic modulators such as galantamine, but a detailed analysis of the pharmacology of these compounds suggests that the results have often been mis-interpreted, especially since the pharmacology of galantamine itself has been disputed. This review examines the evidence in detail, with the conclusion that there is no confirmed, reliable evidence for an antagonist activity of kynurenic acid at nicotinic receptors. Therefore, since there is overwhelming evidence for kynurenate acting at inotropic glutamate receptors, especially NMDAR glutamate and glycine sites, with some activity at GPR35 sites and Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptors, results with kynurenic acid should be interpreted only in terms of these confirmed sites of action.© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692282>Excess postexercise oxygen consumption decreases with swimming duration in a labriform fish: Integrating aerobic and anaerobic  across time.</a></h1><p>Many vertebrate animals employ anaerobic  during high-speed exercise, even if it imposes an energetic cost during postexercise recovery, expressed as excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). In ectotherms such a fish, the initial anaerobic contribution to exercise is often substantial. Even so, fish may recover from anaerobic  as swimming exercise ensues and aerobic  stabilizes, thus total energetic costs of exercise could depend on swimming duration and subsequent physiological recovery. To test this hypothesis, we examined EPOC in striped surfperch (Embiotoca lateralis) that swam at high speeds (3.25 L s ) during randomly ordered 2-, 5-, 10-, and 20-min exercise periods. We found that EPOC was highest after the 2-min period (20.9 mg O  kg ) and lowest after the 20-min period (13.6 mg O  kg ), indicating that recovery from anaerobic  improved with exercise duration. Remarkably, EPOC for the 2-min period accounted for 72% of the total O consumption, whereas EPOC for the 20-min period only accounted for 14%. Thus, the data revealed a striking decline in the total cost of transport from 0.772 to 0.226 mg O ·kg ·m during 2- and 20-min periods, respectively. Our study is the first to combine anaerobic and aerobic swimming costs to demonstrate an effect of swimming duration on EPOC in fish.

Upregulation of cellular oxidant detoxification, and GSH- NADH-  accompanied with downregulation of protein folding, energy , and heat stress responses were observed in the UV group. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) predicted suppression of oxidative phosphorylation (validated by western blotting: WB) along with augmentation in OS and mitochondrial dysfunction in UV.

HIF-1A as an upstream regulator of HSPs was predicted by Metacore. Occurrence of reductive stress in UV spermatozoa was corroborated by thiol redox status.This is the first evidence of a novel pathway showing aberrant redox homeostasis against chronic hypoxic insult in varicocele leading to sperm dysfunction.Upregulation of antioxidant system and dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation would have shifted the redox balance of biological redox couples (GSH/GSSG, NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH and NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH) to a more reducing state leading to reductive stress. Chronic reductive stress-induced OS may be involved in sperm dysfunction in infertile men with UV where the role of HSPs cannot be ignored.

Effects of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-18 on HLMVEC adhesiveness to the human monocyte cell line THP-1, adhesion molecule expression, endothelial barrier function and activation of P38MAPK were investigated in vitro. Stable  silencing in HLMVECs resulted in impaired endothelial barrier function and constitutive activation of P38MAPK.

In -silenced HLMVECs, cytokines enhanced adhesiveness capacities, activation of P38MAPK and impaired endothelial barrier function suggesting that cytokines could trigger the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension in a context of impaired BMPRII signaling pathway.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694194>The Alanine World Model for the Development of the Amino Acid Repertoire in Protein Biosynthesis.</a></h1><p>A central question in the evolution of the modern translation machinery is the origin and chemical ethology of the amino acids prescribed by the genetic code. The RNA World hypothesis postulates that templated protein synthesis has emerged in the transition from RNA to the Protein World. The sequence of these events and principles behind the acquisition of amino acids to this process remain elusive. Here we describe a model for this process by following the scheme previously proposed by Hartman and Smith, which suggests gradual expansion of the coding space as GC-GCA-GCAU genetic code. We point out a correlation of this scheme with the hierarchy of the protein folding. The model follows the sequence of steps in the process of the amino acid recruitment and fits well with the co-evolution and coenzyme handle theories. While the starting set (GC-phase) was responsible for the nucleotide biosynthesis processes, in the second phase alanine-based amino acids (GCA-phase) were recruited from the core , thereby providing a standard secondary structure, the α-helix. In the final phase (GCAU-phase), the amino acids were appended to the already existing architecture, enabling tertiary fold and membrane interactions. The whole scheme indicates strongly that the choice for the alanine core was done at the GCA-phase, while glycine and proline remained rudiments from the GC-phase. We suggest that the Protein World should rather be considered the Alanine World, as it predominantly relies on the alanine as the core chemical scaffold.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696620>Energy flux controls tetraether lipid cyclization in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius.</a></h1><p>Microorganisms regulate the composition of their membranes in response to environmental cues. Many Archaea maintain the fluidity and permeability of their membranes by adjusting the number of cyclic moieties within the cores of their glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids. Cyclized GDGTs increase membrane packing and stability, which has been shown to help cells survive shifts in temperature and pH. However, the extent of this cyclization also varies with growth phase and electron acceptor or donor limitation. These observations indicate a relationship between energy  and membrane composition. Here we show that the average degree of GDGT cyclization increases with doubling time in continuous cultures of the thermoacidophile Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (DSM 639). This is consistent with the behavior of a mesoneutrophile, Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1. Together, these results demonstrate that archaeal GDGT distributions can shift in response to electron donor flux and energy availability, independent of pH or temperature. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on GDGTs thus capture the energy available to microbes, which encompasses fluctuations in temperature and pH, as well as electron donor and acceptor availability. The ability of Archaea to adjust membrane composition and packing may be an important strategy that enables survival during episodes of energy stress. This article is protected by copyright.

Indeed, unsaturated fatty acids act as precursors of bioactive molecules such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, resolvins and related compounds. As components of phospholipids, they have a pivotal role in cell biology by regulating membrane fluidity and membrane-associated cellular processes. Finally, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are also endowed with ligand properties for numerous membrane or nuclear receptors. Although myeloid cells are dependent on the  context for the uptake of essential FAs, recent studies showed that these cells autonomously handle the synthesis of n-3 and n-6 long chain PUFAs such as arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. Moreover, targeting PUFA  in macrophages influences pathological processes, including atherosclerosis, by modulating macrophage functions. Omics evidence also supports a role for macrophage PUFA  in the development of cardiometabolic diseases in humans. Currently, there is a renewed interest in the role of n-3/n-6 PUFAs and their oxygenated derivatives in the onset of atherosclerosis and plaque rupture. Purified n-3 FA supplementation appears as a potential strategy in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. In this context, the ability of immune cells to handle and to synthesize very long chain PUFA must absolutely be integrated and better understood.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

CYP24A1 is the key enzyme for  inactivation of active VD (1,25(OH)D). We examined whether common germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP24A1 gene could affect the association between adult weight gain and breast cancer (BC) risk.The population-based case-control study included 818 patients with primary BC and 935 residence and age matched healthy controls. We studied the relationships between CYP24A1 gene SNPs (rs2209314, rs2585428, rs2762941, rs3787555, rs4809959, rs73913757, rs912505, and rs927a650), adult weight change and BC risk. Gene-weight change interactions were analyzed.Neither of CYP24A1 gene SNPs was associated with BC risk in the study participants. However, we found consistent gene-weight interactions with increasing adult weight gain for CYP24A1-rs2762941 (P-interaction = 0.0089) and CYP24A1-rs927650 (P-interaction = 0.0283). Adult weight gain has a higher premenopausal BC risk with double variant T alleles of rs927650 compared to women carrying at least one wild-type C allele (OR for TT = 1.82, 95% CI 1.10-3.01; for CT = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.14; for CC = 1.12 95% CI 0.93-1.35). Women with double wild-type A alleles were at a higher postmenopausal BC risk compared to those carrying at least one variant-type G allele (OR for AA = 1.51, 95% CI 1.29-1.76; for AG = 1.13, 95% CI 0.98-1.30; for GG = 1.22 95% CI 0.95-1.57). When stratified by CYP24A1 SNPs genotypes, weight gain in adulthood increased postmenopausal BC risk of women with homozygous allele compared to women with heterozygotes allele.Significant interactions of weight change with CYP24A1 polymorphisms suggest CYP24A1 as a potential link between weight change and BC risk and the possibility that the impact of adult weight gain on postmenopausal BC risk may be enhanced by homozygous alleles of CYP24A1 SNPs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692244>Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as add-on to insulin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.</a></h1><p>To assess the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as add-on to insulin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).This multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study randomised Japanese patients with T2D insufficiently controlled with insulin (1:1:1) to empagliflozin 10 mg (n=89), empagliflozin 25 mg (n=90) or placebo (n=90) for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline at 16 weeks.At 16 weeks, empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg significantly decreased HbA1c (adjusted mean difference, -0.92% [95% CI -1.11, -0.73] and -1.00% [-1.18, -0.82]; both p<0.0001) compared with placebo. This difference was maintained up to 52 weeks (adjusted mean difference at 52 weeks, -0.90% [-1.09, -0.70] and -0.96% [-1.15, -0.77]; both p<0.0001). At 52 weeks, significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose (adjusted mean difference, -27.62 mg/dL [-36.15, -19.08] and -31.99 mg/dL [-40.35, -23.62]) and body weight (-1.78 kg [-2.46, -1.10] and -1.92 kg [-2.58, -1.25]) were also seen with empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg compared with placebo (all p<0.0001). At 52 weeks, the frequency of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were similar between treatment groups; confirmed hypoglycaemia was reported slightly more in empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg patients (23.3% and 22.2% vs 14.4%). All hypoglycaemic events were mild in severity; no episodes required assistance.In Japanese patients with insufficiently controlled T2D, adding empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg to insulin treatment was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c at 16 weeks and was generally well tolerated.

The study was conducted at public schools in Londrina, Paraná, in 2011.Habitual physical activity, sports participation during childhood, parental physical activity, socioeconomic status and perception of social relationships were self-reported. Cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated via a 20-m shuttle-run test and somatic maturation was estimated from the age at peak height velocity.Our results provided evidence that girls (physical activity: odds ratio, OR: 4.37 [95% confidence interval, CI: 1.86-10.3]; sports: OR: 2.65 [95% CI: 1.39-5.05]) and adolescents with low cardiorespiratory fitness (physical activity: OR: 1.77 [95% CI: 1.13-2.78]; sports: OR: 1.62 [95% CI: 1.15-2.26]) were more likely to drop out from active behaviors. Children with inactive mothers and inactive fathers (OR: 3.55 [95% CI: 1.12-11.3]) also showed a higher dropout rate from physical activity. Adolescents with negative perceptions of friendships (OR: 2.33 [95% CI: 1.21-4.47]) were more likely to drop out from sports.Higher dropout rates from active lifestyles during childhood were observed among girls and adolescents with low cardiorespiratory fitness.

Although high salt intake is a proposed risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, the relationship between AD and high salt intake has not been clarified. We examined the effect of high-salt challenge on a mouse AD model. Approach and Results: AD was induced in male mice by continuous infusion of β-aminopropionitrile and Ang II (angiotensin II). High-salt challenge exacerbated aortic wall destruction in AD. Deletion of  (IL-17KO [IL (interleukin)-17A knockout]) did not affect the AD phenotype at baseline, but it abolished the high salt-induced worsening of the aortic destruction. Unexpectedly, aortas of IL-17KO mice exhibited global changes in ECM (extracellular matrix)-related genes without alteration of proinflammatory genes, altered architecture of collagen fibers, and reduced stiffness before AD induction. The aortas of IL-17KO mice were less sensitive to AD-inducing stimuli, as shown by the induction of phenotypic modulation markers SMemb and vimentin, suggesting a reduced stress response. The aortas of IL-17KO mice had a higher population of smooth muscle cells with nuclear-localized phosphorylated Smad2, indicative of TGFβ (transforming growth factor-beta) signal activation. Consistently, pretreatment of smooth muscle cells in culture with IL-17A blunted the activation of Smad2 by TGFβ1.These findings indicate that high salt intake has a worsening effect on AD in the context of high aortic wall stiffness, which is under the control of IL-17A through ECM . Therefore, salt restriction may represent a low-cost and practical way to reduce AD risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692085>Articular cartilage degradation and aberrant subchondral bone remodeling in patients with osteoarthritis and osteoporosis.</a></h1><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) and osteoporosis (OP) are two skeletal disorders associated with joint structures. Occasionally, OA and OP occur in the same patient. However, the effect of OP changes on OA progression in patients with osteoporotic OA (OP-OA) has not been reported, especially the potential association between subchondral bone and articular cartilage. Thus we investigated the alterations in the microstructure, biomechanical properties, and remodeling of subchondral bone as well as their association with cartilage damage in the hip joint of patients with OP-OA. Thirty-nine femoral head specimens were obtained from patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty (OA group, n=19; OP-OA group, n=20), and healthy specimens from cadaver donors were used (control group, n=10). The microstructure and biomechanical properties of subchondral bone were evaluated by micro-computed tomography and micro-finite-element analysis. Histology, histomorphometric measurements and immunohistochemistry were used to assess subchondral bone remodeling and cartilage damage. Linear regression analysis was performed to elucidate the relationship between subchondral bone and articular cartilage. In the subchondral bone of the OP-OA group, compared with that of the OA group, aberrant bone remodeling leads to an inferior microstructure and worsening biomechanical properties, potentially affecting transmission of loading stress from the cartilage to the subchondral bone, and then resulting in accelerated OA progression in patients with OP-OA. The results indicate that changes in subchondral bone could affect OA development and the improvement in subchondral bone with bone- agents may help mitigate OA progression when OP and OA co-exist in the same patients.

Coffee contains caffeine, a known neuromodulator that acts as an adenosine receptor antagonist, as well as other components, such as chlorogenic acids, trigonelline, cafestol and kahweol. Thus, this review discusses the up-to-date knowledge of mechanisms of action of coffee and its bioactive compounds on lipid . Although there is evidence that coffee and/or its bioactive compounds regulate transcription factors (e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and sterol regulatory element binding proteins) and enzymes (e.g. AMP-activated protein kinase) involved in lipogenesis, lipid uptake, transport, fatty acid β-oxidation and/or lipolysis, needs for the understanding of coffee and its effects on lipid  in humans remain to be answered.© The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694152>Acute Ingestion of a Mixed Flavonoid and Caffeine Supplement Increases Energy Expenditure and Fat Oxidation in Adult Women: A Randomized, Crossover Clinical Trial.</a></h1><p>This randomized, double-blinded, crossover study measured the acute effect of ingesting a mixed flavonoid-caffeine (MFC) supplement compared to placebo (PL) on energy expenditure (EE) and fat oxidation (FATox) in a  chamber with premenopausal women ( = 19, mean ± SD, age 30.7 ± 8.0 year, BMI 25.7 ± 3.4 kg/m). The MFC supplement (658 mg flavonoids, split dose 8:30, 13:00) contained quercetin, green tea catechins, and anthocyanins from bilberry extract, and 214 mg caffeine. Participants were measured twice in a  chamber for a day, four weeks apart, with outcomes including 22 h EE (8:30-6:30), substrate utilization from the respiratory quotient (RQ), plasma caffeine levels (16:00), and genotyping for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs762551. Areas under the curve (AUC) for  data from the MFC and PL trials were calculated using the trapezoid rule, with a mixed linear model (GLM) used to evaluate the overall treatment effect. The 22 h oxygen consumption and EE were significantly higher with MFC than PL (1582 ± 143, 1535 ± 154 kcal/day, respectively,  = 0.003, trial difference of 46.4 ± 57.8 kcal/day). FATox trended higher for MFC when evaluated using GLM (99.2 ± 14.0, 92.4 ± 14.4 g/22 h,  = 0.054). Plasma caffeine levels were significantly higher in the MFC versus PL trial (5031 ± 289, 276 ± 323 ng/mL, respectively,  < 0.001). Trial differences for 22 h EE and plasma caffeine were unrelated after controlling for age and body mass ( = -0.249,  = 0.139), and not different for participants with the homozygous allele 1, A/A, compared to C/A and C/C ( = 0.50 and 0.56, respectively). In conclusion, EE was higher for MFC compared to PL, and similar to effects estimated from previous trials using caffeine alone. A small effect of the MFC on FATox was measured, in contrast to inconsistent findings previously reported for this caffeine dose. The trial variance for 22 h EE was not significantly related to the variance in plasma caffeine levels or CYP1A2*1F allele carriers and non-carriers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696157>Insulin Resistance and Serum Magnesium Concentrations among Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects ∼1 in 10 women worldwide. Hypomagnesemia may worsen insulin resistance (IR) due to the role magnesium (Mg) plays in glucose . This review explores the relation between serum Mg and IR among women with PCOS. A review of primary research focusing on both serum Mg and women with PCOS was conducted from 2011 to 2019. Studies reviewed included human subjects, written in the English language, and limited to community-dwelling women aged ≥18 y. A total of 7 articles were reviewed. The findings from 4 epidemiological analytic studies evaluating serum Mg status suggest there may be a relation between serum Mg concentrations and IR among women with PCOS. However, among the 3 experimental trials, Mg supplementation inconsistently impacted IR among women with PCOS. Women with PCOS are more likely to underconsume Mg-rich foods and have a greater likelihood of lower serum Mg concentrations. Although it remains unclear if dietary Mg and/or supplementation should be a nutritional strategy for all women with PCOS, current research indicates an association between adequate Mg status and improved IR. Further research evaluating dietary interventions and supplementation is warranted.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691189>Ionizing Radiation Exacerbates the Bone Loss Induced by Iron Overload in Mice.</a></h1><p>Patients with radiotherapy are at significant risks of bone loss and fracture. On the other hand, osteoporosis often occurs in disorders characterized by iron overload. Either ionizing radiation (IR) or iron overload alone has detrimental effects on bone , but their combined effects are not well defined. In this study, we evaluated the effects of IR on bone loss in an iron-overload mouse model induced by intraperitoneal injection of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC). In the present study, we found that IR additively aggravated iron overload induced by FAC injections. Iron overload stimulated hepcidin synthesis, while IR had an inhibitory effect and even inhibited the stimulatory effects of iron overload. Micro-CT analysis demonstrated that the loss of bone mineral density and bone volume, and the deterioration of bone microarchitecture were greatest in combined treatment group. Iron altered the responses of bone cells to IR. Iron enhanced the responses of osteoclasts to IR with elevated osteoclast differentiation, but did not affect osteoblast differentiation. Our study indicates that IR and iron in combination lead to a more severe impact on the bone homeostasis when compared with their respective effects. IR aggravated iron overload induced bone loss by heightened bone resorption relative to formation. The addictive effects may be associated with the exacerbated iron accumulation and osteoclast differentiation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694542>The role of nitric oxide during embryonic wound healing.</a></h1><p>The study of the mechanisms controlling wound healing is an attractive area within the field of biology, with it having a potentially significant impact on the health sector given the current medical burden associated with healing in the elderly population. Healing is a complex process and includes many steps that are regulated by coding and noncoding RNAs, proteins and other molecules. Nitric oxide (NO) is one of these small molecule regulators and its function has already been associated with inflammation and angiogenesis during adult healing.Our results showed that NO is also an essential component during embryonic scarless healing and acts via a previously unknown mechanism. NO is mainly produced during the early phase of healing and it is crucial for the expression of genes associated with healing. However, we also observed a late phase of healing, which occurs for several hours after wound closure and takes place under the epidermis and includes tissue remodelling that is dependent on NO. We also found that the NO is associated with multiple cellular  , in particularly the glucose  pathway. This is particular noteworthy as the use of NO donors have already been found to be beneficial for the treatment of chronic healing defects (including those associated with diabetes) and it is possible that its mechanism of action follows those observed during embryonic wound healing.Our study describes a new role of NO during healing, which may potentially translate to improved therapeutic treatments, especially for individual suffering with problematic healing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690730>Metformin induces lipid changes on sphingolipid species and oxidized lipids in polycystic ovary syndrome women.</a></h1><p>Metformin is one of the treatments used for PCOS pathology decreasing body weight, plasma androgen, FSH and glucose levels. Unfortunately, there is little known about metformin's effects on lipid , a crucial process in PCOS pathology. We have employed a lipidomic approach to explore alterations in the plasma lipid profile of patients with PCOS following metformin treatment. The aim is to offer new insights about the effect of metformin in PCOS patients. Plasma samples were obtained from 27 subjects prior to and following 12 weeks of metformin treatment. A detailed biochemical characterization and lipidomic profile was performed. Metformin reduces BMI, HOMA-IR, FSH and androstenedione and increases DHEA-S but no changes were found in glucose levels after treatment. Multivariate statistics revealed a specific lipidomic signature due to the effect of 12 weeks of metformin treatment in PCOS patients. This signature includes changes in sphingolipid  suggesting a crosstalk between these lipid species and the androgenic  and a decrease in oxidized lipids reinforcing that metformin treatment improves oxidative stress status. Our study confirms the specific effect of metformin in lipid  on women with PCOS after 12 weeks of treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695851>Graphene quantum dots rescue protein dysregulation of pancreatic β-cells exposed to human islet amyloid polypeptide.</a></h1><p>The amyloid aggregation of peptides and proteins is a hallmark of neurological disorders and type 2 diabetes. Human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic β-cells, plays dual roles in both glycemic control and the pathology of type 2 diabetes. While IAPP can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and modulate cellular autophagy, apoptosis and extracellular matrix , no data is available concerning intracellular protein expression upon exposure to the polypeptide. More surprisingly, how intracellular protein expression is modulated by nanoparticle inhibitors of protein aggregation remains entirely unknown. In this study, we first examined the changing proteomes of βTC6, a pancreatic β-cell line, upon exposure to monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar IAPP, and detailed cellular protein expression rescued by graphene quantum dots (GQDs), an IAPP inhibitor. We found that 29 proteins were significantly dysregulated by the IAPP species, while majority of these proteins were nucleotide-binding proteins. Collectively, our liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry, fluorescence quenching, helium ion microscopy, cytotoxicity and discreet molecular dynamics simulations data revealed a remarkable capacity of GQDs in regulating aberrant protein expression through H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions, pointing to nanomedicine as a new frontier against human amyloid diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693171>A new mechanism for Cannabidiol in regulating the one-carbon cycle and methionine levels in Dictyostelium and in mammalian epilepsy models.</a></h1><p>Background and Purpose Epidiolex , a form of highly purified cannabidiol (CBD) derived from Cannabis plants has demonstrated seizure control activity in patients with Dravet syndrome, without a fully-elucidated mechanism of action. We have employed an unbiased approach to investigate this mechanism at a cellular level. Experimental Approach We use a tractable biomedical model organism, Dictyostelium, to identify protein controlling the effect of CBD and characterize this mechanism. We then translate these results to a Dravet Syndrome mouse model and an acute in vitro seizure model. Key Results CBD activity is partially dependent upon the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system component, GcvH1 in Dictyostelium, orthologous to the human GCSH protein, which is functionally linked to folate one-carbon  (FOCM). Analysis of FOCM components identified a mechanism for CBD in directly inhibiting methionine synthesis. Analysis of brain tissue from a Dravet syndrome mouse model also showed drastically altered levels of one-carbon components including methionine, and an in vitro rat seizure model showed an elevated level of methionine that is attenuated following CBD treatment. Conclusions and Implications Our results suggest a novel mechanism for CBD in the regulating methionine levels, and identify altered one-carbon  in Dravet syndrome and seizure activity.This article is protected by copyright.

Recently, a large number of high-quality transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets for apple were made available to the public, which could be helpful in inferring gene regulatory relationships and thus predicting gene function at the genome level. Through integration of the available apple genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic datasets, we constructed co-expression , identified functional modules, and predicted chromatin states. A total of 112 RNA-seq datasets were integrated to construct a global network and a conditional network (tissue-preferential network). Furthermore, a total of 1,076 functional modules with closely related gene sets were identified to assess the modularity of biological  and further subjected to functional enrichment analysis. The results showed that the function of many modules was related to development, secondary , hormone response, and transcriptional regulation. Transcriptional regulation is closely related to epigenetic marks on chromatin. A total of 20 epigenomic datasets, which included ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and DNA methylation analysis datasets, were integrated and used to classify chromatin states. Based on the ChromHMM algorithm, the genome was divided into 620,122 fragments, which were classified into 24 states according to the combination of epigenetic marks and enriched-feature regions. Finally, through the collaborative analysis of different omics datasets, the online database AppleMDO (http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/AppleMDO/) was established for cross-referencing and the exploration of possible novel functions of apple genes. In addition, gene annotation information and functional support toolkits were also provided. Our database might be convenient for researchers to develop insights into the function of genes related to important agronomic traits and might serve as a reference for other fruit trees.Copyright © 2019 Da, Liu, Yang, Tian, She, Ma, Xu and Su.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696578>Analysis of the CodY RNome reveals RsaD as a stress-responsive riboregulator of overflow  in Staphylococcus aureus.</a></h1><p>In Staphylococcus aureus, the transcription factor CodY modulates the expression of hundreds of genes, including most virulence factors, in response to the availability of key nutrients like GTP and branched-chain amino acids. Despite numerous studies examining how CodY controls gene expression directly or indirectly, virtually nothing is known about the extent to which CodY exerts its effect through small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). Herein, we report the first set of sRNAs under the control of CodY. We reveal that staphylococcal sRNA RsaD is overexpressed> 20-fold in a CodY-deficient strain in three S. aureus clinical isolates and in S. epidermidis. We validated CodY-dependent regulation of rsaD and demonstrate that CodY directly represses rsaD expression by binding the promoter. Using a combination of molecular techniques, we show that RsaD post-transcriptionally regulates alsS (acetolactate synthase) mRNA and enzyme levels. We further show that RsaD redirects carbon overflow , contributing to stationary phase cell death during exposure to weak acid stress. Taken together, our data delineate a role for CodY in controlling sRNA expression in a major human pathogen and indicate that RsaD may integrate nutrient depletion and other signals to mount a response to physiological stress experienced by S. aureus in diverse environments.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692093>Lactate Efflux from Intervertebral Disc Cells is Required for Maintenance of Spine Health.</a></h1><p>Maintenance of glycolytic  is postulated to be required for health of the spinal column. In the hypoxic tissues of the intervertebral disc and glycolytic cells of vertebral bone, glucose is metabolized into pyruvate for ATP generation and reduced to lactate to sustain redox balance. The rise in intracellular H /lactate concentrations are balanced by plasma-membrane monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). Using MCT4 null mice and human tissue samples, complimented with genetic and  approaches, we determine that H /lactate efflux is critical for maintenance of disc and vertebral bone health. Mechanistically, MCT4 maintains glycolytic and TCA cycle flux and intracellular pH homeostasis in the nucleus pulposus compartment of the disc, where HIF-1α directly activates an intronic enhancer in SLC16A3. Ultimately, our results provide support for research into lactate as a diagnostic biomarker for chronic, painful disc degeneration. This article is protected by copyright.

Special emphasis is given towards diagnostic criteria and therapeutic options.Consistent diagnostic criteria to define MetS in childhood and adolescence are not available to date. There is common agreement that the main features defining MetS include (1) disturbed glucose , (2) arterial hypertension, (3) dyslipidemia, and (4) abdominal obesity. However, settings of cut-off values are still heterogeneous in the pediatric population. Additional features that may define cardiometabolic risk, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFDL) or hyperuricemia, are not considered to date. Prevalence of childhood obesity has more than doubled since 1980, and 6-39% of obese children and adolescents already present with MetS, depending on the definition applied. There is common agreement that a consistent definition of MetS is urgently needed for children to identify those at risk as early as possible. Such definition criteria should consider age, gender, pubertal stage, or ethnicity. Additional features such as NAFDL or hyperuricemia should also be included in MetS criteria. Lifestyle modification is still the main basis to prevent or treat childhood obesity and MetS, as other therapeutic options (pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery) are not available or not recommended for the majority of affected youngster.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695461>Can Low SHBG Serum Concentration Be A Good Early Marker Of Male Hypogonadism In  Syndrome?</a></h1><p>In men suffering from  syndrome, accompanying insulin resistance may result in a lowering of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) plasma levels and cause changes in their androgenic status.The objective of the research was to assess selected androgens and SHBG plasma levels in males meeting diagnostic criteria for MS compared to healthy males.The group consisted of 65 men aged between 40 and 70 years old fitting IDF  syndrome criteria and 84 controls. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphate (DHEA-S), total and free testosterone and SHBG serum levels were evaluated. Calculated free and bioavailable testosterone were estimated using an algorithm proposed by the International Society for the Study of the Aging Male.Men diagnosed with MS showed a statistically significant decrease in plasma levels of DHEA in comparison to healthy ones: 11.579 (8.39-15.56) vs 14.014 (9.611-17.125) ng/mL; p = 0.0350, SHBG: 47.46 (35.78-62.83) vs 71.965 (54.45-91.56) nM/L; p<0.0001 and total testosterone: 5.2 (3.8-6.5) vs 6.3 (5.4-8.25) ng/mL; p = 0.0001 (values presented as a median with Q1-Q3).The results suggest that SHBG is a good early marker for  dysregulation in MS, considering its strength of association and significance is comparable to, or better than, those of MS criteria.© 2019 Jarecki et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692440>Exploration of the Hepatoprotective Effect and Mechanism of Swertia mussotii Franch in an Acute Liver Injury Rat Model.</a></h1><p>Swertia mussotii Franch, also known as "Zangyinchen",is one of a Tibetan traditional herb used for treatment of liver diseases over thousands of years at Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, has been confirmed to be hepatoprotective. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown.In this study, we evaluated the effect of S. mussotii treatment in a carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver injury rat model by examining the serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin levels and performing histological observations of the liver tissues.

Recent work indicates that this statement is not entirely correct. In reality, enzymes are not strictly specific, they often display weak side activities on intracellular metabolites (substrate promiscuity) that resemble their physiological substrate or slowly catalyze abnormal reactions on their physiological substrate (catalytic promiscuity). They thereby produce non-classical metabolites that are not efficiently metabolized by conventional enzymes. In an increasing number of cases, metabolite repair enzymes are being discovered that serve to eliminate these non-classical metabolites and prevent their accumulation. Metabolite repair enzymes also eliminate non-classical metabolites that are formed through spontaneous (i.e., not enzyme-catalyzed) reactions. Importantly, genetic deficiencies in several metabolite repair enzymes lead to 'inborn errors of metabolite repair', such as L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, 'ubiquitous glucose-6-phosphatase' (G6PC3) deficiency, the neutropenia present in Glycogen Storage Disease type Ib or defects in the enzymes that repair the hydrated forms of NADH or NADPH. Metabolite repair defects may be difficult to identify as such, because the mutated enzymes are non-classical enzymes that act on non-classical metabolites, which in some cases accumulate only inside the cells, and at rather low, yet toxic, concentrations. It is therefore likely that many additional metabolite repair enzymes remain to be discovered and that many diseases of metabolite repair still await elucidation.

To identify HAMLET's bacterial targets, here we used Streptococcus pneumoniae as a model organism and employed a proteomic approach that identified several potential candidates. Two of these targets were the glycolytic enzymes fructose bis-phosphate aldolase (FBPA) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Treatment of pneumococci with HAMLET immediately inhibited their ATP and lactate production, suggesting that HAMLET inhibits glycolysis. This observation was supported by experiments with recombinant bacterial enzymes, along with biochemical and bacterial viability assays, indicating that HAMLET's activity is partially inhibited by high glucose-mediated stimulation of glycolysis but enhanced in the presence of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose. Both HAMLET and ALA bound directly to each glycolytic enzyme in solution and solid phase assays and effectively inhibited their enzymatic activities. In contrast, oleic acid alone had little to no inhibitory activity. However, ALA alone also exhibited no bactericidal activity and did not block glycolysis in whole cells, suggesting a role for the lipid moiety in the internalization of HAMLET into the bacterial cells to reach its target(s). This was verified by inhibition of enzyme activity in whole cells after HAMLET but not ALA exposure. The results of this study suggest that part of HAMLET's antibacterial activity relates to its ability to target and inhibit glycolytic enzymes, providing an example of a natural antimicrobial agent that specifically targets glycolysis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696669>Aromatase Inhibitors and Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators: unconventional therapies for functional hypogonadism?</a></h1><p>Functional hypogonadism increases in prevalence due to ageing as well as an overall increase of obesity. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) could be an alternative for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), but have not yet been established as common clinical practice.We conducted a thorough search of the literature published between 2009 and 2018. Only RCTs published in English were included. We assessed the impact of AIs and SERMs on gonadal steroids, sexual function and semen parameters, body composition and glucose homeostasis, physical function, bone mineral density (BMD), anemia, as well as potential adverse effects.12 RCTs were included, with a total number of 645 patients. 145 men were included in RCTs comparing AIs versus placebo or TRT and 476 men in RCTs with SERMs versus placebo or TRT. One RCT compared AIs versus SERMs in 24 men. Inclusion criteria were heterogenic. Most studies only included a small number of patients (range 11-256) and follow-up time was relatively short (6 weeks to 12 months). AIs as well as SERMs increased serum testosterone levels. Overall, there was no effect on sexual symptoms nor on semen parameters. Following aromatase inhibition, only minimal improvement of body composition and physical function was observed in some of the trials, but spinal BMD decreased. SERMs only induced a small improvement in body composition. The effect of SERMs on physical function and on BMD was not assessed. No major adverse effects occurred.AIs are not recommended as treatment for functional hypogonadism because of insufficient efficacy as well as a decrease in BMD. SERMs might be an alternative for TRT, but more research is needed to evaluate their effect on hypogonadal signs and symptoms, as well as on their long-term safety profile.© 2019 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694877>The interaction between ABCA1 polymorphism and physical activity on the HDL-cholesterol levels in a Japanese population.</a></h1><p>Few studies have investigated the interactions between HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C)-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by genome-wide association (GWA) study and physical activity (PA) on HDL-C. First, we conducted a sex-stratified GWA study in a discovery sample (2,231 men and 2,431 women) and replication sample (2,599 men and 3,109 women) to identify SNPs influencing log-transformed HDL-C in Japanese participants in the baseline survey of Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. We also replicated previously reported HDL-C-related SNPs in a combined (discovery plus replication) sample (4,830 men and 5,540 women). We then analyzed the interactions of the HDL-C-related SNPs with PA on HDL-C. The sex-stratified GWA analyses identified 11 and 10 HDL-C-related SNPs in men and women as targets for an interaction analysis. Among these, only 1 interaction of ABCA1 rs1883025 with PA was statistically significant in men, after Bonferroni correction (P-interaction = 0.001 [α = 0.05/21 = 0.002]). The per-major-allele (C) increase in log-transformed HDL-C was lost in men with low PA (β = 0.008) compared with those with medium (β = 0.032) or high PA (β = 0.034).

Reports have distributed the spread rate of melanoma among white skin populations. Also, many studies have mentioned several causes of melanoma. Ultraviolet radiation was represented to be the most important reason for occurrence of melanoma. However, recent studies have found that a combination of factors, such as environmental and genetic factors, can contribute to occurrence of various cancers, specifically melanoma.  Different studies have been conducted on the efficacy of genetic disorders in melanoma. These surveys marked the key role of specific biomarkers in molecular and cellular processes, and investigations have found the expression of several genes in these processes. In addition, aberrant expression of these genes due to mutation and methylation can affect the whole process.  The expression process of these genes is regulated by microRNAs. These new biomolecules have been considered as negative regulators because of managing molecular and cellular processes. MicroRNAs are small conserved regulators attached to their targets leading to rearrangement of gene expression. Adherence of these noncoding RNAs can cause mRNA degradation or inhibit its translation.  Recently, the application of specific genes in melanoma has been studied. In this review, the way melanoma is regulated because of these biomarkers and their demand through cell cycle in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic periods was considered.

However, few reports have focused on the effects of different fatty acid (FA) compositions on the diversity of gut microbiota and its metabolites. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the effects of different dietary fats on liver mRNA expression levels of genes related to cholesterol and bile acid (BA) , as well as to investigate cecal microbiota composition and bacterial metabolites composition in rats. Four-week-old male Wistar/ST rats were fed a 15% fat diet for 30 days, including from different sources (soybean oil, lard, menhaden oil, or tuna oil). Then, the rats' cecal microbiota composition was determined by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene using next-generation sequencing. Lard diet drastically decreased the expression level of liver ATP-binding cassette subfamily G genes (Abcg5 and Abcg8 genes) compared with other diets. Menhaden oil diet increased the fecal BA excretion compared with soybean oil and lard diets. Fecal BA excretion tended to be positively correlated with the relative abundance of Firmicutes, and negatively correlated with the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes. These results have shown that dietary fats with different FA compositions have a different effect on the relative composition of cecal microbiota, and in particular, menhaden oil may have very different effects compared to other experimental fats. The effects of fish oils on the cecal microbiota may differ greatly depending on the ratio of EPA to DHA and the composition of FA other than n-3 polyunsaturated FA. Our results provided new insights on the way different dietary fat sources affect sterol  and alter cecal microbiota composition in rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693315>Bisphosphonate-Functionalized Scaffolds for Enhanced Bone Regeneration.</a></h1><p>The local sustained release of bioactive substances are attracting increasing attention in bone tissue engineering, which is beneficial to bone tissue formation and helps to improve the bone ingrowth ability of a scaffold. Bisphosphonates (BPs), as a representative kind of osteoclast inhibitors, are proven to possess excellent osteogenic induction capability. Accordingly, various physical and chemical strategies are developed to functionalize bone tissue scaffolds with BPs to achieve controlled release profiles. Compared with traditional treatment modalities, local release of BPs from these composite scaffolds will contribute to continuous bone integration without the risk of many complications. This review explores the molecular mechanisms of BPs on bone  and analyzes the appropriate concentrations of BPs that promote bone regeneration. The advanced BP loading strategies, implant modification technologies, and BP-loaded composite scaffolds based on different matrices are summarized. Finally, the latest advances and the future development of BP-modified scaffolds for enhanced bone regeneration are discussed.

Previous studies have identified mitigation of wear particle-induced inflammation and bone resorption as the main approaches to treat PPO. Recently, wear particle-induced reduction of bone formation around the prosthesis was identified as a major factor in the development of PPO. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a derivative of frankincense, has been shown to play a potential role in bone . However, whether AKBA enhances bone formation in wear particle-induced osteolysis remains unknown. In this study, we examined whether AKBA attenuates titanium particle-induced osteogenic reduction.  Titanium particles were used to induce osteolysis in murine calvaria, and micro-CT and histological analyses were used to evaluate the results. Mouse osteoblast cells, MC3T3-E1 were co-cultured with titanium particles to determine their effect on osteoblast formation .  We demonstrated that AKBA treatment significantly inhibited titanium particle-induced osteogenic inhibition by enhancing osteogenesis both  and . AKBA treatment also enhanced the phosphorylation of GSK-3β, decreased the degradation of β-catenin, and increased the translocation of β-catenin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Taken together, these results showed that AKBA treatment attenuated titanium-induced osteogenic inhibition by activating the GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.  These findings suggest that AKBA is a promising new target in the prevention and treatment of PPO.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694321>Effect of Heat Stress on Bacterial Composition and  in the Rumen of Lactating Dairy Cows.</a></h1><p>Heat stress negatively impacts the health and milk production of dairy cows, and ruminal microbial populations play an important role in dairy cattle's milk production. Currently there are no available studies that investigate heat stress-associated changes in the rumen microbiome of lactating dairy cattle. Improved understanding of the link between heat stress and the ruminal microbiome may be beneficial in developing strategies for relieving the influence of heat stress on ruminants by manipulating ruminal microbial composition. In this study, we investigated the ruminal bacterial composition and metabolites in heat stressed and non-heat stressed dairy cows. Eighteen lactating dairy cows were divided into two treatment groups, one with heat stress and one without heat stress. Dry matter intake was measured and rumen fluid from all cows in both groups was collected. The bacterial 16S rRNA genes in the ruminal fluid were sequenced, and the rumen pH and the lactate and acetate of the bacterial metabolites were quantified. Heat stress was associated with significantly decreased dry matter intake and milk production. Rumen pH and rumen acetate concentrations were significantly decreased in the heat stressed group, while ruminal lactate concentration increased. The influence of heat stress on the microbial bacterial community structure was minor. However, heat stress was associated with an increase in lactate producing bacteria (e.g.,  and unclassified ), and with an increase in , , and unclassified , all of which utilize soluble carbohydrates as an energy source. The relative abundance of acetate-producing bacterium  decreased during heat stress. We concluded that heat stress is associated with changes in ruminal bacterial composition and metabolites, with more lactate and less acetate-producing species in the population, which potentially negatively affects milk production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695981>Changes in Serum and Urinary Potassium Handling Associated with Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease Patients.</a></h1><p>Objective This study aimed to (i) compare the extent of urinary potassium (K) excretion in addition to the changes in serum K concentration: and (ii) clarify the association between changes in serum K concentration, urinary K excretion, and acid-base status with or without renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages. Methods Six hundred and ninety-one patients with advanced CKD (CKD G3b, 161; G4, 271; G5, 259) were retrospectively evaluated. Differences in serum K concentration, urinary K excretion, and serum sodium and chloride differences (Na-Cl) were compared among patients with RAAS inhibitors, RAAS inhibitors and diuretic agents, and without either medication in each CKD stage. Results Serum K concentrations in patients with RAAS inhibitors were significantly higher than in those with RAAS inhibitors and diuretics in CKD stage G3b and the other two treatment groups in CKD stage G4. Urinary K excretion among the three groups did not differ significantly in each CKD stage. Serum Na-Cl differences in patients with RAAS inhibitors were significantly smaller than in those with RAAS inhibitors and diuretics in CKD stages G3b ( = 0.006) and the other two groups in CKD stage G4 (vs. RAAS inhibitors and diuretics, p <0.001; vs. without either medication,  = 0.008). Conclusion Our study demonstrated that RAAS inhibitor use might be associated with hyperkalemia via not decreased urinary K excretion but rather K redistribution from intracellular to extracellular fluid induced by the progression of  acidosis in patients with advanced CKD, particularly stages G3b and G4.Copyright © 2019, Ueda et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692220>Early changes in tubular dysfunction markers and phosphorus  regulators as a result of switching from entecavir to tenofovir alafenamide fumarate nucleoside analogue therapy for chronic hepatitis B patients.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692432>Effects of Aging and Diet on Cardioprotection and Cardiometabolic Risk Markers.</a></h1><p>The prevalence of several diseases increases by age, including cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Aging, as a complex process characterized by graduated senescence, triggers various  such as oxidative stress, systemic inflammation,  dysfunction, but also telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction and deregulated autophagy. A better understanding of the senescence underlying mechanisms may lead to the development of new therapeutic targets and strategies for the age-related pathologies and extend the healthy lifespan.

Furthermore, such a strategy represents the most cost-effective approach, and the subjects' quality of life may be significantly improved. An integrated, personalized approach targeting at cardiometabolic aging and frailty is suggested in daily clinical practice. However, it should be started from an early age, while there is a need for further well designed and controlled studies in order to elucidate a link between the time of feeding, longevity and cardiovascular prevention.

As they can be influenced by individual genetic background, it is conceivably that the identification of variants in genes potentially involved could be used in genetic testing for the prevention of adverse effects during drug administration. Most genetic studies on severe DHRs have documented HLA alleles as risk factors and some mechanistic models support these associations, which try to shed light on the interaction between drugs and the immune system during lymphocyte presentation. In this sense, drugs are small molecules that behave as haptens, and currently three hypotheses try to explain how they interact with the immune system to induce DHRs: the hapten hypothesis, the direct pharmacological interaction of drugs with immune receptors hypothesis (p-i concept), and the altered self-peptide repertoire hypothesis. The way of interaction will depend on the nature of the drug and its reactivity, the metabolites generated and the specific HLA alleles. However, there is still a need of a better understanding of the different aspects related to the immunological mechanism, the drug determinants that are finally presented as well as the genetic factors for increasing the risk of suffering DHRs. Most available information on the predictive capacity of genetic testing refers to abacavir hypersensitivity and anticonvulsants-induced severe cutaneous reactions.

Spexin, a peptide hormone released from adipose tissue, is the most down-regulated gene in obese, compared to non-obese adipose tissue. Hence, it potentially contributes to the progression and development of  diseases. This study was designed to evaluate serum concentration of spexin in patients with MetS compared to weight-matched and normal-weight controls.  In this case-control study, 153 participants (51 per group) were collected from October 2014 to June 2016. The study groups were all matched for age and sex and included overweight/obese individuals with MetS and 2 control groups without MetS (including weight-matched and normal-weight participants). Body composition and serum concentration of spexin and leptin were measured.  Serum leptin and spexin levels were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in normal-weight compared to overweight/obese groups with/without MetS (p< 0.02). No significant difference was observed in serum leptin and spexin concentrations between the overweight/obese groups with/without MetS (p≥ 0.05). Also, spexin, with cutoff value of 4.6, had 78% sensitivity and 82% specificity for diagnosing overweight/obese from normal-weight participants. Spexin had 78% sensitivity and specificity, with cutoff value of 4.35, in diagnosing MetS participants from normal-weight group.

The intracellular level of c-di-GMP is controlled by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) with GGDEF domain and phosphodiesterases (PDEs) with either EAL or HD-GYP domain. Pseudomonas putida KT2440 has a large group of genes on its genome encoding proteins with GGDEF/EAL/HD-GYP domains. However, phenotypic-genotypic correlation and c-di-GMP  of these genes were largely unknown. Herein, by systematically constructing deletion mutants/overexpression strains of the 42 predicted c-di-GMP -related genes and analyzing the phenotypes, we preliminarily revealed the role of each gene in biofilm formation, colony morphology, and swimming motility. Subsequent results from protein sequence alignments and cellular c-di-GMP assessment indicated that 25 out of the 42 genes were likely to encode DGCs, nine genes were predicted to encode PDEs, four genes encoded bifunctional enzymes, and the other four genes encoded enzymatically inactive proteins. This study offers a basic understanding of the roles of these 42 genes and can serve as a toolkit for investigators to further elucidate the functions of these GGDEF and EAL/HD-GYP domain-containing proteins.

Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was used to determine inter- and intra-domain distances in the protein with and without EGCg and palmitic acid (PA). By labeling Cys-34 with 7-(diethyl amino)-4-methylcoumarin 3-maleimide (CPM), the distance between Trp-214 at domain IIA and CPM-Cys-34 at domain IA could be established. A small amount of PA decreased the distance, while a large amount increased the distance up to 5.4 Å. EGCg increased the inter-domain distance in HSA and HSA-PA up to 2.8 and 7.6 Å, respectively. We concluded that PA affects protein conformation more significantly compared to EGCg. Circular dichroism (CD) established that EGCg affects protein secondary structure more significantly than PA. PA had little effect on the α-helix content of HSA, while EGCg decreased the α-helix content in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, EGCg decreased α-helix content in HSA and HSA-PA to the same level. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) data revealed that both PA and EGCg increased HSA aggregation. EGCg increased HSA aggregation more significantly and promoted formation of aggregates that were more heterogenous. Any of these effects could impact the ability of serum albumin to transport and stabilize ligands including EGCg and other polyphenols.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693883>Glycogen Dynamics Drives Lipid Droplet Biogenesis during Brown Adipocyte Differentiation.</a></h1><p>Browning induction or transplantation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) or brown/beige adipocytes derived from progenitor or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can represent a powerful strategy to treat  diseases. However, our poor understanding of the mechanisms that govern the differentiation and activation of brown adipocytes limits the development of such therapy. Various genetic factors controlling the differentiation of brown adipocytes have been identified, although most studies have been performed using in vitro cultured pre-adipocytes. We investigate here the differentiation of brown adipocytes from adipose progenitors in the mouse embryo. We demonstrate that the formation of multiple lipid droplets (LDs) is initiated within clusters of glycogen, which is degraded through glycophagy to provide the  substrates essential for de novo lipogenesis and LD formation. Therefore, this study uncovers the role of glycogen in the generation of LDs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the role of ferroptosis,a newly discovered form of oxidative cell death, has not been evaluated widely.Panx1, an ATP-releasing pathway family, has anti-inflammatory effects during kidneyinjury. Here, we demonstrated that panx1 deletion protected against renal IRI byregulating ferroptotic cell death. In panx1 knockout mice subjected to renal IRI,decreased plasma creatinine, MDA contents in kidney tissue, and tubular cell death(decreased TUNEL positive renal tubular cells) were found compared to those inpanx1 wild type (wt) mice. In cultured human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells, erastin inducedferroptotic lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation were significantly attenuated bysilencing panx1 expression. Moreover, panx1 silencing significantly modulatedferroptosis related protein expression. Furthermore, Panx1 deletion induced theexpression of a cytoprotective chaperone, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), andmodulated the MAPK/ERK pathway. In this study, we first discovered that panx1deletion protects against renal IRI by attenuating MAPK/ERK activation and inducingHO-1 expression in a ferroptotic way.

The average daily gain (p = .025) and feed efficiency (p = .011) in rice-fed piglets were significantly higher than those in corn-fed piglets. Liver lysine-ketoglutarate reductase activity tended to be lower (p = .073) in rice-fed piglets than in corn-fed piglets.

We evaluated the association of the copy number of the glutathione S-transferase M1 () gene and degree of iron overload among patients with SCA. We compared LIC in 38 children with SCA and ≥12 lifetime erythrocyte transfusions stratified by  genotype. Baseline LIC was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), R2*MRI within 3 months prior to, and again after, starting iron unloading therapy. After controlling for weight-corrected transfusion burden (mL/kg) and splenectomy, mean pre-chelation LIC (mg/g dry liver dry weight) was similar in all groups:  wild-type (WT) (11.45, SD±6.8), heterozygous (8.2, SD±4.52), and homozygous  deletion (-null; 7.8, SD±6.9,  = 0.09).

However, differences in pathogenicity between two human parasites, Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis, remain unknown. Related genetic studies are limited by RNA extraction difficulties and molecular data deficiencies. In this study, RNA extraction, de novo sequencing, functional annotation, and differential gene expression analyses were performed to compare D. folliculorum and D. brevis. This yielded 67.09 and 65.10 million clean reads, respectively, with similar annotations. Bioinformatics analyses and manual alignments identified 237 coding sequences comprising 48 genes from 29 families, including five important functional classes. Of these, 30 genes from 20 families related to , motion, detoxification and stress response, and allergic reaction were differentially expressed between the two species. Cathepsin type 1, serine protease inhibitor, arginine kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, muscle-specific protein 20-2, myosin alkaline light chain, troponin C, tropomyosin, and heat shock protein 90 were highly expressed in D. folliculorum, whereas cathepsin type 2, aspartic protease, serine protease, myosin heavy chain type 2, and alpha tubulin type 1C were highly expressed in D. brevis. Verified coding sequences were nearly consistent with unigene clusters. Further, absolute quantification results demonstrated that differentially expressed genes followed the predicted expression trend. Therefore, the first RNA sequencing and functional annotation analysis of two Demodex species was successful. Differential expression of important functional genes is likely implicated in pathogenicity disparities between these two species.

However, treatment resistance emerges inevitably. Here, we performed global metabolite screening with metabolite set enrichment coupled with transcriptome and gene set enrichment analysis and proteomic screening, and identified substantial reprogramming of tumor  involving oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) with substantial accumulation of acyl-carnitines accompanied by an increase of PGC1α in response to genetic (shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9) and pharmacological (crizotinib) inhibition of c-MET. Extracellular flux and carbon tracing analyses (U-13C-Glucose, U-13C-Glutamine and U-13C-palmitic acid) demonstrated enhanced oxidative , which was driven by FAO and supported by increased anaplerosis of glucose carbons. These findings were observed in concert with increased number and fusion of mitochondria and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Genetic interference with PGC1α rescued this oxidative phenotype driven by c-MET inhibition. Silencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that CREB regulates the expression of PGC1α in the context of c-MET inhibition. Interference with both oxidative phosphorylation (metformin, oligomycin) and beta-oxidation of fatty acids (etomoxir) enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of c-MET inhibition. Synergistic cell death was observed with c-MET inhibition and gamitrinib treatment. In patient-derived xenograft models, combination treatments of crizotinib and etomoxir, and crizotinib and gamitrinib were significantly more efficacious than single treatments and did not induce toxicity. Collectively, we have unraveled the mechanistic underpinnings of c-MET inhibition and identified novel combination therapies that may enhance its therapeutic efficacy.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695560>Ginseng extracts modulate mitochondrial bioenergetics of live cardiomyoblasts: a functional comparison of different extraction solvents.</a></h1><p>The root of , a member of Araliaceae family, has been used as herbal medicine and functional food in Asia for thousands of years.

Aberrant homeostasis of lipid  has been observed in various tumors; however, the molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated.  Yin yang 1 (YY1) expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was analyzed using clinical specimens, and its roles in HCC in lipid  were examined using gain- and loss-of function experiments. The mechanism of YY1 regulation on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1β (PGC-1β) and its downstream genes medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) were investigated using molecular biology and biochemical methods. The role of YY1/ PGC-1β axis in hepatocarcinogenesis was studied using xenograft experiment.  This study showed that YY1 suppresses fatty acid β-oxidation, leading to increase of cellular triglyceride level and lipid accumulation in HCC cells, and subsequently induction of the tumorigenesis potential of HCC cells. Molecular mechanistic study revealed that YY1 blocks the expression of , an activator of fatty acid β-oxidation, by directly binding to its promoter; and thus downregulates PGC-1β/MCAD and PGC1-β/LCAD axis. Importantly, we revealed that YY1 inhibition on  occurs irrespective of the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1-α), enabling it to promote lipid accumulation under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.

Severe fasting induces 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which attenuates mTORC1 activation. However, the effect of RE on the response of mTORC1 signaling proteins after a period of severe fasting is unclear. We investigated the effect of RE on rat skeletal muscle protein  after a period of severe fasting. We hypothesized that RE-induced activation of mTORC1 signaling protein attenuates protein breakdown by autophagy. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into ordinary-fed (C) and 72-h fasting (F) groups. A bout of RE was replicated by percutaneous electrical stimulation in the right gastrocnemius muscle. The tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) Ser1387 and autophagy marker of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3-II (LC3B-II) expression of the F group increased twice that of the C group in sedentary state (P < 0.05). RE activated the mTORC1 signaling pathway in both groups (P < 0.05); however, in the F group, the magnitude of p70S6K (Thr389) phosphorylation was lower by 40% of that of the C group (P < 0.05). Protein synthesis after RE was increased by 50% from the level at sedentary state in the C group (P < 0.05), but not in the F. In the F group, the expression of LC3B-II at 3 h after RE was decreased by almost 25% from the level at sedentary state (P < 0.05).

However, how mA writers attain substrate specificities remains unclear. We report the 3.1 Å-resolution crystal structure of human CCHC zinc finger-containing protein ZCCHC4, a 28S rRNA-specific mA methyltransferase, bound to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. The methyltransferase (MTase) domain of ZCCHC4 is packed against N-terminal GRF-type and C2H2 zinc finger domains and a C-terminal CCHC domain, creating an integrated RNA-binding surface. Strikingly, the MTase domain adopts an autoinhibitory conformation, with a self-occluded catalytic site and a fully-closed cofactor pocket. Mutational and enzymatic analyses further substantiate the molecular basis for ZCCHC4-RNA recognition and a role of the stem-loop structure within substrate in governing the substrate specificity. Overall, this study unveils unique structural and enzymatic characteristics of ZCCHC4, distinctive from what was seen with the METTL family of mA writers, providing the mechanistic basis for ZCCHC4 modulation of mA RNA methylation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693892>Metformin Improves Mitochondrial Respiratory Activity through Activation of AMPK.</a></h1><p>Impaired mitochondrial respiratory activity contributes to the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Metformin, a first-line antidiabetic drug, functions mainly by improving patients' hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. However, its mechanism of action is still not well understood. We show here that pharmacological metformin concentration increases mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and ATP levels in hepatocytes and a clinically relevant metformin dose increases liver mitochondrial density and complex 1 activity along with improved hyperglycemia in high-fat- diet (HFD)-fed mice. Metformin, functioning through 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), promotes mitochondrial fission to improve mitochondrial respiration and restore the mitochondrial life cycle. Furthermore, HFD-fed-mice with liver-specific knockout of AMPKα1/2 subunits exhibit higher blood glucose levels when treated with metformin. Our results demonstrate that activation of AMPK by metformin improves mitochondrial respiration and hyperglycemia in obesity. We also found that supra-pharmacological metformin concentrations reduce adenine nucleotides, resulting in the halt of mitochondrial respiration. These findings suggest a mechanism for metformin's anti-tumor effects.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Acylated ghrelin (AG) and desacylated ghrelin (DAG) are the two main forms of ghrelin, which have opposing roles in energy homeostasis. The AG/DAG ratio has been proposed to be associated with  syndrome (MetS) in the general population.

Fasting blood samples were collected for the analyses of  and ghrelin parameters. The serum levels of total ghrelin and AG were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. DAG level was calculated by subtracting the AG level from the total ghrelin level.We recruited 151 subjects with schizophrenia, and classified them into those with MetS ( = 41) and those without MetS ( = 110). Subjects with MetS had a significantly higher AG/DAG ratio, as well as lower total ghrelin and DAG levels. There were no sex differences in ghrelin parameters. The AG/DAG ratio was significantly and positively correlated with weight, body mass index, waist circumference, insulin level, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and number of MetS components. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the number of MetS components remained significantly associated with the AG/DAG ratio.Our results revealed that lower AG/DAG ratios were associated with better  profiles in olanzapine-treated patients with schizophrenia.

All clinical trials that compared the effects of probiotic supplementations with a control group using end points serum levels of fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) and oxidative stress biomarkers were included. Two independent researchers screened the data extracted from the relevant studies. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) was estimated using the random or fixed effects model. Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using Q-test.Overall, 13 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving 840 subjects with T2DM were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis showed that probiotics intake resulted in significant improvement in serum levels of FBS [SMD: -0.35, 95% CI: (-0.59, -0.12)], total antioxidant status (TAS) [SMD: 0.33, 95% CI: (0.11, 0.55)], total glutathione (GSH) [SMD: 0.41, 95% CI: (0.26, 0.56)] and malondialdehyde (MDA) [SMD: -0.54, 95% CI: (-0.83, -0.26)]. No significant improvement was found in HbA1C [SMD: -0.06, 95% CI:(-0.82, 0.69)], and nitric oxide (NO) [SMD:-0.24, 95% CI:(-1.10, 0.62)] levels.It seems that gut microbiota can exert beneficial effects in diabetic patients via altering oxidative stress' biomarkers. The beneficial effect of gut microbiota however was modest on FBS and non-significant on HbA1C. These results need to be confirmed by conducting more reliable RCTs.CRD42019134905.

In this paper, an integrated metabolomic method was presented for a systematic discovery of potential active components in Fangji Huangqi Tang (FHT), a well-known TCM prescription for nephrotic syndrome treatment, based on "correlations between chemical and  profiles." Firstly, a metabolomics study was carried out to select representative biomarkers of nephrotic syndrome. Then, after drug administration, the dynamic process of serum composition was investigated by the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS) technique to detect the prototypes and related metabolites of relative components from FHT. Pearson correlation analysis was finally used to find out the correlations between the endogenous  spectrums and the chemical serum spectrums. As a result, 17 biomarkers for nephrotic syndrome indication were identified, and the main   of their concern included linoleic acid ; cyanoamino acid ; alpha-linolenic acid ; glycine, serine, and threonine ; arachidonic acid ; and glycerophospholipid . Meanwhile, active components in FHT for nephrotic syndrome treatment were screened out, including (+)-tetrandrine demethylation, fenfangjine G hydrogenation, tetrandrine, -methylfangchinoline, tetrandrine demethylation, fangchinoline, glycyrrhetic acid, astragaloside II alcohol dehydration, atractylenolide III demethylation + hydrogenation, atractylenolide III demethylation + hydrogenation, and licoricone--acetylcysteine conjugation. This study demonstrated a promising way to elucidate the active chemical material basis of TCM prescription.Copyright © 2019 Liu, Zhou, Zhu, Xie and Cai.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690974>NMR-based metabolomics reveals the metabolite profiles of Vibrio parahaemolyticus under blood agar stimulation.</a></h1><p>Vibrio parahemolyticus is a halophilic bacterium which causes widespread seafood poisoning pathogenicity.

This assertion is supported by evidence that the disruption of mouse Shmt2 induces mitochondrial respiration defects in mouse embryonic fibroblasts generated from Shmt2-knockout E13.5 embryos experiencing anaemia and lethality. Here, we elucidated the potential mechanisms by which the disruption of this gene induces mitochondrial respiration defects and embryonic anaemia using Shmt2-knockout E13.5 embryos. The livers but not the brains of Shmt2-knockout E13.5 embryos presented mitochondrial respiration defects and growth retardation. Metabolomic profiling revealed that Shmt2 deficiency induced foetal liver-specific downregulation of 1C-  that create taurine and nucleotides required for mitochondrial respiratory function and cell division, respectively, resulting in the manifestation of mitochondrial respiration defects and growth retardation. Given that foetal livers function to produce erythroblasts in mouse embryos, growth retardation in foetal livers directly induced depletion of erythroblasts. By contrast, mitochondrial respiration defects in foetal livers also induced depletion of erythroblasts as a consequence of the inhibition of erythroblast differentiation, resulting in the manifestation of anaemia in Shmt2-knockout E13.5 embryos.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692191>Metaanalysis on obesity and risk of inflammatory bowel disease: Reanalysis is needed.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690792>Programming effects of maternal and gestational obesity on offspring  and  inflammation.</a></h1><p>With the increasing prevalence of obesity in women of reproductive age there is a need to understand the ramifications of this on offspring. The purpose of this study is to investigate the programming effects of maternal obesity during preconception and the preconception/gestational period on adiposity and adipose tissue inflammation in offspring using an animal model. Adult female C57Bl/6J mice were assigned either normal diet, high fat diet (HFD) prior to pregnancy, or HFD prior to and through pregnancy. Some offspring were maintained on normal diet while others started HFD later in life. Offspring were assessed for body composition and  responses. Lipid storing tissues were evaluated for expansion and inflammation. Male offspring from the preconception group had the greatest weight gain, most subcutaneous adipose tissue, and largest liver mass when introduced to postnatal HFD. Male offspring of the preconception/gestation group had worsened glucose tolerance and an increase in resident (CD11c) adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) when exposed to postnatal HFD. Female offspring had no significant difference in any parameter between the diet treatment groups. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that prenatal and pregnancy windows have independent programming effects on offspring. Preconception exposure affects body composition and adiposity while gestation exposure affects  and tissue immune cell phenotypes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690989>Plasma cathepsin D activity is negatively associated with hepatic insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese humans.</a></h1><p>Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver plays a major role in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. The hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp is considered the gold standard for assessing peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity, yet it is a costly and labour-intensive procedure. Therefore, easy-to-measure, cost-effective approaches to determine insulin sensitivity are needed to enable organ-specific interventions. Recently, evidence emerged that plasma cathepsin D (CTSD) is associated with insulin sensitivity and hepatic inflammation. Here, we aimed to investigate whether plasma CTSD is associated with hepatic and/or peripheral insulin sensitivity in humans.As part of two large clinical trials (one designed to investigate the effects of antibiotics, and the other to investigate polyphenol supplementation, on insulin sensitivity), 94 overweight and obese adults (BMI 25-35 kg/m) previously underwent a two-step hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (using [6,6-H]glucose) to assess hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity (per cent suppression of endogenous glucose output during the low-insulin-infusion step, and the rate of glucose disappearance during high-insulin infusion [40 mU/(m × min)], respectively). In this secondary analysis, plasma CTSD levels, CTSD activity and plasma inflammatory cytokines were measured.Plasma CTSD levels were positively associated with the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNF-α (IL-8: standardised β = 0.495, p < 0.001; TNF-α: standardised β = 0.264, p = 0.012). Plasma CTSD activity was negatively associated with hepatic insulin sensitivity (standardised β = -0.206, p = 0.043), independent of age, sex, BMI and waist circumference, but it was not associated with peripheral insulin sensitivity. However, plasma IL-8 and TNF-α were not significantly correlated with hepatic insulin sensitivity.We demonstrate that plasma CTSD activity, but not systemic inflammation, is inversely related to hepatic insulin sensitivity, suggesting that plasma CTSD activity may be used as a non-invasive marker for hepatic insulin sensitivity in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696446>Pediatric growth hormone therapy in Greece: analysis of the Hellenic cohort of the GeNeSIS study.</a></h1><p>To describe the data from the Greek cohort of the Genetics and Neuroendocrinology of Short Stature International Study (GeNeSIS).GeNeSIS was a prospective, open-label, multinational, observational study collecting information on clinical outcomes and treatment safety of children with growth disorders treated with growth hormone (GH), according to national indications. After informed consent, 305 patients (143 females), including 255 patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and 30 with Turner syndrome (TS), from eight investigational sites, were enrolled in Greece. Demographic data, treatment efficacy, and adverse events were reported at the discretion of attending physicians.Treatment with GH was undertaken for 247/255 patients with GHD and 29/30 with TS. The majority of patients treated with GHD (73.7%) and TS (84%) with recorded Tanner stage were prepubertal at enrolment. Among patients treated with GHD and TS, 70.45% and 55% were GH-naïve at study entry, respectively. Height standard deviation score (SDS), height velocity SDS, and height SDS-target height SDS numerically improved during the 4-year observation period. The effect of GH treatment was more prominent in the first year of treatment, especially in the GHD group.In the Greek cohort of GeNeSIS, GHD is the most frequent indication for GH treatment, followed by TS. While the latter is diagnosed somewhat earlier, GH treatment is not as efficacious as for patients with GHD. No major safety issues were reported during follow-up.

Recently, energy  in adipose tissue has been the subject of renewed interest, because significant energy expenditure can be induced in cells derived from white adipose tissue progenitors, in addition to brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here we evaluated whether aging-associated change in various adipose tissue depots affects the progression of NAFLD.Six-week-old male C57BL/6NCrSlc mice were fed control chow (C) or high-fat diet (60% fat; HF) for 12 or 24 weeks (12w/C, 12w/HF, 24w/C and 24w/HF groups, respectively) or switched from C to HF diet at 18 weeks of age (24w/C/HF group) and fed for a further 24 weeks. Some 24w/HF mice received a subcutaneous transplantation of adipose progenitors (10 cells/mouse) from young donor mice. Basal energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and liver and adipose tissue histology were then evaluated. In addition, features of senescence and the capacity of adipose progenitors to "brown" were compared in mice of various ages.12w/HF mice demonstrated compensation in the forms of hypertrophy of interscapular classical BAT and the appearance of subcutaneous beige adipocytes, consistent with improved  homeostasis. In contrast, 24w/HF and 24w/C/HF mice developed obesity, glucose intolerance, and severe NAFLD, with accelerated senescence and loss of adipose progenitors in subcutaneous fat tissues. Recruitment of adipose progenitors ameliorated these findings in 24w/HF mice.Impaired  compensation in adipose tissue resulted in the progression of NAFLD, which was associated with aging-related deterioration in adipose progenitors. A new approach targeting adipose tissue progenitors might represent a potential strategy for the prevention of NAFLD.© 2019 Taketani et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696297>Recent progress in nanomaterial-based electrochemical and optical sensors for hypoxanthine and xanthine.

However, glycerol is catabolized in a fully respiratory manner by the eukaryotic platform organism . We previously engineered   strains to favor fermentative  of glycerol by replacing the native FAD-dependent glycerol catabolic pathway with the NAD-dependent 'DHA pathway'. In addition, a heterologous aquaglyceroporin (Fps1 homolog) was expressed to facilitate glycerol uptake. The current study was launched to scrutinize the formation of 's natural fermentation product ethanol from glycerol caused by the conducted genetic modifications. This understanding is supposed to facilitate future engineering of this yeast for fermenting glycerol into valuable products more reduced than ethanol.A strain solely exhibiting the glycerol catabolic pathway replacement produced ethanol at concentrations close to the detection limit. The expression of the heterologous aquaglyceroporin caused significant ethanol production (8.5 g L from 51.5 g L glycerol consumed) in a strain catabolizing glycerol via the DHA pathway but not in the wild-type background. A reduction of oxygen availability in the shake flask cultures further increased the ethanol titer up to 15.7 g L (from 45 g L glycerol consumed).The increased yield of cytosolic NADH caused by the glycerol catabolic pathway replacement seems to be a minimal requirement for the occurrence of alcoholic fermentation in   growing in synthetic glycerol medium. The remarkable  switch to ethanol formation in the DHA pathway strain with the heterologous aquaglyceroporin supports the assumption of a much stronger influx of glycerol accompanied by an increased rate of cytosolic NADH production via the DHA pathway. The fact that a reduction of oxygen supply increases ethanol production in DHA pathway strains is in line with the hypothesis that a major part of glycerol in normal shake flask cultures still enters the catabolism in a respiratory manner.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692782>Sesamol intervention ameliorates obesity-associated  disorders by regulating hepatic lipid  in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>Obesity has currently become a serious social problem to be solved. Sesamol, a natural bioactive substance extracted from sesame oil, has shown multiple physiological functions, and it might have an effect on the treatment of obesity.This study was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of sesamol on the treatment of obesity and  disorders in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.C57BL/6J male mice were fed HFD for 8 weeks to induce obesity, followed by supplementation with sesamol (100 mg/kg body weight [b.w.]/day [d] by gavage) for another 4 weeks. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe lipid accumulation in adipose tissues and liver. Chemistry reagent kits were used to measure serum lipids, hepatic lipids, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. ELISA kits were used to determine the serum insulin and free fatty acid (FFA) levels. Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels involved in lipid  in the liver.Sesamol significantly reduced the body weight gain of obese mice and suppressed lipid accumulation in adipose tissue and liver. Sesamol also improved serum and hepatic lipid profiles, and increased insulin sensitivity. In the sesamol-treated group, the levels of serum ALT and AST decreased significantly. Furthermore, after sesamol treatment, the hepatic sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1c) decreased, while the phosphorylated hormone sensitive lipase (p-HSL), the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α (CPT1α), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC1α) increased, which were responsible for the fatty acid synthesis, lipolysis, and fatty acid β-oxidation, respectively.Sesamol had a positive effect on anti-obesity and ameliorated the  disorders of obese mice.

However, the mechanistic  principles remain poorly understood. In the framework of a multi-organ investigation of age-associated changes of ceramide species, a unique and distinctive change pattern of C and C ceramide species was detected in aged skeletal muscle. Consistently, the expression of CerS1 and CerS5 mRNA, encoding the ceramide synthases (CerS) with substrate preference for C and C acyl chains, respectively, was down-regulated in skeletal muscle of aged mice. Similarly, an age-dependent decline of both CerS1 and CerS5 mRNA expression was observed in skeletal muscle biopsies of humans. Moreover, CerS1 and CerS5 mRNA expression was also reduced in muscle biopsies from patients in advanced stage of chronic heart failure (CHF) suffering from muscle wasting and frailty. The possible impact of CerS1 and CerS5 on muscle function was addressed by reversed genetic analysis using CerS1 and CerS5 knockout mice. Skeletal muscle from mice deficient of either CerS1 or CerS5 showed reduced caliber sizes of both slow (type 1) and fast (type 2) muscle fibers, fiber grouping, and fiber switch to type 1 fibers. Moreover, CerS1- and CerS5-deficient mice exhibited reduced twitch and tetanus forces of musculus extensor digitorum longus. The findings of this study link CerS1 and CerS5 to histopathological changes and functional impairment of skeletal muscle in mice that might also play a functional role for the aging skeletal muscle and for age-related muscle wasting disorders in humans.© 2019 The Authors.

The objective of this study was to use quantitative hybrid PET/MR to evaluate the effects of surgery treatment on the symptomatic unilateral internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery steno-occlusive disease.Fifteen patients diagnosed with ischaemic cerebrovascular disease were evaluated using a hybrid TOF PET/MR system (Signa, GE Healthcare). The CBF value measured by arterial spin labelling (ASL) and the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) measured by F-FDG PET were obtained, except for the infarct area and its contralateral side, before and after bypass surgery. The asymmetry index (AI) was calculated from the CBF and SUVR of the ipsilateral and contralateral cerebral hemispheres, respectively. The ΔCBF and ΔSUVR were calculated as the percent changes of CBF and SUVR between before and after surgery, and paired t tests were used to determine whether a significant change occurred. Spearman's rank correlation was also used to compare CBF with glucose  in the same region.The analysis primarily revealed that after bypass surgery, a statistically significant increase occurred in the CBF on the affected side (P < 0.01). The postprocedural SUVR was not significantly higher than the preprocedural SUVR (P > 0.05). However, the postprocedural AI values for CBF and SUVR were significantly lower after surgery than before surgery (P < 0.01). A significant correlation was found between the AI values for preoperative CBF and SUVR on the ipsilateral hemisphere (P < 0.01).The present study demonstrates that a combination of ASL and F-FDG PET could be used to simultaneously analyse changes in patients' cerebral haemodynamic patterns and  between before and after superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass surgery. This therefore represents an essential tool for the evaluation of critical haemodynamic and  status in patients with symptomatic unilateral ischaemic cerebrovascular disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694085>Corrigenda: Table Correction.

Acromegaly is a rare disorder caused by overproduction of growth hormone (GH) and is associated with functional and structural differentiation of adipose and muscle tissues. Acromegalic subjects are also at risk of vascular diseases and  dysfunctions. We aimed to determine the altered levels of irisin in subjects with active acromegaly and controlled acromegaly and in controls, and to ascertain whether there is an association between irisin and hormonal and cardiometabolic parameters.We enrolled 40 subjects with active acromegaly, 30 subjects with controlled acromegaly, and 40 control subjects of matched age, gender, BMI, and occurrence of hypertension, diabetes, and  syndrome distribution in the present cross-sectional study. Hormonal and  parameters, carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), and epicardial fat thickness (EFT) of the subjects were evaluated. Irisin levels were measured using ELISA.Circulating levels of irisin were significantly higher in acromegalic subjects compared to both controlled acromegalic subjects and controls. Moreover, irisin levels were elevated in controlled acromegalic subjects compared to controls. Irisin displayed a positive correlation with insulin resistance, cIMT, EFT, BMI, GH, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) in acromegalic subjects. Irisin levels were independently associated with cIMT and EFT according to multiple regression analyses. There was an independent relationship between irisin and IGF-1.Elevated irisin levels in acromegalic subjects were associated with cIMT and EFT, suggesting that irisin is a surrogate marker for cardiovascular risk in acromegalic subjects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694287>An Appraisal of Developments in Allium Sulfur Chemistry: Expanding the Pharmacopeia of Garlic.</a></h1><p>Alliums and allied plant species are rich sources of sulfur compounds that have effects on vascular homeostasis and the control of  systems linked to nutrient  in mammals.

Although recent studies suggested the importance of type 2 immunity in an anti-inflammatory microenvironment in adipose tissue, the regulatory effects of T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines on systemic  regulation are not fully understood. Recently, we identified the roles of the Th2 cytokine (interleukin 4 [IL-4] and IL-13)-induced adipokine, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), in adipose tissue in regulating systemic glucose  via signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) activation. Moreover, we showed that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is required to maintain these macrophage-regulating autocrine and paracrine signaling  via Th2 cytokine-induced secretion of GDF15.

Compared to the intensively investigated transcriptome and proteome, the  response to heat stress is not sufficiently characterized. Mitochondria have been recognized to play an essential role in heat stress tolerance. Given the compartmentalization of the cell, it is not clear if the heat stress-induced  response occurs in mitochondria or in the cytosol. Therefore, a compartment-specific metabolite analysis was performed to analyze the heat stress-induced  response in mitochondria and the cytoplasm. In this work, the isolated mitochondria and the cytoplasm of yeast cells grown at permissive temperature and cells adapting to heat stress were subjected to mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Over a hundred metabolites could be identified, covering amino acid , energy , arginine , purine and pyrimidine , and others. Highly accumulated citrulline and reduced arginine suggested remodeled arginine . A stable isotope-labeled experiment was performed to analyze the heat stress-induced  remodeling of the arginine , identifying activated  ornithine biosynthesis to support arginine and spermidine synthesis. The short-term increased spermidine and trehalose suggest their important roles as heat stress markers. These data provide  clues of heat stress-induced  remodeling, which helps in understanding the heat stress response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696503>Resveratrol ameliorates high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance and fatty acid oxidation via ATM-AMPK axis in skeletal muscle.</a></h1><p>Resveratrol (RSV) is a polyphenolic phytoalexin that exhibits diverse pharmacological actions, including its effect on the insulin resistance. However, the mechanism through which RSV improves insulin resistance is not fully understood yet. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism through which RSV ameliorates insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse model, as well as palmitic acid (PA) treated L6 cells, with a specific focus on the response of RSV on fatty acid oxidation.Male C57BL6/J mice were randomly divided into three groups: normal diet-fed mice (ND), the high-fat diet-fed mice (HFD), HFD supplemented with RSV (100 mg/kg body weight [BW]/day orally; n = 10). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid levels were determined. The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was used to measure blood glucose and area under the curve. The quantitative insulin sensitivity index was calculated to assess insulin resistance. Skeletal muscles were collected for histology study and protein expression measurement. L6 cells were cultured with PA and the glucose concentration in the culture medium, and the intracellular TG levels were tested. RSV, chloroquine, palmitoyltransferase and Ku-55933 were administered to differentiate L6 cells.The HFD fed mice showed increased BW, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia. The expressions of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, cytochrome oxidase subunit IV protein were significantly decreased in the skeletal muscles of HFD fed mice and PA-treated L6 cells. All these effects induced by HFD and PA were reversed by RSV treatment.ATM is a key factor to improve HFD-induced lipid  and insulin resistance in skeletal muscles. The effects of RSV on ameliorating HFD-induced abnormal lipid  and insulin resistance mediated through ATM-AMPK pathway may due to its improvement in fatty acid oxidation efficiency and sequential reduction in ROS production in skeletal muscle. These results provide important theoretical evidence for the application of RSV in the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus and related  diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692759>Acute effect of a cod protein hydrolysate on postprandial acylated ghrelin concentration and sensations associated with appetite in healthy subjects: a double-blind crossover trial.</a></h1><p>Fish protein hydrolysates are suggested to contain bioactive sequences capable of affecting   involved in the regulation of glucose  and body weight when consumed in low doses. Modulation of the appetite-regulating hormone ghrelin may explain suppression of insulin secretion and weight loss observed in previous studies with fish protein hydrolysates.This study aimed to assess the effect of a single, low dose of cod protein hydrolysate (CPH) before a breakfast meal on postprandial acylated ghrelin concentration and sensations associated with appetite in healthy subjects.In this explorative trial with a crossover design, 41 healthy individuals (15 males and 26 females, age 51 ± 6 years) completed 2 study days separated by 4-7 days of washout. On both study days, a test drink containing 20 mg CPH or casein (control) per kg body weight was given immediately before a standardized breakfast meal. Acylated ghrelin concentrations were measured before test drink/breakfast (baseline) and at time 0, 20, 40, 80, and 180 min postprandially. Sensations associated with appetite were measured by a Visual Analog Scale (100 mm) at baseline and 0, 20, 40, and 180 min postprandially.Statistically, no difference was observed between CPH and control for postprandial acylated ghrelin concentrations (mean difference geometric mean: 1.05 pg/mL, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97-1.13,  = 0.266), or between the total area under the curve (tAUC) for acylated ghrelin after CPH (tAUC = 17518 pg/mL × min, 95% CI: 0-47941) and control (tAUC = 17272 pg/mL × min, 95% CI: 0-48048,  = 0.991). No differences were found between CPH and control for sensation of appetite, according to tAUC of postprandial scores for satiety ( = 0.794) and the feeling of fullness ( = 0.996).We did not find an effect of a single dose of CPH on postprandial concentrations of acylated ghrelin or sensations related to feeling of hunger, compared to control. Further studies should aim to evaluate the effect of a supplement with CPH given daily over a period of time.© 2019 Hanna Fjeldheim Dale et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694658>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids status and cognitive function in young women.</a></h1><p>Research indicates that low omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) may be associated with decreased cognitive function. This study examined the association between n-3 PUFA status and cognitive function in young Australian women.This was a secondary outcome analysis of a cross-sectional study that recruited 300 healthy women (18-35 y) of normal weight (NW: BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m) or obese weight (OB: BMI ≥30.0 kg/m). Participants completed a computer-based cognition testing battery (IntegNeuro™) evaluating the domains of impulsivity, attention, information processing, memory and executive function. The Omega-3 Index (O3I) was used to determine n-3 PUFA status (percentage of EPA (20:5n-3) plus DHA (22:6n3) in the red cell membrane) and the participants were divided into O3I tertile groups: T1 < 5.47%, T2 = 5.47-6.75%, T3 > 6.75%. Potential confounding factors of BMI, inflammatory status (C-reactive Protein), physical activity (total MET-min/wk), alpha1-acid glycoprotein, serum ferritin and hemoglobin, were assessed. Data reported as z-scores (mean ± SD), analyses via ANOVA and ANCOVA.Two hundred ninety-nine women (26.9 ± 5.4 y) completed the study (O3I data, n = 288). The ANOVA showed no overall group differences but a significant group × cognition domain interaction (p < 0.01). Post hoc tests showed that participants in the low O3I tertile group scored significantly lower on attention than the middle group (p = 0.01; ES = 0.45 [0.15-0.74]), while the difference with the high group was borderline significant (p = 0.052; ES = 0.38 [0.09-0.68]). After confounder adjustments, the low group had lower attention scores than both the middle (p = 0.01) and high (p = 0.048) groups. These findings were supported by univariate analyses which found significant group differences for the attention domain only (p = 0.004).Cognitive function in the attention domain was lower in women with lower O3I, but still within normal range. This reduced but normal level of cognition potentially provides a lower baseline from which cognition would decline with age. Further investigation of individuals with low n-3 PUFA status is warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691091>Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) versus whole-breast external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in early stage breast cancer: results from SEER database.</a></h1><p>Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) has emerged as an alternative to whole-breast external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for early breast cancer. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for survival after IORT or whole-breast EBRT in breast cancer patients.Breast cancer patients undergoing IORT or whole-breast EBRT were included from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database. Risk factors for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were identified by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.The IORT and EBRT groups did not differ significantly in OS and CSS. T2 stage (tumor size > 2 cm) was associated with poorer OS (aHR 3.49, 95% CI 1.05-11.62, P = 0.042), whereas ER-positive tumors were associated with better OS (aHR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09-0.76, P = 0.014).IORT was not inferior than EBRT considering the OS and CSS in the short-term follow-up of early breast cancer. It may be a reasonable alternative to EBRT for early breast cancer in select patients with favorable tumor size and receptor status, given the need for long-term monitoring of local control and radiation toxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694512>Changes in the  of Sphingoid Bases in the Brain and Spinal Cord of Transgenic FUS(1-359) Mice, a Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the content of sphingoid bases - sphingosine (SPH), sphinganine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPH-1-P) - and in expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in their  in the brain structures (hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum) and spinal cord of transgenic FUS(1-359) mice. FUS(1-359) mice are characterized by motor impairments and can be used as a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Lipids from the mouse brain structures and spinal cord after 2, 3, and 4 months of disease development were analyzed by chromatography/mass spectrometry, while changes in the expression of the SPHK1, SPHK2, SGPP2, SGPL1, ASAH1, and ASAH2 genes were assayed using RNA sequencing. The levels of SPH and sphinganine (i.e., sphingoid bases with pronounced pro-apoptotic properties) were dramatically increased in the spinal cord at the terminal stage of the disease. The ratio of the anti-apoptotic SPH-1-P to SPH and sphinganine sharply reduced, indicating massive apoptosis of spinal cord cells. Significant changes in the content of SPH and SPH-1-P and in the expression of genes related to their  were found at the terminal ALS stage in the spinal cord. Expression of the SGPL gene (SPH-1-P lyase) was strongly activated, while expression of the SGPP2 (SPH-1-P phosphatase) gene was reduced.

Acetate is a short chain fatty acid derived from AA oxidation, and acetate levels were significantly higher in urine collected overnight with food provided  compared with urine collected after 9 h fasting. Feeding increases gastrointestinal blood flow, and thus, we explored the direct effects of AA (and acetate) in isolated murine superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Over the concentration range of 1-100 mM, AA strongly, and reversibly relaxed agonist-induced contractions of SMA including phenylephrine (PE), thromboxane A analog (U46,619) and high potassium (High K) without toxicity. The sensitivity (EC) but not the efficacy (>90% relaxation of PE-precontraction) of AA-induced relaxations was dependent on blood vessel (SMA was 3× more sensitive than aorta) and contractile agonist (PE EC = 3.3 ± 0.4 mM; U46,619 EC = 14.9 ± 1.5 mM; and High K EC = 17.7 ± 0.5 mM) yet independent of circadian cycle and sex. The most sensitive component of the AA-induced relaxation was inhibited significantly by: (1) a mechanically impaired endothelium; (2) nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor (L-NAME); and (3) a guanylyl cyclase (GC) inhibitor (ODQ). Both acetate and EtOH stimulated much weaker relaxations in SMA than did AA, yet these relaxations were significantly inhibited by L-NAME as well. Neither EtOH nor acetate relaxed pre-contracted aorta. Although neither cyanamide, a non-specific aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme inhibitor, nor Alda-1, a specific activator of ALDH2 activity, had any effect on either sensitivity or efficacy of AA-induced relaxation in SMA, cyanamide significantly blocked both EtOH- and acetate-induced relaxations in SMA implicating a role of ALDH activity in vasorelaxation. These data show that AA relaxes SMA via an endothelium- and NO-dependent mechanism indicating that AA may be one component of the complex post-prandial hyperemia reflex via vasodilatation of mesenteric vasculature.Copyright © 2019 Jin, Lorkiewicz, Malovichko, Bhatnagar, Srivastava and Conklin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695197>Lipid signalling drives proteolytic rewiring of mitochondria by YME1L.</a></h1><p>Reprogramming of mitochondria provides cells with the  flexibility required to adapt to various developmental transitions such as stem cell activation or immune cell reprogramming, and to respond to environmental challenges such as those encountered under hypoxic conditions or during tumorigenesis. Here we show that the i-AAA protease YME1L rewires the proteome of pre-existing mitochondria in response to hypoxia or nutrient starvation. Inhibition of mTORC1 induces a lipid signalling cascade via the phosphatidic acid phosphatase LIPIN1, which decreases phosphatidylethanolamine levels in mitochondrial membranes and promotes proteolysis. YME1L degrades mitochondrial protein translocases, lipid transfer proteins and  enzymes to acutely limit mitochondrial biogenesis and support cell growth. YME1L-mediated mitochondrial reshaping supports the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells as spheroids or xenografts. Similar changes to the mitochondrial proteome occur in the tumour tissues of patients with PDAC, suggesting that YME1L is relevant to the pathophysiology of these tumours. Our results identify the mTORC1-LIPIN1-YME1L axis as a post-translational regulator of mitochondrial proteostasis at the interface between  and mitochondrial dynamics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691326>Pumping new life into old ideas: Preservation and rehabilitation of the liver using ex situ machine perfusion.</a></h1><p>Recent advances in machine perfusion technology have reinvigorated the field of liver transplantation with the possibilities of vastly improving the efficiency and safety of the life-saving procedure. With this improved preservation technology, transplant surgeons are now able to use previously untransplantable donor livers without significantly compromising patient outcomes. Early clinical studies demonstrate the ability to extend preservation times and assess a graft's potential viability using normothermic machine perfusion, in addition to restoring the energy supply in donor livers by supporting  through circulation of vital nutrients and blood-based oxygen carriers. Future endeavors for surgeons and scientists should focus on improving criteria to assess viability, optimizing protocols for perfusion research, investigating mechanisms of poor graft viability, and targeting these mechanisms with novel therapies to improve graft function prior to transplantation. Long-term goals include extending preservation times on the scale of days to weeks, enabling long-distance organ sharing, and establishing regional organ perfusion centers to streamline the procurement, perfusion, and transplantation process.© 2019 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694276>Computed and Subjective Blue Scleral Color Analysis as a Diagnostic Tool for Iron Deficiency: A Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutritional deficiency. ID diagnosis requires ferritin measurement because clinical findings are poor and nonspecific. We studied the diagnostic value of blue sclera, which was scarcely reported as a specific and sensitive sign of ID. We enrolled 74 patients suspected of having ID. Pictures of their eyes were taken using a smartphone under similar daylight conditions. Three independent physicians graded the scleral color, and a computer analysis yielded the blue percentile of the sclera image. Final analysis included 67 patients (mean age 59.9 ± 20.1 years). Fifty-one had ID. Subjective blue scleral color was associated with ID for physician 1 (64.5% vs. 86.1%,  = 0.03). Sensitivity was 60.8% (CI95: 46.1%; 74.2%), specificity 68.8% (CI95: 41.3%; 89%), and positive predictive value 86.1% (CI95: 70.5%; 95.3%). A marginal difference was observed for other physicians ( = 0.05). Computer analysis showed higher blue in the ID group ( = 0.04). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.7 (0.54; 0.85). Sensitivity was 78.4% (CI95: 63.7%; 88.7%), specificity was 50% (CI95: 24.7%; 75.3%). Assessment of blue sclera was not influenced by iris color, sex, or anemia. We showed that blue sclera has good positive predictive value for ID diagnosis, and computer analysis was correlated to clinical assessment. Improvement of this innovative, non-invasive method could provide an easy handling and inexpensive diagnosis tool for ID.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693096>The Autophagy-Related Protein GABARAP Is Induced during Overwintering in the Bean Bug (Hemiptera: Alydidae).</a></h1><p>In most insects dependent on food resources that deplete seasonally, mechanisms exist to protect against starvation. Insects overcome periods of food depletion using diapause-associated physiological mechanisms, such as increased energy resources in fat bodies and suppression of . Because autophagy supplies energy resources through the degradation of intracellular components, we hypothesized that it might be an additional strategy to combat starvation during overwintering. In this study, we measured the abundance of the proteins involved in the signaling pathway of autophagy during overwintering in adults of the bean bug Riptortus pedestris (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Alydidae), which must withstand the periodic depletion of its host plants from late fall to early spring. Although the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) markedly increased after the cessation of food supply, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and target of rapamycin (TOR) were not found to be associated with food depletion. Thus, food depletion appears to induce autophagy independent of AMPK and TOR. The GABARAP levels significantly increased universally when the food supply ceased, irrespective of the diapause status of adults and low-temperature conditions. In overwintering diapause adults under seminatural conditions, the GABARAP levels significantly increased during early spring. Thus, autophagy appears to assist the survival of the bean bugs under natural conditions of food deficiency.© The Author(s) 2019.

Overall, our results showed that genotype distribution of MTHFR rs4846048 and rs4845882 polymorphisms was not different between HCC patients and controls. MTHFR rs9651118 and rs1801133 loci were protective factors for HCC (rs9651118: CT vs. TT: adjusted OR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.49-0.90, P=0.008 and TC/CC vs. TT: adjusted OR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.53-0.93, P=0.015; rs1801133: GA vs. GG: adjusted OR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.97, P=0.031, AA/GA vs. GG: adjusted OR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.57-0.99, P=0.045).

Despite the presence of several inhibitors, Hh signaling cannot be controlled exclusively due to their poor efficacy and the lack of a suitable delivery system to the injury site. Therefore, it is rationale to develop new potent Hh inhibitors and suitable delivery carriers.  Based on the structure and activity of Hh inhibitor GDC-0449, we replaced its sulfonamide group with two methylpyridine-2yl at amide nitrogen to synthesize MDB5. We compared the Hh pathway inhibition and anti-fibrotic effect of MDB5 with GDC-0449 in vitro. Next, we developed MDB5 loaded micelles using our methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-blockpoly(2-methyl-2-carboxyl-propylene carbonate-graft-dodecanol (PEG-PCC-g-DC) copolymer and characterized for physicochemical properties. We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of MDB5 loaded micelles in common bile duct ligation (CBDL) induced liver fibrosis, mouse model. We also determined the intrahepatic distribution of fluorescently labeled micelles after MDB5 treatment.  Our results show that MDB5 was more potent in inhibiting Hh pathway components and HSC proliferation in vitro. We successfully developed MDB5 loaded micelles with particle size of 40 ± 10 nm and drug loading up to 10% w/w. MDB5 loaded micelles at the dose of 10 mg/kg were well tolerated by mice, without visible sign of toxicity. The serum enzyme activities elevated by CBDL was significantly decreased by MDB5 loaded micelles compared to GDC-0449 loaded micelles. MDB5 loaded micelles further decreased collagen deposition, HSC activation, and Hh activity and its target genes in the liver. MDB5 loaded micelles also prevented liver sinusoidal endothelial capillarization (LSEC) and therefore restored perfusion between blood and liver cells.  Our study provides evidence that MDB5 was more potent in inhibiting Hh pathway in HSC-T6 cells and showed better hepatoprotection in CBDL mice compared to GDC-0449.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690825> and biogeochemical consequences of viral infection in aquatic ecosystems.</a></h1><p>Ecosystems are controlled by 'bottom-up' (resources) and 'top-down' (predation) forces. Viral infection is now recognized as a ubiquitous top-down control of microbial growth across ecosystems but, at the same time, cell death by viral predation influences, and is influenced by, resource availability. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the biogeochemical impact of viruses, focusing on how  reprogramming of host cells during lytic viral infection alters the flow of energy and nutrients in aquatic ecosystems. Our synthesis revealed several emerging themes. First, viral infection transforms host , in part through virus-encoded  genes; the functions performed by these genes appear to alleviate energetic and biosynthetic bottlenecks to viral production. Second, viral infection depends on the physiological state of the host cell and on environmental conditions, which are challenging to replicate in the laboratory. Last,  reprogramming of infected cells and viral lysis alter nutrient cycling and carbon export in the oceans, although the net impacts remain uncertain. This Review highlights the need for understanding viral infection dynamics in realistic physiological and environmental contexts to better predict their biogeochemical consequences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693486>GLP-1 signaling is required for improvement of glucose tolerance by osteocalcin.</a></h1><p>Osteocalcin is a bone-derived hormone that in its uncarboxylated form (GluOC) plays an important role in glucose and energy  by stimulating insulin secretion and pancreatic β-cell proliferation through its putative receptor GPRC6A. We previously showed that the effect of GluOC on insulin secretion is mediated predominantly by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) released from intestinal endocrine cells in response to GluOC stimulation. Moreover, oral administration of GluOC was found to reduce the fasting blood glucose level, to improve glucose tolerance, and to increase the fasting serum insulin concentration and β-cell area in the pancreas in wild-type mice. We have now examined the effects of oral GluOC administration for at least 4 weeks in GLP-1 receptor knockout mice. Such administration of GluOC in the mutant mice triggered glucose intolerance, enhanced gluconeogenesis, and promoted both lipid accumulation in the liver as well as adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation in adipose tissue. Furthermore, inactivation of GLP-1 receptor signaling in association with GluOC administration induced activation of the transcription factor FoxO1 and expression of its transcriptional coactivator PGC1α in the liver, likely accounting for the observed up-regulation of gluconeogenic gene expression. Our results thus indicate that the beneficial  effects of GluOC are dependent on GLP-1 receptor signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691520>Control of solvent production by sigma-54 factor and the transcriptional activator AdhR in Clostridium beijerinckii.</a></h1><p>Clostridia are obligate anaerobic bacteria that can produce solvents such as acetone, butanol and ethanol. Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) play a key role in solvent production; however, their regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we characterized the regulatory mechanisms of two ADH-encoding genes in C. beijerinckii. SigL (sigma factor σ ) was found to be required for transcription of adhA1 and adhA2 genes. Moreover, a novel transcriptional activator AdhR was identified, which binds to the σ promoter and activates σ -dependent transcription of adhA1 and adhA2. Clostridia beijerinckii mutants deficient in SigL or AdhR showed severely impaired butanol and ethanol production as well as altered acetone and butyrate synthesis. Overexpression of SigL resulted in significantly improved solvent production by C. beijerinckii when butyrate was added to cultures. Our results reveal SigL as a novel engineering target for improving solvent production by C. beijerinckii and other solvent-producing clostridia. Moreover, this study gains an insight into regulation of alcohol  in diverse clostridia.© 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we demonstrate that epidermal growth factor-like 9 (EGFL9) is significantly upregulated in basal-like breast cancer cells and associated with metastatic progression in breast tumor samples. Functionally, EGFL9 is both necessary and sufficient to enhance cancer cell migration and invasion, as well as distant metastasis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that EGFL9 binds cMET, activating cMET-mediated downstream signaling. EGFL9 and cMET co-localize at both the cell membrane and within the mitochondria. We further identify an interaction between EGFL9 and the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly factor COA3. Consequently, EGFL9 regulates COX activity and modulates cell , promoting a Warburg-like  phenotype. Finally, we show that combined pharmacological inhibition of cMET and glycolysis reverses EGFL9-driven stemness. Our results identify EGFL9 as a therapeutic target for combating metastatic progression in TNBC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693336>Computationally-Guided Discovery and Experimental Validation of Indole-3-Acetic Acid Synthesis .</a></h1><p>Elucidating the interaction  associated with secondary metabolite production in microorganisms is an ongoing challenge made all the more daunting by the rate at which DNA sequencing technology reveals new genes and potential . Developing the culturing methods, expression conditions, and genetic systems needed for validating  in newly discovered microorganisms is often not possible. Therefore, new tools and techniques are needed for defining complex  . Here we describe an in vitro computationally-assisted pathway description approach that employs bioinformatic searches of genome databases, protein structural modeling, and protein-ligand docking simulations to predict the gene products most likely to be involved in a particular secondary metabolite production pathway. This information is then used to direct in vitro reconstructions of the pathway and subsequent confirmation of pathway activity using crude enzyme preparations. As a test system, we elucidated the pathway for biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in the plant-associated microbe Pantoea sp. YR343. This organism is capable of metabolizing tryptophan into the plant phytohormone IAA. BLAST analyses identified a likely three-step pathway involving an amino transferase, an indole pyruvate decarboxylase, and a dehydrogenase. However, multiple candidate enzymes were identified at each step, resulting in a large number of potential pathway reconstructions (32 different enzyme combinations). Our approach shows the effectiveness of crude extracts to rapidly elucidate enzymes leading to functional . Results are compared to affinity purified enzymes for select combinations and found to yield similar relative activities. Further, in vitro testing of the pathway reconstructions revealed the "underground" nature of IAA  in Pantoea sp. YR343 and the various mechanisms used to produce IAA. Importantly, our experiments illustrate the scalable integration of computational tools and cell-free enzymatic reactions to identify and validate   in a broadly applicable manner.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693487>The P450 side chain cleavage enzyme Cyp11a2 facilitates steroidogenesis in zebrafish.</a></h1><p>The cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme, encoded by the CYP11A1 gene, catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of steroid hormone biosynthesis. Previous morpholino knockdown studies in zebrafish suggested cyp11a2 is a functional equivalent of human CYP11A1 and is essential for interrenal steroidogenesis in zebrafish larvae. The role of Cyp11a2 in adult zebrafish, particularly in gonadal steroidogenesis, remains elusive. To explore the role of Cyp11a2 in adults, we developed zebrafish mutant lines by creating deletions in cyp11a2 using the CRISPR/Cas9 genomic engineering approach. Homozygous mutant zebrafish larvae showed an upregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis. Furthermore, Cyp11a2-deficient zebrafish demonstrated profound glucocorticoid and androgen deficiencies. Cyp11a2 homozygotes only developed into males with feminized secondary sex characteristics. Adult cyp11a2-/- mutant fish showed a lack of natural breeding behaviors. Histological characterization revealed disorganized testicular structure and significantly decreased numbers of mature spermatozoa. These findings are further supported by the downregulation of the expression of several pro-male genes in the testes of cyp11a2 homozygous zebrafish, including sox9a, dmrt1 and amh. Moreover, the spermatogonia markers nanos2 and piwil1 were upregulated, while the spermatocytes marker sycp3 and spermatids marker odf3b were downregulated in the testes of cyp11a2 homozygous mutants. Our expression analysis is consistent with our histological studies, suggesting that spermatogonia are the predominant cell types in the testes of cyp11a2 homozygous mutants. Our work thus demonstrates the crucial role of Cyp11a2 in interrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis in zebrafish larvae and adults.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693691>Association between serum homocysteine level and cognitive function in middle-aged type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.</a></h1><p>Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is strongly associated with various complications, including cognitive impairment. Diabetic complication is related with structural and functional changes of brain. Studies investigated that homocysteine as an independent risk factor of several organ complications. This marker might have a role in pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in T2DM patients. We aimed to know the association between serum homocysteine level and cognitive impairment in middle-aged T2DM populations. The study was a cross-sectional study involving 97 T2DM patients aged <60 years old. Cognitive assessment was based on validated Indonesian version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-INA) test. Besides, serum homocysteine level (Hcy) was measured based on standard laboratory assay. Filling out the questionnaire of MoCA-INA was conducted when patients came to take the blood sample. This study used independent t-test, chi-square and multivariate logistic regression model to analyze the data. There were 47 subjects (48.5%) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Delayed recall was the most impaired domain (94.8%). There was no significant mean difference of serum Hcy level in MCI and non-MCI group (11.99±3.27 μmol/L vs 12.36±4.07 μmol/L respectively, p = 0.62). Final model of logistic regression showed no association between serum Hcy and cognitive function after adjusting confounding variables (OR: 1.778; 95%CI: 0.69-4.54). Further investigation involving slight elderly T2DM patients with larger sample size should be conducted to confirm this finding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693915>Light emitting diode (LED) photobiomodulation therapy on murine macrophage exposed to Bothropstoxin-I and Bothropstoxin-II myotoxins.</a></h1><p>The light-emitting diode (LED) is considered a therapeutic tool due to its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and wound-healing effects, which occur through angiogenesis, decrease in IL-1β and IL-6 secretion, and acceleration of the cicatricial process. Snakebites are an important public health problem in tropical regions of the world. LED treatment is a therapeutic tool associated with serum therapy used to minimize the local effects of snakebites, including decrease in creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations, myonecrosis, and inflammatory and haemorrhagic responses. In this study, we analysed the photobiomodulation effect of LED on the activation of murine macrophages induced by BthTX-I or BthTX-II isolated from Bothrops jararacussu venom. Photobiomodulation caused an increase in mitochondrial  and a considerable decrease in cytotoxicity in murine macrophages. Moreover, it induced a decrease in reactive oxygen species and nitrogen liberation. However, photobiomodulation caused an increase in macrophage phagocytic capacity and lipid droplet formation. The results of this study corroborated with those of others in an unprecedented way and provide a better understanding of the mechanism of action of photobiomodulation, besides offering a coadjuvant action treatment for the local effects of snakebites, not achieved with serum therapy alone.Copyright © 2019.

Similar to many other FPR2 agonistic peptides, nanomolar concentrations of both PSMα2 and PSMα3 activate neutrophils to increase the cytosolic concentration of Ca and release NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species. In addition, the PSMα peptides induce FPR2 homologous desensitization, actin polymerization, and neutrophil reactivation through a receptor cross-talk mechanism. However, in contrast to conventional FPR2 agonistic peptides, including the host-derived formyl peptide MCT-ND4, we found that the PSMα peptides lacked the ability to recruit β-arrestin and induce neutrophil chemotaxis, supporting the previous notion that β-arrestin translocation is of importance for cell migration. Despite the lack of β-arrestin recruitment, the PSMα peptides induced an FPR2-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and internalization. Furthermore, structure-activity relationship analysis with PSMα2 derivatives revealed critical roles of the first 3 aa linked to N-fMet as well as the C terminus of PSMα2 in promoting FPR2 to recruit β-arrestin. In summary, our data demonstrate a novel neutrophil activation pattern upon FPR2 sensing of PSMα peptides, signified by the ability to induce increased intracellular Ca, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, internalization, and NADPH oxidase activity, yet lack of β-arrestin recruitment and neutrophil chemoattraction. These novel features adopted by the PSMα peptides could be of importance for  virulence and might facilitate identification of new therapeutic strategies for treating  infections.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690987>Association of genetic variants related to plasma fatty acids with type 2 diabetes mellitus and glycaemic traits: a Mendelian randomisation study.</a></h1><p>Epidemiological data on the associations of circulating fatty acid levels with type 2 diabetes are inconsistent. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomisation study to explore the causal associations of plasma levels of ten fatty acids with type 2 diabetes and glycaemic traits.Thirteen SNPs associated with circulating levels of ten individual fatty acids at the genome-wide significance level (p < 5 × 10) were selected as instrumental variables for the exposures. For the outcomes, summary-level data were obtained from the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) consortium for type 2 diabetes (898,130 individuals) and from the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) for the glycaemic traits (up to 46,186 non-diabetic individuals). The inverse-variance weighted method was used for analyses.Genetic predisposition to higher plasma levels of eight of the ten fatty acids were statistically significantly associated with lower or higher odds of type 2 diabetes. The OR per one SD increment of each fatty acid was 0.93 (95% CI 0.90, 0.96; p = 2.21 × 10) for α-linolenic acid, 0.96 (95% CI 0.94, 0.98; p = 1.85 × 10) for linoleic acid, 0.86 (95% CI 0.81, 0.91; p = 6.68 × 10) for palmitoleic acid, 0.87 (95% CI 0.81, 0.93; p = 2.21 × 10) for oleic acid, 1.08 (95% CI 1.03, 1.12; p = 0.002) for eicosapentaenoic acid, 1.04 (95% CI 1.02, 1.07; p = 0.001) for docosapentaenoic acid, 1.03 (95% CI 1.02, 1.05; p = 2.51 × 10) for arachidonic acid and 1.09 (95% CI 1.03, 1.15; p = 0.003) for stearic acid.

However, the associations, except that for palmitoleic acid, were driven by variants in FADS1/2, which encode enzymes with a key role in fatty acid .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694288>Intermediate-Salinity Systems at High Altitudes in the Peruvian Andes Unveil a High Diversity and Abundance of Bacteria and Viruses.</a></h1><p>Intermediate-salinity environments are distributed around the world. Here, we present a snapshot characterization of two Peruvian thalassohaline environments at high altitude, Maras and Acos, which provide an excellent opportunity to increase our understanding of these ecosystems. The main goal of this study was to assess the structure and functional diversity of the communities of microorganisms in an intermediate-salinity environment, and we used a metagenomic shotgun approach for this analysis. These Andean hypersaline systems exhibited high bacterial diversity and abundance of the phyla , , , and ; in contrast,  from the phyla , , and  were identified in low abundance. Acos harbored a more diverse prokaryotic community and a higher number of unique species compared with Maras. In addition, we obtained the draft genomes of two bacteria,  and , as well as the viral genomes of  lambda-like phage and -like phage and 27 partial novel viral halophilic genomes. The functional metagenome annotation showed a high abundance of sequences associated with detoxification, DNA repair, cell wall and capsule formation, and nucleotide ; sequences for these functions were overexpressed mainly in bacteria and also in some archaea and viruses. Thus, their  profiles afford a decrease in oxidative stress as well as the assimilation of nitrogen, a critical energy source for survival.

Little is known about related clinical and demographic components contributing to these differences. We examined differences in HbA between adults who have T2DM with and without major depression. T-tests and chi-square analyses measured differences in HbA and clinical/demographic variables. HbA was statistically higher in depressed participants compared to non-depressed participants. The difference was no longer statistically significant after controlling for age. Age and HbA were negatively correlated across the sample and were still correlated in each group independently. The interaction of age and HbA was moderated by depression status. Additionally, mechanisms for diabetes severity differences were assessed using moderation analyses and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition technique. Seventy-four percent of the mean outcome HbA difference between depressed and non-depressed diabetic participants was explained by age. Furthermore, age was negatively correlated with clinical variables, such as diastolic blood pressure and cholesterol. Comparing age to smoking and nonsmoking participants, smokers were statistically younger. Younger adults with T2DM may require more attention regarding self-management, particularly in the context of depression. Depression should be screened and treated among individuals with diabetes since this exacerbates diabetes severity.This article is protected by copyright.

The use of cytarabine and doxorubicin in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) along with voriconazole can potentially alter the  of the drugs and cause some interactions. In this study, we presented a case of AML who received cytarabine and doxorubicin as a chemotherapy regimen and voriconazole as a prophylactic anti-fungal.

Recent advances reveal that it is a key transcriptional regulator of genes, broadly involved in xenobiotic and drug  and also cancers of gastrointestinal tract. However, the exact functional roles of HNF4α in prostate cancer progression are still not fully understood. In this study, we determined the functional significance of HNF4α in prostate cancer. Our results showed that HNF4α exhibited a reduced expression pattern in clinical prostate cancer tissues, prostate cancer cell lines and xenograft model of castration-relapse prostate cancer. Stable HNF4α knockdown not only could promote cell proliferation and suppress doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells, but also confer resistance to paclitaxel treatment and enhance colony formation capacity and in vivo tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells. On the contrary, ectopic overexpression of HNF4α could significantly inhibit the cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells, induce cell-cycle arrest at G/M phase and trigger the cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells by activation of p21 signal pathway in a p53-independent manner via its direct transactivation of CDKN1A. Together, our results show that HNF4α performs a tumor suppressor function in prostate cancer via a mechanism of p21-driven cellular senescence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696666>Combined effects of growth hormone and testosterone replacement treatment in heart failure.</a></h1><p>Although preliminary studies have demonstrated safety and effectiveness of single replacement therapy for growth hormone deficiency or testosterone deficiency in heart failure (HF), no data are available regarding the combined treatment with both GH and T in this setting. Thus, the aim of the present hypothesis generating pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of multiple hormonal replacement therapies in chronic HF.Five stable HF with reduced ejection fraction patients, with a concomitant diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency and testosterone deficiency, on top of guideline-based HF treatment underwent 1 year of GH replacement therapy by subcutaneous injections of somatotropin at a dose of 0.012 mg/kg every second day. After 12 months, a T replacement treatment was added at a dosage of 1000 mg every 3 months. Each patient underwent a complete M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic examination, and an incremental symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test on a bicycle ergometer at baseline (BL), after 1 year of GH treatment (V1), and after 1 year of combined GH + T treatments (V2). One-year of GH treatment resulted in a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (+5.4%, P < 0.01), New York Heart Association functional class (P < 0.05), and peak oxygen consumption (VO peak) (+19.3%, P < 0.01), and in a significant reduction in NT-proBNP levels (-35.1%, P < 0.01). Notably, one additional year of combined GH and T replacement therapy induced a further increase in VO peak (+27.7%, final delta change + 52.44%, P < 0.01), as well as a significant improvement in muscular strength, as assessed by handgrip dynamometry (+17.5%, final delta change + 25.8%, P < 0.01). These beneficial effects were paralleled with an improvement of the overall clinical status (as assessed by New York Heart Association class). Of note, neither adverse effects nor cardiovascular events were reported during the follow-up period.Our preliminary data suggest for the first time that combined replacement therapy with GH and T could be considered safe and therapeutic in HF patients with multiple hormone deficiencies, supporting the hypothesis that multiple hormone deficiencies syndrome can be considered as a novel and promising therapeutic target in HF. Further studies with a more robust design and larger population are needed.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we studied the role of ouabain (specific Na,K-ATPase ligand) and AMP-activated protein kinase (key regulator of muscle ) in the maintenance of muscle electrogenesis; the levels of these endogenous factors are directly related to the motor activity. After 4-day intraperitoneal administration of ouabain (1 µg/kg daily), a hyperpolarization of sarcolemma was registered in isolated rat diaphragm muscles due to an increase in the electrogenic activity of Na,K-ATPase. In acute experiments, addition of nanomolar ouabain concentrations to the bathing solution resulted in the muscle membrane hyperpolarization within 15 min. The effect of ouabain reversed to membrane depolarization with the increase in the external potassium concentration. It is possible that Na,K-ATPase activation by ouabain may be regulated by such factors as specific subcellular location, interaction with molecular partners, and changes in the ionic balance. Preventive administration of the AMP-activated protein kinase activator AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside; 400 mg/kg body weight daily for 7 days) in chronic experiments resulted in the stabilization of the endplate structure and abolishment of depolarization of the rat soleus muscle membrane caused by the motor activity cessation.

Most of the previous studies were focused on the expression of cytokines, and few studies were analyzed from the perspective of metabolomics. Therefore, it is worthy to conduct researches on allergic rhinitis at the  level. The purpose of this study was to identify differential serum biomarkers by metabolomics. In this study, the OPLS-DA model was applied to characterize the differences of the serum samples between AR patients and healthy volunteers. A total of 10 metabolites (except hexadecanoic acid) have been found to alter significantly (p < 0.05) by the principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), which could be the potential biomarkers. MetaboAnalyst 4.0 and pathway enrichment analysis showed that these metabolite changes mainly involved three : porphyrin and chlorophyll , arachidonic acid  and purine .

Relative mRNA expression levels of the Asah2, Crot, Crtc2, Fmo3, GSTA2, LOC1009122026, LOC102551184, NpY, NqO1, Prom1, Retsat, RGD1305464, Tmem104, and Whsc1 genes were also determined by RT-qPCR. All the tested diets affected differently the key   (KEGGs). Significant changes in the expression of steroid  gene were observed in the liver of animals fed with the tested diets (except the high-fat high fructose diet). Both high-fat and high-fructose diets caused a significant decrease in the expression of squalene synthase (FDFT1 gene) responsible for the initial stage of cholesterol synthesis. On the contrary, in animals fed with the high-cholesterol diet (0.5% cholesterol), expression of the FDFT1 gene did not differ from the control group; however, these animals were characterized by changes in the expression of glucose and glycogen synthesis genes, which could lead to the suppression of glycogen synthesis and gluconeogenesis. At the same time, this group demonstrated different liver tissue morphology in comparison with the animals fed with the high-fructose high-fat diet, manifested as the presence of lipid vacuoles of a smaller size in hepatocytes. The high-fructose and high-fructose high-fat diets affected the   associated with intracellular protein catabolism (endocytosis, phagocytosis, proteasomal degradation, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum), tight junctions and intercellular contacts, adhesion molecules, and intracellular RNA transport. Rats fed with the high-fructose high-fat or high-cholesterol diets demonstrated consistent changes in the expression of the Crot, Prom1, and RGD1305464 genes, which reflected a coordinated shift in the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692944>Potential for therapeutic use of hydrogen sulfide in oxidative stress-induced neurodegenerative diseases.</a></h1><p>Oxidative phosphorylation is a source of energy production by which many cells satisfy their energy requirements. Endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of oxidative phosphorylation. ROS are formed due to the inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and lead to oxidative stress that affects mitochondrial . Chronic oxidative stress contributes to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The immediate consequences of oxidative stress include lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) mutation, which induce neuronal cell death. Mitochondrial binding of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein has been identified as a contributing factor in AD. In PD and HD, respectively, α-synuclein (α-syn) and huntingtin (Htt) gene mutations have been reported to exacerbate the effects of oxidative stress. Similarly, abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics and the respiratory chain occur in ALS due to dysregulation of mitochondrial complexes II and IV. However, oxidative stress-induced dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases can be mitigated by the antioxidant function of hydrogen sulfide (HS), which also acts through the potassium (K/K) ion channel and calcium (Ca) ion channels to increase glutathione (GSH) levels. The pharmacological activity of HS is exerted by both inorganic and organic compounds. GSH, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) neutralize HO-induced oxidative damage in mitochondria. The main purpose of this review is to discuss specific causes and effects of mitochondrial oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, and how these are impacted by the antioxidant functions of HS to support the development of advancements in neurodegenerative disease treatment.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693870>Parental morphine exposure affects repetitive grooming actions and marble burying behavior in the offspring: Potential relevance for obsessive-compulsive like behavior.</a></h1><p>Family, adoption and twin studies have highlighted the significant role of heritable influences on individual differences in opioid addiction. Meanwhile, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder wherein the individual experiences recurring thoughts that cause irrational fears and anxiety. In the present study, adult male and female rats received morphine solution for 21 days and were drug-free for 10 days. Offspring were used in 4 distinct groups; (1) paternal morphine-exposed, (2) maternal morphine-exposed, (3) maternal and paternal morphine-exposed, and (4) drug-naïve subjects. We assessed the grooming behavior and marble burying test as an indicator of obsessive-compulsive behavior. To clarify the mechanisms underlying these changes, the mRNA level of BDNF, the phosphorylation level of CREB and the protein level of D2 dopamine receptor (DR) were evaluated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The grooming behavior in male offspring with one or two morphine-abstinent parent(s) increased compared with the offspring of drug naïve rats. In addition, the offspring of morphine-exposed parents buried more marbles when compared with the offspring of drug-naïve parents. Also, the BDNF mRNA was down-regulated in the NAC. However, the levels of phospho-CREB and D2 DR were elevated. Previous studies indicated that exposure to morphine in adulthood enhances the risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring. OCD is one the comorbid disorders with addiction and increases the risk of substance abuse disorder in patients. In this survey, we found that morphine exposure in parents before gestation can encourage obsessive-compulsive behavior in offspring.Copyright © 2019.

Current evidence demonstrated that this canonical mechanism is evolutionary conserved. Thus, recent data demonstrated that inhibition of AMPKα2 in fish hypothalamus led to decreased food intake and liver capacity to use and synthesize glucose, lipid, and amino acid. We hypothesize that a signal of abundance of nutrients from the hypothalamus controls hepatic . The vagus nerve is the most important link between the brain and the liver. We therefore examined in the present study whether surgical transection of the vagus nerve in rainbow trout is sufficient to alter the effect in liver of central inhibition of AMPKα2. Thus, we vagotomized (VGX) or not (SHAM) rainbow trouts, and then intracerebroventricularly administered adenoviral vectors tagged with GFP alone or linked to a dominant negative isoform of AMPKα2 (AMPKα2-DN). The inhibition of AMPKα2 led to a reduced food intake in parallel with changes in the mRNA abundance of hypothalamic neuropeptides () involved in food intake regulation. Central inhibition of AMPKα2 resulted in liver in decreased capacity of use and synthesis of glucose, lipid, and amino acid. Notably, these effects mostly disappeared in VGX fish. These results support that the autonomic nervous system actions mediates the actions of hypothalamic AMPKα2 on liver . Importantly, this evidence indicates that the well-established role of hypothalamic AMPK on energy balance is a canonical evolutionary preserved mechanism that appeared at least in the fish lineage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691493>The fungal community and its interaction with the concentration of short-chain fatty acids in the faeces of Chenghua, Yorkshire and Tibetan pigs.</a></h1><p>Despite their important roles in host nutrition and , and potential to cause disease, our knowledge of the fungal community in the mammalian gut is quite limited. To date, diversity and composition of fungi in swine gut still remains unknown. Therefore, the first internal transcribed spacer of fungi in faecal samples from three breeds of pigs (10 pigs for each breed) was sequenced based on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, and the relationship between the fungal community and the concentrations of main short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was also analysed. Results indicated that Chenghua (local, higher body fat rate), Yorkshire (foreign, higher lean meat and growth rate) and Tibetan (plateau, stronger disease resistance) pigs harboured distinct fungal community. The Basidiomycota and Ascomycota presented as the two predominant phyla, with Loreleia, Russula and Candida as the top three genera in all samples. Network analysis revealed a total of 35 correlations among different fungal genera, with 27 (77.14%) positive and 8 (22.86%) negative pairwise interactions. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that fungi in the faeces of pigs were more correlated to the concentration of acetate and butyrate rather than propionate. Spearman's correlation further showed that Tomentella was positively correlated to both acetate and butyrate, and Loreleia was positively correlated to propionate (P < 0.05), while Nephroma and Taiwanofungus were negatively correlated to acetate and propionate (P < 0.05). These findings expanded our knowledge on the intestinal fungi in pigs with different genotypes and phenotypes, indicating that fungi may play an indispensable role during the  of host and the maintenance of intestinal health. The cross-feeding between fungi and other microorganisms may be crucial during the digestion of dietary carbohydrates and the associated physiological processes, which is worthy to be further studied.© 2019 The Authors.

Sigma1 (encoded by the  gene and also known as Sigma-1 receptor, S1R) is a unique pharmacologically regulated integral membrane chaperone or scaffolding protein that allosterically modulates the activity of its associated proteins. Sigma2, recently identified as transmembrane protein 97 (TMEM97), is an integral membrane protein implicated in cellular cholesterol homeostasis. A number of publications over the past two decades have suggested a role for both sigma proteins in tumor biology. Although there is currently no clinically used anti-cancer drug that targets Sigma1 or Sigma2/TMEM97, a growing body of evidence supports the potential of small-molecule compounds with affinity for these proteins, putative sigma ligands, as therapeutic agents to treat cancer. In preclinical models, these compounds have been reported to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, and migration; furthermore, they have been demonstrated to suppress tumor growth, to alleviate cancer-associated pain, and to exert immunomodulatory properties. Here, we will address the known knowns and the known unknowns of Sigma1 and Sigma2/TMEM97 ligand actions in the context of cancer. This review will highlight key discoveries and published evidence in support of a role for sigma proteins in cancer and will discuss several fundamental questions regarding the physiological roles of sigma proteins in cancer and sigma ligand mechanism of action.Copyright © 2019 Oyer, Sanders and Kim.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694927>Reproducing human and cross-species drug toxicities using a Liver-Chip.</a></h1><p>Nonclinical rodent and nonrodent toxicity models used to support clinical trials of candidate drugs may produce discordant results or fail to predict complications in humans, contributing to drug failures in the clinic.

To achieve their clinical potential, it is critical for PSCs to maintain genomic stability during the extended proliferation. The critical tumor suppressor p53 is required to maintain genomic stability of mammalian cells. In response to DNA damage or oncogenic stress, p53 plays multiple roles in maintaining genomic stability of somatic cells by inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence to prevent the passage of genetic mutations to the daughter cells. p53 is also required to maintain the genomic stability of PSCs. However, in response to the genotoxic stresses, a primary role of p53 in PSCs is to induce the differentiation of PSCs and inhibit pluripotency, providing mechanisms to maintain the genomic stability of the self-renewing PSCs. In addition, the roles of p53 in cellular  might also contribute to genomic stability of PSCs by limiting oxidative stress.

Accordingly, we generated and analyzed adipocyte-specific nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase () knockout (ANKO) and brown adipocyte-specific  knockout (BANKO) mice because NAMPT is the rate-limiting NAD biosynthetic enzyme. We found ANKO mice, which lack NAMPT in both BAT and WAT, had impaired gene programs involved in thermogenesis and mitochondrial function in BAT and a blunted thermogenic (rectal temperature, BAT temperature, and whole-body oxygen consumption) response to acute cold exposure, prolonged fasting, and administration of β-adrenergic agonists (norepinephrine and CL-316243). In addition, the absence of NAMPT in WAT markedly reduced adrenergic-mediated lipolytic activity, likely through inactivation of the NAD-SIRT1-caveolin-1 axis, which limits an important fuel source fatty acid for BAT thermogenesis. These  abnormalities were rescued by treatment with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which bypasses the block in NAD synthesis induced by NAMPT deficiency. Although BANKO mice, which lack NAMPT in BAT only, had BAT cellular alterations similar to the ANKO mice, BANKO mice had normal thermogenic and lipolytic responses. We also found  expression in supraclavicular adipose tissue (where human BAT is localized) obtained from human subjects increased during cold exposure, suggesting our finding in rodents could apply to people. These results demonstrate that adipose NAMPT-mediated NAD biosynthesis is essential for regulating adaptive thermogenesis, lipolysis, and whole-body energy .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695754>Treatment patterns of drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a retrospective cohort study using a Japanese hospital database.</a></h1><p>Guidelines for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management in Japan provide physicians the discretion to select treatment options based on patient pathophysiology of the disease. There exists a wide variation of preference for initial antidiabetes drugs (AD). The current database analysis aimed to understand the real world treatment patterns in drug-naive patients with T2DM in Japan.We analyzed data of patients (≥ 18 years) diagnosed with T2DM between October 2012 and September 2016 from the Medical Data Vision, a Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. The primary objective was to determine the proportion of T2DM patients receiving each type of treatment as first-line therapy among the drug-naive cohort.Of the 436,546 drug-naive patients, 224,761 received their first-line T2DM treatment in the outpatient setting. The mean age of the patient population was 65.6 years at index date. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor was the most prescribed (56.8%) outpatient AD monotherapy, followed by metformin (15.4%). DPP-4 inhibitors were prescribed over metformin in patients with renal disease (odds ratio [OR]: 4.20; p < 0.0001), coronary heart disease and stroke (OR: 2.22; p < 0.0001). Male (OR: 1.03; p = 0.0026), presence of diabetic complications [retinopathy (OR: 1.33; p < 0.0001), neuropathy (OR: 1.05; p = 0.0037), nephropathy (OR: 1.08; p < 0.0001)] and a high baseline HbA1c (OR: 1.45; p < 0.0001) received treatment intensification during 180 days.DPP-4 inhibitors were the most prevalent first-line T2DM treatment followed by metformin in Japan. The findings from this retrospective analysis also support the previously published web survey results and can help understand the real world utilization of T2DM treatment.

Germline mutations in the ATM gene cause Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), characterized by cerebellar ataxia and cancer predisposition. Whether ATM deficiency impacts on tumor initiation or also on the maintenance of the malignant state is unclear. Here, we show that Atm reactivation in initially Atm-deficient B- and T cell lymphomas induces tumor regression. We further find a reduced T cell abundance in B cell lymphomas from Atm-defective mice and A-T patients. Using T cell-specific Atm-knockout models, as well as allogeneic transplantation experiments, we pinpoint impaired immune surveillance as a contributor to cancer predisposition and development. Moreover, we demonstrate that Atm-deficient T cells display impaired proliferation capacity upon stimulation, due to replication stress. Altogether, our data indicate that T cell-specific restoration of ATM activity or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may prevent lymphomagenesis in A-T patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695782>Thymopentin ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis by triggering the production of IL-22 in both innate and adaptive lymphocytes.</a></h1><p> Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, notoriously challenging to treat. Previous studies have found a positive correlation between thymic atrophy and colitis severity. It was, therefore, worthwhile to investigate the effect of thymopentin (TP5), a synthetic pentapeptide corresponding to the active domain of the thymopoietin, on colitis.  Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice were treated with TP5 by subcutaneous injection. Body weight, colon length, colon weight, immune organ index, disease activity index (DAI) score, and the peripheral blood profile were examined. The immune cells of the spleen and colon were analyzed by flow cytometry. Histology was performed on isolated colon tissues for cytokine analysis. Bacterial DNA was extracted from mouse colonic feces to assess the intestinal microbiota. Intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs), HCT116, CT26, and splenocytes were cultured and treated with TP5.  TP5 treatment increased the body weight and colon length, decreased the DAI score, and restored colon architecture of colitic mice. TP5 also decreased the infiltration of immune cells and expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Importantly, the damaged thymus and compromised lymphocytes in peripheral blood were significantly restored by TP5. Also, the production of IL-22, both in innate and adaptive lymphoid cells, was triggered by TP5. Given the critical role of IL-22 in mucosal host defense, we tested the effect of TP5 on mucus barrier and gut microbiota and found that the number of goblet cells and the level of Mucin-2 expression were restored, and the composition of the gut microbiome was normalized after TP5 treatment. The critical role of IL-22 in the protective effect of TP5 on colitis was further confirmed by administering the anti-IL-22 antibody (αIL-22), which completely abolished the effect of TP5. Furthermore, TP5 significantly increased the expression level of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (RORγt), a transcription factor for IL-22. Consistent with this, RORγt inhibitor abrogated the upregulation of IL-22 induced by TP5.  TP5 exerts a protective effect on DSS-induced colitis by triggering the production of IL-22 in both innate and adaptive lymphocytes. This study delineates TP5 as an immunomodulator that may be a potential drug for the treatment of UC.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692562>K-means clustering of overweight and obese population using quantile-transformed  data.</a></h1><p>Use of K-means clustering for big data technology to cluster an overweight and obese population metabolically.K-means clustering with the help of quantile transformation of attribute values was applied to overcome the impact of the considerable variation in the values of obesity attributes involving outliers and skewed distribution.Overall, 447 subjects were categorized into six clusters; metabolically normal, mild, and severe categories. There were clearly separated metabolically normal Cluster 1 and severe Cluster 2, as well as intermediate Cluster 3, 4, and 5 that had profiles of fewer attributes with abnormal values. Cluster 3 was characteristic of sole hypertension. Cluster 3 and 4 exhibited contrasting HDL-C and LDL-C levels despite similarly elevated total cholesterol. Cluster 6 with slightly elevated triglyceride was closest to the normal group. Four- and 10-quantile-transformations yielded consistent clustering results. Compared with the original data, the quantile-transformed data produced more regular and spherical clusters and evenly distributed clusters in terms of object numbers.This big data analysis strategy makes use of quantile-transformation of data to overcome the issue of outliers and the irregular distribution and applies to the analysis of other non-communicable diseases.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693244>Effects of Alendronic Acid on Fracture Healing.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696328>Correction to: Extreme Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk Recognition.</a></h1><p>The original version of this article unfortunately contained a mistake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692172>The vasodilator oxyfedrine inhibits aldehyde  and thereby sensitizes cancer cells to xCT-targeted therapy.</a></h1><p>The major cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) protects cancer cells from oxidative damage that can lead to the induction of ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death triggered by the aberrant accumulation of lipid peroxides. Inhibitors of the cystine-glutamate antiporter subunit xCT, which mediates the uptake of extracellular cystine and thereby promotes GSH synthesis, are thus potential anticancer agents. On the other hand, the efficacy of xCT-targeted therapy has been found to be diminished by  reprogramming that affects redox status in cancer cells. The identification of drugs for combination with xCT inhibitors that are able to overcome resistance to xCT-targeted therapy might thus provide the basis for effective cancer treatment. We have now identified the vasodilator oxyfedrine (OXY) as a sensitizer of cancer cells to GSH-depleting agents including the xCT inhibitor sulfasalazine (SSZ). OXY contains a structural motif required for covalent inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes, and combined treatment with OXY and SSZ was found to induce accumulation of the cytotoxic aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal and cell death in SSZ-resistant cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Microarray analysis of tumor xenograft tissue revealed cyclooxygenase-2 expression as a potential biomarker for the efficacy of such combination therapy. Furthermore, OXY-mediated ALDH inhibition was found to sensitize cancer cells to GSH depletion induced by radiation therapy in vitro. Our findings thus establish a rationale for repurposing of OXY as a sensitizing drug for cancer treatment with agents that induce GSH depletion.© 2019 The Authors.

Then, the gene sequences of phenylacetyl-CoA ligase (PCL), a key enzyme for the PAA pathway, were searched in reference genomes. The widespread distribution of PCL genes among 14.9% of archaea and 75.9% of Thermoprofundales further supports the importance of the PAA pathway in archaea, particularly in Thermoprofundales where no ring-cleavage dioxygenases were found. Two PCLs from Thermoprofundales MAGs, PCL and PCL , were able to convert PAA to phenylacetyl-CoA (PA-CoA) in vitro, demonstrating the involvement of Thermoprofundales in aromatics degradation through PAA via CoA activation. Their acid tolerance (pH 5-7), high optimum temperatures (60°C and 80°C), thermostability (stable at 60°C and 50°C for 48h), and broad substrate spectra imply that Thermoprofundales are capable of transforming aromatics under extreme conditions. Together with the evidence of in situ transcriptional activities for most genes related to the aromatics pathway in Thermoprofundales, these genomic, and biochemical evidences highlight the essential role of this ubiquitous and abundant archaeal order in the carbon cycle of marine sediments.

Hallmarks of aggressive tumors such as a decrease in extracellular pH (pH) can potentially be used to identify aggressive phenotypes. In this study, we employ an optimized, high signal-to-noise ratio hyperpolarized (HP) C pH imaging method to discriminate between indolent and aggressive disease in a murine model of prostate cancer. Transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice underwent a multiparametric MR imaging exam, including HP [C] bicarbonate MRI for pH, with H apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping and HP [1-C] pyruvate MRI to study lactate . Tumor tissue was excised for histological staining and qRT-PCR to quantify mRNA expression for relevant glycolytic enzymes and transporters. We observed good separation in pH between low- and high-grade tumor regions, with high-grade tumors demonstrating a lower pH. The pH also correlated strongly with monocarboxylate transporter  gene expression across all tumors, suggesting that lactate export via MCT4 is associated with acidification in this model. Our results implicate extracellular acidification as an indicator of indolent-to-aggressive transition in prostate cancer and suggest feasibility of HP pH imaging to detect high-grade, clinically significant disease in men as part of a multiparametric MRI examination.Copyright: © 2019 Korenchan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693425>An up-to-date evaluation of lorcaserin hydrochloride for the treatment of obesity.</a></h1><p>: Obesity is a chronic disease caused by dysfunctional neurohormonal systems that result in excess weight, adiposopathy, and increased risk for many comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.

Baseline blood samples were collected >1 hour before race. Serial post-race blood sampling time points included immediately (0hr), 1 hour (1hr), 1 day (d), 3 d, and 5 d after the Ironman race.Serum muscle damage markers, serum myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) revealed significant post-race peak values immediately, 1hr and 1d after the race, respectively. Except for the marginally higher serum CK and myoglobin at 5d (P=0.01~0.05), all post-race serum levels of muscle damage markers were significantly higher than baseline levels (P<0.01). Serum phosphorus values were significantly higher immediately (0hr) after the Ironman race.

Any condition (environmental, pharmacological/toxicological, physical, or neuro-humoral) that changes the vascular endothelium has great consequences for the organism's wellness and on the outcome and evolution of severe cardiovascular pathologies. Thus, knowledge of the mechanisms, both endogenous and external, that affect endothelial dysfunction is pivotal to preventing and treating these disorders. In recent decades, significant attention has been focused on gut microbiota and how these symbiotic microorganisms can influence host health and disease development. Indeed, dysbiosis has been reported to be at the base of a range of different pathologies, including pathologies of the cardiovascular system. The study of the mechanism underlying this relationship has led to the identification of a series of metabolites (released by gut bacteria) that exert different effects on all the components of the vascular system, and in particular on endothelial cells. The imbalance of factors promoting or blunting endothelial cell viability and function and angiogenesis seems to be a potential target for the development of new therapeutic interventions.

Under this scenario, organisms should maintain or develop strategies to cope with environmental fluctuations, such as the capacity to modify growth trajectories. However, altering growth can have negative consequences for organisms' fitness. Here, we investigated the  alterations induced by compensatory growth during the larval development of the common frog (Rana temporaria), quantifying changes in oxidative stress, corticosterone levels, and telomere length. We induced compensatory growth responses by exposing frog embryos to cold conditions (i.e. a "false spring" scenario), which cause a delay in hatching. Once hatched, we reared larvae at two different photoperiods (24:0, representing the natural photoperiod of larvae, and 18:6) to test also for the interactive effects of light on growth responses. Larvae experiencing delayed-hatching showed fast compensatory responses, and reached larger size at metamorphosis. Larvae shortened their developmental period in response to delayed-hatching. Non-permanent light conditions resulted in relaxed growth compared with larvae reared under permanent light conditions, which grew at their natural photoperiod and closer to their maximal rates. Growth responses altered the redox status and corticosterone levels of larvae. These physiological changes were developmental-stage dependent, and mainly affected by photoperiod conditions. At catch-up, larvae reared at 18:6 light:dark cycles showed higher antioxidant activities and glucocorticoid secretion. On the contrary, larvae reared at 24:0 developed at higher rates without altering their oxidative status, likely an adaptation to grow under very restricting seasonal conditions at early life. At metamorphosis, compensatory responses induced higher cellular antioxidant activities probably caused by enhanced . Telomeres length remained unaltered by experimental treatments but apparently tended to elongate across larval ontogeny, which would be a first evidence of telomere lengthening across metamorphosis. Under the forecasted increase in extreme climatic events, adjusting growth and developmental rates to the dynamics of environmental fluctuations may be essential for survival, but it can carry  costs and affect later performance. Understanding the implications of such costs will be essential to properly estimate the impact of climate change on wild animals.© 2019 The Authors.

H. polymorpha Pex37 is a peroxisomal membrane protein, which belongs to a protein family that includes among others the Neurospora crassa Woronin body protein Wsc, the human peroxisomal membrane protein PXMP2, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial inner membrane protein Sym1 and its mammalian homologue MPV17. We show that deletion of H. polymorpha PEX37 does not appear to have a significant effect on peroxisome biogenesis or proliferation in cells grown at peroxisome inducing growth conditions (methanol). However, the absence of Pex37 results in a reduction in peroxisome numbers and a defect in peroxisome segregation in cells grown at peroxisome repressing conditions (glucose). Conversely, overproduction of Pex37 in glucose-grown cells results in an increase in peroxisome numbers in conjunction with a decrease in their size. The increase in numbers in PEX37 overexpressing cells depends on the dynamin related protein Dnm1. Together our data suggest that Pex37 is involved in peroxisome fission in glucose-grown cells. Introduction of human PXMP2 in H. polymorpha pex37 cells partially restored the peroxisomal phenotype, indicating that PXMP2 represents a functional homologue of Pex37. H. polymorpha pex37 cells did not show aberrant growth on any of the tested carbon and nitrogen sources that are metabolized by peroxisomal enzymes, suggesting that Pex37 may not fulfill an essential function in transport of these substrates or compounds required for their  across the peroxisomal membrane.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691192>Association Between Thyroid Hormone Status and Trace Elements in Serum of Patients with Nodular Goiter.</a></h1><p>The present study investigated the status of calcium and magnesium as well as essential trace elements including iodine, selenium, copper, iron, and zinc in adults residing in the Zhytomyr region of Ukraine. In addition, the relative risk of goiter occurrence was evaluated. In this comparative study, 40 adults without goiter (control group) and 16 adults with diagnosed nodular goiter (NG) were examined. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used for the measurements of Mg, Ca, Se, Zn, Cu, and Fe in serum of patients with NG and control group. Patients with nodular goiter had lower serum values of Ca, Mg, Se, Cu, Fe, and Zn than those in the control group. The presence of mild iodine deficiency was evident in both groups with the median urinary iodine excretion (UIE) 80.5 μg/L in the control group and 64.5 μg/L in goiter group. There was a positive association between goiter presence and low concentration of Ca in serum (odds ratio (OR) = 2.29 (1.26-3.55), p < 0.05) in the NG group. High relative risk of goiter was observed at low concentrations of magnesium (OR = 3.33 (1.39-7.62), p < 0.05) and selenium (OR = 1.63, (1.16-1.78), p < 0.05) in comparison with OR values in the control group. Low concentrations of Ca, Mg, Zn, and Se in serum combined with reduced UIE resulted in the highest risk of goiter (OR = 12.5, (2.15-79.42), p < 0.01). This study proved that Thyroglobulin concentration in serum is the reliable indicator of nodular goiter. We also suggest that a combination of low concentrations of Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu, and Se in blood serum, and reduced iodine concentration in urine resulted in the highest risk of nodular goiter development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695492>Berberine induces apoptosis in non-small-cell lung cancer cells by upregulating miR-19a targeting tissue factor.</a></h1><p>Berberine (BBR) from the widely used Chinese herbal medicine Huanglian has an array of pharmacological and biochemical properties, including anti-neoplastic activity.

Two-Years' Experience in Catalonia (Spain).</a></h1><p>Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), the most severe form of T-cell immunodeficiency, can be screened at birth by quantifying T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) in dried blood spot (DBS) samples. Early detection of this condition speeds up the establishment of appropriate treatment and increases the patient's life expectancy. Newborn screening for SCID started in January 2017 in Catalonia, the first Spanish and European region to universally include this testing. The results obtained in the first 2 years of experience are evaluated here. All babies born between January 2017 and December 2018 were screened. TREC quantification in DBS (1.5 mm diameter) was performed with the Enlite Neonatal TREC kit from PerkinElmer (Turku, Finland). In 2018, the retest cutoff in the detection algorithm was updated based on the experience gained in the first year, and changed from 34 to 24 copies/μL. This decreased the retest rate from 3.34 to 1.4% (global retest rate, 2.4%), with a requested second sample rate of 0.23% and a positive detection rate of 0.02%. Lymphocyte phenotype (T, B, NK populations), expression of CD45RA/RO isoforms, percentage and intensity of TCR αβ and TCR γδ, presence of HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes, and  lymphocyte proliferation were studied in all patients by flow cytometry. Of 130,903 newborns screened, 30 tested positive, 15 of which were male. During the study period, one patient was diagnosed with SCID: incidence, 1 in 130,903 births in Catalonia. Thirteen patients had clinically significant T-cell lymphopenia (non-SCID) with an incidence of 1 in 10,069 newborns (43% of positive detections). Nine patients were considered false-positive cases because of an initially normal lymphocyte count with normalization of TRECs between 3 and 6 months of life, four infants had transient lymphopenia due to an initially low lymphocyte count with recovery in the following months, and three patients are still under study. The results obtained provide further evidence of the benefits of including this disease in newborn screening programs.

The gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, after which its product was purified and characterized. The expressed enzyme was highly thermostable and retained about 90% of its activity after incubation for 10 min at temperatures up to 90°C. Two different crystal structures of P. aerophilum GalT were determined: the substrate-free enzyme at 2.33 å and the UDP-bound H140F mutant enzyme at 1.78 å. The main-chain coordinates of the P. aerophilum GalT monomer were similar to those in the structures of the E. coli and human GalTs, as was the dimeric arrangement. However, there was a striking topological difference between P. aerophilum GalT and the other two enzymes. In the E. coli and human enzymes, the N-terminal chain extends from one subunit into the other and forms part of the substrate-binding pocket in the neighboring subunit. By contrast, the N-terminal chain in P. aerophilum GalT extends to the substrate-binding site in the same subunit. Amino acid sequence alignment showed that a shorter surface loop in the N-terminal region contributes to the unique topology of P. aerophilum GalT. Structural comparison of the substrate-free enzyme with UDP-bound H140F suggests that binding of the glucose moiety of the substrate, but not the UDP moiety, gives rise to a large structural change around the active site. This may in turn provide an appropriate environment for the enzyme reaction. This article is protected by copyright.

Metabolomics studies in humans and diverse mouse populations have revealed associations between diet-derived gut bacterial metabolites, including trimethylamine-N-oxide, short-chain fatty acids, and intermediates of aromatic amino acid breakdown, with progression of CVD. Functional studies in animals fed diets of defined composition have been instrumental for establishing causal links between these metabolites, the microbes that produce them, dietary substrates and disease. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent progress in our understanding of how gut microbial  of food influences the development of CVD and to outline experimental approaches that can be useful for addressing crucial knowledge gaps in the field. Together, this body of work supports the notion that the gut microbiomes mediate many of the effects of diet.Copyright © 2019.

The human Golgi Anti-Apoptotic Protein (hGAAP, also known as TMBIM4) is a highly conserved Golgi cation channel that modulates intracellular Ca fluxes. Human GAAP is expressed in all human tissues, is essential for cell viability and provides resistance against a range of apoptotic stresses. Furthermore, hGAAP enhances adhesion and cell migration by increasing the turnover of focal adhesions due to activation of store-operated Ca entry. Here, we describe a GA-derived mechanism that controls cell invasion. The overexpression of hGAAP stimulates 3-dimensional proteolytic cell invasion by a mechanism that is dependent on the accumulation of intracellular hydrogen peroxide which might be produced by the hGAAP-dependent stimulation of mitochondrial respiration. These findings provide new insight into the complex mechanisms by which Ca and reactive oxygen species signaling contribute to cell invasion and to the role of the GA in these processes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Participants were randomized between two sequences (placebo followed by MCT or MCT followed by placebo) and took MCT jelly or placebo jelly (canola oil) by mouth three times daily (total daily fat dose: 17.3 g MCT, or 19.7 g canola oil) for 30 days per phase. The primary outcome was cognition as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, Chinese version (ADAS-Cog-C). The secondary outcome was self-care as measured by the activities of daily living scale (ADL) and changes in plasma metabolites.This study showed a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in ADAS-Cog-C scores between the MCT (2.62 points below baseline) and placebo interventions (2.57 points above baseline). Data from 46 (86.8%) APOE4 subjects who completed the entire study were analyzed. Changes in ADL scores were not significantly different between the MCT and placebo interventions (p > 0.05). The concentrations of TC, HDL-C, β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate were significantly higher in the MCT group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05). Lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0 (LysoPC (16:0)), LysoPC (P-18:0), LysoPC (P-18:1(9Z)), LysoPC (20:2(11Z,14Z)), and LysoPC (22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)) were significantly increased after MCT intervention, and the concentrations of LysoPC (18:0), palmitic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene were significantly decreased (p < 0.05), whereas no significant changes appeared after the placebo intervention. Androstenedione concentration increased after placebo intervention. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was observed between changes in LysoPC (P-18:1(9Z)) and ADAS-Cog-C scores after MCT intervention (r = -0.1472, p < 0.05).MCT had positive effects on cognitive ability in mild to moderate AD patients with APOE4. These effects of MCT might be related to the  of LysoPC, oleic acid, linoleic acid and palmitic acid, in addition to the ketogenic effect.ChiCTR-IOR-16009737.WHO ICTRP Search Portal - http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and .

Hence, it poses a risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of  syndrome increases with age. Nesfatin-1, which affects different systems, has recently been discovered as a regulatory peptide molecule. With the discovery of nesfatin-1, it has been reported to inhibit the intake of nutrients and have significant regulatory effects on energy . As nesfatin-1 is present in both central and peripheral tissues, it is thought to have many functions. In addition to its suppressive effect on food intake, nesfatin-1 has also been reported to have an effect on the blood glucose level for regulating cardiac functions and affecting obesity by providing weight loss.

Here, the association between CXC chemokine receptors (CXCR2-5) and prognosis in osteosarcoma was studied.Differences between CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, and CXCR5 expression and overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses. The associations of CXCR3 expression with clinical features and the prognosis were also analyzed. The signaling  modulated by CXCR3 were investigated. The correlations between CXCR3 and immune infiltrates were investigated.The expression of CXCR2, CXCR4, and CXCR5 was not associated with the prognosis, but CXCR3 low expression was correlated with worse OS and EFS of osteosarcoma, especially for female, patients aged less than 15.1 years, or patients without metastasis. Low CXCR3 expression was related to tumor site and histologic response (P&lt;0.05), but not associated with other clinical characteristics. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that CXCR3 remained independently associated with the prognosis, especially for OS (HR = 3.26, 95% CI = 1.15-9.24, P = 0.026). The cell adhesion, apoptosis, , KRAS, P53, NOTCH, reactive oxygen species (ROS), PI3K/Akt/mTOR, VEGF, inflammation, and immune-related  such as IL-6/JAK/STAT3, TNF-α via NF-κB, Toll/NOD-like receptor, and complement were modulated by CXCR3. CXCR3 expression showed an especially positive correlation with immune infiltration of T cells CD8, macrophages M1, plasma cells, and NK cells activated.CXCR3 may be an independent risk factor for the prognosis and was most likely to benefit from immunotherapy in osteosarcoma.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696211>Regulation of human 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase by pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate. Implications for Primary Hyperoxaluria Type-3.</a></h1><p>4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase (HOGA1) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a gatekeeper role in hydroxyproline . Its loss of function in humans causes primary hyperoxaluria type 3, a rare condition characterized by excessive production of oxalate. In this study we investigated the significance of the associated oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity which is also catalyzed by HOGA1. Kinetic studies using the recombinant human enzyme (hHOGA1) and active site mutants showed both these dual activities utilize the same catalytic machinery with micromolar substrate affinities suggesting that both are operative in vivo. Biophysical and structural studies showed that pyruvate was a competitive inhibitor with an inhibition constant in the micromolar range. By comparison α-ketoglutarate was a weak inhibitor with an inhibition constant in the millimolar range and could only be isolated as an adduct with the active site Lys196 in the presence of sodium borohydride. These studies suggest that pyruvate inhibits HOGA1 activity during gluconeogenesis. We also propose that loss of HOGA1 function could increase oxalate production in primary hyperoxaluria type-3 by decreasing pyruvate availability and  flux through the Krebs cycle.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692249>The Current Status and Future of Andrology: A Consensus Report from the Cairo Workshop Group.</a></h1><p>In attempting to formulate potential WHO guidelines for the diagnosis of male infertility, the Evidence Synthesis Group noted a paucity of high quality data on which to base key recommendations. As a result, a number of authors suggested that key areas of research/evidence gaps should be identified, so that appropriate funding and policy actions could be undertaken to help address key questions.The overall objective of this Consensus workshop was to clarify current knowledge and deficits in clinical laboratory andrology, so that clear paths for future development could be navigated.Following a detailed literature review, each author, prior to the face to face meeting, prepared a summary of their topic and submitted a PowerPoint presentation. The topics covered were (1) Diagnostic testing in male fertility and infertility (2) Male fertility/infertility in the modern world (3) Clinical management of male infertility and (4) The overuse of ICSI. At the meeting in Cairo on 18 February 2019 the evidence was presented and discussed and a series of consensus points agreed.The paper presents a background and summary of the evidence relating to these four topics and addresses key points of significance. Following discussion of the evidence, a total of 36 consensus points were agreed.The Discussion section presents areas where there was further debate and key areas that were highlighted during the day.The consensus points provide clear statements of evidence gaps and/or potential future research areas/topics. Appropriate funding streams addressing these can be prioritized and consequently, in the short and medium term, answers provided.

This essential interaction is globally threatened by anthropogenic disturbance. As such, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning the cnidarian-algal association. Here we investigated phosphorylation-mediated protein signaling as a mechanism of regulation of the cnidarian-algal interaction, and we report on the generation of the first phosphoproteome for the coral model organism Aiptasia. Using mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics in data-independent acquisition allowed consistent quantification of over 3,000 phosphopeptides totaling more than 1,600 phosphoproteins across aposymbiotic (symbiont-free) and symbiotic anemones. Comparison of the symbiotic states showed distinct phosphoproteomic profiles attributable to the differential phosphorylation of 539 proteins that cover a broad range of functions, from receptors to structural and signal transduction proteins. A subsequent pathway enrichment analysis identified the processes of 'protein digestion and absorption,' 'carbohydrate ,' and 'protein folding, sorting, and degradation,' and highlighted differential phosphorylation of the 'phospholipase D signaling pathway' and 'protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum.' Targeted phosphorylation of the phospholipase D signaling pathway suggests control of glutamate vesicle trafficking across symbiotic compartments, and phosphorylation of the endoplasmic reticulum machinery suggests recycling of symbiosome-associated proteins. Our study shows for the first time that changes in the phosphorylation status of proteins between aposymbiotic and symbiotic Aiptasia anemones play a role in the regulation of the cnidarian-algal symbiosis. This is the first phosphoproteomic study of a cnidarian-algal symbiotic association as well as the first application of quantification by data-independent acquisition in the coral field.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695456>Prevalence and identification of type 1 diabetes in Chinese adults with newly diagnosed diabetes.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) and classic type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in newly diagnosed adult diabetes in China.This cross-sectional study involved 17,349 newly diagnosed diabetes in adults aged ≥30 years from 46 hospitals within 31 months. Demographic characteristics, clinical features, and medical history were collected by trained researchers. T1DM as a whole was comprised of classic T1DM and LADA. Classic T1DM was identified based on the clinical phenotype of insulin-dependency, and LADA was differentiated from patients with initially an undefined diabetes type with standardized glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody testing at the core laboratory. The age and sex distributions from a large national survey of diabetes in China conducted in 2010 were used to standardize the prevalence of classic T1DM and LADA.Among 17,349 adult patients, the prevalence of T1DM was 5.49% (95% CI: 4.90-6.08%) (5.14% [95% CI: 4.36-5.92%] in males and 6.16% [95% CI: 5.30-7.02%] in females), with 65% of these having LADA. The prevalence of classic T1DM decreased with increasing age (<0.05), while that of LADA was stable (>0.05). The prevalence of T1DM in overweight or obese patients was 3.42% (95% CI: 3.20-3.64%) and 2.42% (95% CI: 1.83-3.01%), respectively, and LADA accounted for 76.5% and 79.2% in these two groups.We draw the conclusion that T1DM, especially LADA, was prevalent in newly diagnosed adult-onset diabetes in China, which highlights the importance of routine islet autoantibodies testing in clinical practice.© 2019 Tang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696229>Sigma-1 receptor is a key genetic modulator in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</a></h1><p>Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone that regulates mitochondrial respiration but also controls cellular defense against ER and oxidative stress. This makes S1R a potential therapeutic target in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Especially, as a missense mutation E102Q in S1R has been reported in few familial ALS cases. However, the pathogenicity of S1RE102Q and the beneficial impact of S1R in the ALS context remain to be demonstrated in vivo. To address this, we generated transgenic Drosophila that express human wild-type S1R or S1RE102Q. Expression of mutant S1R in fly neurons induces abnormal eye morphology and locomotor defects in a dose-dependent manner. This was accompanied by abnormal mitochondrial fragmentation, reduced ATP levels and a higher fatigability at the neuromuscular junction during high energy demand. Overexpressing IP3 receptor or glucose transporter mitigates the S1RE102Q-induced eye phenotype, further highlighting the role of calcium and energy  in its toxicity. More importantly, we showed that wild-type S1R rescues locomotor activity and ATP levels of flies expressing the key ALS protein, TDP43. Moreover, overexpressing wild-type S1R enhances resistance of flies to oxidative stress. Therefore, our data provide the first genetic evidence that mutant S1R recapitulates ALS pathology in vivo while increasing S1R confers neuroprotection against TDP43 toxicity.© The Author(s) 2019.

The reader will additionally get an understanding of ketamine's complex  with emphasis on the metabolite hydroxynorketamine.: Proof of sustained, large effects of ketamine in the treatment of NP from randomized controlled clinical trials is lacking, although we cannot exclude selective ketamine efficacy in patients with central sensitization, opioid-induced hyperalgesia or opioid tolerance. Interestingly, data from observational trials and case series do suggest efficacy of ketamine in producing effective pain relief in NP with positive patient-related outcome measures. Additional randomized trials in often ill-defined groups of chronic pain patients are not useful and we suggest to conduct future studies in NP patients with central sensitization and/or with opioid refractory severe NP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694629>A machine-learning approach to predict postprandial hypoglycemia.</a></h1><p>For an effective artificial pancreas (AP) system and an improved therapeutic intervention with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), predicting the occurrence of hypoglycemia accurately is very important. While there have been many studies reporting successful algorithms for predicting nocturnal hypoglycemia, predicting postprandial hypoglycemia still remains a challenge due to extreme glucose fluctuations that occur around mealtimes. The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of easy-to-use, computationally efficient machine-learning algorithm to predict postprandial hypoglycemia with a unique feature set.We use retrospective CGM datasets of 104 people who had experienced at least one hypoglycemia alert value during a three-day CGM session. The algorithms were developed based on four machine learning models with a unique data-driven feature set: a random forest (RF), a support vector machine using a linear function or a radial basis function, a K-nearest neighbor, and a logistic regression. With 5-fold cross-subject validation, the average performance of each model was calculated to compare and contrast their individual performance. The area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the F1 score were used as the main criterion for evaluating the performance.In predicting a hypoglycemia alert value with a 30-min prediction horizon, the RF model showed the best performance with the average AUC of 0.966, the average sensitivity of 89.6%, the average specificity of 91.3%, and the average F1 score of 0.543. In addition, the RF showed the better predictive performance for postprandial hypoglycemic events than other models.In conclusion, we showed that machine-learning algorithms have potential in predicting postprandial hypoglycemia, and the RF model could be a better candidate for the further development of postprandial hypoglycemia prediction algorithm to advance the CGM technology and the AP technology further.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695251>Molecular and Pathological Events Involved in the Pathogenesis of Diabetes-Associated Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus is a rising epidemic in most part of the world and is often associated with multiple organ disorders such as kidney, liver, and cardiovascular diseases.

Although obesity is a known risk factor for NAFLD, individuals with normal body mass index (BMI) also have hepatic fatty infiltration, now termed "lean-NAFLD". It represents a distinct entity with a strong underlying genetic component. The present study aimed to sequence the complete exonic regions of individuals with lean-NAFLD to identify germline causative variants associated with disrupted hepatic fatty acid , thereby conferring susceptibility to NAFLD.Whole blood was collected from patients with lean-NAFLD (n = 6; BMI < 23.0 kg/m) and matched lean controls (n = 2; discovery set). Liver fat was assessed using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging. Patients with ultrasound-detected NAFLD (n = 191) and controls (n = 105) were part of validation set. DNA was isolated, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in the discovery cohort (Ion Proton™; Ion AmpliSeq™ Exome RDY Kit). Data were analyzed (Ion Reporter software; Life Technologies), and variants identified. Validation of variants was carried out (Taqman probes; Real time-PCR). Student's t test and Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the statistical significance.Although WES identified ∼74,000 variants in individual samples, using various pipelines. variants in genes namely phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) and oxysterol-binding protein-related protein10 (OSBPL10) that have roles in dietary choline intake and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, respectively, were identified (discovery set). Furthermore, significant differences were noted in BMI (p = 0.006), waist/hip circumference (p > 0.001), waist/hip ratio (p > 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (p > 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (p > 0.001), and triglycerides (p = 0.002) between patients and controls. Validation of variants (rs7946-PEMT and rs2290532-OSBPL10) revealed that variant in PEMT but not OSBPL10 gene was associated (p = 0.04) with threefold increased risk of NAFLD in lean individuals.Our results demonstrate the association of rs7946 with lean-NAFLD.

In addition to triggering insulin secretion, glucose-induced signal regulates β-cell proliferation and survival. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of glucose on the β-cell functionality still remains unclear. Glucokinase, a hexokinase isozyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose, acts as the glucose sensor in the β-cells. To investigate the mechanisms of glucose signaling in the regulation of β-cell functions, we analyzed the role of glucokinase in insulin secretion, β-cell proliferation and β-cell apoptosis, using β-cell-specific glucokinase-haploinsufficient (Gck+/-) mice and allosteric glucokinase activators (GKAs). Glucokinase-mediated glucose  (1) suppresses endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced β-cell apoptosis via inducing insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) expression and expression of ER stress-related molecules, (2) promotes adaptive β-cell proliferation through activation of the Forkhead Box M1 (FoxM1)/polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1)/centromere protein-A (CENP-A) pathway, (3) induces islet inflammation by promoting interaction of islet-derived S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) with macrophages, (4) induces the expression of Fibulin-5 (Fbln5), an extracellular matrix protein to regulate β-cell functions, and (5) activates other unknown .

We explored methylation changes in the peripheral blood of Filipinos with T2D and identified 177 associated DMPs. Most of these DMPs were associated with genes involved in , inflammation and the cell cycle. Three of these DMPs map to the TXNIP gene body, replicating previous findings from epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of T2D. The TXNIP downmethylation coincided with increased transcription at the 3'-UTR, H3K36me3 histone markings, and Sp1 binding, suggesting spurious transcription initiation at the TXNIP 3'-UTR as a functional consequence of T2D methylation changes. We also explored potential epigenetic determinants to increased incidence of T2D in Filipino immigrants in the United States and found 3 DMPs associated with the interaction of T2D and immigration. Two of these DMPs were located near MAP 2 K7 and PRMT1, which may point towards dysregulated stress response and inflammation as a contributing factor to T2D among Filipino immigrants.© The Author(s) 2019.

The incorporation of genomic tools may help to accelerate selection. We genotyped 529 individuals using a high-density SNP chip (600 K, Affymetrix®) to estimate genomic heritability of performance traits and to identify genomic regions and their positional candidate genes associated with performance traits in a Brazilian F Chicken Resource population. Regions exhibiting selection signatures and a SNP dataset from resequencing were integrated with the genomic regions identified using the chip to refine the list of positional candidate genes and identify potential causative mutations.Feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FC), feed efficiency (FE) and weight gain (WG) exhibited low genomic heritability values (i.e. from 0.0002 to 0.13), while body weight at hatch (BW1), 35 days-of-age (BW35), and 41 days-of-age (BW41) exhibited high genomic heritability values (i.e. from 0.60 to 0.73) in this F population. Twenty unique 1-Mb genomic windows were associated with BW1, BW35 or BW41, located on GGA1-4, 6-7, 10, 14, 24, 27 and 28. Thirty-eight positional candidate genes were identified within these windows, and three of them overlapped with selection signature regions. Thirteen predicted deleterious and three high impact sequence SNPs in these QTL regions were annotated in 11 positional candidate genes related to osteogenesis, skeletal muscle development, growth, energy  and lipid , which may be associated with body weight in chickens.The use of a high-density SNP array to identify QTL which were integrated with whole genome sequence signatures of selection allowed the identification of candidate genes and candidate causal variants. One novel QTL was detected providing additional information to understand the genetic architecture of body weight traits. We identified QTL for body weight traits, which were also associated with fatness in the same population. Our findings form a basis for further functional studies to elucidate the role of specific genes in regulating body weight and fat deposition in chickens, generating useful information for poultry breeding programs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693795>A Pharmaceutical Model for the Molecular Evolution of Microbial Natural Products.</a></h1><p>Microbes are talented chemists with the ability to generate tremendously complex and diverse natural products which harbor potent biological activities. Natural products are produced using sets of specialized biosynthetic enzymes encoded by secondary  . Here, we present a two-step evolutionary model to explain the diversification of biosynthetic  that account for the proliferation of these molecules. We argue that the appearance of natural product families has been a slow and infrequent process. The first step led to the original emergence of bioactive molecules and different classes of natural products. However, much of the chemical diversity observed today has resulted from the endless modification of the ancestral biosynthetic . The second step rapidly modulates the pre-existing biological activities to increase their potency and to adapt to changing environmental conditions. We highlight the importance of enzyme promiscuity in this process, as it facilitates both the incorporation of horizontally transferred genes into secondary   and the functional differentiation of proteins to catalyze novel chemistry. We provide examples where single point mutations or recombination events have been sufficient for new enzymatic activities to emerge. A unique feature in the evolution of microbial secondary  is that gene duplication is not essential but offers opportunities to synthesize more complex metabolites. Microbial natural products are highly important for the pharmaceutical industry due to their unique bioactivities. Therefore, understanding the natural mechanisms leading to the formation of diverse   is vital for future attempts to utilize synthetic biology for the generation of novel molecules.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693781>Phosphoinositides in Autophagy: Current Roles and Future Insights.</a></h1><p>Today the importance of autophagy in physiological processes and pathological conditions is undeniable. Initially autophagy merely was described as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to maintain  homeostasis in times of starvation, however in recent years it is now apparent that autophagy is a powerful regulator of many facets of cellular , that its deregulation contributes to various human pathologies, including cancer and neurodegeneration, and its modulation has considerable potential as a therapeutic approach. Different lipid species, including sphingolipids, sterols, and phospholipids play important roles in the various steps of autophagy. In particular, there is accumulating evidence indicating the minor group of phospholipids called the phosphoinositides as key modulators of autophagy, including the signaling processes underlying autophagy initiation, autophagosome biogenesis and maturation. In this review we discuss the known functions to date of the phosphoinositides in autophagy and attempt to summarize the kinases and phosphatases that regulate them as well as the proteins that bind to them throughout the autophagy program. We will also provide examples of how the control of phosphoinositides and their metabolizing enzymes is relevant to understanding many human diseases.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694039>Glucose and Lipid  Abnormalities among Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.</a></h1><p>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent monogenic renal disease with a prevalence of 1:1,000 births and it is the 4th most common cause of dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease (ESDR). Recent reports suggest an association between APDKD and  derangements, particularly impaired glucose .In this cross-sectional study we analyzed data obtained from case records of 189 patients with ADPKD, including kidney transplant recipients, managed in an outpatient department.The mean BMI was 25.4 ± 3.9; 25.25 before and 27.7 after transplan-tation. A fasting glucose level above 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) was observed in 60 patients (29%) - 27% without transplantation and 41% kidney transplant recipients. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 17 patients (8.9%), including 3 (2.3%) without a history of transplantation and 14 (24.1%) after kidney transplantation (p < 0.01). We observed dyslipidemia in 30% and hyperuricemia in 53% of patients.Demonstrated  abnormalities should be considered in maintenance of ADPKD patients, including kidney transplant recipients.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

This study had been originally carried out as a project of a research proposed on behalf of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, from 1999 to 2004. This nationwide multicenter study on AIs included 3,672 cases with clinically diagnosed AIs, involving 1,874 males and 1,738 females, with mean age 58.1 ± 13.0 years (mean ± SD). In the present study, we focused on the investigation of the real prevalence of various adrenal disorders with AI. The mean nodule size of AI based on computed tomography was 3.0 ± 2.0 cm. Compared to non-functioning adenomas (NFAs), tumor diameters were significantly larger in adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs), pheochromocytomas, cortisol-producing adenomas (CPAs), myelolipomas, metastatic tumors, cysts, and ganglioneuromas (p < 0.01). Endocrinological evaluations demonstrated that 50.8% of total AIs were non-functioning adenomas, while 10.5%, including 3.6% with subclinical Cushing's syndrome, were reported as CPAs, 8.5% as pheochromocytomas, and 5.1% as aldosterone-producing adenomas. ACCs were accounted for 1.4% (50 cases) among our series of AIs. In conclusion, while almost 50 % of AIs are non-functional adenomas, we must be particularly careful as AIs include pheochromocytomas or adrenal carcinomas, because they may be asymptomatic. To our knowledge, this is the first and the largest investigation of AI, thus providing basic information for the establishment of clinical guidelines for the management of AI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695247>Impact of Vitamin D Status in Chronic Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common in chronic liver disease (CLD) patients. Up to 93% of these patients have some degree of vitamin D insufficiency. Liver plays an important role in the  and pleiotropic functions of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased mortality, bacterial infections, portal hypertension complications, and fibrosis severity. We aimed to determine the impact of vitamin D level in CLD.One hundred fifty individuals consisting of 75 cirrhotic patients (cases) and 75 respective attendants (controls) were enrolled between July 2015 and July 2017. A detailed clinical and laboratory evaluation was done along with estimation of vitamin D level. Unpaired t-test and analysis of variance was used to compare difference in the level of continuous variables between different groups. Linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the correlation between vitamin D deficiency and severity of liver disease.The age of patients ranged from 18 years to 69 years with mean of 48.85 ± 13.6 years in the case group and 46.57 ± 17.24 years in the control group. Out of 75 CLD patients, vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/dl) was found in 31 (41.4%) patients, out of which 14(18.7%) suffered from severe vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/ml). On applying analysis of variance test, there was significant difference in vitamin D level and serum albumin and serum bilirubin ( < 0.05). On linear regression, vitamin D level showed significant negative correlation with Child-Pugh score (r = -0.7379,  < 0.0001) and Model For End-Stage Liver Disease score (r = -0.6671,  < 0.0001).Our study concluded that CLD is associated with a significantly low level of vitamin D, which was independent to patient's gender, body mass index, residence, and education level. The findings of our study suggest that awareness of serum vitamin D level in patients with CLD is important. Further studies are required to validate the importance of vitamin D levels and impact of vitamin D supplementation on CLD.© 2019 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver.

To better understand the integrated molecular physiological effects of adipose H6PDH, we created a tissue-specific knockout of the H6PDH gene mouse model in adipocytes (H6PDHAcKO mice). H6PDHAcKO mice exhibited almost complete absence of H6PDH expression and decreased intra-adipose corticosterone production with a reduction of 11β-HSD1 activity in adipose tissue. These mice also had decreased abdominal fat mass, which was paralleled by decreased adipose lipogenic ACC and ACL gene expression and reduction of their transcription factor C/EBPα mRNA levels. Moreover, H6PDHAcKO mice also had reduced fasting blood glucose levels, increased glucose tolerance, and increased insulin sensitivity. In addition, plasma FFA levels were decreased with a concomitant decrease in the expression of lipase ATGL and HSL in adipose tissue. These results indicate that inactivation of adipocyte H6PDH expression is sufficient to cause intra-adipose GC inactivation that leads to a favorable pattern of  phenotypes. These data suggest that H6PDHAcKO mice may provide a good model for studying the potential contributions of fat-specific H6PDH inhibition to improve the  phenotype in vivo. Our study suggests that suppression or inactivation of H6PDH expression in adipocytes could be an effective intervention for treating obesity and diabetes.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695722>A Novel Compound Heterozygous  Variant Causes 17α-Hydroxylase/17, 20-Lyase Deficiency.</a></h1><p> Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) encompasses a group of autosomal recessive diseases characterized by enzyme deficiencies, within steroid hormone anabolism, which lead to disorders in cortisol synthesis. The 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency (17-OHD) is an uncommon form of CAH caused by variants in the  gene.  We report a novel compound heterozygous  variant and its association with the pathogenesis of 17-OHD.  The patient was assessed for medical history, clinical manifestations, physical examination, laboratory examination, karyotype analysis, and adrenal computed tomography. Mutation screening was conducted using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing. The wild-type and mutant  complementary DNAs (cDNAs) were amplified and cloned into a pcDNA3.1(+) vector. These plasmids were transfected transiently into HEK-293T cells. Quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis were performed to measure the expression level of P450c17. An enzymatic activity assay was conducted to measure the content of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in medium using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  The proband was characterized by 17-OHD with rhabdomyolysis, hypokalemia, and adrenal insufficiency. Novel compound heterozygous variants of the  gene (c.1304T > C/p.Phe435Ser and c.1228delG/p.Asp410Ilefs*9) were identified. The enzymatic activity assay revealed that this variant resulted in a complete deficiency of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activity. This was consistent with the hormonal characteristics of the proband's blood.  These results suggest that the compound heterozygous variant of c.1304T > C and c.1228delG of the  gene can lead to 17-OHD. Our findings thus provide a novel insight into the clinical evaluations and molecular basis of 17-OHD.Copyright © 2019 Chen, Yuan, Zhang, Jia, Chen, Zhu, Sun, Zhou, Huang, Liang, Yan and Wang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692071>Identifying men with global polyuria on a nocturnal-only voiding diary.</a></h1><p>Nocturnal polyuria (NP) and global polyuria (GP) are not mutually exclusive. However, by rate, the common criteria for GP (40 mL/kg/24 hours [117 mL/kg/hour in a 70-kg individual] or 3000 mL/24 hours [125 mL/h]) are more stringent than those for NP (90 mL/hour during the sleep period or NP index [NPi; nocturnal volume/24-hour volume] > 0.33 [no minimum rate]). It remains unclear whether total nocturnal urine volume (NUV) may reliably delineate between NP patients with and without comorbid GP.A clinical database of men with lower urinary tract symptoms was searched for voiding diaries completed by patients reporting greater than or equal to 1 nocturnal void(s). Four separate analyses were performed using all combinations of the two NP and two GP criteria listed above. For each analysis, patients were included if they met the criteria for NP, and then stratified by presence or absence of GP (ie, NP + GP vs isolated NP).Median NUV was greater among patients with NP + GP for all criteria combinations. Sensitivities greater than or equal to 80%/90%/100% for NP + GP were observed at 1275/1230/1085 mL for {NPi > 0.33 + 24-hour volume > 3000 mL}; 1075/1035/1035 mL for {NPi > 0.33 + 24-hour volume > 40 mL/kg}; 900/745/630 mL for {NUP > 90 mL/hour + 24-hour volume > 3000 mL}; and 1074/1035/990 mL for {NUP > 90 mL/hour + 24-hour volume > 40 mL/kg}.An inordinate NUV among men with NP is fairly sensitive for comorbid GP. In the appropriate clinical setting, nocturnal-only diaries may suffice in the evaluation and follow-up of patients with NP, so long as outlying nocturnal volumes prompt a 24-hour diary/urine collection.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693390>Mitochondria: at the crossroads of regulating lung epithelial cell function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</a></h1><p>Disturbances in mitochondrial structure and function in lung epithelial cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Such disturbances not only affect cellular energy , but also alter a range of indispensable cellular homeostatic functions in which mitochondria are known to be involved. These range from cellular differentiation, cell death  and cellular remodeling to physical barrier function and innate immunity, all of which are known to be impacted by exposure to cigarette smoke and have been linked to COPD pathogenesis. Next to their well-established role as the first physical frontline against external insults, lung epithelial cells are immunologically active. Malfunctioning epithelial cells with defective mitochondria are unable to maintain homeostasis and respond adequately to further stress or injury, which may ultimately shape the phenotype of lung diseases. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of cigarette smoke on the development of mitochondrial dysfunction in the lung epithelium and highlight the consequences for cell function, innate immune responses, epithelial remodeling and epithelial barrier function in COPD. We also discuss the applicability and potential therapeutic value of recently proposed strategies for the restoration of mitochondrial function in the treatment of COPD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695905>Metabolomics of exercise pulmonary hypertension are intermediate between controls and patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.</a></h1><p>Mechanisms underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remain elusive. Pulmonary arterial hypertension and exercise PH share similar physiologic consequences; it is debated whether they share biologic mechanisms and if exercise PH represents an early phase of pulmonary arterial hypertension. We conducted an observational study to test if there is a graded  disturbance along the severity of PH, which may indicate shared or disparate pathophysiology. Individuals referred to an academic medical dyspnea center with unexplained exertional intolerance underwent invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing. We identified controls with no hemodynamic exercise limitation, individuals with exercise PH (mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) < 25 mmHg at rest but ≥ 30 mmHg during exercise without pulmonary venous hypertension) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (mPAP > 25 mmHg at rest without pulmonary venous hypertension) ( = 26 in each group). Unbiased metabolomics with chromatography mass spectrometry was performed on pulmonary arterial blood at rest and peak exercise. Random forest analysis and hierarchical clustering were used to quantify metabolite prediction of group membership and rank metabolites which were significantly different between groups. Compared to controls, pulmonary arterial hypertension subjects exhibited perturbations in  involving glycolysis, TCA cycle, fatty acid and complex lipid oxidation, collagen deposition and fibrosis, nucleotide , and others. The  signature of exercise PH was uniquely between that of control and pulmonary arterial hypertension subjects. Accuracy predicting control, exercise PH, and pulmonary arterial hypertension group was 96%, 90%, and 88%, respectively, using paired rest-exercise  changes. Our data suggest the  profile of exercise PH is between that of controls and patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694170>Mouse Models of Human Claudin-Associated Disorders: Benefits and Limitations.</a></h1><p>In higher organisms, epithelia separate compartments in order to guarantee their proper function. Such structures are able to seal but also to allow substances to pass. Within the paracellular pathway, a supramolecular structure, the tight junction transport is largely controlled by the temporospatial regulation of its major protein family called claudins. Besides the fact that the expression of claudins has been identified in different forms of human diseases like cancer, clearly defined mutations in the corresponding claudin genes have been shown to cause distinct human disorders. Such disorders comprise the skin and its adjacent structures, liver, kidney, the inner ear, and the eye. From the phenotype analysis, it has also become clear that different claudins can cause a complex phenotype when expressed in different organs. To gain deeper insights into the physiology and pathophysiology of claudin-associated disorders, several mouse models have been generated. In order to model human disorders in detail, they have been designed either as full knockouts, knock-downs or knock-ins by a variety of techniques. Here, we review human disorders caused by CLDN mutations and their corresponding mouse models that have been generated thus far and assess their usefulness as a model for the corresponding human disorder.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691183>White Matter Abnormalities Linked to Interferon, Stress Response, and Energy  Gene Expression Changes in Older HIV-Positive Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy.</a></h1><p>Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) remains a significant cause of morbidity in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals despite highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). White matter abnormalities have emerged as a key component of age-related neurodegeneration, and accumulating evidence suggests they play a role in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. Viral persistence in the brain induces chronic inflammation associated with lymphocytic infiltration, microglial proliferation, myelin loss, and cerebrovascular lesions. In this study, gene expression profiling was performed on frontal white matter from 34 older HIV+ individuals on HAART (18 with NCI) and 24 HIV-negative controls. We used the NanoString nCounter platform to evaluate 933 probes targeting inflammation, interferon and stress responses, energy , and central nervous system-related genes. Viral loads were measured using single-copy assays. Compared to HIV- controls, HIV+ individuals exhibited increased expression of genes related to interferon, MHC-1, and stress responses, myeloid cells, and T cells and decreased expression of genes associated with oligodendrocytes and energy  in white matter. These findings correlated with increased white matter inflammation and myelin pallor, suggesting interferon (IRFs, IFITM1, ISG15, MX1, OAS3) and stress response (ATF4, XBP1, CHOP, CASP1, WARS) gene expression changes are associated with decreased energy  (SREBF1, SREBF2, PARK2, TXNIP) and oligodendrocyte myelin production (MAG, MOG), leading to white matter dysfunction. Machine learning identified a 15-gene signature predictive of HIV status that was validated in an independent cohort. No specific gene expression patterns were associated with NCI. These findings suggest therapies that decrease chronic inflammation while protecting mitochondrial function may help to preserve white matter integrity in older HIV+ individuals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694945>Human Cytomegalovirus Alters Host Cell Mitochondrial Function During Acute Infection.</a></h1><p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a large DNA herpesvirus that is highly prevalentin the human population. HCMV can result in severe direct and indirect pathologies under immunosuppressed conditions and is the leading cause of birth defects related to infectious disease. Currently, the effect of HCMV infection on host cell  as an increase in glycolysis during infection has been defined. We have observed that oxidative phosphorylation is also increased. We have identified morphological and functional changes to host mitochondria during HCMV infection. The mitochondrial network undergoes fission events after HCMV infection. Interestingly, the network does not undergo fusion. At the same time mitochondrial mass and membrane potential increase. The electron transport chain (ETC) functions at an elevated rate resulting in the release of increased reactive oxygen species. Surprisingly, despite the stress applied to the host mitochondria, the network is capable of responding to and meeting the increased bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands placed on it. When mitochondrial DNA is depleted from the cells, we observed severe impairment of viral replication. Mitochondrial DNA encodes many of the ETC components. These findings suggest that the host cell ETC is essential to HCMV replication. Our studies suggest the host cell mitochondria may be a therapeutic target. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus present in up to 85% of some populations. Like all herpesviruses, HCMV infection is for life. There is no vaccine currently available, neutralizing antibody therapies are ineffective and current antivirals have limited long-term efficacy due to side effects and potential for viral mutation and resistance. The significance of this research is in understanding how HCMV manipulates the host mitochondria to support bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements for replication. Despite a large genome, HCMV relies exclusively on host cells for  functions. By understanding the dependency of HCMV on the mitochondria, we could exploit these requirements and develop novel antivirals.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691815>The reactome pathway knowledgebase.</a></h1><p>The Reactome Knowledgebase (https://reactome.org) provides molecular details of signal transduction, transport, DNA replication,  and other cellular processes as an ordered network of molecular transformations in a single consistent data model, an extended version of a classic  map.
