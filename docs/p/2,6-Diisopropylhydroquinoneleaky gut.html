During the past decade, microorganisms that inhabit the  have emerged as contributors to the pathogenesis of obesity and type  diabetes. Therefore, manipulation of the human  microbiota will provide essential clues regarding new therapeutic targets for diabetes.Several studies have established the presence of  dysbiosis in patients with type  diabetes mellitus, even though there are some differences among the studies that could be explained by differences in ethnicity, diet, and methodology.  dysbiosis affects the quality and quantity of short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids that act as signaling molecules in energy, glucose, and lipid metabolism. In addition,  dysbiosis affect intestinal permeability. In particular, a high-fat diet can lead to changes in the  microbiota that strongly reduce intestinal permeability due to the malfunction of tight junction proteins, such as occludin and ZO-1 [<citeref rid="ref1">1</citeref>]. The formation of   results in increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide, which activate Toll-like receptor 4 and result in innate and adaptive immune responses [<citeref rid="ref2"></citeref>]. Key messages:  dysbiosis play an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes, for example, via chronic low-grade inflammation. Normalizing  dysbiosis could be a new approach to overcome diseases of insulin resistance, such as diabetes mellitus.© 2017 S.

High susceptibility to infections along with a significant risk for infection-related mortality justifies the description of liver cirrhosis as the world's most common immunodeficiency syndrome. Liver cirrhosis is an end-stage organic disease hallmarked by a multifaceted immune dysfunction due to deterioration of antimicrobial recognition and elimination mechanisms in macrophages along with an impaired antigen presentation ability in circulating monocytes. Bacterial translocation supports-and is supported by-uncontrolled activation of immune cell responses and/or loss of toll-like receptor (TLR) tolerance, which can turn exaggerated inflammatory responses to systemic inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin boosts systemic inflammatory activity through activation of TLR-- and TLR-4-dependent pathways and facilitate a massive production of cytokines. This, in turn, results into elevated secretion of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further enhances intestinal hyperpermeability and thus sustains a vicious circle of events widely known as " ." Albumin can be of particular benefit in cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and/or hepatorenal syndrome type of acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI) due to anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress as well as volume-expanding properties and endothelial-stabilizing attributes. However, presence of autoantibodies against albumin in patients with liver cirrhosis has been described. Although previous research suggested that these antibodies should be regarded as naturally occurring antibodies (NOA), the origin of the antialbumin immune response is obscure. High occurrence of NAO/albumin complexes in patients with liver disease might reflect a limited clearance capacity due to bypassing portal circulation. Moreover, high burden of oxidized albumin is associated with less favorable outcome in patients with liver cirrhosis. To date, there is no data available as to whether oxidized forms of albumin result in neoepitopes recognized by the immune system. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to hypothesize that these alterations may have the potential to induce antialbumin immune responses and thus favor systemic inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28738849>Immune suppression of IgG response against dairy proteins in major depression.</a></h1><p>Interactions between the digestive system, brain functions and immunoglobulin G (IgG) mediated immunity against food antigens became recently a topic of growing interest in psychiatry research. Psychological stress can activate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) with subsequent hypercortisolemia. It can also influence intestinal permeability and dynamics of IgG response. Major depression can by accompanied either by activation of inflammatory response or by immune suppression (e.g. decreased antibody production) where hypercortisolemia is a significant immune modulator. The aim of our study was to assess IgG immune response against 44 food products in depressed patients and controls along with markers of psychological stress, inflammation, psychometric and dietary parameters.Serum IgG concentrations against 44 food antigens, plasma cortisol, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1b concentrations were measured and psychometric parameters were evaluated using Hamilton Depression Rating (HAM-D 17), Perceived Stress (PSS-10), and Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) scales in 34 depressed patients and 29 controls. Dietary parameters such as frequency of exposure to food antigens, appetite and weight change were assessed.There was a significantly lower IgG concentration against dairy in depressed patients compared to controls (post hoc p < 0.05) when there was a high exposure (consumption) to dairy. Our research revealed a significant interaction of IgG concentration against dairy proteins and exposure to dairy between groups (F (.63) = 3.92, p = 0.025, η = 0.12). There was no significant difference in mean IgG concentration against food antigens between patients and controls. We found increased concentration of cortisol in depressed patients (t (1.61) = .37, p = 0.02) compared to controls. Patients with melancholic depression had significantly higher (M   = 21.27) concentration of cortisol (U = 41, p = 0.006), when compared with the non-melancholic group of patients (M   = 12.16). Cortisol concentration significantly positively correlated with HAM-D 17 (r = 0.442, p = 0.009) and with phobias in SCL-90 scale in patients' group (r = 0.531, p = 0.001). There was decreased concentration of TNF-α (t = 4.256, p < 0.001) in depressed patients compared to controls. IgG concentration of 38.63% food products positively correlated with TNF-α concentration in depressed patients compared to 9.09% of those in healthy controls.We observed an immune suppression of IgG response to dairy proteins in depressed patients. Hypercortisolemia with involvement of decreased concentration of TNF-α might play a significant role in suppression of IgG response in depressed patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27730676>New biomarkers for increased intestinal permeability induced by dextran sodium sulphate and fasting in chickens.</a></h1><p>Increased intestinal permeability (IP) can lead to compromised health in chickens. As there is limited literature on in vivo biomarkers to assess increased IP in chickens, the objective of this study was to identify a reliable biomarker of IP using DSS ingestion and fasting models. Male Ross chickens (n = 48) were reared until day 14 on the floor pen in an animal care facility, randomized into the following groups: control, DSS and fasting (each with n = 16), and then placed in metabolism cages. DSS was administered in drinking water at 0.75% from days 16 to 21, while controls and fasted groups received water. All birds had free access to feed and water except the birds in the fasting group that were denied feed for 19.5 h on day 20. On day 21, all chickens were given two separate oral gavages comprising fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d, . mg in 1 ml/bird) at time zero and lactulose, mannitol and rhamnose (LMR) sugars (0.25 g L, 0.05 g M and 0.05 g R in  ml/bird) at 60 min. Whole blood was collected from the brachial vein in a syringe 90 min post-LMR sugar gavage. Serum FITC-d and plasma LMR sugar concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry and high-performance ion chromatography respectively. Plasma concentrations of intestinal fatty acid binding protein, diamine oxidase, tight junction protein (TJP), d-lactate and faecal α-antitrypsin inhibitor concentration were also analysed by ELISA. FITC-d increased significantly (p < 0.05) after fasting compared with control. L/M and L/R ratios for fasting and L/M ratio for DSS increased compared with control chickens (p < 0.05). TJP in plasma was significantly increased due to fasting but not DSS treatment, compared with controls. Other tests did not indicate changes in IP (p > 0.05). We concluded that FITC-d and LMR sugar tests can be used in chickens to assess changes in IP.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28208612>Enteric Pathogens and Their Toxin-Induced Disruption of the Intestinal Barrier through Alteration of Tight Junctions in Chickens.</a></h1><p>Maintaining a healthy  environment is a prerequisite for sustainable animal production. The  plays a key role in the digestion and absorption of nutrients and constitutes an initial organ exposed to external factors influencing bird's health. The intestinal epithelial barrier serves as the first line of defense between the host and the luminal environment. It consists of a continuous monolayer of intestinal epithelial cells connected by intercellular junctional complexes which shrink the space between adjacent cells. Consequently, free passing of solutes and water via the paracellular pathway is prevented. Tight junctions (TJs) are multi-protein complexes which are crucial for the integrity and function of the epithelial barrier as they not only link cells but also form channels allowing permeation between cells, resulting in epithelial surfaces of different tightness. Tight junction's molecular composition, ultrastructure, and function are regulated differently with regard to physiological and pathological stimuli. Both in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that reduced tight junction integrity greatly results in a condition commonly known as " ". A loss of barrier integrity allows the translocation of luminal antigens (microbes, toxins) via the mucosa to access the whole body which are normally excluded and subsequently destroys the  mucosal homeostasis, coinciding with an increased susceptibility to systemic infection, chronic inflammation and malabsorption. There is considerable evidence that the intestinal barrier dysfunction is an important factor contributing to the pathogenicity of some enteric bacteria. It has been shown that some enteric pathogens can induce permeability defects in  epithelia by altering tight junction proteins, mediated by their toxins. Resolving the strategies that microorganisms use to hijack the functions of tight junctions is important for our understanding of microbial pathogenesis, because some pathogens can utilize tight junction proteins as receptors for attachment and subsequent internalization, while others modify or destroy the tight junction proteins by different pathways and thereby provide a gateway to the underlying tissue. This review aims to deliver an overview of the tight junction structures and function, and its role in enteric bacterial pathogenesis with a special focus on chickens. A main conclusion will be that the molecular mechanisms used by enteric pathogens to disrupt epithelial barrier function in chickens needs a much better understanding, explicitly highlighted for  and . This is a requirement in order to assist in discovering new strategies to avoid damages of the intestinal barrier or to minimize consequences from infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411319>TMA but not TMAO increases with age in rat plasma and affects smooth muscle cells viability.</a></h1><p>It has been suggested that trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), a liver oxygenation product of  bacteria-produced trimethylamine (TMA), is a marker of cardiovascular risk. However, mechanisms of the increase and biological effects of TMAO are obscure. Furthermore, the potential role of TMAO precursor, i.e. TMA has not been investigated. We evaluated the effect of age, a cardiovascular risk factor, on plasma levels of TMA and TMAO,  bacteria composition, -to-blood penetration of TMA, histological and hemodynamic parameters in 3-month-old and 18-month-old, male, Sprague-Dawley and Wistar-Kyoto rats. Cytotoxicity of TMA and TMAO was studied in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs). Older rats showed significantly different  bacteria composition, a significantly higher guttoblood TMA penetration, and morphological and hemodynamic alterations in intestines. In vitro, TMA at concentration of 500 µmol/L (-fold higher than in portal blood) decreased hVSMCs viability. In contrast, TMAO at 1000-fold higher concentration than physiological one, had no effect on hVSMCs viability. In conclusion, older rats show higher plasma level of TMA due to a " ". TMA but not TMAO affects hVSMCs viability. We propose that TMA but not TMAO may be a marker and mediator of cardiovascular risk.© The Author(s) 2019.

PTLDS represents a small subset of patients treated for an erythema migrans (EM) rash with persistent or recurrent symptoms and functional decline. The larger population with chronic Lyme disease is less understood and well defined. Multiple Systemic Infectious Disease Syndrome (MSIDS) is a multifactorial model for treating chronic disease(s), which identifies up to 16 overlapping sources of inflammation and their downstream effects. A patient symptom survey and a retrospective chart review of 200 patients was therefore performed on those patients with chronic Lyme disease/PTLDS to identify those variables on the MSIDS model with the greatest potential effect on regaining health. Results indicate that dapsone combination therapy decreased the severity of eight major Lyme symptoms, and multiple sources of inflammation (other infections, immune dysfunction, autoimmunity, food allergies/sensitivities,  , mineral deficiencies, environmental toxins with detoxification problems, and sleep disorders) along with downstream effects of inflammation may all affect chronic symptomatology. In part two of our observational study and review paper, we postulate that the use of this model can represent an important and needed paradigm shift in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29056165>The   and Altered Microbiome in Chronic Kidney Disease.</a></h1><p>Chronic kidney disease results in disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier as well as profound changes in the  microbial flora. These events are largely mediated by (1) heavy influx of circulating urea to the  lumen and () dietary restrictions of foods containing high fiber (such as fruits and vegetable) and symbiotic organisms (such as yogurt and cheese) imposed to mitigate hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. Collectively, these factors promote systemic inflammation and cardiovascular morbidity by mediating microbial dysbiosis, disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier, and translocation of endotoxin, bacterial fragments, and uremic toxins across the " " into the bloodstream. Strategies aimed at increasing dietary fiber and lowering urea burden may help to attenuate uremia-induced microbial dysbiosis and epithelial barrier breakdown, and thereby improve systemic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

The gastrointestinal tract is seldom discussed as an organ system of principal importance for metabolic diseases. The present overview connects various metabolic research lines into an integrative physiological context in which the gastrointestinal tract is included. Strong evidence for the involvement of the  in the metabolic syndrome derives from the powerful effects of weight-reducing (bariatric) gastrointestinal surgery. In fact, gastrointestinal surgery is now recommended as a standard treatment option for type  diabetes in obesity. Several -related mechanisms that potentially contribute to the metabolic syndrome will be presented. Obesity can be caused by hampered release of satiety-signalling  hormones, reduced meal-associated energy expenditure and microbiota-assisted harvest of energy from nondigestible food ingredients. Adiposity per se is a well-established risk factor for hyperglycaemia. In addition, a   mucosa can trigger systemic inflammation mediating peripheral insulin resistance that together with a blunted incretin response aggravates the hyperglycaemic state. The intestinal microbiota is strongly associated with obesity and the related metabolic disease states, although the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Enterorenal signalling has been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension and postprandial triglyceride-rich chylomicrons; in addition, intestinal cholesterol metabolism probably contributes to atherosclerosis. It is likely that in the future, the metabolic syndrome will be treated according to novel pharmacological principles interfering with gastrointestinal functionality.© 2016 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546668>TREM Receptors Connecting Bowel Inflammation to Neurodegenerative Disorders.</a></h1><p>Alterations in Triggering Receptors Expressed on Myeloid cells (TREM-1/) are bound to a variety of infectious, sterile inflammatory, and degenerative conditions, ranging from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to neurodegenerative disorders. TREMs are emerging as key players in pivotal mechanisms often concurring in IBD and neurodegeneration, namely microbiota dysbiosis,  , and inflammation. In conditions of dysbiosis, compounds released by intestinal bacteria activate TREMs on macrophages, leading to an exuberant pro-inflammatory reaction up to damage in the  barrier. In turn, TREM-positive activated macrophages along with inflammatory mediators may reach the brain through the blood, glymphatic system, circumventricular organs, or the vagus nerve via the microbiota--brain axis. This leads to a systemic inflammatory response which, in turn, impairs the blood-brain barrier, while promoting further TREM-dependent neuroinflammation and, ultimately, neural injury. Nonetheless, controversial results still exist on the role of TREM- compared with TREM-1, depending on disease specificity, stage, and degree of inflammation. Therefore, the present review aimed to provide an update on the role of TREMs in the pathophysiology of IBD and neurodegeneration. The evidence here discussed the highlights of the potential role of TREMs, especially TREM-1, in bridging inflammatory processes in intestinal and neurodegenerative disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311609>Pregnancy and lactation interfere with the response of autoimmunity to modulation of  microbiota.</a></h1><p>Dysbiosis of  microbiota exists in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus). Lupus patients who experienced pregnancy usually had more severe disease flares post-delivery. However, the possible role of  microbiota in the link between pregnancy and exacerbation of lupus remains to be explored.In the classical lupus mouse model MRL/lpr, we compared the structures of  microbiota in pregnant and lactating individuals vs. age-matched naïve mice. Consistent with studies on non-lupus mice, both pregnancy and lactation significantly changed the composition and diversity of  microbiota. Strikingly, modulation of  microbiota using the same strategy resulted in different disease outcomes in postpartum (abbreviated as "PP," meaning that the mice had undergone pregnancy and lactation) vs. control (naïve; i.e., without pregnancy or lactation) MRL/lpr females; while vancomycin treatment attenuated lupus in naïve mice, it did not do so, or even exacerbated lupus, in PP mice. Lactobacillus animalis flourished in the  upon vancomycin treatment, and direct administration of L. animalis via oral gavage recapitulated the differential effects of vancomycin in PP vs. control mice. An enzyme called indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase was significantly inhibited by L. animalis; however, this inhibition was only apparent in PP mice, which explained, at least partially, the lack of beneficial response to vancomycin in these mice. The differential production of immunosuppressive IL-10 and proinflammatory IFNγ in PP vs. control mice further explained why the disease phenotypes varied between the two types of mice bearing the same  microbiota remodeling strategy.These results suggest that pregnancy and lactation interfere with the response of autoimmunity to modulation of  microbiota. Further studies are necessary to better understand the complex relationship between pregnancy and lupus.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29034530>Gene expression and morphological changes in the intestinal mucosa associated with increased permeability induced by short-term fasting in chickens.</a></h1><p>Short-term fasting for 4.5 and 9 hr has been demonstrated to increase intestinal permeability (IP) in chickens. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 0, 4.5, 9 and 19.5 hr fasting on intestinal gene expression and villus-crypt architecture of enterocytes in jejunal and ileal samples. On day 38, Ross-308 male birds were fasted according to their group and then euthanised. Two separate intestinal sections (each  cm long, jejunum and ileum) were collected. One section was utilised for villus height and crypt depth measurements. The second section was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of tight junction proteins (TJP) including claudin-1, claudin-3, occludin, zonula occludens (ZO-1, ZO-), junctional adhesion molecules (JAM) and E-cadherin. Additionally genes involved in enterocyte protection including glucagon-like peptide (GLP-), heat-shock protein (HSP-70), intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), toll-like receptors (TLR-4), mucin (MUC-), cluster differentiation (CD-36) and fatty acid-binding protein (FABP-6) were also analysed. Normally distributed data were analysed using one-way analysis of variance ANOVA. Other data were analysed by non-parametric one-way ANOVA. Villus height and crypt depth were increased (p < .05) only in the ileum after fasting for 4.5 and 9 hr compared with non-fasting group. mRNA expression of claudin-3 was significantly reduced in the ileum of birds fasted for 9 and 19.5 hr, suggesting a role in IP modulation. However, all other TJP genes examined were not statistically different from control. Nevertheless, ileal FABP-6 of all fasted groups was significantly reduced, which could possibly be due to reduced bile acid production during fasting.© 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29306937>The Effects of Stress and Meditation on the Immune System, Human Microbiota, and Epigenetics.</a></h1><p>Context • Globally, more than 25% of individuals are affected by anxiety and depression disorders. Meditation is gaining popularity in clinical settings and its treatment efficacy is being studied for a wide array of psychological and physiological ailments. An exploration of stress physiology is an essential precursor to delineation of the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of meditation practices. Objective • The review outlines a model of interconnected physiological processes that might support the continued inclusion and expansion of meditation in the treatment of diverse medical conditions and to investigate the role that  microbiota may play in realizing well-being through meditation. Design • The authors conducted a scientific literature database search with the goal of reviewing the link between stress management techniques and human microbiota. Their goal was also to identify the extent of underlying epigenetic reactions in these processes. The review was completed in approximately  y. Databases searched included Medline via PubMed and Ovid, PsycINFO via Ovid, Spinet, ProQuest Central, SAGE Research Methods Online, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Science Direct, Springer Link, and Wiley Online Library. Keywords searched included, but were not limited to, stress, meditation, mindfulness, immune system, HPA axis, sympathetic nervous system, parasympathetic nervous system, microbiota, microbiome, -barrier function,  , vagus nerve, psychoneuroimmunology, epigenetic, and NF-κB. Setting • The study took place at New York University (New York, NY, USA), the University of California, San Diego (La Jolla, CA, USA), and the Chopra Foundation (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Results • Psychological stress typically triggers a fight-or-flight response, prompting corticotropin-releasing hormone and catecholamine production in various parts of the body, which ultimately disturbs the microbiota. In the absence of stress, a healthy microbiota produces short-chain fatty acids that exert anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects. During stress, an altered  microbial population affects the regulation of neurotransmitters mediated by the microbiome and  barrier function. Meditation helps regulate the stress response, thereby suppressing chronic inflammation states and maintaining a healthy -barrier function. Conclusions • The current research team recommends the integration of meditation into conventional health care and wellness models. Concurrently, studies to explore the effects of meditation on human microbiota are warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31327219>Parkinson's Disease: The Emerging Role of  Dysbiosis, Antibiotics, Probiotics, and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation.</a></h1><p>The role of the microbiome in health and human disease has emerged at the forefront of medicine in the 21st century. Over the last  decades evidence has emerged to suggest that inflammation-derived oxidative damage and cytokine induced toxicity may play a significant role in the neuronal damage associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and T cell infiltration has been observed in the brain parenchyma of patients with PD. Furthermore, evidence for inflammatory changes has been reported in the enteric nervous system, the vagus nerve branches and glial cells. The presence of α-synuclein deposits in the post-mortem brain biopsy in patients with PD has further substantiated the role of inflammation in PD. It has been suggested that the α-synuclein misfolding might begin in the  and spread "prion like" via the vagus nerve into lower brainstem and ultimately to the midbrain; this is known as the Braak hypothesis. It is noteworthy that the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms (constipation, dysphagia, and hypersalivation), altered  microbiota and   have been observed in PD patients several years prior to the clinical onset of the disease. These clinical observations have been supported by in vitro studies in mice as well, demonstrating the role of genetic (α-synuclein overexpression) and environmental ( dysbiosis) factors in the pathogenesis of PD. The restoration of the  microbiome in patients with PD may alter the clinical progression of PD and this alteration can be accomplished by carefully designed studies using customized probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30655633>Multidisciplinary approach to prostatitis.</a></h1><p>The modern clinical research on prostatitis started with the work of Stamey and coworkers who developed the basic principles we are still using. They established the segmented culture technique for localizing the infections in the males to the urethra, the bladder, or the prostate and to differentiate the main categories of prostatitis. Such categories with slight modifications are still used according to the NIH classification: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) and asymptomatic prostatitis. Prostatic inflammation is considered an important factor in influencing both prostatic growth and progression of symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Chronic inflammation/neuroinflammation is a result of a deregulated acute phase response of the innate immune system affecting surrounding neural tissue at molecular, structural and functional levels. Clinical observations suggest that chronic inflammation correlates with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and an history of clinical chronic prostatitis significantly increases the odds for prostate cancer. The NIHNIDDK classification based on the use of the microbiological 4- glasses localization test or simplified -glasses test, is currently accepted worldwide. The UPOINT system identifies groups of clinicians with homogeneous clinical presentation and is used to recognize phenotypes to be submitted to specific treatments. The UPOINTS algorithm implemented the original UPOINT adding to the urinary domains (U), psycho-social (P), organspecific (O), infection (I), neurological (N), muscle tension and tenderness (T) a further domain related to sexuality (S). In fact sexual dysfunction (erectile, ejaculatory, libido loss) has been described in 46-92% of cases with a high impact on the quality of life of patients with CP/CPPS. Prostatic ultrasound represents the most popular imaging test in the work-up of either acute and chronic prostatitis although no specific hypo-hyperechoic pattern has been clearly associated with chronic bacterial prostatitis and CPPS. Use of a digital-processing software to calculate the extension of prostatic calcification area at ultrasound demonstrated a higher percentage of prostatic calcification in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis. Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) is the current state-of-the art imaging modality in the assessment of patients with prostate cancer although a variety of benign conditions, including inflammation, may mimic prostate cancer and act as confounding factors in the discrimination between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Bacteria can infect prostate gland by: ascending the urethra, reflux of urine into the prostatic ducts, direct inoculation of bacteria through inserted biopsy needles or hematogenous seeding. Enterobacteriaceae are the predominant pathogens in acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, but an increasing role of Enterococci has been reported. Many strains of these uropathogens exhibit the ability to form biofilm and multidrug- resistance. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) agents, in particular Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium, have been also considered as causative pathogens of chronic bacterial prostatitis. On the contrary the effective role in genital diseases of other "genital mycoplasmas" is still a much debated issue. Sexually Transmitted Infections agents should be investigated by molecular methods in both patient and sexual partner. "Next generation" investigations, such as cytokine analysis, cytological typing of immune cells could help stratifying the immune response. Epigenetic dysregulation of inflammatory factors should be investigated according to systemic and compartment-specific signals. The search for biomarkers should also include evaluation of hormonal pathways, as measurement of estrogen levels in semen. Antimicrobials are the first line agents for the treatment of bacterial prostatitis. The success of antimicrobial treatment depends on the antibacterial activity and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug which must reach high concentrations in prostate secretion and prostate tissue. Acute bacterial prostatitis can be a serious infection with a potential risk for urosepsis For iInitial treatment of severely ill patients, intravenous administration of high doses of bactericidal antimicrobials, such as broad-spectrum penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, is recommended in combination with an aminoglycoside. Use of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem is justified in presence of multiresistant gramnegative pathogens. The antibiotic treatment of chronic prostatitis is currently based on the use of fluoroquinolones that, given for  to 4 weeks, cured about 70% of men with chronic bacterial prostatitis. For the treatment of Chlamydial prostatitis macrolides were shown to be more effective than fluoroquinolones, whereas no differences were observed in microbiological and clinical efficacy between macrolides and tetracyclines for the treatment of infections caused by intracellular pathogens. Aminoglycosides and fosfomycin could be considered as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of quinolone resistant prostatitis. Use of alpha-blockers in CP/CPPS patients with urinary symptoms and analgesics +/- non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), in presence of pain demonstrated a reduction of symptoms reduction and an improvement of quality of life, although long term use of NSAID is limited by side effect profile. However, the multimodal therapeutic regimen by contemporary use of alphablockers, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory showed a better control of prostatitis symptoms than single drug treatment. Novel therapeutic substances for the treatment of pain, such as the cannabinoid anandamide would be highly interesting to test. An alternative for the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is phytotherapy, as primary therapy or in association with other drugs. Quercetin, pollen extract, extract of Serenoa repens and other mixtures of herbal extracts showed a positive effect on symptoms and quality of life without side effects. The association of CP/CPPS with alterations of intestinal function has been described. Diet has its effects on inflammation by regulation of the composition of intestinal flora and direct action on the intestinal cells (sterile inflammation). Intestinal bacteria (microbiota) interacts with food influencing the metabolic, immune and inflammatory response of the organism. The intestinal microbiota has protective function against pathogenic bacteria, metabolic function by synthesis of vitamins, decomposition of bile acids and production of trophic factors (butyrate), and modulation of the intestinal immune system. The alteration of the microbiota is called "dysbiosis" causing invasive intestinal diseases pathologies (  syndrome and food intolerances, irritable bowel syndrome or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases) and correlating with numerous systemic diseases including acute and chronic prostatitis. Administration of live probiotics bacteria can be used to regulate the balance if intestinal flora. Sessions of hydrocolontherapy can represent an integration to this therapeutic approach. Finally, microbiological examination of sexual partners can offer supplementary information for treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27349436>The Role of the Microbial Metabolites Including Tryptophan Catabolites and Short Chain Fatty Acids in the Pathophysiology of Immune-Inflammatory and Neuroimmune Disease.</a></h1><p>There is a growing awareness that  commensal metabolites play a major role in host physiology and indeed the pathophysiology of several illnesses. The composition of the microbiota largely determines the levels of tryptophan in the systemic circulation and hence, indirectly, the levels of serotonin in the brain. Some microbiota synthesize neurotransmitters directly, e.g., gamma-amino butyric acid, while modulating the synthesis of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). The composition of the microbiota determines the levels and nature of tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) which in turn has profound effects on aryl hydrocarbon receptors, thereby influencing epithelial barrier integrity and the presence of an inflammatory or tolerogenic environment in the intestine and beyond. The composition of the microbiota also determines the levels and ratios of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate and propionate. Butyrate is a key energy source for colonocytes. Dysbiosis leading to reduced levels of SCFAs, notably butyrate, therefore may have adverse effects on epithelial barrier integrity, energy homeostasis, and the T helper 17/regulatory/T cell balance. Moreover, dysbiosis leading to reduced butyrate levels may increase bacterial translocation into the systemic circulation.

Claudin-, one of the 27 mammalian claudins regulating that barrier function, forms a paracellular channel for small cations and water. It is typically expressed in  epithelia like proximal nephron and small intestine and provides a major pathway for the paracellular transport of sodium, potassium, and fluid. In intestinal inflammation (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), immune-mediated diseases (celiac disease), and infections (HIV enteropathy), claudin- is upregulated in small and large intestine and contributes to diarrhea via a leak flux mechanism. In parallel to that upregulation, other epithelial and tight junctional features are altered and the luminal uptake of antigenic macromolecules is enhanced, for which claudin- may be partially responsible through induction of tight junction strand discontinuities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30109601>Common Genetic Variants Link the Abnormalities in the -Brain Axis in Prematurity and Autism.</a></h1><p>This review considers a link between prematurity and autism by comparing symptoms, physiological abnormalities, and behavior. It focuses on the bidirectional signaling between the microbiota and the brain, here defined as the microbiota--vagus-heart-brain (MGVHB) axis and its systemic disruption accompanying altered neurodevelopment. Data derived from clinical and animal studies document increased prevalence of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms in both premature and autistic children and suggest an incomplete maturation of the -blood barrier resulting in a " ," dysbiosis, abnormalities in vagal regulation of the heart, altered development of specific brain regions, and behavior. Furthermore, this review posits the hypothesis that common genetic variants link the abnormalities in the MGVHB axis in premature and autistic pathologies. This hypothesis is based on the recently identified common genetic variants: early B cell factor 1 (EBF1), selenocysteine tRNA-specific eukaryotic elongation factor (EEFSEC), and angiotensin II receptor type  (AGTR2), in the maternal and infant DNA samples, associated with risk of preterm birth and independently implicated in a risk of autism. We predict that the AGTR2 variants involved in the brain maturation and oxytocin-arginine-vasopressin (OXT-AVP) pathways, related to social behavior, will contribute to our understanding of the link between prematurity and autism paving a way to new therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29708627>Effect of humic acids on intestinal viscosity,   and ammonia excretion in a 24 hr feed restriction model to induce intestinal permeability in broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of humic acids (HA) on intestinal viscosity,   and ammonia excretion in a 24 hr feed restriction (FR) model to induce intestinal permeability in chickens. One-day-old male Cobb-Vantress broilers were randomly allocated to one of two groups (n = 25 chickens), with or without 0.% of isolated HA from worm-compost, and placed in brooder batteries. Chicks had ad libitum access to water and feed for 14 days. Intestinal permeability was induced by 24 hr FR starting at 14 days. At 15 days of age, chickens in both groups were given an appropriate dose of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) by oral gavage. Intestine and liver samples were also collected to evaluate viscosity and bacterial translocation (BT), respectively. An increase (p < .05) in intestinal viscosity was observed in the experimental group consuming 0.% of HA and was confirmed in a published in vitro digestion model that simulates the chemical and physical conditions of the crop, proventriculus and intestine of chickens. Furthermore, the treated group also showed a significant reduction in FITC-d, liver BT and ammonia in the manure.

Experiments were conducted in broiler chickens to evaluate supplementation of L-glutamine, glycine, and L-arginine in a reduced protein (RP) diet. Experiment 1 examined the growth performance of broilers fed 5 dietary treatments: 1) a standard diet; ) an RP diet (193.9 g/kg CP in grower and 176.9 g/kg CP in finisher); 3) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg L-Gln; 4) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg Gly; 5) RP diet supplemented with 5 g/kg L-Arg. Each experimental diet was replicated 6 times with 10 birds per replicate. In a subset of 96 birds, experiment  tested the 4 RP diets with and without dexamethasone (DEX) to induce  . Each diet was replicated 24 times. Fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) was used to test intestinal permeability (IP). Gene expression of selected tight junction proteins in ileal and jejunal tissues was assayed by quantitative PCR. From day 7 to 35, the RP diet increased feed intake (FI) (P < 0.05) and body weight gain (BWG) compared with the standard diet while Gln reduced FI and BWG (P < 0.05) compared with RP. Gly had no effect on BWG or FCR. Supplementation of Arg improved FCR from day 21 to 35 and day 7 to 35. In experiment , Arg tended to lower FITC-d (P = 0.086). DEX increased passage of FITC-d into the serum (P < 0.001). The villi surface area was increased in birds fed higher Arg (P < 0.05). DEX and diet interacted (P < 0.01) for jejunal claudin-3 mRNA level where DEX upregulated claudin-3 for all diets except the Arg diet. In summary, with a moderate reduction of protein, satisfactory performance can be obtained. Although Gln and Gly had no demonstrable positive effect on IP and performance of broilers, increasing the dietary Arg by approximately 140% improved FCR and showed indications of improved intestinal barrier function of birds fed an RP diet under a stress model.© The Author(s) 2019.

Little is known about the impact of early life stress on the offspring before adulthood and the influence of sex. We investigated whether male and female rats previously exposed to LNS displays at weaning altered corticosterone, intestinal permeability, and microbiota.Wistar rat dams and litters were maintained from PND2 to 10 with limited nesting/bedding materials and thereafter reverted to normal housing up to weaning (PND21). Control litters had normal housing. At weaning, we monitored body weight, corticosterone plasma levels (enzyme immunoassay), in vivo intestinal to colon permeability (fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4 kDa) and fecal microbiota (DNA extraction and amplification of the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene).At weaning, LNS pups had hypercorticosteronemia and enhanced intestinal permeability with females > males while body weights were similar. LNS decreased fecal microbial diversity and induced a distinct composition characterized by increased abundance of Gram positive cocci and reduction of fiber-degrading, butyrate-producing, and mucus-resident microbes.These data indicate that chronic exposure to LNS during the first week post-natally has sustained effects monitored at weaning including hypercorticosteronemia, a  , and dysbiosis.

In recent years, the gastrointestinal tract has emerged as a major instigator of systemic inflammation in CKD. Postmortem studies previously discovered  wall inflammation throughout the digestive tract in chronic dialysis patients. In CKD animals, colon wall inflammation is associated with breakdown of the epithelial tight junction barrier (' ') and translocation of bacterial DNA and endotoxin into the bloodstream.  bacterial DNA and endotoxin have also been detected in the serum from CKD and dialysis patients, whereby endotoxin levels increase with the CKD stage and correlate with the severity of systemic inflammation in the dialysis population. The CKD diet that is low in plant fiber and symbiotic organisms (in adherence with low potassium, low phosphorus intake) can alter the normal  microbiome, leading to overgrowth of bacteria that produce uremic toxins such as cresyl and indoxyl molecules. The translocation of these toxins from the ' ' into the bloodstream further promotes systemic inflammation, adverse cardiovascular outcomes and CKD progression. Data are lacking on optimal fiber and yogurt consumption in CKD that would favor growth of a more symbiotic microbiome while avoiding potassium and phosphorus overload. Prebiotic and probiotic formulations have shown promise in small clinical trials, in terms of lowering serum levels of uremic toxins and improving quality of life. The evidence points to a strong relationship between intestinal inflammation and adverse outcomes in CKD, and more trials investigating -targeted therapeutics are needed.© 2015 S.

So far the traditionally prescribed prebiotics and probiotics do not show significant impact on amelioration of these diseases in general. Thus the development of next generation prebiotics and probiotics designed to target specific diseases is urgently needed. In this review, we first make a brief introduction on current understandings of normal  microbiota, microbiome, and their roles in homeostasis of mucosal immunity and  integrity. Then, under the situation of microbiota dysbiosis, development of chronic inflammations in the intestine occurs, leading to   situation and systematic chronic inflammation in the host. These subsequently resulted in development of many important diseases such as obesity, type  diabetes mellitus, liver inflammations, and other diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC), obesity-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD), the compromised lung immunity, and some on brain/neuro disorders. The strategy used to optimally implant the effective prebiotics, probiotics and the derived postbiotics for amelioration of the diseases is presented. While the effectiveness of these agents seems promising, additional studies are needed to establish recommendations for most clinical settings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27741171> Microbiota and the Liver: A Tale of  Cities: A Narrative View in  Acts.</a></h1><p>Microbes are mostly important for the digestion of food, the absorption of some micronutrients, and the production of vitamins. The microbiota stimulates lymphoid structures in the gastrointestinal mucosa and decrease pathogens by competing for nutrients and space. Bacterial translocation is defined as the escape of  bacteria and their products through the intestinal mucosa to the outside of the intestine as portovenous or systemic circulation. This is induced by a   barrier. There is evidence for a role of intestinal permeability in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In the liver, bacterial products can bind to their specific pathogen recognition receptors on parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells, producing an inflammatory response and enhancing disease progression. When binding, bacterial products bind to their receptors, initiating intracellular signalling and inducing an inflammatory cascade, thus accelerating liver cell damage and fibrosis. However, the liver can also increase  permeability, producing proinflammatory cytokines, and reversing them into the blood stream. Modification of the  microbiota could lead to benefit in patients with liver disease. Nonabsorbable antibiotics (rifaximin) prevent and relieve overt encephalopathy. Probiotics alone are not capable of turning back overt encephalopathy, but could prevent its development. There is some evidence that probiotics could relent the progression of nonalcoholic liver disease, and possibly reverse steatosis. Antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones, reduce the risk of development of the first episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and mortality in cirrhotic patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972627>Upregulation of the Intestinal Paracellular Pathway with Breakdown of Tight and Adherens Junctions in Deficit Schizophrenia.</a></h1><p>In 2001, the first author of this paper reported that schizophrenia is associated with an increased frequency of the haptoglobin (Hp)- gene. The precursor of Hp- is zonulin, a molecule that affects intercellular tight junction integrity. Recently, we reported increased plasma IgA/IgM responses to Gram-negative bacteria in deficit schizophrenia indicating   and  dysbiosis. The current study was performed to examine the integrity of the paracellular (tight and adherens junctions) and transcellular (cytoskeletal proteins) pathways in deficit versus non-deficit schizophrenia. We measured IgM responses to zonulin, occludin, E-cadherin, talin, actin, and vinculin in association with IgA responses to Gram-negative bacteria, CCL-11, IgA responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), immune activation and IgM to malondialdehyde (MDA), and NO-cysteinyl in 78 schizophrenia patients and 40 controls. We found that the ratio of IgM to zonulin + occludin/talin + actin + viculin (PARA/TRANS) was significantly greater in deficit than those in non-deficit schizophrenia and higher in schizophrenia than those in controls and was significantly associated with increased IgA responses to Gram-negative bacteria. IgM responses to zonulin were positively associated with schizophrenia (versus controls), while IgM to occludin was significantly associated with deficit schizophrenia (versus non-deficit schizophrenia and controls). A large part of the variance (90.8%) in negative and PHEM (psychosis, hostility, excitation, and mannerism) symptoms was explained by PARA/TRANS ratio, IgA to Gram-negative bacteria, IgM to E-cadherin and MDA, and memory dysfunctions, while 53.3% of the variance in the latter was explained by PARA/TRANS ratio, IgA to Gram-negative bacteria, CCL-11, TRYCATs, and immune activation. The results show an upregulated paracellular pathway with breakdown of the tight and adherens junctions and increased bacterial translocation in deficit schizophrenia. These dysfunctions in the intestinal paracellular route together with lowered natural IgM, immune activation, and production of CCL-11 and TRYCATs contribute to the phenomenology of deficit schizophrenia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30925795>The Transformative Possibilities of the Microbiota and Mycobiota for Health, Disease, Aging, and Technological Innovation.</a></h1><p>The  microbiota is extremely important for the health of the host across its lifespan.Recent studies have elucidated connections between the  microbiota and neurological diseaseand disorders such as depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism, and a host of otherbrain illnesses.

Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli are isolated most frequently from human stool samples, but severe infections by C. fetus (Cf), which can cause gastroenteritis, septicemia, and abortion, are also found. This study aims at the characterization of pathological changes in Cf infection using an intestinal epithelial cell model. The Cf-induced epithelial barrier defects appeared earlier than those of avian Campylobacter species like C. jejuni/C. coli. Two-path impedance spectroscopy (2PI) distinguished transcellular and paracellular resistance contributions to the overall epithelial barrier impairment. Both transcellular and paracellular resistance of Cf-infected HT-29/B6 monolayers were reduced. The latter was attributed to activation of active anion secretion. Western blot analysis showed no decrease in tight junction (TJ) protein expression (claudin-1, -, -3, and -4) but showed redistribution of claudin-1 off the TJ domain. In addition, Cf induced epithelial cell death, cell detachment, and lesions (focal leaks), as the result of which macromolecule flux (10-kDa dextran) was increased in Cf-invaded cell monolayers. In conclusion, barrier dysfunction from Cf infection was due to TJ protein redistribution, cell death induction, and leak formation, resulting in bacterial translocation, ion leak flux, and antigen uptake ( ).© 2017 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27904960>Active and passive involvement of claudins in the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammatory diseases.</a></h1><p>Intestinal inflammatory diseases, four of which are discussed here, are associated with alterations of claudins. In ulcerative colitis, diarrhea and antigen entry into the mucosa occurs. Claudin- is upregulated but data on other claudins are still limited or vary (e.g., claudin-1 and -4). Apart from that, tight junction changes contribute to diarrhea via a leak flux mechanism, while protection against antigen entry disappears behind epithelial gross lesions (erosions) and apoptotic foci. Crohn's disease is additionally characterized by a claudin-5 and claudin-8 reduction which plays an active role in antigen uptake already before gross lesions appear. In microscopic colitis (MC), upregulation of claudin- expression is weak and a reduction in claudin-4 may be only passively involved, while sodium malabsorption represents the main diarrheal mechanism. However, claudin-5 is removed from MC tight junctions which may be an active trigger for inflammation through antigen uptake along the so-called   concept. In celiac disease, primary barrier defects are discussed in the context of candidate genes as PARD3 which regulate cell polarity and tight junctions. The loss of claudin-5 allows small antigens to invade, while the reductions in others like claudin-3 are rather passive events. Taken together, the specific role of single tight junction proteins for the onset and perpetuation of inflammation and the recovery from these diseases is far from being fully understood and is clearly dependent on the stage of the disease, the background of the other tight junction components, the transport activity of the mucosa, and the presence of other barrier features like gross lesions, an orchestral interplay which is discussed in this article.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30476152>The effect of recovery from heat stress on circulating bioenergetics and inflammatory biomarkers.</a></h1><p>Heat stress (HS) jeopardizes animal productivity and health. The intestinal barrier is sensitive to HS and heat-induced hyperpermeability plays a key role in its pathophysiology. However, the biology of recovery following HS is less understood. Thus, study objectives were to determine the temporal pattern of metabolic, inflammatory, and intestinal histological parameters during HS recovery. Female pigs (n = 32; 19.5 ± 0.5 kg BW) were sacrificed following exposure to 1 of 4 environmental treatments: 1) constant thermoneutral (TN) conditions (TNC; 24. ± 0.5°C), ) no TN recovery post HS (0D), 3) 3 d of TN recovery post HS (3D), and 4) 7 d of TN recovery post HS (7D). The HS protocol was cyclical (33.6 ± 1.8 to 37.4 ± .1°C) and lasted for 3 d for all HS treatments. During the 3 d of HS, rectal temperature, skin temperature, and respiration rates were increased (1.3°C, 4.8°C, and 77 breaths/min, respectively; P < 0.01) and ADFI was decreased (27%; P < 0.01) compared to TNC pigs. Skin temperature tended to be decreased 0.6°C in 3D pigs during days 1-3 of recovery (P = 0.06) and was decreased 1.6 and 0.7°C during days 1-3 and 4-7 of recovery, respectively, in 7D pigs (P ≤ 0.03) compared to TNC. Relative to TNC pigs, ADFI remained 14% decreased during days 1-3 of recovery in both 3D and 7D pigs, and 17% decreased during days 4-7 in 7D pigs (P ≤ 0.01). Plasma glucose was decreased (10%; P = 0.03) for 0D and 3D relative to TNC pigs. Circulating lipopolysaccharide-binding protein was increased in 3D and 7D vs. TNC pigs (110 and 147%, respectively; P = 0.01) and tended to increase linearly with increasing recovery time (P = 0.08). Circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha was decreased (15%) in 0D pigs and increased linearly with advancing recovery time (P < 0.01). Jejunum and ileum villus height were reduced 17 and 11% in 0D vs. TNC pigs and increased linearly with progressive recovery time (P < 0.01). Jejunum and ileum mucosal surface areas were reduced 17 and 9% in 0D pigs and remained decreased in the jejunum while the ileum recovered to TNC levels by day 3 of recovery. Relative to TNC pigs, goblet cell area was similar in jejunum and colon of 0D pigs but was reduced in the ileum of 0D pigs and in jejunum, ileum, and colon of 3D and 7D relative to TNC pigs (P < 0.01). In summary, HS has deleterious effects on intestinal morphology that seem to improve with recovery time.

The mechanisms by which L. reuteri confers its health-promoting effects are far from being fully understood, but protection of the mucosal barrier is thought to be important.   is a state of abnormal intestinal permeability with implications for the pathophysiology of various gastrointestinal disorders. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) can invade the intestinal mucosa and induce changes in barrier function by producing enterotoxin or by direct invasion of the intestinal epithelium. Our hypothesis was that L. reuteri can protect the mucosal barrier, and the goal of the study was to challenge this hypothesis by monitoring the protective effect of L. reuteri strains on epithelial dysfunction caused by ETEC. Using an infection model based on the porcine intestinal cell line IPEC-J2, it was demonstrated that pretreatment of the cells with human-derived L. reuteri strains (ATCC PTA 6475, DSM 17938 and 1563F) and a rat strain (R2LC) reduced the detrimental effect of ETEC in a dose-dependent manner, as monitored by permeability of FITC-dextran and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Moreover, the results revealed that ETEC upregulated proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα and decreased expression of the shorter isoform of ZO-1 (187 kDa) and E-cadherin. In contrast, pretreatment with L. reuteri DSM 17938 and 1563F downregulated expression of IL-6 and TNFα, and led to an increase in production of the longer isoform of ZO-1 (195 kDa) and maintained E-cadherin expression. Interestingly, expression of ZO-1 (187 kDa) was preserved only when the infected cells were pretreated with strain 1563F. These findings demonstrate that L. reuteri strains exert a protective effect against ETEC-induced mucosal integrity disruption.© 2018 The Authors.

Emerging evidence suggests that modifying the composition of the  microbiota via probiotic supplementation may be a viable adjuvant treatment option for individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Convergent evidence indicates that persistent low-grade inflammatory activation is associated with the diagnosis of MDD as well as the severity of depressive symptoms and probability of treatment response. The objectives of this review are to (1) evaluate the evidence supporting an anti-inflammatory effect of probiotics and () describe immune system modulation as a potential mechanism for the therapeutic effects of probiotics in populations with MDD. A narrative review of studies investigating the effects of probiotics on systemic inflammation was conducted. Studies were identified using PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov (from inception to November 2017) using the following search terms (and/or variants): probiotic, inflammation,  microbiota, and depression. The available evidence suggests that probiotics should be considered a promising adjuvant treatment to reduce the inflammatory activation commonly found in MDD. Several controversial points remain to be addressed including the role of  , the role of stress exposure, and the role of blood-brain-barrier permeability. Taken together, the results of this review suggest that probiotics may be a potentially beneficial, but insufficiently studied, antidepressant treatment intervention.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Emerging evidence reveals that ethanol administration disrupts the intestinal epithelial tight junction (TJ) complex; this defect allows for the paracellular translocation of -derived pathogenic molecules to reach the liver to cause inflammation and progressive liver injury. We have previously demonstrated a causative role of impairments in liver transmethylation reactions in the pathogenesis of ALD. We have further shown that treatment with betaine, a methylation agent that normalizes liver methylation potential, can attenuate ethanol-induced liver injury. Herein, we explored whether alterations in methylation reactions play a causative role in disrupting intestinal mucosal barrier function by employing an intestinal epithelial cell line. Monolayers of Caco- cells were exposed to ethanol or a-pan methylation reaction inhibitor, tubercidin, in the presence and absence of betaine. The structural and functional integrity of intestinal epithelial barrier was then examined. We observed that exposure to either ethanol or tubercidin disrupted TJ integrity and function by decreasing the localization of TJ protein occludin-1 to the intracellular junctions, reducing transepithelial electrical resistance and increasing dextran influx. All these detrimental effects of ethanol and tubercidin were attenuated by co-treatment with betaine. We further show that the mechanism of betaine protection was through BHMT-mediated catalysis. Collectively, our data suggest a novel mechanism for alcohol-induced  leakiness and identifies the importance of normal methylation reactions in maintaining TJ integrity. We also propose betaine as a potential therapeutic option for   in alcohol-consuming patients who are at the risk of developing ALD.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30256966>Effects of zinc amino acid complex on biomarkers of  integrity and metabolism during and following heat stress or feed restriction in pigs.</a></h1><p>Study objectives were to determine the effects of zinc (Zn) amino acid complex (Availa Zn, Zinpro Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN) on metabolism, biomarkers of  , and inflammation during and following heat stress (HS) and nutrient restriction.

The study consisted of 3 experimental periods (P): during P1 (7 d), all pigs were fed their respective diets ad libitum and housed in TN conditions (20.84 ± 0.03 °C, 47.11 ± 0.42% relative humidity). During P2 (7 d), HSCtl and HSZn pigs were exposed to progressive cyclical HS conditions (27 to 30 °C, 41.9 ± 0.5% relative humidity), while TNCtl, PFCtl, and PFZn pigs remained in TN conditions and were fed ad libitum or pair-fed to their respective HSCtl and HSZn counterparts. During P3 (5 d; "recovery phase"), all pigs were housed in TN conditions and fed ad libitum. Pigs exposed to HS had overall increased rectal temperature, skin temperature, and respiration rate (0.33 °C, 3.76 °C, and 27 bpm, respectively; P < 0.01). Relative to TN controls, HS decreased ADFI and ADG (28 and 35%, respectively; P < 0.05), but these variables were unaffected by dietary treatment. Additionally, circulating insulin did not differ between HS and TN pigs (P = 0.41), but was decreased in PF relative to TN pigs (P < 0.01). During recovery, no differences were observed in rectal temperature or respiration rate across treatments, but HSZn pigs had decreased skin temperature relative to TN, PF, and HSCtl pigs (P < 0.01). During P3, no Zn effects were observed in production parameters; however, PF pigs had increased ADFI and ADG relative to TN and HS treatments (P < 0.01). During P3, circulating insulin was increased in pigs that were HS relative to TN and PF pigs (75%, P < 0.05). Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) levels were decreased during P3 (P = 0.04) in Zn relative to Ctl-fed pigs.

However, the impact of intestinal microbiota development on intestinal mucosal barrier maturation has not been evaluated in this population. In this study, we investigated a longitudinally sampled cohort of 38 preterm infants < 33 weeks gestation monitored for intestinal permeability (IP) and fecal microbiota during the first  weeks of life. Rapid decrease in IP indicating intestinal barrier function maturation correlated with significant increase in community diversity. In particular, members of the Clostridiales and  were highly transcriptionally active, and progressively increasing abundance in Clostridiales was significantly associated with decreased intestinal permeability. Further, neonatal factors previously identified to promote intestinal barrier maturation, including early exclusive breastmilk feeding and shorter duration antibiotic exposure, associate with the early colonization of the intestinal microbiota by members of the Clostridiales, which altogether are associated with improved intestinal barrier function in preterm infants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28868181>Oral spore-based probiotic supplementation was associated with reduced incidence of post-prandial dietary endotoxin, triglycerides, and disease risk biomarkers.</a></h1><p>To determine if 30-d of oral spore-based probiotic supplementation could reduce dietary endotoxemia.Apparently healthy men and women ( = 75) were screened for post-prandial dietary endotoxemia. Subjects whose serum endotoxin concentration increased by at least 5-fold from pre-meal levels at 5-h post-prandial were considered "responders" and were randomized to receive either placebo (rice flour) or a commercial spore-based probiotic supplement [Bacillus indicus (HU36), Bacillus subtilis (HU58), Bacillus coagulans, and Bacillus licheniformis, and Bacillus clausii] for 30-d.

Severe thermal injury triggers intestinal inflammation that contributes to intestinal epithelial hyperpermeability, which exacerbates systemic response leading to multiple organ failure and sepsis. In this study, we identified a significant function of a particular palmitoyl acyltransferase, zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein-21 (ZDHHC21), in mediating signaling events required for  hyperpermeability induced by inflammation. Using quantitative PCR, we show that ZDHHC21 mRNA production was enhanced twofold when intestinal epithelial cells were treated with TNF-α-IFN-γ in vitro. In addition, pharmacological targeting of palmitoyl acyltransferases with -bromopalmitate (-BP) showed significant improvement in TNF-α-IFN-γ-mediated epithelial barrier dysfunction by using electric cell-substrate impedance-sensing assays, as well as FITC-labeled dextran permeability assays. Using acyl-biotin exchange assay and click chemistry, we show that TNF-α-IFN-γ treatment of intestinal epithelial cells results in enhanced detection of total palmitoylated proteins and this response is inhibited by -BP. Using ZDHHC21-deficient mice or wild-type mice treated with -BP, we showed that mice with impaired ZDHHC21 expression or pharmacological inhibition resulted in attenuated intestinal barrier dysfunction caused by thermal injury. Moreover, hematoxylin and eosin staining of the small intestine, as well as transmission electron microscopy, showed that mice with genetic interruption of ZDHHC21 had attenuated villus structure disorganization associated with thermal injury-induced intestinal barrier damage. Taken together, these results suggest an important role of ZDHHC21 in mediating  hyperpermeability resulting from thermal injury. Increased mucosal permeability in the  is one of the major complications following severe burn. Here we report the novel finding that zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein-21 (ZDHHC21) mediates  epithelial hyperpermeability resulting from an experimental model of thermal injury. The hyperpermeability response was significantly attenuated with a pharmacological inhibitor of palmitoyl acyltransferases and in mice with genetic ablation of ZDHHC21. These findings suggest that ZDHHC21 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for treating burn-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25591964>Simultaneous gas-chromatographic urinary measurement of sugar probes to assess intestinal permeability: use of time course analysis to optimize its use to assess regional  permeability.</a></h1><p>Measurement of intestinal permeability is important in several diseases but currently several methods are employed. We sought to: (1) develop a new GC based method to measure urinary mannitol, lactulose and sucralose to assess regional and total  permeability; () analyze the kinetics of these sugars in the urine to determine which ratio is useful to represent intestinal permeability; and (3) determine whether age, gender, race and BMI impact these values.Subjects drank a cocktail of sucrose, lactulose, mannitol and sucralose and these sugars were measured in the urine at 5, 12 and 24h with gas chromatography.Urinary mannitol exhibited significantly different kinetics than lactulose and sucralose which were similar to each other and varied little over the 24h. No permeability differences were observed for renal function, age, race, sex, or BMI.Our data do not support the use of the widely used L/M ratio as an accurate estimate of intestinal permeability. Our data support the use of: the sucralose/lactulose (S/M) ratio to measure: small intestine permeability (first 5h); small and large intestine (first 12h), and total  permeability (24h).

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) may enter the blood stream through the morphologically altered and   barrier. We hypothesized that lower LPS reactivity would be associated with worse survival as compared to normal or higher LPS reactivity.LPS responsiveness was studied in 122 patients with chronic HF (mean±SD: age 67.3±10.3 years, 24 female, New York Heart Association class [NYHA] class: .5±0.8, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]: 33.5±12.5%) and 27 control subjects of similar age (63.7±7.7 years, p>0.05). Reference LPS was added at increasing doses to ex vivo whole blood samples and necrosis factor-α (TNFα) was measured. Patients were subgrouped into good- and poor-responder status according to their potential to react to increasing doses of LPS (delta TNFα secretion). The optimal cut-off value was calculated by receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis.A total of 56 patients with chronic HF died from any cause during follow-up. At 24 months, cumulative mortality was 16.4% (95% confidence interval 16.0-16.7%). The delta TNFα value representing the optimal cut-off for the prediction of mortality was 1522 pg/mL (24 months) with a sensitivity of 49.3% (95% confidence interval 37.-61.4%) and specificity of 81.5% (95% confidence interval 61.9-93.6%).

SHANK3 mutations are associated with autism, and patients with autism are known to have higher proportions of inflammatory bowel disease. Here, we explore the role of SHANK3 in inflammatory bowel disease, both in vivo and in vitro.Dextran sulfate sodium colitis was induced in SHANK3 knockout mice. Transepithelial electrical resistance, paracellular permeability, and Salmonella invasion assays were used to evaluate epithelial barrier function, in vitro and in vivo. Expression of tight junction proteins, protein kinases, and MAP kinase phosphorylation changes were analyzed by immunoblotting after overexpression or knockdown of SHANK3 expression. SHANK3 expression in intestinal tissue from patients with Crohn's disease was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.SHANK3 knockout mice were more susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium. SHANK3 knockout resulted in a  epithelial barrier phenotype, as demonstrated by decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, increased paracellular permeability, and increased Salmonella invasion. Overexpression of SHANK3 enhanced ZO-1 expression, and knockdown of SHANK3 resulted in decreased expression of ZO-1. Regulation of ZO-1 expression by SHANK3 seems to be mediated through a PKCε-dependent pathway. SHANK3 expression correlated with ZO-1 and PKCε in colonic tissue of patients with Crohn's disease.The expression level of SHANK3 affects ZO-1 expression and the barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells.

Our objective was to describe the effects of critical illness on duodenal morphology and ultrastructure.Prospective observational study of 12 mechanically ventilated critically ill patients in an intensive care unit and 15 control participants in an outpatient endoscopy suite.We took six endoscopic biopsy samples of the duodenum from each participant for analysis by electron and light microscopy.Our primary outcome was tight junction morphology, examined with electron microscopy. Secondary outcomes were microvillus length and density, vascular endothelium morphology and mitochondrial density and morphology, examined with electron microscopy, and morphology examined with light microscopy.We observed no abnormalities of tight junction ultrastructure in either group. There was a tendency towards shorter microvilli in the critically ill group: mean length in critically ill patients, 1.17 µm (interquartile range [IQR], 1.05-1.60 µm) v mean length in control patients, 1.58 µm (IQR, 1.30-1.72 µm); P = 0.07. There was a tendency towards less dense microvilli in the critically ill group: mean density in critically ill patients, 7.29 microvilli/µm (IQR, 6.83-8.05 microvilli/µm) v mean density in control patients, 8.23 microvilli/µm (IQR, 7.34-9.11 microvilli/µm); P = 0.07. Vascular endothelium appeared normal in all critically ill patients and abnormal in one control participant.

It is long appreciated that bacterial metabolites affect the host's physiology. The inner lining of the intestinal tract is the first level of interaction between the host and bacteria and their metabolites. Therefore, we set out to test the effects of five common dietary fibres (oat β-glucan 28%; oat β-glucan 94%; dried chicory root containing inulin 75%; xylo-oligosaccharide; inulin 90%) and maltodextrin, after fermentation by human  microbiota in vitro, on measures of  barrier integrity using a Caco-/HT29-MTX co-culture as well as mucus production and immune parameters using HT29-MTX and HT29 cell models, respectively. Our data show that all fibres, fermentation products increased the tightness of the  barrier with oat β-glucan 28% having the largest effect. Fermentation supernatants were tested also in models of the compromised  barrier ( ). After the addition of ethanol as basolateral stressor, only fermentation supernatant of oat β-glucan 28%, oat β-glucan 94% and maltodextrin improved the  barrier integrity, while oat β-glucan 28% and dried chicory root containing inulin 75% significantly improved the  barrier integrity after addition of rhamnolipids as apical stressor. Using the Luminex Technology, we demonstrated an important role of oat β-glucan fermentation products in modulating cytokine and chemokine productions. Furthermore, treating the goblet cells with effluent from xylo-oligosaccharide fermentation significantly increased mucus production.

Here we examine whether (deficit) schizophrenia is accompanied by  paracellular, transcellular, and vascular barriers in the  and blood-brain barriers. We measured IgA responses to occludin, claudin-5, E-cadherin, and β-catenin (paracellular pathway, PARA); talin, actin, vinculin, and epithelial intermediate filament (transcellular pathway, TRANS); and plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP, vascular pathway) in 78 schizophrenia patients and 40 controls. IgA responses to claudin-5, E-cadherin, and β-catenin, the sum of the four PARA proteins, and the ratio PARA/TRANS were significantly higher in deficit schizophrenia patients than in nondeficit schizophrenia patients and controls. A large part of the variance in PHEMN (psychosis, hostility, excitation, mannerism, and negative) symptoms, psychomotor retardation, formal thought disorders, verbal fluency, word list memory, word list recall, and executive functions was explained by the PARA/TRANS ratio coupled with plasma IgA responses to Gram-negative bacteria, IgM to malondialdehyde, CCL-11 (eotaxin), IgA levels of the ratio of noxious to more protective tryptophan catabolites (NOX/PRO TRYCATs), and a plasma immune activation index. Moreover, IgA levels to Gram-negative bacteria were significantly associated with IgA to E-cadherin, β-catenin, and PLVAP, while IgA levels to claudin-5 were significantly predicted by IgA to E-cadherin, NOX/PRO TRYCAT ratio, Gram-negative bacteria, and CCL11. The phenomenology of the deficit syndrome is to a large extent explained by the cumulative effects of lowered natural IgM, breakdown of the paracellular and vascular pathways, increased bacterial translocation, peripheral immune-inflammatory responses, and indices of BBB breakdown.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27847926>The brain- axis dysfunctions and hypersensitivity to food antigens in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia.</a></h1><p>Despite over 100-year history of research on schizophrenia, its etiology is still not fully understood, which might be due to the significant heterogeneity in terms of both its course, as well as the etiopathogenesis. One of the best-proven mediating mechanisms in the development of schizophrenia is the immuno-inflammatory response, the sources of which are believed to be the dysfunctions of brain- axis and pathological processes occurring in the intestines. This paper is a review of the literature on this subject which presents factors both involved in the functioning of brain- axis and important for the development of schizophrenia, i.e. 1. intestinal microbiome (intestinal microbiota), . permeable intestine (  syndrome), 3. hypersensitivity to food antigens, including gluten and casein of cow's milk. Research results seem to be very promising and indicate the possibility of improved clinical outcomes in some patients with schizophrenia by modifying diet, use of probiotics, and the implementation of antibiotic therapy of specific treatment groups.

Globally, it affects 30⁻50 million individuals, with an estimated increase of approximately 200 million by 2020 and approximately 300 million by 2040. Currently, the neovascular form may be able to be treated with the use of anti-VEGF drugs, while no effective treatments are available for the dry form. Many studies, such as the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS , have shown a potential role of micronutrient supplementation in lowering the risk of progression of the early stages of AMD. Recently, low-grade inflammation, sustained by dysbiosis and a  , has been shown to contribute to the development of AMD. Given the ascertained influence of the  microbiota in systemic low-grade inflammation and its potential modulation by macro- and micro-nutrients, a potential role of diet in AMD has been proposed. This review discusses the role of the  microbiota in the development of AMD.

Age-associated deterioration of gastrointestinal function could be ascribed to the inflammaging, although evidence is yet to emerge.

This alteration was ascribed to up-regulation of angiopoetin- in microvascular endothelial cells. Up-regulation of the angiopoietin- was by TNF-α, originated from M2-like residential CD206 macrophages, proportion of which increases as animal ages. It was concluded that antigenic burdens encountered in intestine throughout life create the condition of chronic stage of inflammation, which accumulates M2-like macrophages expressing TNF-α.

We evaluated the effect of DIM on the intestinal permeability of human intestinal cell monolayers and the animal model  which were treated with IL-1β and , respectively, to mimic IBD conditions. DIM substantially restored the intestinal permeability of differentiated Caco- cells by enhancing the expression of tight junction proteins (including occludin and ZO-1). Compared to the IL-1β single treatment (551.0 ± 49.0 Ω·cm), DIM (10 μM) significantly increased the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of Caco- cell monolayers (919.0 ± 66.4 Ω·cm,  < 0.001). DIM also ameliorated the impaired intestinal permeability and extended the lifespan of  fed . The mean lifespan of DIM-treated worms (10.8 ± 1.3 days) was higher than that of control-treated worms (9.7 ± 1.1 days,  < 0.01).

While alcohol ingestion can affect many organs and systems, clinical and preclinical studies indicate that alcohol ingestion can cause a ' ' syndrome which in turn contributes to infection and systemic organ dysfunction. This study investigated the acute effect of alcohol on  barrier function. Using an in vivo isolated  sac model of naïve male rats, each individual  sac was injected with different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, and 40%, v/v) of alcohol. After different times of alcohol exposure, each isolated  segment was harvested and intestinal permeability and mucosal surface hydrophobicity (a physiologic marker of mucus barrier function) were measured as well as luminal DNA, mucus, protein and free fatty acids. The results showed that alcohol caused dose-dependent and time-dependent increases in  permeability and decreases in mucosal surface hydrophobicity, with significant changes to be observed 5 min after treatment with 10% alcohol. In addition, it is further found that these changes in permeability and hydrophobicity are more closely associated with increased intestinal luminal free fatty acids levels but not protein or DNA levels. These results suggest that alcohol may cause loss of  barrier function by extracting and dissolving lipids from the mucus with a resultant decrease in mucosal surface hydrophobicity, which is a critical component of  barrier function.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Period 1 (5 d) served as the baseline for period  (7 d), during which cows received 1 of  i.v. treatments twice per day: sterile saline or a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI; 1.5 mg/kg of body weight). Gamma-secretase inhibitors reduce intestinal barrier function by inhibiting crypt cell differentiation into absorptive enterocytes. During period , control cows receiving sterile saline were pair-fed (PF) to the GSI-treated cows, and all cows were killed at the end of period . Administering GSI increased goblet cell area 218, 70, and 28% in jejunum, ileum, and colon, respectively. In the jejunum, GSI-treated cows had increased crypt depth and reduced villus height, villus height-to-crypt depth ratio, cell proliferation, and mucosal surface area. Plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein increased with time, and tended to be increased 42% in GSI-treated cows relative to PF controls on d 5 to 7. Circulating haptoglobin and serum amyloid A concentrations increased (585- and 4.4-fold, respectively) similarly in both treatments. Administering GSI progressively reduced dry matter intake (66%) and, by design, the pattern and magnitude of decreased nutrient intake was similar in PF controls. A similar progressive decrease (42%) in milk yield occurred in both treatments, but we observed no treatment effects on milk components. Cows treated with GSI tended to have increased plasma insulin (68%) and decreased circulating nonesterified fatty acids (29%) compared with PF cows. For both treatments, plasma glucose decreased with time while β-hydroxybutyrate progressively increased. Liver triglycerides increased 221% from period 1 to sacrifice in both treatments. No differences were detected in liver weight, liver moisture, or body weight change. Intentionally compromising intestinal barrier function caused inflammation, altered metabolism, and markedly reduced feed intake and milk yield. Further, we demonstrated that progressive feed reduction appeared to cause   and inflammation.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

All patients reduced their weight to a mean ± SD BMI of 36.4 ± 5.1 within 12 mo. We assessed barrier functions by the oral Lac:Man and the fecal zonulin tests. Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostatic model assessment index (HOMA), and liver steatosis by sonography and the fatty liver index (FLI).The Lac:Man ratio and circulating interleukin (IL) 6 concentration decreased during intervention from 0.080 (95% CI: 0.073, 0.093) to 0.027 (95% CI: 0.024, 0.034; P < 0.001) and from 4. ± 1.4 to .8 ± 1.6 pg/mL (P < 0.01), respectively. At study start, the Lac:Man ratio was higher in patients with moderate or severe steatosis than in those without any steatosis (P < 0.001). The Lac:Man ratio tended to correlate with HOMA (ρ = 0.55, P = 0.052), which correlated with FLI (ρ = 0.75, P < 0.01). A multiple-regression analysis led to a final model explaining FLI best through BMI, waist circumference, and the Lac:Man ratio.Intestinal permeability is increased in obese patients with steatosis compared with obese patients without. The increased permeability fell to within the previously reported normal range after weight reduction. The data suggest that a   barrier is linked with liver steatosis and could be a new target for future steatosis therapies.

We investigated whether impaired intestinal permeability contributes to these symptoms.We performed a prospective study of intestinal permeability, measured by endoscopic confocal laser endomicroscopy in 110 consecutive subjects (31 with ulcerative colitis [UC], 57 with Crohn's disease [CD], and 22 healthy individuals [controls]) in Sydney, Australia from May 2009 and September 2015. Symptomatic CD was defined by a CD Activity Index score of 150 or more and symptomatic UC by a partial Mayo score of  or more. Mucosal healing was defined as CD Endoscopic Index of Severity of 0 in CD or Mayo endoscopic sub-score of 0-1 for patients with UC. Intestinal permeability was quantified by the Confocal Leak Score (CLS; range: 0=no impaired permeability to 100=complete loss of barrier function). The primary endpoint was intestinal permeability in patients with symptomatic IBD in mucosal healing vs patients with asymptomatic IBD in mucosal healing. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of CLS in determining symptoms based on receiver operating characteristic analysis.Ongoing bowel symptoms were present in 16.3% of patients with IBD and mucosal healing (15.4% of patients with CD, 17.4% with UC). Patients with symptomatic IBD had a significantly higher median CLS (19.0) than patients with asymptomatic IBD (7.3; P < .001) or controls (5.9, P < .001). There were no significant differences between patients with IBD in remission vs controls (P = .261). Median CLS was significantly higher in patients with symptomatic than asymptomatic CD (17.7 vs 8.1; P = .009) and patients with symptomatic than asymptomatic UC (22. vs 6.9; P = .021). A CLS of 13.1 or more identified ongoing bowel symptoms in patients with IBD and mucosal healing with 95.% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity; the receiver operating characteristic area under curve value was 0.88. Based on this cutoff, 36.% of patients with IBD in mucosal healing have increased intestinal permeability. On regression analysis, every increase in CLS of 1.9 correlated with an additional diarrheal motion per day (P = .008).In a prospective study of intestinal permeability in patients with IBD and mucosal healing, we associated impaired intestinal permeability with ongoing bowel symptoms; increases in permeability correlated with increased severity of diarrhea. Resolution of mucosal permeability beyond mucosal healing might improve outcomes of patients with IDB (ANZCTR.org.au: ACTRN12613001248752).Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Our aim was to investigate the potential role of a ClC- chloride channel activator, lubiprostone, which is reported to have beneficial effects on LGS, in the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice. After a 15-week feeding period of a Western diet (WD), ApoE-/- mice were treated with a Western-type diet (WD) alone or WD with oral supplementation of lubiprostone for 10 weeks. This feeding protocol was followed by experimental evaluation of LGS and atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta. In mice with lubiprostone, in vivo translocation of orally administered 4-kDa FITC-dextran was significantly improved, and RNA expression of the epithelial tight junction proteins, Zo-1 and occludin, was significantly up-regulated in the ileum, compared to the WD alone group, suggesting a possible reversal of WD-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. As a result, WD-induced exacerbation of atherosclerotic lesion formation was reduced by 69% in longitudinally opened aortas and 26% in aortic root regions. In addition, there was a significant decrease in circulating immunoglobulin level, followed by an attenuation of inflammatory responses in the perivascular adipose tissue, as evidenced by reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Lubiprostone attenuates atherosclerosis by ameliorating LGS-induced inflammation through the restoration of the intestinal barrier. These findings raise the possibility of targeting LGS for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29705456>Investigation into complementary and integrative medicine practitioners' clinical experience of intestinal permeability: A cross-sectional survey.</a></h1><p>This study aims to explore the conditions complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) practitioners associate with increased intestinal permeability (IP) and the methods they employ to assess IP.A cross-sectional survey of naturopaths, nutritionists and Western herbal medicine practitioners was undertaken (n = 227) through the Practitioner Research and Collaboration Initiative (PRACI) network.CIM practitioners (n = 36, response rate 15.9%) associate IP with gastrointestinal (100.0%), autoimmune (91.7%), skin (91.7%), neurological (80.6%), respiratory (55.6%) and liver-related conditions (44.4%). CIM practitioners frequently treat IP (72.7%); observing a minimum 3 months of treatment is required to resolve IP. Patient's signs and symptoms were the main reasons CIM practitioners suspected IP (94.1%).CIM practitioners observe a clinical link between IP and a wide range of conditions, including those not yet recognised within the literature. The clinical experience of CIM practitioners holds substantial value to the advancement of research and the clinical management of IP.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Results of an uncontrolled observational study with 1,020 patients].</a></h1><p>Patients with migraine often also suffer from gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease. All these diseases share increased intestinal permeability (" ") and thus increased inflammatory activity. There is an increase in proinflammatoric cytokines in the serum, which in turn can trigger migraine attacks. Probiotics can have a positive effect on the intestinal epithelium and reduce inflammatory activity. A first uncontrolled, small study of 39 migraineurs showed a decrease in the rate of attacks under the daily intake of a probiotic.In an uncontrolled observational study, the influence of a specially formulated multispecies probiotic on the frequency of migraine attacks and the intensity of migraine-associated complaints was recorded. The self-assessment of 1,020 patients was evaluated.Over the treatment period of 8 weeks, the number of headache days was reduced from  to 1.4 days per week. The headache intensity decreased from 5.1 to .1 points (0 = not present to 6 = very intensive). The migraine-associated complaints were reduced and the use of painkillers halved. All results were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.001).It can be suggested that this multispecies probiotic formulation has a positive influence on intensity and frequency of migraine attacks. However, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are required for further confirmation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288283>[Microbiome & NASH - partners in crime driving progression of fatty liver disease].</a></h1><p>Along with the increasing prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type  diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly increasing and poses a major challenge for gastroenterologists. Many studies have demonstrated that the microbiome is closely associated with the progression of nutrition-related diseases, especially of fatty liver disease. Changes in the quantity and quality of the intestinal flora, commonly referred to as dysbiosis, result in altered food metabolism, increased permeability of the intestinal barrier (" ") and consecutive inflammatory processes in the liver. This favors both the progression of obesity and metabolic disorders as well as NAFLD towards non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Important molecular mechanisms include microbial metabolites, microbial and endogenous signaling substances (so-called PAMPs/DAMPs) as well as bile acids. Essential cellular mechanisms include immune cells in the  and liver, especially macrophages and Kupffer cells, as well as intestinal epithelial cells and hepatocytes as central regulators of metabolism. In this review article, we briefly summarize the relevant species of the human microbiome, describe the microbial analytics, explain the most important molecular relationships between microbiome and NAFLD/NASH, and finally the opportunities and challenges of microbiome-modulating therapy for the treatment of fatty liver disease.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26207424>The Role of miR-212 and iNOS in Alcohol-Induced Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction and Steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Alcoholic liver disease is commonly associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction. Alcohol-induced dysregulation of intestinal tight junction proteins, such as Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1), plays an important role in alcohol-induced  leakiness. However, the mechanism of alcohol-induced disruption of tight junction proteins is not well established. The goal of this study was to elucidate this mechanism by studying the role of microRNA 212 (miR-212) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in alcohol-induced  leakiness.The permeability of the Caco- monolayer was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance and flux of fluorescein sulfonic acid. miR-212 was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The wild-type, iNOS knockout, and miR-212 knockdown mice were fed with alcohol diet (29% of total calories, 4.5% v/v) for 8 weeks. The LNA-anti-miR-212 was used to inhibit miR-212 expression in mice. The alcohol-induced intestinal permeability, miR-212 expression, and liver injuries in mice were measured.Our in vitro monolayer and in vivo mice studies showed that: (i) alcohol-induced overexpression of the intestinal miR-212 and intestinal hyperpermeability is prevented using miR-212 knockdown techniques; and (ii) iNOS is up-regulated in the intestine by alcohol and that iNOS signaling is required for alcohol-induced miR-212 overexpression, ZO-1 disruption,  leakiness, and steatohepatitis.These studies thus support a novel miR-212 mechanism for alcohol-induced  leakiness and a potential target that could be exploited for therapeutic intervention to prevent   and liver injury in alcoholics.Copyright © 2015 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25869282>The effects of the multispecies probiotic mixture Ecologic®Barrier on migraine: results of an open-label pilot study.</a></h1><p>Migraine prevalence is associated with gastrointestinal disorders. Possible underlying mechanisms could be increased  permeability and inflammation. Probiotics may decrease intestinal permeability as well as inflammation, and therefore may reduce the frequency and/or intensity of migraine attacks. Therefore we assessed feasibility, possible clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions of probiotic treatment in migraine patients. 29 migraine patients took  g/d of a probiotic food supplement (Ecologic(®)Barrier, .5×10(9) cfu/g) during 12 weeks. Participants recorded frequency and intensity of migraine in a headache diary and completed the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) and Henry Ford Hospital Headache Disability Inventory (HDI) at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Compliance was measured every 4 weeks by counting the remaining sachets with probiotics. The study was completed by 27/29 (93%) patients who took 95% of the supplements. Obstipation was reported by 4 patients during the first  weeks of treatment only. The mean±standard deviation (SD) number of migraine days/month decreased significantly from 6.7±.4 at baseline to 5.1±. (P=0.008) in week 5-8 and 5.±.4 in week 9-12 (P=0.001). The mean±SD intensity of migraine decreased significantly from 6.3±1.5 at baseline to 5.5±1.9 after treatment (P=0.005). The MIDAS score improved from 24.8±25.5 to 16.6±13.5 (P=0.031). However, the mean HDI did not change significantly. In conclusion, probiotics may decrease migraine supporting a possible role for the intestine in migraine management. Feasibility and lack of adverse reactions justify further placebo-controlled studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28766554>Campylobacter jejuni impairs sodium transport and epithelial barrier function via cytokine release in human colon.</a></h1><p>Campylobacter jejuni is the most prevalent cause of foodborne bacterial enteritis worldwide. Patients present with diarrhea and immune responses lead to complications like arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. Although studies exist in animal and cell models, we aimed at a functional and structural characterization of intestinal dysfunction and the involved regulatory mechanisms in human colon. First, in patients' colonic biopsies, sodium malabsorption was identified as an important diarrheal mechanism resulting from hampered epithelial ion transport via impaired epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) β- and γ-subunit. In addition, barrier dysfunction from disrupted epithelial tight junction proteins (claudin-1, -3, -4, -5, and -8), epithelial apoptosis, and appearance of lesions was detected, which cause leak-flux diarrhea and can perpetuate immune responses. Importantly, these effects in human biopsies either represent direct action of Campylobacter jejuni (ENaC impairment) or are caused by proinflammatory signaling (barrier dysfunction). This was revealed by regulator analysis from RNA-sequencing (cytometric bead array-checked) and confirmed in cell models, which identified interferon-γ, TNFα, IL-13, and IL-1β. Finally, bioinformatics' predictions yielded additional information on protective influences like vitamin D, which was confirmed in cell models.

The etiology of AIH still remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation, and intestinal microbiome in patients with AIH and to evaluate the correlations of those changes with the stages of the disease.24 patients with autoimmune hepatitis and 8 healthy volunteers were recruited for this study. We assessed (1) the integrity of tight junctions within the  by immunohistochemical analysis of zona occludens-1 and occludin expression in duodenal biopsy specimens; () changes in the enteric microbiome by 16S rDNA quantitative PCR; and (3) the presence of bacterial translocation by the level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using ELISA.Increased intestinal permeability, derangement of the microbiome and bacterial translocation occurred in AIH, which correlated with the severity of the disease.Autoimmune hepatitis is associated with   and intestinal microbiome dysbiosis.

Portal hypertension leads to increased bacterial translocation from the intestine. Failure to eliminate invading pathogens due to immune defects associated with advanced liver disease on the background of genetic predisposition may result in SBP. The efficacy of antibiotic treatment and prophylaxis has declined due to the spread of multi-resistant bacteria. Patients with nosocomial SBP and with prior antibiotic treatment are at a particularly high risk for infection with resistant bacteria. Therefore, it is important to adapt empirical treatment to these risk factors and to the local resistance profile. Rifaximin, an oral, non-absorbable antibiotic, has been proposed to prevent SBP, but may be useful only in a subset of patients. Since novel antibiotic classes are lacking, we have to develop prophylactic strategies which do not induce bacterial resistance. Farnesoid X receptor agonists may be a candidate, but so far, clinical studies are not available. New diagnostic tests which can be carried out quickly at the patient's site and provide additional prognostic information would be helpful. Furthermore, we need tools to predict antibiotic resistance in order to tailor first-line antibiotic treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis to the individual patient and to reduce mortality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27892878>Inflammatory biomarkers are associated with ketosis in periparturient Holstein cows.</a></h1><p>Ketosis is a prevalent periparturient metabolic disorder and we hypothesize that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infiltration may play a key role in its etiology. Study objectives were to characterize biomarkers of inflammation during the transition period in healthy and clinically diagnosed ketotic cows. Cows were retrospectively categorized into one of two groups: healthy and clinically diagnosed ketotic. Two data sets were utilized; the first dataset (Study A) was obtained as a subset of cows (n=16) enrolled in a larger experiment conducted at the Iowa State University Dairy utilizing Holstein cows (8 healthy; 8 ketotic), and the second dataset (Study B; 22 healthy; 22 ketotic) was obtained from a commercial farm. For both experiments, blood samples were collected prior to and following calving. Ketotic cows in both studies had reduced milk production compared to healthy cows (P<0.01). Post-calving, ketotic cows had increased serum amyloid A (4. and 1.8 fold in studies A and B, respectively; P=0.03 and P=0.04), haptoglobin (>6 fold and ~4 fold; P=0.04 and P=0.03), and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (66 and 45%; P<0.01 and P=0.02) compared with their healthy counterparts. Antepartum circulating LPS in ketotic cows was increased (.3 fold; P=0.01) compared to healthy cows in Study B. In summary, increased biomarkers of inflammation appear to be closely associated with ketosis in transition dairy cows.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the , these silicates could act as adsorbents, ion-exchangers, catalysts, detergents or anti-diarrheic agents. This study evaluated whether zeolite supplementation affects biomarkers of intestinal wall permeability and parameters of oxidation and inflammation in aerobically trained individuals, and whether it could improve their performance.In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial, 52 endurance trained men and women, similar in body fat, non-smokers, 20-50 years, received 1.85 g of zeolite per day for 12 weeks. Stool samples for determination of intestinal wall integrity biomarkers were collected. From blood, markers of redox biology, inflammation, and DNA damage were determined at the beginning and the end of the study. In addition, VO2max and maximum performance were evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. For statistical analyses a -factor ANOVA was used.At baseline both groups showed slightly increased stool zonulin concentrations above normal. After 12 weeks with zeolite zonulin was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the supplemented group. IL-10 increased tendentially (p < 0.1) in the zeolite group. There were no significant changes observed in the other measured parameters.Twelve weeks of zeolite supplementation exerted beneficial effects on intestinal wall integrity as indicated via decreased concentrations of the tight junction modulator zonulin. This was accompanied by mild anti-inflammatory effects in this cohort of aerobically trained subjects.

Indeed, commensal fungi and opportunistic bacteria stimulate the local immune system, altering intestinal permeability with consequent  , which in turn activates systemic inflammation responsible for insulin resistance. It is also well known that chronic exercise improves glucose control and diabetes-induced damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of chronic exercise on  flora composition and   in T2D stable patients.Thirty clinically stable patients with T2D were studied before and after a six months program of endurance, resistance and flexibility training. Metabolic and anthropometric evaluations were carried out.  flora and intestinal permeability were measured in stools by selective agar culture medium and molecular biology measurements of zonulin, which is the protein that modulates enterocyte tight junctions.Diabetes causes significant intestinal mycetes overgrowth, increased intestinal permeability and systemic low-grade inflammation. However, exercise improved glycemia, functional and anthropometric variables. Moreover, chronic exercise reduced intestinal mycetes overgrowth,  , and systemic inflammation. Interestingly, these variables are closely correlated.Exercise controls diabetes by also modifying intestinal microbiota composition and  barrier function. This data shows an additional mechanism of chronic exercise and suggests that improving  flora could be an important step in tailored therapies of T2D.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26488575>Inhibition of Matriptase Activity Results in Decreased Intestinal Epithelial Monolayer Integrity In Vitro.</a></h1><p>Barrier dysfunction in inflammatory bowel diseases implies enhanced paracellular flux and lowered transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) causing effective invasion of enteropathogens or altered intestinal absorption of toxins and drug compounds. To elucidate the role of matriptase-driven cell surface proteolysis in the maintenance of intestinal barrier function, the 3-amidinophenylalanine-derived matriptase inhibitor, MI-432 was used on porcine IPEC-J2 cell monolayer. Studies with two fluorescent probes revealed that short ( h) treatment with MI-432 caused an altered distribution of oxidative species between intracellular and extracellular spaces in IPEC-J2 cells. This perturbation was partially compensated when administration of inhibitor continued for up to 48 h. Significant decrease in TER between apical and basolateral compartments of MI-432-treated IPEC-J2 cell monolayers proved that matriptase is one of the key effectors in the maintenance of barrier integrity. Changes in staining pattern of matriptase and in localization of the junctional protein occludin were observed suggesting that inhibition of matriptase by MI-432 can also exert an effect on paracellular gate opening via modulation of tight junctional protein assembly. This study confirms that non-tumorigenic IPEC-J2 cells can be used as an appropriate small intestinal model for the in vitro characterization of matriptase-related effects on intestinal epithelium. These findings demonstrate indirectly that matriptase plays a pivotal role in the development of barrier integrity; thus matriptase dysfunction can facilitate the occurence of   syndrome observed in intestinal inflammatory diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29742432>IL-9 and Mast Cells Are Key Players of Candida albicans Commensalism and Pathogenesis in the .</a></h1><p>Candida albicans is implicated in intestinal diseases. Identifying host signatures that discriminate between the pathogenic versus commensal nature of this human commensal is clinically relevant. In the present study, we identify IL-9 and mast cells (MCs) as key players of Candida commensalism and pathogenicity. By inducing TGF-β in stromal MCs, IL-9 pivotally contributes to mucosal immune tolerance via the indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase enzyme. However, Candida-driven IL-9 and mucosal MCs also contribute to barrier function loss, dissemination, and inflammation in experimental   models and are upregulated in patients with celiac disease. Inflammatory dysbiosis occurs with IL-9 and MC deficiency, indicating that the activity of IL-9 and MCs may go beyond host immunity to include regulation of the microbiota.

Dysregulation of this protective barrier is a primary driver of inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's and ulcerative colitis) and also infant gastrointestinal infections. Previously, our lab reported that hyaluronan (HA) isolated from human milk induces the expression of the antimicrobial peptide β-defensin in vivo and protects against Salmonella Typhimurium infection of epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, we demonstrated that commercially available 35 kDa size HA induces the expression of β-defensin, upregulates the expression of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and attenuates murine Citrobacter rodentium infection in vivo. In this current study, we report that HA35 remains largely intact and biologically active during transit through the digestive tract where it directly induces β-defensin expression upon epithelial cell contact. We also demonstrate HA35 abrogation of murine Salmonella Typhimurium infection as well as downregulation of  tight junction protein claudin- expression. Taken together, we propose a dual role for HA in host innate immune defense at the epithelial cell surface, acting to induce antimicrobial peptide production and also block pathogen-induced  .

Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, and reactive nitrogen species, such as nitric oxide and peroxynitrite, play essential roles in normal brain capillary endothelial cell functioning; however, chronically elevated oxidative and nitrosative stress can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and damage to the blood-brain barrier. Activated microglia, redox control of which is mediated by nitric oxide synthases and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases, secrete neurotoxic molecules such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, prostaglandin, cyclooxygenase-, quinolinic acid, several chemokines (including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 [CXCL-1] and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α [MIP-1α]) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, which can exert a detrimental effect on blood-brain barrier integrity and function. Similarly, reactive astrocytes produce neurotoxic molecules such as prostaglandin E2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can cause a ' brain'.Chronic inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress is associated with the development of a ' '.

The intestinal permeability assessed by the challenge tests has often been related to the changes of tight junction proteins in the epithelium or circulating endotoxin levels. In patients with IBD, alcoholic liver disease, NASH, liver cirrhosis, PBC, obstructive jaundice, severe acute pancreatitis, and CHF, endotoxemia and proinflammatory cytokinemia have been found in addition to increased permeability. In the serum of patients with IBS and depression, antiflagellin antibodies and antilipid A antibodies were detected, respectively, together with increased permeability and proinflammatory cytokinemia. The site of infection, which is localized to the intestine in IBD and IBS, includes various extraintestinal organs in other diseases. The relation of  dysbiosis to intestinal barrier dysfunction has gradually been clarified.Although no direct cause-and-effect relationship has been confirmed, all clinical and experimental data suggest the importance of intestinal hyperpermeability in the inflammatory changes of various diseases. Increased intestinal permeability is a new target for disease prevention and therapy. Considering the close relationship of 'the  ' and  dysbiosis to the major diseases, we can conclude that meticulous dietetic and probiotic approaches to recover healthy microbiota have the potential to make a breakthrough in the management of these diseases tomorrow.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27623987>NMR-based urinary profiling of lactulose/mannitol ratio used to assess the altered intestinal permeability in acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients.</a></h1><p>The article presents a simplified NMR-based protocol for urinary profiling of lactulose/mannitol ratio (LMR) and demonstrates here its utility to assess increased intestinal permeability (IP) in patients with acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). ACLF is a serious clinical complication associated with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). The major risk factor in its development is increased IP (' '), which has been linked to disease progression and to infectious complications. However, IP has seldom been investigated in patients with ACLF, even though patients frequently report gastrointestinal disorders and associated complications. To this end, we first optimized the NMR-based targeted profiling of urinary metabolites (i.e. actulose, mannitol, and creatinine) and subsequently used this resulted protocol (a) first to evaluate the altered IP in ACLF patients and then (b) to explore its utility for monitoring the treatment response in these patients. The normal profiles were obtained for 7 age and sex matched healthy volunteers. The results revealed that the urinary LMR excretion was significantly higher in ACLF patients compared to normal controls (median ~0.7, range (0.12-.84), vs median ~0.11, range (0.02-0.28), p < 0.001) suggesting that the ACLF patients' exhibit altered IP. However, the LMR excretion in six clinically improved follow-up ACLF patients was comparable to normal controls indicating restored IP after the treatment. The protocol-as demonstrated here with ACLF-is equally applicable for evaluating IP or mucosal barrier function in other intestinal disorders with reasonable sensitivity and specificity, highlighting its general utility.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085297>Sodium butyrate ameliorates insulin resistance and renal failure in CKD rats by modulating intestinal permeability and mucin expression.</a></h1><p>The associated increase in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels and uremic toxins in chronic kidney disease (CKD) has shifted the way we focus on intestinal microbiota. This study shows that a disruption of the intestinal barrier in CKD promotes leakage of LPS from the , subsequently decreasing insulin sensitivity. Butyrate treatment improved the intestinal barrier function by increasing colonic mucin and tight junction (TJ) proteins. This modulation further ameliorated metabolic functions such as insulin intolerance and improved renal function.Renal failure was induced by 5/6th nephrectomy (Nx) in rats. A group of Nx and control rats received sodium butyrate in drinking water. The Nx groups were compared with sham-operated controls.The Nx rats had significant increases in serum creatinine, urea and proteinuria. These animals had impaired glucose and insulin tolerance and increased gluconeogenesis, which corresponded with decreased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. The Nx animals suffered significant loss of intestinal TJ proteins, colonic mucin and mucin  protein. This was associated with a significant increase in circulating LPS, suggesting a   phenomenon. 5'adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, known to modulate epithelial TJs and glucose metabolism, was significantly reduced in the intestine of the Nx group. Anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 10, anti-bacterial peptide and cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide were also lowered in the Nx cohort. Butyrate treatment increased AMPK phosphorylation, improved renal function and controlled hyperglycemia.Butyrate improves AMPK phosphorylation, increases GLP-1 secretion and promotes colonic mucin and TJ proteins, which strengthen the  wall. This decreases LPS leakage and inflammation. Taken together, butyrate improves metabolic parameters such as insulin resistance and markers of renal failure in CKD animals.© The Author(s) 2018.

Since an increased number of veterans complain of gastrointestinal (GI), neuroinflammatory and metabolic complications as they age and there are limited options for a cure, the present study was focused to assess the role of butyrate, a short chain fatty acid for attenuating GWI-associated GI and metabolic complications. Results in a GWI-mouse model of permethrin and pyridostigmine bromide (PB) exposure showed that oral butyrate restored  homeostasis and increased GPR109A receptor copies in the small intestine (SI). Claudin-, a protein shown to be upregulated in conditions of   was significantly decreased following butyrate administration. Butyrate decreased TLR4 and TLR5 expressions in the liver concomitant to a decrease in TLR4 activation. GW-chemical exposure showed no clinical signs of liver disease but a significant alteration of metabolic markers such as SREBP1c, PPAR-α, and PFK was evident. Liver markers for lipogenesis and carbohydrate metabolism that were significantly upregulated following GW chemical exposure were attenuated by butyrate priming in vivo and in human primary hepatocytes. Further, Glucose transporter Glut-4 that was shown to be elevated following liver complications were significantly decreased in these mice after butyrate administration. Finally, use of TLR4 KO mice completely attenuated the liver metabolic changes suggesting the central role of these receptors in the GWI pathology. In conclusion, we report a butyrate specific mechanistic approach to identify and treat increased metabolic abnormalities in GWI veterans with systemic inflammation, chronic fatigue, GI disturbances, metabolic complications and weight gain.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to investigate whether circulating markers of bacterial translocation were associated with survival in a Norwegian primary sclerosing cholangitis cohort.Serum levels of zonulin, intestinal fatty acid binding protein, soluble CD14, lipopolysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were measured in 166 primary sclerosing cholangitis patients and 100 healthy controls.Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and soluble CD14 were elevated in primary sclerosing cholangitis compared with healthy controls (median 13 662 vs 12 339 ng/mL, P = 0.010 and 1657 vs 1196 ng/mL, P < 0.001, respectively). High soluble CD14 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (values >optimal cut-off using receiver operating characteristics) were associated with reduced liver transplantation-free survival (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). The concentration of soluble CD14 was higher in patients with hepatobiliary cancer compared to other primary sclerosing cholangitis patients and healthy controls. Zonulin was lower in primary sclerosing cholangitis than controls, but when excluding primary sclerosing cholangitis patients with increased prothrombin time zonulin concentrations were similar in primary sclerosing cholangitis and healthy controls. Concomitant inflammatory bowel disease did not influence the results, while inflammatory bowel disease patients without primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 40) had lower concentration of soluble CD14. In multivariable Cox regression, high soluble CD14 and high lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were associated with transplantation-free survival, independent from Mayo risk score (HR: .26 [95% CI: 1.15-4.43], P = 0.018 and HR: .00 [95% CI: 1.17-3.43], P = 0.011, respectively).Primary sclerosing cholangitis patients show increased levels of circulating markers of bacterial translocation.

Serum concentrations of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, zonulin (a marker for  ), and high-mobility group box protein (HMGB1, a nuclear protein triggering inflammation) were measured. Correlations of serum levels of zonulin and HMGB1 with strength of plantar flexor muscles and number of steps taken per day were analyzed.Serum concentration of zonulin and HMGB1 were 22% (P = .005) and 16% (P = .010) higher in the older versus young adults. Serum zonulin was positively associated with concentrations of TNF-α (r = 0.357, P = .032) and IL-6 (r = 0.345, P = .043). Importantly, both zonulin and HMGB1 were negatively correlated with skeletal muscle strength (zonulin: r = -0.332, P = .048; HMGB1: r = -0.383, P = .023), and habitual physical activity (zonulin: r = -0.410, P = .016; HMGB1: r = -0.483, P = .004).Serum zonulin was associated with both systemic inflammation and  key indices of physical frailty.

Alterations in the relative numbers of  microbiota may contribute to such a disruption in normal bacterial diversity. It is assumed that this process may be adequately mirrored for the purpose of the current paper by modeling the dynamic shifts in the numbers of three bacterial species, namely Clostridium, Desulfovibrio, and Bifidobacterium.

Despite current treatments, the prevalence of asthma has increased markedly over decades. According to the theories proposed to explain the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases in integrative medicine,   syndrome is a phenomenon of increased intestinal permeability due to the disruption of tight junctions and is thought to be related to many chronic diseases, such as food intolerance, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and other autoimmune disease. One of the classical approaches used by integrative physicians to treat   syndrome is to repair intestinal permeability to prevent allergic cascade.

The aim of this study was to investigate the intestinal dysbiosis in T1D patients and correlate these results with clinical parameters and cytokines. The present study was approved by the Barretos Cancer Hospital (Process number 903/2014), and all participants have signed the informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and answered a questionnaire about dietary habits. Stool samples were used for bacterial 16S sequencing by MiSeq Illumina platform. IL-, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, TNF, and IFN-γ plasma concentrations were determined by cytometric bead arrays. The Pearson's chi-square, Mann-Whitney and Spearman correlation were used for statistical analyses. Alpha and beta diversities were conducted by using an annotated observed taxonomic units table. This study included 20 patients and 28 controls, and we found significant differences ( < 0.05) among consumption of vegetables, proteins, milk and derivatives, spicy food, and canned food when we compare patients and controls.

The inflammatory interleukin-6 was significantly increased ( = 0.017) in patients' plasma. Furthermore, we showed correlation among patients with poor glycemic control, represented by high levels of HbA1 percentages and Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillales, and  relative abundances.

A potential mechanism of action for antibiotic growth promoters and probiotics is alleviation or attenuation of such inflammation. In vivo inflammation models and markers to quantify changes in inflammation, such as paracellular leakage and tight junction function, are necessary tools in the search for methods to reduce enteric inflammation. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and feed restriction (FRS), and fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d; 3 to 5 kDa) marker were evaluated for induction and assessment of enteric inflammation in broilers. Three independent experiments were conducted where birds received an inflammation inducer treatment and an oral gavage of FITC-d (. mg/bird) .5 h before killing on d 4, followed by measurement of serum FITC-d levels and release of FITC-d from different regions of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) to evaluate tight junction function. Experiment 1 tested control (CON) and DSS; Experiments  and 3 evaluated CON, DSS, and FRS. In all experiments DSS, as well as FRS in Experiments  and 3, showed higher (P<0.05) leakage of FITC-d into serum than CON, but FRS was not different from DSS. The amount of FITC-d retained in duodenal and cecal tissue was affected (P<0.05) by FRS in Experiments  and 3, and DSS affected FITC-d retention in duodenum only, suggesting differences in  passage or absorption/adsorption. In conclusion, DSS oral gavage and FRS could induce  , with changes in serum FITC-d and migration of FITC-d from GIT.© 2015 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29939312>Intestinal barrier disruption and dysregulated mucosal immunity contribute to kidney fibrosis in chronic kidney disease.</a></h1><p>Emerging evidence suggests that intestinal dysbiosis is associated with diverse pathological processes. In this study we demonstrated intestinal barrier disruption and aberrant mucosal immunity in 5/6 nephrectomized mice and the effect of probiotics on chronic kidney disease (CKD).CKD was induced in 6-week-old mice by 5/6 nephrectomy.

Although the percentage of regulatory T cells did not differ between CKD and control mice, cytokine expression and the ratio of CX3CR1intermediate:CX3CR1high pro-inflammatory/resident macrophages increased in the colon of CKD mice. Orally administered lactobacilli partially mitigated the CKD-induced ' '; restored colon epithelial HSP70, claudin-1 and claudin- expression and decreased apoptosis. Probiotic treatment also restored the CX3CR1intermediate:CX3CR1high macrophage ratio and increased circular dichroism (CD)103+CD11c+ regulatory dendritic cells in the colon.

Intestinal permeability, the phenomenon most readily and commonly studied, reflects just one (albeit an important one) function of the barrier that is intimately related to and interacts with luminal contents, including the microbiota. The mucosal immune response also influences barrier integrity; effects of inflammation per se must be accounted for in the interpretation of permeability studies in disease states.Although several aspects of barrier function can be assessed in man, one must be aware of exactly what a given test measures, as well as of its limitations. The temptation to employ results from a test of paracellular flux to imply a role for barrier dysfunction in disorders thought to be based on bacterial or macromolecular translocation must be resisted. Although changes in barrier function have been described in several gastrointestinal disorders, their primacy remains to be defined. At present, few studies support efficacy for an intervention that improves barrier function in altering the natural history of a disease process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30597073>Reduced protein diet and amino acid concentration alter intestinal barrier function and performance of broiler chickens with or without synthetic glucocorticoid.</a></h1><p>Little is known about the effect of low-protein (LP) diets on intestinal barrier function and permeability. In the first part of this study, starting on day 9 of age, the growth performance of the birds fed 3 experimental diets in each phase of feeding (G/F: grower/finisher) was investigated. Three experimental diets were as follows: LP (170/150 g/kg CP) fortified with essential amino acids (EAA), standard protein (SP), (202/190 g/kg), and high protein (HP) (220/210 g/kg). LP and SP diets contained a similar level of EAA concentration, while the HP diet contained 10% above the Ross 308 specifications. Each diet was replicated 6 times (10 male birds per replicate). The second part investigated intestinal permeability (IP) and function on additional 72 birds. On days 14, 16, and 20, a total of 36 birds (12 birds per diet) were injected with dexamethasone (DEX) to induce  . Birds fed LP diets had lower body weight gain (BWG) and higher feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared with SP and HP diets in both grower and finisher phases of feeding. For the challenge part, DEX increased the FCR independent of diets. Diet and DEX interacted for BWG, whereby the effect of diets was only evident in sham-injected birds. Birds fed LP had a higher fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) concentration indicating a more permeable intestine compared to HP, but similar to SP. DEX increased FITC-d concentration in all dietary treatments. Birds fed LP had less ileal zonula occludens- (ZO-) expression in comparison with SP, but not HP. DEX increased the expression of Claudin3 and ZO- and reduced Claudin1 (P < 0.05) and junctional adhesion molecule  in the ileum. Expression of ileal Na+-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) was upregulated in LP fed group. It is concluded that compared with SP, IP can be maintained in LP by supplementing EAA. However, when compared with HP, feeding birds with LP may lead to a higher IP. DEX had a profound independent effect on intestinal barrier function.© 2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27939537>Short communication: Early-lactation, but not mid-lactation, bovine lactoferrin preparation increases epithelial barrier integrity of Caco- cell layers.</a></h1><p>Bovine lactoferrin is an important milk protein with many health-promoting properties, including improving intestinal barrier integrity. Dysfunction of this barrier, commonly referred to as " ," has been linked to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. With some processing techniques, lactoferrin isolated from milk collected at the start of the milking season (early lactation) may have lower purity than that isolated from milk collected during the rest of the milking season (mid-lactation) and could result in differences in bioactivity based on the stage of lactation. We compared reversed-phase HPLC chromatographs of early-lactation and mid-lactation preparations and found that both had large chromatograph peaks at the time predicted for lactoferrin. The notable difference between the  chromatographs was a much larger peak in the early-lactation lactoferrin sample that was determined to be angiogenin. Angiogenin was first identified due to its ability to induce new blood vessel formation, but is now known to be involved in numerous physiological processes. Then, we compared the effects of early-lactation and mid-lactation lactoferrin preparations in  bioassays: trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), a measure of intestinal barrier integrity, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine secretion, a measure of immune-stimulatory properties. We found that early-lactation lactoferrin increased TEER across Caco- cell layers compared with control from 10 to 48 h, mid-lactation lactoferrin did not alter TEER. We also found that early-lactation lactoferrin reduced the amount of IL-8 produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (compared with those treated with control medium) to a greater extent than mid-lactation lactoferrin. A pro-inflammatory chemokine, IL-8 is also known to decrease barrier function. These results suggest that the decrease in IL-8 production in the presence of early-lactation lactoferrin may be the mechanism by which it increases TEER. The anti-inflammatory effect of early-lactation lactoferrin may be related to the presence of angiogenin, which is known to suppress inflammatory responses. This work indicates that products rich in angiogenin may have intestinal health benefits, and further work to investigate this is warranted.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

The aim of this article is to present a new hypothesis connecting the inflammatory theory of depression with IgG food hypersensitivity and   syndrome. This new potential pathway that may mediate the pathogenesis of depression implies the existence of subsequent developmental stages. Overproduction of zonulin triggered, for example, by gliadin through activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and protease-activated receptor causes loosening of the tight junction barrier and an increase in permeability of the  wall (' '). This results in a process allowing larger molecules that would normally stay in the  to cross into the bloodstream and in the induction of IgG-dependent food sensitivity. This condition causes an increased immune response and consequently induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn may lead to the development of depressive symptoms. It seems advisable to assess the intestinal permeability using as a marker, for example, zonulin and specific IgG concentrations against selected nutritional components in patients with depression. In the case of increased IgG concentrations, the implementation of an elimination-rotation diet may prove to be an effective method of reducing inflammation. This new paradigm in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders linking  , IgG-dependent food sensitivity, inflammation, and depression is promising, but still needs further studies to confirm this theory.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28120842> permeability and mucosal inflammation: bad, good or context dependent.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial disease. A breach in the mucosal barrier, otherwise known as " ," is alleged to promote mucosal inflammation by intensifying immune activation. However, interaction between the luminal antigen and mucosal immune system is necessary to maintain mucosal homeostasis. Furthermore, manipulations leading to deregulated  permeability have resulted in susceptibility in mice to colitis as well as to creating adaptive immunity. These findings implicate a complex but dynamic association between mucosal permeability and immune homeostasis; however, they also emphasize that compromised  permeability alone may not be sufficient to induce colitis. Emerging evidence further supports the role(s) of proteins associated with the mucosal barrier in epithelial injury and repair: manipulations of associated proteins also modified epithelial differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Taken together, the role of  permeability and proteins associated in regulating mucosal inflammatory diseases appears to be more complex than previously thought. Herein, we review outcomes from recent mouse models where  permeability was altered by direct and indirect effects of manipulating mucosal barrier-associated proteins, to highlight the significance of mucosal permeability and the non-barrier-related roles of these proteins in regulating chronic mucosal inflammatory conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27114435>The Effect of DA-6034 on Intestinal Permeability in an Indomethacin-Induced Small Intestinal Injury Model.</a></h1><p>DA-6034 has anti-inflammatory activities and exhibits cytoprotective effects in acute gastric injury models.

Hemorrhagic lesions in the treatment group were broader than those in the control group, but the difference was statistically insignificant. Intestinal permeability was lower in the treatment group than in the control group.

Also, the levels of Zonulin were significantly lower in patients with LC compared to CH and normal controls (p<0.001).

The transmissibility of ethanol-induced liver disease has been demonstrated using faecal microbiota transfer in preclinical models. This technique has also led to improved survival in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, suggesting that changes in the composition and function of the  microbiota are causatively linked to alcohol-related liver disease. A major mechanism by which  microbiota influence the development of alcohol-related liver disease is through a  intestinal barrier. This permits translocation of viable bacteria and microbial products to the liver, where they induce and promote inflammation, as well as contribute to hepatocyte death and the fibrotic response. In addition,  dysbiosis is associated with changes in the metabolic function of the intestinal microbiota, bile acid composition and circulation, immune dysregulation during onset and progression of alcohol-related liver disease. Findings from preclinical and human studies will be used to demonstrate how alcohol causes intestinal pathology and contributes to alcohol-related liver disease and how the latter is self-perpetuating. Additionally, we summarise the effects of untargeted treatment approaches on the  microbiota, such as diet, probiotics, antibiotics and faecal microbial transplantation in alcohol-related liver disease. We further discuss how targeted approaches can restore intestinal homeostasis and improve alcohol-related liver disease. These approaches are likely to add to the therapeutic options for alcohol-related liver disease independently or in conjunction with steroids.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30347427>  biomarkers in depression and suicidal behavior.</a></h1><p>Inflammation is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicidal behavior. According to the '  hypothesis', increased intestinal permeability may contribute to this relationship via bacterial translocation across enterocytes. We measured plasma levels of  permeability markers, in patients with a recent suicide attempt (rSA), MDD subjects with no history of a suicide attempt (nsMDD), and healthy controls (HC), and related these markers to symptom severity and inflammation.We enrolled rSA (n = 54), nsMDD (n = 13), and HC (n = 17). Zonulin, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), soluble CD14, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were quantified in plasma. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Suicide Assessment Scale (SUAS) were used for symptom assessments.The rSA group displayed higher I-FABP and lower zonulin levels compared with both the nsMDD and the HC groups (all P < 0.001). IL-6 correlated positively with I-FABP (r = 0.24, P < 0.05) and negatively with zonulin (r = -0.25, P < 0.05). In all subjects, I-FABP levels correlated positively with MADRS (r = 0.25, P < 0.05) and SUAS scores (r = 0.38, P < 0.001), and the latter correlation was significant also in the nsMDD group (r = 0.60, P < 0.05).The '  hypothesis' may improve our understanding of the link between inflammation and suicidal behavior. These findings should be considered preliminary until replicated in larger cohorts.© 2018 The Authors.

The transmembrane protein claudin  (CLDN2) is a component of epithelial tight junctions (TJs). In the intestines of patients with IBDs, the expression of the pore-forming TJ protein CLDN2 is upregulated. Although CLDN2 is involved in these  barriers, whether it can be a target to enhance TJ integrity is unknown because a CLDN2-specific inhibitor has not been developed. Here, we used DNA immunization to generate a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognized an extracellular loop of CLDN2. Treatment of epithelial cell monolayers with the mAb increased barrier integrity. In addition, the anti-CLDN2 mAb attenuated the decrease in TJ integrity induced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), and cotreatment of cells with anti-TNF- mAb and anti-CLDN2 mAb showed additive attenuating effects. These findings indicate that CLDN2 may be a target for enhancing TJ integrity, and CLDN2 binder may be an enhancer of mucosal barrier integrity and a potential therapeutic option for IBDs.Copyright © 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p></html>
