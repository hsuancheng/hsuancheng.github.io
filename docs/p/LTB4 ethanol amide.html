Under light anaesthesia with ether, male rats were subjected to intracolonic administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNB) in 50%  and were then sacrificed 2, 4 and 7 days after colitis induction. Untreated rats exhibited elevated colonic levels of  () and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and an increase in colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (investigated as an index of leukocyte adhesion and accumulation). Moreover, ulceration and  of the distal colon with formation of granuloma and pathologic connections were observed. Treated rats received zileuton or sulphasalazine (50 mg/kg per os twice a day) 24 h before the induction of colitis until they were sacrificed. Treatment with the specific 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, zileuton, resulted in significant reductions of colonic  and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha synthesis, macroscopic and histological colonic damage and colonic  as assessed by the measurement of MPO activity. In contrast, sulphasalazine had a lower effect than zileuton on  and MPO levels (p < 0.05), while it was able to reduce colonic damage and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels as well as zileuton. This study shows, therefore, that zileuton is effective in attenuating the lesions in an experimental model of colitis. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that leukotrienes play an important role in the pathogenesis of intestinal bowel diseases (IBD).</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3146394>Failure of the inhibition of rat gastric mucosal 5-lipoxygenase by novel acetohydroxamic acids to prevent -induced damage.</a></h2><p>1. The role of  () and LTC4 as mediators of gastric mucosal damage following  challenge in vivo has been investigated using two selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, BW A4C and BW A137C. 2. Oral administration of  to rats in vivo, induced macroscopic damage to the gastric mucosa and markedly increased the formation of the 5-lipoxygenase products,  and LTC4, from the mucosa ex vivo. 3. Pretreatment with the acetohydroxamic acids BW A4C and BW A137C (5-50 mg kg-1 p.o.) dose-dependently reduced -stimulated  and LTC4 formation by the gastric mucosa, with an ID50 of approximately 5 mg kg-1 p.o. 4. A single oral dose of BW A4C (20 mg kg-1) induced near-maximal inhibition of mucosal  formation within 30 min, which was well maintained for 5 h, whereas BW A137C (20 mg kg-1 p.o.) induced maximal inhibition between 30 and 60 min after administration, which then diminished over the subsequent 5 h. 5. The mucosal formation of the cyclo-oxygenase product, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, which was unaltered following  challenge, was not inhibited by the acetohydroxamic acids. Likewise, the small increase in mucosal thromboxane B2 formation following challenge was not inhibited by BW A4C. 6. Neither BW A4C nor BW A137C, at doses that almost completely inhibited the mucosal synthesis of  or LTC4, reduced the macroscopic gastric mucosal damage induced by . 7. Pretreatment with the lipoxygenase inhibitor BW 755C (5-50 mg kg-1 p.o.) did reduce mucosal damage, but there was a dissociation between the degree of protection and the inhibition of  biosynthesis. 8. Oral administration of high doses of either BW A4C or BW A137C (300mgkg-1) did not induce macroscopic gastric damage over a 3 h period. 9. These findings suggest that the leukotrienes,  and LTC4 are not the primary mediators of -induced acute mucosal damage, but do not exclude their role in more chronic gastric damage and .</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p></html>
