Although selectins and integrins mediate recruitment in many tissues, they have a minimal role in the lungs and liver. Exploiting an unbiased in vivo functional screen, we identified a lung and liver homing peptide that functionally abrogates neutrophil recruitment to these organs. Using biochemical, genetic, and confocal intravital imaging approaches, we identified dipeptidase-1 (DPEP1) as the target and established its role as a physical adhesion receptor for neutrophil sequestration independent of its enzymatic activity. Importantly, genetic ablation or functional peptide blocking of DPEP1 significantly reduced neutrophil recruitment to the lungs and liver and provided improved survival in models of . Our data establish DPEP1 as a major adhesion receptor on the lung and liver endothelium and identify a therapeutic target for neutrophil-driven inflammatory diseases of the lungs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated modulation of PMN-endothelial cell adhesive interactions by water-soluble CORM-401 using an experimental model of  in vitro. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) grown on laminar-flow perfusion channels were stimulated with 1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide for 6 hours and perfused with 100 μmol/L CORM-401 (or inactive compound iCORM-401)-pretreated PMN for  minutes in the presence of 1.0 dyn/cm shear stress.PMN co-cultures were perfused for additional 15 minutes with PMN-free medium containing CORM-401/inactive CORM-401. The experiments were videorecorded (phase-contrast microscopy), and PMN adhesion/migration were assessed off-line. In parallel, CORM-401-dependent modulation of PMN chemotaxis, F-actin expression/distribution, and actin-regulating pathways [eg, p21-activated protein kinases (PAK1/2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)] were assessed in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) stimulation. Pretreating PMN with CORM-401 did not suppress PMN adhesion to HUVEC, but significantly reduced PMN transendothelial migration (P < 0.0001) and fMLP-induced PMN chemotaxis (ie, migration directionality and velocity). These changes were associated with CORM-401-dependent suppression of F-actin levels/cellular distribution and fMLP-induced phosphorylation of PAK1/2 and ERK/JNK MAPK (P < 0.05). CORM-401 had no effect on p38 MAPK activation. In summary, this study demonstrates, for the first time, CORM-401-dependent suppression of neutrophil migratory potential associated with modulation of PAK1/2 and ERK/JNK MAPK signaling and F-actin dynamics.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

We hypothesized that the PPAR-β/δ-agonist GW0742 improves long-term outcome after sepsis caused by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Fifty-one CD-1 female mice underwent CLP and received either vehicle (control), GW0742 (0.03 mg/kg/injection; five post-CLP i.v. injections), GSK0660 (PPAR-β/δ-antagonist) or both and were monitored for 28 d. Another 20 CLP mice treated with GW0742 and vehicle were sacrificed 24 h post-CLP to assess coagulopathy. Compared to vehicle, survival of CLP-mice treated with GW0742 was higher by 35% at d 7 and by 50% at d 28. CLP mice treated with GW0742 had 60% higher IFN-γ but circulating monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and chemokine ligand were lower at 48 h post-CLP. Compared to vehicle, CLP mice treated with GW0742 exhibited a 50% reduction in the circulating plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 associated with an increase in platelet number at 24 h post-CLP (but no changes occurred in anti-thrombin-III, plasminogen, fibrinogen and clotting-times). CLP mice treated with GW0742 exhibited a similar increase in most of the biochemical markers of organ injury/dysfunction (lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and triglycerides) measured. Treatment with GW0742 consistently improved long-term survival in septic CD-1 mice by partially modulating the post-CLP systemic cytokine response and coagulation systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28400412>Western-diet consumption induces alteration of barrier function mechanisms in the ileum that correlates with metabolic  in rats.</a></h1><p>Obesity and its related disorders have been associated with the presence in the blood of gut bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS). However, the factors underlying this low-grade elevation in plasma LPS, so-called metabolic , are not fully elucidated. We aimed to investigate the effects of Western diet (WD) feeding on intestinal and hepatic LPS handling mechanisms in a rat model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). Rats were fed either a standard chow diet (C) or a Western Diet (WD, 45% fat) for 6 wk. They were either fed ad libitum or pair-fed to match the caloric intake of C rats for the first week, then fed ad libitum for the remaining  wk. Six-week WD feeding led to a mild obese phenotype with increased adiposity and elevated serum LPS-binding protein (LBP) levels relative to C rats, irrespective of initial energy intake. Serum LPS was not different between dietary groups but exhibited strong variability. Disrupted ileal mucus secretion and decreased ileal Reg3-γ and -β gene expression along with high ileal permeability to LPS were observed in WD compared with C-fed rats. Ileal and cecal intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) activity as well as Verrucomicrobia and Bifidobacterium cecal levels were increased in WD-fed rats compared with C-fed rats. WD consumption did not impact mRNA levels of LPS-handling hepatic enzymes. Correlation analysis revealed that ileal passage of LPS, IAP activity, Proteobacteria levels and hepatic  gene expression correlated with serum LPS and LBP, suggesting that ileal mucosal defense impairment induced by WD feeding contribute to metabolic .Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29348256>Flavonoids, Dairy Foods, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic Health: A Review of Emerging Biologic Pathways.</a></h1><p>A growing body of nutritional science highlights the complex mechanisms and pleiotropic pathways of cardiometabolic effects of different foods. Among these, some of the most exciting advances are occurring in the area of flavonoids, bioactive phytochemicals found in plant foods; and in the area of dairy, including milk, yogurt, and cheese. Many of the relevant ingredients and mechanistic pathways are now being clarified, shedding new light on both the ingredients and the pathways for how diet influences health and well-being. Flavonoids, for example, have effects on skeletal muscle, adipocytes, liver, and pancreas, and myocardial, renal, and immune cells, for instance, related to '-monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, endothelial NO synthase activation, and suppression of NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB) and TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4). Effects of dairy are similarly complex and may be mediated by specific amino acids, medium-chain and odd-chain saturated fats, unsaturated fats, branched-chain fats, natural  fats, probiotics, vitamin K1/K2, and calcium, as well as by processing such as fermentation and homogenization. These characteristics of dairy foods influence diverse pathways including related to mammalian target of rapamycin, silent information regulator transcript-1, angiotensin-converting enzyme, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, osteocalcin, matrix glutamate protein, hepatic de novo lipogenesis, hepatic and adipose fatty acid oxidation and inflammation, and gut microbiome interactions such as intestinal integrity and . The complexity of these emerging pathways and corresponding biological responses highlights the rapid advances in nutritional science and the continued need to generate robust empirical evidence on the mechanistic and clinical effects of specific foods.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28531802>Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect of cerium dioxide nanoparticles immobilized on the surface of silica nanoparticles in rat experimental pneumonia.</a></h1><p>A massage with the potent counter-inflammatory material, cerium dioxide nanoparticles, is promising and the antioxidant properties of CeO are considered the main, if not the only, mechanism of this action. Nevertheless, the elimination of ceria nano-particles from the organism is very slow and there is a strong concern for toxic effect of ceria due to its accumulation. To overcome this problem, we engineered a combined material in which cerium nanoparticles were immobilized on the surface of silica nanoparticles (CeO NP), which is shown to be easily removed from an organism and could be used as carriers for nano-ceria. In our study particle size was 220±5nm, Zeta-potential -4.5mV (in water), surface charge density -17.22μC/cm (at pH 7). Thirty-six male Wistar rats,  months old and 250-290g were divided into four groups: 1) control; 2) CeO NP treatment; 3) experimental pneumonia (i/p LPS injection, 1mg/kg); and 4) experimental pneumonia treated with CeO NP (4 times during the study in dosage of 0.6mg/kg with an orogastric catheter). Gas exchange and pulmonary ventilation were measured four times: 0, 1, 3 and 24h after LPS injection in both untreated and CeO NP-treated animals. The mRNA of TNF-α, Il-6, and CxCL2 were determined by RT-PCR. ROS-generation in blood plasma and lung tissue homogenates were measured by means of lucigenin- and luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence.  in the acute phase was associated with: (1) pathological changes in lung morphology; (2) increase of ROS generation; (3) enhanced expression of CxCL2; and (4) a gradual decrease of VO and V. CeO2 NP treatment of intact animals did not make any changes in all studied parameters except for a significant augmentation of VO and V CeO NP treatment of rats with pneumonia created positive changes in diminishing lung tissue injury, decreasing ROS generation in blood and lung tissue and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-α, Il-6 and CxCL2). Oxygen consumption in this group was increased compared to the LPS pneumonia group. In our study we have shown anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of CeO NP. In addition, this paper is the first to report that CeO NP stimulates oxygen consumption in both healthy rats, and rats with pneumonia. We propose the key in understanding the mechanisms behind the phenomena lies in the property of CeO NP to scavenge ROS and the influence of this potent antioxidant on mitochondrial function. The study of biodistribution and elimination of СеОNP is the purpose of our ongoing study.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

SD rats were randomly divided into five groups: control group, LPS group (15 mg kg), LPS plus dexamethasone (2 mg kg), and LPS plus Sal groups with different Sal doses (20 mg kg, 40 mg kg). Wet-to-dry weight (W/D) ratio was performed. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of lung was performed. Lung level of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was measured. Serum levels of the activities of the anti-oxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), glutathione (GSH), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were measured. Caveolin-1 and TLR/NF-κB pathway proteins were detected by Western blot. In vitro, we evaluated the protective effect of Sal on A549 cell line induced by LPS. The activities of the antioxidant SOD, CAT, GSH and GPX, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in cellular supernatant were measured. Caveolin-1 and TLR/NF-κB pathway was examined by Western blot. As a result, Sal significantly attenuated the above indices. In addition, Sal exerts pronounced protective effects in rats subjected to LPS possibly through inhibiting the caveolin-1 and TLR/NF-κB pathway in vivo. Our results indicated that Sal could be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of lung injury disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31247270>Brainstem cholinergic pathways diminish cardiovascular and neuroinflammatory actions of  in rats: Role of NFκB/α7/α4β2AChRs signaling.</a></h1><p>Nicotine improves endotoxic manifestations of hypotension and cardiac autonomic dysfunction in rats. Here, we test the hypothesis that brainstem antiinflammatory pathways of α7/α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) modulate endotoxic cardiovascular derangements. Pharmacologic and molecular studies were performed to determine the influence of nicotine or selective α7/α4β2-nAChR ligands on cardiovascular derangements and brainstem neuroinflammation caused by  in conscious rats. The i.v. administration of nicotine (50 μg/kg) abolished the lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg i.v.)-evoked: (i) falls in blood pressure and spectral measure of cardiac sympathovagal balance (ratio of the low-frequency to high-frequency power, LF/HF), (ii) elevations in immunohistochemical protein expressions of NFκB and α4β2-nAChR in medullary neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), and (iii) decreases in medullary α7-nAChR protein expression. These favorable nicotine influences were replicated in rats treated intracisternally (i.c.) with PHA-543613 (selective α7-nAChR agonist) or -iodo-A-85380 (5IA, selective α4β2-nAChRs agonist). Measurement of arterial baroreflex activity by the vasoactive method revealed that nicotine, PHA, or 5IA reversed the LPS depression of reflex bradycardic, but not tachycardic, activity. Moreover, the counteraction by nicotine of LPS hypotension was mostly inhibited after treatment with i.c. methyllycaconitine (MLA, α7-nAChR antagonist) in contrast to a smaller effect for dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHβE, α4β2-nAChR antagonist), whereas the associated increases in LF/HF ratio remained unaltered.

Activators of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been reported to activate MEF2, but a comprehensive analysis of GPCR activators that regulate MEF2 has to our knowledge not been performed. Here, we tested several GPCR agonists regarding their ability to activate a MEF2 reporter in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E (PGE) strongly activated MEF2. Using pharmacological and protein-based inhibitors, we demonstrated that PGE regulates MEF2 via the EP receptor, the βγ subunit of G protein and two concomitantly activated downstream pathways. The first consists of Tiam1, Rac1, and its effector p21-activated kinase 2, the second of protein kinase D. Both pathways converge on and inactivate histone deacetylase  (HDAC5) and thereby de-repress MEF2. ,  in MEF2-reporter mice induced upregulation of PGE and MEF2 activation. Our findings provide an unexpected new link between inflammation and cardiac remodeling by de-repression of MEF2 through HDAC5 inactivation, which has potential implications for new strategies to treat inflammatory cardiomyopathies.© 2018 The Authors.

However, the mechanisms leading to HMGB1 release in inflammatory conditions and the therapeutic agents that could prevent it remain poorly understood. This study attempted to examine whether the  herb, which is known to have anti-inflammatory property, can modulate cellular inflammatory responses by regulating HMGB1 release.The murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or a  extract-loaded nanoemulsion (CLEN). The levels of released HMGB1, nitric oxide (NO) production, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression, and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases were analyzed in RAW264.7 macrophages. The effects of CLEN on survival of endotoxemic model mice, circulating HMGB1 levels, and tissue iNOS expression were also evaluated.We have shown that a nanoemulsion loaded with an extract from the  rhizome regulates cellular inflammatory responses and LPS-induced systemic inflammation by suppressing the release of HMGB1 by macrophages. First, treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages with the nanoemulsion significantly attenuated their LPS-induced release of HMGB1: this effect was mediated by inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, which in turn suppressed the NO production and iNOS expression of the cells. The nanoemulsion did not affect LPS-induced p38 or extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Second, intraperitoneal administration of the nanoemulsion improved the survival rate of LPS-injected endotoxemic mice. This associated with marked reductions in circulating HMGB1 levels and tissue iNOS expression.The present study shows for the first time the mechanism by which  ameliorates sepsis, namely, by suppressing NO signaling and thereby inhibiting the release of the proinflammatory cytokine HMGB1. These observations suggest that identification of agents, including those in the herb , that can inhibit HMGB1 production and/or activity may aid the treatment of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28942644>An Endocannabinoid Uptake Inhibitor from Black Pepper Exerts Pronounced Anti-Inflammatory Effects in Mice.</a></h1><p>Guineensine is a dietary N-isobutylamide widely present in black and long pepper (Piper nigrum and Piper longum) previously shown to inhibit cellular endocannabinoid uptake. Given the role of endocannabinoids in inflammation and pain reduction, here we evaluated guineensine in mouse models of acute and inflammatory pain and . Significant dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effects (95.6 ± 3.1% inhibition of inflammatory pain at 2. mg/kg ip and 50.0 ± 15.9% inhibition of edema formation at  mg/kg ip) and acute analgesia (66.1 ± 28.1% inhibition at .0 mg/kg ip) were observed. Moreover, guineensine inhibited proinflammatory cytokine production in . Intriguingly, guineensine and LPS independently induced catalepsy, but in combination this effect was abolished. Both hypothermia and analgesia were blocked by the CB1 receptor inverse agonist rimonabant, but the pronounced hypolocomotion was CB1 receptor-independent. A subsequent screen of 45 CNS-related receptors, ion channels, and transporters revealed apparent interactions of guineensine with the dopamine transporter DAT, 5HT2A, and sigma receptors, uncovering its prospective polypharmacology.

Once infected by virus or bacteria, patients can die due to systemic inflammation within a short period of time. Cytokine storm plays an essential role in causing organ dysfunction and septic shock. Thus, inhibition of cytokine secretion is considered very important in sepsis therapy. In this study, we found that TFP, an antipsychotic drug mainly used to treat schizophrenia by suppressing dopamine secretion, inhibited cytokine release from activated immune cells both in vitro and in vivo. Trifluoperazine (TFP) decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines without altering their transcription level. In LPS-induced  and cecal content injection (CCI) models, TFP intraperitoneal administration improved survival rate. Thus, TFP was considered to inhibit the secretion of proteins through a mechanism similar to that of W7, a calmodulin inhibitor. Finally, we confirmed that TFP treatment relieved organ damage by estimating the concentrations of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the serum. Our findings were regarded as a new discovery of the function of TFP in treating sepsis patients. KEY MESSAGES: • TFP inhibits LPS-induced activation of DCs by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine. • Treatment of TFP increases survival of LPS-induced  and CCI sepsis models. • TFP exerted a protective effect against tissue or organ damage in animal models.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588712>Lipopolysaccharide-based  produce toxicity in peripheral organs and microglia migration in a dose-dependent manner in rat substantia nigra.</a></h1><p>The peripheral inflammatory stimulus could induce cell damage in peripheral organs and activate microglial cells in the brain. One such stimulus was given to adult male Wistar rats by injecting different concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 50, 300, 500 g/kg and  mg/kg i.p.). To verify the systemic effect of the LPS administration, the serum content of C-reactive protein (CRP), the variation of body weight and cellular changes in the spleen, liver and kidney were determined. Motor impairment was evaluated by rotarod and open field tests. Microglia activation and dopaminergic degeneration was confirmed by immunolabelling for CD11b/c (microglia) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), respectively. The cell counting was performed in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), microglial activation was explored in SNpc, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr), substantia nigra pars compacta dorsal (SNcd) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). For the statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test (p ≤ 0.05) was used. On day 7 post intraperitoneal administration of LPS, cellular atrophy was detected in the liver, kidney and spleen at  mg/kg, without significant changes in CRP levels. Body weight loss and motor impairment was present only on day 1 post LPS administration. The dosage of 500 g/kg and  mg/kg of LPS caused the loss of dopaminergic neurons (40%) in SNpc and microglia migration in a dose-dependent manner in SNcd, SNpc and SNpr.

Recent studies have reported that gut dysbiosis and leakage of bacterial components, may contribute to the metabolic disturbances and systemic inflammation observed in subjects with MetS. Chronic exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been shown to induce features of MetS in experimental studies. LPS interacts with the innate immune system, facilitated through LPS-binding protein (LBP) and the co-receptor CD14, both regarded as markers of gut leakage.We investigated whether circulating levels of LBP and sCD14 are associated with the presence of MetS and its components, and further any association with systemic inflammation.We examined 482 men, aged between 65 and 75 years, all at high CVD risk. MetS criteria's according to the US National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III were met in 182 subjects (38%).Levels of LBP and sCD14 did not differ between individuals with and without MetS. However, a trend towards increased risk of MetS through quartiles of LBP was observed (p = 0.05). Individuals in the highest quartile (Q4), had an increased risk of MetS (OR = 1.76, 95% CI (1.04-3.00), compared to the lowest quartile (Q1) (p = 0.04). With regard to the separate constituents of MetS, patients who met the waist circumference criterion had significant higher concentration of LBP compared to those who did not (p = 0.04). We also found a weak, but significant correlation between LBP and waist circumference (r = 0.10, p = 0.03). Moderate, yet significant correlations were observed between both LBP and sCD14 and several markers of systemic inflammation (r = 0.1-0.23; p < 0.001-0.04).The trend for increased prevalence of MetS observed with increasing quartiles of LBP seems to be mainly driven by central obesity in our male cohort.

Cardiovascular complications greatly increase sepsis-associated mortality. Although murine models are routinely used for preclinical studies, the benefit of using genetically engineered mice in sepsis is countered by discrepancies between human and mouse sepsis pathophysiology. Therefore, recent guidelines have called for standardization of preclinical methods to document organ dysfunction. We investigated the course of cardiac dysfunction and myocardial load in different mouse models of sepsis to identify the optimal measurements for early systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Methods and Results We performed speckle-tracking echocardiography and assessed blood pressure, plasma inflammatory cytokines, lactate, B-type natriuretic peptide, and survival in mouse models of  or polymicrobial infection (cecal ligation and puncture, [ CLP ]) of moderate and high severity. We observed that myocardial strain and cardiac output were consistently impaired early in both sepsis models. Suppression of cardiac output was associated with systolic dysfunction in  or combined systolic dysfunction and reduced preload in the CLP model. We found that cardiac output at 2 hours post- CLP is a negative prognostic indicator with high sensitivity and specificity that predicts mortality at 48 hours. Using a known antibiotic (ertapenem) treatment, we confirmed that this approach can document recovery. Conclusions We propose a non-invasive approach for assessment of cardiac function in sepsis and myocardial strain and strain rate as preferable measures for monitoring cardiovascular function in sepsis mouse models. We further show that the magnitude of cardiac output suppression 2 hours post- CLP can be used to predict mortality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29179781>Low-fat yogurt consumption reduces biomarkers of chronic inflammation and inhibits markers of endotoxin exposure in healthy premenopausal women: a randomised controlled trial.</a></h1><p>The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of low-fat dairy product consumption are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine whether low-fat yogurt reduces biomarkers of chronic inflammation and endotoxin exposure in women. Premenopausal women (BMI 18·-27 and 30-40 kg/m2) were randomised to consume 339 g of low-fat yogurt (yogurt non-obese (YN); yogurt obese (YO)) or 324 g of soya pudding (control non-obese; control obese (CO)) daily for 9 weeks (n 30/group). Fasting blood samples were analysed for IL-6, TNF-α/soluble TNF II (sTNF-RII), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, anandamide, monocyte gene expression, soluble CD14 (sCD14), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS binding protein (LBP), IgM endotoxin-core antibody (IgM EndoCAb), and zonulin. BMI, waist circumference and blood pressure were also determined. After 9-week yogurt consumption, YO and YN had decreased TNF-α/sTNFR-RII. Yogurt consumption increased plasma IgM EndoCAb regardless of obesity status. sCD14 was not affected by diet, but LBP/sCD14 was lowered by yogurt consumption in both YN and YO. Yogurt intervention increased plasma 2-arachidonoylglycerol in YO but not YN. YO peripheral blood mononuclear cells expression of NF-κB inhibitor α and transforming growth factor β1 increased relative to CO at 9 weeks. Other biomarkers were unchanged by diet.

Feeding the HFD for  weeks resulted in liver steatosis and insulin resistance but not obesity. These changes were associated with increased production of short-chain fatty acids and increased Bacteroidetes in feces, with an augmented Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, among other changes in the microbiota. In addition, barrier function was weakened, with increased LPS plasma levels. These data are consistent with increased fructose availability in the distal gut due to saturation of absorptive mechanisms, leading to dysbiosis, , hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. Treatment with the synbiotic prevented some of the pathological effects, so that treated rats did not develop steatosis or systemic inflammation, while dysbiosis and barrier function were greatly ameliorated. In addition, the synbiotic had hypolipidemic effects. The synbiotic composed by L. fermentum CECT5716 and fructooligosaccharides has beneficial effects in a model of metabolic syndrome induced by a HFD, suggesting it might be clinically useful in this type of condition, particularly considering that high fructose intake has been related to metabolic syndrome in humans.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Only vasopressin exerted effects on PCA parameters compared to placebo, by mitigating the LPS-induced decrease in diastolic blood pressure by stabilizing SVR and cardiac output. The -induced decreased indices of microvascular flow and density were not influenced by vasopressor therapy.In a highly controlled model of systemic inflammation in humans in vivo, a five-hour infusion of various vasopressors revealed distinctive effects on macrohemodynamic variables without affecting the sublingual microcirculation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29630520>Phytochemical and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous leaf extract of Indian borage (oregano) on rats induced with inflammation.</a></h1><p>The Indian borage (Plectranthus amboinicus) also called Oregano contains many effective antioxidants, which includes caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid and flavonoids.

Anti-inflammatory properties of Plectranthus amboinicus grown within this environment have not been adequately explored.The protective and therapeutic effects of Oregano against  and inflammation were evaluated using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat models.A total of 30 Wistar rats were randomly selected for this study and divided into six groups, with each group having  rats. Inflammation was induced on appropriate animal groups using LPS injection at a concentration of 4 mg/kg. Aqueous leaf extract of Indian borage was administered orally in four doses (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg post-LPS exposure and 150 mg/kg pre-LPS exposure) to respective treatment rat groups. Haematological profile, toxicity profile of liver and kidney and levels of biomarkers of inflammation were assayed using standard methods.Rats injected with LPS showed severe anaemia and marked leucopoenia with significant decrease in monocytes compared to the control group (p< 0.05). There was increased expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (p< 0.05) in the peripheral circulation of rats exposed to LPS. Treatment with Indian borage significantly (p< 0.05) reduced the toxic effects in the LPS-treated animals and attenuated the increase in the expression of circulating proinflammatory cytokines; tumor necrosis factor alpha (TN-Fα) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) caused by LPS. Indian borage pretreatment also significantly (p< 0.05) counteracted the associated haematological dyscrasias caused by exposure to LPS. The extract elicited a significant protective effect on the kidney and liver as evidenced by the decreased renal markers and hepatic enzyme activities when compared with the control. The extract demonstrated protective and suppressive role against the overexpression of inflammatory mediators by ameliorating the induced inflammation and endotoxaemic conditions in the affected rat groups thereby validating its folkloric use.Our study thus reveals that the extract might be an active, natural and non-toxic drug lead against -induced inflammation and toxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30962268>B-cell dynamics during experimental  in humans.</a></h1><p>Recently, B cells with regulatory functions suppressing T-cell immunity were identified.

The oral cavity could be an additional source of inflammation. We aimed to determine the effect of periodontal therapy in cirrhosis through evaluating , inflammation, cognition, and quality of life (QOL). Age-matched cirrhotic and noncirrhotic subjects exhibiting chronic gingivitis and/or mild or moderate periodontitis underwent periodontal therapy with follow-up at 30 days. Saliva/stool for microbial composition and serum for Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, endotoxin and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and immune-inflammatory markers (IL-1β; IL-6; histatins 1, 3, ; and lysozyme) were collected at baseline and day 30. The cognitive function and QOL were also evaluated similarly. A separate group of cirrhotic patients were followed for the same duration without periodontal therapy. Cirrhotics, especially those with hepatic encephalopathy (HE), demonstrated improved dysbiosis in stool and saliva, and improved endotoxin, LBP, and salivary and serum inflammatory mediators following periodontal therapy. These parameters, which were higher in HE at baseline, became statistically similar posttherapy. Pretherapy vs. posttherapy QOL and cognition also improved in HE patients following oral interventions. On the other hand, LBP and endotoxin increased over time in cirrhotic patients not receiving therapy, but the rest of the parameters, including microbiota remained similar over time in the no-therapy group. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that periodontal therapy in cirrhosis, especially in those with HE, is associated with improved oral and gut dysbiosis, systemic inflammation, MELD score, and cognitive function, which was not observed in those who did not receive therapy over the same time period. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Systematic periodontal therapy in cirrhotic outpatients improved , as well as systemic and local inflammation, and modulated salivary and stool microbial dysbiosis over 30 days. This was associated with improved quality of life and cognition in patients with prior hepatic encephalopathy. In a cirrhotic group that was not provided periodontal therapy, there was an increase in endotoxin and lipopolysaccharide binding protein in the same duration.

However, it remains unclear whether the proinflammatory process precedes insulin resistance or it appears because of the development of obesity. Hypothalamic low-grade inflammation was induced by prolonged lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure to investigate if central insulin resistance is induced by an inflammatory stimulus regardless of obesity. Male Wistar rats were treated with single (1 LPS) or repeated injections (6 LPS) of LPS (100 μg/kg, IP) to evaluate the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), Protein kinase B (AKT), and JNK in the hypothalamus. Single LPS increased the expression of pIRS1, pAKT, and pJNK, whereas the repeated LPS treatment failed to recruit pIRS1 and pAKT. The 6 LPS treated rats showed increased total JNK and pJNK. The 6 LPS rats became unresponsive to the hypophagic effect induced by central insulin administration (12 μM/ μL, ICV). Prolonged exposure to LPS (24 h) impaired the insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation and the translocation of the transcription factor forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of the cultured hypothalamic GT1-7 cells. Central administration of the JNK inhibitor (20 μM/ μL, ICV) restored the ability of insulin to phosphorylate IRS1 and AKT in 6 LPS rats. The present data suggest that an increased JNK activity in the hypothalamus underlies the development of insulin resistance during prolonged exposure to endotoxins. Our study reveals that weight gain is not mandatory for the development of hypothalamic insulin resistance and the blockade of proinflammatory pathways could be useful for restoring the insulin signaling during prolonged low-grade inflammation as seen in obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28447763>Berberine protects against diet-induced obesity through regulating metabolic  and gut hormone levels.</a></h1><p>Systemic inflammation, which can be induced by metabolic , and corresponding high‑fat diet‑mediated metabolic disorders are associated with gut microbiota. In the present study reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, pyrosequencing, ELISA and Oil Red O staining were performed to assess whether berberine can protect against diet-induced obesity, through modulating the gut microbiota and consequently improving metabolic  and gastrointestinal hormone levels. Alterations in the gut microbiota induced by berberine resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial lipopolysaccharide levels in portal plasma. Levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, as well as the mRNA expression levels of macrophage infiltration markers in visceral adipose tissue, were also reduced by berberine. Inhibition of the inflammatory response was associated with a reduction in intestinal permeability and an increase in the expression of tight junction proteins. In addition, berberine was reported to restore aberrant levels of gut hormones in the portal plasma, such as glucagon‑like peptide‑1 and ‑2, peptide YY, glucose‑dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and pancreatic polypeptide. The present findings indicated that berberine, through modulating gut microbiota, restored the gut barrier, reduced metabolic  and systemic inflammation, and improved gut peptide levels in high‑fat diet‑fed rats. The present study suggests that berberine may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of obesity and insulin resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135706>Nicotine Improves Survivability, Hypotension, and Impaired Adenosinergic Renal Vasodilations in Endotoxic Rats: Role of α7-Nachrs/HO-1 Pathway.</a></h1><p>The nicotinic/cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway protects against acute kidney injury and other end-organ damages induced by . In this study, we tested the hypothesis that functional α7-nAChRs/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway is imperative for the nicotine counteraction of hemodynamic and renovascular dysfunction caused by acute  in rats. Renal vasodilations were induced by cumulative bolus injections of acetylcholine (ACh, 0.01 nmol-7.29 nmol) or ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA, adenosine receptor agonist, 1.6 nmol-100 nmol) in isolated phenylephrine-preconstricted perfused kidneys. The data showed that 6-h treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS,  mg/kg i.p.) decreased systolic blood pressure and renal vasodilations caused by NECA but not Ach. The endotoxic insult also increased the mortality rate and elevated serum urea and creatinine. These LPS effects were sex-unrelated, except hypotension, and enhanced mortality which were more evident in male rodents, and abrogated after co-administration of nicotine (0., 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent fashion. The advantageous effects of nicotine on NECA vasodilations, survivability, and kidney biomarkers in endotoxic male rats disappeared upon concurrent exposure to methyllycaconitine citrate (α7-nAChR blocker) or zinc protoporphyrin (HO-1 inhibitor) and were reproduced after treatment with bilirubin, but not hemin (HO-1 inducer) or tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer (carbon monoxide-releasing molecule). Together, current biochemical and pharmacological evidence suggests key roles for α7-nAChRs and the bilirubin byproduct of the HO-1 signaling in the nicotine counteraction of renal dysfunction and reduced adenosinergic renal vasodilator capacity in endotoxic rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28552958>Characterization of basal and lipopolysaccharide-induced microRNA expression in equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells using Next-Generation Sequencing.</a></h1><p>The innate immune response to lipopolysaccharide contributes substantially to the morbidity and mortality of gram-negative sepsis. Horses and humans share an exquisite sensitivity to lipopolysaccharide and thus the horse may provide valuable comparative insights into this aspect of the inflammatory response. MicroRNAs, small non-coding RNA molecules acting as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, have key roles in toll-like receptor signaling regulation but have not been studied in this context in horses. The central hypothesis of this study was that lipopolysaccharide induces differential microRNA expression in equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a manner comparable to humans. Illumina Next Generation Sequencing was used to characterize the basal microRNA transcriptome in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy adult horses, and to evaluate LPS-induced changes in microRNA expression in cells cultured for up to four hours. Selected expression changes were validated using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR. Only miR-155 was significantly upregulated by LPS, changing in parallel with supernatant tumor necrosis factor-α concentration. Eight additional microRNAs, including miR-146a and miR-146b, showed significant expression change with time in culture without a clear LPS effect. Target predictions indicated a number of potential immunity-associated targets for miR-155 in the horse, including SOCS1, TAB2 and elements of the PI3K signaling pathway, suggesting that it is likely to influence the acute inflammatory response to LPS. Gene alignment showed extensive conservation of the miR-155 precursor gene and associated promoter regions between horses and humans. The basal and LPS-stimulated microRNA expression pattern characterized here were similar to those described in human leukocytes. As well as providing a resource for further research into the roles of microRNAs in immune responses in horses, this will facilitate inter-species comparative study of the role of microRNAs in the inflammatory cascade during  and sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28990935>Caspase-11-mediated endothelial pyroptosis underlies -induced lung injury.</a></h1><p>Acute lung injury is a leading cause of death in bacterial sepsis due to the wholesale destruction of the lung endothelial barrier, which results in protein-rich lung edema, influx of proinflammatory leukocytes, and intractable hypoxemia. Pyroptosis is a form of programmed lytic cell death that is triggered by inflammatory caspases, but little is known about its role in EC death and acute lung injury. Here, we show that systemic exposure to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes severe endothelial pyroptosis that is mediated by the inflammatory caspases, human caspases 4/ in human ECs, or the murine homolog caspase-11 in mice in vivo. In caspase-11-deficient mice, BM transplantation with WT hematopoietic cells did not abrogate -induced acute lung injury, indicating a central role for nonhematopoietic caspase-11 in . Additionally, conditional deletion of caspase-11 in ECs reduced -induced lung edema, neutrophil accumulation, and death. These results establish the requisite role of endothelial pyroptosis in endotoxemic tissue injury and suggest that endothelial inflammatory caspases are an important therapeutic target for acute lung injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28346237>Current and future pharmacologic treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer in -15% of patients and is rapidly becoming the leading cause for end-stage liver disease. Dietary caloric restriction and exercise, currently the cornerstone of therapy for NAFLD, can be difficult to achieve and maintain, underscoring the dire need for pharmacotherapy. This review presents the agents currently used in managing NAFLD and their pharmacologic targets. It also provides an overview of NAFLD agents currently under development.Therapies for NASH can be broadly classified into agents that target the metabolic perturbations driving disease pathogenesis (such as insulin resistance and de novo lipogenesis) and agents that target downstream processes including cell stress, apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors, farnesoid-X-receptors, and the glucagon-like peptide 1 pathway have been shown to improve liver histology. The intestinal microbiome and metabolic  are novel targets that are currently under review. Antioxidants such as vitamin E, and more recently anti-inflammatory agents such as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 inhibitors show promise as therapy for NASH. Several antifibrotic agents including cysteine-cysteine motif chemokine receptor type 2 and type  antagonists have been shown to inhibit the progression of fibrosis toward cirrhosis.There are currently several agents in the drug pipeline for NASH. Within the next few years, the availability of therapeutic options for NAFLD will hopefully curb the rising trend of NAFLD-related end stage liver disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156464>Physiological and Pathophysiological Consequences of a 25-Day Ultra-Endurance Exercise Challenge.</a></h1><p> This case-report characterized the respiratory, cardiovascular, and nutritional/gastrointestinal (GI) responses of a trained individual to a novel ultra-endurance exercise challenge.  A male athlete (age 45 years;  Omax 54.0 mL⋅kg⋅min) summited 100 mountains on foot in 25 consecutive days (all elevations >600 m).  Laboratory measures of pulmonary function (spirometry, whole-body plethysmography, and single-breath rebreathe), respiratory muscle function (maximum static mouth-pressures), and cardiovascular structure and function (echocardiography, electrocardiography, large vessel ultrasound, and flow-mediated dilatation) were made at baseline and 48 h post-challenge. Dietary intake (four-day food diary), self-reported GI symptoms and plasma endotoxin concentrations were assessed at baseline, pre/post mid-point, pre/post end-point, and 48 h post-challenge.  The challenge was completed in a total exercise time of 142 h (.3 ± 2.8 h⋅d), with a distance of 1141 km (42.3 ± 43.9 km⋅d), and energy expenditure of 80460 kcal (2980 ± 1451 kcal⋅d). Relative to baseline, there were post-challenge decreases in pulmonary capacities and expiratory flows (≤34%), maximum expiratory mouth-pressure (19%), and maximum voluntary ventilation (29%). Heart rate variability deteriorated, manifesting as a 48% decrease in the root mean square of successive differences and a 70% increase in the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio. Pre- to post-challenge endotoxin concentrations were elevated by 60%, with a maximum increase of 130% after a given stage, congruent with an increased frequency and severity of GI symptoms.  The challenge resulted in pulmonary and autonomic dysfunction, , and GI distress.

On the one hand, obesity and associated pathologies (also known as the metabolic syndrome) affect more than 10% of the world population. Such pathologies might arise from an elevated inflammatory tone. We have discovered that the inflammatory properties of high-fat diets were linked to the translocation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We proposed a mechanism associating the gut microbiota with the onset of insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation, a phenomenon that we called "metabolic ." We and others have shown that bacteria as well as host-derived immune-related elements control microbial communities and eventually contribute to the phenotype observed during diet-induced obesity, diabetes, and metabolic inflammation. On the other hand, undernutrition is one of the leading causes of death in children. A diet poor in energy and/or nutrients causes incomplete development of the gut microbiota and may profoundly affect energy absorption, initiating stunted growth, edema, and diarrhea. In this review, we discuss how changes in microbiota composition are associated with obesity and undernutrition. We also highlight that opposite consequences exist in terms of energy absorption from the diet (obesity versus undernutrition), but interestingly the two situations share similar defects in term of diversity, functionality, and inflammatory potential.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30039349>Bacterial supernatants elevate glucose-dependent insulin secretion in rat pancreatic INS-1 line and islet β-cells via PI3K/AKT signaling.</a></h1><p>Diabetes and periodontitis are considered associated chronic diseases, and hyperinsulinemia in prediabetes has been shown to be present in normoglycemic animals with periodontitis. As periodontal bacterial species are significant sources of  and may directly stimulate insulin secretion, we hypothesized that increased bacterial virulence may exert an adverse effect on rat pancreatic β-cell function via PI3K/AKT signaling. INS-1 cells and isolated pancreatic islets were cultured separately with the following supernatants: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g), and Treponema denticola (T.d). Supernatants were purified from single bacterial cultures and prepared at different dilutions (100 pg/ml, 50 ng/ml, 200 ng/ml, and 500 ng/ml) to challenge INS-1 and islets. Gene expression (IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, TLR2, TLR4, Ins1, and Ins2) and insulin secretion were measured. The results showed upregulation of gene expression up to .-fold, not only as a result of the different dilutions used, but also due to bacterial virulence (p < 0.05). P.g and T.d supernatants demonstrated an increase in insulin secretion to fivefold at hypo- and hyperglycemia, yet stimulation from hypo- to hyperglycemia stays in the same ratio. Activation of TLR4/PI3K/AKT signaling by supernatants in INS-1 cells resulted in increased IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6 gene expression levels, and AKT phosphorylation, which were abolished by TLR4 and PI3K/AKT signaling inhibitor. We demonstrated that bacterial supernatants derived from gram-negative species increasingly stimulate insulin secretion in β-cells and TLR4 may promote inflammation by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to induce pro-inflammatory molecules. Bacterial species, depending on their virulence, appear to play a role in the relationship between periodontitis and prediabetes by promoting insulin resistance and β-cell compensatory response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28960346>CREB Protein Mediates Alcohol-Induced Circadian Disruption and Intestinal Permeability.</a></h1><p>Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is commonly associated with intestinal permeability. An unanswered question is why only a subset of heavy alcohol drinkers develop . Recent studies suggest that circadian disruption is the susceptibility factor for alcohol-induced gut leakiness to endotoxins. The circadian protein PER2 is increased after exposure to alcohol and siRNA knockdown of PER2 in vitro blocks alcohol-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. We have shown that blocking CYP2E1 (i.e., important for alcohol metabolism) with siRNA inhibits the alcohol-induced increase in PER2 and suggesting that oxidative stress may mediate alcohol-induced increase in PER2 in intestinal epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether a mechanism incited by alcohol-derived oxidative stress mediates the transcriptional induction of PER2 and subsequent intestinal hyperpermeability.Caco-2 cells were exposed to 0.2% alcohol with or without pretreatment with modulators of oxidative stress or PKA activity. Permeability of the Caco-2 monolayer was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance. Protein expression was measured by Western blot and mRNA with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were fed with alcohol diet (29% of total calories, 4.% v/v) for 8 weeks. Western blot was used to analyze PER2 expression in mouse proximal colon tissue.Alcohol increased oxidative stress, caused Caco-2 cell monolayer dysfunction, and increased levels of the circadian clock proteins PER2 and CLOCK. These effects were mitigated by pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with an antioxidant scavenger. Alcohol-derived oxidative stress activated cAMP response element-binding (CREB) via the PKA pathway and increased PER2 mRNA and protein. Inhibiting CREB prevented the increase in PER2 and Caco-2 cell monolayer hyperpermeability.Taken together, these data suggest that strategies to reduce alcohol-induced oxidative stress may alleviate alcohol-mediated circadian disruption and intestinal leakiness, critical drivers of ALD.Copyright © 2017 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062264>Does the Administration of Sevelamer or Nicotinamide Modify Uremic Toxins or  in Chronic Hemodialysis Patients?</a></h1><p>Hyperphosphatemia control is a major issue in hemodialysis patients. Both sevelamer and nicotinamide are prescribed for this purpose. In addition, they exert pleiotropic effects such as an improvement of inflammatory status and potentially enhanced clearance of uremic toxins. In the present secondary analysis of the NICOREN trial, we investigated the impact of sevelamer and nicotinamide on uremic toxins, toxin precursors, and  in chronic hemodialysis patients.Circulating uremic toxins (including phenylacetylglutamine, trimethylamine-N-oxide, p-cresyl sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, kynurenine, hippuric acid, indole-3-acetic acid, 3-carboxy-4-methyl--propyl-2-furanpropionic acid, kynurenic acid, and p-cresyl glucuronide) and precursors were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and urea, uric acid, phosphate, C-reactive protein, and intact parathyroid hormone by routine biochemistry methods. Serum endotoxin (evaluated by lipopolysaccharide levels) and C-terminal fibroblast growth factor-23 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.One hundred hemodialysis patients were randomized to receive either nicotinamide or sevelamer treatment. Among them, 63% were male, mean (± standard deviation) age was 65 ± 14 years, 47% had diabetes mellitus, and 51% had a history of cardiovascular disease. In the sevelamer group, but not the nicotinamide group, serum levels of urea, uric acid, and fibroblast growth factor-23 were significantly reduced after 6 months of treatment. The other circulating uremic toxins and toxin precursors remained unchanged in response to either phosphate-lowering agent. Sevelamer treatment led to a marked decrease in serum lipopolysaccharide (p < 0.001) whereas nicotinamide treatment induced an only modest decrease of borderline significance (p = 0.057). There was no change in C-reactive protein levels.In contrast to sevelamer, nicotinamide did not reduce circulating levels of low-molecular-weight uremic toxins other than phosphate, and neither agent reduced circulating uremic toxins of high-molecular-weight or protein-bound toxins. Sevelamer, but not nicotinamide, reduced serum endotoxin levels. Despite no change in serum C-reactive protein, the endotoxin-lowering effect of sevelamer may help to attenuate the inflammatory status of patients with chronic kidney disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28290713>The influence of growth and E. coli  on amoxicillin pharmacokinetics in turkeys.</a></h1><p>1.

Hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) has been implicated in transcriptional regulation of intestinal barrier integrity and inflammation. We aimed to test the hypothesis that HIF-1α plays a critical role in gut microbiota homeostasis and the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity in a mouse model of ALD.Wild-type (WT) and intestinal epithelial-specific Hif1a knockout mice (IEhif1α) were pair-fed modified Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing % (w/v) alcohol or isocaloric maltose dextrin for 24 days. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and endotoxin were determined. Fecal microbiota were assessed. Liver steatosis and injury, and intestinal barrier integrity were evaluated.Alcohol feeding increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and lipopolysaccharide, hepatic triglyceride concentration, and liver injury in the WT mice. These deleterious effects were exaggerated in IEhif1α mice. Alcohol exposure resulted in greater reduction of the expression of intestinal epithelial tight junction proteins, claudin-1 and occludin, in IEhif1α mice. In addition, cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide and intestinal trefoil factor were further decreased by alcohol in IEhif1α mice. Metagenomic analysis showed increased gut dysbiosis and significantly decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in IEhif1α mice compared to the WT mice exposed to alcohol. An increased abundance of Akkermansia and a decreased level of Lactobacillus in IEhif1α mice were also observed. Non-absorbable antibiotic treatment reversed the liver steatosis in both WT and IEhif1α mice.Intestinal HIF-1α is essential for the adaptative response to alcohol-induced changes in intestinal microbiota and barrier function associated with elevated  and hepatic steatosis and injury.Alcohol consumption alters gut microbiota and multiple intestinal barrier protecting factors that are regulated by intestinal hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). Absence of intestinal HIF-1α exacerbates gut leakiness leading to an increased translocation of bacteria and bacterial products to the liver, consequently causing alcoholic liver disease. Intestinal specific upregulation of HIF-1α could be developed as a novel approach for the treatment of alcoholic liver disease.Copyright © 2018 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

This study investigated (i) the nicotine modulation of hemodynamic and renal vasodilatory responses to  in rats, and (ii) roles of α7 or α4β2-nAChRs and related HSP70/TNFα/iNOS signaling in the interaction. was induced by ip lipopolysaccharide ( mg/kg/day, for 2 days) and changes in systolic blood pressure and vasodilator responsiveness of isolated perfused kidney to acetylcholine or '-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA, adenosine receptor agonist) were evaluated.Lipopolysaccharide had no effect on serum creatinine, reduced blood pressure, and increased renal vasodilations induced by acetylcholine or NECA in male and female preparations. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that lipopolysaccharide reduced renal HSP70 expression, but increased α7-nAChRs, α4β2-nAChRs and iNOS expressions. The co-administration of aminoguanidine (iNOS inhibitor), pentoxifylline (TNFα inhibitor), or nicotine attenuated lipopolysaccharide mediation of renal vasodilations and elevations in α7/α4β2-nAChR and iNOS expressions. Nicotine also reversed the downregulating effect of lipopolysaccharide on HSP70 expression. α7-nAChRs (methyllycaconitine citrate, MLA) or α4β2-nAChRs (dihydro-β-erythroidine, DHβE) blockade potentiated the lipopolysaccharide enhancement of renal vasodilations, and abolished the depressant effect of nicotine on lipopolysaccharide responses. A similar abolition of nicotine effects was seen after HSP70 inhibition by quercetin. Alternatively, lipopolysaccharide hypotension was eliminated in rats treated with DHβE/nicotine or quercetin/nicotine regimen in contrast to no effect for nicotine alone or combined with MLA.These findings establish that nicotine offsets lipopolysaccharide facilitation of renal vasodilations possibly through a crosstalk between HSP70 and nAChRs of the α7 and α4β2 types.Copyright © 2019 Maj Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

However, precise checkpoints are required to prevent their unsolicited activation. Here we report that serpin family B member 1 (SERPINB1) limited the activity of those caspases by suppressing their caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) oligomerization and enzymatic activation. While the reactive center loop of SERPINB1 inhibits neutrophil serine proteases, its carboxy-terminal CARD-binding motif restrained the activation of pro-caspase-1/-4/-/-11. Consequently, knockdown or deletion of SERPINB1 prompted spontaneous activation of caspase-1/-4/-/-11, release of the cytokine IL-1β and pyroptosis, inducing elevated inflammation after non-hygienic co-housing with pet-store mice and enhanced sensitivity to lipopolysaccharide- or Acinetobacter baumannii-induced . Our results reveal that SERPINB1 acts as a vital gatekeeper of inflammation by restraining neutrophil serine proteases and inflammatory caspases in a genetically and functionally separable manner.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849138>Construction of a lentiviral vector containing shRNA targeting ADAM17 and its role in attenuating  in mice.</a></h1><p>Systemic inflammatory response syndrome is a pathophysiological inflammatory response mediated largely by tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α), in response to infectious or non‑infectious stimuli. TNF‑α secretion in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is regulated in part by disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain‑containing protein 17 (ADAM17). Therefore, the present study aimed to identify an effective inhibitor of ADAM17, in order to control inflammation and associated processes. In the present study, a lentiviral vector expressing short hairpin (sh)RNA targeting the ADAM17 gene was constructed. U937 cells were infected with the lentivirus and stimulated with LPS. ADAM17 expression was assessed by western blotting and TNF‑α secretion was assessed by ELISA analysis. The lentivirus was additionally tested in vivo in a mouse model of  and sTNF‑α expression was assessed by flow cytometry in peritoneal macrophages. In vitro, the ADAM17 shRNA lentivirus reduced ADAM17 expression, and prevented TNF‑α maturation in U937 cells. In vivo, mice exposed to the ADAM17 shRNA lentivirus prior to LPS‑induced  exhibited fewer signs of inflammation and less tissue damage compared with the control mice. In conclusion, the present study successfully constructed a shRNA lentiviral vector targeting the ADAM17 gene that exhibited apparent in vitro and in vivo effects on TNF‑α processing in response to an LPS challenge. The results of the present study may aid the design and improvement of drugs designed to inhibit the function of ADAM17, and suggested a novel means of controlling inflammation and associated processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30389960>Human Defensin- Blocks Ethanol and Colitis-Induced Dysbiosis, Tight Junction Disruption and Inflammation in Mouse Intestine.</a></h1><p>Alcohol consumption has been shown to cause dysbiosis, but the mechanism involved in it is unknown. Recurrent colitis is known to induce expression of α-defensins in the colon, but the effect of alcohol consumption on it is not known. We investigated the effect of ethanol on α-defensin expression in the small intestine and colitis-induced expression in colon in mice. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of human defensin- (HD5) on ethanol and colitis-induced gut barrier dysfunction and mucosal damage. Recurrent colitis was induced by feeding dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), 3 cycles of -days each with 15 days intervals, followed by 30-days remission. Ethanol was fed during the intervals and recovery in a liquid diet with or without HD5. Expression of α-defensins, tight junction (TJ) integrity and cytokine/chemokine expression were analyzed. Chronic ethanol feeding reduced α-defensin expression in the small intestine and colitis-induced defensin expression in the colon. HD5 attenuated the growth of enterotoxigenic Bacteriodes fragilis and E. coli, but had no effect on non-toxigenic Bacteriodes fragilis or probiotics, the Lactobacilli. Ethanol and colitis elevated Enterobacteriaceae, Firmicutes and Firmicutes to Bacteriodetes ratio in colonic mucosa. HD5 feeding attenuated ethanol and colitis-induced dysbiosis, disruption of intestinal epithelial TJ, mucosal inflammation, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the small intestine and colon, and . These results demonstrate that ethanol suppresses intestinal α-defensin expression, leading to dysbiosis, barrier dysfunction, inflammation and . HD5 feeding attenuates intestinal injury caused by ethanol and colitis, indicating that defensin expression is a potential target for treatment of alcoholic tissue injury and colitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29310561>Endotoxin Activity in Neonates Undergoing Cardiac Surgery: Cohort Study.</a></h1><p> in pediatric cardiac surgical patients is poorly understood. The endotoxin activity assay (EAA) levels were examined in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery in order to assess their reference levels and their association with other pre-, intra-, and postoperative risk factors for gut hypoperfusion. We finally observed if refeeding was associated with modification of endotoxin levels.In a prospective cohort study, neonates undergoing surgery for correction or palliation were enrolled. Preterm birth, weight below 1. kg, the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and urgent surgery were exclusion criteria.Among the 26 enrolled neonates, 12 underwent on-pump and 14 off-pump surgery, 22 received a preoperative infusion of prostaglandin E2. Overall, 11 patients were surgically corrected and 15 received a palliation. Endotoxin activity assay baseline levels were inversely correlated with age at surgery ( r = -.50, P = .006) and they increased to postoperative day2 ( P = .002). On-pump versus off-pump surgery ( P =.36) and surgical palliation with a Blalock-Taussig shunt versus correction ( P = .45) did not predict increase in EAA levels. Aortic clamping for coarctation repair was associated with the lowest levels ( P = .04). Systolic, mean, and diastolic pressures were associated with EAA levels ( r = -.55, P = .01; r = -.45, P = .02; r = -.37, P = .04, respectively). Endotoxin activity assay levels after refeeding were similar to baseline levels. Patients with abdominal distension and feeding intolerance showed higher median peak EAA levels (0.7, 0.66-1.11) than asymptomatic patients (0.53, 0.35-0.64; P = .01).Endotoxin activity assay levels increase after elective neonatal surgery and are not modified by refeeding.

We investigated the role of burn-induced gastrointestinal dysmotility (BIGD) in promoting bacterial translocation following burn injury, and the protective effect of ghrelin in this process.We assessed gastric emptying (GE%) and intestinal transit (IT by geometric center "GC") in a 60% total body surface area scald burn rat model and measured bacterial counts in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and distal small intestine by colony-forming unit per gram of tissue (CFU/g). A group of animals was treated with ghrelin or saline after burn.Scald burn was associated with a significant delay in GE (62% ± 4% vs 74% ± 4%; P = .02) and a trend of delay in intestinal transit (GC: . ± 0.1 vs .8 ± 0.2; P = .09). Concurrently, there was a marginal increase in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (6 × 10 vs 2 × 10  CFU/g; P = .05) and significant translocation to MLN (2 × 10 vs 4 × 10 ; P = .03). We observed a negative correlation between GE and intestinal bacterial overgrowth (r  = -0.61; P = .002) and between IT and translocation (r  = -0.63; P = .004). Ghrelin administration significantly accelerated GE following burn injury (91% ± 3% vs 62% ± 4; P = .03), reduced small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and completely inhibited translocation to MLN (0.0 vs  × 10 ; P = .01).Burn-induced gastrointestinal dysmotility is correlated with the systemic translocation of gram-negative gut bacteria that are implicated in multiple organ failure in burn patients.

However, the role and regulation of neutrophils related to nonresolving inflammation and atherosclerosis are poorly understood. We report herein that chronic subclinical , a risk factor for atherosclerosis, skewed neutrophils into a nonresolving inflammatory state with elevated levels of inflammatory mediators (Dectin-1, MMP9, and LTB4) and reduced levels of homeostatic mediators (LRRC32, TGFβ, and FPN). The polarization of neutrophils was due to ROS-mediated activation of oxCAMKII, caused by altered peroxisome homeostasis and reduced lysosome fusion. Application of 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) enhanced peroxisome homeostasis of neutrophils, reduced oxCAMKII, and rebalanced the expression profiles of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. Adoptive transfer of neutrophils programmed by subclinical  rendered exacerbated atherosclerosis. In contrast, transfer of ex vivo programmed neutrophils by 4-PBA reduced the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

The present study tested the anti-inflammatory activity of two novel non-steroidal GRMs (GRM1: BI 607812 BS, GRM2: BI 653048 BS*H3PO4) in comparison to prednisolone in a canine model of low dose . This study compared the anti-inflammatory and pharmacokinetic profile of escalating daily oral doses of GRM1 (1, 2.,  and 10mg/kg) and GRM2 (0.1, 0.25 and 1mg/kg) with prednisolone (0.25 and 0.5mg/kg) and placebo after intravenous infusion of endotoxin (0.1μg/kg) to Beagle dogs. This was followed by a 14-day evaluation study of safety and pharmacokinetics. Endotoxin challenge increased TNF-α ∼2000-fold and interleukin-6 (IL-6) 100-fold. Prednisolone and both GRMs suppressed peak TNF-α and IL-6 by 71-82% as compared with placebo. The highest doses of GRM1 and GRM2 reduced the mean body temperature increase by ∼30%. The endotoxin-induced rise in plasma cortisol was strongly suppressed in all treatment groups. Pharmacokinetics of both GRMs were non-linear. Adverse effects of  such as vomiting were mitigated by GRM2 and prednisolone, indicating an antiemetic effect. During the 14-day treatment period, the adverse event profile of both GRMs appeared to be similar to prednisolone. Both GRMs had anti-inflammatory effects comparable to prednisolone and showed good safety profiles. Compounds targeting the glucocorticoid receptor selectively may provide an alternative to traditional glucocorticoids in the treatment of inflammatory disease.Copyright © 2017.

However, the repeated administration of LPS leads to desensitization of hypophagia, which is associated with increased hypothalamic p-AMPK expression. Because ghrelin and endocannabinoids modulate AMPK activity in the hypothalamus, we hypothesized that these neuromodulators play a role in the reversal of tolerance to hypophagia in rats under long-term exposure to LPS. Male Wistar rats were treated with single (1 LPS, 100μg/kg body weight, ip) or repeated injections of LPS over 6days (6 LPS). Food intake was reduced in the 1 LPS, but not in the 6 LPS group. 6 LPS rats showed an increased serum concentration of acylated ghrelin and reduced ghrelin receptor mRNA expression in the hypothalamus. Ghrelin injection (40μg/kg body weight, ip) increased food intake, body weight gain, p-AMPK hypothalamic expression, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Agouti related peptide (AgRP) mRNA expression in control animals (Saline). However, in 6 LPS rats, ghrelin did not alter these parameters. Central administration of a CB1R antagonist (AM251, 200ng/μl in μl/rat) induced hypophagia in 6 LPS animals, suggesting that the endocannabinoid system contributes to preserved food intake during LPS tolerance. In the presence of AM251, the ability of ghrelin to phosphorylate AMPK in the hypothalamus of 6 LPS group was restored, but not its orexigenic effect. Our data highlight that the orexigenic effects of ghrelin require CB1R signaling downstream of AMPK activation. Moreover, CB1R-mediated pathways contribute to the absence of hypophagia during repeated exposure to endotoxin.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study was to compare survival in a sepsis model where large swine had  induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and were treated with intravenous hydroxocobalamin (HOC), noradrenaline (NA), or saline. Thirty swine (45-55 kg) were anaesthetized, intubated, and instrumented with continuous femoral and pulmonary artery pressure monitoring. Hypotension, predefined as 50% of baseline, was induced with LPS. Animals then received HOC, NA, or saline and monitored for 3 hours. The main outcome was survival to the conclusion of the study. Using a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05, 10 animals were used per group. Secondary outcomes included: mean arterial pressure (MAP), systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and cardiac output (CO) along with several markers of sepsis. No differences were detected between groups at baseline or after hypotension. The survival distributions of the three groups were significantly different with more HOC animals surviving (10/10) compared with NA (8/10) or Saline (/10) (log-rank P < 0.03). MAP was found to be higher in both the HOC and NA groups and HOC achieved the highest SVR.

The second objective was a study of whether increased expression of the LPS receptor complex led to increases in the concentrations of plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and serum Ca. Three hundred five dairy cows located in 13 Polish high-yielding dairy commercial farms were selected according to their days in milk (40-150 d; average = 75), 305-d milk yield (10,070-12,041 kg; average = 10,940), and number of lactations (primiparous, n = 139 and multiparous, n = 166). Next, the herds were segregated into 3 groups based on the percentages of cows with an assigned value of ruminal fluid pH: SARA-positive, SARA-risk, and SARA-negative herds. Moreover, 305 selected dairy cows were divided according to the classification based on ruminal fluid pH into 3 groups as healthy (pH >.81), risk (pH .8-.6) and acidotic cows (pH <.6). Rumen fluid samples were collected via rumenocentesis. In the AC group, we recorded higher concentrations of ruminal free LPS [4.57 Log endotoxin units (EU)/mL; 42,206 EU/mL] compared with the healthy group (4.48 Log EU/mL; 34,179 EU/mL). Similarly, the concentration of ruminal free LPS was higher in SARA-positive herds (4.60 Log EU/mL; 43,000 EU/mL) compared with SARA-negative herds (4.47 Log EU/mL; 32,225 EU/mL). The relative mRNA abundance of genes associated with the function of LPS receptors, such as CD14, TLR4, and MD2, in white blood cells differed between all experimental groups on both cow and herd levels. In the acidotic group, we recorded higher concentrations of HDL (78.16 vs. 68.32 mg/dL) and serum amyloid A (10.80 vs. 9.16 µg/mL) and lower concentrations of Ca (8.26 vs. 10.16 mg/dL) and haptoglobin (470.19 vs. 516.85 ng/mL) compared with the healthy group. Similar results were obtained in the SARA herd status analysis, but the concentration of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein differed statistically. Moreover, the pH of ruminal fluid was negatively correlated with relative mRNA abundance of genes such as CD14, TLR4, MD2, and concentrations of serum HDL and serum amyloid A, although positively correlated with serum Ca. The results indicated that decreases in ruminal fluid pH increased the release of free LPS into the rumen and stimulated the expression of the LPS receptor complex and immune response. Moreover, an increase in the expression of the LPS receptor led to higher concentrations of plasma HDL and lower serum Ca, which may be a protective mechanism against .

Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) is a context-dependent regulator of vascular leakage that signals via both endothelial TEK receptor tyrosine kinase (TIE2) and integrins. Here, we show that antibodies against β1-integrin decrease LPS-induced vascular leakage in murine , as either a preventative or an intervention therapy. β1-integrin inhibiting antibodies bound to the vascular endothelium in vivo improved the integrity of endothelial cell-cell junctions and protected mice from -associated cardiac failure, without affecting endothelial inflammation, serum proinflammatory cytokine levels, or TIE receptor signaling. Moreover, conditional deletion of a single allele of endothelial β1-integrin protected mice from LPS-induced vascular leakage. In endothelial monolayers, the inflammatory agents thrombin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and IL-1β decreased junctional vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and induced actin stress fibers via β1- and α-integrins and ANGPT2. Additionally, β1-integrin inhibiting antibodies prevented inflammation-induced endothelial cell contractility and monolayer permeability. Mechanistically, the inflammatory agents stimulated ANGPT2-dependent translocation of αβ1-integrin into tensin-1-positive fibrillar adhesions, which destabilized the endothelial monolayer. Thus, β1-integrin promotes endothelial barrier disruption during inflammation, and targeting β1-integrin signaling could serve as a novel means of blocking pathological vascular leak.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

The anti-inflammatory effects of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator metformin in sepsis has been revealed. However, the underlying mechanisms remain not fully understood. In the present study, the potential roles of histone deacetylase  (HDAC5) and kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) in the effects of metformin on endothelial pro-inflammatory responses were investigated. The results showed that metformin pretreatment increased the phosphorylation of HDAC5 at serine 498, leading to the upregulation of KLF2, and eliminated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor ⍺ (TNF⍺)-induced upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). Furthermore, the adhesion of HL60 leukocytes to endothelial monolayer was effectively inhibited by metformin. In addition, the in vivo data confirmed that AMPK activation attenuated local and systemic inflammation in endotoxic mice induced by LPS via mediating phosphorylating HDAC5 and restoring KLF2 expression. Our findings revealed that AMPK activation-mediated HDAC5 phosphorylation and KLF2 restoration is, at least partially, responsible to the anti-inflammatory effects of metformin in -induced endothelial cells, which has important implications for the future development of interfering therapies of sepsis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We plotted LVSW min against CPO by linear regression analysis, as well as against the following classical indices of LV function and work: LV ejection fraction (LV EF), rate-pressure product (RPP), triple product (TP), LV maximum pressure (LVP) and maximal rate of rise of LVP (LV dP/dt).CPO showed the best correlation with LV SW min (r = 0.89; p < 0.05) while LV EF did not correlate at all (r = 0.01; p = 0.259). Further parameters correlated moderately with LV SW min (LVP r = 0.47, RPP r = 0.67; and TP r = 0.54).

After 4 weeks, each group received saline or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ( mg/kg) intraperitoneally during the postprandial (PPP) or postabsorptive (PAP) periods. Blood glucose was measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes. Serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL) 6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Distribution of serum fatty acids was determined by gas liquid chromatography. Hepatic expression of genes involved in inflammation, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism, were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.During the PPP, glucose curves were comparable among the experimental groups. During the PAP, EKD showed a more pronounced increase in glucose levels at the first hour after LPS challenge compared with the CD-LPS group.

Noradrenergic neurons have been identified to be a specific site of pepcan production. However, it remains unknown whether pepcans occur in the periphery and interact with peripheral CB2 cannabinoid receptors. Here, it is shown that pepcan-12 acts as a potent (K  value ~50 nM) hCB2 receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM). It significantly potentiated the effects of CB2 receptor agonists, including the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), for [35S]GTPγS binding and cAMP inhibition (-10 fold). In mice, the putative precursor pepcan-23 (SALSDLHAHKLRVDPVNFKLLSH) was identified with pepcan-12 in brain, liver and kidney. Pepcan-12 was increased upon  and ischemia reperfusion damage where CB2 receptors play a protective role. The adrenals are a major endocrine site of production/secretion of constitutive pepcan-12, as shown by its marked loss after adrenalectomy. However, upon I/R damage pepcan-12 was strongly increased in the liver (from ~100 pmol/g to ~500 pmol/g) independent of adrenals. The wide occurrence of this endogenous hormone-like CB2 receptor PAM, with unforeseen opposite allosteric effects on cannabinoid receptors, suggests its potential role in peripheral pathophysiological processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425383>Exercise Training Modulates Gut Microbiota Profile and Improves .</a></h1><p>Intestinal metabolism and microbiota profiles are impaired in obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover, dysbiotic gut microbiota has been suggested to promote systemic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance through the release of endotoxins particularly lipopolysaccharides. We have previously shown that exercise training improves intestinal metabolism in healthy men. To understand whether changes in intestinal metabolism interact with gut microbiota and its release of inflammatory markers, we studied the effects of sprint interval (SIT) and moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) on intestinal metabolism and microbiota in insulin resistance.Twenty-six, sedentary subjects (prediabetic n=9, T2D n=17; age 49[SD 4] years; BMI 30.[SD 3]) were randomized into SIT or MICT. Intestinal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (GU) and fatty acid uptake (FAU) from circulation were measured using PET. Gut microbiota composition was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and serum inflammatory markers with multiplex assays and enzyme-linked immunoassay kit.VO2peak improved only after SIT (p=0.01). Both training modes reduced systematic and intestinal inflammatory markers (TNF α, LBP) (time p<0.05). Training modified microbiota profile by increasing Bacteroidetes phylum (time p=0.03) and decreasing Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (time p=0.04). Moreover, there was a decrease in Clostridium genus (time p=0.04) and Blautia (time p=0.051). Only MICT decreased jejunal FAU (p=0.02). Training had no significant effect on intestinal GU. Colonic GU associated positively with Bacteroidetes and inversely with Firmicutes phylum, ratio Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and Blautia genus.Intestinal substrate uptake associates with gut microbiota composition and activity and whole-body insulin sensitivity.

To address this issue, we evaluated Nox2 activation, oxidative stress, gut permeability, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serum levels in 67 children with biopsy-proven NAFLD and 73 controls. Compared with controls, NAFLD patients had higher Nox2 activity, isoprostane, zonulin, and LPS levels. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), homeostatic model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), LPS, and isoprostanes were independently associated with Nox2-derivative peptide (sNox2-dp) levels. Within the NAFLD group, patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) had significant higher levels of sNox2-dp, isoprostanes, LPS, triglycerides, HOMA-IR, fasting glucose and insulin, and lower HDL than those without NASH. Furthermore, sNox2-dp levels were linearly associated with the histological grading of steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, fibrosis, and NAFLD activity score. This study provides evidence that children with NAFLD have Nox2 overactivation compared with controls and significant association with the degree of liver damage. The close relationship between Nox2 and LPS serum levels leads to hypothesize a potential role for gut-derived LPS in eliciting systemic Nox2 activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28410273>Up-regulation of Intracellular Calcium Handling Underlies the Recovery of Endotoxemic Cardiomyopathy in Mice.</a></h1><p>In surviving patients, sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy is spontaneously reversible. In the absence of any experimental data, it is generally thought that cardiac recovery in sepsis simply follows the remission of systemic inflammation. Here the authors aimed to identify the myocardial mechanisms underlying cardiac recovery in endotoxemic mice.Male C57BL/6 mice were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (7 μg/g, intraperitoneally) and followed for 12 days. The authors assessed survival, cardiac function by echocardiography, sarcomere shortening, and calcium transients (with fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester) in electrically paced cardiomyocytes ( Hz, 37°C) and myocardial protein expression by immunoblotting.Left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiomyocyte sarcomere shortening, and calcium transients were depressed 12 h after lipopolysaccharide challenge, started to recover by 24 h (day 1), and were back to baseline at day 3. The recovery of calcium transients at day 3 was associated with the up-regulation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump to 139 ± 19% (mean ± SD) of baseline and phospholamban down-regulation to 35 ± 20% of baseline. At day 6, calcium transients were increased to 123 ± 31% of baseline, associated with increased sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium load (to 126 ± 32% of baseline, as measured with caffeine) and inhibition of sodium/calcium exchange (to 48 ± 12% of baseline).In mice surviving lipopolysaccharide challenge, the natural recovery of cardiac contractility was associated with the up-regulation of cardiomyocyte calcium handling above baseline levels, indicating the presence of an active myocardial recovery process, which included sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump activation, the down-regulation of phospholamban, and sodium/calcium exchange inhibition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28925127>[Mechanism of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma combined with Scutellariae Radix on liver inflammation in rats with endotoxin disease based on p38MAPK pathway].</a></h1><p>To explore the mechanism of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma combined with Scutellariae Radix in regulatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver inflammation in rats with endotoxin blood, 50 male SD rats were selected and randomly divided into blank group, model group, dexamethasone group, herbal pair high dose group, herbal pair low dose group, with 10 in each group. Rats in each were given preventive drugs for 7 consecutive days. At 0. h after the final administration, the model was built through the tail vein injection with LPS ( mg•kg⁻¹). Then, animal anal temperatures were determined and recorded once every 0. h. The rats were killed at 4 h after the modeling to determine spleen thymus coefficient. ELISA method was used to detect cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in liver tissues. The colorimetric method was applied in determination of oxidation nitrogen (NO) content in liver tissues. Western Blot method was adopted to detect Toll-like receptor protein 4, p38MAPK p38MAPK, phosphorylated p38MAPK (p-p38MAPK) and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expressions. The results showed that compared with the blank group, in the model group, TLR4 protein expression, iNOS protein expression and p38 phosphorylation expression, IL-1β, NO and TNF-α content increased significantly in liver tissues (P<0.05 or P<0.01). And compared with the model group, the herbal pair high dose group showed significantly reduction in IL-1β, NO and TNF-α expressions in rat liver tissues (P<0.05 or P<0.01), down-regulation in iNOS protein expression and p38 phosphorylation expression in rat liver tissues (P<0.05), but without significant up-regulation in TLR4 protein. Low-dose herbal pair can significantly reduce IL-1β and NO expression in model rat liver tissues (P<0.01), significantly down-regulate iNOS protein expression (P<0.01), with a slight down-regulation in phosphorylation of p38 but no statistical significance, and no reduction in TLR4 expression. In conclusion, the compatibility of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma combined with Scutellariae Radix may reduce the expression of iNOS protein and the release of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, NO and TNF-α by decreasing p38 protein phosphorylation expression and blocking p38MAPK signaling pathways, so as to alleviate the inflammation reaction and protect the liver.Copyright© by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29763440>Endothelium-targeted delivery of dexamethasone by anti-VCAM-1 SAINT-O-Somes in mouse .</a></h1><p>Microvascular endothelial cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced inflammatory responses and multiple organ failure. Therefore, they represent an important target for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of sepsis. Glucocorticosteroids were widely used in the treatment of sepsis but vast evidence to support their systemic use is lacking. The limited effects of glucocorticoids in the treatment of sepsis may be explained by differential effects of drug initiated NF-κB inhibition in different cell types and insufficient drug delivery in target cells. The current study aimed therefore to investigate the effects of an endothelial targeted delivery of dexamethasone in a mouse model of  induced by two consecutive i.p. injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To achieve endothelial cell specific delivery of dexamethasone, we modified SAINT-O-Somes, a new generation of liposomes that contain the cationic amphiphile SAINT-C18 (1-methyl-4-(cis-9-dioleyl) methyl-pyridinium chloride, with antibodies against vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). In LPS challenged mice, the systemic administration of free dexamethasone had negligible effects on the microvascular inflammatory endothelial responses. Dexamethasone-loaded anti-VCAM-1 SAINT-O-Somes specifically localized at VCAM-1 expressing endothelial cells in the microvasculature of inflamed organs. This was associated with a marginal attenuation of the expression of a few pro-inflammatory genes in kidney and liver, while no effects in the lung were observed. This study reveals that, although local accumulation of the targeted drug was achieved, endothelial targeted dexamethasone containing anti-VCAM-1 SAINT-O-Somes exhibited marginal effects on inflammatory endothelial cell activation in a model of . Studies with more potent drugs encapsulated into anti-VCAM-1 SAINT-O-Somes will in the future reveal whether this delivery system can be further developed for efficacious endothelial directed delivery of drugs in the treatment of sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28803860>Intestinal permeability changes, systemic , inflammatory serum markers and sepsis after Whipple's operation for carcinoma of the pancreas head.</a></h1><p>The aim was to evaluate the relationship between failure of gut barrier function, inflammatory markers and septic complications after pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.44 patients were enrolled in this prospective observational clinical study and underwent curative open pancreatoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas. All patients underwent assessment of intestinal permeability using the lactulose/manitol excretions ratios (L/M ratio), , IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, and elastase levels before surgery and on postoperative days 1, 3 and 7. Septic complication was defined as a specific clinical condition related to infection by bacterium, virus, or fungus in a specific organ/compartment with positive culture.Septic complications developed in 25% of patients. There were no significant differences in preoperative L/M ratio, endotoxine, CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, and elastase levels between sepsis-positive and sepsis-negative groups. All patients showed a significant increase in intestinal permeability, , IL-1, IL-6, CRP and elastase on the first postoperative day.

Enteral nutrition (EN) is usually used to counteract hypercatabolism. However, the impact of different routes of EN on hypercatabolism remains unknown. Here, we compared the impact of gastric feeding (GF) and jejunal feeding (JF) on gastrointestinal hormones and hypercatabolism, which is associated with hypothalamic adenosine '-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-autophagy-proopiomelanocortin (POMC).Sixty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into  groups: Sham and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) groups fed a standard chow diet, a pair-fed group that was a subset of saline-treated rats pair-fed with the LPS group, and LPS + JF and LPS + GF groups (received EN via jejunal and gastric tube, respectively, for 3 days [100 kcal/kg/d]). Hypercatabolism was measured by insulin resistance, muscle protein synthesis, and atrophy. Serum gastrointestinal hormones, hypothalamic ghrelin, growth hormone secretagogue receptor-1α (GHS-R1α), and AMPK-autophagy-POMC markers were also detected.GF increased serum total, acylated, desacylated, and hypothalamic ghrelin and decreased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). But no effect on pancreatic polypeptide (PYY) and hypothalamic GHS-R1α was observed. JF showed no effect on hypothalamic ghrelin, GHS-R1α, and serum total, acylated, and desacylated ghrelin and even further aggravated GLP-1 and PYY. GF could effectively augment hypothalamic AMPK-autophagy-POMC and hypercatabolism. However, JF showed no effect on hypothalamic AMPK-autophagy-POMC and hypercatabolism.GF could activate hypothalamic AMPK-autophagy and suppress POMC expression via gastrointestinal hormones to ameliorate hypercatabolism compared with JF, which suggested that GF may be the preferred route of EN in endotoxemic rats.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28706520>Hypothermia Promotes Interleukin-22 Expression and Fine-Tunes Its Biological Activity.</a></h1><p>Disturbed homeostasis as a result of tissue stress can provoke leukocyte responses enabling recovery. Since mild hypothermia displays specific clinically relevant tissue-protective properties and interleukin (IL)-22 promotes healing at host/environment interfaces, effects of lowered ambient temperature on IL-22 were studied. We demonstrate that a -h exposure of endotoxemic mice to 4°C reduces body temperature by .0° and enhances splenic and colonic  gene expression. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-17A were not increased.  data on IL-22 were corroborated using murine splenocytes and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultured upon 33°C and polyclonal T cell activation. Upregulation by mild hypothermia of largely T-cell-derived IL-22 in PBMC required monocytes and associated with enhanced nuclear T-cell nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-c2. Notably, NFAT antagonism by cyclosporin A or FK506 impaired IL-22 upregulation at normothermia and entirely prevented its enhanced expression upon hypothermic culture conditions. Data suggest that intact NFAT signaling is required for efficient IL-22 induction upon normothermic and hypothermic conditions. Hypothermia furthermore boosted early signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation by IL-22 and shaped downstream gene expression in epithelial-like cells. Altogether, data indicate that hypothermia supports and fine-tunes IL-22 production/action, which may contribute to regulatory properties of low ambient temperature.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28991047>Vasopressors Do Not Influence Cerebral Critical Closing Pressure During Systemic Inflammation Evoked by Experimental  and Sepsis in Humans.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different vasopressors on the cerebral vasculature during experimental human  and sepsis.

In patients with sepsis, fluid resuscitation and vasopressor use was at the discretion of the medical team, aiming at normovolemia and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mm Hg, using noradrenaline.The mean flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MFVMCA) was measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD) with simultaneously recording of heart rate, arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. CrCP was estimated using the cerebrovascular impedance model.The CrCP decreased in the LPS-placebo group from 52.6 [46.6-55.] mm Hg at baseline to 44.1 [41.2-51.3] mm Hg at 270 min post-LPS (P = 0.03). Infusion of phenylephrine increased the CrCP in the period before LPS administration from 46.9 [38.8-53.4] to 53.8 [52.9-60.2] mm Hg (P = 0.02), but after LPS administration, a similar decrease was observed compared with the LPS-placebo group. Noradrenaline or vasopressin prior to LPS did not affect the CrCP. The decrease in CrCP after LPS bolus was similar in all treatment groups. The CrCP in the sepsis patients equaled 35.7 [34.4-42.0] mm Hg, and was lower compared with that in the LPS-placebo subjects from baseline until 90 min after LPS (P < 0.01).Experimental human  results in a decreased CrCP due to a loss of vascular resistance of the arterial bed.

We propose that a pro-inflammatory intestinal milieu, due to intestinal hyper-permeability and/or microbial dysbiosis, initiates or exacerbates PD pathogenesis. One factor that can cause intestinal hyper-permeability and dysbiosis is chronic stress which has been shown to accelerate neuronal degeneration and motor deficits in Parkinsonism rodent models. We hypothesized that stress-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and microbial dysbiosis lead to a pro-inflammatory milieu that exacerbates the PD phenotype in the low-dose oral rotenone PD mice model. To test this hypothesis, mice received unpredictable restraint stress (RS) for 12 weeks, and during the last six weeks mice also received a daily administration of low-dose rotenone (10 mg/kg/day) orally. The initial six weeks of RS caused significantly higher urinary cortisol, intestinal hyperpermeability, and decreased abundance of putative "anti-inflammatory" bacteria (Lactobacillus) compared to non-stressed mice. Rotenone alone (i.e., without RS) disrupted the colonic expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1, increased oxidative stress (N-tyrosine), increased myenteric plexus enteric glial cell GFAP expression and increased α-synuclein (α-syn) protein levels in the colon compared to controls. Restraint stress exacerbated these rotenone-induced changes. Specifically, RS potentiated rotenone-induced effects in the colon including: 1) intestinal hyper-permeability, 2) disruption of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin1), 3) oxidative stress (N-tyrosine), 4) inflammation in glial cells (GFAP + enteric glia cells), ) α-syn, 6) increased relative abundance of fecal Akkermansia (mucin-degrading Gram-negative bacteria), and 7) . In addition, RS promoted a number of rotenone-induced effects in the brain including: 1) reduced number of resting microglia and a higher number of dystrophic/phagocytic microglia as well as (FJ-C+) dying cells in the substantia nigra (SN), 2) increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reactivity in the SN, and 3) reduced dopamine (DA) and DA metabolites (DOPAC, HVA) in the striatum compared to control mice.

The ability of CSA to reverse the LPS effects disappeared in rats treated intracisternally (i.c.) with baclofen (selective GABA agonist, 2 μg/rat) but not muscimol (selective GABA agonist, 1 μg/rat), indicating a preferential compromising action for central GABA receptors on the advantageous effects of CSA. Moreover, the improvement by CSA of LPS-evoked cardiovascular derangements was also eliminated after concurrent i.c. administration of vigabatrin (GABA transaminase inhibitor, 200 μg/rat) or tiagabine (GABA reuptake inhibitor, 100 μg/rat). These results demonstrate that the activation of central GABA receptors either directly via baclofen or indirectly following interventions that boost GABA levels in central synapses counterbalances the rectifying action of CSA on .© 2018 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29458051>Elevated systemic zonula occludens 1 is positively correlated with inflammation in cirrhosis.</a></h1><p>It has been well established that disruption of the intestinal barrier function and increased intestinal permeability contribute to  and associated liver injury in patients with cirrhosis. However, the relationship between systemic inflammation and tight junction protein in cirrhosis remain unidentified. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the blood concentrations of ZO-1 with systemic hsCRP in patients with cirrhosis and healthy individuals.30 cirrhotic patients and 30 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. Blood ZO-1 and hsCRP were measured by ELISA and biochemical parameters by AU680 Beckman Coulter (USA) autoanalyser.The serum ALT, AST, bilirubin, gamma GT, ALP and ammonia were significantly (P < 0.0001) elevated whilst serum albumin concentration was decreased in cirrhotic patients when compared to healthy individuals. Systemic tight junction protein ZO-1 concentration [590.0 ± 32.79 vs. 349.9 ± 18.76 pg/ml, respectively; P < 0.0001] and hsCRP [10.50 ± 1.05 vs .31 ± 0.65 mg/L, respectively; P < 0.001] were significantly elevated in patients with cirrhosis compared to controls. Significant positive correlation was found between increased ZO-1 and hsCRP (r = 0.2680 P < 0.01).Our results suggested that increased systemic ZO-1 concentration was associated with inflammation in cirrhosis. Thus, elevated blood ZO-1 levels could be a prognostic marker of cirrhotic patients with intestinal TJ disruption on the background of inflammation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The current paradigm suggests that neonatal susceptibility to infection is explained by an innate immune response that is functionally immature. Recent studies in adults have questioned a therapeutic role for IFNβ in sepsis; however, the role of IFNβ in mediating neonatal sensitivity to sepsis is unknown. We evaluated the transcriptional regulation and expression of IFNβ in early neonatal (P0) and adult murine models of  (IP LPS,  mg/kg). We found that hepatic, pulmonary, and serum IFNβ expression was significantly attenuated in endotoxemic neonates when compared to similarly exposed adults. Furthermore,  induced hepatic p65/NFκB and IRF3 activation exclusively in adults. In contrast,  induced immunotolerant p50/NFκB signaling in neonatal mice without evidence of IRF3 activation. Consistent with impaired IFNβ expression and attenuated circulating serum levels, neonatal pulmonary STAT1 signaling and target gene expression was significantly lower than adult levels. Using multiple  approaches, the source of hepatic IFNβ expression in endotoxemic adult mice was determined to be the hepatic macrophage, and experiments in RAW 264.7 cells confirmed that LPS-induced IFNβ expression was NFκB dependent. Finally, treating neonatal mice with IFNβ 2 h after  stimulated pulmonary STAT1 signaling and STAT1 dependent gene expression. Furthermore, IFNβ treatment of endotoxemic neonatal animals resulted in significantly improved survival following exposure to lethal . In conclusion,  induced IFNβ expression is attenuated in the early neonatal period, secondary to impaired NFκB-p65/IRF3 signaling. Pre-treatment with IFNβ decreases neonatal sensitivity to .

Human models that mirror sepsis immunology are instrumental to this aim. The response to endotoxin in humans during the first 24 h captures many hallmarks of the inflammatory response observed in sepsis. However, the long-term immunologic effects of human experimental  have been sparsely studied and could be determinant for the use of this model in sepsis therapy research. In the present work, we studied the immune-composition of healthy subjects challenged with endotoxin (1 ng/kg) 4 h, 2 days, and 20 days post administration by flow cytometry to study the effects on innate and adaptive immune system, and compared it with the immune-composition in patients during the first 9 days after onset of septic shock. We found several differences and similarities between these groups. Experimental  resulted in an increase in absolute numbers of intermediate monocytes, which also displayed lower human leucocyte antigen expression 20 days post endotoxin. These changes differed with those observed in septic shock patients. Another long-term effect of experimental  was elevated numbers of effector CD8 cells and an increased percentage of proliferating and cytokine expressing CD8 cells, and these phenomena were also present in sepsis patients. In conclusion, despite considerable differences, experimental  captures several long-term aspects of sepsis immunology, specifically the behavior of CD8 T cells, which may eventually aid the development of new therapies for sepsis patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605364>Evaluation of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin as a Predictor of Glomerular Filtration Rate and Amikacin Clearance During Early Rat : Comparison with Traditional Endogenous and Exogenous Biomarkers.</a></h1><p>Renal elimination of amikacin and other aminoglycosides is slowed down in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury increasing the risk of adverse effects. Since neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and aminoglycosides share the mechanisms for renal excretion, the predictive power of NGAL was examined towards the changes in amikacin pharmacokinetics during early  in anesthetized Wistar rats.Endogenous biomarkers of inflammation and acute kidney injury were assessed including NGAL in saline-injected controls and two groups of rats challenged with an intravenous injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( mg/kg)-a fluid-resuscitated group (LPS) and a fluid-resuscitated group infused intravenously with 8 μg/kg/h terlipressin (LPS-T). Sinistrin and amikacin were infused to measure glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and amikacin clearance (CL). The investigations included blood gas analysis, chemistry and hematology tests and assessment of urine output, creatinine clearance (CL) and sinistrin clearance (CL).Within 3 h of injection, systemic and renal inflammatory responses were induced by lipopolysaccharide. Gene and protein expression of NGAL was increased in the kidneys and the concentrations of NGAL in the plasma (pNGAL) and urine rose 4- to 38-fold (P < 0.01). The decreases in CL and the GFR markers (CL, CL) were proportional, reflecting the extent to which  impaired the major elimination mechanism for the drug. Terlipressin attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced renal dysfunction (urine output, CL, CL) and accelerated CL. The pNGAL showed a strong association with the CL (rs = - 0.77, P < 0.0005). Concerning prediction of CL, pNGAL was comparable to CL (mean error - 24%) and inferior to CL (mean error - 6.4%), while the measurement of NGAL in urine gave unsatisfactory results.During early  in the rat, pNGAL has a moderate predictive ability towards CL.

Recent reports denoted their redox-modulating and anti-inflammatory activities in experimental . However, their potential nephroprotective effect against endotoxemic kidney injury is yet to be elucidated. This study investigated the possible renoprotective effect of telluric acid (TEL) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in mice, targeting toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) pathways as possible mechanistic contributors to TEL's effect. AKI was induced by LPS (2 mg/kg). TEL (60 μg/kg; i.p.) was administered once daily for seven consecutive days before LPS injection. Pretreatment with TEL alleviated LPS-induced AKI as evidenced by the hampered serum levels of creatinine and cystatin C. TEL also opposed LPS-induced elevation in renal kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, nuclear factor-kappa B p65, interleukin-1β, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance contents. This was accompanied by a replenishment of renal glutathione, transcriptional upregulation of Nrf2, enhancement of heme oxygenase-1 activity, and a marked upregulation of phospho-PI3K and phospho-Akt protein expressions. Histopathological findings corroborated with the amendment of biochemical parameters. In view of these findings, we may conclude that TEL pretreatment purveyed novel nephroprotective effects against endotoxemic kidney injury, which might be partly attributed to the modulation of TLR4, PI3K/Akt, and Nrf2 signaling pathways and may hence provide a valuable asset for the management of endotoxemic renal complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28600357>The natural phosphoinositide derivative glycerophosphoinositol inhibits the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory and thrombotic responses.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory responses are elicited through lipid products of phospholipase A activity that acts on the membrane phospholipids, including the phosphoinositides, to form the proinflammatory arachidonic acid and, in parallel, the glycerophosphoinositols. Here, we investigate the role of the glycerophosphoinositol in the inflammatory response. We show that it is part of a negative feedback loop that limits proinflammatory and prothrombotic responses in human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. This inhibition is exerted both on the signaling cascade initiated by the lipopolysaccharide with the glycerophosphoinositol-dependent decrease in IκB kinase α/β, p38, JNK, and Erk1/2 kinase phosphorylation and at the nuclear level with decreased NF-κB translocation and binding to inflammatory gene promoters. In a model of  in the mouse, treatment with glycerophosphoinositol reduced TNF-α synthesis, which supports the concept that glycerophosphoinositol inhibits the  synthesis of proinflammatory and prothrombotic compounds and might thus have a role as an endogenous mediator in the resolution of inflammation.

In the present study, we modeled SAE by administering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally to mice at a concentration of 3.0 mg/kg. We investigated regional preferences for cytokine-mediated brain reactions to  and at what time point brain inflammation begins, as well as what cytokines are involved in acute brain reactions. Brains were divided into seven parts: cortex (CTX), olfactory system (Olf), hippocampus (Hip), striatum (Str), diencephalon (Die), brain stem (BS), and cerebellum (CBL). In each brain region, we determined the tissue concentrations of 11 cytokines: CCL2, CCL3, CCL11, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, G-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, in mice injected with LPS or saline, at 1, 4, and 24 h after injection using multiplex cytokine assays. Every brain region responded with the production of multiple cytokines to LPS-induced systemic inflammation during the acute phase (4-24 h) after LPS injection. IL-6, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL9, and TNF-α were "early cytokines" that increased only at 4 h but not at 24 h after LPS injection in most brain regions. CCL11, CXCL10, and G-CSF were "late cytokines" that were elevated up to 24 h after LPS injection in selected brain regions. The regions Olf, Hip, and Die were the most responsive to ; these regions produced ten cytokines and continued to produce three "late cytokines" up to 24 h after LPS injection. Str was the least responsive to . The widespread nature of brain cytokine production explains the characteristics of SAE. Further studies on the roles of CCL11, CXCL10, and G-CSF may be especially important in terms of potential prevention of SAE between 4 and 24 h after the onset of sepsis.Copyright © 2019.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of RIC on septic cardiomyopathy and associated multi-organ failure in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis mouse model. Balb/c mice were divided into sham, LPS, and LPS + RIC groups. LPS 10 mg/kg or saline control was injected intraperitoneally. RIC was performed by four cycles of  min ischemia and  min reperfusion of the left lower limb just before the LPS injection. Cardiac function on echocardiography, circulating mediators, blood biochemistry, and MAPK signalling was assessed. Survival 7 days after LPS injection was evaluated in sham-treated, RIC, and daily repeated RIC groups. An LPS-induced decrease in cardiac output was ameliorated by RIC with preserved left ventricular systolic function. LPS-induced increases in TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) were significantly suppressed by RIC. RIC also suppressed increases in plasma cardiac troponin I, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine with suppressed ERK and JNK phosphorylation in heart, liver, and kidney tissue. RIC significantly improved survival rate (p = 0.0037). Survival rate in the daily repeated RIC group was 100%, and it was higher than that in the RIC group (p = 0.0088). In summary, RIC reduced circulating and myocardial inflammatory mediators associated with septic cardiomyopathy, and led to improved ventricular function, cardiac output, and survival. Our data also revealed that chronic RIC has additional benefit in terms of mortality in sepsis.

In a randomised cross-over trial, healthy participants aged 20-25 and 60-75 years ( = 15/group) consumed a high-fat breakfast and a low-fat breakfast. Plasma taken at baseline and post-meal for  h was analysed for circulating endotoxin, cytokines (monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), and inflammatory gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Older subjects had lower baseline PBMC expression of Glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX-1) but greater insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) and circulating MCP-1 compared to younger subjects. After either meal, there were no age differences in plasma, chylomicron endotoxin, or plasma LBP concentrations, nor in inflammatory cytokine gene and protein expression (MCP-1, IL-1β, and TNF-α). Unlike younger participants, the older group had decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD)-2 expression after the meals. After a high-fat meal, older adults have no increased inflammatory or endotoxin response, but an altered oxidative stress gene response compared with younger adults.

The main idea is that there is a common pathway from wellbeing and health to chronic disease ("chronopathy") and even to death, which comprises following steps: 1) unhealthy diet, sedentary life style and permanent exposition to xenobiotics and all kinds of noxious stimuli;→2) intestinal dysbiosis;→3) alteration of the intestinal mucus layer (especially that of the colon);→4) disruption of the endothelial tight junctions;→) metabolic +bacterial translocation;→6) inflammation;→7) exacerbation of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and consequent maladaptation and malfunctioning of the colon;→8) epigenetic manifestations;→9) "chronopathy" and premature death. Therefore, in order to maintain a good health or to improve or even reverse chronic diseases in a person, the main outcome to look for is a homeostatic balance of the intestinal microbiota (eubiosis), most of which is located in the colon. Lynn Margulis was one of the main scientists to highlight the importance of the role played by bacteria not only in the origin of all biological species now present on earth, but also on their role in global homeostasis. Bacteria do not rely on other living beings for their existence, while the latter depend completely on the former. Humans are no exemption, and new evidence emerges each day about the pivotal role of intestinal microbiota in human health, disease and, in general, in its wellbeing. The following facts about intestinal microbiota are nowadays generally accepted: there are about 10 times more bacteria in the gut than human cells in every human being; the microbioma is about 100-150 times bigger that the human genome, and there is a clear link between intestinal microbiota and many of the most common chronic diseases, from obesity and diabetes to depression and Parkinson disease and different kinds of cancer. The main implication of this theory is that we should become a sort of microbiota farmers, that is, we ought to be more conscious of our intestinal microbiota, take care of it and monitor it permanently. Thus, as part of our good life habits (healthy eating, physical exercise), we should probably undergo periodic seasons of fasting and colon cleansing, as it was common in older times.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that PBP10, a synthetic rhodamine B-conjugated peptide, based on the phosphoinositide-binding site of pGSN, exerts bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, interacts specifically with LPS and LTA, and limits microbial-induced inflammatory effects. The therapeutic efficiency of PBP10 when immobilized on the surface of iron oxide-based magnetic nanoparticles was not evaluated, to date.Using the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT stimulated by bacterially-derived LPS and LTA as an in vitro model of bacterial infection, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of nanosystems consisting of iron oxide-based magnetic nanoparticles with aminosilane (MNP@NH) or gold shells (MNP@Au) functionalized by a set of peptides, derived from the phosphatidylinositol 4,-bisphosphate (PIP2)-binding site of the human plasma protein gelsolin, which also binds LPS and LTA. Our results indicate that these nanosystems can kill both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and limit the production of inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in the response to heat-killed microbes or extracted bacterial cell wall components. The nanoparticles possess the potential to improve therapeutic efficacy and are characterized by lower toxicity and improved hemocompatibility when compared to free peptides. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that these PBP10-based nanosystems prevented changes in nanomechanical properties of cells that were otherwise stimulated by LPS.Neutralization of -mediated cellular effects by gelsolin-derived peptides and PBP10-containing nanosystems might be considered as potent therapeutic agents in the improved therapy of bacterial infections and microbial-induced inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29767743>Premeal Low-Fat Yogurt Consumption Reduces Postprandial Inflammation and Markers of Endotoxin Exposure in Healthy Premenopausal Women in a Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h1><p>Metabolic  is associated with obesity and contributes to postprandial inflammation.We aimed to determine if low-fat yogurt consumption prevents postprandial inflammation and dysmetabolism in healthy women by inhibiting biomarkers of metabolic .Premenopausal women defined as obese and nonobese [body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2) 30-40 and 18.-27, respectively, n = 120] were randomly assigned to consume 339 g of low-fat yogurt (YN, yogurt nonobese; YO, yogurt obese) or 324 g of soy pudding (CN, control nonobese; CO, control obese) for 9 wk (n = 30/group).

We found that spore-based probiotic supplementation was associated with a 42% reduction in endotoxin (12.9 ± 3.  6.1 ± 2.6,  = 0.011) and 24% reduction in triglyceride (212 ± 28  138 ± 12,  = 0.004) in the post-prandial period Placebo subjects presented with a 36% increase in endotoxin (10.3 ± 3.4  15.4 ± 4.1,  = 0.011) and % decrease in triglycerides (191 ± 24  186 ± 28,  = 0.004) over the same post-prandial period. We also found that spore-based probiotic supplementation was associated with significant post-prandial reductions in IL-12p70 (24.3 ± 2.2  21. ± 1.7,  = 0.017) and IL-1β (1.9 ± 0.2  1.6 ± 0.1,  = 0.020).

Regional inflammation and blood volume were estimated from 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography.Spatial heterogeneity of aeration and strain increased only in supine lungs (P < 0.001), with higher strains and atelectasis than prone at 24 hours. Absolute strains were lower than those considered globally injurious. Strains redistributed to higher aeration areas as lung injury progressed in supine lungs. At 24 hours, tissue-normalized F-FDG uptake increased more in atelectatic and moderately high-aeration regions (>70%) than in normally aerated regions (P < 0.01), with differential mechanistically relevant regional gene expression. F-FDG phosphorylation rate was associated with strain and blood volume. Imaging findings were confirmed in ventilated patients with sepsis.Mechanical ventilation consistent with clinical practice did not generate excessive regional strain in heterogeneously aerated supine lungs. However, it allowed worsening of spatial strain distribution in these lungs, associated with increased inflammation. Our results support the implementation of early aeration homogenization in normal lungs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550901>Protective effect of hemopexin on systemic inflammation and acute lung injury in an  model.</a></h1><p>Hemopexin (HPX) has been identified as an anti-inflammatory agent, but its role in  is unclear.

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is responsible for LPS-associated immune response and is expressed on numerous immune cells including B lymphocytes. TLR4 is expressed in a functional form on mouse B lymphocytes, a species much less susceptible to  compared with humans who are highly sensitive to endotoxin. Humans possess B lymphocytes that are not responsive to LPS. Likewise, horses are highly susceptible to  but the expression and function of TLR4 on horse B lymphocytes is not known. Colic, the major cause of mortality in horses, is often complicated by resultant . The objective of this study was to determine the expression and function of TLR4 on equine B lymphocytes. Lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells that were collected from six horses, and the expression and function of TLR4 was analyzed for each horse. Flow cytometry results indicate TLR4 is expressed on horse B lymphocytes but stimulation with LPS did not alter this expression (P = 0.99) compared with unstimulated B lymphocytes after 24 h. After 72 h of in vitro LPS stimulation, analysis of cell proliferation dye by flow cytometry demonstrated that equine B lymphocytes did not proliferate, while mouse B lymphocytes predictably did. Furthermore, the total number of LPS stimulated equine B lymphocytes did not significantly differ from unstimulated cells after 72 h of culture (P = 0.92). Horse lymphocytes exhibited no significant differences in the measured TLR4 signaling pathway genes (TLR4, IL-10, IL-6, IFNβ, and TNFα) when expression was compared with LPS stimulated vs. unstimulated cells. In conclusion, while TLR4 is expressed on horse B lymphocytes, it appears minimally responsive to LPS in vitro, similar to results seen in human B lymphocytes. While further studies are still needed, our work reveals a potential link between B lymphocyte TLR4 expression and endotoxin sensitivity.© The Author(s) 2019.

Yet, it is mostly assessed with histograms or large regions-of-interest. Spatial heterogeneity could also influence regional gene expression. We used positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to assess the contribution of different length-scales to mechanical heterogeneity and to direct lung injury biological pathway identification.Sheep exposed to mild (n = , supine and n = 3, prone) and moderate (n = 6, supine) systemic  were protectively ventilated. At baseline, 6 hours and 20 hours length-scale analysis was applied to aeration in CT (mild groups) and PET transmission (moderate group) scans; and voxel-level strain derived from image registration of end-inspiratory and end-expiratory CTs (mild). 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose (F-FDG)-PET kinetics parameters in ventral and dorsal regions were correlated with tissue microarray gene expression (moderate).While aeration and strain heterogeneity were highest at -10 mm length-scales, larger length-scales contained a higher fraction of strain than aeration heterogeneity. Contributions of length-scales >-10 mm to aeration and strain heterogeneity increased as lung injury progressed (p < 0.001) and were higher in supine than prone animals. Genes expressed with regional correlation to F-FDG-PET kinetics (|r| = 0.81 [0.78-0.85]) yielded pathways associated with immune system activation and fluid clearance.Normal spatial heterogeneity of aeration and strain suggest larger anatomical and functional determinants of lung strain than aeration heterogeneity. Lung injury and supine position increase the contribution of larger length-scales. FFDG-PET-based categorization of gene expression results in known and novel biological pathways relevant to lung injury.Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.

Here, we investigated the impact of Rac1 signaling on liver-mediated immune homeostasis.We employed a constitutive Alb-Cre-driven rac1 knock-out and a poly I:C-inducible Mx1-Cre-based knock-out model and analyzed cytokine expression profiles in liver and other organs under basal situation and following LPS-induced  by flow cytometry, qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry.Constitutive Alb-Cre-driven rac1 knockout in hepatocytes altered the basal distribution and activation of immune cells in the liver and likewise in kidney and lung. Early systemic alterations in cytokine serum levels following LPS treatment remained unaffected by Rac1. Furthermore, lack of Rac1 in hepatocytes of untreated animals shifted the liver to a chronic inflammatory state, as depicted by an enhanced mRNA expression of marker genes related to activated macrophages. Upon acute LPS-induced , increased IL-10 mRNA expression in the liver of Alb-Cre Rac1-deficient mice provided an anti-inflammatory response. Employing a poly I:C-inducible Mx1-Cre-based rac1 knock-out, which allows a more widespread rac1 deletion in both hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes, we observed substantial differences regarding both basal and LPS-stimulated cytokine expression profiles as compared to the Alb-Cre system.Rac1-dependent mechanisms in hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes contribute to the maintenance of liver immune homeostasis under basal situation and following LPS-induced . Disturbed Rac1-regulated hepatocyte functions may promote liver damage under pathophysiological situation involving inflammatory stress.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we aimed to analyse the effects of polyphenolic extracts from five types of Arctic berries in a model of diet-induced obesity.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet and orally treated with extracts of bog blueberry (BBE), cloudberry (CLE), crowberry (CRE), alpine bearberry (ABE), lingonberry (LGE) or vehicle (HFHS) for 8 weeks. An additional group of standard-chow-fed, vehicle-treated mice was included as a reference control for diet-induced obesity. OGTTs and insulin tolerance tests were conducted, and both plasma insulin and C-peptide were assessed throughout the OGTT. Quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and ELISAs were used to assess enterohepatic immunometabolic features. Faecal DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA gene-based analysis was used to profile the gut microbiota.Treatment with CLE, ABE and LGE, but not with BBE or CRE, prevented both fasting hyperinsulinaemia (mean ± SEM [pmol/l]: chow 67.2 ± 12.3, HFHS 153.9 ± 19.3, BBE 114.4 ± 14.3, CLE 82. ± 13.0, CRE 152.3 ± 24.4, ABE 90.6 ± 18.0, LGE 95.4 ± 10.) and postprandial hyperinsulinaemia (mean ± SEM AUC [pmol/l × min]: chow 14.3 ± 1.4, HFHS 31.4 ± 3.1, BBE 27.2 ± 4.0, CLE 17.7 ± 2.2, CRE 32.6 ± 6.3, ABE 22.7 ± 18.0, LGE 23.9 ± 2.). None of the berry extracts affected C-peptide levels or body weight gain. Levels of hepatic serine phosphorylated Akt were 1.6-, 1.- and 1.2-fold higher with CLE, ABE and LGE treatment, respectively, and hepatic carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM)-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was 0.6-, 0.7- and 0.9-fold increased in these mice vs vehicle-treated, HFHS-fed mice. These changes were associated with reduced liver triacylglycerol deposition, lower circulating endotoxins, alleviated hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and major gut microbial alterations (e.g. bloom of Akkermansia muciniphila, Turicibacter and Oscillibacter) in CLE-, ABE- and LGE-treated mice.Our findings reveal novel mechanisms by which polyphenolic extracts from ABE, LGE and especially CLE target the gut-liver axis to protect diet-induced obese mice against metabolic , insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, which importantly improves hepatic insulin clearance. These results support the potential benefits of these Arctic berries and their integration into health programmes to help attenuate obesity-related chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders.All raw sequences have been deposited in the public European Nucleotide Archive server under accession number PRJEB19783 ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB19783 ).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28237874>Interleukin-37 suppresses the inflammatory response to protect cardiac function in old endotoxemic mice.</a></h1><p>Myocardial inflammatory responses to  are enhanced in old mice, which results in worse cardiac dysfunction. Anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-37 has a broad effect on innate immunoresponses. We hypothesized that IL-37 suppresses myocardial inflammatory responses to protect cardiac function during  in old mice. Old (20-24month) wild-type (WT), and IL-37 transgenic (IL-37tg) mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.5mg/kg, iv) or normal saline (0.1ml/mouse, iv). Six hours later, left ventricle (LV) function was assessed using a pressure-volume microcatheter. Levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 in plasma and myocardial tissue, as well as mononuclear cell density in the myocardium, were examined. Cardiac microvascular endothelial cells isolated from WT and IL-37tg mice were treated with LPS (0.2µg/ml) for 0.-24h. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 phosphorylation was examined by immunoblotting, and MCP-1 levels in cell culture supernatant was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. LV dysfunction in old WT endotoxemic mice was accompanied by up-regulated MCP-1, myocardial accumulation of mononuclear cells and production of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Expression of IL-37 suppressed myocardial inflammatory responses to  in old mice, resulting in improved LV function. Treatment of old WT endotoxemic mice with recombinant IL-37 also improved LV function. In vitro experiments revealed that cardiac microvascular endothelial cells from IL-37tg mice had attenuated NF-κB activation and MCP-1 production following LPS stimulation. In conclusion, IL-37 is potent to suppress myocardial inflammation and protects against cardiac dysfunction during  in old mice.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Fecal dysbiosis, characterized by an overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in autochthonous non-pathogenic bacteria, becomes prominent with the progression of liver cirrhosis. In cirrhotic patients, disruption of the intestinal barrier causes intestinal hyperpermeability (i.e. leaky gut), which is closely related to gut dysmotility, dysbiosis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and may induce pathological bacterial translocation. Although the involved microbial taxa are somewhat different between the cirrhotic patients from the East and the West, the common manifestation of a shortage of bacteria that contribute to the production of short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids may facilitate intestinal inflammation, leaky gut and gut dysbiosis. Translocated endotoxin and bacterial DNA are capable of provoking potent inflammation and affecting the metabolic and hemodynamic systems, which may ultimately enhance the progression of liver cirrhosis and its various complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE), variceal bleeding, infection and renal disturbances. Among studies on the microbiome-based therapeutics, findings of probiotic effects on HE have been contradictory in spite of several supportive results. However, the effects of synbiotics and prebiotics are substantially documented. The background of their effectiveness should be evaluated again in relation to the cirrhosis-related changes in gut microbiome and their metabolic effects. Strict indications for the antibiotic rifaximin remain unestablished, although its effect is promising, improving HE and other complications with little influence on microbial populations. The final goal of microbiome-based therapeutics is to adjust the gut-liver axis to the maximal benefit of cirrhotic patients, with the aid of evolving metagenomic and metabolomic analyses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28923774>Endotoxin adsorption: Direct hemoperfusion with the polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column (PMX).</a></h1><p>Toraymyxin is a medical device developed to adsorb circulating endotoxins in the blood using direct hemoperfusion therapy for patients with septic shock.

It has been shown that levosimendan has protective effects against tissue injury caused by endotoxin. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of levosimendan on consumptive coagulopathy and organ dysfunction in an endotoxemic animal model induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).Forty-six male adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: 1) control group (n = 10), an intravenous infusion of % dextrose 1.2 mL/kg for 20 min and 0.03 mL/kg/min for 4 h; 2) the levosimendan-treated control group (n = 12), an intravenous levosimendan infusion (24 μg/kg for 20 min plus 0.6 μg/kg/min for 4 h); 3) the LPS group (n = 12), an intravenous LPS (4 mg/kg) infusion followed by dextrose administration; and 4) the levosimendan-treated LPS group (n = 12), an intravenous LPS infusion followed by levosimendan treatment. Various parameters of hemodynamics, biochemistry, hemostasis and inflammatory response were examined during the experimental period.The administration of levosimendan significantly attenuated (i) consumptive coagulopathy displayed by thromboelastography, (ii) the decreases of platelet count and plasma fibrinogen level, (iii) injury in the lung, liver and kidney, and (iv) the rise in plasma interleukin-6 in rats treated with LPS.The treatment of LPS rats with levosimendan was found to reduce organ injury and coagulopathy.

This study aimed to determine the effects of carbohydrate and protein intake during EHS on gastrointestinal integrity, symptoms, and systemic responses. Eleven (male, n = 6; female, n = ) endurance runners completed 2 h of running at 60% maximal oxygen uptake in 35 °C ambient temperature on 3 occasions in randomised order, consuming water (WATER), 15 g glucose (GLUC), or energy-matched whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) before and every 20 min during EHS. Rectal temperature and gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded every 10 min during EHS. Blood was collected pre- and post-EHS, and during recovery to determine plasma concentrations of intestinal fatty-acid binding protein (I-FABP) as a marker of intestinal epithelial injury, cortisol, endotoxin, and inflammatory cytokines. Urinary lactulose/l-rhamnose ratio was used to measure small intestine permeability. Compared with WATER, GLUC, and WPH ameliorated EHS associated intestinal epithelial injury (I-FABP: 897 ± 478 pg·mL vs. 123 ± 197 pg·mL and 82 ± 156 pg·mL, respectively, p < 0.001) and small intestine permeability (lactulose/l-rhamnose ratio: 0.034 ± 0.014 vs. 0.017 ± 0.005 and 0.008 ± 0.002, respectively, p = 0.001).  was observed post-EHS in all trials (10.2 pg·mL, p = 0.001). Post-EHS anti-endotoxin antibodies were higher (p < 0.01) and cortisol and interleukin-6 lower (p < 0.05) on GLUC than WATER only. Total and upper gastrointestinal symptoms were greater on WPH, compared with GLUC and WATER (p < 0.05), in response to EHS. In conclusion, carbohydrate and protein intake during EHS ameliorates intestinal injury and permeability. Carbohydrate also supports endotoxin clearance and reduces stress markers, while protein appears to increase gastrointestinal symptoms, suggesting that carbohydrate is a more appropriate option.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709962>The role of macrophages in the development of biliary injury in a lipopolysaccharide-aggravated hepatic ischaemia-reperfusion model.</a></h1><p>Endotoxins, in the form of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), are potent inducers of biliary injury. However the mechanism by which injury develops remains unclear. We hypothesized that hepatic macrophages are pivotal in the development of endotoxin-induced biliary injury and that no injury would occur in their absence.Clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages from the liver. Forty-eight rats were equally divided across six study groups: sham operation (sham), liposome treatment and sham operation (liposomes+sham), 1mg/kg LPS i.p. (LPS), liposome treatment and LPS administration (liposomes+LPS), hepatic ischaemia-reperfusion injury with LPS administration (IRI+LPS) and liposome treatment followed by IRI+LPS (liposomes+IRI+LPS). Following 6h of reperfusion, blood, bile, and liver tissue was collected for further analysis. Small bile duct injury was assessed, serum liver tests were performed and bile composition was evaluated. The permeability of the blood-biliary barrier (BBB) was assessed using intravenously administered horseradish peroxidase (HRP).The presence of hepatic macrophages was reduced by 90% in LPS and IRI+LPS groups pre-treated with clodronate liposomes (P<0.001). Severe small bile duct injury was not affected by macrophage depletion, and persisted in the liposomes+IRI+LPS group (50% of animals) and liposomes+LPS group (75% of animals). Likewise, BBB impairment persisted following macrophage depletion. LPS-induced elevation of the chemokine Mcp-1 in bile was not affected by macrophage depletion.Depletion of hepatic macrophages did not prevent development of biliary injury following LPS or LPS-enhanced IRI. Cholangiocyte activation rather than macrophage activation may underlie this injury.

During sepsis, the dysregulated systemic inflammatory response to infection, iron homeostasis becomes disrupted, generating an excess of ROS causing damage to tissues. This can be potentially suppressed using iron chelators that selectively bind iron to prevent its participation in ROS-related inflammatory reactions.We hypothesize that administration of DIBI, a novel iron-chelator, attenuates the dysregulated systemic immune response and reduces tissue damage in experimental .Five groups of animals (n = -10) were included in this study: control, untreated , and  animals treated with either DIBI-A, MAHMP, or DIBI-B.

We hypothesized that natriuretic peptides prevent lipopolysaccharide-induced oliguria by activating guanylyl cyclase A, a receptor for natriuretic peptides, in proximal tubules and endothelial cells.Normal Sprague-Dawley rats and mice lacking guanylyl cyclase A in either endothelial cells or proximal tubular cells were challenged with lipopolysaccharide and assessed for oliguria and intratubular flow rate by intravital imaging with multiphoton microscopy.Recombinant atrial natriuretic peptide efficiently improved urine volume without changing blood pressure after lipopolysaccharide challenge in rats (urine volume at 4 h, lipopolysaccharide: 0.6 ± 0.3 ml · kg · h; lipopolysaccharide + fluid resuscitation: 4.6 ± 2.0 ml · kg · h; lipopolysaccharide + fluid resuscitation + atrial natriuretic peptide: 9.0 ± 4.8 ml · kg · h; mean ± SD; n =  per group). Lipopolysaccharide decreased glomerular filtration rate and slowed intraproximal tubular flow rate, as measured by in vivo imaging. Fluid resuscitation restored glomerular filtration rate but not tubular flow rate. Adding atrial natriuretic peptide to fluid resuscitation improved both glomerular filtration rate and tubular flow rate. Mice lacking guanylyl cyclase A in either proximal tubules or endothelium demonstrated less improvement of tubular flow rate when treated with atrial natriuretic peptide, compared with control mice. Deletion of endothelial, but not proximal tubular, guanylyl cyclase A augmented the reduction of glomerular filtration rate by lipopolysaccharide.Both endogenous and exogenous natriuretic peptides prevent lipopolysaccharide-induced oliguria by activating guanylyl cyclase A in proximal tubules and endothelial cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30009813>Additive counteraction by α7 and α4β2-nAChRs of the hypotension and cardiac sympathovagal imbalance evoked by  in male rats.</a></h1><p>The cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway favorably influences end organ damage induced by inflammatory conditions.

We assessed dose-effect relationships of i.v. nicotine (25, 50, or 100 μg/kg), PHA-543613 (α7-nAChR agonist; 0.2 or 2.0 mg/kg), or -iodo-A-85380 (5IA, α4β2-nAChRs agonist; 0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg) on cardiovascular and inflammatory responses elicited by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg i.v.). The two lower doses of nicotine caused dose-dependent attenuation of hypotensive and tachycardic responses of LPS. Nicotine also reversed LPS-evoked reductions in time-domain indices of heart rate variability (HRV) and spectral measure of cardiac sympathovagal balance. Alternatively, hypotensive and tachycardic effects of LPS were (i) partly and dose-dependently reversed after selective activation of α7 (PHA) or α4β2-nAChRs (5IA), and (ii) completely eliminated after co-treatment with the smaller doses of the two agonists. Further, PHA or 5IA abolished the reducing effect of LPS on time and spectral measures of HRV.

Although TLR4 stimulation mediated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also upregulates autophagy in hepatocytes and liver, its physiological role remains elusive. The objective of this study was to determine the role of LPS-induced autophagy in the regulation of liver lipid metabolism. LPS treatment ( mg/kg) increased autophagy, as detected by LC3 conversion and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis in C57BL6 mouse livers. AC2F hepatocytes also showed increased autophagic flux after LPS treatment (1 μg/ml). To investigate the role of LPS-induced autophagy further, liver lipid metabolism changes in LPS-treated mice and fasted controls were compared. Interestingly, LPS-treated mice showed less lipid accumulation in liver than fasted mice despite increased fatty acid uptake and lipid synthesis-associated genes. In vitro analysis using AC2F hepatocytes demonstrated LPS-induced autophagy influenced the degradation of lipid droplets. Inhibition of LPS-induced autophagy using bafilomycin A or Atg7 knockdown significantly increased lipid accumulation in AC2F hepatocytes. In addition, pretreatment with chloroquine aggravated LPS-induced lipid accumulation and inflammation in C57BL6 mouse livers. The physiological importance of autophagy was verified in LPS-treated young and aged rats. Autophagic response was diminished in LPS-treated aged rats and lipid metabolism was impaired during sepsis, indicating autophagy response is important for regulating lipid metabolism after endotoxin challenge. Our findings demonstrate endotoxin-induced autophagy is important for the regulation of lipid metabolism, and suggest that autophagy helps maintain lipid metabolism homeostasis during sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738665>Impacts of chronic and increasing lipopolysaccharide exposure on production and reproductive parameters in lactating Holstein dairy cows.</a></h1><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration causes immunoactivation, which negatively affects production and fertility, but experimental exposure via an acute bolus is unlikely to resemble natural infections. Thus, the objectives were to characterize effects of chronic  on production parameters and follicular development in estrous-synchronized lactating cows. Eleven Holstein cows (169 ± 20 d in milk; 681 ± 16 kg of body weight) were acclimated to their environmental surroundings for 3 d and then enrolled in 2 experimental periods (P). During P1 (3 d) cows consumed feed ad libitum and baseline samples were obtained. During P2 (7 d), cows were assigned to continuous infusion of either (1) saline-infused and pair-fed (CON-PF; 40 mL/h of saline i.v.; n = ) or (2) LPS infused and ad libitum fed (LPS-AL; Escherichia coli O55:B5; 0.017, 0.020, 0.026, 0.036, 0.055, 0.088, and 0.148 μg/kg of body weight/h i.v. on d 1 to 7, respectively; n = 6). Controls were pair-fed to the LPS-AL group to eliminate confounding effects of dissimilar nutrient intake. Infusing LPS temporally caused mild hyperthermia on d 1 to 3 (+0.49°C) relative to baseline. Dry matter intake of LPS-AL cows decreased (28%) on d 1 of P2, then progressively returned to baseline. Relative to baseline, milk yield from LPS-AL cows was decreased on d 1 of P2 (12%). No treatment differences were observed in milk yield during P2. Follicular growth, dominant follicle size, serum progesterone (P4), and follicular P4 and 17β-estradiol concentrations were similar between treatments. Serum 17β-estradiol tended to increase (115%) and serum amyloid A and LPS-binding protein were increased (118 and 40%, respectively) in LPS-AL relative to CON-PF cows. Compared with CON-PF, neutrophils in LPS-AL cows were initially increased (45%), then gradually decreased. In contrast, monocytes were initially decreased (40%) and progressively increased with time in the LPS-AL cows. Hepatic mRNA abundance of cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C (CYP2C) or CYP3A was not affected by LPS, nor was there a treatment effect on toll-like receptor 4 or LBP; however, acyloxyacyl hydrolase and RELA subunit of nuclear factor kappa B tended to be increased in LPS-AL cows. These data suggest lactating dairy cows become tolerant to chronic and exponentially increasing LPS infusion in terms of production and reproductive parameters.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Although numerous studies show a strong relationship between the composition of gut microbiota and specific metabolic disorders associated with obesity, the key mechanisms are still being studied. The present review focuses on specific complex pathways as well as key interactions. For instance, the nervous routes are explored by examining the enteric nervous system, the vagus nerve, and the brain, as well as the endocrine routes (i.e., glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY, endocannabinoids) by which gut microbes communicate with the host. Moreover, the key metabolites involved in such specific interactions (e.g., short chain fatty acids, bile acids, neurotransmitters) as well as their targets (i.e., receptors, cell types, and organs) are briefly discussed. Finally, the review highlights the role of metabolic  in the onset of metabolic disorders and the implications for alterations in gut microbiota-host interactions and ultimately the onset of diseases.© 2018 The Authors.

Our earlier study suggested that finger millet (FM) could ameliorate high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic derangements. The present study is aimed to evaluate the effect of FM-AX supplementation, a key bioactive from finger millet, on HFD-induced metabolic and gut bacterial derangements. Male Swiss albino mice were fed with normal chow diet (NPD) or HFD (60%kcal from fat) for 10 weeks. FM-AX was orally supplemented at doses of 0. and 1.0g/kg bodyweight on every alternate day for 10 weeks. Glucose tolerance, serum hormones, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, white adipose tissue marker gene expression, adipocyte size and inflammation; metagenomic alterations in cecal bacteria; cecal short chain fatty acids and colonic tight junction gene expressions were studied. FM-AX supplementation prevented HFD-induced weight gain, alerted glucose tolerance and serum lipid profile, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation. Hepatic and white adipose tissue gene expressions were beneficially modulated. Further, AX supplementation prevented metagenomic alterations in cecum; improved ileal and colonic health and overall prevented metabolic . Present work suggests that AX from finger millet can be developed as a nutraceutical for the management of HFD- induced obesity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Berberine is used to treat obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis. The mechanism underlying the role of berberine in modulating metabolic disorders is not fully clear because berberine has poor oral bioavailability. Thus, we evaluated whether the antiatherosclerotic effect of berberine is related to alterations in gut microbial structure and if so, whether specific bacterial taxa contribute to the beneficial effects of berberine.Apoe mice were fed either a normal-chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD). Berberine was administered to mice in drinking water (0. g/L) for 14 weeks. Gut microbiota profiles were established by high throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. The effects of berberine on metabolic , tissue inflammation and gut barrier integrity were also investigated.Berberine treatment significantly reduced atherosclerosis in HFD-fed mice. Akkermansia spp. abundance was markedly increased in HFD-fed mice treated with berberine. Moreover, berberine decreased HFD-induced metabolic  and lowered arterial and intestinal expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Berberine treatment increased intestinal expression of tight junction proteins and the thickness of the colonic mucus layer, which are related to restoration of gut barrier integrity in HFD-fed mice.Modulation of gut microbiota, specifically an increase in the abundance of Akkermansia, may contribute to the antiatherosclerotic and metabolic protective effects of berberine, which is poorly absorbed orally. Our findings therefore support the therapeutic value of gut microbiota manipulation in treating atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A study was performed to assess the effects of low- to moderate dose (0., 1 or 2ng/kg)  on the endothelium and kidneys as measured by a panel of novel highly sensitive kidney injury markers.This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with single ascending doses of LPS (0., 1 or 2ng/kg) administered to healthy male volunteers (3 cohorts of 8 subjects, LPS:placebo 6:2). Endothelial measures included selectins, cell adhesion molecules, and thrombomodulin. Renal measures included novel, sensitive and specific biomarkers of acute kidney injury.Endotoxin exposure resulted in consistent LPS dose-dependent responses in inflammatory markers, E- and P- Selectin, VCAM1, ICAM1, and thrombomodulin. The observed biological responses were transient, reaching a level of significance of at least <0.01 in the highest dose group and with an effect size which was dependent on the administered LPS dose. LPS-induced inflammatory and endothelial effects did not translate into a change in renal damage biomarkers, although at 2ng/kg LPS, subtle and transient biomarker changes were observed that may relate to (subclinical) tubular damage.We demonstrated that administration of a single LPS dose of 2ng/kg to healthy volunteers results in significant inflammatory and endothelial responses, without inducing clinically relevant signs of kidney injury. These findings support the application of the human  model in future clinical pharmacology studies.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Microdialysis catheters were inserted into the arterial circulation, heart, brain, kidney, and liver to monitor local metabolism. Blood samples were recovered to measure serum inflammatory cytokines, creatinine, troponin, atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and hyaluronan. All animals were monitored and supported for 12 hours after fluid resuscitation.After resuscitation, animals that received fluid resuscitation required significantly more noradrenaline to maintain the same mean arterial pressure in the subsequent 12 hours (68.9 mg vs. 39.6 mg; P = 0.04). Serum cytokines were similar between groups. Atrial natriuretic peptide increased significantly after fluid resuscitation compared with that observed in animals managed without fluid resuscitation (335 ng/ml [256-382] vs. 233 ng/ml [144-292]; P = 0.04). Cross-sectional time-series analysis showed that the rate of increase of the glycocalyx glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan was greater in the fluid-resuscitated group over the course of the study (P = 0.02).Fluid resuscitation resulted in a paradoxical increase in vasopressor requirement. Additionally, it did not result in improvements in any of the measured microcirculatory- or organ-specific markers measured. The increase in vasopressor requirement may have been due to endothelial/glycocalyx damage secondary to atrial natriuretic peptide-mediated glycocalyx shedding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30458048>One-year weight management lowers lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and its implication in metainflammation and liver fibrosis.</a></h1><p>Studies showed that the -related biomarker, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), is associated with obesity and fatty liver. The level of LBP is reduced after surgical weight loss. This study aimed to verify the change of serum LBP levels after one-year medical weight management in subjects with obesity.A total of 62 subjects with obesity, 39 subjects with overweight, and 21 subjects with normal body mass index were enrolled for a one-year weight management program. Basic information, body composition analysis, clinical data, serum LBP level, and abdominal ultrasonography findings were collected. At baseline, the serum LBP levels of the obese and overweight subjects were significantly higher than that of the normal group (30.9±7.4 and 29.6±6.3 versus 23.1±.6 μg/mL, respectively, p<0.001). Serum LBP in subjects with obesity was significantly reduced to 26.±7.1 μg/mL (p-value < 0.001) after one year. In the multivariate analyses, LBP was associated with high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score (NFS) before weight management in the obese group. Moreover, the change of LBP in response to weight management was significantly related to the changes of hs-CRP, leukocyte count and NFS by multivariate linear regression analysis also in the obese group.The serum level of the -related biomarker, LBP, decreases after one-year weight management in the obese subjects. In addition to serving as a metainflammatroy biomarker like hs-CRP, LBP may also be a potential biomarker as a non-invasive biomarker for the evaluation of liver fibrosis in NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428876>Mitochondrial bioenergetics links inflammation and cardiac contractility in .</a></h1><p>There is current awareness about the central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of cardiac dysfunction in systemic inflammatory syndromes, especially in sepsis and . The aim of this work was to elucidate the mechanism that governs the link between the severity of the systemic inflammatory insult and mitochondrial function, analysing the consequences on heart function, particularly in cardiac contractile state. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to low-grade  (i.p. injection LPS 0. mg kg body weight) and severe  (i.p. injection LPS 8 mg kg body weight) for 6 h. Blood NO, as well as cardiac TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA, were found increased as the severity of the  increases. Cardiac relaxation was altered only in severe , although contractile and lusitropic reserves were found impaired in both treatments in response to work-overload. Cardiac ultrastructure showed disorientation of myofibrillar structure in both  degrees, but mitochondrial swelling and cristae disruption were only observed in severe . Mitochondrial ATP production, O consumption and mitochondrial inner membrane potential decreases were related to blood NO levels and mitochondrial protein nitration, leading to diminished ATP availability and impairment of contractile state. Co-treatment with the NOS inhibitor L-NAME or the administration of the NO scavenger c-PTIO leads to the observation that mitochondrial bioenergetics status depends on the degree of the inflammatory insult mainly determined by blood NO levels.

It is known that bone marrow derived macrophages are important in resolving the inflammation and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Here, we hypothesize that treatment in combination of DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi) -Aza 2-deoxycytidine (Aza) and histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) Trichostatin A (TSA) mitigates the inflammation induced pyroptosis and apoptosis during  induced ALI. To test this hypothesis, the mice challenged with a sublethal dose of LPS followed by one-hour post-treatment with a single dose of Aza and TSA intraperitoneally showed a substantial attenuation of apoptosis and inflammation. Importantly, we observed significant changes in the mitochondrial membrane structure, and lower levels of DNA fragmentation, reduced expression of apoptotic and pyroptotic genes both transcriptionally and translationally in LPS induced BMDMs treated by a combination of Aza and TSA than in LPS-induced BMDMs treated with either drug alone. The protection was mediated by an inhibition of JNK-ERK and STAT3-JMJD3 activated pathways. Thus, targeting these important signaling pathways with the combination of Aza and TSA would be a good treatment modality for ALI.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We also examined the association between serum FFAs and LBP in the participants.In this age-matched and gender-matched case-control study, 164 abdominally obese subjects were recruited from June to November 2015 in the northwest of Iran. Demographic data, dietary intake, body composition, anthropometric indices and physical activity (PA) were assessed. Basal blood samples were collected to determine serum metabolic parameters, FFAs and LBP. Abdominal obesity was defined as having waist circumference ≥95 cm. Those with three or more metabolic alterations were defined as MUAO and those having two or less were classified as MHAO. Data were analysed using SPSS V.17.0.There were no significant differences in dietary intake, anthropometric indices, body composition and PA between the two groups. The odds of MUAO significantly increased by increments in serum fasting blood sugar (OR 3.79, 95% CI 2.25 to 6.40), triglycerides (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15), systolic blood pressure (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.04) and diastolic blood pressure (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06) and decreased by increase in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.52). The levels of LBP and FFAs showed no significant differences between the two groups. However, significant correlations were found between LBP and FFAs in pooled population (r=0.712; p<0.001) as well as in cases (r=0.717; p<0.001) and controls (r=0.704; p<0.001). Neither FFAs nor LBP were significantly correlated with dietary intake or metabolic parameters (p>0.05).The results indicated that serum LBP and FFAs are highly correlated both in MHAO and MUAO states. In addition, the levels of LBP and FFAs seem to be more related to abdominal obesity than to the presence or absence of metabolic health.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

Sporadic cases of bacteraemia were found after BAE. Balloon distension by BAE caused gut tissue hypoxia. The impact of balloon distension-induced hypoxia on intestinal barriers remains unclear. Murine models of BAE by colonic balloon distension showed that short- and long-term hypoxia evoked opposite effects on epithelial tight junctions (TJs). Short-term hypoxia fortified TJ integrity, whereas long-term hypoxia caused damage to barrier function. Our data showed for the first time the molecular mechanisms and signalling pathways of epithelial barrier fortification and TJ reorganization by short-term hypoxia for the maintenance of gut homeostasis. The findings suggest avoiding prolonged balloon distension during BAE to reduce the risk of hypoxia-induced gut barrier dysfunction.Balloon-assisted enteroscopy (BAE) is an emerging standard procedure that uses distensible balloons to facilitate deep endoscopy. Intestines are known to harbour an abundant microflora. Whether balloon distension causes perturbation of blood flow and gut barrier dysfunction, and elicits risk of bacterial translocation remains unknown. Our aims were to (1) conduct a prospective study to gather microbiological and molecular evidence of bacterial translocation by BAE in patients, (2) establish a murine model of colonic balloon distension to investigate tissue hypoxia and intestinal barrier, and (3) assess the effect of short- and long-term hypoxia on epithelial permeability using cell lines. Thirteen patients were enrolled for BAE procedures, and blood samples were obtained before and after BAE for paired comparison. Four of the 13 patients (30.8%) had positive bacterial DNA in blood after BAE. Post-BAE  was higher than the pre-BAE level. Nevertheless, no clinical symptom of sepsis or fever was reported. To mimic clinical BAE, mice were subjected to colonic balloon distension. Local tissue hypoxia was observed during balloon inflation, and reoxygenation after deflation. A trend of increased gut permeability was seen after long-term distension, whereas a significant reduction of permeability was observed by short-term distension in the proximal colon. Human colonic epithelial Caco-2 cells exposed to hypoxia for -20 min exhibited increased tight junctional assembly, while those exposed to longer hypoxia displayed barrier disruption. In conclusion, sporadic cases of bacteraemia were found after BAE, without septic symptoms. Short-term hypoxia by balloon distension yielded a protective effect whereas long-term hypoxia caused damage to the gut barrier.© 2017 The Authors.

Increased IM and NCM percentages have been reported under inflammatory conditions, yet little is known about monocyte subsets at the onset of inflammation. The human  model is uniquely capable of studying the first phases of acute inflammation induced by intravenous injection of 2 ng/kg bodyweight lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into healthy volunteers. After that, monocyte subset counts, activation/differentiation status and chemokine levels were studied over 24 h. The numbers of all subsets were decreased by >95% after LPS injection. CM numbers recovered first (3- 6 h), followed by IM (6-8 h) and NCM numbers (8-24 h). Similarly, increased monocyte counts were observed first in CM (8 h), followed by IM and NCM (24 h). Monocytes did not display a clear activated phenotype (minor increase in CD11b and CD38 expression). Plasma levels of CCL2, CCL4 and CX3CL1 closely resembled the cell numbers of CM, IM and NCM, respectively. Our study provides critical insights into the earliest stages of acute inflammation and emphasizes the necessity to stain for different monocyte subsets when studying the role of monocytes in disease, as neither function nor kinetics of the subsets overlap.© 2017 S.

SIRT5 resides mainly in the mitochondria where it catalyzes deacetylation, demalonylation, desuccinylation, and deglutarylation of lysine to regulate metabolic and oxidative stress response pathways. Pharmacologic inhibitors of SIRT5 are under development for oncologic conditions, but nothing is known about the impact of SIRT5 on antimicrobial innate immune defenses. Using SIRT5 knockout mice, we show that SIRT5 deficiency does not affect immune cell development, cytokine production and proliferation by macrophages and splenocytes exposed to microbial and immunological stimuli. Moreover, preclinical models suggest that SIRT5 deficiency does not worsen ,  and  pneumonia,  peritonitis, listeriosis, and staphylococcal infection.

The HFD not only increases intake of saturated fatty acid (SFA) but also induces metabolic , an HFD-associated increase in circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Although it is known that SFA or LPS promote hepatic inflammation, a hallmark of NAFLD, it remains unclear how SFA in combination with LPS stimulates host inflammatory response in hepatocytes. In this study, we performed both in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate the effect of SFA in combination with LPS on proinflammatory gene expression in hepatocytes. Our animal study showed that feeding low-density lipoprotein-deficient mice HFD enriched with SFA and injection of low-dose LPS cooperatively stimulated IL-6 expression in livers. To understand how SFA and LPS interact to promote IL-6 expression, our in vitro studies showed that palmitic acid (PA), a major SFA, and LPS exerted synergistic effect on the expression of IL-6 in hepatocytes. Furthermore, coculture of hepatocytes with macrophages resulted in a greater IL-6 expression than culture of hepatocytes without macrophages in response to the combination of PA and LPS. Finally, we observed that LPS and PA increased ceramide production by cooperatively stimulating ceramide de novo synthesis, which played an essential role in the synergistic stimulation of proinflammatory gene expression by LPS and PA. Taken together, this study showed that SFA in combination with LPS stimulated a strong inflammatory response in hepatocytes in vivo and in vitro.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30885503>Circulating plasma microRNAs dysregulation and metabolic  induced by a high-fat high-saturated diet.</a></h1><p>High-fat diet increase two to three times the plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels and induce subclinical inflammation. Diet can modify gene expression due to epigenetic processes related to MicroRNAs (miRNAs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important role in the post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in regulation of expression of genes related to the inflammatory response. Also, diet can indirectly induce post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by miRNAs, which may affect the risk for the development of chronic diseases.This study investigated the effect of high-fat high-saturated meal ingestion on plasma miRNA expression and LPS levels during the postprandial period in healthy women.An interventional study was carried out in which a high-fat breakfast (1067.45 kcal), composed mainly of saturated fatty acids (56 g), and 500 mL of water, was offered. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 1, 3 and  h after meal intake. The studied population consisted of healthy women (n = 11), aged between 20 and 40 years, and body mass index (BMI) between 18. and 25 kg/m. Plasma levels of lipid profile, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and LPS were measured at the 3 time points. A profile of 752 human plasma miRNA expression was analyzed by real-time PCR assay. These analyzes were performed for all blood collection time-points.Expression profile analysis revealed 33 differentially expressed plasma circulating miRNAs compared to that of the control group. MiR-145-5p and miR-200 were differentially modulated in all time-points post meal consumption. In addition, there was a significant increase in plasma LPS, triglycerides, myristic and palmitic saturated fatty acids levels at the 3 time-points in comparison with the control basal levels. We also observed increased levels of the plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) cytokine and the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) levels after  h post meal ingestion.Ingestion of high-fat high-saturated meal was able to induce metabolic  and increase the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules such as TNF-alpha and VCAM-1, as well as modulating circulating miRNAs possibly controlling inflammatory and lipid metabolism proteins at the postprandial period.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Involuntary loss of skeletal muscle, termed muscle wasting, is commonly observed in these conditions, suggesting that circulating LPS might play an essential role in its development. Although impairment of muscle regeneration is an important determinant of skeletal muscle wasting, it is unclear whether LPS affects this process and, if so, by what mechanism. Here, we used the C2C12 myoblast cell line to investigate the effects of LPS on myogenesis.C2C12 myoblasts were grown to 80% confluence and induced to differentiate in the absence or presence of LPS (0.1 or 1 μg/mL); TAK-242 (1 μM), a specific inhibitor of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling; and a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α neutralizing antibody ( μg/mL). Expression of a skeletal muscle differentiation marker (myosin heavy chain II), two essential myogenic regulatory factors (myogenin and MyoD), and a muscle negative regulatory factor (myostatin) was analyzed by western blotting. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) DNA-binding activity was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.LPS dose-dependently and significantly decreased the formation of multinucleated myotubes and the expression of myosin heavy chain II, myogenin, and MyoD, and increased NF-κB DNA-binding activity and myostatin expression. The inhibitory effect of LPS on myogenic differentiation was reversible, suggesting that it was not caused by nonspecific toxicity. Both TAK-242 and anti-TNF-α reduced the LPS-induced increase in NF-κB DNA-binding activity, downregulation of myogenic regulatory factors, and upregulation of myostatin, thereby partially rescuing the impairment of myogenesis.Our data suggest that LPS inhibits myogenic differentiation via a TLR4-NF-κB-dependent pathway and an autocrine/paracrine TNF-α-induced pathway.

Artery and vein S-nitrosohemoglobin were detected at 2 h. Variables were compared by one-way analysis of variance.Dunnett-3 was used for comparisons between two groups.  Microvascular flow index in Control group and LPS+ NAC group at 2 h were much higher than that in LPS group (2.82±0.09 vs 1.11±0.16, <0.001; 1.60±0.17 vs 1.11±0.16, <0.001), and flow heterogeneity index in Control group and LPS+ NAC group at 2 h were significantly lower than that in LPS group (0.16±0.06 vs 1.16±0.33, <0.001; 0.80±0.12 vs 1.16±0.33, =0.035).

In this context, fructose feeding promotes endotoxin translocation from the gut, contributing to disease progression via an inflammatory process. Citrulline is protective against fructose-induced NAFLD; we hypothesised that this property might be related to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative action against endotoxin-induced hepatic injuries. This hypothesis was evaluated in a model of perfused liver isolated from NAFLD rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n 30) were fed either a standard rodent chow or a 60 % fructose diet alone, or supplemented with citrulline (1 g/kg per d) for 4 weeks. After an evaluation of their metabolic status, fasted rats received an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (2· mg/kg). After 1 h, the livers were isolated and perfused for 1 h to study liver function and metabolism, inflammation and oxidative status. In vivo, citrulline significantly decreased dyslipidaemia induced by a high-fructose diet and insulin resistance. In the isolated perfused rat livers,  resulted in higher cytolysis (alanine aminotransferase release) and higher inflammation (Toll-like receptor 4) in livers of fructose-fed rats, and it was prevented by citrulline supplementation. Oxidative stress and antioxidative defences were similar in all three groups. Amino acid exchanges and metabolism (ammonia and urea release) were only slightly different between the three groups. In this context of mild steatosis, our results suggest that fructose-induced NAFLD leads to an increased hepatic sensitivity to LPS-induced inflammation. Citrulline-induced restriction of the inflammatory process may thus contribute to the prevention of NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28242823>Renal sympathetic nerve activity and vascular reactivity to phenylephrine after lipopolysaccharide administration in conscious rats.</a></h1><p>It has been proposed that sympathoexcitation is responsible for vascular desensitization to -adrenoceptor stimulation during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation. The present study tested this hypothesis by examining the effects of sympatho-deactivation with the -adrenoceptor agonist, dexmedetomidine, on mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), and vascular reactivity to phenylephrine in conscious rats with cardiac autonomic blockade (methylatropine and atenolol) following LPS administration. In male, adult Sprague-Dawley rats (= per group), RSNA and MAP were continuously recorded over 1-h periods, before and after LPS administration (20 mg/kg iv), and finally after infusion of either saline or dexmedetomidine ( g/kg, then  g/kg/h iv). A full doseresponse curve to phenylephrine was constructed under each condition. After pooling data from both groups of rats (=10), LPS significantly (=0.005) decreased MAP (from 115 ± 1 to 107 ± 2 mmHg), increased RSNA (to 403 ± 46% of baseline values) and induced 4 to -fold increases in the half-maximal effective dose (ED) of phenylephrine (from 1.02 ± 0.09 to 4.76 ± 0.51 g/kg). During saline infusion, RSNA progressively decreased while vascular reactivity did not improve. Treatment with dexmedetomidine decreased MAP, returned RSNA to near pre-endotoxemic levels, but only partially restored vascular reactivity to phenylephrine (ED was still threefold increased as compared with baseline values). These findings indicate that only part of the decrease in vascular reactivity to -adrenoceptor stimulation during  can be accounted for by sympathetic activation, at least on a short-term basis.© 2017 The Authors.

Historically thought to result from overnutrition and a sedentary lifestyle, recent evidence suggests that diets high in sugar (from sucrose and/or high-fructose corn syrup [HFCS]) not only increase the risk of NAFLD, but also non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Herein, we review the experimental and clinical evidence that fructose precipitates fat accumulation in the liver, due to both increased lipogenesis and impaired fat oxidation. Recent evidence suggests that the predisposition to fatty liver is linked to the metabolism of fructose by fructokinase C, which results in ATP consumption, nucleotide turnover and uric acid generation that mediate fat accumulation. Alterations to gut permeability, the microbiome, and associated  contribute to the risk of NAFLD and NASH. Early clinical studies suggest that reducing sugary beverages and total fructose intake, especially from added sugars, may have a significant benefit on reducing hepatic fat accumulation. We suggest larger, more definitive trials to determine if lowering sugar/HFCS intake, and/or blocking uric acid generation, may help reduce NAFLD and its downstream complications of cirrhosis and chronic liver disease.Copyright © 2018 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Citrulline (Cit), which has been shown to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in other situations, may be of interest in this setting. Our aim was to assess the effect of Cit in three catabolic models relevant to critical illness:  (LPS), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and TBI with infectious complications (TBI-Ec), which are characterized by different alterations in protein homeostasis. Fifty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-220 g) were randomized to receive a standard diet ad libitum (CON, n = 9) or to undergo catabolic injuries on day 0 (D0, n = 49), and EN (Sondalis HP energy® 290 kcal/kg/d) from day 1 (D1) combined with Cit (2 g/kg/d) or isonitrogenous non-essential AAs (NEAAs) until day 3 (D3).  was induced by IP injection of LPS from E. coli (3 mg/kg), TBI by hydraulic percussion, and infectious complications (TBI-Ec) by administration of luminescent E. coli on D1. Nitrogen balance (ΔN) and 3-methylhistidine (3-MHis) were measured daily. Muscle protein synthesis (MPS, measured by the SUnSET method) and mTORC1 activation (S6K-1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation) were measured on D3 2 h after the arrest of enteral nutrition in soleus, extensor digitorum longus (EDL), gastrocnemius and tibialis muscles. ΔN was lower (p < 0.001) in all three models of injury compared with basal and CON from D1 to D3, and more negative in the LPS-CIT (p < 0.05) than in the LPS group. The 3-MHis/creatinine ratio was significantly increased on D1 in all groups compared with CON, and on D2 only in the LPS and TBI groups (p < 0.0001, LPS and TBI vs. CON). MPS was similar in all groups in soleus and tibialis but significantly higher in EDL in LPS-CIT [LPS-CIT: 4. ± 1.7 (mean ± SD) vs. CON: 2.3 ± 1.2; and vs. LPS-NEAA: 3.1 ± 2.3] and in gastrocnemius (LPS-CIT vs. CON; p = 0.05). S6K-1 phosphorylation in the EDL was also higher in LPS-CIT vs. CON (LPS-CIT: 0.94 ± 0.51 CON: 0.42 ± 0.28), but not in gastrocnemius. IL-6 plasma level was significantly higher in all the catabolic groups vs. CON (p < 0.005) with no difference between treatments (Cit or NEAAs). In conclusion, the TBI model showed only a rise in muscle proteolysis, whereas the LPS model displayed a rise in both protein synthesis and proteolysis. Secondly, our results show that the Cit effect varies according to the type of injury and to the muscle under study. The stimulation of MPS rate and the mTOR pathway in LPS-treated rats contrasts with degraded ΔN, suggesting that the Cit effect on protein metabolism in critically ill rats is limited at the whole-body level.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Recent studies indicate that chronic neuro-inflammation may affect brain physiology and alter mood and behavior. Consumption of a high-fat diet leads to obesity and chronic systemic inflammation. The gut microbiota mediates many effects of a high-fat diet on human physiology and may also influence the mood and behavior of the host. We review here recent studies suggesting the existence of a link between obesity, the gut microbiota and depression, focusing on the mechanisms underlying the effects of a high-fat diet on chronic inflammation and brain physiology. This body of research suggests that modulating the composition of the gut microbiota using prebiotics and probiotics may produce beneficial effects on anxiety and depression.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Mice were treated with uridine (30 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal injection [i.p.]) or saline solution of LPS (2. mg/kg, i. p.). Endotoxin increased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, and IL-6 by 2.1-, 1.9-, 1.7-, 1.6-, and 2.3-fold, respectively. Prior treatment with uridine prevented LPS-induced increases in all studied cytokines. In splenic lymphocytes, LPS treatment increased the expression of HSP 72 by 2.4-fold, whereas preliminary treatment with uridine completely prevented this effect. LPS also activated NF-κB signaling in splenic lymphocytes, and uridine decreased NF-κB pathway activity. Inhibitory analysis showed that the mechanism of uridine action was associated with the formation of the UDP-metabolic activator of the mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channel (mitoK) and the UTP-activator of glycogen synthesis in the tissues. A specific inhibitor of mitoK, -hydroxydecanoate ( mg/kg), and an inhibitor of glycogen synthesis, galactosamine (110 mg/kg), prevented the effects of uridine. Thus, uridine itself or uridine phosphates, which increased after uridine treatment, appeared to inhibit pro-inflammatory responses induced by LPS application. Overall, these findings demonstrated that the mechanisms mediating the effects of uridine were regulated by activation of glycogen synthesis and opening of the mitoK, which in turn increased the energy potential of the cell and reduced oxidative stress.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that hypoglycemia activates the innate immune system, which is known to increase cardiovascular risk.To determine whether hypoglycemia modifies subsequent innate immune system responses.Single-blinded, prospective study of three independent parallel groups.Twenty-four healthy participants underwent either a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic (2. mmol/L), euglycemic (6.0 mmol/L), or sham-saline clamp (n = 8 for each group). After 48 hours, all participants received low-dose (0.3 ng/kg) intravenous endotoxin.We studied in-vivo monocyte mobilization and monocyte-platelet interactions.Hypoglycemia increased total leukocytes (9.98 ± 1.14 × 109/L vs euglycemia 4.38 ± 0.53 × 109/L, P < 0.001; vs sham-saline 4.76 ± 0.36 × 109/L, P < 0.001) (mean ± SEM), mobilized proinflammatory intermediate monocytes (42.20 ± 7.52/μL vs euglycemia 20.66 ± 3.43/μL, P < 0.01; vs sham-saline 26.20 ± 3.86/μL, P < 0.05), and nonclassic monocytes (36.16 ± 4.66/μL vs euglycemia 12.72 ± 2.42/μL, P < 0.001; vs sham-saline 19.05 ± 3.81/μL, P < 0.001). Following hypoglycemia vs euglycemia, platelet aggregation to agonist (area under the curve) increased (73.87 ± 7.30 vs 52.50 ± 4.04, P < 0.05) and formation of monocyte-platelet aggregates increased (96.05 ± 14.51/μL vs 49.32 ± 6.41/μL, P < 0.05). Within monocyte subsets, hypoglycemia increased aggregation of intermediate monocytes (10.51 ± 1.42/μL vs euglycemia 4.19 ± 1.08/μL, P < 0.05; vs sham-saline 3.81± 1.42/μL, P < 0.05) and nonclassic monocytes (9.53 ± 1.08/μL vs euglycemia 2.86 ± 0.72/μL, P < 0.01; vs sham-saline 3.08 ± 1.01/μL, P < 0.05), with platelets compared with controls. Hypoglycemia led to greater leukocyte mobilization in response to subsequent low-dose endotoxin challenge (10.96 ± 0.97 vs euglycemia 8.21 ± 0.85 × 109/L, P < 0.05).Hypoglycemia mobilizes monocytes, increases platelet reactivity, promotes interaction between platelets and proinflammatory monocytes, and potentiates the subsequent immune response to endotoxin.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is an enzyme induced in many types of immune cells, including macrophages in response to inflammatory stimuli, and catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity is better known for its suppression of effector T cell immunity and its activation of regulatory T cells. However, high indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity predicts worse cardiovascular outcome and may promote atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation, suggesting a more complex role in chronic inflammatory settings. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity is also increased in obesity, yet its role in metabolic disease is still unexplored. Here, we show that obesity is associated with an increase of intestinal indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity, which shifts tryptophan metabolism from indole derivative and interleukin-22 production toward kynurenine production. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase deletion or inhibition improves insulin sensitivity, preserves the gut mucosal barrier, decreases  and chronic inflammation, and regulates lipid metabolism in liver and adipose tissues. These beneficial effects are due to rewiring of tryptophan metabolism toward a microbiota-dependent production of interleukin-22 and are abrogated after treatment with a neutralizing anti-interleukin-22 antibody. In summary, we identify an unexpected function of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in the fine tuning of intestinal tryptophan metabolism with major consequences on microbiota-dependent control of metabolic disease, which suggests indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase as a potential therapeutic target.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28952835>The SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527 suppresses mTOR activation and alleviates acute lung injury in mice with endotoxiemia.</a></h1><p>It is generally regarded that Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a longevity factor in mammals, acts as a negative regulator of inflammation. However, recent studies also found that SIRT1 might be a detrimental factor under certain inflammatory circumstance. In this study, the potential pathophysiological roles and the underlying mechanisms of SIRT1 in a mouse model with -associated acute lung injury were investigated. The results indicated that treatment with the selective SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527 suppressed LPS-induced elevation of TNF-α and IL-6 in plasma. Treatment with EX-527 attenuated LPS-induced histological abnormalities in lung tissue, which was accompanied with decreased myeloperoxidase level and suppressed induction of tissue factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Treatment with EX-527 also suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). Co-administration of a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activator 3-benzyl--[(2-nitrophenoxy) methyl]-dihydrofuran-2 (3H)-one (3BDO) abolished the inhibitory effects of EX-527 on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Meanwhile, the inhibitory effects of EX-527 on IL-6 induction and the beneficial effects of EX-527 on lung injury were partially reversed by 3BDO. This study suggests that selective inhibition of SIRT1 by EX-527 might alleviate -associated acute lung injury partially via suppression of mTOR, which implies that SIRT1 selective inhibitors might have potential value for the pharmacological intervention of inflammatory lung injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29935985>c-Kit mutation reduce intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and migration, but not influence intestinal permeability stimulated by lipopolysaccharide.</a></h1><p>The proto-oncogene c-kit, as a marker of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) in the gastrointestinal tract, plays an important role in the ICCs. Although limited evidences showed c-kit is present in the colonic epithelium but its roles remain unclear. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression, location and function of c-kit in the intestinal epithelium. Immunofluorescence, western blotting, and RT-PCR were performed to detect the expression and location of c-kit in the intestinal mucosa of WT mice. We investigated intestinal epithelial proliferation and migration in vivo by performing -Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and Ki-67 staining in WT and Wads  mice. An Ussing chamber with fluorescein-isothiocyanate dextran 4000 was used to detect the transepithelial electric resistance (TER), short circuit current (ISC) and permeability across ex vivo colon segments under control and  conditions. We demonstrated that c-kit was located and expressed in the gut crypt compartment in WT mice, which was demonstrated in the c-kit mutant mice (Wads ). In addition, both the number of proliferating cells and the percentage of the distance migrated were lower in the Wads  mice than those in the WT mice. Moreover, the intestinal permeability, TER and tight junction were unaltered in the Wads  mice under endotoxic conditions compared with those in both the control condition and the WT mice. Altogether, these observations imply that the expression of c-kit in the colonic epithelium is involved in the proliferation and permeability of the colonic epithelium.Copyright © 2018.

No difference was found in 28-day all-cause mortality. However, the trial showed that in some patients with septic shock the burden of endotoxin activity was extreme (EAA ≥ 0.9). In a post hoc analysis, we evaluated the impact of PMX use in patients with septic shock and endotoxin activity measured between 0.6-0.89.Post-hoc analysis of the EUPHRATES trial for the 194 patients with EAA ≥ 0.6-0.89 who completed two treatments (PMX or sham). The primary end point was mortality at 28 days adjusted for APACHE II score and baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP). Additional end points included changes in MAP, cumulative vasopressor index (CVI), median EAA reduction, ventilator-free days (VFD), dialysis-free days (DFD) and hospital length of stay. Subpopulations analyzed were site and type of infection and those with norepinephrine dose > 0.1 mcg/kg/min at baseline.At 28 days, 23 patients of 88 (26.1%) in the PMX group died versus 39 of 106 (36.8%) in the sham group [risk difference 10.7%, OR 0.52, 95% CI (0.27, 0.99), P = 0.047]. When unadjusted for baseline variables, P = 0.11. The 28-day survival time in the PMX group was longer than for the sham group [HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.33, 0.95) P = 0.03]. PMX treatment compared with sham showed greater change in MAP [median (IQR) 8 mmHg (- 0., 19.) vs. 4 mmHg (- 4.0, 11) P = 0.04] and VFD [median (IQR) 20 days (0., 23.) vs. 6 days (0, 20), P = 0.004]. There were no significant differences in other end points. There was a significant difference in mortality in PMX-treated patients with no bacterial growth on culture [PMX, 6/30 (20%) vs. sham, 13/31 (41.9%), P = 0.005]. The median EAA change in the population was - 12.9% (range: increase 49.2%-reduction 86.3%). The mortality in the above median EAA change group was PMX: 6/38 (15.7%) vs. sham 15/49 (30.6%), P = 0.08.These hypothesis-generating results, based on an exploratory post hoc analysis of the EUPHRATES trial, suggest measurable responses in patients with septic shock and an EAA ≥ 0.6 to 0.89 on changes in mean arterial pressure, ventilator-free days and mortality.Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: .

LPS injection inhibited occludin and claudin-1 protein generation, and this inhibitory effect of LPS was abolished by berberine. Inhibition of IGF-I/IGFBP-3 signaling by AG1024 or siRNAs reduced berberine-induced occludin and claudin-1 production.

However, the exact mechanism of these positive effects remains unkown. Here we investigated the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine could ameliorate muscle wasting in endotoxemic rats and whether it was related to hypothalamic neuropeptides alteration and inflammation. Fourty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ( mg/kg) or saline, followed by 50 μg/kg dexmedetomidine or saline administration via the femoral vein catheter (infusion at  μg·kg-1·hr-1). Twenty-four hours after injection, hypothalamus tissues and skeletal muscle were obtained. Muscle wasting was measured by the mRNA expression of two E3 ubiquitin ligases, muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF-1) as well as 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) and tyrosine release. Hypothalamic inflammatory markers and neuropeptides expression were also detected in all four groups. Results showed that LPS administration led to significant increase in hypothalamic inflammation together with muscle wasting. Increased hypothalamic neuropeptides, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript (CART) and neuropeptides Y (NPY) and decreased agouti-related protein (AgRP) were also observed. Meanwhile dexmedetomidine administration ameliorated muscle wasting, hypothalamic inflammation and modulated the alteration of neuropeptides, POMC, CART and AgRP, in endotoxemic rats. In conclusion, dexmedetomidine could alleviate muscle wasting in endotoxemic rats, and it could also attenuate the alteration of hypothalamic neuropeptides and reduce hypothalamic inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634931>Gut derived-endotoxin contributes to inflammation in severe ischemic acute kidney injury.</a></h1><p>Recent researches indicate that the intestinal consequences of renal ischemia reperfusion (IR) would predispose to the translocation of gut-derived endotoxin. Here, we designed experiments to test the hypothesis that the gut-derived endotoxin has a potential role in mediating local inflammatory processes in the acutely injured kidney.Rats were performed sham or renal IR surgery (60 min of bilateral renal ischemia, then 24 h of reperfusion) (n = ). The intestinal structural and mucosa permeability were evaluated. Serum endotoxin and bacterial load in liver and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were measured. Separate groups were pretreated with oral norfloxacin 20 mg/kg/day or saline for 4 weeks and divided into sham plus saline, sham plus norfloxacin, renal IR plus saline and renal IR plus norfloxacin group. Serum biochemistry and endotoxin were determined. Kidney pathological changes were scored. Protein or mRNA expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and proinflammatory mediators were measured in kidney homogenate.Renal IR led to marked intestinal integrity disruption and increase in intestinal permeability. These are accompanied by low grade of  as well as increased bacterial load in liver and MLN. The group pretreated with norfloxacin showed significant attenuation of the increase in serum urea, ALAT, ASAT and endotoxin. The increased renal protein or mRNA of TLR4 and proinflammatory mediators (IL-6 and MCP-1) in the unpretreated animals was significantly attenuated in the norfloxacin-pretreated animals. However, norfloxacin pretreatment did not produce any protective effects on renal tubular integrity.Our results show for the first time that gut-derived endotoxin, resulting from an increased intestinal permeability after severe renal IR, subsequently amplifies intrarenal inflammatory response by activation renal TLR4 signaling. Our study results do not establish that antibiotic administration was effective in improving the overall renal outcome. However, our findings may be the first step to understanding how to tailor therapies to mitigate intrarenal inflammation in select groups of patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31349186>Serum choline and butyrylcholinesterase changes in response to endotoxin in calves receiving intravenous choline administration.</a></h1><p> treatment options are still of interest due to high mortality and choline treatment is one of them because of its role in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. This study investigated serum choline and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) responses, and their correlations with inflammatory, oxidative stress and tissue damage biomarkers, including paraoxanase-1 (PON1), and clinical signs in calves with  and the effect of choline treatment in these responses. Healthy calves (n = 20) were divided equally into 4 groups: Control (0.9% NaCl, iv), Choline (C; 1 mg/kg/iv,once), Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 2 μg/kg/iv,once) and LPS + C. Clinical and laboratory examinations were performed before and 0.-48 h (hrs) after treatments. Following LPS administration, serum choline level increased at 0.-24 h (P < .01), whereas serum BChE and PON1 level decreased at 48 h (P < .01) compared to their baselines. In LPS + C group, the increase in serum choline level was significantly higher (P < .01) than that of C and LPS groups. LPS did not decrease serum BChE levels significantly in calves treated with choline. Serum choline and BChE results correlated negatively with white blood cell count and positively (P < .001) with PON1 levels, oxidative stress index, inflammation and hepato-muscular injury markers. In conclusion serum choline and BChE may have a role in the pathophysiology of  in calves. High serum choline concentration is associated with an improvement in response to LPS administration in calves treated with choline, probably by preventing the imbalances between oxidative stress and anti-oxidant capacity, preventing the serum BChE and PON1 decreases, and inhibition/attenuation of acute phase reaction and hepato-muscular injury in calves with .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction leads to alterations in both innate and acquired immunity, due to defects in the local immunity of liver as well as in systemic immunity. Cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction is a dynamic phenomenon, comprised of both increased systemic inflammation and immunodeficiency, and is responsible for 30% mortality. It also plays an important role in acute as well as chronic decompensation. Immune paralysis can accompany it, which is characterized by increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines and suppression of proinflammatory cytokines. There is also presence of increased gut permeability, reduced gut motility and altered gut flora, all of which leads to increased bacterial translocation. This increased bacterial translocation and consequent  leads to increased blood stream bacterial infections that cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, multiorgan failure and death. The gut microbiota of cirrhotic patients has more pathogenic microbes than that of non-cirrhotic individuals, and this disturbs the homeostasis and favors gut translocation. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of such infections are necessary for better survival. We have reviewed the various mechanisms of immune dysfunction and its consequences in cirrhosis. Recognizing the exact pathophysiology of immune dysfunction will help treating clinicians in avoiding its complications in their patients and can lead to newer therapeutic interventions and reducing the morbidity and mortality rates.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28470577>Plasma kinetics and matrix residues of deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN) are altered in endotoxaemic pigs independent of LPS entry site.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to investigate a potential modulatory effect of E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the kinetics of deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN) after pre- or post-hepatic LPS administration to unravel the putative role of the liver. Fifteen barrows were fed a diet containing mycotoxin-contaminated maize (4.59 mg DON/kg feed, 0.22 mg ZEN/kg feed) for 29 days and equipped with pre-hepatic catheters (portal vein, "po") and post-hepatic catheters (jugular vein, "ju"), facilitating simultaneous infusion of LPS ("LPS group", 7. μg/kg body weight) or 0.9% sterile NaCl solution (control, "CON group", equivolumar to LPS group) and blood sampling. This resulted in three infusion groups, depending on infusion site: CON-CON, CON-LPS, and LPS-CON. On day 29, pigs were fed their morning ration (700 g/pig) (-15 min), and blood samples were collected at regular intervals relative to infusion start. At 195 min, pigs were sacrificed and bile, urine, liquor, and liver samples collected. DON concentrations in jugular and portal blood decreased in both LPS-infused groups, whereas the ZEN concentrations increased, regardless of the treatment site. In liver tissue, a decrease of both toxin concentrations was observed in endotoxaemic pigs as well as a drop in hepatic conjugation, regardless of LPS entry site. In contrast to our hypothesis, DON and ZEN were not differently altered depending on the LPS-entry site. Neither the absorption nor the accumulation of DON and ZEN in different tissues differed significantly between animals which were infused with LPS via either the jugular or portal vein.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28536293>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonism attenuates -induced muscle protein loss and lactate accumulation in rats.</a></h1><p>The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonist rosiglitazone (Rosi) appears to provide protection against organ dysfunction during . We examined the potential benefits of Rosi on skeletal muscle protein maintenance and carbohydrate metabolism during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced . Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either standard chow (control) or standard chow containing Rosi (8. ± 0.1 mg·kg·day) for 2 weeks before and during 24 h continuous intravenous infusion of LPS (15 μg·kg·h) or saline. Rosi blunted LPS-induced increases in muscle tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA by 70% (<0.05) and 64% (<0.01) respectively. Furthermore, Rosi suppressed the LPS-induced reduction in phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated Forkhead box O (FOXO) 1 protein, as well as the up-regulation of muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1; <0.01) mRNA and the LPS-induced increase in 20S proteasome activity (<0.05). Accordingly, LPS reduced the muscle protein:DNA ratio (∼30%, <0.001), which Rosi offset. Increased muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) mRNA (<0.001) and muscle lactate accumulation (<0.001) during  were suppressed by Rosi. Thus, pre-treatment with Rosi reduced muscle cytokine accumulation and blunted muscle protein loss and lactate accumulation during , and at least in part by reducing activation of molecular events known to increase muscle protein breakdown and mitochondrial pyruvate use.© 2017 The Author(s).

Recently, we reported that MORG1 mice are protected from renal injury induced by systemic hypoxia and acute renal ischemia-reperfusion injury via increased hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Here, we explore whether MORG1 heterozygosity could attenuate renal injury in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced . was induced in mice by an intraperitoneal (i.p) application of  mg/kg BW LPS. The renal damage was estimated by periodic acid Schiff's staining; renal injury was evaluated by detection of urinary and plasma levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and albumin/creatinine ratio via ELISAs. Renal mRNA expression was assessed by real-time PCR, whereas the protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry or Western blotting.LPS administration increased tubular injury, microalbuminuria, IL-6 plasma levels and renal TNF-α expression in MORG1  mice. This was accompanied with enhanced infiltration of the inflammatory T-cells in renal tissue and activation of the NF-κB transcription factors. In contrast, endotoxemic MORG1  showed significantly less tubular injury, reduced plasma IL-6 levels, significantly decreased renal TNF-α expression and T-cells infiltration. In support, the renal levels of activated caspase-3 were lower in endotoxemic MORG1  mice compared with endotoxemic MORG1  mice. Interestingly, LPS application induced a significantly higher accumulation of renal HIF-2α in the kidneys of MORG1 mice than in wild-type mice, accompanied with a diminished phosphorylation of IκB-α and IKK α,β and decreased iNOS mRNA in the renal tissues of the LPS-challenged MORG1 mice, indicating an inhibition of the NF-κB transcriptional activation.MORG1 heterozygosity protects against histological renal damage and shows anti-inflammatory effects in a murine  model through modulation of HIF-2α stabilisation and/or simultaneous inhibition of the NF-κB signalling. Here, we show for the first time that MORG1 scaffold could represent the missing link between innate immunity and inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035432>Grape-Seed Proanthocyanidins are Able to Reverse Intestinal Dysfunction and Metabolic  Induced by a Cafeteria Diet in Wistar Rats.</a></h1><p>We evaluated the effectiveness of pharmacological doses of grape-seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) in reversing intestinal barrier alterations and local inflammation in female Wistar rats fed a long-term obesogenic diet. Animals were fed a 17-week cafeteria diet (CAF diet), supplemented with daily GSPE doses (100 or 500 mg kg body weight) during the final two weeks. CAF diet enhanced the intestinal permeation of an orally administered marker (ovalbumin, OVA) and increased the plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in 2-3-fold. Ex vivo Ussing chamber assays showed a 55-70% reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased the TNF-α secretions in both small and large intestinal sections with a 25-fold increment in the ileum. Ileal tissues also presented a 4-fold increase of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Both GSPE-treatments were able to restitute TEER values in the ileum and colon and to reduce plasma LPS to basal levels without a dose-dependent effect. However, effects on the OVA permeation and TNF-α secretion were dose and section-specific. GSPE also reduced ileal MPO activity and upregulated claudin 1 gene expression. This study provides evidence of the efficacy of GSPE-supplementation ameliorating diet-induced intestinal dysfunction and metabolic  when administered at the end of a long-term obesogenic diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29731490>Sulfasalazine treatment can cause a positive effect on LPS-induced endotoxic rats.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study, was to determine the effect of sulfasalazine for different periods of time reduces disseminated intravascular coagulation, inflammation and organ damages by inhibiting the nuclear factor kappa beta pathway. The study was performed with 30 Wistar albino rats and the groups were established as Control group, LPS group;  was induced with LPS, SL5 group: sulfasalazine (300 mg/kg, single dose daily) was administered for  days before the LPS-induced , and LS group: sulfasalazine (300 mg/kg, single dose) was administered similtenously with LPS. Hemogram, biochemical, cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α) and acute phase proteins (HPT, SAA, PGE2) analyzes and oxidative status values were measured from blood samples at 3 and 6 h after the last applications in the all groups. The rats were euthanized at 6 h and mRNA levels of BCL2 and BAX genes were examined from liver and brain tissues. Sulfasalazine reduced the increased IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and PGE levels and significantly increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels. In addition, decreasing of ATIII level was prevented in the SL5 group, and decreasing of fibrinogen levels were prevented in the LS and SL5 groups within first 3 h. In LPS group, leukocyte and thrombocyte levels were decreased, however sulfasalazine application inhibited decreases of leukocyte levels in LS and SL5 groups. In addition, sulfasalazine inhibited the decrease of total antioxidant capacity and unchanged apoptosis in brain and liver.

After scrutinizing the immune modulation exerted by a recombinant  fatty acid binding protein termed Fh15, our group demonstrated that addition of Fh15 to murine macrophages 1 h prior to LPS stimulation significantly suppresses the expression of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL1-β). The present study aimed to demonstrate that Fh15 could exert a similar anti-inflammatory effect  using a mouse model of septic shock. Among the novel findings reported in this article, (i) Fh15 suppressed numerous serum proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines when injected intraperitoneally 1 h after exposure of animals to lethal doses of LPS, (ii) concurrently, Fh15 increased the population of large peritoneal macrophages (LPMs) in the peritoneal cavity (PerC) of LPS-injected animals, and (iii) Fh15 downregulated the expression on spleen macrophages of CD38, a cell surface ectoenzyme with a critical role during inflammation. These findings present the first evidence that the recombinant parasitic antigen Fh15 is an excellent modulator of the PerC cell content and  macrophage activation, endorsing Fh15's potential as a drug candidate against sepsis-related inflammatory response. Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. Sepsis is mostly the consequence of systemic bacterial infections leading to exacerbated activation of immune cells by bacterial products, resulting in enhanced release of inflammatory mediators. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of sepsis, which is sensed by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The scientific community highly pursues the development of antagonists capable of blocking the cytokine storm by blocking TLR4. We report here that a recombinant molecule of 14. kDa belonging to the  fatty acid binding protein (Fh15) is capable of significantly suppressing the LPS-induced cytokine storm in a mouse model of septic shock when administered by the intraperitoneal route 1 h after a lethal LPS injection. These results suggest that Fh15 is an excellent candidate for drug development against .Copyright © 2018 Ramos-Benitez et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28216642>High-fat meal, systemic inflammation and glucose homeostasis in obese children and adolescents.</a></h1><p>We aimed to assess in obese youths the relationships between interleukin-6 (IL-6), fat meal-induced  and glucose homeostasis. Twenty obese children/adolescents (9-17 years old, 11 boys) underwent a standard oral glucose tolerance test and, 7-14 days later, a -h fat meal test (fat=69% of energy, saturated/monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fatty acids=31.%/35%/33.%), with serial measures of IL-6 and two markers of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure and translocation, LPS-binding protein (LBP) and soluble CD14 (sCD14). IL-6 correlated not only with basal (homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance) but also with post-prandial (Matsuda index) insulin sensitivity (r=0.61 (0.24-0.82), P=0.005, r=-0.53 (0.12-0.78), P=0.03, respectively). IL-6 did not change after the meal whereas LBP and sCD14 decreased significantly, indicating LPS translocation. Neither basal sCD14 and LBP nor their incremental concentrations correlated with IL-6 or glucose homeostasis. In our sample, IL-6 was associated with insulin sensitivity but not with LPS exposure, suggesting that meals with a balanced content of saturated/monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fatty acids may not be associated with LPS-induced inflammation and metabolic impairment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28667502>Lysophosphatidic Acid Protects Against Endotoxin-Induced Acute Kidney Injury.</a></h1><p>Septic shock is the most common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and no targeted therapies exist. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lipid which in vivo administration was reported to mitigate inflammation and injuries caused by bacterial  in the liver and lung. The objective of the present study was to determine whether LPA can protect against sepsis-associated AKI. C57BL/6 mice were treated with LPA 18:1 ( mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h before being injected with the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and AKI was evaluated after 24 h. LPA significantly decreased the elevation of plasma urea and creatinine caused by LPS. In the kidney, LPA pretreatment significantly reduced the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNFα, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)), and completely prevented downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha and upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 caused by LPS. LPA also prevented LPS-mediated alterations of the renal mitochondrial ultrastructure. In vitro pretreatment with LPA 18:1 significantly attenuated LPS-induced upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines (TNFα and MCP-1) in RAW264 macrophages. Moreover, in vivo LPS treatment lowered urinary LPA concentration and reduced LPA anabolic enzymes (autotaxin and acylglycerol kinase), and increased the LPA catalytic enzyme (lipid phosphate phosphatase 2) expression in the kidney cortex. In conclusion, exogenous LPA exerted a protective action against renal inflammation and injuries caused by bacterial . Moreover, LPS reduces the renal production of LPA suggesting that sepsis-associated AKI could be mediated, at least in part, by alleviation of the protective action of endogenous LPA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28796276>Colistin dampens fibrinolysis and endothelial activation during .

Pre-clinical studies demonstrated beneficial effects of colistin on LPS-induced coagulation and fibrinolysis. The objective of this trial was to investigate the effects of colistin during experimental . In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial 16 healthy volunteers received a 2 ng/kg LPS bolus after infusion of 2. million IU colistin or placebo. Plasma levels of F1+2 prothrombin fragments, thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), von Willebrand factor antigen levels (vWF), E-selectin, plasmin-antiplasmin complexes (PAP), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen and activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were measured. Infusion of colistin significantly reduced peak concentrations of PAP complexes by 70 %, t-PA antigen levels by 63 % and t-PA activity by 48 %, while PAI-1 levels decreased numerically by 63 %. Two hours after the LPS bolus F1+2 levels and TAT complexes were slightly reduced in the colistin period, but peak concentrations were similar in both periods. Colistin blunted the LPS induced four-fold increase in soluble E-Selectin levels by ~50 % and the two-fold increase in vWF antigen levels by ~70 %. The LPS-scavenging actions of colistin significantly reduce endothelial activation and fibrinolytic response in the human  model, while the activation of the coagulation system remains largely unaffected.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776686>Fluid resuscitation with 0.9% saline alters haemostasis in an ovine model of endotoxemic shock.</a></h1><p>Fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of severe sepsis management, however there are many uncertainties surrounding the type and volume of fluid that is administered. The entire spectrum of coagulopathies can be seen in sepsis, from asymptomatic aberrations to fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The aim of this study was to determine if fluid resuscitation with saline contributes to the haemostatic derangements in an ovine model of endotoxemic shock.Twenty-one adult female sheep were randomly divided into no  (n = ) or  groups (n = 16) with an escalating dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) up to 4 μg/kg/h administered to achieve a mean arterial pressure below 60 mmHg.  sheep received either no bolus fluid resuscitation (n = 8) or a 0.9% saline bolus (40 mL/kg over 60 min) (n = 8). No , saline only animals (n = ) underwent fluid resuscitation with a 0.9% bolus of saline as detailed above. Hemodynamic support with vasopressors was initiated if needed, to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60-65 mm Hg in all the groups.Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) and conventional coagulation biomarker tests demonstrated sepsis induced derangements to secondary haemostasis. This effect was exacerbated by saline fluid resuscitation, with low pH (p = 0.036), delayed clot initiation and formation together with deficiencies in naturally occurring anti-coagulants antithrombin (p = 0.027) and Protein C (p = 0.001). impairs secondary haemostasis and induces changes in the intrinsic, extrinsic and anti-coagulant pathways. These changes to haemostasis are exacerbated following resuscitation with 0.9% saline, a commonly used crystalloid in clinical settings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Mice studies show gut barrier disruption and diet-induced insulin resistance can be alleviated by cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22). However, little is known about IL-22 in humans and its association with gut-beneficial nutrients like fibre. We investigated whether fibre intake was associated with circulating levels of IL-22 in 48 participants with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Bivariate analysis was used to explore associations between circulating IL-22, fibre intake, MetS factors, body composition, and cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen uptake, V ˙ O). Hierarchical multiple regression (HMR) was used to test the independent association of fibre intake with circulating IL-22, adjusting for variables correlated with IL-22. Circulating IL-22 was positively associated with fibre intake (r = 0.393,  < 0.006). The HMR-adjusted model explained 40% of circulating IL-22 variability, and fibre intake significantly improved the prediction model by 8.4% ( < 0.022). Participants with fibre intake above median intake of 21. g/day had a significantly higher circulating IL-22 than the lower intake group (308.3 ± 454.4 vs. 69.0 ± 106.4 pg/mL,  < 0.019). Fibre intake is independently associated with increased circulating IL-22 in individuals with MetS.

Previously it was believed that this inflammation was mediated by a decline in the immunosuppressive action of testosterone. However, more recently an alternative hypothesis (GELDING theory) has suggested that inflammation originating from the passage of intestinal bacteria into the circulation (metabolic ) may actually be the cause of impaired testicular function in obese men. The aim of this study is to investigate if metabolic , as quantified by serum Lipopolysaccharide Binding Protein (LBP), is associated with impaired testicular endocrine function.A total of 50 men aged between 21 and 50 years (mean 35.1 ± 6.8 years) were assessed for adiposity (BMI, waist circumference and % body fat using bio-impedance), inflammatory status (serum CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα and LBP) and testicular endocrine function (serum testosterone, estradiol, AMH, LH and FSH). Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson correlation analysis, with log transformation of data where appropriate, and multi-variate regression.Overall increasing adiposity (% body fat) was positively associated with metabolic  (LBP, r = 0.366, p = 0.009) and inflammation (CRP r = 0.531, p < 0.001; IL-6 r = 0.463, p = 0.001), while also being negatively correlated with serum testosterone (r = -0.403, p = 0.004). Serum testosterone levels were significantly negatively correlated with inflammation (CRP r = -0.471, p = 0.001; IL-6 r = -0.516, p < 0.001) and  (LBP) after adjusting for serum LH levels (p = -0.317, p = 0.03). Furthermore, serum IL-6 was negatively associated with AMH levels (r = -0.324, p = 0.023), with a negative trend between LBP and AMH also approaching significance (r = -0.267, p = 0.064).Obesity and its associated metabolic  helps initiate a pro-inflammatory state characterised by raised serum IL-6 levels, which in turn is correlated with impairment of both Leydig (testosterone) and Sertoli cell function (AMH).

The cycling task comprised of alternating 3 min intervals at a moderate-vigorous intensity (50% and 70% of maximum power output; P) for 30 min, followed by 30 min at moderate intensity (40-50% P). Neuromuscular function was assessed at pre-, post-exercise and 60 min post-exercise. Circulating levels of endotoxins, inflammatory cytokines and markers of gut permeability and damage were also collected at these time points. Heart rate, core temperature, skin temperature, perceived exertion, thermal sensation and comfort were also measured.Post-exercise voluntary activation of HOT (87.9% [85.2, 90.8]) was statistically lower (mean difference - 2.% [- 4., - 0.], d = 2.50) than that of CON (90.% [87.8, 93.2]). The HOT trial resulted in statistically elevated (+ 69%) markers of gastrointestinal damage compared to CON (mean difference 0.424 ng mL [0.163, 0.684, d = - 3.26]), although this was not observed for endotoxin, other inflammatory markers, or gastrointestinal permeability.This research provides evidence that short-duration cycling in the heat results in sub-optimal neuromuscular activation and increased expression of gastrointestinal damage markers, without a simultaneous elevation in circulating endotoxins or pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31084985>Remote ischaemic preconditioning does not modulate the systemic inflammatory response or renal tubular stress biomarkers after  in healthy human volunteers: a single-centre, mechanistic, randomised controlled trial.</a></h1><p>Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) consists of repeated cycles of limb ischaemia and reperfusion, which may reduce perioperative myocardial ischaemic damage and kidney injury. We hypothesised that RIPC may be beneficial by attenuating the systemic inflammatory response. We investigated whether RIPC affects the response in humans to bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) by measuring plasma cytokines and renal cell-cycle arrest mediators, which reflect renal tubular stress.Healthy male volunteers were randomised to receive either daily RIPC for 6 consecutive days (RIPC, n=10) plus RIPC during the 40 min preceding i.v. LPS (2 ng kg), RIPC only during the 40 min before LPS (RIPC, n=10), or no RIPC preceding LPS (control, n=10). As a surrogate marker of renal tubular stress, the product of urinary concentrations of two cell-cycle arrest markers was calculated (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 [TIMP2]*insulin-like growth factor binding protein-7 [IGFBP7]). Data are presented as median (inter-quartile range).In both RIPC groups, RIPC alone increased [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7]. LPS administration resulted in fever, flu-like symptoms, and haemodynamic alterations.

LPS administration also increased urinary [TIMP2[*[IGFBP7]. RIPC had no effect on LPS-induced cytokine release or [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7].RIPC neither modulated systemic cytokine release nor attenuated inflammation-induced tubular stress after LPS.

This study aimed to determine the effect of exercise-induced hypohydration on gastrointestinal integrity, function, symptoms, and systemic endotoxin and inflammatory profiles. In a randomized crossover design, male endurance runners ( = 11) performed 2 h of running at 70% of maximum oxygen uptake in 25°C ambient temperature with water provision [euhydration (EuH)] and total water restriction [hypohydration (HypoH)] during running, which accounted for 0.6 ± 0.6% and 3.1 ± 0.7% body mass loss, respectively. Blood and fecal samples were collected before and after exercise. Breath samples (H determination) were collected and gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) recorded before, during, and after exercise. HypoH resulted in a higher, yet insignificant, ∆ preexercise to postexercise plasma cortisol concentration (+286 nmol/l vs. +176 nmol/l;  = 0.098) but significantly higher intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) (+539 pg/ml vs. +371 pg/ml;  = 0.047) concentration compared with EuH. A greater breath H response ( = 0.026) was observed on HypoH (1,188 ppm/3 h, peak +12 ppm) vs. EuH (579 ppm/3 h, peak +6 ppm). Despite greater GIS incidence on HypoH (82%) vs. EuH (64%), GIS severity scores were not significant between trials. Exercise-induced leukocytosis (overall pre- to postexercise: .9 × 10/l to 12.1 × 10/l) was similar on both trials. Depressed in vitro neutrophil function was observed during recovery on HypoH (-36%) but not on EUH (+6%). A pre- to postexercise increase ( < 0.05) was observed for circulating cytokine concentrations but not endotoxin values. Hypohydration during 2 h of running modestly perturbs gastrointestinal integrity and function and increases GIS incidence but does not affect systemic  and cytokinemia.  Despite anecdotal beliefs that exercise-induced hypohydration exacerbates perturbations to gastrointestinal status, the present study reports only modest perturbations in gastrointestinal integrity, function, and symptoms compared with euhydration maintenance. Exercise-induced hypohydration does not exacerbate systemic  and cytokinemia compared with euhydration maintenance. Programmed water intake to maintain euhydration results in gastrointestinal symptom severity similar to exercise-induced hypohydration.

A single high-fat, high-carbohydrate (HFHC) meal induces an increase in inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Previous studies have shown that orange juice is able to prevent this response by inhibiting toll like receptors (TLR) expression and . Our goal was to study the proteome response in PBMC after the consumption of a HFHC meal consumed with water, orange juice or an isocaloric beverage (water with glucose). Twelve healthy individuals completed the protocol in a crossover design, and blood samples were obtained before and 1, 3, and  h after consumption. Proteomic profile, glucose, insulin, lipid and cytokines levels were investigated. The glycemic and insulinemic response was higher when the meal was consumed with glucose, while there was no difference in the response between water and orange juice. Proteome analysis in PBMC was carried out using TMT ten-plex. A total of 3813 proteins, originating from 15 662 peptides were identified. Three proteins showed significantly altered expression in the three treatments: apolipoprotein A-II, ceruloplasmin and hemopexin. When the HFHC meal was consumed with water there was an increase in some inflammatory pathways such as the Fc-gamma receptor dependent phagocytosis and the complement cascade, but the immune system as a whole was not significantly altered. However, when the meal was consumed with glucose, the immune system was up regulated. Among the pathways induced after 3 h were those of the adaptive immune system and cytokine signaling. Five hours after the meal, pathways of the complement cascade and classical antibody mediated complement activation were up regulated. When the meal was consumed with orange juice there was an up regulation of proteins involved in signal transduction, DNA replication and cell cycle. The promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) showed a 28.2-fold increase. This protein was down regulated when the meal was consumed with water. Regarding the immune system, several of the pathways induced by glucose were down regulated when the meal was consumed with orange juice: proteins involved with the adaptive immune system and cytokine signaling.

Using public datasets, we identified key differences in pathway activity (Pathprint) in blood transcriptome profiles of septic adults and children. To find drugs that could promote beneficial (child) pathways or inhibit harmful (adult) ones, we built an  pathway drug network (PDN) using expression correlation between drug, disease, and pathway gene signatures across 58,475 microarrays. Specific pathway clusters from children or adults were assessed for correlation with drug-based signatures. Validation by literature curation and by direct testing in an  model of murine sepsis of the most correlated drug candidates demonstrated that the Pathprint-PDN methodology is more effective at generating positive drug leads than gene-level methods (e.g., CMap). Pathway-centric Pathprint-PDN is a powerful new way to identify drug candidates for intervention against sepsis and provides direct insight into pathways that may determine survival.© 2018 The Authors.

A discussion on the press release for EUPHRATES trial.</a></h1><p>The efficacy of polymyxin B-immobilized (PMX) fiber column on septic shock is still under debate. Recently, the result from "Evaluating the Use of Polymyxin B Hemoperfusion in a Randomized controlled trial of Adults Treated for  and Septic shock (EUPHRATES)" trial has been announced as a press release. According to that report, less than a % mortality difference was recognized in the "per protocol population" ( = 244, 31.9 vs. 36.9%) and the decrease was not statistically significant. However, among the patients in refractory shock with a multiple organ dysfunction score of more than 9 and an EAA between 0.6 and 0.9, a 10.7% reduction in 28-day mortality was recognized ( = 0.0474) when they received two sessions of hemoperfusion using the PMX fiber column. Since this favorable effect was obtained from "post hoc" analysis, further study is expected.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30135596>LPS-induced maternal inflammation promotes fetal leukocyte recruitment and prenatal organ infiltration in mice.</a></h1><p>A pro-inflammatory intrauterine milieu accounts for increased perinatal morbidity and mortality. We asked how maternal inflammation as seen in  affects fetal leukocyte recruitment in vivo during late gestation.Inflammation was induced in pregnant LysEGFP-mice by intraperitoneal LPS injection between gestational day 14 and 18 (E14-E18). After 20 h, intravital fluorescence microscopy was performed on fetal yolk sac venules to examine leukocyte rolling (number of rolling cells/min) and adhesion (>30 s). Infiltration of neutrophils into chorion/amnion, lung, and kidney were quantified by immunofluorescence microscopy.At high doses (2 × 1 mg/kg), LPS triggered preterm birth (PTB) and intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), with early gestations at high risk of IUFD and late gestations prone to PTB. Lower LPS dosing (2 × 0.25 mg/kg) did not induce labor, but promoted maternal and fetal cytokine production, as well as neutrophilic infiltration of fetal membranes, as seen in chorioamnionitis (CAM). Baseline fetal leukocyte recruitment increased throughout gestation, and maternal inflammation further augmented adhesion at E16-E18. Enhanced leukocyte recruitment ultimately translated into prominent infiltration of fetal lung and kidney.LPS-induced maternal  promotes IUFD, PTB, and fetal leukocyte recruitment depending on gestational age.

To study the role of neutrophils in LPS-induced , we developed a new mouse model,  mice, in which injection of diphtheria toxin induces selective neutrophil ablation. Using this model, we found, surprisingly, that neutrophils serve to protect the host from LPS-induced lethal inflammation. This protective role was observed in conventional and germ-free animal facilities, indicating that it does not depend on a particular microbiological environment. Blockade or genetic deletion of myeloperoxidase (MPO), a key neutrophil enzyme, significantly increased mortality after LPS challenge, and adoptive transfer experiments confirmed that neutrophil-derived MPO contributes importantly to protection from . Our findings imply that, in addition to their well-established antimicrobial properties, neutrophils can contribute to optimal host protection by limiting the extent of endotoxin-induced inflammation in an MPO-dependent manner.© 2017 Reber et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29980183>NGAL protects against endotoxin-induced renal tubular cell damage by suppressing apoptosis.</a></h1><p>We sought to confirm that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) protects against apoptosis during . was induced in rats with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 3. mg/kg) and serum creatinine (SCr), urinary NGAL (uNGAL), renal histopathology confirmed acute kidney injury (AKI). Renal caspase 3 and NGAL were assayed with immunohistochemistry 6 h later. A HK-2 cell model was used in which NGAL and caspase 3 mRNA were evaluated by qRT-PCR within 6 h after LPS (50 μM) treatment, and correlations were studied. NGAL and caspase 3 mRNA expression were measured after delivering NGAL siRNA in HK-2 cells and apoptosis was measured with TUNEL and flow cytometry.SCr and uNGAL were significantly increased after LPS treatment and renal morphology data indicated AKI and renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. Caspase 3 and NGAL were predominantly expressed in the tubular epithelial cells and there was a correlation between caspase 3 and NGAL protein (r = 0.663, p = 0.01). In vitro, there was a strong correlation between caspase 3 and NGAL mRNA in LPS-injured HK-2 cells within 24 h (r = 0.448, p < 0.05). Suppressing the NGAL gene in HK-2 cells increased caspase 3 mRNA 4.-fold and apoptosis increased 1.-fold after LPS treatment.NGAL is associated with caspase 3 in renal tubular cells with endotoxin-induced kidney injury, and may regulate its expression and inhibit apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30521270>Meningococcemia.</a></h1><p>One of the most serious and life-threatening infectious diseases during childhood is bacteremia; a consequence of which is septic shock where inadequate perfusion of tissues occur due to .  () is an important bacterial infection manifesting as meningitis or septicemia, or more often a combination of both. Asymptomatic pharyngeal colonization is the initial step of infection with humans being the natural reservoirs. From the nasopharynx, the coccus reaches the meninges translocating across the nasopharyngeal mucosa and along the perineural sheath of the olfactory nerve, through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. Bloodstream spread to the meninges will cause meningitis. In some children, the predominant feature is cardiovascular collapse leading to septic shock. Transmission occurs by respiratory droplets and requires close direct contact. Children younger than  years do not have adequate immunity against the polysaccharide antigens of . The risk factors for infectious disease in child care facilities include immunologic susceptibility, lack of awareness and practice of good hygiene, a natural tendency to intimacy, frequent oral contact with objects in the environment.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether the new product gallic acid-L-leucine (GAL) conjugate could ameliorate the LPS-induced dysregulation of arachidonic acid metabolism and NO production. We first investigated the effects of GAL conjugate on the expression of proinflammatory enzymes and the production of proinflammatory NO and lipid mediators in mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7, primary peritoneal macrophages, and mouse model. Western blot analyses revealed that GAL attenuated LPS-induced expression of iNOS, COX-2, and -LOX in a concentration-dependent manner. Consistently, probing NO-mediated fluorescence revealed that GAL antagonized the stimulatory effect of LPS on iNOS activity. By profiling of lipid mediators with ESI-MS-based lipidomics, we found that GAL suppressed LPS-induced overproduction of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2, leukotriene B4, and thromboxane B2. We further discovered that GAL might exhibit anti-inflammatory activities by the following mechanisms: (1) suppressing LPS-induced activation of MAP kinases (i.e., ERK1/2, JNK, and p38); (2) reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); and (3) preventing LPS-induced nuclear translocation of transcription factors NF-B and AP-1. Consequently, GAL significantly decreased the levels of COX-2 and iNOS expression and the plasma levels of proinflammatory lipid mediators in LPS-treated mice. GAL pretreatment enhanced the survival of mice against LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Taken together, our results suggest that GAL may be a potential anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of  and sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28618763>Comparison of endothelin and nitric oxide synthase blockers on hemorheological parameters in endotoxemic rats.</a></h1><p>Septic shock is an important health problem that vastly alters cardiovascular and hemodynamic status. Increased production of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin is a counterpart of this endotoxemic state. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that nonselective NO synthesis blocker (L-NAME), inducible NO synthesis blocker (L-canavanine), or endothelin receptor antagonist (bosentan) will reverse the effects of sepsis on hemorheological parameters.Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in 8 groups: saline (control), endotoxin, bosentan, L-NAME, L-canavanine, endotoxin + bosentan, endotoxin + L-NAME, and endotoxin + L-canavanine. Blood was withdrawn at the 4th hour of endotoxemic state. Erythrocyte deformability and erythrocyte aggregation were determined by laser-assisted optical rotational cell analyzer at 37 °C. Plasma viscosity (mPa.s) was measured by a cone-plate viscometer with 0. mL of plasma.Endotoxin administration significantly increased aggregation half-time and lowered erythrocyte aggregation amplitude and aggregation index compared to the control, indicating a slower and weaker aggregation pattern. L-NAME and L-canavanine alleviated the effects of endotoxin on erythrocyte aggregation without altering the values in the control animals. However, bosentan did not perform such a restoration.This finding suggests that these restoration effects of the blockers occur via their modulation of nitric oxide synthesis rather than through the endothelin pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30903510>Age-Specific Features of Hypoxia Tolerance and Intensity of Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Systemic Inflammatory Response in Wistar Rats.</a></h1><p>Hypoxia tolerance and the intensity of systemic inflammatory response during  were examined in newborn, prepubertal, and mature Wistar rats. To assess the sensitivity to hypoxia, the rats were placed into a pressure chamber simulating an altitude of 11,500 m. The systemic inflammatory response was provoked by intraperitoneal injection of LPS from E. coli O26:B6. Serum concentrations of HIF-1α, neopterin, C-reactive protein, and endotoxin were measured. In histological sections of the liver, the area of necrosis was assessed. The smallest tolerance of the prepubertal males to hypoxia correlated with the greatest manifestations of hepatic inflammation and elevated endotoxin, neopterin, and C-reactive protein. Elevation of serum HIF-1α in 3 h after LPC injection was observed in only prepubertal rats.

Six-week-old Balb/c mice were treated with L. casei for  consecutive days. Then treated and untreated mice received an LPS injection (L. casei + LPS and LPS groups, respectively). Liver and kidney were removed, blood samples were obtained, and hemostatic and inflammatory parameters were evaluated at different times post LPS injection. Preventive L. casei administration induced a significant decrease in proinflammatory TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines by decreasing tissue factor expression in liver and kidney. Moreover, the lower expression of tissue factor in the L. casei + LPS group led to a lower activation of the coagulation system, which was observed by the fast systemic restoration of factors VII and V coagulation factors and antithrombin levels. This study highlights the capacity of L. casei to modulate the hemostatic unbalance in an acute  model.

We tested its involvement in a variety of inflammatory responses using human AGP-1 purified to apparent homogeneity and confirmed its identity by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. AGP-1 alone upregulated MAPK signaling in murine peritoneal macrophages. However, when given in combination with TLR ligands, AGP-1 selectively augmented MAPK activation induced by ligands of TLR-2 (Braun lipoprotein) but not TLR-4 (lipopolysaccharide). In vivo treatment of AGP-1 in a murine model of sepsis with or without TLR-2 or TLR-4 ligands, selectively potentiated TLR-2-mediated mortality, but was without significant effect on TLR-4-mediated mortality. Furthermore, in vitro, AGP-1 selectively potentiated TLR-2 mediated adhesion of human primary immune cell, neutrophils. Hence, our studies highlight a new role for the acute phase protein AGP-1 in sepsis via its interaction with TLR-2 signaling mechanisms to selectively promote responsiveness to one of the two major gram-negative endotoxins, contributing to the complicated pathobiology of sepsis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Since both actors are elicited during , a condition associated with the risk of cardiovascular events, we investigated whether  promotes LTB4-mediated neutrophil infiltration in plaques and explored the roles of LTB4 and neutrophils in plaque destabilization. induced by repeated peritoneal endotoxin injections at a non-lethal dose (1. mg/kg,  days) in chow-fed aged Apoe-/- mice (over 45 weeks old) resulted in neutrophil infiltration and activation in plaques. Subsequently to neutrophil invasion, plaques exhibited increased features of vulnerability: reduced collagen content, expanded necrotic cores, and thinned fibrous caps. These plaque features were reproduced by direct deposition of isolated neutrophils onto murine atheromatous carotid arteries in an in vivo assay. In endotoxemic mice, plaques produced increased amounts of LTB4. Genomic or pharmacological impairments of this production reduced neutrophil infiltration, collagenolysis, and apoptosis of smooth muscle cells in plaques of endotoxemic mice. Furthermore, conditioned media of human culprit plaques (CPs) contained more LTB4 than non-CPs and levels of LTB4 correlated to both neutrophil activation markers and endotoxin releases in CPs.These results show that the increased neutrophil recruitment elicited by LTB4 contributes to increase features of plaque destabilization in endotoxemic contexts and point out LTB4 as a potential therapeutic target in atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28620821>Administration of Exogenous Melatonin After the Onset of Systemic Inflammation Is Hardly Beneficial.</a></h1><p>Melatonin improves survival and functional impairment including hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and hypotension when administered in a prophylactic manner or early after initiation of sepsis or . In the present study, melatonin was given not before first symptoms of systemic inflammation became manifest. Lipopolysaccharide was infused at a rate of 0. mg/kg × h to induce systemic inflammation in male Wistar rats. Melatonin (single dose 3 mg/kg × 15 min) was intravenously administered 180 and 270 min after starting of the lipopolysaccharide infusion. Systemic and vital parameters (e.g., systemic blood pressure and breathing rate) as well as blood and plasma parameters (acid-base parameters; electrolytes; parameters of tissue injury such as glucose concentration, lactate concentration, hemolysis, and aminotransferase activities; parameters of thromboelastometry; and platelet count) were determined in regular intervals. Infusion of lipopolysaccharide led to characteristic symptoms of severe systemic inflammation including hypotension, metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia, electrolyte and hemostatic disturbances, thrombocytopenia, and hemolysis. Melatonin neither decreased mortality nor reduced lipopolysaccharide-dependent changes to vital, blood, and plasma parameters.

Mice with aGVHD become hypersensitive to LPS, secreting large quantities of inflammatory mediators that exacerbate tissue injury. We hypothesized that microRNA (miR) modulators could be used in vivo to mitigate LPS hypersensitivity, altering the course of aGVHD. Using the C57BL/6 → (C57BL/6 × DBA/2)F -hybrid model of aGVHD, we measured intestinal permeability over time and used a qPCR array to detect concomitant changes in the expression levels of certain microRNAs (miRs) in the intestine. Large increases in permeability were seen on day 15, when  becomes detectable and GVHD-associated histopathological lesions develop. Amongst the miRs with altered expression levels were some that regulate sensitivity to endotoxin. We chose to focus on miR-146a and treated recipient mice systemically with a miR-146a mimic early in the GVH reaction. This led to a reduction in the burst of IFNγ that likely plays a priming role in the mechanism underlying heightened sensitivity to endotoxin. LPS-induced TNFα release and GVHD-associated weight loss were also diminished and survival was prolonged. In summary, systemic treatment with a miR-146a mimic dampens the heightened sensitivity to LPS that occurs concomitantly with increased intestinal permeability and provides partial protection from the progression of acute GVHD.© 2017 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240112>Molecular markers relevant to myocardial injury following dental extraction in patients with or without coronary artery disease.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to characterize biological changes following dental extractions in patients with or without coronary artery disease (CAD).Forty-five patients (36 males and 9 females) referred for dental extraction underwent treatment and provided blood samples before, immediately after, and 24 h after the procedure. A broad array of biomarkers was employed to assess myocardial injury (highly sensitive troponin T, hs-TnT), bacterial burden (LPS endotoxin activity), and systemic inflammation (CRP, fibrinogen, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α).Dental extraction in patients with or without CAD was associated with rises in hs-TnT ( = 0.013), hs-CRP ( < 0.001), fibrinogen ( = 0.005), endotoxin activity ( < 0.001), IFN-γ ( < 0.001), IL-6 ( < 0.001), IL-8 ( = 0.011), and IL-12 ( < 0.001) at 24 h compared with immediately post procedure. Changes in systemic inflammation and endotoxin activity were more evident in those with hs-TnT rise.Simple dental extractions may cause mild increase in hs-TnT, indicating minor myocardial injury in both patients with or without CAD. Acute systemic inflammation and  could represent a possible link between invasive dental treatment and increased risk of acute cardiovascular events. These findings indicate that invasive dental treatment (as simple as a single dental extraction) may impact negatively on clinical outcomes in dental patients, especially those with CAD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30357579>Protective Effects of Sodium Pyruvate during Systemic Inflammation Limited to the Correction of Metabolic Acidosis.</a></h1><p>Protective effects by exogenous sodium pyruvate already have been described in various experimental models of injury, among others during intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury, hemorrhagic shock, and shock secondary to systemic inflammation (endotoxemic shock). Low doses of sodium pyruvate reduced signs of inflammation, enhanced systemic blood pressure, and ameliorated metabolic acidosis when administered in a prophylactic manner during endotoxemic shock. In the present study, we investigated whether low-dosed infusions of sodium pyruvate exhibited beneficial effects when applied therapeutically after the induction of systemic inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide was infused at a rate of 0. mg/kg × h over a period of 360 min to induce systemic inflammation in male Wistar rats. Sodium pyruvate (single dose 50 mg/kg × 15 min) was administered intravenously 180 and 270 min after starting of the lipopolysaccharide infusion. Systemic/vital parameters (e.g., systemic blood pressure and breathing rate) and blood/plasma parameters (e.g., acid-base parameters; electrolytes; glucose and lactate concentration; hemolysis; aminotransferase activities; and parameters of coagulation) were determined in regular intervals. Lipopolysaccharide infusion led to metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte as well as hemostatic disturbances, and hemolysis. Except for the acid-base status (amelioration of metabolic acidosis) and the plasma chloride concentration (reduction of hyperchloremia), the additional infusion of sodium pyruvate failed in significantly improving lipopolysaccharide-dependent alterations (e.g. vital, blood and plasma parameters). Protective effects of a delayed administration of the metabolizable anion pyruvate during systemic inflammation, hence, are limited to its function as alkalizer to counteract metabolic acidosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480421>Plasma Disappearance Rate of Indocyanine Green for Determination of Liver Function in Three Different Models of Shock.</a></h1><p>The measurement of the liver function via the plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green (PDR) is a sensitive bed-side tool in critical care. Yet, recent evidence has questioned the value of this method for hyperdynamic conditions. To evaluate this technique in different hemodynamic settings, we analyzed the PDR and corresponding pharmacokinetic models after  or hemorrhagic shock in rats. Male anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats underwent hemorrhage (mean arterial pressure 35 ±  mmHg, 90 min) and 2 h of reperfusion, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced moderate or severe (1.0 vs. 10 mg/kg)  for 6 h (each  = 6). Afterwards, PDR was measured, and pharmacokinetic models were analyzed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM). Hemorrhagic shock resulted in a significant decrease of PDR, compared with sham controls, and a corresponding attenuation of the calculated ICG clearance in 1- and 2-compartment models, with the same log-likelihood. The induction of severe, but not moderate , led to a significant reduction of PDR. The calculated ICG blood clearance was reduced in 1-compartment models for both septic conditions. 2-compartment models performed with a significantly better log likelihood, and the calculated clearance of ICG did not correspond well with PDR in both LPS groups. 3-compartment models did not improve the log likelihood in any experiment. These results demonstrate that PDR correlates well with ICG clearance in 1- and 2-compartment models after hemorrhage. In , best described by a 2-compartment model, PDR may not truly reflect the ICG clearance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30459055>Elevated high density lipoprotein cholesterol and low grade systemic inflammation is associated with increased gut permeability in normoglycemic men.</a></h1><p>Serum lipids and lipoproteins are established biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk that could be influenced by impaired gut barrier function via effects on the absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol. The aim of this study was to examine the potential relationship between gut barrier function (gut permeability) and concentration of serum lipids and lipoproteins, in an ancillary analysis of serum samples taken from a previous study.Serum lipids, lipoproteins and functional gut permeability, as assessed by the percentage of the urinary recovery of Cr-labelled EDTA absorbed within 24 h, were measured in a group of 30 healthy men. Serum lipopolysaccharide, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were also measured as markers of low-grade inflammation. The group expressed a -fold variation in total gut permeability (1.11-.03%). Gut permeability was unrelated to the concentration of both serum total and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, but was positively associated with serum high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (r = 0.434, P = 0.015). Serum HDL-cholesterol was also positively associated with serum  (r = 0.415, P = 0.023).The significant association between increased gut permeability and elevated serum HDL-cholesterol is consistent with the role of HDL as an acute phase reactant, and in this situation, potentially dysfunctional lipoprotein. This finding may have negative implications for the putative role of HDL as a cardio-protective lipoprotein.Copyright © 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Despite an improved understanding of this syndrome, numerous controversies still exist within the scientific and health professions regarding diagnosis, pathophysiology, risk factors, treatment and return to physical activity. This review examines the following eight controversies: 1) reliance on core temperature for diagnosing and assessing severity of EHS; 2) hypothalamic damage induces heat stroke and this mediates "thermoregulatory failure" during the immediate recovery period; 3) EHS is a predictable condition primarily due to overwhelming heat stress; 4) heat-induced  mediates systemic inflammatory response syndrome in all EHS cases; ) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for EHS prevention; 6) EHS shares similar mechanisms with malignant hyperthermia; 7) cooling to a specific body core temperature during treatment for EHS; and 8) return to physical activity based on physiological responses to a single exercise heat tolerance test. In this review, we present and discuss the origins and the evidence for each controversy and propose next steps to resolve the misconception.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28542000>Ketamine and Etomidate Down-regulate the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis in an Endotoxemic Mouse Model.</a></h1><p>We compared the effects of etomidate and ketamine on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during sepsis.Mice (n = /group) were injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (10 mg/kg) and 6 h later randomized to receive ketamine (100 mg/kg), etomidate (30 mg/kg), or saline. At two time points (12 and 48 h), messenger RNA levels of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone, pituitary proopiomelanocortin, and four adrenal enzymes (P450 side-chain cleavage, 3β-hydroxysteroid deshydrogenase, 21-hydroxylase, and 11β-hydroxylase) were measured by in situ hybridization (results are presented as optical density), and plasma levels of corticosterone and adrenocorticotropin hormones were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (mean ± SD).At 12 h, lipopolysaccharide induced an overexpression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (32 ±  vs. 18 ± 6, P < 0.01), proopiomelanocortin (21 ± 3 vs. 8 ± 0.9, P < 0.0001), P450 side-chain cleavage (32 ± 4 vs. 23 ± 10, P < 0.05), 21-hydroxylase (17 ±  vs. 12 ± 2, P < 0.05), and 11β-hydroxylase (11 ± 4 vs. 6 ± 0., P = 0.001), and an elevation of corticosterone (642 ± 165 vs. 98.3 ± 63 ng/ml, P < 0.0001). Etomidate and ketamine reduced P450 side-chain cleavage (19 ± 7 and 19 ± 3 vs. 32 ± 4, P < 0.01), 21-hydroxylase (8 ± 0.8 and 8 ± 1 vs. 17 ± , P < 0.001), 11β-hydroxylase (4 ± 0. and 7 ± 1 vs. 11 ± 4, P < 0.001 and P < 0.05), and corticosterone (413 ± 189 and 260 ± 161 vs. 642 ± 165 ng/ml, P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). Ketamine also inhibited adrenocorticotropin hormone production (2. ± 3.6 vs. 36 ± 15 pg/ml, P < 0.05). At 48 h, all four adrenal enzymes were down-regulated by lipopolysaccharide administration with corticosterone levels similar to the control group. Ketamine and etomidate did not modify corticosterone plasma levels.Our endotoxemic model induces an initial activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, followed by a secondary inhibition of adrenal steroidogenesis processes.

With this aim, rats were fed a high fat diet with % sucrose in the drinking water (HFS) for 7 months and then were fed for 1 month with HFS + % nopal (HFS + N). The composition of gut microbiota was assessed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Nopal modified gut microbiota and increased intestinal occludin-1 in the HFS + N group. This was associated with a decrease in metabolic , glucose insulinotropic peptide, glucose intolerance, lipogenesis, and metabolic inflexibility. These changes were accompanied by reduced hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress in adipose tissue and brain, and improved cognitive function, associated with an increase in B. fragilis.

Ten horses received aspirin orally in the morning with one loading dose of 4.7- mg/kg and maintenance doses of 1-1.3 mg/kg daily the following 4 days. Aggregometries (COLtest, ASPItest, ADPtest) and serum salicylic acid were measured. ASPItest showed significant difference in inhibition at 24 and 48 hr (p < .05) and 96 hr (p < .01). Significant change for ADPtest and COLtest couldn't be detected. Serum salicylic acid concentrations were significantly (p < .01) increased at 6 and 12 hr. Despite this, three horses failed any inhibitory effect of platelet function, suspecting an aspirin resistance. Regarding the other seven horses platelet aggregation induced by ASPItest was reduced between 37% and 100% from baseline at 6 and 12 hr and between 0 and 98% during the next 4 days. Correlations of serum concentration of salicylic acid and aggregometries couldn't be detected. It can be presumed that equine platelets are less susceptible to aspirin what may compromise eventually the anticoagulatory effects and efficacy in preventing and treating diseases with increased platelet activation as  or laminitis.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30463736>Loss of Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase Leads to Distinct Chronic Changes in Bone Phenotype.</a></h1><p>The gut is becoming increasingly recognized as the source of various systemic diseases, and recently, it has been linked to bone metabolism via the so-called gut-bone axis. The microbiome and gut-derived mediators are thought to impact upon bone metabolism, and administration of probiotics has been shown to have beneficial effects in bone. The gut brush border enzyme intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) plays an important role in controlling calcium absorption, inhibiting lipopolysaccharides, and other inflammatory mediators responsible for  and appears to preserve the normal gut microbiota. Interestingly, IAP-deficient mice (AKP3) also display a significant decrease in fecal Lactobacillus, the genus shown to be beneficial to bone.IAP mRNA levels in mouse bone were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Femurs of IAP-knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were analyzed by microcomputed tomography and histopathology. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and phosphorus were measured. Target cell response upon exposure to serum from IAP-KO and WT mice was quantified using primary bone marrow macrophages.IAP was not significantly expressed in bones of WT or KO animals. IAP (alkaline phosphatase 3) expression in bone was vanishingly low compared to the duodenum (bone versus duodenum, 56.9 ± 17.7 versus 25,430.3 ± 10,884. relative expression, P = 0.01). Bone histology of younger IAP-KO and WT animals was indistinguishable, whereas older IAP-deficient mice showed a distinctly altered phenotype on histology and computed tomography scan. Younger KO mice did not display any abnormal levels in blood chemistry. Older IAP-KO animals showed an isolated increase in serum alkaline phosphatase levels reflecting an environment of active bone formation (IAP-WT versus IAP-KO, 80 ± 27.4 U/I versus 453 ± 107. U/I, P = 0.004). There was no significant difference in serum calcium or phosphorus levels between KO and WT mice. Serum from IAP-KO mice induced a significantly higher inflammatory target cell response.Through its multiple functions, IAP seems to play a crucial role in connecting the gut to the bone. IAP deficiency leads to chronic changes in bone formation, most likely through dysbiosis and systemic dissemination of proinflammatory mediators.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In a day after the LPS injection, we studied endotoxin, corticosterone, sex steroids, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity levels in the serum; morphological disorders in the lung, liver, thymus, and spleen; ex vivo production of IL-2, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interferon γ (IFNγ) by splenic cells activated by ConA; and relative amount of T- and B-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood.After the injection of low-dose LPS, the serum endotoxin level increased only in males and was combined with a more pronounced inflammatory response in the lungs and thymus and an increase in ALT and AST activity levels without any changes in corticosterone level. After the injection of high-dose LPS, the inflammatory and pathological changes in the target organs manifested as severe  and sex differences of pathological changes in the lungs and liver were not revealed. The level of production of IL-2, IL-4, IFNγ, and TNF by splenic cells and the number of T-lymphocytes, including cytotoxic cells, in the peripheral blood, decreased in males, which is an evidence of a pronounced suppression of the immune response.We have shown that the morphofunctional changes in the organs of the immune system in females and males, as well as the intensity of the sex differences of inflammation, depend on the severity of systemic inflammatory response, induced by different doses of LPS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28611436>Antibacterial and detoxifying activity of NZ17074 analogues with multi-layers of selective antimicrobial actions against Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis.</a></h1><p>NZ17074 (N1), an arenicin-3 derivative isolated from the lugworm, has potent antibacterial activity and is cytotoxic. To reduce its cytotoxicity, seven N1 analogues with different structures were designed by changing their disulfide bonds, hydrophobicity, or charge. The "rocket" analogue-N2 and the "kite" analogue-N6 have potent activity and showed lower cytotoxicity in RAW264.7 cells than N1. The NMR spectra revealed that N1, N2, and N6 adopt β-sheet structures stabilized by one or two disulfide bonds. N2 and N6 permeabilized the outer/inner membranes of E. coli, but did not permeabilize the inner membranes of S. enteritidis. N2 and N6 induced E. coli and S. enteritidis cell cycle arrest in the I-phase and R-phase, respectively. In E. coli and in S. enteritidis, 18.7-43.8% of DNA/RNA/cell wall synthesis and .7-61.8% of DNA/RNA/protein synthesis were inhibited by the two peptides, respectively. Collapsed and filamentous E. coli cells and intact morphologies of S. enteritidis cells were observed after treatment with the two peptides. Body weight doses from 2.-7. mg/kg of N2 and N6 enhanced the survival rate of peritonitis- and -induced mice; reduced the serum IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α levels; and protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury. These data indicate that N2 and N6, through multiple selective actions, may be promising dual-function candidates as novel antimicrobial and anti-endotoxin peptides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29204871>Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Combat Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Sepsis in Rats via Amendment of P38-MAPK Signaling Cascade.</a></h1><p>Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory disorder which often occurs during extremely stressful conditions such as trauma, burn, shock, and infection. This study investigated the curative effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) against hepatic, renal, and pulmonary responses caused by a single administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 mg/kg, i.p) in rats. Treatment with BM-MSCs ( × 10 in 0.1 ml PBS, i.p.) 3 h after LPS antagonized the LPS-induced increment of the liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and kidney functions (BUN, sCr). BM-MSCs decreased tissue levels of P38-MAPK, NF-κB, STAT-3, TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, Bax together with elevation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the anti-apoptotic biomarker Bcl-2. Meanwhile, rats exhibited marked reduction of the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ. Interestingly, BM-MSCs normalized both broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) neutrophils count and lung wet/dry ratios.

Responses to intravenous bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) or normal saline were studied on three consecutive days in fetal sheep (LPS 1 μg/kg, n = ; normal saline n = ) and newborn lambs (LPS 2 μg/kg, n = 10; normal saline n = ). Cerebro-vascular function was assessed by monitoring cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) over 12 h each day, and inflammatory responses were assessed by plasma TNF alpha (TNF-α), nitrate and nitrite concentrations. Brain injury was quantified by counting both resting and active macrophages in the caudate nucleus and periventricular white matter (PVWM). An acute cerebral vasoconstriction (within 1 h of LPS injection) occurred in both the fetus (ΔCVR +53%) and newborn (ΔCVR +63%); subsequently prolonged cerebral vasodilatation occurred in the fetus (ΔCVR -33%) in association with double plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations, but not in the newborn. Abundant infiltration of activated macrophages was observed in both CN and PVWM at each age, with the extent being 2-3 times greater in the fetus (P < 0.001). In conclusion, while the fetus and newborn experience a similar acute disruption of the cerebral circulation after LPS, the fetus suffers a more prolonged circulatory disruption, a greater infiltration of activated macrophages, and an exaggerated susceptibility to brain injury.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the molecular regulation of this cytokine release is poorly characterized in humans. The time course of mRNA expression of 24 cytokines in circulating leukocytes was studied in a well-standardized model of human  (2 ng/kg). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to quantify the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible mRNA levels of leukocytes from 16 healthy volunteers in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Baseline mRNA levels of interleukins including IL-1α, IL-3, IL-, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte monocyte CSF (GM-CSF) were below detectable levels in normal blood of the healthy participants. After 2 h, LPS infusion increased median mRNA levels of IL-1α by >1100-fold and IL-1β and IL-8 by 33-fold and 46-fold, respectively. In contrast, levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and IL-10 mRNA increased by only 7-fold, whereas changes in mRNA expression of other cytokines showed either a more than two fold increase or were undetectable. In vitro incubation of whole blood with 50 pg/mL LPS for 2 h enhanced transcription levels of IL-1α mRNA by >10,000-fold, IL-6 and IL-12p40 by >1000-fold, IL-1β by 400-fold, TNF-α by 100-fold, IL-8, IL-18, interferon γ (IFN-γ) and G-CSF by >10-25-fold, and IL-10, IL-12p35, TNF-β, and IL-13 by 10-25-fold. Only half of the 24 evaluated cytokines were expressed at the mRNA level in circulating leukocytes under basal conditions and after an LPS challenge. Only IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-8, and TNF-α were upregulated in the circulating leukocytes, whereas several other cytokines (including IL-6 and G-CSF), were expressed on the mRNA level following in vitro incubation of blood with LPS.

The magnitude of the immune response is dependent on the strength of the external stimulus. Knowledge on leukocyte transcriptional responses altered in response to different stimulus dosages in man is lacking. Here, we sought to identify leukocyte transcriptional signatures dependent on LPS dose in humans. Healthy human volunteers were administered 1 ng/kg (n = 7), 2 ng/kg (n = 6), or 4 ng/kg (n = 7) LPS intravenously. Blood was collected before (pre-LPS) and 4 h after LPS administration. Total RNA was analyzed by microarrays and generalized linear models. Pathway analysis was performed by using Ingenuity pathway analysis. Leukocyte transcriptomes altered per LPS dosage were predominantly shared, with 47% common signatures relative to pre-LPS. A univariate linear model identified a set of 3736 genes that exhibited a dependency on differing LPS dosages. Neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts explained 38.9% of the variance in the LPS dose-dependent gene set. A multivariate linear model including leukocyte composition delineated a set of 295 genes with a dependency on LPS dose. Evaluation of the 295 gene signature in patients with sepsis due to abdominal infections showed significant correlations. Promoter regions of the LPS dose gene set were enriched for YY1, EGR1, ELK1, GABPA, KLF4, and REL transcription factor binding sites. Intravenous injection of 1, 2, or 4 ng/kg LPS was accompanied by both shared and distinct leukocyte transcriptional alterations.

However, it is unclear which specific processes underlying motivation are altered. We tested whether bacterial endotoxin E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affected two dissociable constructs of motivational behavior, ie, effort and reward sensitivity. After familiarization with  effort levels, participants made a series of accept/reject decisions on whether the stake offered (1, 4, 8, 12, or 15 apples) was 'worth the effort' (10%, 27.%, 45%, 62.%, and 80% of maximal voluntary contraction in a hand-held dynamometer). Effort and reward levels were parametrically modulated to dissociate their influence on choice. Overall, 29 healthy young males were administered LPS (2 ng/kg; n=14) or placebo (0.9% saline; n=15). The effort-stake task, and self-reported depression and fatigue were assessed prior to LPS/placebo injection, 2 and  h post injection. Cytokines and sickness symptoms were assessed hourly till 8 h after LPS injection. LPS transiently increased interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, sickness symptoms, body temperature and self-reported fatigue, and depression post injection relative to baseline and placebo. These changes were accompanied by LPS-induced decreases in acceptance rates of high-effort options, without significantly affecting reward sensitivity 2 h post injection, which were partially recovered  h post injection. We suggest that LPS-induced changes in motivation may be due to alterations to mesolimbic dopamine.

However, the results from studies measuring endotoxin in PD patients are discordant. We therefore measured systemic endotoxin in 55 PD outpatients attending for routine assessment of peritoneal membrane function; mean age 58.7 ± 16.4 years, 32 (58.2%) male, 21 (38.2%) diabetic, median duration of PD treatment 19. (13 - 31) months, 32 (58.2%) using 22.7 g/L dextrose dialysates, and 47 (85.%) icodextrin. The median systemic endotoxin concentration was 0.0485 (0.0043 - 0.103) Eu/mL. We found no association between endotoxin levels and patient demographics, markers of inflammation, serum albumin, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, extracellular volume measured by bioimpedance, blood pressure, PD prescriptions or peritoneal membrane transporter status, or medications. The measurement of endotoxin can be lowered by failure to effectively release protein-bound endotoxin prior to analysis and increased by contamination when taking blood samples and processing and storing the samples. Additionally, contamination with β-glucan from fungal cell walls and the use of different assays to analyze endotoxin can also give differing results. These factors may help to explain the disparate results reported in different studies. Our study would suggest that exposure to standard peritoneal dialysates does not substantially increase systemic endotoxin. However, until endotoxin assays can measure free and bound endotoxin separately, the role of endotoxin causing inflammation in PD patients remains to be determined.Copyright © 2018 International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29057473>Postoperative pharmacokinetics of meloxicam in horses after surgery for colic syndrome.</a></h1><p>NSAIDs are often used in horses with colic syndrome during the postoperative period, due to their ability to contrast  and to promote an analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect. As the pharmacokinetics of a drug are often modified in unhealthy animals compared to healthy subjects, the aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of meloxicam after i.v. administration in horses undergoing laparotomy for colic syndrome. Eight horses received 0.6 mg/kg of meloxicam i.v. towards the end of surgery. Blood samples were taken at scheduled time points during the following 24 hr. The serum concentration of the drug was determined by HPLC. Terminal half-life (6.88 ± 2.96 hr), volume of distribution at steady-state (186.53 ± 61.20 ml/Kg) and clearance (27.91 ± .72 ml kg hr ) were similar to those reported in literature for healthy horses. This result suggests that no adjustment of the approved dose should be necessary when meloxicam is used to treat horses in the immediate postoperative period after surgery for colic syndrome.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28525674>Continuous hemoadsorption with a cytokine adsorber during sepsis - a review of the literature.</a></h1><p>Sepsis is a well-recognized healthcare issue worldwide, ultimately resulting in significant mortality, morbidity and resource utilization during and after critical illness. In its most severe form, sepsis causes multi-organ dysfunction that produces a state of critical illness characterized by severe immune dysfunction and catabolism. Sepsis induces the activation of complement factor via 3 pathways and the release of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), resulting in a systemic inflammatory response. The inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide release induced by sepsis decrease systemic vascular resistance, resulting in profound hypotension. The combination of hypotension and microvascular occlusion results in tissue ischemia and ultimately leads to multiple organ failure. Several clinical and experimental studies have reported that treatment using adsorption of cytokines is beneficial during  and sepsis. This review article analyzes the efficacy of CytoSorb® adsorber in reducing the inflammatory response during sepsis. The CytoSorb® adsorber is known to have excellent adsorption rates for inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α. Studies have demonstrated that treatment with cytokine adsorbing columns has beneficial effects on the survival rate and inflammatory responses in animal septic models. Additionally, several cases have been reported in which treatment with cytokine adsorbing columns is very effective in hemodynamic stabilization and in preventing organ failure in critically ill patients. Although further investigations and clinical trials are needed, treatment with cytokine adsorbing columns may play an important role in the treatment of sepsis in the near future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29247356>Current and future pharmacological therapies for NAFLD/NASH.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease worldwide, and there is no approved pharmacotherapy. The efficacy of vitamin E and pioglitazone has been established in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a progressive form of NAFLD. GLP-1RA and SGLT2 inhibitors, which are currently approved for use in diabetes, have shown early efficacy in NASH, and also have beneficial cardiovascular or renal effects. Innovative NASH therapies include four main pathways. The first approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation. Medications in this approach include modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors (e.g., pemafibrate, elafibranor), medications targeting farnesoid X receptor axis [obeticholic acid; OCA)], inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, ACC inhibitor), and fibroblast growth factor-21 analogues. A second target is oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. This class of drug includes apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor and emricasan (an irreversible caspase inhibitor). A third target is intestinal microbiomes and metabolic . Several agents are in ongoing trials, including IMMe124, TLR4 antagonist, and solithromycin (macrolide antibiotics). The final target is hepatic fibrosis, which is strongly associated with all-cause or liver-related mortality in NASH. Antifibrotic agents are a cysteine-cysteine motif chemokine receptor-2/ antagonist (cenicriviroc; CVC) and galectin 3 antagonist. Among a variety of medications in development, four agents such as OCA, elafibranor, ASK1 inhibitor, and CVC are currently being evaluated in an international phase 3 trial for the treatment of NASH. Within the next few years, the availability of therapeutic options for NASH will hopefully curb the rising trend of NASH-related diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28487809>The Level of Oxidative Neutrophil Response When Determining Endotoxin Activity Assay: A New Biomarker for Defining the Indications and Effectiveness of Intensive Care in Patients with Sepsis.</a></h1><p>. To analyse the clinical informativity of the neutrophil oxidative response level ("Response") during an Endotoxin Activity Assay (EAA) as a new biomarker defining the indications and effectiveness of intensive care in cardiac surgical patients with septic complications. . Blood samples were taken from 198 adult patients who were admitted to the ICU after cardiac surgery (SIRS: 34, MODS: 36, and sepsis: 128). The composite of laboratory studies included CRP, PCT, EAA with "Response" level, and presepsin. . 83% of patients had a "normal" neutrophil response, 12% of patients had a low neutrophil response, and % of patients had a critically low neutrophil response. Patients with critically low responses had the lowest values of the EAA and the highest concentrations of PSP and D-dimer ( < 0.05). . EAA results should be interpreted with the level of neutrophil response. "Response" > 0. has a negative predictive value; the EAA < 0.6 at "Response" < 0. may indicate a high level of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30095297>-enhanced renal vascular reactivity to endothelin-1 in cirrhotic rats.</a></h1><p>Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a severe complication of advanced cirrhosis, is defined as hypoperfusion of kidneys resulting from intense renal vasoconstriction in response to generalized systemic arterial vasodilatation. Nevertheless, the mechanisms have been barely investigated. Cumulative studies demonstrated renal vasodilatation in portal hypertensive and compensated cirrhotic rats. Previously, we identified that blunted renal vascular reactivity of portal hypertensive rats was reversed after lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This study was therefore conducted to delineate the sequence of renal vascular alternation and underlying mechanisms in LPS-treated cirrhotic rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to receive sham surgery (Sham) or common bile duct ligation (CBDL). LPS was induced on the 28th day after surgery. Kidney perfusion was performed at 0. or 3 h after LPS to evaluate renal vascular response to endothelin-1 (ET-1).  increased serum ET-1 levels ( P < 0.0001) and renal arterial blood flow ( P < 0.05) in both Sham and CBDL rats. CBDL rats showed enhanced renal vascular reactivity to ET-1 at 3 h after LPS ( P = 0.026). Pretreatment with endothelin receptor type A (ET) antagonist abrogated the LPS-enhanced renal vascular response in CBDL rats ( P < 0.001). There were significantly lower inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression but higher ET and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) expressions in renal medulla of endotoxemic CBDL rats ( P < 0.05). We concluded that LPS-induced renal iNOS inhibition, ET upregulation, and subsequent ERK signaling activation may participate in renal vascular hyperreactivity in cirrhosis. ET-1-targeted therapy may be feasible in the control of HRS. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) occurred in advanced cirrhosis after large-volume paracentesis or bacterial peritonitis. We demonstrated that intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced renal vascular reactivity to endothelin-1 (ET-1) in cirrhotic rats, accompanied by inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibition, endothelin receptor type A (ET) upregulation, and subsequent extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in renal medulla. Pretreatment with ET antagonist abrogated the LPS-enhanced renal vascular response in common bile duct ligation rats. These findings suggest that further clinical investigation of ET-1-targeted therapy may be feasible in the control of HRS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30141207>Effects of Endotoxin on Type 3 Inositol 1,4,-Trisphosphate Receptor in Human Cholangiocytes.</a></h1><p>Clinical conditions that result in , such as sepsis and alcoholic hepatitis (AH), often are accompanied by cholestasis. Although hepatocellular changes in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have been well characterized, less is known about whether and how cholangiocytes contribute to this form of cholestasis. We examined effects of endotoxin on expression and function of the type 3 inositol trisphosphate receptor (ITPR3), because this is the main intracellular Ca release channel in cholangiocytes, and loss of it impairs ductular bicarbonate secretion. Bile duct cells expressed the LPS receptor, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which links to activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Analysis of the human ITPR3 promoter revealed five putative response elements to NF-κB, and promoter activity was inhibited by p65/p50. Nested 0.- and 1.0-kilobase (kb) deletion fragments of the ITPR3 promoter were inhibited by NF-κB subunits. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that NF-κB interacts with the ITPR3 promoter, with an associated increase in H3K9 methylation. LPS decreased ITPR3 mRNA and protein expression and also decreased sensitivity of bile duct cells to calcium agonist stimuli. This reduction was reversed by inhibition of TLR4. ITPR3 expression was decreased or absent in cholangiocytes from patients with cholestasis of sepsis and from those with severe AH. Conclusion: Stimulation of TLR4 by LPS activates NF-κB to down-regulate ITPR3 expression in human cholangiocytes. This may contribute to the cholestasis that can be observed in conditions such as sepsis or AH.© 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884590>Galacto-oligosaccharides ameliorate dysbiotic Bifidobacteriaceae decline in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.</a></h1><p>Gut microbiota affects the host's metabolism, and it is suggested that there are differences in gut microbiota composition between patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy individuals. Additionally, dysbiosis may increase the concentration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), causing metabolic , which induces impaired glucose tolerance. Several studies have reported relationships between metabolic diseases and the gut microbiota; and prebiotics, such as oligosaccharides, are commonly consumed to regulate gut microbiotas in healthy individuals. Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) are a major prebiotic, which specifically increase Bifidobacteriaceae abundance. Recent studies have reported that Bifidobacteriaceae improved metabolic  or impaired glucose tolerance. However, there are few studies reporting the effects of GOS on patients with type 2 diabetes. In the current study, we compared clinical parameters, faecal gut microbiota, their associated metabolic products and their components such as LPS, and LPS-binding protein (LBP) produced by the host, between patients with diabetes and healthy controls. We then assessed the effects of GOS on glycaemic control, and gut microbiotas and metabolites in patients with type 2 diabetes in a double-blind controlled manner. LBP levels were significantly higher in patients with diabetes than those of healthy subjects, which was consistent with previous reports. The abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae and the diversity of intestinal microbiota were significantly lower in patients with diabetes than in healthy subjects. Interestingly, Bifidobacteriaceae was markedly restored in patients with diabetes after consumption of GOS, whereas LBP and glucose tolerance did not improve during this short-term trial period. In the present study, we demonstrated that GOS can ameliorate dysbiosis in patients with diabetes, and continuous intake of GOS may be a promising method for managing type 2 diabetes.</p></html>
