Linoleic  and  both give rise to other long-chain fatty  derivatives, including gamma- and arachidonic  (omega-6 fatty acids) and docosahexaenoic  and eicosapentaenoic  (omega-3 fatty acids). These fatty acids are showing promise as safe adjunctive treatments for many skin disorders, including atopic dermatitis, , acne vulgaris, systemic lupus erythematosus, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and melanoma. Their roles are diverse and include maintenance of the stratum corneum permeability barrier, maturation and differentiation of the stratum corneum, formation and secretion of lamellar bodies, inhibition of proinflammatory eicosanoids, elevation of the sunburn threshold, inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-12), inhibition of lipoxygenase, promotion of wound healing, and promotion of apoptosis in malignant cells, including melanoma. They fulfill these functions independently and through the modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and Toll-like receptors.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Addition of GLA in vitro suppresses release of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) from human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS-induced IL-1beta release is followed by IL-1-induced IL-1beta release, an amplification process termed "autoinduction." We show here, using IL-1alpha stimulation to simulate autoinduction, that administration of GLA to healthy volunteers and to patients with inflammatory arthritis reduces LPS-induced IL-1beta secretion mainly by reducing autoinduction of IL-1beta. GLA reduces LPS-induced pro-IL-1beta mRNA modestly and IL-la-induced pro-IL-1beta gene expression markedly. In addition to reducing amplification of IL-1beta, GLA increases the amount of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) secreted from stimulated cells, thereby facilitating an increase in the secreted IL-1Ra/IL-1beta ratio. IL-1beta is important to host defense, but the amplification mechanism may be excessive in genetically predisposed individuals. Thus, reduction of IL-1beta autoinduction may be protective in some patients with endotoxic shock and with diseases characterized by chronic inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29426270>Evening primrose oil and labour, is it effective? A randomised clinical trial.</a></h1><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of evening primrose oil (EvPO) on the duration of pregnancy and labour. The study was performed as a triple blind placebo controlled randomised clinical trial on nulliparous low-risk women with a certain gestational age of 40 weeks of pregnancy and a Bishop score of less than 4. In the case group (EvPO group), EvPO capsules were administered, 1000 mg, twice daily, for 7 days, and in the control group, placebo was administered similarly. The women of the two groups were followed up to delivery. In total, 80 women finished the study (40 in each group). The women of the two groups did not have significant differences according to age, BMI, Bishop Score at the beginning of the study, gestational age at entering the study, employment status and education level, the number of capsules used and duration of using medications. There was no significant difference between the two groups according to gestational age at delivery, need for induction or augmentation of labour, duration of different stages of labour, neonatal weight and Apgar scores, and the indications for hospital admission. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Evening primrose oil has been used for the treatment of systemic disorders, which are accompanied with chronic inflammation such as atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and . Also, it has been proposed for some women's health conditions including breast pain (mastalgia), symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and menopausal symptoms, cervical ripening and induction or augmentation of labour. What do the results of this study add? Evening primrose oil does not have any impact on Bishop Score and the duration of different stages of labour. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? According to the present study and the other performed studies, there is not enough evidence confirming effectiveness of Evening primrose oil for cervical ripening and duration of labour. It is suggested that pending further data its usage should be limited to experimental RCTs and its use in clinical practice should be prevented. Also, different routes of administration and different dosages should be investigated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4096537>The fatty- spectrum in plasma and adipose tissue in patients with .</a></h1><p>The long-chained fatty acids, which are precursors of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, were examined in plasma lipid esters and adipose tissue obtained from 20 male psoriatic patients and 36 matched controls. The fatty- composition of the plasma lipid esters (cholesterol esters, triglycerides and phospholipids) and adipose tissue was assayed using thin-layer and gas chromatography. In comparison with healthy controls, the patients' plasma lipid esters contained significantly lower levels of linoleic  (18:2 omega 6) and  (18:3 omega 3), and higher levels of dihomo-gamma- (20:3 omega 6). In the adipose tissue of the patients, the amount of  was significantly decreased, while that of arachidonic  (20:4 omega 6) was increased. The observed changes were more pronounced in patients with severe  than in those with a milder form of the disease. Our results suggest that psoriatic patients differ from healthy controls with regard to the distribution of several of the essential long-chained fatty acids involved in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The relevance of these findings to the development of  remains to be established.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8066104>The fern Polypodium decumanum, used in the treatment of , and its fatty  constituents as inhibitors of leukotriene B4 formation.</a></h1><p>The fern Polypodium decumanum, commonly called Calaguala, has a clinically documented use in South America and Spain in the treatment of . One of the inflammatory mediators isolated in abnormally high quantities in the psoriatic skin is leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Calaguala was tested in an in vitro model using human leukocytes for its ability to inhibit the LTB4 formation. The inhibition was found to be caused by the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) linoleic,  and arachidonic . IC50 values were determined for the isolated acids and compared to a group of closely related acids also commonly found in nature. The IC50 values for most acids tested were of the same magnitude (20-60 microM) except for arachidonic  which showed stimulatory activity and 8(R) hydroxylinoleic  which gave 30% inhibition with the highest dose tested (120 microM). The amounts of PUFAs in different Calaguala extracts were quantitatively analysed and it is concluded that the fatty  constituents of Calaguala may contribute to the clinical effects of the extract.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9083074>A heterocomplex formed by the calcium-binding proteins MRP8 (S100A8) and MRP14 (S100A9) binds unsaturated fatty acids with high affinity.</a></h1><p>We show that unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) bind reversibly and with high affinity to a heterocomplex of 34 kDa (FA-p34) formed by the non-covalent association of two calcium-binding proteins of the S100 family: MRP8 (S100A8) and MRP14 (S100A9). Fatty -competition studies on the [3H]oleic .FA-p34-complex show that oleic, alpha-linoleic, gamma-, and arachidonic acids have IC50 values of about 1 microM, whereas palmitic and stearic acids are poor competitors. The binding of arachidonic  is saturable with a single class of binding site per FA-p34, and a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.13 microM is calculated. The individual subunits MRP8 and MRP14 show no binding properties for fatty acids, whereas a p34 complex reconstituted in vitro by the recombinant molecules exhibits binding properties, suggesting that the fatty -binding site of FA-p34 is created through heterocomplex formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that lowering free Ca2+ levels to 16 nM results in a loss of the fatty -binding capacity of purified FA-p34. In calcium-induced differentiating keratinocytes, the amounts of FA-p34 are increased in the particulate (2.0 +/- 0.5 pmol of [3H]oleic /mg protein) and in the cytosolic (4.5 +/- 0.6 pmol of [3H]oleic /mg protein) fractions, whereas no FA-p34 can be detected in non-differentiated cultured keratinocytes. In abnormally differentiated keratinocytes () and in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, FA-p34 is highly expressed (31.35 +/- 1.6 and 349.8 +/- 17.9 pmol of [3H]oleic /mg protein, respectively), pointing toward a role for this heteromer in mediating effects of unsaturated fatty acids in a calcium-dependent way during cell differentiation and/or inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2913961>Implications of dietary oils and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the management of cutaneous disorders.</a></h1><p>A major proinflammatory metabolite of arachidonic , leukotriene B4, is known to accumulate in the lesions of . Most of this metabolite is biosynthesized by the polymorphonuclear cells that infiltrate into the psoriatic lesions. Epidermal 15-lipoxygenase, on the other hand, metabolizes arachidonic  into 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-20:4n-6), presumably serving as a negative feedback to inhibit the local generation of leukotriene B4. Eicosapentaenoic , a major polyunsaturated fatty  in fish oil, and gamma-, a poly-unsaturated fatty  in certain vegetable oils, are both metabolized by epidermal 15-lipoxygenase into 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic  (15-OH-20:5n-3) and 15-hydroxyeicosatriaenoic  (15-OH-20:3n-3), respectively. Both of these monohydroxy acids are potent in vitro inhibitors of leukotriene B4 generation. It seems reasonable, therefore, that adequate dietary supplementation with eicosapentaenoic  or gamma- may offer a novel and nontoxic approach to suppressing cutaneous inflammatory disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3096409>The inflammatory response of rabbit skin to topical arachidonic  and its pharmacological modulation.</a></h1><p>The inflammatory reaction induced by the intradermal injection of arachidonic  into the rabbit dermis has been investigated. Plasma extravasation was measured by the leakage of 125I-albumin into the tissues and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) accumulation was assessed histologically. Arachidonic, 5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic and 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acids, but not oleic, linoleic or  acids, caused a concentration-related plasma extravasation following their intra-dermal injection. The plasma extravasation induced by arachidonic  was dependent on PMNLs. PMNL infiltration and plasma extravasation into arachidonic -injected skin sites was inhibited by the mixed cyclo-oxygenase-lipoxygenase inhibitor, BW755C. Arachidonic -induced plasma extravasation was inhibited by cyclo-oxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors but not by the Paf antagonist, kadsurenone. The inflammation induced by arachidonic  in the rabbit dermis may be a useful model for evaluating 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors which could be potentially useful anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of  and other inflammatory diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10617996>Evening primrose oil and borage oil in rheumatologic conditions.</a></h1><p>Diets rich in arachidonic  (20:4n-6) lead to the formation of 2-series prostaglandins (PGs) and 4-series leukotrienes (LTs), with proinflammatory effects. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are used in rheumatoid arthritis to inhibit cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase), thereby decreasing production of 2-series PGs. Lipoxygenase activity remains intact, however, allowing LT production (eg, synthesis of LTB(4), a potent inflammatory mediator) to continue. Altering the essential fatty  (EFA) content of the diet can modify some of these effects. Ingestion of a diet rich in evening primrose oil elevates concentrations of dihomo-gamma- (DGLA; 20:3n-6), which results in the production of 1-series PGs, eg, PGE(1). DGLA itself cannot be converted to LTs but can form a 15-hydroxyl derivative that blocks the transformation of arachidonic  to LTs. Increasing DGLA intake may allow DGLA to act as a competitive inhibitor of 2-series PGs and 4-series LTs and thus suppress inflammation. The results of in vitro and animal work evaluating EFAs in inflammatory situations are encouraging, which has stimulated clinical workers to evaluate these compounds in rheumatoid arthritis. Several well-controlled, randomized clinical studies have now been completed in which various EFAs were evaluated as treatments. The results of most of these studies suggest some clinical benefit to these treatments; these data are reviewed here.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15771229>Vitamin D3-based conjugates for topical treatment of : synthesis, antiproliferative activity, and cutaneous penetration studies.</a></h1><p>The goals of the experiments reported in this paper were to explore skin bioavailability and cell growth inhibitory activity of new vitamin D3-based conjugates studied as a potential drug complex for .Conjugation was made between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as  or gamma-, and calcipotriol--a vitamin D3 analogue clinically used for topical treatment of . These complexes were prepared by coupling the corresponding fatty  with calcipotriol in the presence of dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide (DCC) and 4-(dimethylamino)-pyridine (DMAP) to obtain an ester bond.The conjugates were capable of enhancing the penetration of the vitamin into the skin as well as inhibiting proliferation of keratinocytes in cultures. The antiproliferative activity even increased after simulating the full hydrolysis of the conjugates. In vitro skin penetration studies revealed that the conjugates penetrated into the skin at higher levels relative to calcipotriol alone. It was also demonstrated that the conjugate containing n-3 fatty  penetrated into the skin at higher levels as compared to the conjugate containing n-6 PUFA. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis has shown that after penetration, a major portion of calcipotriol-PUFA conjugate was first converted mainly into another isomer form, presumably by transesterification, and only then it was hydrolyzed to form apparently high local concentrations of both calcipotriol and PUFA.The unique biotransformation that occurred after penetration into the skin indicates that these conjugates are mutual prodrugs that are able to be bioprocessed in the skin and fully converted to the parent therapeutic agents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12480795>Omega-3 fatty acids in inflammation and autoimmune diseases.</a></h1><p>Among the fatty acids, it is the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) which possess the most potent immunomodulatory activities, and among the omega-3 PUFA, those from fish oil-eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)--are more biologically potent than  (ALA). Some of the effects of omega-3 PUFA are brought about by modulation of the amount and types of eicosanoids made, and other effects are elicited by eicosanoid-independent mechanisms, including actions upon intracellular signaling pathways, transcription factor activity and gene expression. Animal experiments and clinical intervention studies indicate that omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and, therefore, might be useful in the management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Coronary heart disease, major depression, aging and cancer are characterized by an increased level of interleukin 1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine. Similarly, arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and lupus erythematosis are autoimmune diseases characterized by a high level of IL-1 and the proinflammatory leukotriene LTB(4) produced by omega-6 fatty acids. There have been a number of clinical trials assessing the benefits of dietary supplementation with fish oils in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in humans, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, , lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and migraine headaches. Many of the placebo-controlled trials of fish oil in chronic inflammatory diseases reveal significant benefit, including decreased disease activity and a lowered use of anti-inflammatory drugs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2566241>Dietary supplementation with a combination of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids (super gamma-oil marine) improves .</a></h1><p> may improve during dietary supplementation with fish oil containing n-3 fatty acids including eicosapentaenoic .

We examined the potential benefit of Efamol Marine, a combination of evening primrose oil and fish oil in the treatment of 38 patients with PsA. Patients with PsA were entered in a double-blind placebo controlled study and received either 12 Efamol Marine capsules or 12 placebo capsules daily for 9 months. All patients received placebo capsules for a further 3 months. At month 3 of the study patients were asked to reduce their intake of NSAIDs and maintain that decrease provided there was no worsening of their joint symptoms. Clinical assessments of skin and joint disease severity and activity were performed at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. All measures of skin disease activity including severity, percentage body affected and itch were unchanged by Efamol Marine. The NSAID requirement remained the same between both treatment groups. In addition, there was no change demonstrated in the activity of arthritis as measured by duration of morning stiffness. Ritchie articular index, number of active joints, ESR and CRP. However, a rise in serum TXB2 was observed in the active group during the placebo phase; in addition a fall in leukotriene B4 production occurred during the active phase period followed by a marked rise during the placebo phase suggesting some laboratory documented anti-inflammatory effect. In conclusion, this study suggests that Efamol Marine may alter prostaglandin metabolism in patients with PsA, although it did not produce a clinical improvement and did not allow reduction in NSAID requirement.

The amount of DHA necessary to maintain normal amounts of the liver and brain phospholipids postnatally is 11 mg/kg daily. Elderly patients on long-term gastric tube feedings and others on long-term intravenous fluids and on total parenteral nutrition are particularly prone to deficiencies of , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and DHA. The amounts estimated to prevent deficiencies in the elderly are 800-1100 mg/d of  and 300-400 mg/d of EPA and DHA combined. Preliminary data indicate that children with malnutrition and mucoviscidosis, women with toxemia, and elderly people have decreased amounts of DHA in plasma phospholipids. The omega 3 fatty acids lower triglycerides and, at high levels, lower cholesterol. The anti-aggregatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of omega 3 fatty acids have been confirmed, and a dose-response curve is emerging. Despite the increase in bleeding time, no clinical evidence of bleeding has been noted by the investigators in any of the studies.

Of the fatty acids applied to the skin only eicosapentaenoic and arachidonic acids (EPA; AA) produced consistent, measurable erythema. The monohydroxy derivatives of the two fatty acids also caused erythema, the 12-hydroxy isomers being the most potent. Chemokinetic activity towards PMNs was observed in the presence of AA, EPA and  using an agarose microdroplet chemokinesis assay. In contrast to their in vivo properties, the 5-hydroxy isomers of AA and EPA were the most potent, being approximately 10 times more chemokinetically active than the other isomers. Quantification of the hydroxyeicosatetraenoic and hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids (HETEs; HEPEs) in the lesional skin of psoriatic patients demonstrated that, of the metabolites measured, 12-HETE was present in the greatest amounts. Twenty five times more 12-HETE than 12- or 15-HEPE was detected, these being the most abundant of the HEPEs formed. The monohydroxy derivatives of AA and EPA may contribute to the inflammatory changes observed in .

Some plants belonging to the genus  L. are characterized by biological activity. Therefore, studies were conducted to determine the dependence of biological activity on the chemical composition of various parts of the evening primrose, mainly leaves, stems, and seeds. Common components of all parts of the  plants are fatty acids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. In contrast, primrose seeds also contain proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. Therefore, it is believed that the most interesting sources of biologically active compounds are the seeds and, above all, evening primrose seed oil. This oil contains mainly aliphatic alcohols, fatty acids, sterols, and polyphenols. Evening primrose oil (EPO) is extremely high in linoleic  (LA) (70⁻74%) and γ- (GLA) (8⁻10%), which may contribute to the proper functioning of human tissues because they are precursors of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. EPO supplementation results in an increase in plasma levels of γ- and its metabolite dihomo-γ- (DGLA). This compound is oxidized by lipoxygenase (15-LOX) to 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic  (15-HETrE) or, under the influence of cyclooxygenase (COX), DGLA is metabolized to series 1 prostaglandins. These compounds have anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties. Furthermore, 15-HETrE blocks the conversion of arachidonic  (AA) to leukotriene A₄ (LTA₄) by direct inhibition of 5-LOX. In addition, γ- suppresses inflammation mediators such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and cytokine - tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The beneficial effects of EPO have been demonstrated in the case of atopic dermatitis, , Sjögren's syndrome, asthma, and anti-cancer therapy.</p></html>
