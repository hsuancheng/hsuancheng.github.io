<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26301204>Immunotherapy of Childhood Sarcomas.</a></h2><p>Pediatric sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors of bone and soft tissue origin. Although more than 100 different histologic subtypes have been described, the majority of pediatric cases belong to the Ewing's family of tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma. Most patients that present with localized stage are curable with surgery and/or chemotherapy; however, those with metastatic disease at diagnosis or those who experience a relapse continue to have a very poor prognosis. New therapies for these patients are urgently needed. Immunotherapy is an established treatment modality for both liquid and solid tumors, and in pediatrics, most notably for neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. In the past, immunomodulatory agents such as interferon, interleukin-2, and liposomal-muramyl tripeptide phosphatidyl- have been tried, with some activity seen in subsets of patients; additionally, various cancer vaccines have been studied with possible benefit. Monoclonal antibody therapies against tumor antigens such as disialoganglioside GD2 or   targets such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 are being actively explored in pediatric sarcomas. Building on the success of adoptive T  therapy for EBV-related lymphoma, strategies to redirect T cells using chimeric antigen receptors and bispecific antibodies are rapidly evolving with potential for the treatment of sarcomas. This review will focus on recent preclinical and clinical developments in targeted agents for pediatric sarcomas with emphasis on the immunobiology of  , immunoediting, tumor microenvironment, antibody engineering,  engineering, and tumor vaccines. The future integration of antibody-based and -based therapies into an overall treatment strategy of sarcoma will be discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29479349>Adrenergic Signaling: A Targetable  Limiting Development of the Antitumor  Response.</a></h2><p>An  response must be tightly controlled so that it will be commensurate with the level of response needed to protect the organism without damaging normal tissue. The roles of cytokines and chemokines in orchestrating these processes are well known, but although stress has long been thought to also affect  responses, the underlying mechanisms were not as well understood. Recently, the role of nerves and, specifically, the sympathetic nervous system, in regulating  responses is being revealed. Generally, an acute stress response is beneficial but chronic stress is detrimental because it suppresses the activities of effector  cells while increasing the activities of immunosuppressive cells. In this review, we first discuss the underlying biology of adrenergic signaling in cells of both the innate and adaptive  system. We then focus on the effects of chronic adrenergic stress in promoting tumor growth, giving examples of effects on tumor cells and  cells, explaining the methods commonly used to induce stress in preclinical mouse models. We highlight how this relates to our observations that mandated housing conditions impose baseline chronic stress on mouse models, which is sufficient to cause chronic immunosuppression. This problem is not commonly recognized, but it has been shown to impact conclusions of several studies of mouse physiology and mouse models of disease. Moreover, the fact that preclinical mouse models are chronically immunosuppressed has critical ramifications for analysis of any experiments with an  component. Our group has found that reducing adrenergic stress by housing mice at thermoneutrality or treating mice housed at cooler temperatures with β-blockers reverses immunosuppression and significantly improves responses to  inhibitor immunotherapy. These observations are clinically relevant because there are numerous retrospective epidemiological studies concluding that cancer patients who were taking β-blockers have better outcomes. Clinical trials testing whether β-blockers can be repurposed to improve the efficacy of traditional and immunotherapies in patients are on the horizon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25950475>Platelet-activating factor induces   arrest and disrupts the DNA damage response in mast cells.</a></h2><p>Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent phospholipid modulator of inflammation that has diverse physiological and pathological functions. Previously, we demonstrated that PAF has an essential role in ultraviolet (UV)-induced immunosuppression and reduces the repair of damaged DNA, suggesting that UV-induced PAF is contributing to skin cancer initiation by inducing  suppression and also affecting a proper DNA damage response. The exact role of PAF in modulating  proliferation, differentiation or transformation is unclear. Here, we investigated the mechanism(s) by which PAF affects the   and impairs early DNA damage response. PAF arrests proliferation in transformed and nontransformed human mast cells by reducing the expression of cyclin-B1 and promoting the expression of p21. PAF-treated cells show a dose-dependent   arrest mainly at G2-M, and a decrease in the DNA damage response elements MCPH1/BRIT-1 and ataxia telangiectasia and rad related (ATR). In addition, PAF disrupts the localization of p-ataxia telangiectasia mutated (p-ATM), and phosphorylated-ataxia telangiectasia and rad related (p-ATR) at the site of DNA damage. Whereas the potent effect on   arrest may imply a tumor suppressor activity for PAF, the impairment of proper DNA damage response might implicate PAF as a tumor promoter. The outcome of these diverse effects may be dependent on specific cues in the microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29635124>Phosphoethanolamine induces caspase-independent  death by reducing the expression of C-RAF and inhibits tumor growth in human melanoma model.</a></h2><p>Phosphoethanolamine (PEA) is a fundamental precursor during the biosynthesis of  membranes phospholipids. In the past few years, it has been described as a potential antitumor agent. In previous studies, we demonstrated that PEA showed antitumor properties in vitro and in vivo in a wide range of tumor  lines. Herein, we showed that PEA possesses cytotoxic properties and notably revealed to induce caspase-independent  death. Of interest, we provided evidence that PEA inhibits melanoma cells proliferation through the reduction of C-RAF. Molecular docking of PEA evidenced that this compound indeed fits satisfactory in the binding site located between the dimers of C-RAF protein with 107,01 Å and score of -29,62. Also, PEA arrested A2058 cells at G2/M phase in the  . Moreover,  proliferation, migration and adhesion capacities of A2058 cells were also inhibited by PEA. Most importantly, PEA inhibited tumor growth of melanoma tumors and prolonged survival rate of mice. Also, PEA induced a significant  response in a syngeneic metastatic melanoma model. Taken together, these data indicate that PEA is a promising candidate for future developments in cancer field.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.</p></html>
