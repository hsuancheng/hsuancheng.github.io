The results showed that the  decrease rates of BBP, BBP-8, BBP-16, and BBP-24 were 77.48, 69.61, 56.87, and 52.89%, respectively. The antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of BBPs were decreased under gastrointestinal condition, which might be due to the variation of  during digestion. The bile acid-binding ability of BBPs showed an -dependent manner for higher  polysaccharides with higher viscosity. Through fermentation, the BBPs affected the ecosystem of the intestinal tract by promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids, lowering the pH of colon, and decreasing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. All BBPs showed almost a similar modulation effect on the gut bacteria, but the lower  polysaccharide was more easily utilized by bacteria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667426>Oregano: A potential prophylactic treatment for the intestinal .</a></h1><p>Prophylactic use of antibiotics in poultry diets has been identified as a problematic practice because of its potential to exacerbate the spread of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens. A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by  profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in weight gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain fatty acids. The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the liver in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671720>The Human Milk  is Modulated by Maternal Diet.</a></h1><p>Human milk microorganisms contribute not only to the healthy development of the immune system in infants, but also in shaping the gut .

A total of 342, 26-d-old Cobb500 broilers were divided into 5 groups with 6 replicates. Treatments were as follows: (a) Low stocking density (L, 9 birds per cage); (b) High stocking density (H, 12 birds per cage); (c) H + 50 ppm NAM; (d) H + 500 ppm BA; (e) H + 50 ppm NAM + 500 ppm BA (COMB). The results showed that high stocking density significantly reduced the feed intake and body weight gain of broilers, while COMB improved the growth performance at high stocking density. High stocking density significantly reduced the liver metallothionein content, liver mitochondrial membrane potential and the activities of Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase. In contrast, the liver metallothionein contents in the NAM, BA and COMB fed group were higher than those in the H group. COMB increased the activity of ATPase as well, but it failed to enhance the mitochondrial membrane potential. Stocking density also affected gut  of broilers. The high-density group increased the relative abundance of Blautia. Supplementation of BA and NAM increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, respectively. In conclusion, a combination of NAM and BA can improve the performance, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial function and intestinal  of broilers at high stocking density.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655872>Phyllosphere of Submerged Plants in Bathing Lakes as a Reservoir of Fungi-Potential Human Pathogens.</a></h1><p>This study analysed whether the littoral zone in the immediate vicinity of bathing sites retains potentially pathogenic yeasts on the phyllosphere surface and to what extent the species composition of microfungi in the phyllosphere and in surface waters is similar. The research was carried out in selected lakes located within the administrative boundaries of the city of Olsztyn, the largest city in the Masurian Lake District (NE Poland). The experiment was conducted in three summer seasons near bathing sites in three lakes, which are the most popular as recreational sites (Lake Kortowskie, Lake Tyrsko, and Lake Skanda). Microfungi isolated from the phyllosphere of 13 plant species of the littoral zone from dropped leaves of coast plants with no disease symptoms were used as the study material. The isolated fungi were identified in accordance with the accepted diagnostic procedures applied in mycological laboratories. A total of 36 yeast species of 16 genera were identified. Fungi found earlier at the bathing sites of the lakes were identified in 60% of the cases. Nine species were categorised as class BSL-2 fungi.

We then describe how this model is parameterized based on published  data. Finally, we investigate how treatment history affects the prevalence of resistance among opportunistic enterobacterial pathogens. We simulate treatment histories and identify which properties of prior antibiotic exposure are most influential in determining the prevalence of resistance. We find that resistance prevalence can be predicted by 3 properties, namely the total days of drug exposure, the duration of the drug-free period after last treatment, and the center of mass of the treatment pattern. Overall this work provides a framework for capturing the role of the microbiome in the selection of antibiotic resistance and highlights the role of treatment history for the prevalence of resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665423>Identification of Metagenomics Structure and Function Associated With Temporal Changes in Rat (Rattus norvegicus) Skin Microbiome During Health and Cutaneous Burn.</a></h1><p>The cutaneous skin microbiome is host to a vast ensemble of resident microbes that provide essential capabilities including protection of skin barrier integrity and modulation of the host immune response. Cutaneous burn-injury promotes alteration of cutaneous and systemic immune response that can affect both commensal and pathogenic microbes. A cross-sectional study of a limited number of burn patients revealed a difference in the bacteriome of burned versus control participants. Temporal changes of the skin microbiome during health and cutaneous burn-injury remains largely unknown. Furthermore, how this microbial shift relates to community function in the collective metagenome remain elusive. Due to cost considerations and reduced healing time, rodents are frequently used in burn research, despite inherent physiological differences between rodents and human skin. Using a rat burn model, a longitudinal study was conducted to characterize the rat skin bacterial residents and associated community functions in states of health (n = 30) (sham-burned) and when compromised by burn-injury (n = 24). To address the knowledge gap, traumatic thermal injury and disruption of cutaneous surface is associated with genus-level changes in the , reduced bacterial richness, and altered representation of bacterial genes and associated predicted functions across different skin microbial communities. These findings demonstrate that, upon burn-injury, there is a shift in diversity of the skin's organismal assemblages, yielding a core microbiome that is distinct at the genome and functional level. Moreover, deviations from the core community correlate with temporal changes post-injury and community transition from the state of cutaneous health to disease (burn-injury).© The Author(s) 2019.

Infections are often linked to the consumption and handling of poultry meat. The aim of the present study was to investigate the caecal  of birds infected with  at different ages. Therefore, a total of 180 birds of the laying hybrid Lohmann Brown-Classic were housed in 12 subgroups of 15 animals each in three performed repetitions. Three birds per subgroup were experimentally infected with  at an age of about 21 days and about 78 days (4.46 ± 0.35 log CFU/bird). Twenty-one days after experimental infection, microbiome studies were performed on 72 caecal samples of dissected birds (three primary infected and three further birds/subgroup). Amplification within the hypervariable region V 4 of the 16S rRNA gene was performed and sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq platform. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide (version 7.1) and R (version 3.5.2). Both factors, the experimental replication ( < 0.001) and the chickens' age at infection ( < 0.001) contributed significantly to the differences in microbial composition of the caecal samples. The factor experimental replication explained 24% of the sample's variability, whereas the factor age at infection explained 14% thereof. Twelve of 32 families showed a significantly different count profile between the two age groups, whereby strongest differences were seen for seven families, among them the family  (adjusted  = 0.003). The strongest difference between age groups was seen for a bacterial species that is assigned to the genus  which in turn belongs to the family  (adjusted  < 0.0001). Correlation analyses revealed a common relationship in both chicken ages at infection between the absolute abundance of  and , which consists of the genus  In general, concentrations of particular volatile fatty acids (VFA) demonstrated a negative correlation to absolute abundance of , whereby the strongest link was seen for n-butyrate (-0.51141;  < 0.0001).

Obesity in children is also on rise, indicating the urgent need of strategies for prevention and intervention that must begin in early life. While originally posited that obesity results from the simple concept of consuming more calories, or genetics, emerging research suggests that the bacteria living in our gut (gut microbiome) and its interactions with immune cells and metabolic organs including adipose tissues (microbiome-immune-metabolic axis) play significant role in obesity development in childhood. Specifically, abnormal changes (dysbiosis) in the gut microbiome, stimulation of inflammatory cytokines, and shifts in the metabolic functions of brown adipose tissue and the browning of white adipose tissue are associated with increased obesity. Many factors from as early as gestation appear to contribute in obesity, such as maternal health, diet, antibiotic use by mother and/or child, and birth and feeding methods. Herein, using evidence from animal and human studies, we discuss how these factors impact microbiome-immune-metabolic axis and cause obesity epidemic in children, and describe the gaps in knowledge that are warranted for future research.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670167>Reduction in pathogenic load of wheat by tempering with saline organic acid solutions at different seasonal temperatures.</a></h1><p>As a raw agricultural commodity, wheat is exposed to microbial contamination; therefore, enteric pathogens may be among its  creating a food safety risk in milled products. This research evaluates (1) the effectiveness of organic acids dissolved in saline solutions to reduce the counts of pathogenic microorganisms in soft and hard wheat, and also investigates the effect of seasonal temperature on (2) survivability of pathogens in wheat kernels and on (3) pathogen inactivation during tempering with saline organic acid solutions. Wheat samples were inoculated with cocktails of either 5 serovars of Salmonella enterica, 5 E. coli O157:H7 or 6 non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains to achieve a concentration of ~7 log CFU/g. Inoculated samples were allowed to stand for 7-days at temperatures (2.0, 10.8, 24.2, 32 °C) corresponding to those experienced during winter, spring/fall, and summer (average and maximum) in the main wheat growing regions in the state of Nebraska, USA. Besides water, solutions containing acid (acetic or lactic 2.5% or 5.0% v/v) and NaCl (~26% w/v) were used for tempering the wheat to 15.0% (soft) and 15.5% (hard) moisture at the different seasonal temperatures. The survival of pathogenic microorganisms throughout the resting period, and before and after tempering was analyzed by plating samples on injury-recovery media. The survival rate of pathogenic microorganisms on wheat kernels was higher at temperatures experienced during the winter (2.0 °C) and spring/fall (10.8 °C) months. Regardless of tempering temperature, the initial pathogen load was reduced significantly by all solutions when compared to the control tempered with water (P ≤ .05). The combination of lactic acid (5.0%) and NaCl was the most effective treatment against Salmonella enterica, E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 STEC, with average reduction values of 1.8, 1.8 and 1.6 log CFU/g for soft wheat and 2.6, 2.4 and 2.4 log CFU/g for hard wheat, respectively. Implementation of organic acids and NaCl in tempering water may have the potential to reduce the risk of pathogen contamination in milled products.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Antibiotics perturb the bacterial gut composition but the extent of these changes and potential consequences for animal and human health is still debated. Six calves were housed in a controlled environment. Three animals received an injection of the antibiotic florfenicol (Nuflor), and three received no treatment. Faecal samples were collected at 0, 3 and 7 days, and bacterial communities were profiled to assess the impact of a therapy on the gut . Phylogenetic analysis (16S-rDNA) established that at day 7, antibiotic-treated  showed a 10-fold increase in facultative anaerobic Escherichia spp, a signature of imbalanced , dysbiosis. The antibiotic resistome showed a high background of antibiotic resistance genes, which did not significantly change in response to florfenicol. However, the maintenance of Escherichia coli plasmid-encoded quinolone, oqxB and propagation of mcr-2, and colistin resistance genes were observed and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The  of treated animals was enriched with energy harvesting bacteria, common to obese microbial communities. We propose that antibiotic treatment of healthy animals leads to unbalanced, disease- and obese-related  that promotes growth of E. coli carrying resistance genes on mobile elements, potentially increasing the risk of transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria to humans.© 2019 The Authors.

Agricultural domestication of soils, that is, the conversion of previously uncultivated soils to a cultivated state, is frequently accompanied by intensive monoculture, especially in the developing world. However, there is limited understanding of how continuous cultivation alters the structure of prokaryotic soil  after soil domestication, including to what extent crop plants impact soil  composition, and how changes in  composition arising from cultivation affect crop performance.We show here that continuous monoculture (> 8 growing seasons) of the major food crop rice under flooded conditions is associated with a pronounced shift in soil bacterial and archaeal  structure towards a more consistent composition, thereby domesticating  of previously uncultivated sites. Aside from the potential effects of agricultural cultivation practices, we provide evidence that rice plants themselves are important drivers of the domestication process, acting through selective enrichment of specific taxa, including methanogenic archaea, in their rhizosphere that differ from those of native plants growing in the same environment. Furthermore, we find that  from soils domesticated by rice cultivation contribute to plant-soil feedback, by imparting a negative effect on rice seedling vigor.Soil domestication through continuous monoculture cultivation of rice results in compositional changes in the soil , which are in part driven by the rice plants.

We investigated if this applies to eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Stool bacterial DNA was extracted and followed by 16S rRNA amplification from 12 patients with eosinophilic esophagitis and 12 controls. Alpha- and beta-diversity were analyzed. Only two patients had asthma or atopy and one patient was on budesonide. No patients were on PPIs. Patients with EoE had lower gut  alpha diversity (species richness, P = 0.09; Shannon index, P = 0.01). The microbial composition was distinct as evidenced by significantly different beta diversity (P = 0.03) when compared to healthy controls. There were also significant differences in relative abundance at multiple taxonomic levels when comparing the two communities; at the phylum level, we observed a marked decrease in Firmicutes and increase in Bacteroidetes and at the order and family level there were significant decreases in Clostridia and Clostridiales in patients with EoE (q ≤ 0.1). We conclude that there are significant differences in microbial community structure, microbial richness, and evenness and a significant decrease in taxa within the Clostridia in patients with EoE.

PHT is an important driver of hepatic decompensation such as development of ascites or variceal bleeding. Dysbiosis and an impaired intestinal barrier in ACLD facilitate translocation of bacteria and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that promote disease progression  immune system activation with subsequent induction of proinflammatory and profibrogenic pathways. Congestive portal venous blood flow represents a critical pathophysiological mechanism linking PHT to increased intestinal permeability: The intestinal barrier function is affected by impaired microcirculation, neoangiogenesis, and abnormal vascular and mucosal permeability. The close bidirectional relationship between the gut and the liver has been termed "gut-liver axis". Treatment strategies targeting the gut-liver axis by modulation of  composition and function, intestinal barrier integrity, as well as amelioration of liver fibrosis and PHT are supposed to exert beneficial effects. The activation of the farnesoid X receptor in the liver and the gut was associated with beneficial effects in animal experiments, however, further studies regarding efficacy and safety of pharmacological FXR modulation in patients with ACLD are needed. In this review, we summarize the clinical impact of PHT on the course of liver disease, discuss the underlying pathophysiological link of PHT to gut-liver axis signaling, and provide insight into molecular mechanisms that may represent novel therapeutic targets.©The Author(s) 2019.

We employed RNA sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile gene expression in blood and the composition of the fecal  in infants born at <29 weeks gestational age and diagnosed with BPD in comparison to those of preterm infants that were not diagnosed with BPD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, performed longitudinally on 255 fecal samples collected from 50 infants in the first months of life, identified significant differences in the relative levels of abundance of , and  in the BPD infants in a manner that was birth mode dependent. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that more than 400 genes were upregulated in infants with BPD. Genes upregulated in BPD infants were significantly enriched for functions related to red blood cell development and oxygen transport, while several immune-related pathways were downregulated. We also identified a gene expression signature consistent with an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD71 early erythroid cells in infants with BPD. Intriguingly, genes that were correlated in their expression with the relative abundances of specific taxa in the  were significantly enriched for roles in the immune system, suggesting that changes in the  might influence immune gene expression systemically. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious inflammatory condition of the lung and is the most common complication associated with preterm birth. A large body of evidence now suggests that the gut  can influence immunity and inflammation systemically; however, the role of the gut  in BPD has not been evaluated to date. Here, we report that there are significant differences in the gut  of infants born at <29 weeks gestation and subsequently diagnosed with BPD, which are particularly pronounced when infants are stratified by birth mode. We also show that erythroid and immune gene expression levels are significantly altered in BPD infants. Interestingly, we identified an association between the composition of the  and immune gene expression in blood in early life.

However, it is unclear whether the gut  will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.5:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = 2:1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut  of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading  such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut  were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism were dominant metabolic pathways. Lipid metabolism was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal fat deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading  (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the lipid metabolic pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal fat accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649646>Microbial Metabolic Capacity for Intestinal Folate Production and Modulation of Host Folate Receptors.</a></h1><p>Microbial metabolites, including B complex vitamins contribute to diverse aspects of human health. Folate, or vitamin B, refers to a broad category of biomolecules that include pterin, para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), and glutamate subunits. Folates are required for DNA synthesis and epigenetic regulation. In addition to dietary nutrients, the gut  has been recognized as a source of B complex vitamins, including folate. This study evaluated the predicted folate synthesis capabilities in the genomes of human commensal microbes identified in the Human Microbiome Project and folate production by representative strains of six human intestinal bacterial phyla. Bacterial folate synthesis genes were ubiquitous across 512 gastrointestinal reference genomes with 13% of the genomes containing all genes required for complete  folate synthesis. An additional 39% of the genomes had the genetic capacity to synthesize folates in the presence of pABA, an upstream intermediate that can be obtained through diet or from other intestinal microbes. Bacterial folate synthesis was assessed during exponential and stationary phase growth through the evaluation of expression of select folate synthesis genes, quantification of total folate production, and analysis of folate polyglutamylation. Increased expression of key folate synthesis genes was apparent in exponential phase, and increased folate polyglutamylation occurred during late stationary phase. Of the folate producers, we focused on the commensal  to examine host-microbe interactions in relation to folate and examined folate receptors in the physiologically relevant human enteroid model. RNAseq data revealed segment-specific folate receptor distribution. Treatment of human colonoid monolayers with conditioned media (CM) from wild-type  did not influence the expression of key folate transporters proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) or reduced folate carrier (RFC).

Data are mounting that the bacterial communities that reside within the vagina, collectively termed the vaginal , aid in defense against sexually transmitted infections. Disruptions in the vaginal , such as during episodes of bacterial vaginosis, may increase susceptibility to infection. Herein, we describe the clinical core protocol for a NIH NIAID Cooperative Research Center titled Eco-Pathogenomic of Chlamydial Reproductive Tract Infection. The primary goals of the project are to describe the interrelationships between the urogenital microenvironment, the properties of the pathogen and immunologic responses of the host in men and women, and their association with clinical outcomes of CT infection in women.Men and women with confirmed genital CT infections were recruited to a number of study protocols, including cross-sectional and longitudinal sub-studies. Participants completed a demographic and sexual health questionnaire and underwent a physical exam at baseline. In the longitudinal study arms, biologic samples were collected daily, weekly, and monthly to determine the relationships between the vaginal , prevalent CT infection, re-infection and treatment.The biological samples and the demographic and history information collected throughout this study will be used for various analyses evaluating genomics, metabolomics and host immune responses in the context of CT infection.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668878>Polyphasic characterization of two novel Lactobacillus spp. isolated from blown salami packages: Description of Lactobacillus halodurans sp. nov. and Lactobacillus salsicarnum sp. nov.</a></h1><p> analysis of blown pack spoiled salami revealed five distinguishable Lactobacillus isolates we could not assign to a known species. Two of the isolates (TMW 1.2172 and TMW 1.1920) are rod-shaped, whilst three isolates (TMW 1.2098, TMW 1.2118 and TMW 1.2188) appear coccus shaped or as short rods. All isolates are Gram-stain positive, facultative anaerobic, catalase and oxidase negative, non-motile and non-sporulating. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA, dnaK, pheS and rpoA gene sequences revealed two distinct lineages within the genus Lactobacillus (L.). The isolates are members of the Lactobacillus alimentarius group with Lactobacillus ginsenosidimutans DSM 24154 (99.4% 16S similarity), Lactobacillus versmoldensis DSM 14857 (97.9%) and Lactobacillus furfuricola DSM 27174 (97.7%) as phylogenetic closest related species and L. alimentarius DSM 20249 (97.7%) and Lactobacillus paralimentarius DSM 13961 (97.5%) as closest relatives, respectively. Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values between the isolates and their close related type strains are lower than 80% and 25%, respectively. For both designated type strains, the peptidoglycan type is A4α l-Lys-d-Asp and the major fatty acids are C, C and summed feature 7. Based on phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic analysis we demonstrated that the investigated isolates belong to two novel Lactobacillus species for which we propose the names Lactobacillus salsicarnum with the type strain TMW 1.2098=DSM 109451=LMG 31401and Lactobacillus halodurans with the type strain TMW 1.2172=DSM 109452=LMG 31402.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

An area of fascination and great potential is the human microbiome. Recent studies suggest that the gut  has significant roles in an individual's ability to avoid cancer, with considerable focus on the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer. That in mind, racial disparities with regard to colorectal cancer treatment and prevention are generally understudied despite higher incidence and mortality rates among Non-Hispanic Blacks compared to other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. A comprehension of ethnic differences with relation to colorectal cancer, dietary habits and the microbiome is a meritorious area of investigation. This review highlights literature that identifies and bridges the gap in understanding the role of the human microbiome in racial disparities across colorectal cancer. Herein, we explore the differences in the gut , common short chain fatty acids produced in abundance by microbes, and their association with racial differences in cancer acquisition.©The Author(s) 2019.

The GM is well-known to be involved in the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism of OMVs is not clear. In the present study, we demonstrated the involvement of OMVs in the development of cognitive (learning and memory) dysfunction induced by blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. More important, further study showed that OMVs induced tau phosphorylation by activating glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) in the hippocampus. OMVs activated astrocytes and microglia, increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines (nuclear factor κB, interleukin-1β, and tumour necrosis factor-α) in the hippocampus. Therefore, OMVs increase the permeability of the BBB and promote the activation of astrocytes and microglia, inducing an inflammatory response and tau hyperphosphorylation by activating the GSK-3β pathway and finally leading to cognitive impairment.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669435>Untargeted Metabolomic Profiling Identifies Disease-specific Signatures in Food Allergy and Asthma.</a></h1><p>Food allergy (FA) affects an increasing proportion of children. for reasons that remain obscure. Novel disease biomarkers and curative treatment options are strongly needed.To apply untargeted metabolomic profiling to identify pathogenic mechanisms and candidate disease biomarkers in FA.Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed on serum samples of children with either FA alone, asthma alone or both FA and asthma as well as healthy pediatric controls.In this pilot study FA subjects exhibited a disease-specific metabolomic signature as compared to both control subjects and asthmatics. In particular, FA was uniquely associated with a marked decrease in sphingolipids, as well as a number of other lipid metabolites, in the face of normal frequencies of circulating natural killer T (NKT) cells. Specific comparison of FA and asthmatic subjects revealed differences in the -sensitive aromatic amino acid and secondary bile acid metabolism. Children with both FA and asthma exhibited a metabolomic profile that aligned with that of FA alone but not asthma. Among children with FA, history of severe systemic reactions and presence of multiple FA were associated with changes in tryptophan metabolites, eicosanoids, plasmalogens, and fatty acids.Children with FA display a disease-specific metabolomic profile that is informative of disease mechanisms and severity, and which dominates in the presence of asthma. Lower levels of sphingolipids and ceramides and other metabolomic alterations observed in FA children may reflect the interplay between an altered  and immune cell subsets in the gut.Copyright © 2019.

It is usually diagnosed clinically by direct detection of an abnormal pattern of the intestinal . The intermediate diagnosis based on determining the content of microflora metabolites, considered as chemical markers of this disorder, is still rarely used. This is, among others, due to the variety of properties of compounds recognised as dysbiosis markers and as a consequence, the use of different methods for their analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no analytical procedure that would allow unambiguous determination of all compounds in one procedure. In the present study, we have established a detailed method for the quantitative analysis of hydrocinnamic, citramalic, p-hydroxybenzeneacetic, tartaric, hippuric, 4-hydroxybenzoic, indoxylsulfuric, tricarballylic, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic and benzoic acids along with DL-arabitol that employs the direct derivatization of compounds in a small volume of urine sample followed by gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). To show that the optimised method is a useful tool for chemical diagnosis of dysbiosis, it was applied for determination of the dysbiosis markers in the authentic urine samples.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The Mediterranean dietary pattern is considered one of the healthiest of all dietary patterns. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet protects against diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Reported consumption of a Mediterranean diet pattern was associated with lower breast cancer risk for women with all subtypes of breast cancer, and a Western diet pattern was associated with greater risk. In this review, we contrast the available epidemiological breast cancer data, comparing the impact of consuming a Mediterranean diet to the Western diet. Furthermore, we will review the preclinical data highlighting the anticancer molecular mechanism of Mediterranean diet consumption in both cancer prevention and therapeutic outcomes. Diet composition is a major constituent shaping the gut microbiome. Distinct patterns of gut  composition are associated with the habitual consumption of animal fats, high-fiber diets, and vegetable-based diets. We will review the impact of Mediterranean diet on the gut microbiome and inflammation. Outside of the gut, we recently demonstrated that Mediterranean diet consumption led to distinct  shifts in the mammary gland tissue, suggesting possible anticancer effects by diet on breast-specific microbiome.

Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut  composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut  variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut  by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut , which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656993>The gut  to the brain axis in the metabolic control.</a></h1><p>The regulation of glycemia is under a tight neuronal detection of glucose levels performed by the gut-brain axis and an efficient efferent neuronal message sent to the peripheral organs, as the pancreas to induce insulin and inhibit glucagon secretions.

The rat model of sepsis was reproduced by injection of 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via tail vein, the rats in the NS control group was given the same amount of NS. The rats in the fecal  transplantation group received nasogastric infusion of feces from healthy donor on the 1st day, 2 mL each time, for 3 times a day, the other two groups were given equal dose of NS by gavage. Fecal samples were collected on the 7th day after modeling, the levels of intestinal  composition was determined using the 16SrDNA gene sequencing technology. The brain function was evaluated by electroencephalogram (EEG), and the proportion of each waveform in EEG was calculated. After sacrifice of rats, the brain tissues were harvested, the levels of protein expression of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) were determined by Western Blot, and positive cells of Iba-1 in brain tissue were detected by immunohistochemistry method.

However, due to the diverse processing conditions applied across Europe, it remained unclear to which degree bacterial heterogeneity can be encountered in commercially available fermented meat products and whether this is linked to their geographical origin. Therefore, the bacterial species diversity of 80 fermented meat products available in the Belgian retail, coming from five different countries, was investigated. It was also assessed how this related to the country of origin and the key processing parameters pH and salt concentration. The samples originated from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. In general, Southern European fermented meat products commonly had a higher pH, with their lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities being represented by  and with mostly  and  governing over the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) communities. Among these products, the Spanish variants showed a higher prevalence of , whereas  was the prevailing CNS species in most French and Italian fermented meat products. In contrast, Northern European fermented meat products were generally more acidified and showed a higher prevalence of  in their LAB communities, whereas  represented the CNS communities. Non-parametric statistical tests indicated the impact of the geographical origin on the prevalence of the LAB and CNS species.

Abnormalities in this -gut-brain axis have emerged as a key component in the pathophysiology of depression, leading to more research attempting to understand the neuroactive potential of the products of gut microbial metabolism. This review explores the potential for the gut  to contribute to depression and focuses on the role that microbially-derived molecules - neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids, indoles, bile acids, choline metabolites, lactate and vitamins - play in the context of emotional behavior. The future of gut-brain axis research lies is moving away from association, towards the mechanisms underlying the relationship between the gut bacteria and depressive behavior. We propose that direct and indirect mechanisms exist through which gut microbial metabolites affect depressive behavior: these include (i) direct stimulation of central receptors, (ii) peripheral stimulation of neural, endocrine, and immune mediators, and (iii) epigenetic regulation of histone acetylation and DNA methylation. Elucidating these mechanisms is essential to expand our understanding of the etiology of depression, and to develop new strategies to harness the beneficial psychotropic effects of these molecules.

Nutritional status has a clear relationship with disease outcomes, and malnutrition in CF is typically a result of chronic negative energy balance secondary to malabsorption. As the mechanisms underlying the pathology of CF and its implications on nutrient absorption and energy expenditure have been elucidated, nutrition support has become increasingly sophisticated. Comprehensive nutrition monitoring and treatment guidelines from professional and advocacy organizations have unified the approach to nutrition optimization around the world. Newborn screening allows for early nutrition intervention and improvement in short- and long-term growth and other clinical outcomes. The nutrition support goal in CF care includes achieving optimal nutritional status to support growth and pubertal development in children, maintenance of optimal nutritional status in adult life, and optimizing fat soluble vitamin and essential fatty acid status. The mainstay of this approach is a high calorie, high-fat diet, exceeding age, and sex energy intake recommendations for healthy individuals. For patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, enzyme replacement therapy is required to improve fat and calorie absorption. Enzyme dosing varies by age and dietary fat intake. Multiple potential impediments to absorption, including decreased motility, altered gut luminal bile salt and  composition, and enteric inflammation must be considered. Fat soluble vitamin supplementation is required in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. In this report, nutrition support across the age and disease spectrum is discussed, with a focus on the relationships among nutritional status, growth, and disease outcomes.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655861> Associated with Dromedary Camel Milk from Algerian Sahara.</a></h1><p>Despite the fact that camel milk represents a valuable food source, the fungal diversity of raw camel milk has been poorly studied so far.

The application of both culture-dependent and independent molecular techniques, based on dHPLC analysis and metabarcoding of ITS region, provided a complementary biodiversity assessment of camel milk fungi which was composed of 15 different taxa. Yeast species belonged to Filobasidium, Naganishia, Malassezia, Mrakia, Rhodotorula, and Yarrowia genera; and mold species belonged to Fusarium, Cladosporium, and Penicillium genera. All three techniques revealed that the fungal community was dominated by species belonging to the former genus Cryptococcus (Filobasidium and Naganishia) although none of them was able to encompass the entire fungal diversity alone.

Enterococcal infections, mainly caused by Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, include apical periodontitis, endocarditis, and bloodstream infections. Recently, vancomycinresistant Enterococci are considered major pathogens that are common but difficult to treat, especially in nosocomial settings. Moreover, E. faecalis is closely associated with recurrent endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment. In this study, we investigated the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which are metabolites fermented by gut , on the growth of Enterococci. Enterococci were cultured in the presence or absence of acetate, propionate, or butyrate, and the optical density at 600 nm was measured to determine bacterial growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration test was conducted. Bacteria were treated with a SCFA, together with clinically used endodontic treatment methods such as triple antibiotics (metronidazole, minocycline, and ciprofloxacin) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) to determine the effects of combination treatment. Of the SCFAs, propionate had a bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of E. faecalis in a dose-dependent manner and also that of clinical strains of E. faecalis isolated from dental plaques. Meanwhile, acetate and butyrate had minimal effects on E. faecalis growth. Moreover, propionate inhibited the growth of other Enterococci including E. faecium. In addition, combination treatment of propionate and triple antibiotics led to further growth inhibition, whereas no cooperative effect was observed at propionate plus CHX. These results indicate that propionate attenuates the growth of Enterococci, suggesting propionate as a potential agent to control Enterococcal infections, especially when combined with triple antibiotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666311>Incidence of necrotising enterocolitis before and after introducing routine prophylactic  and  probiotics.</a></h1><p>To compare rates of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), late-onset sepsis, and mortality in 5-year epochs before and after implementation of routine daily multistrain probiotics administration in high-risk neonates.Single-centre retrospective observational study over the 10-year period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017.Level 3 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, UK.Preterm neonates at high risk of NEC: admitted to NICU within 3 days of birth at <32 weeks' gestation or at 32-36 weeks' gestation and of birth weight <1500 g.Prior to 1 January 2013 probiotics were not used. Thereafter, dual-species  and  combination probiotics were routinely administered daily to high-risk neonates; from April 2016 triple-species probiotics (    and   subspecies ) were used.Incidence of NEC (modified Bell's stage 2a or greater), late-onset sepsis, and mortality.Rates of NEC fell from 7.5% (35/469 neonates) in the pre-implementation epoch to 3.1% (16/513 neonates) in the routine probiotics epoch (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85, p=0.014). The more than halving of NEC rates after probiotics introduction was independent of any measured covariates, including breast milk feeding rates. Cases of late-onset sepsis fell from 106/469 (22.6%) to 59/513 (11.5%) (p<0.0001), and there was no episode of sepsis due to  or . All-cause mortality also fell in the routine probiotics epoch, from 67/469 (14.3%) to 47/513 (9.2%), although this was not statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.74, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.12, p=0.155).Administration of multispecies  and  probiotics has been associated with a significantly decreased risk of NEC and late-onset sepsis in our neonatal unit, and no safety issues.

Therefore, the alteration of the intestinal  in order to achieve, restore, and maintain favorable balance in the ecosystem, and the activity of microorganisms present in the gastrointestinal tract is necessary for the improved health condition of the host. The objective of this translational study was to evaluate, in a pediatric population, the efficacy and safety of prophylactic probiotics for a better nutritional absorption capacity in the view to enhance their overall health and immunity.A total of 40 pediatric patients between the ages of 14 and 18 years were enrolled in the study and divided under two categories (treated/active group and placebo group). Three-time points clinical evaluations were performed: a baseline assessment (Time 0), a second evaluation at 5 weeks after the start of probiotic use (Time 1), and a final evaluation at the timeline after 10 weeks (Time 2). In the initial phase of the study, the recruited subjects underwent a panel of initial T0 clinical tests. For each of the patients, a blood sample was taken in order to evaluate the following biochemical measurements: Vitamin D, Vitamin A, Calcium, Zinc, and Iron. Moreover, an initial nutritional evaluation was carried out through which the nutritionist estimated the body composition of the subject (weight and body mass index), the caloric needs and dietary behaviour of each recruited patient.Eligible participants were randomized into placebo (n = 20) or treated/active (n = 20) treatment conditions by random allocation using a computerized random number generator, ensuring all investigators remained blind to the treatment distribution. The data were compared within and between groups using statistical methods. The results confirmed that the probiotic supplementation was effective in increasing the overall blood biomarkers levels of vitamins, calcium, and mineral absorption from baseline to 10 weeks of treatment, compared with the placebo.Probiotics may be suggested as supplements to improve biomarkers serum concentration if administered for a period of at least ≥ 5 weeks.

The gut of children with optimum growth is enriched in certain species, especially  and  and ommensal  both contribute to formation of acidic stool, and an elevated faecal pH indicates reduction of these species in the gut. The purpose of the study was to investigate the association of faecal pH with childhood stunting.In this cross-sectional study, 100 children with length-for-age Z score (LAZ) <-1 aged between 12 and 18 months were enrolled from the ongoing Bangladesh Environmental Enteric Dysfunction study conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh. LAZ was measured by anthropometry and data on factors affecting linear growth were recorded. Faecal pH measurement was done using pH metre on freshly collected non-diarrhoeal faecal samples following standard procedure. Multiple quantile regression was done to quantify the relation between faecal pH and LAZ scores.The mean LAZ and faecal pH of the children were -2.12±0.80 and 5.84±1.11, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis showed a statistically significant negative correlation between stool pH and the LAZ scores (p<0.01). After inclusion of other factors affecting linear growth into the regression model, a statistically significant inverse association was observed between faecal pH and LAZ score (p<0.01).Elevated faecal pH was found to have a significant association with stunted growth.

Given the importance of the spinal cord as a locomotor control center and the public perception that paralysis is the defining feature of SCI, this "spinal-centric" focus is logical. Unfortunately, such a focus likely will not yield new discoveries that reverse other devastating consequences of SCI including cardiovascular and metabolic disease, bladder/bowel dysfunction and infection. The current review considers how SCI changes the physiological interplay between the spinal cord, the gut and the immune system. A suspected culprit in causing many of the pathological manifestations of impaired spinal cord-gut-immune axis homeostasis is the gut . After SCI, the composition of the gut  changes, creating a chronic state of gut "dysbiosis". To date, much of what we know about gut dysbiosis was learned from 16S-based taxonomic profiling studies that reveal changes in the composition and abundance of various bacteria. However, this approach has limitations and creates taxonomic "blindspots". Notably, only bacteria can be analyzed. Thus, in this review we also discuss how the application of emerging sequencing technologies can improve our understanding of how the broader ecosystem in the gut is affected by SCI. Specifically, metagenomics will provide researchers with a more comprehensive look at post-injury changes in the gut virome (and mycome). Metagenomics also allows changes in microbe population dynamics to be linked to specific microbial functions that can affect the development and progression of metabolic disease, immune dysfunction and affective disorders after SCI. As these new tools become more readily available and used across the research community, the development of an "ecogenomic" toolbox will facilitate an Eco-Systems Biology approach to study the complex interplay along the spinal cord-gut-immune axis after SCI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

M cells actively transport luminal antigens to the underlying lymphoid follicles to initiate an immune response. The molecular machinery of M-cell differentiation and function has been vigorously investigated over the last decade. Studies have shed light on the role of M cells in the mucosal immune system and have revealed that antigen uptake by M cells contributes to not only mucosal but also systemic immune responses. However, M-cell studies usually focus on infectious diseases; the contribution of M cells to autoimmune diseases has remained largely unexplored. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the intestinal  is implicated in multiple systemic diseases, including autoimmune diseases. This implies that the uptake of microorganisms by M cells in PPs may play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. We provide an outline of the current understanding of M-cell biology and subsequently discuss the potential contribution of M cells and PPs to the induction of systemic autoimmunity, beyond the mucosal immune response.Copyright © 2019 Kobayashi, Takahashi, Takano, Kimura and Hase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645720>The  regulate neuronal function and fear extinction learning.</a></h1><p>Multicellular organisms have co-evolved with complex consortia of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites, collectively referred to as the .

Here we show that manipulation of the  in antibiotic-treated or germ-free adult mice results in significant deficits in fear extinction learning. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain revealed significant alterations in gene expression in excitatory neurons, glia and other cell types. Transcranial two-photon imaging showed that deficits in extinction learning after manipulation of the  in adult mice were associated with defective learning-related remodelling of postsynaptic dendritic spines and reduced activity in cue-encoding neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. In addition, selective re-establishment of the  revealed a limited neonatal developmental window in which -derived signals can restore normal extinction learning in adulthood. Finally, unbiased metabolomic analysis identified four metabolites that were significantly downregulated in germ-free mice and have been reported to be related to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans and mouse models, suggesting that -derived compounds may directly affect brain function and behaviour. Together, these data indicate that fear extinction learning requires -derived signals both during early postnatal neurodevelopment and in adult mice, with implications for our understanding of how diet, infection, and lifestyle influence brain health and subsequent susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651219>Human Nasal Microbiome as Characterized by Metagenomics Differs Markedly Between Rural and Industrial Communities in Egypt.</a></h1><p>Microbial communities residing in the nose play important roles in human health and disease. We report marked differences in nasal  between a rural community and an industrial setting located near a major urban city. Nasal samples were collected from 19 healthy male subjects: 9 samples from persons living in a rural village, and 10 samples from ceramic factory workers in a major industrial Egyptian city. The nasal  in the rural sample had higher and distinct diversity compared with industrial samples from workers exposed to pollution daily. Taxonomic analysis of the sequences revealed five major phyla; among these phyla were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria, revealing significant abundance variation by geographical location. For example, the rural group had a significant increase in representation of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes ( = 0.004,  = 0.01, respectively) compared with the industrial group. However, the industrial group showed a significant increase in relative abundance of phylum Proteobacteria ( = 0.02).

An obstacle to understanding this contradiction has been a shortage of in vivo models reproducing the unique structure and immunology of human skin. In this work, we developed a humanized model to study how healthy adult human skin responds to colonizing methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). We demonstrate the importance of the outer stratum corneum as the major site of bacterial colonization and how noninvasive MRSA adhesion to corneocytes induces a local inflammatory response in underlying skin layers. This signaling recruits neutrophils to the skin, where they control bacterial numbers, mediating transiency in colonization. This work highlights the spatiotemporal aspects of human skin colonization and demonstrates a subclinical inflammatory response to noninvasive MRSA that allows human skin to regulate the bacterial population at its outer surface.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with energy metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner.

This finding could result from the translocation of still alive bacteria from gut to joints through blood, since the diversified dormant  of healthy human blood can be transiently resuscitated in vitro. The recent finding of gut microbiome in human cartilage, which differed between osteoarthritis and controls, suggests that a similar trafficking of dead or alive bacteria from gut  physiologically occurs between gut and epiphysial bone marrow. Subchondral  could enhance cartilage healing and transform components of deep cartilage matrix in metabolites with immunosuppressive properties. The differences of microbiome observed between hip and knee cartilage, either in osteoarthritis or controls, might be the counterpart of subtle differences in chondrocyte metabolism, themselves in line with differences in DNA methylation according to joints. Although bacteria theoretically cannot reach chondrocytes from the surface of intact cartilage, some bacteria enter the vascular channels of the epiphysial growth cartilage in young animals, whereas others can infect chondrocytes in vitro. In osteoarthritis, the early osteochondral plate angiogenesis may further enhance the ability of  to locate close to the deeper layers of cartilage, and this might lead to focal dysbiosis, low-grade inflammation, cartilage degradation, epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and worsening of osteoarthritis. More studies on cartilage across different ethnic groups, weights, and according to age, are needed, to confirm the silent presence of gut  close to human cartilage and better understand its physiologic and pathogenic significance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut , while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut , and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with 5 mg iron (2.5 mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 2.5 mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7.5 g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.5-9.5 months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; (2) effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut  in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut , gut inflammation, iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut .

It is well accepted that the mere measurement of antibiotics does not reflect the actual bioavailability. In fact, antibiotics can be adsorbed or complexed to particles and/or chemicals in water and soil. Bioavailable concentrations of antibiotics in soil and water are subjected to great uncertainty, therefore biological assays are increasingly recognized as that allow an indirect determination of the residual antibiotic activity. Here we propose how a fitness test for bacteria can be used to qualitatively assess the bioavailability of a specific antibiotic in the environment. The findings show that by using a pair of resistant and sensitive bacterial strains, the resulting fitness can indirectly reflect antibiotic bioavailability. Hence, this test can be used as a complementary assay to other biological and chemical tests to assess bioavailability of antibiotics.Copyright © 2018.

In mammals, host phylogeny is one of the main drivers of gut , a result of vertical transfer of  during birth. In birds, it is less clear what the drivers might be, but both phylogeny and environmental factors may play a role. We investigated host and environmental factors that underlie variation in gut  composition in eight species of migratory shorebirds. We characterized bacterial communities from 375 fecal samples collected from adults of eight shorebird species captured at a network of nine breeding sites in the Arctic and sub-Arctic ecoregions of North America, by sequencing the V4 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Firmicutes (55.4%), Proteobacteria (13.8%), Fusobacteria (10.2%), and Bacteroidetes (8.1%) dominated the gut  of adult shorebirds. Breeding location was the main driver of variation in gut  of breeding shorebirds (  = 11.6%), followed by shorebird host species (  = 1.8%), and sampling year (  = 0.9%), but most variation remained unexplained. Site variation resulted from differences in the core bacterial taxa, whereas rare, low-abundance bacteria drove host species variation.

However, it is unknown whether sialylated lactuloses have modulatory effects on the intestinal . In this study, 60 healthy mice were randomly divided into six groups, namely, a normal control group, a lactulose group, a Kdn-α2,3-lactulose group, a Kdn-α2,6-lactulose group, a Neu5Ac-α2,3-lactulose group, and a Neu5Ac-α2,6-lactulose group. After 14 days of lactulose administration, the feces of three mice from each group were collected, and the intestinal  were detected by Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was increased in the sialylated lactulose groups, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased. At the family level, sialylated lactulose intervention decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroidales S24-7 group and Helicobacteraceae and enhanced the abundance of Lactobacillaceae, which reflects the modulatory effect of sialylated lactulose on intestinal . Diversity analysis indicated that the index of Chao was higher in the sialylated lactulose groups than in the normal control group, and the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were higher in the Kdnα-2,6-lactulose group and the Neu5Ac-α2,3-lactulose group than in the normal control group. The results of the intestinal  sample composition indicated that there were differences between the sialylated lactulose groups and the normal control group.

However, the inoculation of  showed significant negative effects on the shoot, root, and total biomass of licorice plants. In addition, the effects of DSE inoculation on the morphological, photosynthetic, and antioxidant parameters of licorice plants, and mineral nutrient and microbial community composition in the rhizosphere soil were dependent on the DSE species as well as water regime. Interestingly, DSE inoculation significantly increased AM fungi content under drought stress. In addition, DSE associated with water had a significant positive influence on soil organic matter, available phosphorus (P), AM fungi, leaf number, soluble protein, SOD activity, total root length, root branch, and glycyrrhizic acid content. Based on the results of variance partitioning analysis, 17.0, 34.0, 14.9, 40.1, 28.2, and 18.0% variations in shoot morphology, root morphology, plant biomass, active ingredient, photosynthetic parameters, and antioxidant parameters, respectively, were attributable to the presence of certain soil microorganisms. These findings suggest the possibility that DSE inoculation improved the root development and nutrient absorption of host plants, altered the soil , and might also contribute to plant growth and survival under drought conditions. As  exhibited positive effects on the plant biomass, morphological and physiological parameters, and active ingredient content in licorice plants under drought stress, it was considered to be the best fungus for licorice cultivation. These results contribute to the understanding of the ecological function of DSE fungi in dryland agriculture.Copyright © 2019 He, Wang and Hou.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649168>Vulnerability of the industrialized .</a></h1><p>The human body is an ecosystem that is home to a complex array of microbes known as the microbiome or .

The diversity of human gut  has been correlated with aging, which was characterized by different abundance of bacteria in various age groups. In the literature, most of the previous studies of age-related gut  changes focused on individual species in the gut community with supervised methods. Here, we aimed to examine the underlying aging progression of the human gut microbial community from an unsupervised perspective.We obtained raw 16S rRNA sequencing data of subjects ranging from newborns to centenarians from a previous study, and summarized the data into a relative abundance matrix of genera in all the samples. Without using the age information of samples, we applied an unsupervised algorithm to recapitulate the underlying aging progression of microbial community from hosts in different age groups and identify genera associated to this progression. Literature review of these identified genera indicated that for individuals with advanced ages, some beneficial genera are lost while some genera related with inflammation and cancer increase.The multivariate unsupervised analysis here revealed the existence of a continuous aging progression of human gut  along with the host aging process. The identified genera associated to this aging process are meaningful for designing probiotics to maintain the gut  to resemble a young age, which hopefully will lead to positive impact on human health, especially for individuals in advanced age groups.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654515>Human microbiome and allergic diseases in children: pathogenetic role and therapeutic options.</a></h1><p>The recent and extensive study of the microbiome has provided an enormous amount of data concerning the type and possible functions of microorganisms present in the gut, airways, genital tract, and skin.

This research is particularly relevant in paediatrics, since allergic diseases are constantly increasing and there is evidence in the paediatric age that shows that the composition of the microbiome in the foetal and neonatal period plays a key role in the development of the immune system: vaginal delivery, breastfeeding, childhood spent in rural environments and/or in contact with animals result in a greater biodiversity of the microbiome with the presence of protective species that reduce the activation of Th2 lymphocytes, involved in allergic reactions. Further studies are necessary to better understand the  role in the pathogenesis of atopy in order to understand if specific probiotics and prebiotics, administered orally or topically, can affect the  composition and modulate immune system functions, producing a therapeutic effect in the treatment of allergic diseases. This narrative review analysed the available literature regarding the correlation between the microbiome and the development of allergic diseases and with special focus on paediatric studies. The skin, gut or lung dysbiosis can be a cofactor in the pathogenesis of allergies and the remodulation of the microbiome becomes an important therapeutic challenge.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654298>The Intestinal  as a Reservoir and a Therapeutic Target to Fight Multi-Drug-Resistant Bacteria: A Narrative Review of the Literature.</a></h1><p>The appearance and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly in specific closed environments such as intensive care units of acute care hospitals, have become a major health concern. The intestinal  has various functions including host protection from overgrowth or colonization by unwanted bacteria. The exposure to antibiotics significantly reduces the bacterial density of intestinal  leaving an ecologic void that can be occupied by potentially pathogenic and/or resistant bacteria frequently present in hospital settings. Consequently, the intestinal  of inpatients acts as a major reservoir and plays a critical role in perpetuating the spread of resistant bacteria. There are novel innovative methods to protect the host  during antibiotic treatment, but they do not offer a solution for already established colonization by resistant microorganisms. Fecal  transfer (FMT) is a promising intervention to achieve this goal; however, controlled trials report lower success rates than initial retrospective studies, especially in case of gram negatives. The aim of the present article is to highlight the importance of the intestinal  in the global spread of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms and to review the recent advances to protect the human  from the action of antibiotics as well as a critical discussion about the evidence of decolonization of MDR microorganisms by FMT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653078>The Role of the Gut  in Colorectal Cancer Causation.</a></h1><p>Here, we reviewed emerging evidence on the role of the microbial community in colorectal carcinogenesis. A healthy gut  promotes intestinal homeostasis and can exert anti-cancer effects; however, this  also produces a variety of metabolites that are genotoxic and which can negatively influence epithelial cell behaviour. Disturbances in the normal microbial balance, known as dysbiosis, are frequently observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Microbial species linked to CRC include certain strains of ,   and   amongst others. Whether these microbes are merely passive dwellers exploiting the tumour environment, or rather, active protagonists in the carcinogenic process is the subject of much research. The incidence of chemically-induced tumours in mice models varies, depending upon the presence or absence of these microorganisms, thus strongly suggesting influences on disease causation. Putative mechanistic explanations differentially link these strains to DNA damage, inflammation, aberrant cell behaviour and immune suppression. In the future, modulating the composition and metabolic activity of this microbial community may have a role in prevention and therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659582>Age-related compositional and functional changes in micro-pig gut microbiome.</a></h1><p>Age-related changes in human gut  composition have been reported, and such changes might be influenced by the intake of nutrients or diets. To investigate the effects of aging on the gut  independent of nutrient effects, we analyzed the gut microbiomes of 126 micro-pigs at a wide range of ages from newborns to 10 years old. The micro-pigs were reared in a constantly controlled environment. The diversity of the gut microbiome was found to continuously change with age. We also found associations between age and specific members and functions of the gut microbiome. Consistent with previous studies on the human gut microbiome, beneficial microbes including probiotic bacteria and short-chain fatty acid-producers decreased in older pigs, whereas Bacteroides increased with age. Based on the correlation network, Bacteroides seemed to have an important role in determining the relative abundances of other beneficial microbes. Our results suggest that maintaining beneficial gut microbes at a specific ratio corresponding to a certain age might contribute to a younger gut microbiome-age. Furthermore, due to similarities with the human system, micro-pigs are a useful animal model to elucidate the links between aging and the microbiome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666028>Diet is not the primary driver of bacterial community structure in the gut of litter-feeding cockroaches.</a></h1><p>Diet is a major determinant of bacterial community structure in termite guts, but evidence of its importance in the closely related cockroaches is conflicting. Here, we investigated the ecological drivers of the bacterial gut  in cockroaches that feed on lignocellulosic leaf litter.The physicochemical conditions determined with microsensors in the guts of Ergaula capucina, Pycnoscelus surinamensis, and Byrsotria rothi were similar to those reported for both wood-feeding and omnivorous cockroaches. All gut compartments were anoxic at the center and showed a slightly acidic to neutral pH and variable but slightly reducing conditions. Hydrogen accumulated only in the crop of B. rothi. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes documented that community structure in individual gut compartments correlated strongly with the respective microenvironmental conditions. A comparison of the hindgut  of cockroaches and termites from different feeding groups revealed that the vast majority of the core taxa in cockroaches with a lignocellulosic diet were present also in omnivorous cockroaches but absent in wood-feeding higher termites.Our results indicate that diet is not the primary driver of bacterial community structure in the gut of wood- and litter-feeding cockroaches. The high similarity to the gut  of omnivorous cockroaches suggests that the dietary components that are actually digested do not differ fundamentally between feeding groups.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671768>Quantification of Urinary Phenyl-γ-Valerolactones and Related Valeric Acids in Human Urine on Consumption of Apples.</a></h1><p>Flavan-3-ols are dietary bioactive molecules that have beneficial effects on human health and reduce the risk of various diseases. Monomeric flavan-3-ols are rapidly absorbed in the small intestine and released in the blood stream as phase II conjugates. Polymeric flavan-3-ols are extensively metabolized by colonic gut  into phenyl-γ-valerolactones and their related phenylvaleric acids. These molecules are the main circulating metabolites in humans after the ingestion of flavan-3-ol rich-products; nevertheless, they have received less attention and their role is not understood yet. Here, we describe the quantification of 8 phenyl-γ-valerolactones and 3 phenylvaleric acids in the urine of 11 subjects on consumption of apples by using UHPLC-ESI-Triple Quad-MS with pure reference compounds. Phenyl-γ-valerolactones, mainly as sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugates, reached maximum excretion between 6 and 12 after apple consumption, with a decline thereafter. Significant differences were detected in the cumulative excretion rates within subjects and in the ratio of dihydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactone sulfate to glucuronide conjugates. This work observed for the first time the presence of two distinct metabotypes with regards to the excretion of phenyl-γ-valerolactone phase II conjugates.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654259>Gut -derived succinate: Friend or foe in human metabolic diseases?</a></h1><p>There is now a wealth of evidence showing that communication between  and the host is critical to sustain the vital functions of the healthy host, and disruptions of this homeostatic coexistence are known to be associated with a range of diseases including obesity and type 2 diabetes. -derived metabolites act both as nutrients and as messenger molecules and can signal to distant organs in the body to shape host pathophysiology. In this review, we provide a new perspective on succinate as a gut -derived metabolite with a key role governing intestinal homeostasis and energy metabolism. Thus, succinate is not merely a major intermediary of the TCA traditionally considered as an extracellular danger signal in the host, but also a by-product of some bacteria and a primary cross-feeding metabolite between gut resident microbes. In addition to maintain a healthy microbiome, specific functions of -derived succinate in peripheral tissues regulating host nutrient metabolism should not be rule out. Indeed, recent research point to some probiotic interventions directed to modulate succinate levels in the intestinal lumen, as a new -based therapies to treat obesity and related co-morbidities. While further research is essential, a large body of evidence point to succinate as a new strategic mediator in the -host cross-talk, which might provide the basis for new therapeutically approaches in a near future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649546>Inflammation in Renal Diseases: New and Old Players.</a></h1><p>Inflammation, a process intimately linked to renal disease, can be defined as a complex network of interactions between renal parenchymal cells and resident immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, coupled with recruitment of circulating monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate immunity pathways such as nuclear factor ĸB (NF-ĸB) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut  can influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut  and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal inflammation can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut  through the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸB inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric acid production, has been shown to decrease renal inflammation by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673547>Potential therapeutic strategies to target gut  in hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649181>Immune cells for  surveillance.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670066>Maternal exercise before and during pregnancy alleviates metabolic dysfunction associated with high-fat diet in pregnant mice, without significant changes in gut .</a></h1><p>Although maternal exercise before and during pregnancy is beneficial, the effects of exercise on  changes during pregnancy are unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that maternal exercise before and during pregnancy would positively affect glucose homeostasis, pancreatic cell function, and gut  dysbiosis in high-fat diet (HFD) fed dams. Female C57BL/6 mice were fed either a HFD or a low-fat diet (LFD) for 12 weeks. The HFD mice were split into two groups for 4 weeks prior to pregnancy initiation and throughout the pregnancy: sedentary (HFD) or exercised (HFD + Ex). Food intake, body weight, body composition, and glucose and insulin tolerance were measured. At gestation day 19, blood, pancreas, gonadal visceral and subcutaneous fat, plantaris muscle, and cecum were collected for analysis. Both HFD and HFD + Ex mice had impaired glucose clearance compared to LFD mice at 15 days of gestation. No changes were found in pancreatic α- or β-cell health. HFD + Ex mice had significantly reduced visceral fat mass, serum insulin, and leptin levels and increased high-density lipoprotein levels, compared to HFD-fed mice. In contrast to our hypothesis,  diversity and composition were not different among groups. The relative abundance of five bacterial phyla, such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Deferribacteres, and Actinobacteria, were not significantly altered with diet or exercise during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that maternal exercise prevents excess visceral fat accumulation, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia associated with a HFD, but not through the alterations of gut  composition or diversity during pregnancy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, it has been found that oral  are involved in arthritis pathogenesis. Microbiome composition and its functional implications have been associated with the prevention of bone loss and/or reducing fracture risk. The link between gut-oral  and joint inflammation in animal models of arthritis has been established, and it is now receiving increasing attention in human studies. Recent papers have demonstrated substantial alterations in the gut and oral  in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). These alterations resemble those established in systemic inflammatory conditions (inflammatory bowel disease, spondyloarthritides, and psoriasis), which include decreased microbial diversity and a disturbance of immunoregulatory properties. An association between abundance of oral  and intestinal  in RA patients compared to healthy controls has been clearly demonstrated. These new findings open important future horizons both for understanding disease pathophysiology and for developing novel biomarkers and treatment strategies. The changes and decreased diversity of oral and gut  seem to play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of RA and OA.

To explore the activated signaling pathways involved, we utilized AI-2 extracted from  to stimulate macrophages and validated these  findings in human CRC tissues. : The AI-2 concentration in both colorectal tissue and stool of CRC patients was significantly higher when compared to that in AD and NC (all  values < .01). The AI-2 concentration along with the progression of CRC in both tissues and stools was significantly increased (= .045，= .0003, respectively). After AI-2 stimulation, TNFSF9 was the most significantly increased protein in macrophage cells ( < .01). TNFSF9 expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues when compared to NCs (< .0001), which was mainly derived from macrophages in the tumor microenvironment.

There is an extensive interest in the potential role of the GM in different diseases including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and aging. The GM changes over the lifespan and is strongly associated with various age-related diseases.

To determine the role of  on longevity animal models, we investigated the changes in the GM of df/df and Normal control (N) mice, by comparing parents before mating and littermate mice at three distinct time points during early life. Furthermore, we studied the effects of a 6-month calorie restriction (CR), the most powerful intervention extending the lifespan. Our data revealed significant changes of the GM composition during early life development, and we detected differences in the abundance of some bacteria between df/df and N mice, already in early life. Overall, the variability of the  by genotype, time-point and breeding pair showed significant differences. In addition, CR caused significant changes in microbiome according to gastrointestinal (GI) location (distal colon, ileum and cecum), genotype and diet. However, the overall impact of the genotype was more prominent than that of the CR. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the gut  plays an important role during post-natal development in long-living df/df mice and CR dietary regimen can significantly modulate the GM.© The Author(s) 2019.

Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and B-cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory B-cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although B-cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the  in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health.

Rhodnius pallescens is a major vector of Chagas disease in Panama. Understanding the microbial ecology of disease vectors is important in the development of vector management strategies that target vector survival and fitness. In this study we examined the whole-body microbial composition of R. pallescens from three locations in Panama.We collected 89 R. pallescens specimens using Noireau traps in Attalea butyracea palms. We then extracted total DNA from whole-bodies of specimens and amplified bacterial  using 16S rRNA metabarcoding PCR.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is found to be closely involved in the regulation of gut microbial dynamics. However, it is still not clear how AhR signaling shapes the gut . In the present study, adult zebrafish were acutely exposed to an AhR antagonist (CH223191), an AhR agonist (polychlorinated biphenyl 126; PCB126) or their combination for 7 d. Overall intestinal health and gut microbial community were temporally monitored (1 d, 3 d and 7 d) and inter-compared among different groups. The results showed that single exposure to PCB126 significantly disrupted the overall health of intestines (i.e., neural signaling, inflammation, epithelial barrier integrity, oxidative stress). However, CH223191 failed to inhibit but enhanced the physiological toxicities of PCB126, implying the involvement of extra mechanisms rather than AhR in the regulation of intestinal physiological activities. Dysbiosis of gut  was also caused by PCB126 over time as a function of sex. It is intriguing that CH223191 successfully abolished the holistic effects of dioxin on gut , which inferred that growth of gut microbes was directly controlled by AhR activation without the involvement of host feedback modulation. When coming to detailed alterations at certain taxon, both antagonistic and synergistic interactions existed between CH223191 and dioxin, depending on fish sex, exposure duration and bacterial species. Correlation analysis found that gut inflammation was positively associated with pathogenic Legionella bacteria, but was negatively associated with epithelial barrier integrity, suggesting that integral intestinal epithelial barrier can prevent the influx of pathogenic bacteria to induce inflammatory response.

In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty acids in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar lipid mixtures, and milk fat globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic lipid concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut  in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut barrier function to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller. More research is warranted to clearly define how dietary milk SM influences lipid metabolism, gut , and inflammation in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Now, almost a century later, the adverse consequences of these highly effective drugs have become evident in the form of antibiotic-resistant infections, which are on the rise around the world. The search for solutions to this problem has involved both the introduction of newer types of antibiotics and, increasingly, the development of alternative strategies to prevent infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this article, we review the pathophysiological connection between the use of antibiotics and the occurrence of such infections. We also discuss some alternative strategies that are currently under development.This review is based on pertinent articles that appeared from January 2000 to April 2019 and were retrieved by a selective search in the PubMed database employing the search term "( OR microbiome) AND infection." Further suggestions by our author team regarding relevant literature were considered as well.The spectrum of preventive strategies encompasses measures for the protection of the intestinal  (antimicrobial stewardship, neutralization of antibiotic residues in the bowel, use of phages and species-specific antibiotics) as well as measures for its reconstitution (prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal  transfer).In view of the major problem that multidrug-resistant bacteria pose for the world's population and the resources now being spent on the search for a solution, derived both from public funding and from the pharmaceutical industry, we hope to see new, clinically useful approaches being developed and implemented in the near future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646077>Metformin as an archetype immuno-metabolic adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy.</a></h1><p>The development of a single immuno-metabolic adjuvant capable of modulating, in the appropriate direction and intensity, the complex antagonistic and symbiotic interplays between tumor cells, immune cells, and the gut  may appear pharmacologically implausible.

Most appealing are those interventions that seek to modify or supplement our diet through the addition of nutraceuticals. We now know that our diet, whether in the short- or long-term, is a major modifier of  composition and function. Of the various nutraceuticals, two categories; prebiotics and probiotics have received the greatest attention in basic research and product development. While our understanding of the impacts of prebiotics and probiotics on the indigenous  and host biology have been described in great detail in vitro and inanimal models, the clinical literature leaves much to be desired.

Recently, the role of the gut-brain axis (GBA) in psychiatric illness has emerged as a potential target for therapeutic exploration. However, studies concerning the role of the GBA in OCD are limited. To investigate whether a naturally occurring obsessive-compulsive-like phenotype in a rodent model, i.e. large nest-building in deer mice, is associated with perturbations in the gut microbiome, we investigated and characterized the gut  in specific pathogen free bred and housed large (LNB) and normal (NNB) nest building deer mice of both sexes (n = 11 per group, including 3 males and 8 females). Following baseline characterisation of nest building behaviour, a single faecal sample was collected from each animal and the gut  analysed. Our results reveal the overall microbial composition of LNB animals to be distinctly different compared to controls (PERMANOVA p < 0.05). While no genera were found to be significantly differentially abundant after correcting for multiple comparisons, the normal phenotype showed a higher loading of Prevotella and Anaeroplasma, while the OC-phenotype demonstrated a higher loading of Desulfovermiculus, Aestuariispira, Peptococcus and Holdemanella (cut-off threshold for loading at 0.2 in either the first or second component of the PCA). These findings not only provide proof-of-concept for continued investigation of the GBA in OCD, but also highlight a potential underlying etiological association between alterations in the gut  and the natural development of obsessive-compulsive-like behaviours.© 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652348>Nod-like receptors are critical for gut-brain axis signalling in mice.</a></h1><p>Nod-like receptors regulate cognition, anxiety, and HPA-axis activation Nod-like receptors regulate central and peripheral serotonergic biology Nod-like receptors are important for maintenance of GI physiology Intestinal epithelial cell expression of Nod1 receptors regulate behaviour ABSTRACT: Gut-brain axis signalling is critical for maintaining health and homeostasis. Stressful life events can impact gut-brain signalling, leading to altered mood, cognition and intestinal dysfunction. Here we identify nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (Nod)-like receptors (NLR), Nod1 and Nod2, as novel regulators for gut-brain signalling. NLR are innate immune pattern recognition receptors expressed in the gut and brain, important in the regulation of gastrointestinal (GI) physiology. We found that mice deficient in both Nod1 and Nod2 (NodDKO) demonstrate signs of stress-induced anxiety, cognitive impairment and depression in the context of a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. These deficits were coupled with impairments in the serotonergic pathway in the brain, decreased hippocampal cell proliferation and immature neurons, as well as reduced neural activation. In addition, NodDKO mice had increased GI permeability and altered serotonin signalling in the gut following exposure to acute stress. Administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, abrogated behavioral impairments and restored serotonin signalling. We also identified that intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of Nod1 (VilCre Nod1 ), but not Nod2, increased susceptibility to stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour and cognitive impairment following exposure to stress. Together these data suggest that intestinal epithelial NLR are novel modulators of gut-brain communication and may serve as potential novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of gut-brain disorders.

Thirty-two conventional M. hyopneumoniae free piglets were randomly selected from six different litters at 3 weeks of age and were experimentally inoculated with M. hyopneumoniae at 8 weeks of age. Lung lesion scores (LS) were recorded 4 weeks post-inoculation (12 weeks of age) from piglet lungs at necropsy. Fecal bacterial community composition of piglets at 3, 8 and 12 weeks of age were targeted by amplifying the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The LS ranged from 0.3 to 43% with an evident clustering of the scores observed in piglets within litters. There were significant differences in species richness and alpha diversity in fecal microbiomes among piglets within litters at different time points (p < 0.05). The dissimilarity matrices indicated that at 3 weeks of age, the fecal  of piglets was more dissimilar compared to those from 8 to 12 weeks of age. Specific groups of bacteria in the gut that might predict the decreased severity of M. hyopneumoniae associated lesions were identified. The microbial shift at 3 weeks of age was observed to be driven by the increase in abundance of the indicator family, Ruminococcaceae in piglets with low LS (p < 0.05). The taxa, Ruminococcus_2 having the highest richness scores, correlated significantly between litters showing stronger associations with the lowest LS (r = -0.49, p = 0.005). These findings suggest that early life gut  can be a potential determinant for M. hyopneumoniae susceptibility in pigs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671546>Does the  Play a Pivotal Role in the Pathogenesis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome?</a></h1><p>The microbial community that lives in the human body, called the , consists of a large variety of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi, eukaryotes and archae [...].</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654707>Intra-amniotic administration (Gallus gallus) of TiO, SiO, and ZnO nanoparticles affect brush border membrane functionality and alters gut microflora populations.</a></h1><p>Metal oxide nanoparticles (NP) are increasingly used in the food and agriculture industries, making human consumption nearly unavoidable. The goal of this study was to use the Gallus gallus (broiler chicken) intra-amniotic administration of physiologically relevant concentrations of TiO, SiO, and ZnO to better understand the effects of NP exposure on gut health and function. Immediately after hatch, blood, cecum, and small intestine were collected for assessment of iron (Fe)-metabolism, zinc (Zn)-metabolism, brush border membrane (BBM) functional, and pro-inflammatory related proteins gene expression; blood Fe and Zn levels; cecum weight; and the relative abundance of intestinal microflora. NP type, dose, and the presence or absence of minerals was shown to result in altered mineral transporter, BBM functional, and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Metal oxide NP also altered the abundance of intestinal bacterial populations. Overall, the data suggest that the in vivo results align with in vitro studies, and that NP have the potential to negatively affect intestinal functionality and health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To study underlying biological mechanisms and factors that influence the intestinal  development, longitudinal data from flocks and individual birds is needed. However, post-mortem collection of samples hampers longitudinal data collection. In this study, invasively collected cecal and ileal content, cloacal swabs collected from the same bird, and boot sock samples and cecal droppings from the litter of the broilers' poultry house, were collected on days 0, 2, 7, 14 and 35 post-hatch. The different sample types were evaluated on their applicability and reliability to characterize the broiler intestinal . The  of 247 samples was assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Analyses of α and β measures showed a similar development of  composition of cecal droppings compared to cecal content. Furthermore, the composition of cecal content samples was comparable to that of the boot socks until day 14 post-hatch. This study shows that the value of non-invasive sample types varies at different ages and depends on the goal of the  characterization. Specifically, cecal droppings and boot socks may be useful alternatives for cecal samples to determine intestinal  composition longitudinally.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673757>Resolution of acute intestinal graft-versus-host disease.</a></h1><p>Allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (allo-HCT) represents an increasingly employed therapeutic approach to potentially cure patients suffering from life-threatening malignant and autoimmune disorders. Despite its lifesaving potential, immune-mediated allo-reactivity inherent to the allogeneic transplantation can be observed within up to 50% of all allo-HCT patients regularly resulting in the manifestation of acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Mechanistically, especially donor T cells are assumed to chiefly drive inflammation that can occur in virtually all organs, with the skin, liver, and gut representing as the most frequently affected anatomic sites. Especially in the presence of intestinal manifestations of GvHD, the risk that the disease takes a life-threatening, potentially fatal course is significantly increased. In the light of a rapid gain of knowledge in respect to decode innate and adaptive immunity related mechanisms as, e.g., cytokine networks, intracellular signaling pathways or environmental triggers as, e.g., the intestinal  and the development of novel therapeutic approaches, detailed insight into endogenous mechanisms seeking to counterbalance the proinflammatory machinery or to proactively foster signals promoting the resolution of allo-driven intestinal inflammation is emerging. Here, we seek to highlight the key aspects of those mechanisms involved in and contributing to the resolution of GvHD-associated intestinal inflammation. Concomitantly, we would like to briefly outline and discuss promising future experimental targets suitable to be therapeutically employed to directionally deflect the tissue response from a proinflammatory to an inflammation-resolving type of intestinal GvHD after allo-HCT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652955>An Association of Gut  with Different Phenotypes in Chinese Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.</a></h1><p>We aimed to investigate the association of gut  with disease activity, inflammatory parameters, and auto-antibodies profile in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A total of 138 RA patients and 21 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. Fecal samples were collected for bacterial DNA extraction and 16S ribosome (r)RNA sequencing, followed by analyses of gut  composition. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-17A were determined by using ELISA. Our results indicated that RA patients had lower diversity index, which reflects both evenness and richness of gut , compared to HC. The alpha-diversity was lower in anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA)-positive patients than in HC. The phylum  and genus  were more abundant in patients compared to HC. There was increased relative abundance of  as well as , and less abundance of  in patients with high levels of TNF-α or IL-17A compared to those who had low levels of these cytokines. In addition, ACPA-positive patients had higher proportions of , , and  than ACPA-negative patients.

Two of the four rhinoceros species in human care, Sumatran rhinoceros () and black rhinoceros (), are susceptible, whereas the other two, white rhinoceros () and greater one-horned (GOH) rhinoceros (), are relatively resistant to IOD. Complex interrelationships exist between mammalian hosts, their indigenous gut , metabolome, physical condition, and iron availability. The goal of this study was to gain insight into these relationships within the family Rhinocerotidae. Specific objectives were to (1) characterize the gut microbiome and metabolome of four rhinoceros species; (2) compare the microbiome and metabolome of IOD-susceptible and IOD-resistant rhinoceros species; and (3) identify variation in the microbiome and metabolome associated with compromised health or disease in IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses. Fecal samples were collected from 31 rhinoceroses (Sumatran rhinoceros,  = 3; black rhinoceros,  = 6; GOH rhinoceros,  = 9; white rhinoceros,  = 13) located at five facilities, and matched fecal aliquots were processed for microbiome and metabolome analyses using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. Despite the phylogenetic disparity and dissimilar zoo diets of the hosts, the structure of the fecal  of the two IOD-susceptible rhinoceros species were more closely related to each other than to those of the two IOD-resistant species (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity; IOD-susceptible vs. IOD-resistant -value < 0.001). In addition, IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses exhibited less microbial diversity than their IOD-resistant relatives (Shannon diversity; -value < 0.001) which could have health implications. Of note, the black rhinoceros was distinct among the four rhinoceros species with the most divergent fecal metabolome; interestingly, it contained higher concentrations of short chain fatty acids. Neither age nor sex were associated with differences in microbial community composition ( = 0.253 and 0.488, respectively) or fecal metabolomic profile ( = 0.634 and 0.332, respectively). Differences in the distal gut microbiomes between IOD-resistant and IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses support hypotheses that gut microbes play a role in host iron acquisition, and further studies and experiments to test these hypotheses are warranted.Copyright © 2019 Roth, Switzer, Watanabe-Chailland, Bik, Relman, Romick-Rosendale and Ollberding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650414>Effects of the Probiotic Candidate E. faecalis-1, the Poulvac E. coli Vaccine, and their Combination on Growth Performance, Caecal Microbial Composition, Immune Response, and Protection against E. coli O78 Challenge in Broiler Chickens.</a></h1><p>The present study was performed on 180-day-old commercial Cobb chicks to assess the effects of the probiotic candidate Enterococcus faecalis-1, the Poulvac Escherichia coli vaccine, and their combination on growth parameters, intestinal microbial composition, immune response, and protection against challenge with the avian pathogen E. coli O78. The experimental groups were as follows: G1, basal diet; G2, basal diet and challenge with O78 at 28 days of growth; G3, basal diet, vaccination with Poulvac (1 and 15 days), and challenge with O78 at 28 days of growth; G4, basal diet, E. faecalis-1 supplementation for the first 3 days of growth, and challenge with O78 at 28 days of growth; G5, basal diet, E. faecalis-1 supplementation for the first 3 days of growth, vaccination with Poulvac (1 and 15 days), and challenge with O78 at 28 days of growth; G6, basal diet and E. faecalis-1 supplementation for the first 3 days of growth.

This study aimed to investigate whether the cattle breed affects specific ruminal taxonomic microbial groups and functions associated with feed conversion ratio (FCR), using two genetically related Angus breeds as a model. Total RNA was extracted from 24 rumen content samples collected from purebred Black and Red Angus bulls fed the same forage diet and then subjected to metatranscriptomic analysis. Multivariate discriminant analysis (sparse partial least square discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA)) and analysis of composition of microbiomes were conducted to identify microbial signatures characterizing Black and Red Angus cattle. Our analyses revealed relationships among bacterial signatures, host breeds and FCR. Although Black and Red Angus are genetically similar, sPLS-DA detected 25 bacterial species and 10 functions that differentiated the rumen microbial signatures between those two breeds. In Black Angus, we identified bacterial taxa Chitinophaga pinensis, Clostridium stercorarium and microbial functions with large and small subunits ribosomal proteins L16 and S7 exhibiting a higher abundance in the rumen microbiome. In Red Angus, nonetheless, we identified the poorly characterized bacterial taxon Oscillibacter valericigenes with a higher abundance and pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism. Analysis of composition of microbiomes revealed that C. pinensis and C. stercorarium exhibited a higher abundance in Black Angus compared to Red Angus associated with FCR, suggesting that these bacterial species may play a key role in the feed conversion efficiency of forage-fed bulls. This study highlights how the discovery of signatures of bacterial taxa and their functions can be used to harness the full potential of the rumen microbiome in Angus cattle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655168>Sepsis roadmap: What we know, what we learned, and where we are going.</a></h1><p>Sepsis is a life-threatening condition originating as a result of systemic blood infection causing, one or more organ damage due to the dysregulation of the immune response.

What constitutes a unique feature of this model is its twofold objective of introducing an ileal microbial community and mimicking a dietary weaning transition. This model should then be ideally suited to test the dietary weaning strategies of piglets in vitro. Regarding the , the main phyla making up the model were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria although Bacteroidetes decreased after inoculation (p = 0.043 in ileum, p = 0.021 in colon) and Delta-Proteobacteria were favoured (p = 0.083 in ileum, p = 0.043 in colon) compared to Gamma-Proteobacteria. The designed model led to a low representation of Bacilli - especially Lactobacillus sp. in the ileum and a weak representation of Bacteroidia in the proximal colon. However, Mitsuokella and Prevotella were part of the major genera of the model along with Bifidobacterium, Fusobacterium, Megasphaera and Bacteroides. As a result of weaning, two major changes - normally occurring in vivo - were detected in the system: firstly, Firmicutes diminished when Bacteroidetes increased particularly in the proximal colon; secondly, Bacteroides decreased and Prevotella increased (mean value for four runs). In terms of metabolite production, while a ratio acetate: propionate: butyrate of 60:26:14 was obtained in post-weaned colon, the expected inversion of the ratio propionate: butyrate in the post-weaned ileum was unfortunately not observed. To conclude, the so-called baby-SPIME model meets expectations regarding the resident  of the proximal colon bioreactor and the metabolites produced thereof. In terms of the evolution of major groups of bacteria, the in vitro weaning process appeared to be successful. However, higher concentration of butyric acid would have been expected in ileum part of newly weaned piglets, as observed in vivo. The  in the ileum bioreactor seemed in fact to act like a pre-colon. This suggests that microbial profile in ileum bioreactor had to be improved.Copyright © 2019.

The causative organism, Paenibacillus larvae, attacks honey bee brood and renders entire hives dysfunctional during active disease states, but more commonly resides in hives asymptomatically as inactive spores that elude even vigilant beekeepers. The mechanism of this pathogenic transition is not fully understood, and no cure exists for AFB. Here, we evaluated how hive supplementation with probiotic lactobacilli (delivered through a nutrient patty; BioPatty) affected colony resistance towards a naturally occurring AFB outbreak. Results demonstrated a significantly lower pathogen load and proteolytic activity of honey bee larvae from BioPatty-treated hives. Interestingly, a distinctive shift in the  composition of adult nurse bees occurred irrespective of treatment group during the monitoring period, but only vehicle-supplemented nurse bees exhibited higher P. larvae loads. In vitro experiments utilizing laboratory-reared honey bee larvae showed Lactobacillus plantarum Lp39, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1, and Lactobacillus kunkeei BR-1 (contained in the BioPatty) could reduce pathogen load, upregulate expression of key immune genes, and improve survival during P. larvae infection. These findings suggest the usage of a lactobacilli-containing hive supplement, which is practical and affordable for beekeepers, may be effective for reducing enzootic pathogen-related hive losses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654910>The mycobiota: fungi take their place between plants and bacteria.</a></h1><p>Eukaryotes host numerous intracellular and associated microbes in their .

In this review, we will discuss the prevalence and current options available to treat IFI, including recent reports of drug resistance. Nevertheless, the main focus of this review is to describe the glycobiology of human fungal pathogens and how various components of the fungal cell wall, particularly cell wall polysaccharides and glycoconjugates, are involved in fungal pathogenicity, their biosynthesis and how they can be potentially exploited to develop novel antifungal treatment options.

Distinct bacterial communities may create very different "niches", some permissive and others inhibitory for myelin generation or maintenance. We speculate that this concept of "gut dysbiosis" may also in part explain the reduced myelin content detected in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. We conclude by envisioning intervention with probiotics and prebiotics to favor the formation of a microbial metabolic "niche" favoring myelin production to promote brain health.Copyright © 2019.

The cause and treatment has not been wholly elucidated. Some reports infer that CG is mainly associated with dental infection but no firm or reliable microbiological evidence has been provided for a causative organism. This study aimed to evaluate whether microorganisms contribute to the etiology of CG in order to inform appropriate treatment op tions in clinic.Unstimulated saliva was collected from 15 CG patients who were diagnosed clinically and pathologically and 15 healthy controls (HC). DNA was extracted from the precipitate of the centrifuged saliva for 16s rRNA high-throughput sequencing using the Miseq PE300 platform. The distribution of the microbiome between the two groups was compared.CG patients had a greater microbial flora that was more diverse than the HC. Prevotella, Alloprevotella, Porphyromonas, Actinomyces, Rothia, Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, and Aggregatibacter had a significantly higher abundance in CG patients. In contrast, Streptococcus and Campylobacter were the most abundant genera in HC with a mean relative abundance of 63% and 2%, respectively. The microbiological network indicated that most of the bacteria that were enriched at greater levels in CG patients were likely to be Prevotella, Actinomyces, and Rothia. These have been shown to co-exist with other bacteria.The composition and structure of bacterial communities in CG patients were different from HC. Most of the genera observed in CG patients were associated with periodontitis and pulp infection. These findings might be helpful in understanding the etiology of CG. Further study will be needed to confirm these findings and explore the underlying pathological mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647207>Autophagy: A Novel Mechanism Involved in the Anti-Inflammatory Abilities of Probiotics.</a></h1><p>Deregulation of the complex interaction among host genetics, gut  and environmental factors on one hand and aberrant immune responses on the other hand, are known to be associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease. Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

According to Dickson's conceptual model, the lung  (LMt) is a dynamic ecosystem, whose composition, in healthy lungs, is likely to reflect microbial migration, reproduction, and elimination. However, which microbial genera constitutes a "healthy microbiome" per se remains hotly debated. It is now widely accepted that a bi-directional gut-lung axis connects the intestinal with the pulmonary  and that the diet could have a role in modulating both microbiotas as in health as in pathological status. The LMt is altered in numerous respiratory disorders such as obstructive airway diseases, interstitial lung diseases, infections, and lung cancer. Some authors hypothesize that the use of specific bacterial strains, termed "probiotics," with positive effects on the host immunity and/or against pathogens, could have beneficial effects in the treatment of intestinal disorders and pulmonary diseases. In this manuscript, we have reviewed the literature available on the LMt to delineate and discuss the potential relationship between composition alterations of LMt and lung diseases. Finally, we have reported some meaningful clinical studies that used integrated probiotics' treatments to contrast some lung-correlated disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662087>Altered trophic interactions in warming climates: consequences for predator diet breadth and fitness.</a></h1><p>Species interactions are central in predicting the impairment of biodiversity with climate change. Trophic interactions may be altered through climate-dependent changes in either predator food preferences or prey communities. Yet, climate change impacts on predator diet remain surprisingly poorly understood. We experimentally studied the consequences of 2°C warmer climatic conditions on the trophic niche of a generalist lizard predator. We used a system of semi-natural mesocosms housing a variety of invertebrate species and in which climatic conditions were manipulated. Lizards in warmer climatic conditions ate at a greater predatory to phytophagous invertebrate ratio and had smaller individual dietary breadths. These shifts mainly arose from direct impacts of climate on lizard diets rather than from changes in prey communities. Dietary changes were associated with negative changes in fitness-related traits (body condition, gut ) and survival. We demonstrate that climate change alters trophic interactions through top-predator dietary shifts, which might disrupt eco-evolutionary dynamics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650828>A new histological method to study oral soft tissue penetrability to iodine and optimize oral use of iodine solutions.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662859>Gut microbiome in chronic rheumatic and inflammatory bowel diseases: Similarities and differences.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and chronic rheumatic diseases (CRDs) are systemic chronic disorders sharing common genetic, immune and environmental factors. About half of patients with IBD develop rheumatic ailments and microscopic intestinal inflammation is present in up to half of CRD patients. IBD and CRD patients also share a common therapeutic armamentarium. Disequilibrium in the complex realm of microbes (known as dysbiosis) that closely interact with the gut mucosal immune system has been associated with both IBD and CRD (spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis). Whether dysbiosis represents an epiphenomenon or a prodromal feature remains to be determined.In an attempt to further investigate whether specific gut dysbiosis may be the missing link between IBD and CRD in patients developing both diseases, we performed here a systematic literature review focusing on studies looking at bacterial  in CRD and/or IBD patients.We included 80 studies, with a total of 3799 IBD patients without arthritis, 1084 CRD patients without IBD, 132 IBD patients with arthropathy manifestations and 12 spondyloarthritis patients with IBD history. Overall, this systematic review indicates that an increase in s,  and  genera, as well as a decrease in  genera and species belonging to Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria phyla are common features in IBD and CRD patients, whereas dozens of bacterial species are specific features of CRD and IBD.Further work is needed to understand the functions of bacteria and of their metabolites but also to characterize fungi and viruses that are commonly found in these patients.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674784>L-Arabinose inhibits colitis by modulating gut  in mice.</a></h1><p>L-Arabinose is a monosaccharide extracted from plants or fibers, which is known to have a variety of functional properties. In this study, we aim to investigate whether L-Arabinose could inhibit colitis by modulating gut . L-Arabinose was administrated in mice daily in a DSS-induced colitis model. The histological analysis, disease index and the expression of inflammatory genes were measured. 16S-rRNA sequence analysis was performed to investigate gut . Intriguingly, we found that L-Arabinose could repress DSS-induced colitis and inhibit p38-/p65-dependent inflammation activation. Besides that, our data revealed that L-Arabinose modulated gut  disturbed by DSS treatment. Additionally, by antibiotic treatment, the perturbed gut  was responsible for the suppressive effects of L-Arabinose on DSS-induced colitis. Lastly, Caco-2 cells was used to confirm the protective effects of L-Arabinose. As expected, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory proteins in Caco-2 cells treated with L-Arabinose in absence or presence of TNFα. Our work suggested that L-Arabinose exert anti-inflammation effect in DSS-induced colitis. These beneficial effects may be related to the diversity and composition of the gut  regulated by L-Arabinose.

In the past, a great limitation in studying  composition was the low sensitivity of sequencing technologies and that few computational approaches were sufficient to thoroughly analyse the whole microbiome. However, new cutting-edge technologies in nucleic acid sequencing, -omics analysis and the innovative statistics and bioinformatics pipelines made possible more sensitive and accurate metagenomics, ultimately identifying novel players in intestinal inflammation, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, that together form the gut virome. The discovery of peculiar inflammatory bowel disease-associated microbial strains will not only shed new light on inflammatory bowel disease aetiogenesis, they may also support the development of novel therapeutic strategies not merely treating symptoms, but precisely counteracting the primary cause of chronic intestinal inflammation.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671239>Duck Egg White-Derived Peptide VSEE (Val-Ser-Glu-Glu) Regulates bone and lipid Metabolisms by Wnt/β-catenin Signaling Pathway and Intestinal .</a></h1><p>Val-Ser-Glu-Glu (VSEE), identified from duck egg white peptides, has been proved to facilitate calcium absorption in previous study. Since prevention of osteoporosis is important, it might act as a potential cofactor in osteoporosis prevention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of VSEE on osteoporosis and abnormal lipid metabolisms.MC3T3-E1 cell and OVX rat model were used to evaluate VSEE on regulation of bone and lipid metabolisms. Differentiation and matrix mineralization of preosteoblast were significantly increased by VSEE (P <0.05), which attributed to stimulating calcium influx, then to activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and regulating runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). VSEE could cross Caco-2/HT-29 co-cultured monolayer via paracellular pathway and peptide transporter (PepT1), and could be detected in blood and maximum concentration was 122.84± 3.68 mg/L at 60 min. Additionally, VSEE was found to reverse bone loss and regulate dyslipidemia through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in OVX rats.

The significant compositional differences in taxonomic profiles among different mouse strains due to gastrointestinal locations, genotypes and vendors have been well documented.

This study compiled and analyzed 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomic profiles of 554 healthy mouse samples from 14 different projects to construct a comprehensive database of the microbiome of a healthy mouse gastrointestinal tract. The database, named Murine Microbiome Database, should provide researchers with useful taxonomic information and better biological insight about how each taxon, such as genus and species, is associated with locations in the gastrointestinal tract, genotypes and vendors.

Several sample types have been used to investigate the lung , each presenting specific challenges for preparation and analysis of microbial communities. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) enables the identification of  specific to the lower lung but commonly has low bacterial density, increasing the risk of false-positive signal from contaminating DNA. The objectives of this study were to investigate the extent of contamination across a range of sample densities representative of BALF and identify features of contaminants that facilitate their removal from sequence data and aid in the interpretation of BALF sample 16S sequencing data.Using three mock communities across a range of densities ranging from 8E+ 02 to 8E+ 09 16S copies/ml, we assessed taxonomic accuracy and precision by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the proportion of reads arising from contaminants. Sequencing accuracy, precision, and the relative abundance of mock community members decreased with sample input density, with a significant drop-off below 8E+ 05 16S copies/ml. Contaminant OTUs were commonly inversely correlated with sample input density or not reproduced between technical replicates. Removal of taxa with these features or physical concentration of samples prior to sequencing improved both sequencing accuracy and precision for samples between 8E+ 04 and 8E+ 06 16S copies/ml. For the lowest densities, below 8E+ 03 16S copies/ml BALF, accuracy and precision could not be significantly improved using these approaches. Using clinical BALF samples across a large density range, we observed that OTUs with features of contaminants identified in mock communities were also evident in low-density BALF samples.Relative abundance data and community composition generated by 16S sequencing of BALF samples across the range of density commonly observed in this sample type should be interpreted in the context of input sample density and may be improved by simple pre- and post-sequencing steps for densities above 8E+ 04 16S copies/ml.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652153>Exercise and lifestyle changes in pediatric asthma.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this review is to discuss the most recent studies on lifestyle interventions in pediatric asthma. We include studies on physical activity and exercise, sedentary time, nutrition, behavioral therapy and the role of schools.Several small studies in children with asthma suggest that exercise interventions can improve aerobic fitness, asthma symptoms or control and quality of life. Existing evidence supports recommending higher intake of fruits and vegetables for asthma risk and control. In contrast, the 'Western diet' - high in refined grains, highly processed foods, red meats and fried foods with low intake of fruits and vegetables - has a proinflammatory effect and may alter  composition leading to worse asthma outcomes. Finally, there are opportunities to utilize schools to promote physical activity, though standardization of asthma management in the schools is needed.Assessing physical activity/fitness levels, sedentary time and nutritional status is important in the management of children with asthma, as they are modifiable factors.

However, our understanding of the changes induced by TP on MO challenged layers performances and oxidative status, and on the , remains limited. The aim of the present study was to better understand host (performances and redox balance) and  responses in MO-challenged layers with dietary TP. In this study, 200 Lohmann laying hens (65-week-old) were randomly allocated in a 2 × 2 factorial design to receive a diet with or without MO (0 or 100 mg/kg), and supplemented with either 0 or 600 mg/kg TP. The results indicate that 100 mg/kg MO decreased egg production ( = 0.03), while dietary TP increased egg production in MO challenged layers ( < 0.01). Egg yolk color was decreased by high MO ( < 0.01), while dietary TP had no effect on yolk color ( > 0.05). Serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration were increased by high MO, while total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), xanthine oxidase (XOD) activity, glutathione s-transferase (GSH-ST), and glutathione concentration in serum were decreased ( < 0.05). Dietary TP was able to reverse the increasing effect of MO on ALT and AST ( < 0.05). High MO resulted in higher MO levels in serum, liver, kidney, and egg, but it decreased Cu and Se content in serum, liver, and egg ( < 0.05). The Fe concentration in liver, kidney, and eggs was significantly lower in MO supplementation groups ( < 0.05). High MO levels in the diet led to lower  and higher  abundance, whereas dietary TP alone and/or in high MO treatment increased the  abundance and the  ratio at phylum level. High MO increased the abundance of  (phylum),  (class),  (order), and  (family), whereas dietary TP promoted the enrichment of  (species). Dietary TP also enhanced the enrichment of  (class),  (order),  (family), and  (species).  analysis revealed differentially enriched microbial compositions in the cecum caused by MO and TP, which might be responsible for the protective effect of dietary TP during a MO challenge.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659416>Kynurenic acid and cancer: facts and controversies.</a></h1><p>Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an endogenous tryptophan metabolite exerting neuroprotective and anticonvulsant properties in the brain.

The  also interacts with and metabolizes compounds produced by the host, such as primary bile acids. Lactate and bile acids (BA) are of particular interest in gastrointestinal diseases because they have been associated with metabolic acidosis and bile acid diarrhea, respectively. The objectives of this study were to validate an enzymatic assay to quantify D-, L-, and total lactate in canine feces, and to characterize fecal lactate and BA concentrations as well as bacterial abundances in healthy dogs and dogs with gastrointestinal diseases. Fecal samples were collected from 34 healthy dogs, 15 dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE), and 36 dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Lactate was quantified with an enzymatic assay, BA with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 11 bacterial groups with qPCR. A fecal lactate reference interval was established from 34 healthy dogs and was 0.7-1.4 mM, 0.3-6.0 mM, and 1.0-7.0 mM for D-, L-, and total lactate, respectively. The assay to measure D-, L-, and total lactate in canine fecal samples was linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible. Significant increases in fecal lactate and decreases in secondary BA concentrations were observed in dogs with CE and dogs with EPI. Dogs with EPI had an increased abundance of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium; a decreased abundance of Fusobacterium and Clostridium hiranonis; and a higher Dysbiosis Index when compared to healthy dogs. Further studies are necessary to determine the clinical utility of lactate and BA quantification in canine feces. These metabolites suggest functional alterations of intestinal dysbiosis and may become promising targets for further elucidating the role of the  in health and disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649943>Endodontic Microbiome of Fractured Non-vital Teeth in Dogs Determined by 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing.</a></h1><p>Dental fractures resulting in pulp exposure will lead to an endodontic infection with microbes from the oral cavity.

However, chronic TMP use drives development of antibiotic resistance (increasing likelihood of subsequent infections) and disrupts the gut  (linked to autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases), tempering translational excitement of this approach in model systems and for treating human diseases. Herein, we identified a TMP-based, non-antibiotic small molecule, termed 14a (MCC8529), and tested its ability to control multiple DHFR-based reporters and signaling proteins. We found that 14a is non-toxic and can effectively stabilize DHFR DDs expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, 14a crosses the blood-retinal barrier and stabilizes DHFR DDs expressed in the mouse eye with kinetics comparable to that of TMP (≤6 h). Surprisingly, 14a stabilized a DHFR DD in the liver significantly better than TMP did, while having no effect on the mouse gut . Our results suggest that alternative small-molecule DHFR DD stabilizers (such as 14a) may be ideal substitutes for TMP in instances when conditional, non-antibiotic control of protein abundance is desired in the eye and beyond.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653062>Microbial Metabolites Determine Host Health and the Status of Some Diseases.</a></h1><p>The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a highly complex organ composed of the intestinal epithelium layer, intestinal , and local immune system. Intestinal  residing in the GI tract engages in a mutualistic relationship with the host. Different sections of the GI tract contain distinct proportions of the intestinal , resulting in the presence of unique bacterial products in each GI section. The intestinal  converts ingested nutrients into metabolites that target either the intestinal  population or host cells. Metabolites act as messengers of information between the intestinal  and host cells. The intestinal  composition and resulting metabolites thus impact host development, health, and pathogenesis. Many recent studies have focused on modulation of the gut  and their metabolites to improve host health and prevent or treat diseases. In this review, we focus on the production of microbial metabolites, their biological impact on the intestinal  composition and host cells, and the effect of microbial metabolites that contribute to improvements in inflammatory bowel diseases and metabolic diseases.

The study explored changes in the faecal  and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) associated with the diet (including nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs)) and evaluated metabolic consequences in subjects with morbid obesity. The diet was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. One unit of NNSs was 100 mL beverage with NNSs or 2 tablets/teaspoons of NNSs. The faecal  was assessed with GA-map® dysbiosis test and SCFA with gas chromatography and flame ionisation detection. Fourteen men and 75 women with a mean age of 44.6 (SD 8.7) years, BMI 41.8 (SD 3.6) kg/m, and intake of NNSs 7.5 units/day (SD 3.2; range 0-43) were included. Faecal butyric acid was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric acid has antiobesogenic effects, reduces insulin resistance, and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the weight-reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose weight is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric acid.Copyright © 2019 Per G.

Gut  play pivotal roles in mediating psychological behaviors by regulating gut barrier integrity and systemic inflammatory responses. Here, we found that oral sesamin administration (50 mg/kg·bodyweight/day) significantly attenuated depressive, aversive, repetitive, and anxiety-like behaviors in a long-term multiple nonsocial stress-treated mice model. Sesamin inhibited stress-induced gut barrier integrity damage, reduced circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, and suppressed neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, sesamin treatment also restructured the gut microbiome by enhancing the relative abundances of Bacteroidales and S24-7. The correlation analysis indicated that the  composition changes were strongly correlated with behavioral disorders, serotonin, norepinephrine, and LPS levels. In conclusion, sesamin has preventive effects on stress-induced behavioral and psychological disorders, which might be highly related to the reshaped  composition.

Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root , including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic  to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we show that the development of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells relies on a specific temporal window, after which MAIT cell development is permanently impaired. This imprinting depends on early-life exposure to defined microbes that synthesize riboflavin-derived antigens. In adults, cutaneous MAIT cells are a dominant population of interleukin-17A (IL-17A)-producing lymphocytes, which display a distinct transcriptional signature and can subsequently respond to skin commensals in an IL-1-, IL-18-, and antigen-dependent manner. Consequently, local activation of cutaneous MAIT cells promotes wound healing. Together, our work uncovers a privileged interaction between defined members of the  and MAIT cells, which sequentially controls both tissue-imprinting and subsequent responses to injury.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In this study, the ability of  heteropolysaccharide (GFP) to ameliorate NAFLD was investigated in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The molecular mechanisms modulating the expression of specific gene members related to lipid synthesis and conversion, cholesterol metabolism, and inflammation pathways were determined. The components of the intestinal microflora in rats were analyzed by high-throughput next-generation 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

These interactions take place in a highly complex chemical landscape, the intestinal eco-active chemosphere, composed of chemical substances that positively or negatively influence bacterial growth, including those originated from nutrient uptake, and those produced by the action of the human or animal host and the intestinal microbiome. The contribution of bacteria results from their effect on the host generated molecules, on food and digested food, and organic substances from microbial origin, including from bacterial degradation. Here, we comprehensively review the main chemical substances present in the human intestinal chemosphere, particularly of those having inhibitory effects on microorganisms. With this background, and focusing on , the most relevant human pathogens from the intestinal , the microcin's history and classification, mechanisms of action, and mechanisms involved in microcin's immunity (in microcin producers) and resistance (non-producers) are reviewed. Products from the chemosphere likely modulate the ecological effects of microcin activity. Several cross-resistance mechanisms are shared by microcins, colicins, bacteriophages, and some conventional antibiotics, which are expected to produce cross-effects. Double-microcin-producing strains (such as microcins MccM and MccH47) have been successfully used for decades in the control of pathogenic gut organisms. Microcins are associated with successful gut colonization, facilitating translocation and invasion, leading to bacteremia, and urinary tract infections. In fact,  strains from the more invasive phylogroups (e.g., B2) are frequently microcinogenic. A publicly accessible APD3 database http://aps.unmc.edu/AP/ shows particular genes encoding microcins in 34.1% of .  strains (mostly MccV, MccM, MccH47, and MccI47), and much less in  and  (<2%). Some 4.65% of  are microcinogenic (mostly with MccE492), and even less in  or  (mostly MccS). The high frequency and variety of microcins in some  indicate key ecological functions, a notion supported by their dominance in the intestinal  of biosynthetic gene clusters involved in the synthesis of post-translationally modified peptide microcins.Copyright © 2019 Baquero, Lanza, Baquero, del Campo and Bravo-Vázquez.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649629>Similar Shift Patterns in Gut Bacterial and Fungal Communities Across the Life Stages of  Larvae From Two Field Populations.</a></h1><p> (Enderlein) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is an oligophagous insect pest that damages citrus fruit, especially in China. Due to larvae living within a highly septic environment, a wide variety of microorganisms exist in the larval gut of . However, a systematic study of the intestinal  of this harmful insect pest is still lacking. Here, we comprehensively investigated the larval gut  of  in two field populations from Zigui (developed in orange) and Danjiangkou (developed in mandarin orange). We observed a dominance of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in these bacterial communities, and Enterobacteriaceae was the predominant family throughout the larval stage. However, most of the identified fungal sequences were annotated as being from either Ascomycota or Basidiomycota phyla. Although there was a difference in the structure of the microbial communities between the two populations, the dynamic change patterns of most of the members of the  were similar across the lifespan of larvae in both populations. The relative abundances of the Acetobacteraceae, Leuconostocaceae, and Lactobacillaceae gut bacteria as well as the Pichiaceae, Sebacinaceae, and Amanitaceae fungi increased throughout development, and these microorganisms stably resided in the larval gut. Furthermore, the dynamic changes of the functions of gut bacterial communities were inferred, and there was a significant increase in carbohydrate metabolism across the lifespan of larvae in both groups. Spearman correlation analysis showed that Acetobacteraceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Leuconostocaceae displayed a positive correlation with fructose and mannose metabolism, an important pathway of carbohydrate metabolism, highlighting the potential roles of these prevalent microbial communities in host biology.Copyright © 2019 Yao, Ma, Cai, Raza, Bai, Wang, Zhang, Ma and Zhang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654650>Dysfunctional  with reduced capacity to produce butyrate as a basis for allergic diseases.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662862>A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials exploring the role of fecal  transplantation in recurrent  infection.</a></h1><p>Recurrence remains a challenge in  infection (CDI), and in this field fecal  transplantation (FMT) has attracted significant interest.

Typhimurium in an In Vitro Rumen Simulation System.</a></h1><p>Glyphosate (-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) is the most-used herbicide worldwide. Many studies in the past have shown that residues of the herbicide can be found in many cultivated plants, including those used as livestock feed. Sensitivity to glyphosate varies with bacteria, particularly those residing in the intestine, where  is exposed to glyphosate residues. Therefore, less susceptible pathogenic isolates could have a distinct advantage compared to more sensitive commensal isolates, probably leading to dysbiosis. To determine whether the ruminal growth and survival of pathogenic  or  serovar Typhimurium are higher when glyphosate residues are present in the feed, an  fermentation trial with a "Rumen Simulation System" (RUSITEC) and a glyphosate-containing commercial formulation was performed. Colony forming units of  and  ser. Typhimurium decreased steadily in all fermenters, regardless of the herbicide application. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of the studied  and  strains did not change, and antibiotic susceptibility varied only slightly but independent of the glyphosate application. Overall, application of the glyphosate-containing formulation in a worst-case concentration of 10 mg/L neither increased the abundance for the tested  and  strain in the  fermentation system, nor promoted resistance to glyphosate or antibiotics.© 2019, The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661358>Antibiotics can cause weight loss by impairing gut  in mice and the potent benefits of lactobacilli.</a></h1><p>This study assessed whether antibiotics could alter gut  to affect host growth and the possibility of alleviation by lactobacilli.

We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed weight gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However, body fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Our objective was to investigate whether these dysbiotic bacteria act as pathobionts of T. vaginalis infection by altering pathogenic capabilities of the parasite, particularly in regard to adhesion to vaginal substrates and viability of human ectocervical cells. Assays interrogated the performance of T. vaginalis adhesion to biofilm produced by vaginal dysbiotic bacteria and whether these bacteria were capable of altering the ability of the parasite to bind to mucins and cells. The binding activities of T. vaginalis were quantified by flow cytometry. Host cell viability and apoptosis, as affected by T. vaginalis with or without the bacteria, were also measured experimentally. An in vitro biofilm was shown to provide adhesion for T. vaginalis. The binding of parasites to mucins and cells was modulated by the vaginal dysbiotic bacteria. Parasite cytoadhesion was significantly increased by these bacteria. In addition, these bacteria enhanced the pathogenic effects of the parasite to host cells. Together, this study showed that dysbiotic bacteria accompanying T. vaginalis infection in the vagina function as pathobionts as they are capable of enhancing the pathogenic capabilities of this parasite.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of omega-7-enriched Decaisnea insignis seed oil (DISO) on reducing TMAO formation to prevent the L-carnitine-induced hepatic damage in mice. Feeding of mice with 3% L-carnitine in drinking water clearly increased the serum and urinary levels of TMAO (p<0.05 vs Normal), whereas the serum and urinary TMAO formation was sharply reduced by DISO administration (p<0.05). Meanwhile, DISO resulted in strong inhibition against the elevation of hepatic injury markers (AST, ALT and ALP) activities and dyslipidemia (TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C), as well as liver inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and TNF-β) release in L-carnitine-fed mice, respectively (p<0.05).

It is not necessarily more difficult to measure antimicrobial activity the traditional way, but it is, however, more laborious. In the present study, we developed a new method to measure the antimicrobial activity of LA in multiple samples with a microplate reader. A "test complex" (TC) was produced consisting of 100 μL of agar medium with LA in the bottom layer and 300 μL of broth in the top layer in 96-well deep-well microplates. Afterward, analysis of the broth in the top layer showed that the antimicrobial activity was the same as that of the "control complex," (CC) which consisted of 100 μL of agar medium in the bottom layer and 300 μL of broth with LA in the top layer. Furthermore, evaluation of the antimicrobial effect of the TC when using a microplate reader was the same as that with the use of the colony counting method. The colony counting method has confirmed that the antimicrobial activity of LA when bacteria are inoculated into the broth was equivalent between CC and TC, and we validated this by correlating the number of bacteria with absorbance. In addition, the broth itself in TC was transparent enough that the turbidity of broth can be used as an index of the number of bacteria, which enabled the use of a microplate reader for multiple samples.

We sought to develop a three-dimensional gingivae-biofilm interface model using a commercially available gingival epithelium to study the tissue inflammatory response to oral biofilms associated with "health", "gingivitis" and "periodontitis". These biofilms were developed by sequential addition of microorganisms to mimic the formation of supra- and sub-gingival plaque in vivo.

Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) reduces cholesterol via its conversion into bile acids (BAs). During RCT in non-hepatic peripheral tissues, cholesterol is transferred to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and returned to the liver for conversion into BAs predominantly via the rate-limiting enzyme, cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Numerous reports have described that polyphenol induced increases in BA excretion and corresponding reductions in total and LDL cholesterol in animal and in-vitro studies, but the process whereby this occurs has not been extensively reviewed. There are three main mechanisms by which BA excretion can be augmented: (1) increased expression of CYP7A1; (2) reduced expression of intestinal BA transporters; and (3) changes in the gut . Here we summarise the BA metabolic pathways focusing on CYP7A1, how its gene is regulated via transcription factors, diurnal rhythms, and microRNAs. Importantly, we will address the following questions: (1) Can polyphenols enhance BA secretion by modulating the CYP7A1 biosynthetic pathway? (2) Can polyphenols alter the BA pool via changes in the gut ? (3) Which polyphenols are the most promising candidates for future research? We conclude that while in rodents some polyphenols induce CYP7A1 expression predominantly by the LXRα pathway, in human cells, this may occur through FXR, NF-KB, and ERK signalling. Additionally, gut  is important for the de-conjugation and excretion of BAs. Puerarin, resveratrol, and quercetin are promising candidates for further research in this area.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660354>Corrigendum: The Role of Fecal  Transplantation in Reducing Intestinal Colonization With Antibiotic-Resistant Organisms: The Current Landscape and Future Directions.</a></h1><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1093/ofid/ofz288.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1093/ofid/ofz288.].© The Author(s) 2019.

In healthy individuals, gut commensal fungi act synergistically with other members of the  to maintain homeostasis but their role in IBD is less clear.To review the role of gut fungi and their trans-kingdom interactions with bacteria in IBD METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Ovid and Pubmed to select relevant animal and human studies that have reported fungi and IBD.There is an increased total fungal load particularly of Candida and Malassezia species in the faeces and mucosa of Crohn's disease patients, and a lower fungal diversity in the faeces of ulcerative colitis patients. Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein (CARD)-9 polymorphism in Crohn's disease patients favours Malassezia colonisation that worsens gut inflammation. Diet high in carbohydrates increased the total abundance of Candida species, whereas protein-rich diet had the opposite effect. Anti-fungal therapies are mostly used to treat Candida albicans or Histoplasma capsulatum infections in IBD, whereas pilot studies of supplementing fungal probiotics Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Saccharomyces boulardii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 strain showed therapeutic effects in IBD.Gut fungi are altered in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Modulation of the fungal  can be considered as a therapeutic approach for IBD. Future research should focus on understanding how the fungal  interacts with other components of the gut  in association with the pathogenesis and development of IBD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665947> transplant therapy and autism: lessons for the clinic.</a></h1><p>: The purpose of this review is to discuss  Transplant Therapy (MTT), a type of intensive intestinal  transplantation (IMT), for people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and chronic gastrointestinal disorders (constipation and/or diarrhea).: This paper briefly reviews IMT, gastrointestinal symptoms and gastrointestinal bacteria in children with ASD, and results and lessons learned from intensive MTT for autism.: An open-label study and a two-year follow-up suggests that MTT is relatively safe and effective in significantly reducing gastrointestinal disorders and autism symptoms, changing the gut microbiome structure, and increasing gut microbial diversity.

The present trial aims to examine effects of the probiotic  on symptoms of allergic rhinitis in patients. Effects of this probiotic on the immune system have been reported by several studies, but the majority of the previous trials were animal studies. In addition, it is well known that symptoms in allergic rhinitis are prone to exhibit high placebo responses. Moreover, recent studies report that even placebos without deception (open-label placebos) are highly effective in reducing symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Our study design combines both new approaches to assess effects on allergic symptoms in patients. The objective of this study is to compare the effects of a probiotic treatment () with effects seen by open-label placebo, concealed placebo treatment and no treatment control.A total of 120 patients with allergic rhinitis will be randomly assigned to one of four different groups: a double-blind probiotic/placebo group (groups 1 and 2), an open-label placebo group (group 3) and a no-treatment group (group 4) to control for spontaneous variation of symptoms. The primary outcome is the evaluation of allergic symptoms using the Combined Symptoms Medication Score. Furthermore, health-related quality of life is examined (Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire). Secondary outcomes include a visual analogue scale on allergic burden and a second quality of life questionnaire.

Growing evidence suggests that gut  can interfere with chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant drugs, used in the treatment of these diseases, reducing or facilitating drug efficacy. In particular, the effect of intestinal microflora through translocation, immunomodulation, metabolism, enzymatic degradation and reduction of bacterial diversity seems to be one of the reasons of interindividual variability in the therapeutic response. Although the extent of the role of intestinal microflora in chemotherapy and immunosuppression remains still unresolved, current evidence on bacterial compositional shifts will be taken in consideration together with clinical response to drugs for a better and personalized therapy. This review is focused on the effect of the intestinal  on the efficacy of pharmacological therapy of agents used to treat IBD, JIA and ALL.© 2019 The Authors.

We investigate the potential changes of 5-FU treatment and the modulations of probiotics on gut  in a mouse model.Male BALB/c mice received either 5-FU or saline (S). They were separated and fed saline, Lactobacillus casei variety rhamnosus (Lcr) and Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (BG). Lcr and BG were simultaneously administered with 5-FU for 5 days. Stool specimens were collected for DNA extraction and pyrosequenced for bio-informatic analysis.Fecal microbial communities were obviously diverse. Bacteroides and Bacteroidaceae were the most abundant  in FU.BG group while S24_7 was the most in S. S group. At phylum and class levels, abundances of Betaproteobacteria, Erysipelotrichi, Gammaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia were significantly increased in the FU groups. Probiotics supplementation did increase the abundances of Enterobacteriales and Turicibacterales. We demonstrated probiotics did modulate the abundance and diversity of gut . Bacterial motility proteins were found enriched and upregulated in the S.BG group. No mortality was noted. No bacterial translocation was found in spleen and blood among the 6 groups.Gut  of mice undergoing chemotherapy exhibited a distinct disruption in bacterial composition. Probiotic did modulate the abundance and diversity of gut .

Accumulating studies on the gut-brain axis indicated that the gut  (GM), which participates in various neurological diseases, would provide a harmless therapeutic target for the treatment of CP and epilepsy. To explore the GM characteristics in children with both CP and epilepsy (CPE), we collected fecal samples from 25 CPE patients (CPE group) and 21 healthy children (Healthy group) for 16S rDNA sequencing. In this study, we discovered significantly higher microbial diversity in the CPE group compared to healthy group ( < 0.001). After selecting the top 15 most abundant genera in each group, we found significantly enriched , and  in the CPE group, and noticeably reduced , and .

After KEGG annotation and functional enrichment, 24 functional categories exhibited different enrichment levels between the CPE and Healthy groups. The functions, associated with xenobiotics metabolism, immune system diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases, were enriched in the CPE group. Conversely, the functional categories related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were reduced. Furthermore, the neurodegenerative diseases were mainly attributed to , while an increased risk of immune system diseases was associated with enriched  in the CPE patients.

BZTLF is potentially effective against diabetic vascular complications.Previous studies failed to clarify the molecular mechanism through which BZTLF suppressed diabetic ischemia. In this study, we aimed to explore whether BZTLF treatment could prevent the occurrence of type 2 diabetic (T2D) hindlimb ischemia in mice. Further, we investigated the regulatory effect of BZTLF on angiogenesis-related VEGF signaling pathway and gut  dysfunction in diabetic ischemia mice.C57BL/6J mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) received STZ injection and femoral artery ligation to build T2D diabetic hindlimb ischemia model. Mice were gavaged with BZTLF (5 g [raw materials]/kg/d) or with metformin plus atorvastatin for three weeks. Laser doppler imaging system was utilized for the visualization of blood flow. Histochemistry analysis was performed for microvascular vessel staining. Western blot was applied to detect the protein changes of signaling molecules responsible for VEGF pathway. Finally, 16S rDNA gene sequencing was conducted for analysis of gut  structure.BZTLF treatment remarkably restored blood flow and capillary density of diabetic hindlimb ischemia. And the protein changes of VEGF signaling molecules were reversed in BZTLF-treated diabetic ischemia mice, including the decreased VEGF and HIF-1α, and the increased NO, eNOS and p-ERK1/2. The gut  analysis suggests that BZTLF treatment increased the abundances of several beneficial bacteria (Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides), while decreased the populations of some harmful bacterial (Blautia, Weissella, Escherichia Shigella and Kurthia). By using Spearman correlation analysis, these changed gut flora were positively/negatively correlated with VEGF signaling pathway or glycometabolic parameters.BZTLF displayed beneficial effects on diabetic hindlimb ischemia by reshaping the gut  structure and stunning the VEGF/HIF-1α pathway.Copyright © 2019.

Little is known regarding the changes in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and potential pathogen burden that occur in pediatric recipients of FMT. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in AMR genes, potential pathogens, species, and functional pathways with FMT in children.Nine children with recurrent CDI underwent FMT. Stool was collected from donor and recipient pre-FMT and longitudinally post-FMT for up to 24 weeks. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed. Reads were analyzed using PathoScope 2.0.All children had resolution of CDI. AMR genes decreased post-FMT ( < .001), with a sustained decrease in multidrug resistance genes ( < .001). Tetracycline resistance genes increased post-FMT ( < .001). Very low levels of potential pathogens were identified in donors and recipients, with an overall decrease post-FMT ( < .001).  sp. 109 expanded in all recipients post-FMT, and no recipients had any clinical infection. Alpha diversity was lower in recipients vs donors pre-FMT ( < .001), with an increase post-FMT ( ≤ .002) that was sustained. Beta diversity differed significantly in pre- vs post-FMT recipient samples ( < .001). Bacterial species  and  showed higher abundance in donors than recipients ( = .008 and  = .040, respectively), with expansion post-FMT.

From the biological and botanical perspectives, the interaction between microorganisms and perennial woody plants falls within the category of stable relationships from which the plants can benefit in multiple ways. The life cycle of the host ensures persistence in all seasons, repeated chances of contact, and consequent  accumulation over time, leading to potentially high diversity compared with that of herbaceous short-lived plants. Furthermore, grapevines are agriculturally exploited, highly selected germplasms where a profound man-driven footprint has indirectly and unconsciously shaped the inner  through centuries of cultivation and breeding. Moreover, since endophyte metabolism can contribute to that of the plant host and its fruits' biochemical composition, the nature of grapevine endophytic taxa identities, ecological attitudes, potential toxicity, and clinical relevance are aspects worthy of a thorough investigation. Can endophytic taxa efficiently defend grapevines by acting against pests or confer enough fitness to the plants to endure attacks? What are the underlying mechanisms that translate into this or other advantages in the hosting plant? Can endophytes partially redirect plant metabolism, and to what extent do they act by releasing active products? Is the inner microbial colonization necessary priming for a cascade of actions? Are there defined environmental conditions that can trigger the unleashing of key microbial phenotypes? What is the environmental role in providing the ground biodiversity by which the plant can recruit microsymbionts? How much and by what practices and strategies can these symbioses be managed, applied, and directed to achieve the goal of a better sustainable viticulture?

Beta-glucan or quercetin in a diet can alleviate colorectal cancer (CRC) by regulating the gut  and related genes, but the effects of alternating their consumption for routine ingestion during CRC occurrence remain unknown. This study investigated the effects of alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin for routine ingestion on CRC development in mice. The mortality rate, colonic length, inflammatory cytokines, gut , and colonic epithelial gene expression in healthy and CRC mice that consumed normal and alternate diets were compared and studied. The results showed that alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin (alternating among a β-glucan diet, a normal diet and a normal diet that was supplemented with quercetin) alleviated colon damage and reduced the mortality rate in CRC mice, with a reduction in mortality of 12.5%. Alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin significantly decreased the TNF-α level, increased the relative abundance of  and downregulated three genes ( and ) that are associated with inflammation and cancer.

Therefore we want to investigate whether the dCCA has a certain correlation with biliary microecology, and to detect specific strains.A total of 68 adults were enrolled, of whom 8 with dCCA, 16 with recurrent choledocholithiasis, and 44 with the onset of common bile duct stones. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancretography (ERCP) was utilized to collect bile samples for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, followed by analysis of bile  composition.First, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria are the most dominant phyla in the bile of patients with dCCA and the onset of common bile duct stoes. Secondly, compared with the onset of common bile duct stones patients, we got a significant increase in the phylum Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, Latescibacteria, and Planctomycetes in dCCA patients. Finally, at the genus level, we obtained sequencing results of 252 bacterial genera from patients with dCCA, recurrent choledocholithiasis, and the new onset of common bile duct stones, revealing heterogeneity among individuals.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the dysbiosis of bile flora in patients with dCCA. This micro-ecological disorder may be a decisive factor in the formation of dCCA.

This cross-sectional study examined the relationship between JD scores and fecal  in young Japanese adults, through the analysis of fecal  using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) method. JD scores were calculated with regard to nine food groups (rice, miso soup, pickles, green and yellow vegetables, seaweeds, fish, green tea, meat, and coffee) based on a brief self-administered diet-history questionnaire. JD total scores were categorized as low (score 0-3) or high (score 4-8). The high-scoring JD group exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of Bacteroides than the low JD group, whereas the low JD group exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of Prevotella than the high JD group. With regard to food group intakes, a higher consumption of rice was associated with a significantly lower relative abundance of Prevotella, whereas a higher consumption of green tea was associated with a significantly higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium.

Nutritional constituents strongly influence composition and functional properties of the intestinal microbial communities. Here, we report that omission of a single essential amino acid - tryptophan - from the diet abrogates CNS autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Dietary tryptophan restriction results in impaired encephalitogenic T cell responses and is accompanied by a mild intestinal inflammatory response and a profound phenotypic shift of gut . Protective effects of dietary tryptophan restriction are abrogated in germ-free mice, but are independent of canonical host sensors of intracellular tryptophan metabolites. We conclude that dietary tryptophan restriction alters metabolic properties of gut , which in turn have an impact on encephalitogenic T cell responses.

Lipidomic data were then analyzed using various statistical and bioinformatics tools, which detected numerous lipid species altered by the treatments, and consistently demonstrated interactions between the gut  and the HNaLK diet in altering circulating lipids, mainly triglycerides (TGs). We identified two distinct TG groups, differentially regulated by antibiotic treatment. One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster 2) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster 2 TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster 2 TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, previously associated with reduced diabetes risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

However, their associations with lung cancer risk have not been well investigated.To evaluate the individual and joint associations of dietary fiber and yogurt consumption with lung cancer risk and to assess the potential effect modification of the associations by lifestyle and other dietary factors.This pooled analysis included 10 prospective cohorts involving 1 445 850 adults from studies that were conducted in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Data analyses were performed between November 2017 and February 2019. Using harmonized individual participant data, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for lung cancer risk associated with dietary fiber and yogurt intakes were estimated for each cohort by Cox regression and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Participants who had a history of cancer at enrollment or developed any cancer, died, or were lost to follow-up within 2 years after enrollment were excluded.Dietary fiber intake and yogurt consumption measured by validated instruments.Incident lung cancer, subclassified by histologic type (eg, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma).The analytic sample included 627 988 men, with a mean (SD) age of 57.9 (9.0) years, and 817 862 women, with a mean (SD) age of 54.8 (9.7) years. During a median follow-up of 8.6 years, 18 822 incident lung cancer cases were documented. Both fiber and yogurt intakes were inversely associated with lung cancer risk after adjustment for status and pack-years of smoking and other lung cancer risk factors: hazard ratio, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91) for the highest vs lowest quintile of fiber intake; and hazard ratio, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.87) for high vs no yogurt consumption. The fiber or yogurt associations with lung cancer were significant in never smokers and were consistently observed across sex, race/ethnicity, and tumor histologic type. When considered jointly, high yogurt consumption with the highest quintile of fiber intake showed more than 30% reduced risk of lung cancer than nonyogurt consumption with the lowest quintile of fiber intake (hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.61-0.73] in total study populations; hazard ratio 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54-0.89] in never smokers), suggesting potential synergism.Dietary fiber and yogurt consumption was associated with reduced risk of lung cancer after adjusting for known risk factors and among never smokers.

Further, fruit waxing is a common practice in wholesale cucumber to preserve the water content of fruit and prolong shelf-life, but its impact on epiphytic  is not well studied. This study investigated the survival of Salmonella Newport and S. Javiana on the surface of six cucumber cultivars of varying surface morphology and the effect of fruit waxing on the persistence of S. Newport. S. Newport and S. Javiana were spot inoculated onto fruit of cultivars 'Marketmore 97', 'Patio Snacker' and 'Corinto' (varieties with trichomes or spines), and 'Bella', 'Pepinex' and 'Summer Dance' (glabrous or smooth varieties). Cucumbers were held at room temperature for 24 h before inoculated sections of exocarp were excised for enteropathogen enumeration. S. Javiana persisted at higher populations than S. Newport (1.0 and 1.5 log CFU g exocarp decline, respectively) after 24 h (P < 0.05). Fruit waxing lessened S. Newport population decline after 24 h on all cultivars tested (P < 0.01). While there was a ~2 log CFU g exocarp decline in populations on unwaxed cucumbers, the reduction on waxed cucumbers was ~1 log CFU g exocarp. A cultivar effect was also observed; 'Summer Dance' supported consistently higher and 'Corinto' and 'Marketmore 97' (though for S. Javiana only) consistently lower Salmonella levels. Cultivars with trichomes were associated with lower populations than glabrous cultivars (P < 0.05). Our data showed that Salmonella persistence on fruit differed for the two serotypes tested and that cultivar differences play a role in determining cucumber surface favourability for pathogen colonization. Additionally, fruit waxing may elevate the risk of Salmonella persistence on cucumber.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Dietary fiber is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and modulates the composition of the gut . New evidence indicates that dietary fiber also directly interacts with the epithelium and immune cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract by -independent effects. This review provides a focused overview of how dietary fiber improve human health and how these reported health benefits are connected to molecular pathways, in (1) a -independent manner, via interaction with specific surface receptors on epithelial and immune cells regulating intestinal barrier and immune function, (2) a -dependent manner via maintaining intestinal homeostasis by promoting beneficial microbes, including Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, limiting the growth, adhesion and cytotoxicity of pathogenic microbes, as well as stimulating fiber-derived microbial short-chain fatty acid production.This article is protected by copyright.

Nevertheless, insects' tolerance to Bt is influenced by environmental factors affecting immunity. To understand larval immune response in the devastating coleopteran insect pest Colorado potato beetle (CPB), we undertook a proteomic analysis of hemolymph of non-treated control larvae and larvae consuming non-lethal doses of spore-crystal mixtures containing the coleopteran-active Cry3Aa toxin. Results revealed lower amount of proteins involved in insect growth and higher amount of immune response-related proteins in challenged insects, sustaining the larval weight loss observed. Additionally, we found a potential regulatory role of the evolutionary conserved miR-8 in the insect's immune response relying on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) production. Upon toxin challenge, different patterns of hemolymph AMPs expression and phenoloxidase activity were observed in CPB larvae reared on different Solanaceae plants. This suggests that diet and diet-associated insect midgut  might modulate this insects' tolerance to non-lethal doses of Bt.Copyright © 2019.

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut  contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to metabolic disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or 5 kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related metabolic disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662431>Interrogation of Internal Workings in Microbial Community Assembly: Play a Game through a Behavioral Network?</a></h1><p>Increasing evidence shows that the influence of  on biogeochemical cycling, plant development, and human health is executed through a complex network of microbe-microbe interactions. However, characterizing how microbes interact and work together within closely packed and highly heterogeneous microbial ecosystems is extremely challenging. Here, we describe a rule-of-thumb framework for visualizing polymicrobial interactions and extracting general principles that underlie microbial communities. We integrate elements of metabolic ecology, behavioral ecology, and game theory to quantify the interactive strategies by which microbes at any taxonomic level compete for resources and cooperate symbiotically with each other to form and stabilize ecological communities. We show how the framework can chart an omnidirectional landscape of microbial cooperation and competition that may drive various natural processes. This framework can be implemented into genome-wide association studies to unravel the genetic mechanisms underlying microbial interaction networks and their evolutionary consequences along spatiotemporal gradients. Identifying general biological rules that underlie the complexity and heterogeneity of microbial communities has proven to be highly challenging. We present a rule-of-thumb framework for studying and characterizing how microbes interact with each other across different taxa to determine community behavior and dynamics. This framework is computationally simple but conceptually meaningful, and it can provide a starting point to generate novel biological hypotheses about microbial interactions and explore internal workings of microbial community assembly in depth.Copyright © 2019 Wang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652531>The Role of Glutamine in the Complex Interaction between Gut  and Health: A Narrative Review.</a></h1><p>The scientific literature has demonstrated that glutamine is one of the main beneficial amino acids. It plays an important role in gut  and immunity. This paper provides a critical overview of experimental studies (in vitro, in vivo, and clinical) investigating the efficacy of glutamine and its effect on gut . As a result of this review, we have summarized that glutamine could affect gut  via different mechanisms including the reduction in the ratio of  to  with the activation of NF-κB and PI3K-Akt pathways, reducing the intestinal colonization ( lesions) and bacterial overgrowth or bacterial translocation, increasing the production of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and immunoglobulin A+ (IgA) cells in the intestinal lumen, and decreasing asparagine levels. The potential applications of glutamine on gut  include, but are not limited to, the management of obesity, bacterial translocation and community, cytokines profiles, and the management of side effects during post-chemotherapy and constipation periods. Further studies and reviews are needed regarding the effects of glutamine supplementation on other conditions in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656031>Characterization of the gut  in frail elderly patients.</a></h1><p>The change in the composition of gut  has been reported in the elderly and in the frail individuals; however, studies on gut  in frail elderly are limited.This study aimed to investigate the gut  of the frail elderly.From September 2017 to February 2018, 27 elderly patients hospitalized in the Department of Geriatrics of our hospital were enrolled and divided into the frailty group (n = 15) and the control group (n = 12) based on the cutoff of 0.25 for the frailty index. The fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA-amplicon sequencing to analyze the composition and richness of gut . Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering was performed using Usearch software. Intra-sample diversity (alpha-diversity) analysis and inter-sample diversity (beta-diversity) analyses were performed. The community richness was compared between the two groups at family and genus levels.There were 1903 and 1880 OTUs identified in the control and frailty groups, respectively, with 1282 OTUs overlap between the two groups. The alpha diversity of  community was similar between the two groups, whereas the frailty group had larger beta diversity than the control group. The top-10 taxonomy categories and abundances of gut  between the two groups were similar. As for the gut  composition, 4 families and 17 genera were significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.05).These results suggested that frailty can affect gut  diversity and compositions in late elderly hospitalized patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650468>Baicalein, an enteric microbial metabolite, suppresses gut inflammation and cancer progression in Apc mice.</a></h1><p>Chronic inflammation is recognized as a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Baicalin (BI), a major constituent in an anti-inflammatory herb Scutellaria baicalensis, can be biotransformed into baicalein (BE) by the intestinal . We evaluated the anti-inflammation and anti-CRC effects of the metabolite BE.The in vitro biotransformation by human intestinal  from BI into BE has been determined with HPLC. Using a gut-specific Apc mouse model, the effects of oral BE on the life span, organ index, and tumor multiplicity were evaluated. The expressions of inflammatory cytokines were determined using ELISA. To verify the in vivo data, the anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects of BE were determined with an in vitro cell model.HPLC analysis showed that BI was quickly transformed into BE by the intestinal . Oral BE (30 mg/kg/day) significantly increased the life span, from 125.2 to 218.4 days (P < 0.01%). BE treatment also decreased intestine index and increased spleen index. Compared with the model group, following BE treatment, tumor numbers were significantly reduced in the small intestine and colon (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). In the gut tissues, BE treatment significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine levels such as IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, G-CSF, and GM-CSF. In vitro data supported our in vivo results that the anti-CRC effects of BE were via the inhibition of gut inflammation and induction of cancer cell death.Our results suggest that the parent compound BI can be quickly converted into its microbial metabolite BE, which has stronger bioactive effects than BI. Baicalein is an active chemopreventive metabolite for inflammatory associated CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664519>Dietary intervention using (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a fungus-derived soluble prebiotic ameliorates high-fat diet-induced metabolic distress and alters beneficially the gut  in mice model.</a></h1><p>Western diet, rich in carbohydrates and fat, is said to be a major factor underlying metabolic syndrome. Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut , have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or 5 g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal  analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress. Further comprehensive research has to be conducted to brace its clinical relevance, reproducibility and efficacy for aiding human health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672964>Theabrownin from Pu-erh tea attenuates hypercholesterolemia via modulation of gut  and bile acid metabolism.</a></h1><p>Pu-erh tea displays cholesterol-lowering properties, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut  in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile acids (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic acid, activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654753>Emerging concepts of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease progression: Pathogenic and therapeutic implications.</a></h1><p>Mitochondria are very dynamic organelle which play a multifactorial role for a broad range of physiological processes inside the cell to maintain neural circuit integrity. They are required for the generation of cellular energy, regulation of calcium homeostasis and controlling programmed cell death. Defective mitochondrial homeostasis is frequently reported in a broad range of neurological disorders. Many lines of evidence suggest that it plays an essential role in aging, and neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and its aetiology is still largely unexplored. Overwhelming evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in PD pathogenesis. Various genes involved in maintaining the mitochondrial homeostasis are also associated with the PD pathophysiology. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as generation of reactive oxygen species, impaired mitophagy, altered mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and Ca buffering, may precede the development of PD pathology. In addition, recent studies have also shown the involvement of gut  in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including PD. In this context, mitochondria-targeted therapies that can ameliorate the mitochondrial abnormalities may have great promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review aims to discuss the mitochondrial dysfunction associatedwithPD pathogenesis and various mitochondrial targeted therapies that can improve the mitochondrial function and deplete the severity of disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

However, there are still controversies regarding the mechanisms of the anti-obesity effects of WB. The gut  has recently become a focus of research into obesity-related disorders. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of the gut  to the anti-obesity effects of WB. Germ-free (GF) C57BL/6J mice underwent gastric inoculation with human feces to obtain human flora-associated (HFA) mice, and then both the GF and HFA mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) containing 46% WB or refined barley for 9 weeks. Features of obesity and dyslipidemia were compared between the GF and HFA mice and the cecal  was analyzed using next-generation sequencing of microbial 16S rRNA. WB prevents obesity and hypercholesterolemia in the GF and HFA mice. The mechanism may include the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, because sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA) expression was downregulated, and a reduction in cholesterol accumulation, because cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression was upregulated, independent of the gut . Furthermore, WB intake enriched a variety of bacterial genera that are negatively associated with obesity, including Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Clostridium cluster XIVa, suggesting that WB counteracted gut dysbiosis in obese mice. Thus, WB helps prevent obesity and dyslipidemia via both gut -dependent and independent mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675589>Effects of cadmium on intestinal histology and  in freshwater crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).</a></h1><p>In this study, Procambarus clarkii (P. clarkii) were exposed to different concentrations (0, 2, 5 and 10 mg/L) of cadmium (Cd). We studied the effects of Cd exposure on intestinal histology and  in P. clarkii. The results demonstrated that exposure to Cd caused histological alterations in the intestines of P. clarkii. Meanwhile, high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that Cd exposure could alter the richness, diversity, and composition of intestinal  in P. clarkii. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of the prevalent phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria changed significantly after exposure to Cd. At the genus level, the most prevalent genera with significant difference in relative abundance were Bacteroides, Clostridium XlVb, Hafnia, Buttiauxella, Shewanella, Anaerorhabdus, Alistipes, Arcobacter, Azoarcus, Chryseobacterium, and so on. Furthermore, functional prediction analysis of intestinal microbial communities showed that Cd exposure could significantly alter the pathways related to metabolism, diseases, cellular processes, and so on. Taken together, exposure to Cd could induce intestinal histological damage and affect intestinal  composition and functions of P. clarkii. Our study can be an important step toward a better understanding of the toxic effects of Cd on aquatic crustaceans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to identify potential intestinal microbial pattern in IBS-D patients with SIBO.IBS-D patients fulfilling Rome-III criteria were recruited, and randomly divided into an exploratory cohort (57 cases) and a validation cohort (20 cases). SIBO was identified according to standard glucose hydrogen breath test. For 16S-rRNA gene sequencing, samples of duodenal mucosa, duodenal fluid, rectal mucosa and fresh feces were collected and performed. The α and β diversity, as well as differences in microbial composition and function, in SIBO and SIBO IBS-D subjects were evaluated.The microbial diversity and composition obviously differed between SIBO and SIBO IBS-D in duodenal and rectal mucosa, but not in duodenal fluid and fresh feces. For rectal-mucosal , it displayed markedly reduced aerobe and Gram-negative bacteria, and increased facultative anaerobe and Gram-positive bacteria, moreover, altered functions of microbial metabolism in SIBO IBS-D. Significantly higher rectal mucosa-related MDI was observed in SIBO IBS-D, and a cutoff value at -0.37 had a sensitivity of 56.55% and specificity of 90.91% to identify the SIBO in IBS-D subjects.Mucosal , rather than luminal bacteria, has a more apparent dysbiosis in SIBO IBS-D patients relative to those without SIBO.

Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut  is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

We hypothesized that fecal samples representing the gut  of rainbow trout could be associated with differential growth rates observed in fish breeding programs. If true, harnessing the functionality of this  can improve the profitability of aquaculture. The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis if gut  is associated with fish growth rate (body weight). Four full-sibling families were stocked in the same tank and fed an identical diet. Two fast-growing and two slow-growing fish were selected from each family for 16S rRNA  profiling.  diversity varies with different DNA extraction methods. The second objective of this study was to compare the effects of five commonly used DNA extraction methods on the  profiling and to determine the most appropriate extraction method for this study. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, Phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood/Tissue, and Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters.Differences in DNA extraction methods resulted in significant variation in the identification of bacteria that compose the gut . Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. However, an indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino acid fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus) are indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as indicator taxa for the slow-growing fish.DNA extraction methodology should be carefully considered for accurate profiling of the gut . Although the  was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate. Further studies are warranted to explore how bacteria are transmitted and potential usage of the indicator bacteria of fast-growing fish for development of probiotics that may improve fish health and growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646963>The  structure in the cecum of laying hens contributes to dissimilar HS production.</a></h1><p>Host genotype plays a crucial role in microbial composition of laying hens, which may lead to dissimilar odor gas production. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship among layer breed, microbial structure and odor production.Thirty Hy-Line Gray and thirty Lohmann Pink laying hens were used in this study to determine the impact of cecal microbial structure on odor production of laying hens. The hens were managed under the same husbandry and dietary regimes. Results of in vivo experiments showed a lower hydrogen sulfide (HS) production from Hy-Line hens and a lower concentration of soluble sulfide (S) but a higher concentration of butyrate in the cecal content of the Hy-Line hens compared to Lohmann Pink hens (P < 0.05), which was consistent with the in vitro experiments (P < 0.05). However, ammonia (NH) production was not different between genotypes (P > 0.05). Significant microbial structural differences existed between the two breed groups. The relative abundance of some butyrate producers (including Butyricicoccus, Butyricimonas and Roseburia) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (including Mailhella and Lawsonia) were found to be significantly correlated with odor production and were shown to be different in the 16S rRNA and PCR data between two breed groups. Furthermore, some bacterial metabolism pathways associated with energy extraction and carbohydrate utilization (oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate metabolism, energy metabolism, two component system and secretion system) were overrepresented in the Hy-Line hens, while several amino acid metabolism-associated pathways (amino acid related enzymes, arginine and proline metabolism, and alanine-aspartate and glutamate metabolism) were more prevalent in the Lohmann hens.The results of this study suggest that genotype of laying hens influence cecal , which in turn modulates their odor production.

We analyzed whether vitamin D deficiency alters rat gut . Male Wistar rats were fed a standard or a vitamin D-free diet for seven weeks. The microbiome composition was determined in fecal samples by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The vitamin D-free diet produced mild changes on α- diversity but no effect on β-diversity in the global microbiome. Markers of gut dysbiosis like -to- ratio or the short chain fatty acid producing bacterial genera were not significantly affected by vitamin D deficiency. Notably, there was an increase in the relative abundance of the , with significant rises in its associated genera ,  and  in vitamin D deficient rats.  and  were also increased and  and its genus  were decreased in rats with vitamin D-free diet. In conclusion, vitamin D deficit does not induce gut dysbiosis but produces some specific changes in bacterial taxa, which may play a pathophysiological role in the immunologic dysregulation associated with this hypovitaminosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655880>Amelioration of TMAO through probiotics and its potential role in atherosclerosis.</a></h1><p>Atherosclerosis is a major cause of mortalities and morbidities worldwide.

Disturbance in the human gut  is now considered a critical factor in the atherosclerosis. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) attracts attention and is regarded as a vital contributor in the development of atherosclerosis. TMAO is generated from its dietary precursors choline, carnitine, and phosphatidylcholine by gut  into an intermediate compound known as trimethylamine (TMA), which is then oxidized into TMAO by hepatic flavin monooxygenases.

Emerging data suggest oral microbes may contribute to the onset and severity of this acute side effect.In this study, saliva and oral swabs from head and neck cancer patients undergoing RT were collected. We employed molecular microbiological techniques to study the bacterial communities present in saliva, and both the bacterial and fungal communities present on the buccal mucosa and lateral tongue. Changes in  composition with increasing radiation dose and the presence of mucositis were examined.The data suggest that the salivary  remain stable during RT and are consistently dominated by Streptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium and Granulicatella. Obligate and facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) Bacteroidales G2, Capnocytophaga, Eikenella, Mycoplasma and Sneathia, as well as anaerobic GNB in the periopathogenic genera Porphyromonas and Tannerella, were all positively correlated with ≥ grade 2 OM. Significant increases in the relative abundances of Bacteroidales G2, Fusobacterium and Sneathia were identified in buccal mucosa swabs at sites of ≥ grade 2 OM (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the abundance of several GNB (Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, Tannerella, Porphyromonas and Eikenella) on the buccal mucosa may influence patient susceptibility to developing OM. Candida was widely detected in buccal mucosa swabs, regardless of mucositis status.Our findings support previously hypothesized associations between oral health and the pathogenesis of OM, highlighting the importance of oral health interventions for head and neck cancer patients.</p></html>
