Here we describe one such three-enzyme cascade for the synthesis of 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid. Whole cells of Escherichia coli co-expressing an alcohol dehydrogenase and a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (CHMO) for internal cofactor regeneration were used without the supply of external NADPH or NADP+. The product inhibition caused by the ε-caprolactone formed by the CHMO was overcome by the use of lipase CAL- for in situ conversion into 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid. A stirred tank reactor under fed-batch mode was chosen for efficient catalysis. By using this setup, a product titre of >20 g L-1 was achieved in a 500 mL scale with an isolated yield of 81% 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30392954>Design and optimization of 2,3-dihydrobenzo[][1,4]dioxine propanoic  as novel GPR40 agonists with improved pharmacokinetic and safety profiles.</a></h2><p>GPR40 has become a new potential therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes due to its role in mediating the enhancement of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells with a low risk of hypoglycemia. As an effort to extend the chemical space and identify structurally distinct GPR40 agonists with improved liver safety, a novel series of fused-ring phenyl propanoic acid analogues were designed. Comprehensive structure-activity relationship studies around novel scaffolds were conducted and led to several analogues exhibited potent GPR40 agonistic activities and high selectivity against other  acid receptors. Further evaluation of pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and in vivo efficacy identified compound 40a with excellent PK properties and significant glucose-lowering efficacy during an oral glucose tolerance test. In addition, compound 40a displayed lower hepatobiliary transporter inhibition and favorable druggability. All results indicate that compound 40a is a promising candidate for further development.Copyright © 2018.

However, data on breast milk composition and its relation with growth are sparse.We investigated whether short-chain   (SCFAs), known to be present in HM and linked to energy metabolism, are associated with infancy anthropometrics.In a prospective birth cohort, HM hindmilk samples were collected from 619 lactating mothers at 4-8 wk postnatally [median (IQR) age: 33.9 (31.3-36.5) y, body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2): 22.8 (20.9-25.2)]. Their offspring, born at 40.1 (39.1-41.0) wk gestation with weight 3.56 (3.22-3.87) kg and 51% male, were assessed with measurement of weight, length, and skinfold thickness at ages 3, 12, and 24 mo, and transformed to age- and sex-adjusted z scores. HM SCFAs were measured by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and GC-MS. Multivariable linear regression models were conducted to analyze the relations between NMR HM SCFAs and infancy growth parameters with adjustment for potential confounders.NMR peaks for HM butyrate, acetate, and formic acid, but not propionate, were detected. Butyrate peaks were 17.8% higher in HM from exclusively breastfeeding mothers than mixed-feeding mothers (P = 0.003). HM butyrate peak values were negatively associated with changes in infant weight (standardized   = -0.10, P = 0.019) and BMI ( = -0.10, P = 0.018) between 3 and 12 mo, and negatively associated with BMI ( = -0.10, P = 0.018) and mean skinfold thickness ( = -0.10, P = 0.049) at age 12 mo. HM formic acid peak values showed a consistent negative association with infant BMI at all time points ( < = -0.10, P < = 0.014), whereas HM acetate was negatively associated with skinfold thickness at 3 mo ( = -0.10, P = 0.028) and 24 mo ( = -0.10, P = 0.036).These results suggest that HM SCFAs play a beneficial role in weight gain and adiposity during infancy. Further knowledge of HM  function may inform future strategies to support healthy growth.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278242>Capillary -hydroxybutyrate in Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Authors' Reply.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30479172>Pharmacokinetic drug evaluation of letermovir prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.</a></h2><p>Letermovir is a new antiviral approved to prevent cytomegalovirus infection in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. It has a distinct mechanism of action as it acts as a terminase complex inhibitor, and shows some advantages compared to the current treatment options for cytomegalovirus infection. Areas covered: This review focuses on the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug-drug interactions of letermovir. Expert opinion: Letermovir is a new antiviral to prevent cytomegalovirus infection. Unlike the currently used polymerase inhibitors, it has a distinct mechanism of action with better safety, limited resistance, and no cross-resistance. Although a lot of research on pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions has already been performed, it might be useful to clarify the effect of letermovir on voriconazole exposure, the drug-drug interaction between caspofungine and letermovir and the effect of statins on letermovir exposure.

LY315920 (Varespladib, S-5920, A-001), a low molecular weight drug developed to inhibit several human secreted phospholipases A (PLAs), was recently shown to also inhibit PLAs in whole snake venoms with high potency, yet no studies have examined its direct effect on purified snake venom PLAs. This work evaluated the ability of LY315920 to neutralize the enzymatic and toxic activities of three isolated PLA toxins of structural groups I (pseudexin) and II (crotoxin  and myotoxin I), and their corresponding whole venoms. In vitro, LY315920 inhibited the catalytic activity of these three enzymes upon a synthetic substrate. The drug also blocked their cytotoxic effect on cultured murine myotubes. In mice, preincubation of the toxins or venoms with LY315920, followed by their intramuscular injection, resulted in significant inhibition of muscle damage. Finally, immediate, independent injection of LY315920 at the site of toxin or venom inoculation also resulted in a large reduction of myonecrosis in the case of pseudexin and myotoxin-I, and of Pseudechis colletti and Bothrops asper whole venoms, suggesting a possible method of drug delivery in emergency situations. Present findings add evidence to suggest the possibility of using LY315920 as a field antidote in snakebites, aiming to limit the myonecrosis induced by many venom PLAs in the clinical setting.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In the first stage, calcium acetate (Ca(Ac)) was synthesized in five different ways: (1) acetic acid (HAc) and chicken eggshell (CaAc1), (2) lime (CaAc2), (3) a 1:1 eggshell and lime mixture (CaAc3), (4) a 1:2 eggshell and lime mixture (CaAc4), and (5) calcium oxide via the calcination of eggshell (CaAc5). The synthesized Ca(Ac) samples were characterized by IR, SEM, XRD, and EDS. Subsequently, the samples were used to precipitate oxyanions and organic matter. The experiments were carried out at pH 4 and 12. For the treatment with CaAc1 at pH 4, an acid (HCl, HSO, or HAc) was also added. The best results for CaAc1 in acid media were attained with HCl, where removal efficiencies of 82.23% total suspended solids, 76% turbidity, 81.43% color, 53.86% Fe, 69.74% Cu, and 14.64% Na were observed. This treatment also removed ∼99% fecal and total coliforms, 26.49% COD, and 78.39% TOC. The experiments were also performed at pH 12 using CaAc1. These afforded removal efficiencies of 92.7% turbidity, 84.7% color, 40.5% phosphates (PO), and 64.7% sulfates (SO). In addition, this method removed metals, 35.37% COD and 99% fecal and total coliforms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30616083>Zeaxanthin exerts protective effects on acetic acid-induced colitis in rats via modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis is a common intestinal inflammatory disease characterized by upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Zeaxanthin is a nutritional carotenoid that belongs to the xanthophyll family of pigments. It exerts potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of zeaxanthin on acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rats. Rats were randomly categorized into five groups: control, zeaxanthin, acetic acid, acetic acid + zeaxanthin, and acetic acid + prednisolone groups. Zeaxanthin (50 mg/kg/day) or prednisolone (5 mg/kg/day) was orally administered for 14 days before induction of ulcerative colitis. On the 15th day, colitis was induced by transrectal administration of 3% acetic acid. The rats were sacrificed 24 h after rectal instillation and their colon tissues were examined. Pretreatment with zeaxanthin significantly reduced disease activity index, wet colon weight, ulcer area, macroscopic scores, and histological changes. Zeaxanthin also effectively downregulated the levels of myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde, upregulated the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase, and raised glutathione levels. With regard to anti-inflammatory mechanisms, zeaxanthin suppressed tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta, and nuclear transcription factor kappa  levels, and inhibited nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression. Our results indicate that oral administration of zeaxanthin ameliorates acetic acid-induced colitis in rats via antioxidative effects and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine and mediator activity. Therefore, zeaxanthin may be an effective therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

APCs interact with T cells to link innate and adaptive immune responses. By displaying bacterial and tumorigenic antigens on their surface via major histocompatibility complexes, APCs can directly influence the differentiation of T cells. Likewise, T cell activation, differentiation, and effector functions are modulated by APCs utilizing multiple mechanisms. The objective of this review is to describe how APCs interact with and influence the activation of T cells to maintain innate immunity during exposure to microbial infection and malignant cells. How bacteria and cancer cells take advantage of some of these interactions for their own benefit will also be discussed. While this review will cover a broad range of topics, a general focus will be held around pathogens, cancers, and interactions that typically occur within the gastrointestinal tract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31264939>Impact of solids retention time on the biological performance of an AnMBR treating lipid-rich synthetic dairy wastewater.</a></h2><p>In this study, the impact of applied solids retention time (SRT) on the biological performance of an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) treating synthetic dairy wastewater with high lipid content was assessed. Two side-stream AnMBR systems were operated at an SRT of 20 and 40 days (R20 and R40, respectively), equipped with an inside-out tubular membrane operated in cross-flow mode under full-scale operational conditions, i.e. crossflow velocity, transmembrane pressure, membrane flux. Successful operation was achieved and removal efficiencies of both reactors were up to 99% applying an organic loading rate (OLR) of 4.7 g COD L d. No precipitation of lipids was observed throughout the operational period, keeping the lipids available for the anaerobic degradation. Long chain  acid (LCFA) accumulation was very modest and amounted 148 and 115 mg LCFA-COD per gram of  suspended solids (VSS) for R20 and R40, respectively. At an SRT of 40 days, a slightly better biological conversion was obtained. Periodically performed specific methanogenic activity (SMA) tests showed stabilization of the SMA for R40 sludge, whereas for R20 sludge the SMA continued to decrease. This study revealed a more stable reactor performance operating the AnMBR at an SRT of 40 days compared to 20 days.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30615159>Acequinocyl Resistance Associated With I256V and N321S Mutations in the Two-Spotted Spider Mite (Acari: Tetranychidae).</a></h2><p>The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), is one of the most important pest species, because it devastates many horticultural and ornamental crops and fruit trees. In the present study, we explored a field strain that was collected in January 2001 and then selected for 16 years for acequinocyl resistance. The resistance ratios calculated for the LC50 value in the laboratory-selected acequinocyl-resistant (LSAR16) strain was 4,237-fold higher than that of the susceptible strain. Pretreatment with the synergists piperonyl butoxide and S,S,S-tributyl-phosphorotrithioate significantly increased the toxicity of acequinocyl to the LSAR16 strain. Crossing experiments revealed that the resistance in the LSAR16 strain was maternally inherited, dominant, and monogenic. Furthermore, among individuals in the LSAR16 strain, 85.5-98.5% had the I256V mutation and 98-99% had the N321S mutation in mitochondrial cytochrome . These results suggest that these two new point mutations contribute to acequinocyl resistance in T. urticae.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the causative factors underlying their association remain unknown. Here, using "healthy" aged mice and macaques, we found that IR was induced by activated innate 4-1BBL B1a cells. These cells (also known as 4BL cells) accumulated in aging in response to changes in gut commensals and a decrease in beneficial metabolites such as butyrate. We found evidence suggesting that loss of the commensal bacterium  impaired intestinal integrity, causing leakage of bacterial products such as endotoxin, which activated CCR2 monocytes when butyrate was decreased. Upon infiltration into the omentum, CCR2 monocytes converted B1a cells into 4BL cells, which, in turn, induced IR by expressing 4-1BBL, presumably to trigger 4-1BB receptor signaling as in obesity-induced metabolic disorders. This pathway and IR were reversible, as supplementation with either  or the antibiotic enrofloxacin, which increased the abundance of , restored normal insulin response in aged mice and macaques. In addition, treatment with butyrate or antibodies that depleted CCR2 monocytes or 4BL cells had the same effect on IR. These results underscore the pathological function of B1a cells and suggest that the microbiome-monocyte- cell axis could potentially be targeted to reverse age-associated IR.Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

It is a etrospective, descriptive and multicenter study, based on the collection of data from the clinical records of patients from 0 to 19 years with CH secondary to perinatal infarction in different centers of the community of Catalonia. A total of 310 children were included (55% males and 45% females), from a total of 13 centers in Catalonia. Average age of onset of the crises was 2 ± 1 year. Epilepsy was present in 29.5% (n = 76), among which the most frequent vascular subtype was arterial presumed perinatal ischemic stroke (51.3%), followed by neonatal arterial ischemic stroke (18.4%), periventricular venous infarction (15.8%), neonatal hemorrhagic stroke (10.5%) and neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (3.9%). Semiology of the most frequent seizures was motor focal in 82%, followed by focal motor with secondary bilateralization in 23%, focal discognitive in 13.5%, generalized by 2% and spasms in 6.5%. The 67.3% were controlled with monotherapy and the drugs used were valproate, levetiracetam or carbamazepine. The antecedent of electrical status during sleep was identified in 3 patients, all associated with extensive lesions that included the thalamus. Of the total number of children with epilepsy, 35% began with neonatal seizu res in the first 3 days of life. The 30% of children with perinatal stroke and CH present a risk of epilepsy during childhood.

Fiber-rich common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) promote intestinal health (microbiota and host epithelial barrier integrity) in lean mice. The objective was to assess the intestinal health promoting effects of navy bean supplementation during high-fat (HF)diet-induced obesity. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a high-fat (HF) diet (60% of kcal from fat) or an isocaloric HF diet supplemented with 15.7% (by weight) cooked navy bean powder (HF+) for 12 weeks. Compared to HF, the HF+ diet altered the fecal microbiota community structure (16S rRNA gene sequencing), most notably increasing abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (+19-fold), whose abundance typically decreases in obese humans and rodents. Additionally, HF+ fecal abundance of carbohydrate fermenting, short chain  acid () producing Prevotella (+332-fold) and S24-7 (+1.6-fold) and fecal  levels were increased. HF+ improved intestinal health and epithelial barrier integrity versus HF, evidenced by reduced serum fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran concentration in an in vivo gut permeability test, and increased intestinal mRNA expression of tight junction components (ZO-1, occludin), anti-microbial defenses (Reg3γ, IgA, Defα5, Defβ2) and mucins (Muc2). Additionally, HF+ improved the systemic obese phenotype via reduced serum HOMA-IR and leptin:adiponectin ratio, and locally via attenuation of epididymal adipose tissue crown-like structure formation, adipocyte size, and inflammatory transcription factor (NFκBp65 and STAT3) activation. Therefore, navy bean supplementation improved obese intestinal health (microbiota and epithelial barrier integrity) and attenuated the severity of the obese phenotype.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Perilipin 5 (PLIN5), a lipid droplet coat protein, plays important roles in the development of hepatic steatosis in mice and humans. Whether PLIN5 plays a role in the development of  liver in dairy cows is unknown. An in vivo study consisting of 10 healthy and 10 cows with  liver was performed to harvest liver tissue and blood samples. In addition, hepatocytes isolated from calves were infected with PLIN5 overexpression adenovirus for 48 h; treated with 0, 0.6, 1.2, or 2.4 mM nonesterified   (NEFA) for 24 h; or infected with PLIN5 silencing adenovirus for 48 h and then treated with 1.2 mM NEFA for 24 h. Serum concentrations of NEFA and β-hydroxybutyrate were greater in cows with  liver. Milk production and plasma glucose concentrations were lower in cows with  liver. The results revealed that PLIN5 is highly expressed in steatotic liver and localized to lipid droplets. The abundance of  acid and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis-related proteins including sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c,  acid synthase, acetyl-coA carboxylase 1, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 was greater in the liver of cows with  liver. In contrast, the abundance of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), apolipoprotein B100, and apolipoprotein E was lower in the liver of cows with  liver. Consequently, cows with  liver exhibited severe hepatic TAG accumulation and lower blood concentration of very low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein  (VLDL-ApoB). Overexpression of PLIN5 and exogenous NEFA in cultured hepatocytes increased the abundance of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1,  acid synthase, acetyl-coA carboxylase 1, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 but decreased the abundance of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, apolipoprotein B100, and apolipoprotein E, which promoted TAG synthesis and inhibited VLDL-ApoB assembly, inducing lipid accumulation. Importantly, knockdown of PLIN5 attenuated the upregulation of TAG synthesis and downregulation of VLDL-ApoB assembly induced by NEFA. Overall, these data suggest that NEFA activate PLIN5, leading to TAG accumulation and inhibition of VLDL assembly. As such, these mechanisms explain in part the development of hepatic steatosis in dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, comprehensive study of BBX genes in orchids (Orchidaceae) is not well studied. The newly released genome sequences of Dendrobium officinale and Phalaenopsis equestris have allowed a systematic analysis of these important BBX genes in orchids.Here we identified 19 (DoBBX01-19) and 16 (PeBBX01-16) BBX genes from D. officinale and P. equestris, respectively, and clustered into five clades (I-V) according to phylogenetic analysis. Thirteen orthologous, two DoBBXs paralogous and two PeBBXs paralogous gene pairs were validated. This gene family mainly underwent purifying selection, but five domains experienced positive selection during evolution. Noteworthy, the expression patterns of root, root_tips, stem, leaf, speal, column, lip, and flower_buds revealed that they might contribution to the formation of these tissues. According to the cis-regulatory elements analysis of BBX genes, qRT-PCR experiments were carried out using D. officinale PLBs (protocorm-like bodies) and displayed that these BBX genes were differentially regulated under AgNO, MeJA (Methyl Jasmonate), ABA (abscisic acid) and SA (salicylic acid) treatments.Our analysis exposed that DoBBX genes play significant roles in plant growth and development, and response to different environmental stress conditions of D. officinale, which provide aid in the selection of appropriate candidate genes for further functional characterization of BBX genes in plants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30773142>An uncommon presentation of hyperhomocysteinemia and vitamin  deficiency: a case report.</a></h2><p>Cerebral venous thrombosis is relatively rare and characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical features. It is more common in young adults with women affected more than men. The diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis is easier nowadays due to easy access to advanced neuroimaging techniques. Abnormalities in thrombophilic profile are associated with enhanced risk of cerebral venous thrombosis. It has varied etiologies such as hypercoagulable states, infection, dehydration, pregnancy, and substance abuse. Hyperhomocysteinemia is found to be closely associated with an enhanced risk of cerebral venous thrombosis.Here we report a case of cerebral venous thrombosis secondary to hyperhomocysteinemia caused by vitamin  deficiency in a 32-year-old Indo-Aryan man. A detailed coagulation workup led us to find the etiology of cerebral venous thrombosis in this patient who followed a strict vegetarian diet and had vitamin  deficiency leading to hyperhomocysteinemia.There are conflicting reports in the literature about the association of hyperhomocysteinemia,  deficiency, and cerebral venous thrombosis but some reports point to a significant association.

Films containing 10-50% w/w (DVS/EC) as dry weight were prepared using solvent evaporation method and characterized using texture analyzer, hybrid rheometer, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry, X-ray diffractometry, polarized microscopy, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that there was a decrease in average peak load, melt viscosity, and glass transition temperature (T) while increase in elongation, with increase in concentration of DVS in the films. These results demonstrate the plasticization tendency of DVS on EC, which was attributed to the presence of valproic acid ( acid) in DVS. XRD studies showed amorphous nature of the films; however, polarized microscopy revealed the presence of scattered undissolved sodium valproate crystals. The presence of a single T established complete miscibility between valproic acid and EC. Films showed reasonable physical stability (similar T) at 45 °C/75% RH for 2 weeks (open condition), attributable to the similar solubility parameters of DVS and EC.

The Weibull distribution function was well fitted with the experimental data to analyze release kinetics. The release mechanism parameter was greater than 1.0, which indicates a controlled release with initial induction time. The activation energy for ethyl hexanoate (6 kJ/mol) was lower than d-limonene (41 kJ/mol) at 80% RH, which indicates higher affinition of ethyl hexanoate to migrate from the lipid bilayer membrane towards the water phase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30924229>Effects of rice conservation methods on lactation, blood metabolites, and rumen fermentation in dairy cows.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of rice grain conservation methods on feed intake, milk production, blood metabolites, and rumen fermentation in dairy cows. Raw rice grain was dried before crushing (DRY), ensiled after crushing (ENS-A), or ensiled before crushing (ENS-). Twelve multiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design with three dietary treatments comprising ad libitum access to one of three total mixed rations (TMRs; containing DRY, ENS-A, or ENS- at 17% of dietary dry matter) plus a standard allowance of 2.0 kg/day of dairy concentrates. The dietary treatments did not affect the feed intake, milk yield, or milk composition. The selected blood constituents were not influenced by the rice conservation method. The ruminal lactic acid and total   acid (VFA) concentrations and the VFA proportion in the cows were not influenced by the rice conservation method.

The objective of this work was to investigate the capacity of HMB to suppress activation of nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-ĸ) and production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in a human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line (TE-1).Cell proliferation was measured using the water-soluble tetrazolium-1 method, while tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)-induced IL-6 production was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. Nuclear translocation of NF-ĸ was detected by immunofluorescence staining.HMB did not affect cell proliferation. However, HMB suppressed the TNFα-induced increase in IL-6 production in TE-1 cells by inhibiting NF-ĸ activation.HMB did not influence TE-1 cell proliferation, but inhibited activation of NF-ĸ and IL-6 production. This result may be useful for improving excessive stress reactions during and after surgery.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

The type of production, whether performed by extraction with solvents, or by mechanical techniques, significantly influences the quality of the oil and its potential field of use. Occasionally,  organic substances, which are considered indicative for an oil that has been produced by solvent extraction, are detected in unrefined vegetable oils. This can have a negative impact on high-quality oil mills and their reputation. The goal of the study was to analyse unrefined oils of different raw materials for such compounds. A previously developed and validated method using headspace gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometry was used for this task. Another aim was to determine the origin of any solvent residues in the vegetable oils and to find ways to avoid them. Complementary measurements by solid phase micro extraction gas chromatography were conducted to compare the results of the measurements to an orthogonal methodology.

To address this gap, we designed a two-phase experiment in which we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and monitored the metabolic parameters, gut-brain mediators, and sex hormones of PCOS patients. In the first stage, we identified an imbalance in the intestinal microbiota of the PCOS patients, observing that , , and  were significantly more abundant in the control group, whereas  and  were enriched in the PCOS group. In the second stage, we monitored the impact of the probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis V9 on the intestinal microbiome, gut-brain mediators, and sex hormones of 14 PCOS patients. Notably, we observed that the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and LH/follicle-stimulating hormone (LH/FSH) decreased significantly in 9 volunteers, whereas the levels of sex hormones and intestinal short-chain   (SCFAs) increased markedly. In contrast, the changes in the indices mentioned above were indistinct in the remaining 5 volunteers. The results of an analysis of the number of viable Bifidobacterium lactis V9 cells in the two groups were highly consistent with the clinical and  results. Therefore, effective host gut colonization of the probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis V9 was crucial for its ability to function as a probiotic. Finally, we propose a potential mechanism describing how probiotics regulate the levels of sex hormones by manipulating the intestinal microbiome in PCOS patients.  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common metabolic disorder among women of reproductive age worldwide. Through a two-phase clinical experiment, we first revealed an imbalance in the intestinal microbiome of PCOS patients. By binning and annotating shotgun metagenomic sequences into metagenomic species (MGS), 61 MGSs were identified as potential PCOS-related microbial biomarkers. In the second stage, we monitored the impact of the probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis V9 on the intestinal microbiota, metabolic parameters, gut-brain mediators, and sex hormones of PCOS patients. Notably, we observed that the PCOS-related clinical indices and the intestinal microbiotas of the participating patients exhibited an inconsistent response to the intake of the . lactis V9 probiotic. Therefore, effective host gut colonization of the probiotic was crucial for its ability to function as a probiotic.

Individuals with preleukemic TET2 mutations manifest clonal hematopoiesis and are at a higher risk of developing leukemia. How inflammatory signals influence the survival of preleukemic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is unclear. We show a rapid increase in the frequency and absolute number of Tet2-KO mature myeloid cells and HSPCs in response to inflammatory stress, which results in enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), and resistance to apoptosis. IL-6 induces hyperactivation of the Shp2-Stat3 signaling axis, resulting in increased expression of a novel anti-apoptotic long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs), Morrbid, in Tet2-KO myeloid cells and HSPCs. Expression of activated Shp2 in HSPCs phenocopies Tet2 loss with regard to hyperactivation of Stat3 and Morrbid. In vivo, pharmacologic inhibition of Shp2 or Stat3 or genetic loss of Morrbid in Tet2 mutant mice rescues inflammatory-stress-induced abnormalities in HSPCs and mature myeloid cells, including clonal hematopoiesis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, underlying mechanisms resulting in cellular invasion have been rarely investigated. We used stromal endometrial T-HESC, epithelial endometriotic 12Z, 49Z and Ishikawa cells. Interestingly, proliferation of T-HESC cells was strongly increased after LPA treatment, whereas the epithelial cell lines only showed a moderate increase. LPA increased invasion of 12Z and 49Z strongly and significantly. The LPAR inhibitor Ki16425 (LPAR1/3) attenuated significantly LPA-induced invasiveness of 12Z, which was confirmed by LPAR1 and LPAR3 siRNAs, showing that both LPA receptors contribute to invasiveness of 12Z cells. Investigation of cell invasion with an antibody-based protease array revealed mainly differences in cathepsins and especially cathepsin  between 12Z compared to the less invasive Ishikawa. Stimulation with LPA showed a time- and dose-dependent increased secretion of cathepsin  which was inhibited by the Gq inhibitor YM-254890 and Gi/o inhibitor pertussis toxin in the 12Z cells, again highlighting the importance of LPAR1/3. The activity of intracellular and secreted cathepsin  was significantly upregulated in LPA-treated samples. Inhibition of cathepsin  with the specific inhibitor CA074 significantly reduced LPA-increased invasion of 12Z. Our results reveal a novel role of LPA-mediated secretion of cathepsin  which stimulated invasion of endometriotic epithelial cells mainly via LPAR1 and LPAR3. These findings may deepen our understanding how endometriotic cells invade into ectopic sites, and provide new insights into the role of LPA and cathepsin  in cellular invasion.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

Supplementation with high amylose maize starch (HAMS) might provide clinical benefit by promoting commensal bacteria and the biosynthesis of immunomodulatory metabolites. However, whether the disrupted CF gut microbiota has the capacity to utilise these substrates is not known. We combined metagenomic sequencing,  fermentation, amplicon sequencing, and metabolomics to define the characteristics of the faecal microbiota in adult CF patients and assess HAMS fermentation capacity. Compared to healthy controls, the faecal metagenome of adult CF patients had reduced bacterial diversity and prevalence of commensal fermentative clades.  fermentation models seeded with CF faecal slurries exhibited reduced acetate levels compared to healthy control reactions, but comparable levels of butyrate and propionate. While the commensal genus  was strongly associated with short chain  acid () production by healthy microbiota, it was displaced in this role by  1 in the microbiota of CF patients. A subset of CF reactions exhibited enterococcal overgrowth, resulting in lactate accumulation and reduced  biosynthesis. The addition of healthy microbiota to CF faecal slurries failed to displace predominant CF taxa, or substantially influence metabolite biosynthesis. Despite significant microbiota disruption, the adult CF gut microbiota retains the capacity to exploit HAMS. Our findings highlight the potential for taxa associated with the altered CF gut microbiotato mediate prebiotic effects in microbial systems subject to ongoing perturbation, irrespective of the depletion of common commensal clades.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888539>Glutamate interactions with obesity, insulin resistance, cognition and gut microbiota composition.</a></h2><p>To investigate the interactions among fecal and plasma glutamate levels, insulin resistance cognition and gut microbiota composition in obese and non-obese subjects.Gut microbiota composition (shotgun) and plasma and fecal glutamate, glutamine and acetate (NMR) were analyzed in a pilot study of obese and non-obese subjects (n = 35). Neuropsychological tests [Trail making test A (TMT-A) and Trail making test  (TMT-)] scores measured cognitive information about processing speed, mental flexibility and executive function.Trail-making test score was significantly altered in obese compared with non-obese subjects. Fecal glutamate and glutamate/glutamine ratio tended to be lower among obese subjects while fecal glutamate/acetate ratio was negatively associated with BMI and TMT-A scores. Plasma glutamate/acetate ratio was negatively associated with TMT-. The relative abundance (RA) of some bacterial families influenced glutamate levels, given the positive association of fecal glutamate/glutamine ratio with Corynebacteriaceae, Coriobacteriaceae and Burkholderiaceae RA.

The method was validated in terms of the overall intraday and interday precision, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 0.87-2.87 and 1.47-3.63%, respectively. The recoveries were 98.10-103.60% with an RSD of 1.00-3.40%. The stability of the RSD values was in the range 1.10-3.78%. The developed approach was successfully applied and provides a valuable reference for the quality assessment of PAR and processed PAR.

Twenty-four Holstein cows [130.3 ± 15.4 d in milk, and 30.8 ± 0.543 kg/d of milk yield (mean ± standard error)] were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment to evaluate the following treatments: control diet, without addition of ALG; and increasing levels of ALG [2, 4, and 6 g/kg of dry matter (DM)]. The ALG decreased DM intake and increased total-tract DM apparent digestibility. A tendency was observed for a quadratic effect on total-tract NDF digestibility by ALG inclusion, with peak value of the quadratic response at 4.13 g/kg of DM dose. Moreover, ALG increased ruminal pH and decreased acetate and total   acid concentrations. Fat-corrected milk and energy-corrected milk were quadratically affected, and a tendency for a milk yield effect was observed when ALG levels increased, whereas maximal yields were observed with intermediate doses. Milk fat, protein, and lactose concentrations were diminished, whereas productive efficiency was improved by the increase of ALG levels. Saturated  acid proportions were decreased, whereas polyunsaturated  acid proportions were increased when ALG was fed. There was low DHA transfer into milk; however, ALG inclusion decreased C18:0, C18:1 cis-9, C18:2 cis-9,12, and C18:3 cis-9,12,15 proportions, and increased C18:2 cis-9,trans-11, C18:1 trans-9, and C18:1 trans-11 proportions. Gross energy intake was decreased, whereas no effect was observed on digestible, metabolizable, or net energy intake. The ALG inclusion quadratically affected the microbial protein synthesis, with maximal enhancement at 3.24 g/kg of DM dose, and also increased serum cholesterol concentration. Under the conditions of this experiment, the inclusion of ALG in diets for mid-lactating dairy cows decreased feed intake and increased nutrient digestibility, improving productive efficiency and modifying milk  acid profile. Estimated intermediate doses (1.22 to 2.90 g/kg of DM) of DHA-rich ALG may be beneficial to milk, fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk yields, and is recommended for dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are treatment methods that have been used to successfully degrade organic contaminants in water, soil, sediments and sludge. Reaction rate constants (k) for peroxy acid treatment of 10 substituted naphthalene compounds were determined. The treatment method utilized acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide and a sulphuric acid catalyst to degrade the polyaromatic structures found in the compounds. Molecular structures of the selected compounds were derived at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. Property-encoded surface translator (PEST) descriptors were calculated from B3LYP/6-31G* optimized structures and were found to have significant levels of correlation with k. Models using minimum local ionization potential (PIP.MIN) and a histogram [bin] of the gradient of the K electronic kinetic energy normal to the isosurface (DKN) were evaluated and found to agree within 10% of experimentally derived values of k in most instances. Results show that a combination of PEST descriptors could be used to predict reactivity by the peroxy-acid process.

In the present experiment, we study the function of acetate (a major  in the rabbit gut) on fat metabolism. Ninety rabbits (40 days of age) were randomly divided into three groups: a sham control group (injection of saline for four days); a group experiencing subcutaneous injection of acetate for four days (2 g/kg BM per day, one injection each day, acetate); and a pair-fed sham treatment group.

The disposition mediated by efflux transporters for glucuronide has significant influence on the pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy of bioactive compounds. In the current study, transporter gene knockout mice and Caco-2 cells were used to explore the effects of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) on the disposition of ET-G and 4-ME-G. After oral or i.v. administration of ET and 4-ME, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last data point or infinity values of ET, 4-ME, and their glucuronides (ET-G and 4-ME-G) were remarkably and significantly increased in most Bcrp1 and Mrp2 mice compared with those in wild-type FVB mice ( < 0.05). These results were accompanied with a significant increase of maximum plasma concentration values ( < 0.05). In Caco-2 monolayers, the efflux and clearance rates of ET-G and 4-ME-G were markedly reduced by the BCRP inhibitor Ko143 and MRP2 inhibitor MK571 on the apical side ( < 0.05). In an intestinal perfusion study, the excretion of ET-G was significantly decreased in perfusate and increased in plasma in Bcrp1 mice compared with those in wild-type FVB mice ( < 0.05). The 4-ME-G concentration was also decreased in the bile in transporter gene knockout mice. ET and 4-ME showed good permeability in both Caco-2 monolayers [apparent permeability ( ) ≥ 0.59 × 10 cm/s] and duodenum ( ≥ 1.81).

On day 14, birds from challenged treatments were orally gavaged with ∼5,000 oocysts of Eimeria maxima. On day 19, 20, and 21, the challenged birds received 1 mL of 108 cfu/mL Clostridium perfringens. Total pen body weight (BW) and feed weight were assessed on day 14, 21, and 28 for BW gain and mortality-adjusted feed conversion ratio (FCR). On day 21, 3 birds were randomly selected per pen and scored for intestinal lesions. The duodenum and jejunum tissue were collected on day 21 and 28 for quantifying intestinal histology. Results revealed that adding CMA at 500 ppm showed significantly higher cumulative BW gain (P < 0.05) compared to the challenged control from day 1 to 21. Adding CMA at 500 ppm also showed the equivalent cumulative FCR that was comparable to the non-challenged control on day 21. The CMA treatments and CMP at 1,000 ppm treatment showed equivalent BW gain compared to the non-challenge control after an additional 7 d post-challenge on day 28. Both products at 500 or 1,000 ppm had the significantly (P < 0.05) lower intestinal lesion scores compared to the challenged control. However, there was no difference in lesion scores among the Na- treatments. The Na- product targeted to release in the anterior intestinal tract shows the beneficial effects on BW gain and feed utilization efficiency in current challenge model. Adding encapsulated Na- product has the potential to mitigate the impact of necrotic enteritis in broilers.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30469166>An accurate and reproducible method for simultaneous determination of four flavonoids in EtOAc extracts from Sophora flavescens Ait. in rat plasma based on UHPLC Q-Exactive Mass spectrometry: Application to a pharmacokinetics study.</a></h2><p>In previous studies, it was revealed that ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts from Sophora flavescens Ait. improved glucose tolerance, reduced hyperglycemia, and restored insulin levels in diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to develop an accurate and sensitive UHPLC-MS method for simultaneous determination of flavonoids in EtOAc extracts of Kushen in rat plasma. Ethyl acetate-acetonitrile (2:1) was selected as the solvent to extract the four flavonoids from rat plasma. A BEH C column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm) with a C guard cartridge was chosen as the separation plant using a gradient elution with acetonitrile (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid (solvent ) in water. For all four analytes, the method showed good linearity (r  > 0.991) in 1-500 ng/mL. The inter- and intra-day accuracy ranged from -13.78 to 7.19%, and the precision (RSD) was <8.75%. Recoveries of all four flavonoids ranged from 85.9 to 101.3%. According to the results of multitarget pharmacokinetic studies, four active flavonoids in EtOAc extracts from Kushen have similar absorption kinetics but very different metabolic kinetics, and a double peak phenomenon was observed in the concentration-time curve of norkurarinone, which is different from the previous study. In conclusion, detection and multitarget pharmacokinetic studies successfully determined active flavonoids after oral administration of EtOAc extracts from Kushen by an efficient, sensitive and selective UHPLC-MS method, and the results may provide a foundation for future studies of Kushen.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919752>Commercial formulation amendment transiently affects the microbial composition but not the biogas production of a full scale methanogenic UASB reactor.</a></h2><p>The treatment of dairy wastewater in methanogenic reactors cause several problems due to their high lipid content. One strategy to overcome these problems is the use of commercial formulations. Here we studied the effect of adding a commercial formulation, designed to improve fat degradation, on both the microbial community composition and reactor performance. Samples from two full-scale Up-flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactors in parallel arrangement were analysed. The commercial product was added to one of the reactors while the other was used as control. The amendment increased significantly the fat removal but an accumulation of  was detected. Nevertheless, no significant differences were observed in the total Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal and biogas production between reactors. A significant change in the bacterial community was not detected by 16S rRNA gene Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis probably due to the limitation of the technique. A strong change in the composition of the phylum Firmicutes was detected with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing; however, it didn't persist during the whole operation period. The relative abundance of minor Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with sequences related to syntrophic bacteria increased with the amendment. Although a better hydrolytic capacity was obtained when adding the commercial product, the overall process did not improve and no increase in biogas production was detected. Alternative strategies could be applied to avoid the accumulation of intermediary products and improve biogas production as intermittent addition of the commercial product or batch operation of reactors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30821596>Phenolic compounds and antioxidants from  as affected by some extraction conditions, a preparative optimization for GC-MS analysis.</a></h2><p>Four organic solvents along with water were applied for the conventional extraction of  (Myrtaceae), phenolic contents and antioxidant activities were investigated through variable protocols and correlation coefficients were considered, the phenolic composition was also characterized by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Using solvents with dissimilar polarities affected the phenolic yields extracted from  and their related antioxidant activities varied significantly among the four investigated plant organs. The leaf extract of acetone 70% contained the highest amount of phenolic compounds (46.56 mg/g dry weight); while the bud-water boiled extract maintained the maximum value of tannins (45.68 mg/g dry weight). Correlation coefficients indicated that phenolic compounds were mostly accountable for the phosphomolybednum antioxidant potentials (0.520), followed by tannins (0.460). Also, both the reducing power activities and hydrogen peroxide scavenging of  extracts positively correlated with tannins, but at different significance degrees. However, the GC-MS analysis revealed that most of the detected phenolic constituents were more abundant in the plant seed.

The present study compared the effects of a blanching treatment on the physicochemical properties of water-insoluble fiber enriched fraction (WIFF) from three varieties of vegetable soybean pod hulls (tea vegetable soybean pod hull, TVSPH; black vegetable soybean pod hull, BVSPH; 305 vegetable soybean pod hulls, 305VSPH) and evaluated their effects on intestinal health in hamsters. Blanching may increase the soluble dietary fiber (SDF) content of WIFF in the 305VSPH variety by solubilizing cell wall components and releasing water-soluble sugars. Thus, the WIFF in the 305VSPH variety after blanching may be composed of cellulose and pectic substances. The WIFF of the blanched 305VSPH (-305VSPH) variety exhibited the highest physicochemical properties, such as a water-retention capacity (11.7 g/g), oil-holding capacity (9.34 g/g), swelling property (10.8 mL/g), solubility (12.2%), and cation-exchange capacity (221 meq/kg), of the three varieties examined. The supplementation of -305VSPH WIFF in the diet resulted in significantly ( < 0.05) lower cecal and fecal ammonia; activities of fecal β-d-glucosidase, β-d-glucuronidase, mucinase, and urease; as well as higher cecal total short-chain   relative to other diets. In addition, microbial analysis suggested that fecal bifidobacteria growth was enhanced by the consumption of -305VSPH WIFF. Therefore, -305VSPH WIFF may be applicable as a potential functional ingredient in the food industry for the improvement of intestinal health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30675119>Effects of Queso Blanco Cheese Containing  KACC 91563 on the Intestinal Microbiota and Short Chain  Acid in Healthy Companion Dogs.</a></h2><p>The effects of Queso Blanco cheese containing  KACC 91563 was studied on the intestinal microbiota and short chain   (SCFAs) in healthy companion dogs. There were three experimental groups with five healthy dogs each: a control group, not fed with any cheese, and groups fed with Queso Blanco cheese with (QCB) or without  KACC 91563 (QC) for 8 weeks. Fecal samples were collected 5 times before, during, and after feeding with cheese. Intestinal microbiota was analyzed using two non-selective agar plates (BL and TS) and five selective agar plates (BS, NN, LBS, TATAC, and MacConkey). SPME-GC-MS method was applied to confirm SCFAs and indole in dog feces. The six intestinal metabolites such as acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, isovaleric acid and indole were identified in dog feces. Administration of  KACC 91563 (QCB) for 8 weeks significantly increased the beneficial intestinal bacteria such as  (8.4±0.55) and reduced harmful bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae and  (p<0.05).  such as acetic and propionic acid were significantly higher in the QCB group than in the Control group (p<0.05). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that administration of Queso Blanco cheese containing  KACC 91563 had positive effects on intestinal microbiota and metabolites in companion dogs. These results suggest that Queso Blanco cheese containing  KACC 91563 could be used as a functional food for companion animals and humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899033>Gut microbiota profile in children affected by atopic dermatitis and evaluation of intestinal persistence of a probiotic mixture.</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) has been hypothesised to be associated with gut microbiota (GM) composition. We performed a comparative study of the GM profile of 19 AD children and 18 healthy individuals aimed at identifying bacterial biomarkers associated with the disease. The effect of probiotic intake (Bifidobacterium breve plus Lactobacillus salivarius) on the modulation of GM and the probiotic persistence in the GM were also evaluated. Faecal samples were analysed by real-time PCR and 16S rRNA targeted metagenomics. Although the probiotics, chosen for this study, did not shape the entire GM profile, we observed the ability of these species to pass through the gastrointestinal tract and to persist (only . breve) in the GM. Moreover, the GM of patients compared to CTRLs showed a dysbiotic status characterised by an increase of Faecalibacterium, Oscillospira, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and Sutterella and a reduction of short-chain  acid ()-producing bacteria (i.e., Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Coprococcus, Eubacterium and Propionibacterium).

These were administered orally to 3 groups of monosodium glutamate-obese rats (n = 6), respectively, for 6 weeks. Other groups in the study were the normal (NC), obese control (OC) and standard control (SC) which received orlistat. Hepatic total lipids, total phospholipids, triacylglycerol (TG), total cholesterol (TCHOL), 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase and paraoxonase were studied.Total lipids, TG and TCHOL which increased in OC compared to NC group, were decreased. HMG-CoA reductase activity decreased in the 3 study groups relative to OC. Paraoxonase activity which decreased in OC, was up-regulated, while the magnitude of hepatic cholesterol decreased from 94.32 % in OC to 52.19, 65.43 and 47.04 % with WE, ET and RES, respectively. Flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, tannins and saponins were detected in the nut. GC-MS analysis revealed 16, 18 and 10  components in WE, ET and RES, respectively.

Viral infections and broader gut dysbioses have been identified as potential causes or contributing factors; however, human studies have not yet identified microbial compositional or functional triggers that are predictive of islet autoimmunity or T1D. Here we analyse 10,913 metagenomes in stool samples from 783 mostly white, non-Hispanic children. The samples were collected monthly from three months of age until the clinical end point (islet autoimmunity or T1D) in the The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study, to characterize the natural history of the early gut microbiome in connection to islet autoimmunity, T1D diagnosis, and other common early life events such as antibiotic treatments and probiotics. The microbiomes of control children contained more genes that were related to fermentation and the biosynthesis of short-chain  , but these were not consistently associated with particular taxa across geographically diverse clinical centres, suggesting that microbial factors associated with T1D are taxonomically diffuse but functionally more coherent. When we investigated the broader establishment and development of the infant microbiome, both taxonomic and functional profiles were dynamic and highly individualized, and dominated in the first year of life by one of three largely exclusive Bifidobacterium species (. bifidum, . breve or . longum) or by the phylum Proteobacteria. In particular, the strain-specific carriage of genes for the utilization of human milk oligosaccharide within a subset of . longum was present specifically in breast-fed infants. These analyses of TEDDY gut metagenomes provide, to our knowledge, the largest and most detailed longitudinal functional profile of the developing gut microbiome in relation to islet autoimmunity, T1D and other early childhood events. Together with existing evidence from human cohorts and a T1D mouse model, these data support the protective effects of short-chain   in early-onset human T1D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30630782>Effect of lamotrigine on cognitive function and serum inflammatory factors in patients with depression of recurrent bipolar disorder.</a></h2><p>In the present study, an effort was made to investigate the effect of lamotrigine on cognitive function and serum inflammatory factors in patients with depression of recurrent bipolar disorder and to explore its possible mechanism.140 patients with depression of recurrent bipolar disorder, admitted from June 2015 to April 2017, were selected as the research subjects, followed by random division into the research group and the control group with 70 cases (n=70) in each group. The control group was treated with sodium valproate and the research group was treated with lamotrigine.

Initially, a batch fermentation in vitro study (experiment 1) was performed to investigate the effects of the 3 berry residues on basic ruminal fermentation parameters. Total   acid concentrations, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate, increased in the BC group compared with other treatments. Based on the preliminary in vitro results, 2 consecutive in vivo experiments were conducted using 4 Polish Holstein-Friesian cows fitted with rumen cannulas (experiment 2) and 30 lactating Polish Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (experiment 3) in a replicated 2 × 2 crossover design. Cows in both experiments received a partial mixed ration (PMR) in 2 variants: (1) a control diet of PMR + 2 kg of concentrate (control); (2) PMR + 2 kg of BC seed residues (BC). The BC diet did not mitigate ruminal methane production. Ruminal fermentation (experiment 2) was not affected by the BC diet; however, the concentrations of C18:1 trans-11 and C18:2 cis-9,trans-11 increased significantly by 91 and 131%, respectively. Likewise, concentrations of total trans C18:1 and total monounsaturated FA in ruminal fluid were increased significantly by BC seed residues. In experiment 3, BC significantly increased milk fat C18:1 trans-11, C18:2 cis-9,trans-11, n-3, n-6, and polyunsaturated FA concentrations without affecting milk production performance. In conclusion, the amount (2 kg/d) of BC used in this study did not adversely affect ruminal fermentation or milk production and composition. However, using BC increased proportions of unsaturated FA and conjugated linoleic acid in milk. Although dietary BC did not exert a strong methane inhibition effect, it could represent an inexpensive alternative concentrate to improve beneficial FA in milk without negative effects on rumen fermentation and production parameters in dairy cows. Incorporation of berry seed residues in diets would be profitable economically and nutritionally for dairy cattle production.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Synbiotic, which is a two-point approach carrying probiotic and prebiotic components in mitigating inflammation in IBD, is thought to be a pragmatic approach owing to the synergistic outcomes. In this study, the impacts of dietary supplementation with probiotic  MTCC5856 spores () and prebiotic whole plant sugar cane fibre (PSCF) was assessed using a murine model of IBD. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal chow diet supplemented with either , PSCF or its synbiotic combination. After seven days of supplementation, colitis was induced with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for seven days during the continuation of the supplemented diets. Synbiotic supplementation ameliorated disease activity index and histological score (-72%, 7.38, respectively), more effectively than either  (-47%, 10.1) and PSCF (-53%, 13.0) alone. Synbiotic supplementation also significantly ( < 0.0001) prevented the expression of tight junction proteins and modulated the altered serum IL-1β (-40%), IL-10 (+26%), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (-39%) levels. Synbiotic supplementations also raised the short-chain   () profile more extensively compared to the unsupplemented DSS-control. The synbiotic health outcome effect of the probiotic and prebiotic combinations may be associated with a synergistic direct immune-regulating efficacy of the components, their ability to protect epithelial integrity, stimulation of probiotic spores by the prebiotic fibre, and/or with stimulation of greater levels of fermentation of fibres releasing SCFAs that mediate the reduction in colonic inflammation. Our model findings suggest synbiotic supplementation should be tested in clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474709>Zhengganxifeng Decoction Affects Gut Microbiota and Reduces Blood Pressure via Renin-Angiotensin System.</a></h2><p>Zhengganxifeng decoction (ZGXFD) is a traditional Chinese medicinal formula, from "Medical Zhong parameter West recorded" by Xichun Zhang, which has been applied to the treatment of clinical essential hypertension. Besides its effect in blood pressure reduction, ZGXFD is also known to be a radical therapy with little or no side effects. Compared with western medicines, Chinese medicinal formulas have the advantage of simultaneously attacking multiple targets. However, such a property brings trouble to the pharmacological studies of Chinese medicines. This study investigated the composition of gut microbiota in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with ZGXFD. ZGXFD was shown to cause similar effects in the treatment group as benazepril: both were able to reduce in SHR the microbial diversity, Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/) ratio and coccus to bacillus (C/) ratio. Meanwhile, ZGXFD can maintain the integrity of intestinal mechanistic barrier and elevate the percentage of bacteria producing short chain   (). By investigating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) system, we found that ZGXFD can decrease the expression of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) in lungs, which in turn causes a increase in AngI produces angiotensin1-7 (Ang1-7) and decrease in AngII.

We investigated the persistence of differences in CH emission between groups of cows categorized as either low or high emitters over a 5-mo period. Two feeding regimens (pasture vs. indoors) were used. Early- to mid-lactation Holstein Friesian cows were categorized as low or high emitters (n = 10 each) retrospectively, using predictions from milk mid-infrared (MIR) spectra, before the start of the experiment. Data from MIR estimates and from measurements with the GreenFeed (GF; C-Lock Technology Inc., Rapid City, SD) system over the 5-mo experiment were combined into 7-, 14-, and 28-d periods. Feed intake, eating and ruminating behavior, and ruminal fluid traits were determined in two 7-d measurement periods in the grazing season. The CH emission data were analyzed using a split-plot ANOVA, and the repeatability of each of the applied methods for determining CH emission was calculated. Traits other than CH emission were analyzed for differences between low and high emitters using a linear mixed model. The initial category-dependent differences in daily CH production persisted over the subsequent 5 mo and across 2 feeding regimens with both methods. The repeatability analysis indicated that the biweekly milk control scheme, and even a monthly scheme as practiced on farms, might be sufficient for confirming category differences. However, the relationship between CH data estimated by MIR and measured with GF for individual cows was weak (R = 0.26). The categorization based on CH production also generated differences in CH emission per kilogram of milk; differentiation between cow categories was not persistent based on milk MIR spectra and GF. Compared with the high emitters, low emitters tended to show a lower acetate-to-propionate ratio in ruminal , whereas feed intake and ruminating time did not differ. Interestingly, the low emitters spent less time eating than the high emitters. In conclusion, the CH estimation from analyzing the milk MIR spectra is an appropriate proxy to form and regularly control categories of cows with different CH production levels. The categorization was also sufficient to secure similar and persistent differences in emission intensity when estimated by MIR spectra of the milk. Further studies are needed to determine whether MIR data from individual cows are sufficiently accurate for breeding.The Authors.

Total dependence on parenteral nutrition (PN) is associated with numerous adverse effects, including severe microbial dysbiosis and loss of important butyrate producers. We hypothesised that a lack of butyrate produced by the gut microbiota may be compensated by its supplementation in PN mixtures. We tested whether  butyrate administration would (a) positively modulate intestinal defence mechanisms and () counteract PN-induced dysbiosis. Male Wistar rats were randomised to chow, PN, and PN supplemented with 9 mM butyrate (PN+But) for 12 days. Antimicrobial peptides, mucins, tight junction proteins, and cytokine expression were assessed by RT-qPCR. T-cell subpopulations in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were analysed by flow cytometry. Microbiota composition was assessed in caecum content. Butyrate supplementation resulted in increased expression of tight junction proteins (), antimicrobial peptides (), and lysozyme in the ileal mucosa. Butyrate partially alleviated PN-induced intestinal barrier impairment and normalised IL-4, IL-10, and IgA mRNA expression. PN administration was associated with an increase in Tregs in MLN, which was normalised by butyrate. Butyrate increased the total number of CD4+ and decreased a relative amount of CD8+ memory T cells in MLN. Lack of enteral nutrition and PN administration led to a shift in caecal microbiota composition. Butyrate did not reverse the altered expression of most taxa but did influence the abundance of some potentially beneficial/pathogenic genera, which might contribute to its overall beneficial effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30676853>BST-104, a Water Extract of Lonicera japonica, Has a Gastroprotective Effect via Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Activities.</a></h2><p>The gastroprotective effects of BST-104 (a water extract of Lonicera japonica) and the mechanisms involved were investigated in murine models of gastritis and peptic ulcer. The gastroprotective effects of BST-104 and its active components were evaluated in rat models of HCl/ethanol-induced gastritis and acetic acid-induced gastric ulcer. After orally administering BST-104, chlorogenic acid, rebamipide (positive control), or vehicle to each animal model, gastric lesion sizes, gastric mucus statuses, proinflammatory cytokine levels, and oxidative stress were measured. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and oxidized/reduced glutathione (GSH) ratios in gastric mucosal tissues were measured to evaluate oxidative stress. To clarify the action mechanism of BST-104, we investigated nuclear factor (NF)-κ pathway involvement by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the acetic acid-induced ulcer model, oral administration of BST-104 at 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg significantly reduced gastric lesions by 38%, 43%, and 55%, respectively, compared with vehicle controls. BST-104 significantly increased gastric mucus contents and this was accompanied by higher levels of hexosamine, sialic acid, and prostaglandin E in gastric mucus. Furthermore, BST-104 treatment increased antioxidant activities, as evidenced by higher levels of catalase, SOD, and oxidized/reduced GSH and lower MDA levels. In addition, BST-104 significantly suppressed proinflammatory cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin [IL]-6, and IL-1β) increases, and real-time PCR showed that BST-104 significantly downregulated NF-κ expression. In summary, BST-104 and its active component, chlorogenic acid, were found to have gastroprotective effects by virtue of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties through downregulation of NF-κ expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605698>Alpha-lipoic acid protects against cadmium-induced neuronal injury by inhibiting the endoplasmic reticulum stress eIF2α-ATF4 pathway in rat cortical neurons in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>The heavy metal cadmium (Cd) is well known to be neurotoxic. Studies have shown that apoptosis plays an essential role in Cd-induced brain injury; however, the mechanisms underlying this injury accompanied by apoptosis have yet to be elucidated. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays a key part in the regulation of apoptosis. ER stress is defined as accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER. Here, we demonstrated the role of ER stress on Cd-evoked apoptosis in neuronal cells, as well as the neuroprotective effects of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (α-LA) on Cd-induced ER stress and neuronal injury. In vitro, we observed that Cd activated ER associated proteins via the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway in primary rat cerebral cortical neurons. Furthermore, the ER-stress inhibitor salubrinal blocked the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and significantly reduced the induction of ER stress marker CHOP, the increase of the -cell lymphoma-2 associate X protein (Bax)/-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) ratio, and apoptosis induced by Cd. In addition, Z-ATAD-FMK (a caspase-12 inhibitor) counteracted the Cd-induced activation of caspase-12 and -3, and apoptosis. These in vitro results collectively suggested that ER stress was required for Cd-induced neuronal apoptosis. Importantly, α-LA inhibited the activation of the ER stress eIF2α-ATF4 pathway, the increase of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, the activation of caspase-12 and -3, and the apoptosis induced by Cd. In vivo, we also found that the administration of α-LA alleviated Cd-induced neuronal injury, inhibited the activation of the ER stress eIF2α-ATF4 pathway, restored the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and prevented the activation of caspase-12 and -3. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Cd triggered protein changes in the ER accompanied by apoptosis via the eIF2α-ATF4 signaling pathway in the neuronal cells of rats, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that α-LA protected neurons from Cd-induced injury partly by inhibiting ER stress in rat cerebral cortical neurons.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

Butyrate contributes to gut homeostasis, but it may also control inflammatory responses and host physiology in other tissues. Butyrate inhibits histone deacetylases, thereby affecting gene transcription, and also signals through the metabolite-sensing G protein receptor (GPR)109a. We produced an mAb to mouse GPR109a and found high expression on podocytes in the kidney. Wild-type and  mice were induced to develop nephropathy by a single injection of Adriamycin and treated with sodium butyrate or high butyrate-releasing high-amylose maize starch diet. Butyrate improved proteinuria by preserving podocyte at glomerular basement membrane and attenuated glomerulosclerosis and tissue inflammation. This protective phenotype was associated with increased podocyte-related proteins and a normalized pattern of acetylation and methylation at promoter sites of genes essential for podocyte function. We found that GPR109a is expressed by podocytes, and the use of  mice showed that the protective effects of butyrate depended on GPR109a expression. A prebiotic diet that releases high amounts of butyrate also proved highly effective for protection against kidney disease. Butyrate and GPR109a play a role in the pathogenesis of kidney disease and provide one of the important molecular connections between diet, the gut microbiota, and kidney disease.-Felizardo, R. J.

Hence, endeavors to improve the inflammatory pathology by manipulating gut microbiota are ongoing. Daphnetin (DAPH) is a coumarin derivative extracted from  with anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory properties that has been widely used in treating inflammatory disorders. Herein, we showed that DAPH remarkably alleviated experimental colitis by reducing colonic inflammation, improving colonic integrity, and reestablishing immune and metabolic homeostasis in the inflicted intestines. Our analysis showed that DAPH modified the composition of gut microbiota and altered the metabolic profiles in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. In particular, this agent significantly elevated the abundance of short-chain  acid ()-producing gut microbiota, causatively related with the enhanced development of T cells and the reduced proinflammatory T17 cell differentiation. More critically, the protective effect of DAPH was shown to be transmissible among colitic mice through cohousing or fecal microbiota transplantation, further substantiating the importance of -producing gut microbiota in DAPH action. We thus for the first time reveal the potential of DAPH in resetting the gut microbiome and reestablishing immune homeostasis in colitic mice, which may have clinical implications for treating IBD.-Ji, J., Ge, X., Chen, Y., Zhu, ., Wu, Q., Zhang, J., Shan, J., Cheng, H., Shi, L.

Guidelines for laboratory studies stipulate specific densities, sex ratios, and biting rates, whereas those for field studies are governmentally required before a promising repellent can be registered for human use. These protocols stipulate minimum biting rates alone. Relatively little is known, however, about the influence of mosquito density and sex ratio on their biting propensity, either in the field or laboratory. Using Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for cage testing, we studied the influence of mosquito density and sex ratio in laboratory repellency tests of the biopesticide Ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate (IR3535) (20%) against three mosquito species (, , and ). DEET [3-(-acetyl--butyl) aminopropionic acid ethyl ester] (20%) in a laboratory prepared formulation was used as a comparison article. Studies were conducted by trained investigators at the BioAgri Laboratories in Brazil. We found that higher mosquito density generally decreased protection time, but that the influence of sex ratio was more complex. The presence of male mosquitoes increased protection times against  and  perhaps because mate-seeking males interfered with female feeding. Interestingly, by contrast, protection times decreased against  in the presence of males. Such considerations may potentially assist in improving the match between cage and field testing under a broader range of conditions that permit more accurate labeling of repellents for safe and effective use by consumers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30544287>Fermentative Bio-Hydrogen Production of Food Waste in the Presence of Different Concentrations of Salt (Na) and Nitrogen.</a></h2><p>Fermentation of food waste in the presence of different concentrations of salt (Na) and ammonia was conducted to investigate the interrelation of Na and ammonia content in biohydrogen production. Analysis of the experimental results showed that peak hydrogen production differed according to the ammonia and Na concentration. The peak hydrogen production levels achieved were (97.60, 91.94, and 49.31) ml/g COD at (291.41, 768.75, and 1,037.89) mg-N/L of ammonia and (600, 1,000, and 4,000) mg-Na/L of salt concentration, respectively. At peak hydrogen production, the ammonia concentration increased along with increasing salt concentration in the medium. This means that for peak hydrogen production, the C/N ratio decreased with increasing salt content in the medium. The butyrate/acetate (/A) ratio was higher in proportion to the bio-hydrogen production (r-square: 0.71, -value: 0.0006). Different concentrations of Na and ammonia in the medium also produced diverse microbial communities.  sp.,  sp., and  sp. were predominant with high bio-hydrogen production, while  sp. was found with low bio-hydrogen production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810921>Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 possesses a functional polyhydroxyalkanoate anabolic pathway encoded by the pha genes and synthesizes poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) under nitrogen-limiting conditions.</a></h2><p>Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable bioplastics that are synthesized by diverse bacteria. In this study, the synthesis of PHAs by the model aromatic-degrading strain Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 was analyzed. Twelve pha genes including three copies of phaC and five copies of the phasin-coding phaP genes are distributed among the three LB400 replicons. The phaC1ABR gene cluster that encodes the enzymes of the PHA anabolic pathway is located at chromosome 1 of strain LB400. During the growth of strain LB400 on glucose under nitrogen limitation, the expression of the phaC1, phaA, phaP1, phaR, and phaZ genes was induced. Under nitrogen limitation, PHA accumulation in LB400 cells was observed by fluorescence microscopy after Nile Red staining. GC-MS analyses revealed that the PHA accumulated under nitrogen limitation was poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). LB400 cells grown on glucose as the sole carbon source under nitrogen limitation accumulated 40 ± 0.96% PHB of the cell dry weight, whereas no PHA was observed in cells grown in control medium. The functionality of the phaC1 gene from strain LB400 was further studied using heterologous expression in a Pseudomonas putida KT40C1ZC2 mutant strain derived from P. putida KT2440 that is unable to synthesize PHAs. Interestingly, KT40C1ZC2[pVNC1] cells that express the phaC1 gene from strain LB400 were able to synthesize PHB (33.5% dry weight). This study indicates that . xenovorans LB400 possesses a functional PHA synthetic pathway that is encoded by the pha genes and is capable of synthesizing PHB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30443714>Dicoumarol Inhibits Multidrug Resistance Protein 1-Mediated Export Processes in Cultured Primary Rat Astrocytes.</a></h2><p>Dicoumarol is frequently used as inhibitor of the detoxifying enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). In order to test whether dicoumarol may also affect the cellular glutathione (GSH) metabolism, we have exposed cultured primary astrocytes to dicoumarol and investigated potential effects of this compound on the cell viability as well as on the cellular and extracellular contents of GSH and its metabolites. Incubation of astrocytes with dicoumarol in concentrations of up to 100 µM did not acutely compromise cell viability nor was any GSH consumption or GSH oxidation to glutathione disulfide (GSSG) observed. However, unexpectedly dicoumarol inhibited the cellular multidrug resistance protein (Mrp) 1-dependent export of GSH in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with half-maximal effects observed at low micromolar concentrations of dicoumarol. Inhibition of GSH export by dicoumarol was not additive to that observed for the known Mrp1 inhibitor MK571. In addition, dicoumarol inhibited also the Mrp1-mediated export of GSSG during menadione-induced oxidative stress and the export of the GSH-bimane-conjugate (GS-) that had been generated in the cells after exposure to monochlorobimane. Half-maximal inhibition of the export of Mrp1 substrates was observed at dicoumarol concentrations of around 4 µM (GSH and GSSG) and 30 µM (GS-). These data demonstrate that dicoumarol strongly affects the GSH metabolism of viable cultured astrocytes by inhibiting Mrp1-mediated export processes and identifies for the first time Mrp1 as additional cellular target of dicoumarol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763656>Prebiotic reduction of brain histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and olanzapine-mediated weight gain in rats, are acetate independent.</a></h2><p>The intestinal microbiome is emerging as a novel therapeutic target owing to the wide range of potential health benefits that could result by manipulating the microbiota composition through relatively simple interventions. Ingestion of the prebiotic Bimuno™ galacto-oligosaccharide (-GOS) is one such intervention that has been shown to attenuate olanzapine-induced weight gain and improve cognitive flexibility in rats, potentially through mechanisms involving acetate, the major short-chain  acid () that is produced by -GOS fermentation. The present study investigated the individual influences of -GOS and sodium acetate intake on brain histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities, cortical and hippocampal expression of HDAC1-4 and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunits in saline or olanzapine injected female rats. The effect of sodium acetate on olanzapine-induced weight gain was also investigated. Daily ingestion of -GOS for 21 days, reduced HDAC activity and hippocampal HDAC-4, and elevated levels of cortical HDAC-1 and HDAC-3 mRNAs. Sodium acetate supplementation significantly decreased HAT, but not HDAC, activity and increased hippocampal HDAC-3 and HDAC-4 mRNAs. Olanzapine-induced weight gain and fourteen genera of intestinal bacteria, were not influenced by sodium acetate intake. Together these data suggests the effects of -GOS in rats cannot be replicated by acetate ingestion, and that mechanisms beyond the production of this  are likely to underlie the psychotropic and metabolic actions of this prebiotic.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Gut microbiota metabolite short-chain   (SCFAs) have been reported to regulate T-cell differentiation. However, the mechanisms underlying  regulation of T-cell differentiation and function remain to be investigated.CBir1, an immunodominant microbiota antigen, transgenic T cells were treated with butyrate under various T-cell polarization conditions to investigate butyrate regulation of T-cell differentiation and the mechanism involved. Transfer of butyrate-treated CBir T cells into Rag1-/- mice was performed to study the in vivo role of such T cells in inducing colitis.Although butyrate promoted Th1 cell development by promoting IFN-γ and T-bet expression, it inhibited Th17 cell development by suppressing IL-17, Rorα, and Rorγt expression. Interestingly, butyrate upregulated IL-10 production in T cells both under Th1 and Th17 cell conditions. Furthermore, butyrate induced T-cell -lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp1) expression, and deficiency of Blimp1 in T cells impaired the butyrate upregulation of IL-10 production, indicating that butyrate promotes T-cell IL-10 production at least partially through Blimp1. Rag1-/- mice transferred with butyrate-treated T cells demonstrated less severe colitis, compared with transfer of untreated T cells, and administration of anti-IL-10R antibody exacerbated colitis development in Rag-/- mice that had received butyrate-treated T cells. Mechanistically, the effects of butyrate on the development of Th1 cells was through inhibition of histone deacetylase but was independent of GPR43.These data indicate that butyrate controls the capacity of T cells in the induction of colitis by differentially regulating Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation and promoting IL-10 production, providing insights into butyrate as a potential therapeutic for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

In Experiment 1, twenty goats were fed with an isonitrogenous diet, containing 28% Non-Fiber Carbohydrate (MNFC group,  = 10) or 14% NFC (LNFC group,  = 10). In the MNFC group, the ruminal concentration of Short Chain   () increased, and pH declined. Compared with those in the LNFC group, the microbial protein synthesis in rumen and mRNA abundance of urea transporter  (UT-) in rumen epithelium increased in the MNFC group, although serum urea-N (SUN) did not differ significantly between groups. Simultaneously, urinal urea-N excretion was reduced in the MNFC group. Significant correlations were found between rumen  and UT- and between UT- and urinal urea-N excretion. Furthermore, the abundances of  receptor of GPR41 and GPR43 increased in the rumen epithelium of the MNFC group. These results suggest that increases of SUN transported into the rumen and incorporated into microbial protein and decreases of urinal urea-N excretion are related to ruminal . This is supported by data from our previous study in which added  on the mucosal side caused increases of urea transport rate (flux J urea) from the blood to the ruminal lumen side. In Experiment 2, we used 16S rRNA Amplicon Sequencing to analyze the structure of the ruminal microbiota community in relation to . An additional eight goats were assigned into the MNFC ( = 4) and LNFC ( = 4) groups. The dietary ingredients, chemical composition, and feeding regimes were the same as those in Experiment 1. Constrained correspondence analysis (CCA analysis) revealed NFC promoted the expansion of microbiota diversity, particularly of -producing microbes. The function prediction of 19 upregulated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) ortholog groups showed an NFC-induced increase of the types and abundances of genes coding for enzymes catalyzing N and  acid metabolism. Based on our present and previous investigations, our results indicate that, in goats consuming a MNFC diet, the facilitated urea transport in the rumen and improved urea N salvage are triggered by an expansion of ruminal microbiota diversity and are signaled by ruminal . This study thus provides new insights into the microbiota involved in the dietary modulation of urea-N salvage in ruminant animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354816>Prebiotics, Probiotics, and Acetate Supplementation Prevent Hypertension in a Model of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.</a></h2><p>Disruption of the gut microbiota, termed gut dysbiosis, has been described in animal models of hypertension and hypertensive patients. We have shown that gut dysbiosis plays a causal role in the development of hypertension in a rat model of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Functional analysis of the dysbiotic microbiota in OSA demonstrates a loss of short chain  acid-producing bacteria. However, measurements of short chain  acid concentrations and testing of their role in blood pressure regulation are lacking. We hypothesized that reduced short chain   in the gut are responsible for OSA-induced hypertension. OSA significantly increased systolic blood pressure at 7 and 14 days ( P<0.05), an effect that was abolished by the probiotic Clostridium butyricum or the prebiotic Hylon VII. The 16S rRNA analysis identified several short chain  acid-producing bacteria that were significantly increased by Cbutyricum and Hylon treatment. Acetate concentration in the cecum was decreased by 48% after OSA ( P<0.05), an effect that was prevented by Cbutyricum and Hylon. Cbutyricum and Hylon reduced OSA-induced dysbiosis, epithelial goblet cell loss, mucus barrier thinning, and activation of brain microglia ( P<0.05 for each). To examine the role of acetate in OSA-induced hypertension, we chronically infused acetate into the cecum during 2 weeks of sham or OSA. Restoring cecal acetate concentration prevented OSA-induced gut inflammation and hypertension ( P<0.05). These studies identify acetate as a key player in OSA-induced hypertension. We demonstrate that various methods to increase cecal acetate concentrations are protective from the adverse effects of OSA on the microbiota, gut, brain, and blood pressure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586869>Cytotoxic Drugs Activate KSHV Lytic Cycle in Latently Infected PEL Cells by Inducing a Moderate ROS Increase Controlled by HSF1, NRF2 and p62/SQSTM1.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have indicated that cytotoxic treatments may induce or not activate viral lytic cycle activation in cancer cells latently infected by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). To investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for such an effect, we compared two cytotoxic treatments able to induce the viral lytic cycle, named 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) (T) in combination with sodium butyrate () and bortezomib (BZ), with two cytotoxic treatments that did not activate this process, named metformin (MET) and quercetin (Q). Our results indicated that TB and bortezomib increased levels of oxygen reactive species (ROS) while metformin and quercetin reduced them. The finding that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a reactive oxigen species (ROS) scavenger, counteracted K-bZIP expression induced by TB or bortezomib, confirmed that an ROS increase played a role in KSHV lytic cycle activation. Moreover, we found that TB and bortezomib up-regulated p62/Sequestosome1(p62/SQSTM1) protein, while metformin and quercetin down-regulated it. p62/SQSTM1 silencing or the inhibition of NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) or Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), that mediate p62/SQSTM1 transcription, also reduced KSHV lytic antigen expression induced by TB or bortezomib. Interestingly, such combination treatments further increased intracellular ROS and cytotoxicity induced by the single TB or bortezomib treatment, suggesting that NRF2, HSF1 and p62/SQSTM1 keep the ROS level under control, allowing primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells to continue to survive and KSHV to replicate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056002>Maltobionic acid enhances intestinal absorption of calcium and magnesium in rats.</a></h2><p>In Experiment 1, the effects of calcium maltobionate (MBCa) on calcium and magnesium absorption were examined using male rats. Four diets were designed in which 25%, 50%, and 100% of calcium carbonate (CaCO, Control) were substituted with MBCa and were designated as MBCa-25, MBCa-50, and MBCa-100, respectively. The cecal concentration of short-chain   was significantly higher in groups MBCa-50 and MBCa-100; however, pH of cecal contents did not significantly differ among the groups.

PET data is reconstructed with iterative algorithms, such as VUEPointHD ViP (VPHD) and VUEPoint HD Sharp IR (SharpIR), the latter with additional resolution recovery. It is expected that the resolution recovery algorithm should render more accurate maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) and functional tumor volumes (FTV) than the ordinary OSEM. Performing quantitative analysis, choice of volume-of-interest delineation algorithm (SUV threshold) may influence FTV. Optimizing PET acquisition time is justified if image quality and quantitation do not deteriorate. The aim of this study is to identify the optimal reconstruction algorithm, SUV threshold and acquisition time for ACE-PET/CT.ACE-PET/CT data acquired with a General Electric Discovery 690 PET/CT from 16 consecutive high-risk prostate cancer patients was reconstructed with VPHD and SharpIR. Forty pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) and 14 prostate glands were delineated with 42% and estimated threshold. SUVmax, SUVmean, FTV and total lesion uptake were measured. Default acquisition time was four minutes per bed position. In a subset of lesions, acquisition times of one, two and four minutes were evaluated. Structural tumor volumes (STV) of the LNs were measured with CT for correlation with functional volumetric parameters. To validate SUV quantification under different conditions with SharpIR 42%, recovery coefficients (RCs) of SUVmean and FTV were calculated from a phantom with 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG)-filled volumes 0.1-9.2cm3 and signal-to-background (S/) ratios 4.3-15.9.With SharpIR, SUVmax and SUVmean were higher and FTV lower compared with VPHD, regardless of threshold method, in both prostates and LNs. Total lesion uptake determined with both threshold methods was lower with SharpIR compared with VPHD with both threshold methods, except in subgroup analysis of prostate targets where estimated threshold returned higher values. Longer acquisition times returned higher FTV for both threshold methods, regardless of reconstruction algorithm. The FTV difference was most pronounced with one minute's acquisition per bed position, which also produced visually the highest noise. SUV parameters were unaffected by varying acquisition times. FTV with SharpIR 42% showed the best correspondence with STV. SharpIR 42% gave higher RCs of SUVmean and FTV with increasing phantom size and S/-ratio, as expected.Delineation with SharpIR 42% seems to provide the most accurate combined information from SUVmax, SUVmean, FTV and total lesion uptake. Acquisition time may be shortened to two minutes per bed position with preserved image quality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796802>Supplementation with live yeast increases rate and extent of in vitro fermentation of nondigested feed ingredients by fecal microbiota.</a></h2><p>Two studies were conducted to investigate the effect of live yeast (LY) on the in vitro fermentation characteristics of wheat, barley, corn, soybean meal (SBM), canola meal, and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). In Study 1, LY yeast was added directly to in vitro fermentations inoculated with feces from lactating sows, whereas as in study 2, feces collected from lactating sows fed LY as a daily supplement was used. Selected feedstuffs were digested and the residue added to separate replicated (n = 3) fermentation reactions. Study 1 was conducted in two blocks, whereas study 2 was conducted using feces collected after a period of 3 (Exp. 1) or 4 wk (Exp. 2) of LY supplementation. Accumulated gas produced over 72 h was modeled for each substrate and the kinetics parameters compared between LY and control groups. The molar ratio of the  (VFAs) produced in vitro were also compared at 12 and 72 h of incubation. In study 1, in vitro addition of yeast increased (P < 0.001) the rate of gas production (Rmax). However, a yeast × substrate effect (P < 0.05) observed for total gas accumulated (A), time to half asymptote (), and time required to reach maximum rate of fermentation (Tmax) suggested that yeast-mediated increases in extent and rate of fermentation varied by substrate. Greater total gas production was observed only for corn and SBM, associated with greater  and Tmax. Supplementation with LY appeared to increase A and Rmax although with variation between experiments and substrates. In Exp. 1, LY decreased (P < 0.05)  and Tmax. However, a yeast × substrate effect (P < 0.05) was observed for only A (for wheat, barley, corn, and corn DDGS) and Rmax (wheat, barley, corn, and wheat DDGS). In Exp. 2, LY increased (P < 0.0001) A and decreased . However, an interaction (P < 0.05) with substrates was observed for Rmax (except SBM) and Tmax. With exception of the DDGS samples, LY supplementation increased (P < 0.05) VFA production at 12 and 72 h of incubation. Yeast increased (P < 0.05) the molar ratios of acetic acid and branch-chain   at 12 h of incubation; however, this response was more variable by substrate at 72 h. In conclusion, LY supplementation increased the rate and extent of in vitro fermentation of a variety of substrates prepared from common feedstuffs. Greater effects were observed when LY was fed to sows than added directly in vitro, suggesting effects on fermentation were not mediated directly.© The Author(s) 2019.

Our most recent findings suggested that supplementation with microbiota metabolite sodium butyrate (NaB) could ameliorate progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and decrease blood HbA1c in db/db mice. To further investigate the role of butyrate in homeostasis of blood glucose and glycogen metabolism, we carried out the present study. In db/db mice, we found significant hypertrophy and steatosis in hepatic lobules accompanied by reduced glycogen storage, and expression of GPR43 was significantly decreased by 59.38 ± 3.33%; NaB administration significantly increased NaB receptor G-protein coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) level and increased glycogen storage in both mice and HepG2 cells. Glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) on cell membrane were upregulated by NaB. The activation of intracellular signaling Protein kinase  (PKB), also known as AKT, was inhibited while glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) was activated by NaB in both in vivo and in vitro studies.

Effective probiotics use decreased crude protein digestibility, pH, ammonium nitrogen, valerate levels, and urease and uricase activity, but increased urea, purine trione, nitrate nitrogen, total , and acetate levels. The relative abundance of the bacteria responsible for fermenting carbohydrates to produce short   was increased. Under different treatments, the KEGG Orthology (KO) metabolic pathways of NH3 production and utilization were diverse. Hence, the application of probiotics to control NH3 emissions is dependent on the types and combined ratio of the organisms involved.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30676262>Tolerance of a sulfidogenic sludge to trichloroethylene at microcosms level as a basis for a long-term operation of reactors designed for its biodegradation.</a></h2><p>Trichloroethylene (TCE) is known as a toxic organic compound found as a pollutant in water streams around the world. The ultimate goal of the present work was to determine the TCE concentration that would be feasible to biodegrade on a long-term basis by a sulfidogenic sludge while maintaining sulfate reducing activity (SRA). Microcosms were prepared with sulfidogenic sludge obtained from a stabilized sulfidogenic UASB and amended with different TCE concentrations (100-300 µM) and two different proportions of  (VFA) acetate, propionate and butyrate at COD of 2.5:1:1 and 1:1:1, respectively to evaluate the tolerance of the sludge. The overall results suggested that the continuous exposure of the microorganisms to TCE leads to inhibition of SRA; nonetheless, the SRA can be recovered after adequate supplementation of carbon sources and sulfate. The most suitable TCE concentration to operate on a long-term basis while preserving SRA was 26-35 mg L (200-260 µM). A low level of expression of the mRNA of the sulfite reductase subunit alpha (dsrA) gene was obtained in the presence of the TCE and its intermediate products. This gene was associated to SRB belonging to the genera Desulfovibrio, Desulfosalsimonas, Desulfotomaculum, Desulfococcus, Desulfatiglans and Desulfomonas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454583>Exploration of the reduction mechanism of Cr(VI) in anaerobic hydrogen fermenter.</a></h2><p>The bio-reduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) by anaerobic fermentation is considered as a promising, low-cost and environment-friendly way. However, it is unclear for the reduction mechanisms of Cr(VI) in an anaerobic hydrogen fermenter, such as reduction kinetics, related electron donors, migration and transformation, reduction site and key components, and related microorganisms. To clarify these issues, a hydrogen fermenter was designed to reduce Cr(VI) at 55 °C with glucose as initial substrate. Results show that 100 mg/L Cr(VI) can be completely reduced (99.5%) to trivalent chromium (Cr(III) through chemical and biological reactions. Bio-reduction dominates Cr(VI) removal in a first-order exponential decay mode with both glucose and its metabolites () as electron donors. Moreover,  are more suitable as electron donors for Cr(VI) bio-reduction than glucose. Bacilli, Clostridia and Thermotogae in the fermenter dominated the reduction of Cr(VI) by regulating the production and composition of extracellular polymers (EPSs), in which carboxyl and hydroxyl groups play an important role for Cr(VI) reduction by coordination. The results can guide us to regulate the bio-reduction of Cr(VI), and provide reference for the development of bio-reduction technology of Cr(VI).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Aroma is a main quality factor for this kind of fermented dairy products. In this study, aroma compounds were extracted by four different methods. According to the sensory analysis, solvent-assisted flavor evaporation exhibited the most representative and reproducible method of Lben matrices. In general, a total of 24  compounds were found for the first time in Lben, including aldehyde, alcohols, , esters, and ketones. The Lben characteristic aroma was characterized by 15 odour-active compounds using the application of the aroma extract dilution analysis. On the basis of flavor dilution (FD) results, butanoic acid (FD = 1024, ripened cheese), acetoin (FD = 512, buttery-creamy), 2-heptanol (FD = 512, ) and hexanoic acid (FD = 512, cheesy-goat) were the most powerful key odorants in Lben.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30357477>Sequential inoculum of Hanseniaspora guilliermondii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae for winemaking Campanino on an industrial scale.</a></h2><p>In this study, the effect of sequential inoculation with non-Saccharomyces (Hanseniaspora guilliermondii) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast on the distinctive characteristics of the Campanino white wine was investigated. For this purpose, three independent winemaking experiments were carried out on an industrial scale (batches A,  and C). In detail, the first one was carried out using the sequential inoculation technique while the other two, using a S. cerevisiae single-strain starter or no inoculation representing the control batches. Microbiological and chemical parameters and sensorial profiles of the wines were defined. Interestingly, the results showed that when sequential cultures (H. guilliermondii in a sequential mixture with S. cerevisiae) were used, a better wine aroma and quality was observed. More specifically, the wine obtained by sequential inoculation showed lower acetic acid values and enhanced  profiles than the wine from the control batches. Finally, sensorial analysis confirmed that the sequential cultures led to an improvement in wine flavour. Therefore, results suggest that the sequential inoculation using non-Saccharomyces and Saccharomyces yeast represents a biotechnological practice that can improve the quality features of traditional white wine. It has been shown for the first time that on an industrial scale H. guilliermondii could be used in sequential inoculum with S. cerevisiae in making white Campanino wine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30950084>Methacarn preserves mucus integrity and improves visualization of amoebae in gills of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.).</a></h2><p>Two aqueous fixation methods (modified Davidson's solution and modified Davidson's solution with 2% (w/v) Alcian blue) were compared against two non-aqueous fixation methods (methacarn solution and methacarn solution with 2% (w/v) Alcian blue) along with the standard buffered formalin fixation method to (a) improve preservation of the mucous coat on Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., gills and () to examine the interaction between the amoebae and mucus on the gill during an infection with amoebic gill disease. Aqueous fixatives demonstrated excellent cytological preservation but failed to deliver the preservation of the mucus when compared to the non-aqueous-based fixatives; qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis revealed a greater preservation of the gill mucus using the non-aqueous methacarn solution. A combination of this fixation method and an Alcian blue/Periodic acid-Schiff staining was tested in gills of Atlantic salmon infected with amoebic gill disease; lectin labelling was also used to confirm the mucus preservation in the methacarn-fixed tissue. Amoebae were observed closely associated with the mucus demonstrating that the techniques employed for preservation of the mucous coat can indeed avoid the loss of potential mucus-embedded parasites, thus providing a better understanding of the relationship between the mucus and parasite.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717701>Evaluation of the antioxidant effects of different histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) on human lens epithelial cells (HLECs) after UVB exposure.</a></h2><p>To compare the protective effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), trichostatin A (TSA), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and valproic acid (VPA) on human lens epithelial cells(HLECs) following ultraviolet- (UVB) exposure.HLECs were divided into subgroups: four HDACi groups, a control group, a UVB-treated group and a DMSO group (cells treated with DMSO and UVB irradiation). In the HDACi groups, HLECs were cultured with different concentrations of HDACis 12 h prior to UVB irradiation. The protective effects of the HDACis were evaluated by assessing apoptosis rates, cell activity and expression levels of genes associated with apotosis (caspase-3, Bcl-2, BAX, SOD1, FOXO3A and MT2). The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were detected in order to evaluate oxidative stress.The results showed that SAHA (1 μmol/L, 2 μmol/L) and TSA (0.2 μmol/L) had mild protective effects on cell viability. βOHB (4 mmol/L) and TSA (0.2 mol/L) demonstrated protective effects on BCL-2 expression. TSA (0.2 mol/L) showed protective effects on SOD1 expression. TSA (0.2 mol/L) and SAHA (1 μmol/L) suppressed BAX and caspase-3 expression. TSA (0.2 mol/L, 0.8 mol/L) and SAHA (1 μmol/L, 2 μmol/L) suppressed the expression of FOXO3A and MT2. SOD levels were increased after treatment with βOHB (4 mmol/L), SAHA (8 μmol/L) and TSA (0.1 mol/L, 0.2 mol/L). T-AOC levels were increased in UVB-treated HLECs after treatment with SAHA (2 μmol/L). MDA levels decreased in UVB-treated HLECs following treatment with TSA (0.2 mol/L, 0.8 mol/L). ROS levels decreased in UVB-treated HLECs following treatment with βOHB (4 mmol/L), SAHA (1 μmol/L, 2 μmol/L) and TSA (0.2 mol/L). Western blotting results demonstrated that SOD1 levels significantly increased in the βOHB (4 mmol/L), SAHA (1 μmol/L, 2 μmol/L), TSA (0.1 mol/L, 0.2 mol/L) and VPA (5 mmol/L) groups. Only SAHA (1 μmol/L) had an anti-apoptotic effect on UVB-treated HLECs.Our findings indicate that low concentrations of HDACis (1 μmol/L of SAHA) mildly inhibit oxidative stress, thus protecting HLECs from oxidation. These results may suggest that there is a possibility to explore the clinical applications of HDACis for treatment and prevention of cataracts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802715>EtOAc extract of H. attenuatum Choisy inhibits inflammation by suppressing the NF-κ and MAPK pathways and modulating the gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>Hypericum attenuatum Choisy, a traditional Chinese herb, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of diseases associated with inflammation and has been used to treat rheumatic arthritis in China for centuries. However, the underlying mechanism of its anti-inflammatory effect is poorly understood.In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of EtOAc fractions of H. attenuatum Choisy (Ha-EtOAc) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophage inflammation and hypothesized that Ha-EtOAc could attenuate inflammation in the colon.LPS was utilized to induce RAW264.7 cells inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effect of Ha-EtOAc in RAW264.7 cells was evaluated by measuring the inhibition ratio of nitric oxide (NO) production. Murine ulcerative colitis (UC) was induced by treatment with 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The basic indexes of the mice, including body weight, food intake and hematochezia, were recorded during mice experiments.The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Additionally, the influences of Ha-EtOAc on the NF-κ and MAPK signaling pathways were determined by western blot and immunofluorescence assays. In addition, the impact of Ha-EtOAc on gut microbiota of mice with UC was detected by 16S rDNA sequencing.Ha-EtOAc inhibited the LPS-induced production of NO and decreased the release of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment with Ha-EtOAc could suppress the nuclear translocation of p65 and the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38 and JNK. Ha-EtOAc treatment ameliorated murine UC, as reflected by a reduced body weight loss, improved colon shortening, alleviated mucosal damage and decreased releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, Ha-EtOAc could modulate the composition of microbial communities.Our results demonstrated that Ha-EtOAc exhibited anti-inflammatory effects mainly by suppressing the NF-κ and MAPK pathways, and Ha-EtOAc treatment may be a potent therapy for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

TEB-loaded microparticles with the initial loading amounts of the fungicide of 10, 25, and 50% of the polymer mass (TEB 10, TEB 25, and TEB 50%) were prepared using emulsion technique. Encapsulation efficiency of TEB varied from 59 to 86%. As the loading amount was increased, the average diameter of microparticles increased too, from 41.3 to 71.7 µm, while zeta potential was not influenced by TEB loading, varying between -32.6 and -35.7 mV. TEB was gradually released from the microparticles to the model medium, and after 60 d, from 25 to 43% of TEB was released depending on the content of the encapsulated fungicide. The data obtained from in vitro TEB release were fitted to different mathematical models. It was shown that the release profiles of TEB could be best explained by the Zero-order, Higuchi, and Hixson-Crowell models. The antifungal activity of the P3HB/TEB microparticles against phytopathogenic fungi Fusarium moniliforme and Fusarium solani was demonstrated by in vitro tests conducted in Petri dishes.

The study aimed to assess the clinical features and related factors of tremor in PWE with tremor.PWE with tremor and a control group of age- and sex-matched PWE without tremor were enrolled. Detailed demographic and clinical information for each individual was recorded. PWE with tremor were evaluated by The Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) and Tremor Related Activities of Daily Living (TRADL) questionnaire.132 individuals were enrolled, which including sixty-six (36 males) PWE with tremor with mean age of 33 years and epilepsy duration of 12.5 years. Tremor was postural in all, with median duration of four and one year from diagnosis and AED treatment to the onset of tremor respectively. The upper limbs were predominantly affected. VPA had been used in 62 (93.9%) PWE with tremor compared to 31 (47.0%) PWE without tremor (P < 0.001). The total CRST score was significantly associated with epilepsy duration and maximum VPA dosage ( = 0.30, p < 0.001;  = 0.32, p = 0.013). Patients with VPA dosage over 17.05 mg/kg/d might be more vulnerable to develop tremor.PWE with tremor were more frequently treated with VPA, however, tremor was mild in most without any functional impairment. Epilepsy duration and maximum VPA dosage were important factors of tremor severity, suggesting mechanisms underlying tremor in PWE may be an elaborate interplay of AEDs and disease itself.Copyright © 2019 British Epilepsy Association.

Here we show that pentanoate, a physiologically abundant , is a potent regulator of immunometabolism. Pentanoate induces IL-10 production in lymphocytes by reprogramming their metabolic activity towards elevated glucose oxidation. Mechanistically, this reprogramming is mediated by supplying additional pentanoate-originated acetyl-CoA for histone acetyltransferases, and by pentanoate-triggered enhancement of mTOR activity. In experimental mouse models of colitis and multiple sclerosis, pentanoate-induced regulatory  cells mediate protection from autoimmune pathology. Additionally, pentanoate shows a potent histone deacetylase-inhibitory activity in CD4 T cells, thereby reducing their IL-17A production. In germ-free mice mono-colonized with segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), pentanoate inhibits the generation of small-intestinal Th17 cells and ameliorates SFB-promoted inflammation in the central nervous system. Taken together, by enhancing IL-10 production and suppressing Th17 cells, the  pentanoate might be of therapeutic relevance for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30857338>Intestinal Morphometry, Enzymatic and Microbial Activity in Laying Hens Fed Different Levels of a  Larvae Meal and Toxic Elements Content of the Insect Meal and Diets.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effects of feeding a  (HI) larvae meal on the different intestinal traits of hens, and to determine the toxic elements' concentration in the insect meal and diets, 162 hens were randomly allotted to three groups.

The duodenal and jejunal villi height and villi/crypt were higher ( < 0.01) in the SBM than in the HI groups. The ileal villi height was higher ( < 0.05) in the SBM and HI25 groups than the HI50. The HI50 group exhibited a lower duodenal maltase activity. The intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) activity linearly decreased in the duodenum and jejunum as the dietary insect meal inclusion increased. The HI50 group had a higher acetate and butyrate level than the SBM. The levels of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As) in the diets and insect meal were lower than the maximum values established by the EU Commission.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of supplementing broiler diets with xylanase or xylo- oligosaccharide (XOS) on growth performance, the concentration of non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) hydrolysis products in the ileum and concentration of short chain   () in the caeca of broiler chickens.2. In total, 500 male Ross 308 broilers were used in this 29-day (d) study. The treatments were organised into a 2 × 2 plus 1 factorial arrangement consisting of two additives (xylanase or XOS) at two levels (low or high) plus a control treatment with no additives. This gave five treatments with 100 birds in each treatment group. The diets were slightly deficient in protein by 20 g/kg and energy by 1 MJ/kg.3. On d 14 and 28, two birds per pen were euthanised, the caeca content collected and analysed for short chain  acid () concentration. On d 29, six birds per pen were euthanised and ileal digesta were collected and analysed for the concentration of NSP fractions.4. On d 14, caecal acetic acid, iso-butyric acid, iso-valeric acid, n-valeric acid and total  concentrations were significantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) when diets were supplemented with XOS compared with xylanase.5. Ileal concentration of arabinose, galactose and glucuronic acid (GlucA2) were significantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) in the insoluble NSP fraction when diets were supplemented with a high level of xylanase, compared with the control treatment. Ileal concentration of fructose was significantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) in the water soluble NSP when a high level of xylanase or low level of XOS were included in the diet compared with the control.6. It was concluded that xylanase and XOS had similar effects on NSP concentration and  in the caeca, although there was little effect on performance. This observation demonstrated further benefits of xylanase supplementation in wheat-based broiler diets beyond digesta viscosity reduction and the release of extra nutrients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31011411>Retinal alterations in a pre-clinical model of an autism spectrum disorder.</a></h2><p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect around 1.5% of people worldwide. Symptoms start around age 2, when children fail to maintain eye contact and to develop speech and other forms of communication. Disturbances in glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling that lead to synaptic changes and alter the balance between excitation and inhibition in the developing brain are consistently found in ASD. One of the hallmarks of these disorders is hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli; however, little is known about its underlying causes. Since the retina is the part of the CNS that converts light into a neuronal signal, we set out to study how it is affected in adolescent mice prenatally exposed to valproic acid (VPA), a useful tool to study ASD endophenotypes.Pregnant female mice received VPA (600 mg/kg, ) or saline at gestational day 11. Their male adolescent pups (P29-35) were behaviorally tested for anxiety and social interaction. Proteins known to be related with ASD were quantified and visualized in their retinas by immunoassays, and retinal function was assessed by full-field scotopic electroretinograms (ERGs).Early adolescent mice prenatally exposed to VPA displayed impaired social interest and increased anxiety-like behaviors consistent with an ASD phenotype. The expression of GABA, GAD, synapsin-1, and FMRP proteins were reduced in their retinas, while mGluR5 was increased. The a-wave amplitudes of VPA-exposed were smaller than those of CTR animals, whereas the -wave and oscillatory potentials were normal.This study establishes that adolescent male mice of the VPA-induced ASD model have alterations in retinal function and protein expression compatible with those found in several brain areas of other autism models. These results support the view that synaptic disturbances with excitatory/inhibitory imbalance early in life are associated with ASD and point to the retina as a window to understand their subjacent mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30564756>Diet supplementation with an organic -based formulation affects gut microbiota and expression of gut barrier genes in broilers.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to study the effect of diet supplementation with an organic -based formulation (OABF) on luminal- and mucosa-associated bacteria, concentration of  (VFA), microbial glycolytic enzyme activity and expression of mucin 2 (), immunoglobulin A () and tight junction protein, i.e., zonula occludens-1 (), zonula occludens-2 (), claudin-1 (), claudin-5 () and occludin (), genes at the ileal and cecal level. A 2 × 2 factorial design was used having OABF inclusion and avilamycin as main factors. Subsequently, 544 day-old male Cobb broilers were allocated in the following 4 treatments, each with 8 replicates: no additions (CON), 1 g OABF/kg diet (OA), 2.5 mg avilamycin/kg diet (AV) and combination of OA and AV (OAAV). The trial lasted for 42 days. In the ileum, OAAV resulted in lower mucosa-associated total bacteria levels (  = 0.028) compared with AV. In addition, ileal digesta levels of  subgroup were decreased by avilamycin (  = 0.045). Inclusion of OABF stimulated the activity of microbial glycolytic enzymes, whereas avilamycin resulted in lower acetate (  = 0.021) and higher butyrate (  = 0.010) molar ratios. Expression of  and  was down-regulated by both OABF (  = 0.016 and   = 0.003, respectively) and avilamycin (  = 0.016 and   = 0.001, respectively). In addition,  was down-regulated in AV compared with CON (  = 0.012). Furthermore, OABF down-regulated  (  = 0.027), whereas avilamycin down-regulated nuclear factor kappa  subunit 1 () (  = 0.024), toll-like receptor 2 family member  () (  = 0.011) and toll-like receptor 4 () (  = 0.014) expression. In the ceca, OABF inclusion increased digesta levels of  (  = 0.018) and  (  = 0.040) subgroups, while it up-regulated  expression (  = 0.014). Avilamycin (  = 0.044) and interaction (  < 0.001) effects for  expression were noted, with CON having higher  expression compared with AV. In conclusion, new findings regarding OABF inclusion effects on an array of relevant biomarkers for broiler gut ecology have been reported and discussed in parallel with avilamycin effects used as a positive control.

Antioxidant assays (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and reducing power experiments) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide- (t-BHP-) induced BRL-3A oxidative damage experiments were performed in vitro. The  ethyl acetate fraction (HCEA) was determined to have strong antioxidant activity because of its high flavonoid and polyphenol content. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography- (UPLC-) photodiode array (PDA)/mass spectrometry (MS) analysis showed that the main components of the HCEA were flavonoids and caffeic acid derivatives. A total of 17 compounds were identified. HCEA also effectively protected the liver against t-BHP-induced oxidative stress injury and significantly reduced reactive oxygen (ROS) accumulation. Moreover, HCEA significantly reduced levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Further studies have shown that HCEA inhibits t-BHP-induced apoptosis by increasing -cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) activity and decreasing caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity. Moreover, HCEA enhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), as well as the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and increased the antioxidant level of glutathione (GSH) in BRL-3A cells. HCEA increased the antioxidant capacity of cells by increasing the gene expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (), P38, nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (), , glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (), glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (), and heme oxygenase 1 (), which are associated with antioxidant pathways to protect against oxidative stress. In conclusion, HCEA protected BRL-3A cells against t-BHP-induced oxidative stress damage via antioxidant and antiapoptosis pathways.

In this study, we report that depletion of gut bacteria significantly decreased mucosal and systemic Ab responses in mice orally immunized with OVA and CT. Feeding mice short-chain   (SCFAs) promoted Ab responses elicited by CT, and, more importantly, rescued Ab responses in antibiotic-treated mice. In addition, mice deficient in GPR43, a receptor for SCFAs, showed impaired adjuvant activity of CT. Administering CT did not promote  production in the intestines; thus, SCFAs facilitated but did not directly mediate the adjuvant activity of CT. SCFAs promoted  cell Ab production by promoting dendritic cell production of BAFF and ALDH1a2, which induced  cell expression of IFN regulatory factor 4, Blimp1, and XBP1, the plasma  cell differentiation-related genes. Furthermore, when infected with  GPR43 mice exhibited decreased Ab responses and were more susceptible to infection, whereas the administration of SCFAs promoted intestinal Ab responses in wild-type mice. Our study thereby demonstrated a critical role of gut microbiota and their metabolite SCFAs in promoting mucosal adjuvant activity of CT through GPR43.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374412>Valorization of sewage sludge for  production and role of microbiome on acidogenic fermentation.</a></h2><p>This work explored the production of  (VFA) through the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge (SS). The first experiment took place at batch scale to evaluate the combined effect of using a thermal pre-treatment (120 °C, 15 min) and different Substrate/Inoculum ratios (S/I) (1, 2, 4 and 6 g VS substrate/g VS inoculum) on the acidogenic potential of the SS. The results showed that the thermal pre-treatment influenced positively the degree of acidification of the SS at low S/I ratios, reaching maximum of 45%. Afterwards, a continuous lab-scale experiment, was set-up to study two ranges of organic loading rates (OLR): 1300-1600 mg COD L d and 2400-3500 mg COD L d. The highest degree of acidification (22%) was achieved at the lowest OLR. Analysis of the microbial community in the reactor revealed that OTUs most abundant present genes related with amino  and carbohydrates fermentation being crucial for VFA production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The subject of this study is to evaluate the antiproliferation effects on oral cancer cells by Nepenthes plants using ethyl acetate extract of Nepenthes adrianii x clipeata (EANA). Cell viability was detected using MTS assay. Its detailed mechanisms including cell cycle, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage were explored by flow cytometry or western blotting. For 24 hours EANA treatment, five kinds of oral cancer cells (CAL 27, Ca9-22, OECM-1, HSC-3, and SCC9) show IC values of cell viability ranging from 8 to 17 μg/mL but the viability of normal oral cells (HGF-1) remains over 80%. Subsequently, CAL 27 and Ca9-22 cells with high sensitivity to EANA were chosen to investigate the detailed mechanism. EANA displays the time course and concentration effects for inducing apoptosis based on flow cytometry (subG1 and annexin V analyses) and western blotting [cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (c-PARP)]. Oxidative stress and DNA damage were induced by EANA treatments in oral cancer cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, mitochondrial superoxide, and γH2AX. All these changes of EANA treatments in oral cancer cells were reverted by the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine pretreatment. Therefore, EANA induces preferential killing, apoptosis, and DNA damage against oral cancer cells through oxidative stress.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576940>Effects of organic acid alone and in combination with HO and NaCl on Escherichia coli O157:H7: An evaluation of antioxidant retention and overall acceptability in Basil leaves (Ocimum basilicum).</a></h2><p>In this study, the efficacy of household sanitizers application on reduction of Escherichia coli O157:H7, ascorbic acid, total phenolics, DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging and overall acceptability of inoculated fresh basil leaves (Ocimum basilicum), at temperature of 40 °C was investigated. Sanitizers containing lactic acid (LA), acetic acid (AA) and citric acid (CA) were used at concentration of 2%, individually or in combination with HO (1% or 2%), and NaCl (7%). Control a and  were unwashed and washed leaves with distilled, deionized and sterilized water, respectively.

The probiotic products in powder (PP) or liquid (PL) forms were produced from Ruminococcus flavefaciens, through an anaerobic fermentation process. Barki lambs (n = 30; 24.5 ± 0.5 kg body weight) were used in a completely randomized block design and randomly assigned among three experimental groups and fed for 75 days. Lambs were fed an equal amount of concentrate feed mixture with either no probiotic product (control), or with 20 g of PP, or 10 ml of PL per animal/d, with rice straw ad libitum. Both PP and PL treatments resulted in an increase (p < 0.05) in nearly all of the digestibility coefficients, nitrogen utilization, cell wall constituents, total , rumen volume, microbial nitrogen synthesis, gas production and average daily gain compared to the control group. Ruminal ammonia nitrogen, acetic acid and in vitro methane concentrations and protozoa count decreased (p < 0.03) in the treatment groups.

Therefore, radioprotective measures, against both acute and chronic biological effects of radiation, require frequent intake of nontoxic natural products, which have practical oral administration. The goal of this study was to characterize the radioprotective, radiomitigative and radiation-induced bystander effect-inhibiting properties of endogenous metabolites: phenylacetate, ursodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate. Compounds were administered pre- and postirradiation as well as in donor and recipient bystander flasks to analyze whether these might adequately protect against radiation injury as well as facilitate recovery from the exposures. The clonogenic HCT116 p53 wild-type cancer cell line in this study shares characteristics of stem cells, such as high reproductive viability, which is an effective marker to demonstrate compound effectiveness. Clonogenic assays were therefore used to characterize radioprotective, radiomitigative and bystander inhibiting properties of treatment compounds whereby cellular responses to radiation were quantified with macroscopic colony counts to measure cell survival in flasks. The results were statistically significant for phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate when administered preirradiation, conferring radioprotection up to 2 Gy, whereas administration postirradiation and in bystander experiments did not confer radioprotection . These findings suggest that phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate might be effective radioprotectors, although they possess no radiomitigative properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31017520>Spatial distribution of major bacterial species and different  in a two-phase anaerobic biofilm reactor with PVA gel beads as bio-carrier.</a></h2><p>Conventional completely mixed anaerobic treatment systems limit the chances of the different species of bacteria to spatially group together according to their mutual cooperation and as a result, show a lower efficiency and vulnerability towards shock situations. It is interesting to know about the stratification of the different bacterial species participating in the degradation process and the intermediates that they produce. In this study, we established and optimized a two-phase anaerobic packed bed biofilm reactor system (AnPBR) with porous PVA gel beads used as bio-carriers and ran the reactor system in a steady state to observe the VFAs produced along with the microbial diversity of the predominant species at different stages of the reactor system.

In particular, O. streptacantha (OS) produces abundant mucilage and, hence, the characterization of its properties and nutritional value is important. Accordingly, determination of the dietary fiber content of the OS mucilage and the fermentability of its hydrolysis products (oligosaccharides, OLI) is important for developing new uses of the crop as a functional food.The values for insoluble dietary fiber and soluble dietary fiber in the mucilage were 204.6 and 371.6 g kg , respectively. After hydrolysis of OS mucilage with α-amylase, three purified fractions of OLI were evaluated (OLI-A, OLI- and OLI-C). OLI (1% w/v) stimulated the growth of the commercial probiotic strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) in vitro, showing behaviors similar to those of commercial inulin. The production of short chain   (SCFAs) in the fermentation broth was also determined. The final pH of the fermentation broth as well as the identification and concentrations of  depended on the type of OLI and probiotic used.The OS mucilage is an unconventional fiber source and can be used to produce non-digestible OLI as functional compounds.

We used a chronic constriction injury (CCI) model to explore whether VPA prevents neuropathic pain-mediated inflammation and neuronal death. Rats were treated with or without VPA. CCI + VPA rats were intraperitoneally injected with VPA (300 mg/kg/day) from postoperative day (POD) 1 to 14. We measured paw withdrawal latency (PWL) and paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) 1 day before surgery and 1, 3, 7, 14 days after CCI and harvested the sciatic nerves (SN), spinal cord (SC) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) on POD 3, 7, and 14. PWL and PWT were reduced in CCI rats, but increased in CCI + VPA rats on POD 7 and POD 14. VPA lowered CCI-induced inflammatory proteins (pNFκ, iNOS and COX-2), pro-apoptotic proteins (pAKT/AKT and pGSK-3β/GSK-3β), proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) and nuclear pNFκ activation in the SN, DRG and SC in CCI rats. COX-2 and pGSK-3 proteins were decreased by VPA on immunofluorescence analysis.

In Colombia, the incidence and risk factors for ketosis development have not been studied. The objectives of the present study were to determine the incidence of subclinical (SCK) and clinical ketosis (CK) and to determine the risk factors associated with ketosis within the first 6 weeks of lactation in dairy cattle in Colombia. A prospective cohort study was carried out. A convenience sample of 150 lactating dairy cows from ten commercial dairy farms in the Cundi-Boyacencian Andean plateau were tested weekly using a point of care device to measure β-hydroxybutyrate during the first 6 weeks of lactation. Incidence of SCK and CK was calculated. Risk factors were evaluated using a survey for each animal and for each farm. Potential risk factors were evaluated using a X test, Relative Risk was calculated for significant variables by the X test (P ≤ 0.05) and these variables were included in the logistic regression model. Cumulative incidence of SCK was 25.33%, 3.33% for CK, and overall incidence of ketosis was 26%. In the logistic regression model, parity 3 or more, herd size > 150 animals, body condition score ≥ 3, retained placenta, and metritis were determined as risk factors for ketosis. The results of this study confirm previous reports in which a high body condition score, increased parity, herd size, retained placenta, and metritis are associated with an increased risk of ketosis in stabled and grazing cattle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088374>Comparative transcriptome analyses of genes involved in sulforaphane metabolism at different treatment in Chinese kale using full-length transcriptome sequencing.</a></h2><p>Sulforaphane is a natural isothiocyanate available from cruciferous vegetables with multiple characteristics including antioxidant, antitumor and anti-inflammatory effect. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing has been used for long-read de novo assembly of plant genome. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism related to glucosinolates biosynthesis in Chinese kale using combined NGS and SMRT sequencing.SMRT sequencing produced 185,134 unigenes, higher than 129,325 in next-generation sequencing (NGS). NaCl (75 mM), methyl jasmonate (MeJA, 40 μM), selenate (Se, sodium selenite 100 μM), and brassinolide (BR, 1.5 μM) treatment induced 6893, 13,287, 13,659 and 11,041 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Chinese kale seedlings comparing with control. These genes were associated with pathways of glucosinolates biosynthesis, including phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and glucosinolate biosynthesis. We found NaCl decreased sulforaphane and glucosinolates (indolic and aliphatic) contents and downregulated expression of cytochrome P45083b1 (CYP83b1), S-alkyl-thiohydroximatelyase or carbon-sulfur lyase (SUR1) and UDP-glycosyltransferase 74B1 (UGT74b1). MeJA increased sulforaphane and glucosinolates contents and upregulated the expression of CYP83b1, SUR1 and UGT74b1; Se increased sulforaphane; BR increased expression of CYP83b1, SUR1 and UGT74b1, and increased glucosinolates contents. The desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferases ST5a__c were decreased by all treatments.We confirmed that NaCl inhibited the biosynthesis of both indolic and aliphatic glucosinolates, while MeJA and BR increased them. MeJA and BR treatments, conferred the biosynthesis of glucosinolates, and Se and MeJA contributed to sulforaphane in Chinese kale via regulating the expression of CYP83b1, SUR1 and UGT74b1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30829012>Valproic acid withdrawal ameliorates impairments of hippocampal-spatial working memory and neurogenesis.</a></h2><p>Valproic acid (VPA), an agent that is used to treat epileptic seizures, can cause spatial memory impairment in adults and children. This effect is thought to be due to the ability of VPA to inhibit neurogenesis in the hippocampus, which is required for learning. We have previously used an animal model to show that VPA significantly impairs hippocampal-spatial working memory and inhibits neuronal generation in the sub-granular zone of the dentate gyrus. As there are patient reports of improvements in memory after discontinuing VPA treatment, the present study investigated the recovery of both spatial memory and hippocampal neurogenesis at two time points after withdrawal of VPA. Male Wistar rats were given intraperitoneal injections of 0.9% normal saline or VPA (300 mg/kg) twice a day for 10 d. At 1, 30, or 45 d after the drug treatment, the novel object location (NOL) test was used to examine spatial memory; hippocampal cell division was counted using Ki67 immunohistochemistry, and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Notch1 were measured using western immunoblotting. Spatial working memory was impaired 1 and 30 d after the final administration, but was restored to control levels by 45 d. Cell proliferation had increased to control levels at 30 and 45 d. Both markers of neurogenesis (BDNF and Notch1 levels) had returned to control levels at 45 d. These results demonstrate that memory recovery occurs over a period of six weeks after discontinuing VPA treatment and is preceded by a return of hippocampal neurogenesis to control levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553337>Soluble xyloglucan generates bigger bacterial community shifts than pectic polymers during in vitro fecal fermentation.</a></h2><p>Xyloglucans and pectic polymers can be obtained from a variety of plants ubiquitous in the human diet, however, their fermentability in the colon and consequent nutritional benefits are poorly understood. Here, we evaluated metabolite profiles and bacterial shifts during in vitro fecal fermentations of two isolated pectic polymers and a xyloglucan. Depending on their chemical structure, pectic polymers were more acetogenic or propiogenic. Xyloglucan fermentation also resulted in elevated propionate if compared to FOS. Bacteroides plebeius, . uniformis, Parabacteroides distasonis and bacterial groups such as Blautia, Lachnospira, Clostridiales and Lachnospiraceae, presented distinct abundances on each dietary fiber ferment. PCA and heat map analysis showed that major microbiota shifts occurred during xyloglucan fermentation, but not pectin fermentation. These data suggest that uncommon carbohydrate structures (i.e. isolated, soluble xyloglucan) in the diet hold the potential to generate larger shifts in microbiota communities than commonly consumed fibers (i.e. pectins).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, two recyclable gels (sodium alginate/Ca/fiber:  hydrogels; cellulose nanofiber/chitosan: CNFCS aerogels) were successfully fabricated using the facile method. Additionally, the as-prepared adsorbents were investigated using a series of characterizations. The adsorption behavior and anti-interference performance of the synthesized gels were compared by choosing methylene blue (MB) as the model pollutant. The kinetic behavior of the gels towards MB was consistent with the pseudo first-order model, and the  hydrogels reached adsorption equilibrium faster than the CNFCS aerogels. The maximum adsorption capacity of MB on the  hydrogels and CNFCS aerogels was 1335.0 and 164.5 mg g (pH = 7.0, dosage: 0.5 g/L; initial concentration from 15 to 180 mg L), respectively. More specifically, we found that the co-existing anions had different effects on MB adsorption over the gels used for MB removal. Furthermore, for the  hydrogels, co-existing natural organic matter (NOM) at low concentrations enhanced MB adsorption, and then stabilized as the concentration of NOM increased. However, this increasing trend was not observed for MB adsorption on CNFCS aerogels; these gels exhibited a slight decrease at first, and then showed no change. Nevertheless, both the gels exhibited superior regeneration and recycling abilities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Three organic loading rates (OLR) varied from 0.94 to 2.81 g COD/(L d) were applied. The results of batch adsorption tests on GAC and the experimental data from PBBR-GAC operation were used to set up a COD mass balance in order to investigate the effect of adsorption on the COD removal during the three anaerobic treatment steps. Despite the slight accumulation of  (VFAs) during the second and the third steps, between 735 and 1135 mg COD/L (as acetic acid), a stable environment for methanogens was maintained for a period of 104 days. During the three steps, degradation levels were up to 80% of COD and 85% of phenolic compounds. An averaged specific biogas production of 1.77 L/d and a methane (CH) concentration of about 60%, corresponding to a CH yield of 0.31 L CH/g COD, were reached at an OLR of 2.81 g COD/(L d). The results show that the COD mass balance was not closed during the first two steps, while in the third step, it could be around 96%. This finding suggests that the adsorption of organic substances on activated carbon occur just during the two first steps, while at 2.81 g COD/(L d) OLR no adsorption is occurring and the introduced COD becomes completely available for CH production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260263>Impact of Pristine Graphene on Intestinal Microbiota Assessed Using a Bioreactor-Rotary Cell Culture System.</a></h2><p>The increased use of graphene in consumer products such as food contact materials requires a thorough understanding of its effects on the gastrointestinal commensal bacterial population. During the first phase of study, three representative commensal bacterial species (, , and ) were exposed to different concentrations (1, 10, and 100 μg/mL) of pristine graphene for 3, 6, and 24 h in the Bioreactor Rotary Cell Culture System (BRCCS) which allowed a continuous interaction of intestinal microbiota with the pristine graphene without precipitation of test material. The results showed that pristine graphene had dose-dependent effects on the growth of selective bacteria. To study the interaction of graphene with more diverse consortia of intestinal microbiota, fresh fecal samples from laboratory rats were used. Rat fecal slurry (3%) was maintained in an anaerobic environment and treated with different concentrations (1, 10, and 100 μg/mL) of pristine graphene for 3, 6, and 24 h. Counts of viable aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were assessed and fecal slurries were also collected for microbial population shift analysis using quantitative real-time PCR, as well as 16s rRNA sequencing. The results showed a significant two-fold increase in both aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts (expressed as colony forming unit; CFU) during the first 3 h of exposure to all pristine graphene concentrations. However, 24 h of continuous exposure resulted in a 120% decrease in the CFU of aerobic bacteria at the highest concentration and the anaerobic bacteria CFU remained unchanged. Multivariate analysis of the q-PCR data showed that the exposure time, as well as the graphene concentrations, impacted the bacterial population abundance. Community analysis of graphene-treated fecal samples by 16S sequencing revealed significant alteration of 15 taxonomic groups, including 9 species. The increased abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria (, , and ) was correlated with an increase of the short-chain  acid, butyric acid after exposure to graphene. These results clearly indicate that graphene may cause adverse effects on the intestinal microbiome at the doses equal to 100 μg/mL. Further experiments using  intestinal explants (nonanimal model) could reveal the mechanisms by which graphene could perturb the microbe-host intestinal mucosa homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553888>Effect of dietary supplementation with apple cider vinegar and propionic acid on hemolymph chemistry, intestinal microbiota and histological structure of hepatopancreas in white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei.</a></h2><p>This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation of Apple cider vinegar (ACV) and propionic acid (PA) on biochemical parameters of hemolymph, intestinal microbiota and histology of hepatopancreas in white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). Five experimental diets were evaluated in this study including diets supplemented with 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0% of ACV, 0.5% propionic acid, and a control diet with no supplements. Shrimps (initial weight of 10.2 ± 0.04 g) in triplicate groups with the density of 25 shrimps per tank were fed the diets for 60 days. At the end of the feeding trial, shrimps fed with ACV and PA supplemented diets had significantly higher total protein level than those fed the control diet (P < 0.05). The number of Vibrio spp., R-cells (lipid storage cells) of hepatopancreas and cholesterol level in shrimps fed the diets containing ACV and PA were lower compared to the control group (P < 0.05). However, there was no remarkable variations in glucose concentration, -cell number and tubule diameter among the experimental diets (P > 0.05). In addition, shrimps fed the ACV diets had significantly lower total heterotrophic marine bacteria compared to the control or PA groups, and the lowest bacterial number was observed in shrimp fed 4% ACV supplemented diet (P < 0.05). Supplementation of 2 and 4% ACV as well as 0.5% PA in the diet led to a significantly higher calcium concentration than the control treatment (P < 0.05). The lowest triglyceride concentration was observed in the shrimps fed diets containing 2.0 and 4.0% ACV, which resulted in 15 and 20% reduction, respectively (P < 0.05). Overall, the findings indicates that ACV and PA possess antimicrobial activity and demonstrate beneficial effects on health status, so they can be potentially used as feed additive in the feeding of L. vannamei.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 60 perinatal CD-SD rats were divided in a control group (16 animals) and a schizophrenia model group (44 animals). For the schizophrenia model group the rats received phencyclidine (PCP) 10 mg/kg/day by intradermal injection on days 7, 9, and 11 after birth. The model was confirmed by the Morris water test in 40 rats. The control and model rats were divided into 7 groups. The Real Time PCR assay was used to detect the mRNA expression changes of GABA system gene [GABBR1 (GABA  receptor 1)], GAD1 (glutamic acid decarboxylase1), GAD2 (glutamic acid decarboxylase2), Lipase metabolic key enzyme LPL (lipoprotein lipase) gene, glutamate neurotransmitter gene GRIA2 (AMPA subtype glutamate receptors 2), inward rectifier potassium channel members KCNJ4 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 4) and neuropeptide signal gene TAC1 (tachykinin precursor 1,TAC1) in four brain regions: the prefrontal cortex (PC), the amygdala (AM), the caudate-putamen (CPU) and the hippocampus (HIP). The platform arrival time of PMV and PMVC groups was significantly reduced compared to the PM group, the reduction being more significant in the PMV group. In the four brain regions of the epigenetic animal model of schizophrenia, the expression of GABBR1, GAD1, and GAD2 genes increased significantly. Following administration of HDACI VPA, the mRNA expression of this gene in the four brain regions decreased or approached normal levels.

The concentrations of fermentation metabolites are closely related to the microbial activity that occurs in various digestive compartments. The fermentation products may vary qualitatively and quantitatively, especially within the colon. The Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME), an in vitro dynamic and multicompartment model of the human intestinal tract, can be adapted to mimic the piglet gastrointestinal tract. In this context, a quantitative method, based on solid phase microextraction gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS), was developed for the determination of seven short chain  , i.e. acetic, propionic, butyric, isobutyric, valeric, isovaleric and hexanoic , in samples coming from this experimental in vitro gastrointestinal model. The advantage of the SPME-GC-MS technique is that the seven compounds could be determined in a single run, after a simple and rapid sample treatment, without any other extraction than the automatic SPME. The developed method was validated in accordance to the European and US FDA guidelines and showed good specificity/selectivity. In addition, limits of detection and quantification ranged from 8 to 72 mg L and from 16 to 144 mg L, respectively. Two internal quality control samples spiked at different concentrations were analyzed to assess the trueness of the developed method, which ranged between 97.7 and 122.4% of the expected value, for the seven compounds analyzed. The method was successfully applied to twenty samples coming from a gastrointestinal model, with different inocula.

The ameliorative potential of the AT1R blocker olmesartan (OLM) on oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines has received considerable attention in recent years. Acetic acid (AA)-induced UC demonstrates close resemblance to human UC regarding histopathological features and cytokine profile and is associated with local intense immune response, oxidative stress and release of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, The effect of OLM (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg) administered orally to rats subjected to intra-rectal instillation of 2 ml of 3% AA in saline solution is investigated. The study revealed that OLM ameliorated colon injury and inflammatory signs as visualized by histopathological examination. Levels of colon IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, TGF-β, and serum CRP were down-regulated, while the level of colon IL-10 was up-regulated. In a dose-dependent manner, OLM suppressed AA-induced neutrophils accumulation and improved colon anti-oxidant defense machinery. Also, OLM repressed the Bax:BCL-2 ratio and caspase3 expression. The mechanism of these protective effects was found to lay behind its ability to down-regulate gene expression and inhibit phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65 subunits. On the other hand, OLM up-regulated gene expression of Nrf-2 and HO-1. In conclusion, our data show that OLM is an Nrf2 activator, NFkB inhibitor and apoptosis inhibitor in an experimental model of ulcerative colitis. Overall, the study indicates that OLM shows promise as a potential therapy for the treatment of human inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated whether DFAIII modulates BA metabolism, including enterohepatic circulation, in the rats fed with a diet supplemented with cholic acid (CA), one of the 12α-hydroxylated BAs. After acclimation, the rats were fed with a control diet or a diet supplemented with DFAIII. After 2 weeks, each group was further divided into two groups and was fed diet with or without CA supplementation at 0.5 g/kg diet.

It is shown that the prepared nanocomposites are composed of metallic Ag and wurtzite ZnO. The photocatalytic performance of different composites is evaluated by the degradation of Famotidine (FMT) under UV irradiation. The results indicate it that the maximum photodegradation rate is obtained with 6 wt% metallic Ag-decorated ZnO, and it is 2.1 times better than that obtained with pure ZnO. The photocatalytic degradation of FMT with Ag/ZnO is affected by various parameters such as calcination temperature and time, doping concentrations and reusability.

The fecal microbiota in different groups was compared by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene pyrosequencing.Prominent dysbiosis in the gut microbiome of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis was found. Our primary findings showed that the overall species richness (alpha diversity indexes) of the microbiota was higher in patients than in controls (P < 0.05). Distance-based community analysis revealed that the microbiota differed substantially within all subgroups of patients and controls (P < 0.05). The relative abundance of species heatmap showed a tendency toward depletion for some commensal genera, such as Prevotella_6, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and other short-chain  acid ()-producing bacteria. Additionally, our results showed that all subgroups had a distinct bacterial species, with an increase in the genus Fusobacterium in the acute phase group and the genera Streptococcus and Parabacteroides in patients with relapse. However, the genus Bacteroides was very abundant in patients without relapse. Although the findings regarding the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/) ratios across the four comparison groups were not statistically significant, the F/ ratio gradually increased in patients from the acute phase group (0.87), to the disease remission group with relapse (1.06), to the group without relapse (1.28), to the healthy group (1.63).Patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis exhibit a substantial alteration in fecal microbiota composition.© 2019 The Authors.

Some non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) are defined as prebiotics and oats being one of richest sources of NSP in grains are considered as potentially having prebiotic effect. However, information on fermentation of specific NSP of oats is limited. Moreover, bacterial cross-feeding interactions in which fermentation of prebiotics is involved is poorly characterized. Here, we report the exploration of new candidates for the syntrophic bacterial interactions and fermentability of oat non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). The results obtained by differentiating composition, viscosity and concentration of oats NSP in fermentation medium showed that Bacillus licheniformis pre-digests oat NSP, degrades high viscosity of oat β-glucan and makes hemicellulose easier to access for other bacteria. Because of fermentation, . licheniformis produces lactic and succinic , which further can be used by other bacteria for cross-feeding and  production.© 2018 Vanda Sargautiene et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545915>Short-chain   and microbiota metabolites attenuate ghrelin receptor signaling.</a></h2><p>The gastrointestinal microbiota is emerging as a unique and inexhaustible source for metabolites with potential to modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The ghrelin receptor [growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)-1a] is a GPCR expressed throughout both the gut and the brain and plays a crucial role in maintaining energy balance, metabolism, and the central modulation of food intake, motivation, reward, and mood. To date, few studies have investigated the potential of the gastrointestinal microbiota and its metabolites to modulate GPCR signaling. Here we investigate the ability of short-chain   (SCFAs), lactate, and different bacterial strains, including  and  genera, to modulate GHSR-1a signaling. We identify, for what is to our knowledge the first time, a potent effect of microbiota-derived metabolites on GHSR-1a signaling with potential significant consequences for host metabolism and physiology. We show that SCFAs, lactate, and bacterial supernatants are able to attenuate ghrelin-mediated signaling through the GHSR-1a. We suggest a novel route of communication between the gut microbiota and the host  modulation of GHSR-1a receptor signaling.

The co-solvent is most often an alcohol and may contain a third component in small proportions, called an additive (acid, base or salt). In the first part of this series, the effects of mobile phase additives on the polarity and apparent pH of the mobile phase were explored. In the present paper, we examine the effects pertaining to adsorption of additives on the stationary phase. Ammonium acetate was selected as a representative case, because it is often employed in current practice. To favour its solubility and further improve chromatographic quality, a small portion of water is also advocated. First, the equilibration time is observed to be largely increased in the presence of an additive, especially when mobile phase compositions containing only low proportions of methanol co-solvent are employed. Secondly, the effects of ammonium acetate are more thoroughly assessed with a modified version of the solvation parameter model (five Abraham descriptors and two descriptors to take account of positive and negative charges on ionizable species). On a hybrid silica stationary phase (ACQUITY UPC BEH), the effects of increasing concentration of ammonium acetate (0-25 mM in the methanol co-solvent) are investigated. The retention of acidic species is the most strongly affected, with a continuous retention increase when additive concentration increases. The retention of basic and neutral species is also moderately affected. Then thirty-two stationary phases based on sub-2 μm totally porous particles or sub-3 μm superficially porous particles are characterized with and without 20 mM ammonium acetate and 2% water in the methanol co-solvent. The effects of adsorbed additive on the interaction capabilities are discussed. Finally, the interest of introducing the additive in the dilution solvent, a method that was sometimes recommended to simplify the workflow, is also discussed with a model basic compound.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

However, their effects on human microbiota at non-lethal concentrations remain poorly understood. In this study, the interactions among 1 μg mL AgNPs, the intestinal microbiota, and the probiotic Bacillus subtilis (BS) were tested using in-vitro batch fermentation models inoculated with human fecal matter. Results from metagenomic investigations revealed that the core bacterial community was not affected by the exposure of AgNPs and BS at the later stage of fermentation, while the proportions of rare species changed drastically with the treatments. Furthermore, shifts in the Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes (F/) ratios were observed after 24 h with an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes species and a decrease in Bacteroidetes in all fermentation cultures. The co-exposure to AgNPs and BS led to the lowest F/ ratio. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization analyses indicated that non-lethal concentration of AgNPs negatively affected the relative percentage of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectales taxa in the fermentation cultures after 24 h. However, exposure to single and combined treatments of AgNPs and BS did not change the overall diversity of the fecal microflora. Functional differences in cell motility, translation, transport, and xenobiotics degradation occurred in AgNPs-treated fermentation cultures but not in AgNPs+BS-treated samples. Compared to the control samples, treated fecal cultures showed no significant statistical differences in terms of short-chain   profiles, cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on Caco-2 cell monolayers. Overall, AgNPs did not affect the composition and diversity of the core fecal microflora and its metabolic and toxic profiles. This work indicated a chemopreventive role of probiotic on fecal microflora against AgNPs, which were shown by the decrease of F/ ratio and the unaltered state of some key metabolic pathways.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Previously, we reported that short and medium   and cholecalciferol reduce S. aureus internalization into pretreated-bMECs with these molecules suggesting a role as immunomodulatory agents. Hence, we assessed the role of sodium butyrate (NaB), sodium octanoate (NaO) and cholecalciferol on S. aureus adhesin expression and its internalization into bMECs. S. aureus pre-treated 2 h with 0.5 mM or 2 mM NaB showed a reduction in internalization into bMECs (∼35% and ∼55%; respectively), which coincided with a down-regulated expression of clumping factor  (ClfB). Also, the S. aureus internalization reduction by 2 mM NaB (2 h) agreed with a down-regulated expression of sdrC. Moreover, the 2 mM NaB (24 h) pre-treatment induced bacterial internalization (∼3-fold), which was related with an up-regulation of spa, clfB and sdrC genes. Also, NaO (0.25 mM and 1 mM) only reduced S. aureus internalization when bacteria were grown 2 h with this molecule but there was no relationship with adhesin expression. In addition, cholecalciferol (50 nM) reduced bacteria internalization at similar levels (∼50%) when bacteria were grown 2 and 24 h in broth supplemented with this compound, which correlated with spa and sdrC mRNA expression down-regulated at 2 h, and fnba and clfB mRNA expression decreased at 24 h. In conclusion, our data support the fact that   and cholecalciferol regulate adhesin gene expression as well as bacteria internalization in nonprofessional phagocytic cells, which may lead to development of anti-virulence agents for control of pathogens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In healthy breast-fed infants, the gut microbiota is dominated by Bifidobacterium spp.. Cutibacterium avidum is among the initial colonizers, however, the phylogenetic relationship of infant fecal isolates to isolates from other body sites, and C. avidum carbon utilization related to the infant gut ecosystem have been little investigated. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic and phenotypic diversity of 28 C. avidum strains, including 16 strains isolated from feces of healthy infants. We investigated the in vitro capacity of C. avidum infant isolates to degrade and consume carbon sources present in the infant gut, and metabolic interactions of C. avidum with infant associated Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Isolates of C. avidum showed genetic heterogeneity. C. avidum consumed d- and l-lactate, glycerol, glucose, galactose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and maltodextrins. Alpha-galactosidase- and β-glucuronidase activity were a trait of a group of non-hemolytic strains, which were mostly isolated from infant feces. Beta-glucuronidase activity correlated with the ability to ferment glucuronic acid. Co-cultivation with . infantis and . bifidum enhanced C. avidum growth and production of propionate, confirming metabolic cross-feeding. This study highlights the phylogenetic and functional diversity of C. avidum, their role as secondary glycan degraders and propionate producers, and suggests adaptation of a subpopulation to the infant gut.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Four treatments for each diet were evaluated in an  batch culture system over 24 h: (1) control with no addition of substrates; (2) 4 g YSP/l; (3) 5 g IN/l; (4) 4 g YSP/l in combination with 5 g IN/l of faecal culture of dogs fed Diet L or H. Several changes in fermentation metabolites were analysed. Samples incubated with the faecal inocula of dogs fed Diet L produced higher concentrations of total , propionate ( = 0.001), acetate ( ≤ 0.001), d-lactate ( = 0.041) and indole ( = 0.003), whereas pH ( = 0.004) was decreased. Supplementation of IN increased the content of putrescine, d- and l-lactate, total , acetate, propionate, -butyrate ( ≤ 0.001) and -valerate ( = 0.003), while -valerate, indole and pH ( ≤ 0.001) were reduced. Ammonia was lower ( = 0.013) in samples with faecal inocula from dogs fed Diet H and further reduced by the addition of IN ( ≤ 0.001). Samples with faecal inocula from dogs fed Diet L had a fewer quotient of ammonia and total  ( = 0.040). Supplementation of YSP ( = 0.021), IN ( ≤ 0.001) and YSP in combination with IN ( = 0.047) led to a higher reduction of the quotient of ammonia and total .

PHAs gained much attention due to its inherent biodegradable and biocompatible ability along with its physicochemical properties, which are similar to those of conventional petroleum-based plastics. In the present study, PHA producing bacterial strains was isolated from earthworm. Initially, four bacterial strains were selected based on the intensity of fluorescence from 80 non-clonal isolates. Bacillus thuringiensis (.t.) E101 was identified as the bacterium producing highest yield of PHA (3.6 ± 0.04 g L ) through biochemical and molecular techniques such as 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Growth parameters such as carbon, nitrogen sources, and incubation time were optimized with respect to higher PHA production. Both qualitative (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance) and quantitative (GC-MS) characterizations revealed that the polymer produced by .t.E101 contains the characteristic peaks for poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) copolymer.

However, an increasing number of reports have suggested that in some cases effectiveness declines after a long treatment period, the reason being unclear. We have reported previously that long-term IFN-γ treatment induces malignant transformation of healthy lactating bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) in vitro. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the malignant proliferation of BMECs under IFN-γ treatment. The primary BMECs used in this study were stimulated by IFN-γ (10 ng/mL) for a long term to promote malignancy. We observed that IFN-γ could promote malignant cell proliferation, increase the expression of cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), decrease the expression of p21, and upregulate the expression of cellular-abelsongene (c-Abl) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2). The HDAC2 inhibitor, valproate (VPA) and the c-Abl inhibitor, imatinib, lowered the expression level of cyclin D1/CDK4, and increased the expression level of p21, leading to an inhibitory effect on IFN-γ-induced malignant cell growth. When c-Abl was downregulated, the HDAC2 level was also decreased by promoted proteasome degradation. These data suggest that IFN-γ promotes the growth of malignant BMECs through the c-Abl/HDAC2 signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that long-term application of IFN-γ may be closely associated with the promotion of cell growth and even the carcinogenesis of breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31342760>Response of gastrointestinal fermentative activity and colonic microbiota to protected sodium butyrate and protected sodium heptanoate in weaned piglets challenged with ETEC F4.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the potential of two new fat-protected butyrate or heptanoate salts to improve gut health and control post-weaning colibacillosis in weaning piglets challenged with enterotoxigenic  (ETEC) F4, particularly focusing on their impact on intestinal microbiota and fermentative activity along the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Seventy-two 21-d-old pigs were fed a plain diet (CTR) or supplemented with sodium butyrate (BUT) or sodium heptanoate (HPT), both at 0.3%. After a week of adaptation, animals were orally challenged at days 8 and 9 with 5.8 · 10 and 6.6 · 10 cfu, respectively, and were euthanised on d 4 and d 8 post-inoculation (PI) ( = 8) to collect blood, digesta and tissue samples and characterise microbial groups, pathogen loads (qPCR), fermentation, ileal histomorphometry and immune markers. Colonic microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene MiSeq sequencing. Supplementing both acid salts did not compensate clinical challenge effects nor performance impairments and neither histomorphometry nor serum biomarkers. Changes in the gastric fermentative activity were registered, BUT reducing lactic acid concentrations (day 8 PI), and with HPT fewer animals presenting detectable concentrations of propionic, butyric and valeric . At ileum BUT increased acetic acid concentration (day 8 PI), and both additives reduced short-chain   () in the colon. Increases in enterobacteria and coliforms counts in ileal digesta (day 4 PI,  < 0.10) and mucosa scrapes ( < 0.05) were registered although  F4 gene copies were unaffected. Regarding changes in the colonic microbiota (day 4 PI), Prevotellaceae and  were promoted with BUT supplementation whereas only minor groups were modified in HPT-treated animals. Summarising, although the pathogen loads or inflammatory mediators remained unresponsive, butyrate and heptanoate showed a significant impact on microbial fermentation along the whole GIT, being able to modify different bacterial groups at the colon. It could be hypothesised that these effects might be mediated by a carry-over effect of the changes observed in gastric fermentation, but possibly also to a better nutrient digestion in the foregut as a result of the reduced colonic  concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623169>Urolithin Metabotypes Can Determine the Modulation of Gut Microbiota in Healthy Individuals by Tracking Walnuts Consumption over Three Days.</a></h2><p>Walnuts are rich in polyphenols ellagitannins, modulate gut microbiota (GM), and exert health benefits after long-term consumption. The metabolism of ellagitannins to urolithins via GM depends on urolithin metabotypes (UM-A, -, or -0), which have been reported to predict host responsiveness to a polyphenol-rich intervention. This study aims to assess whether UMs were associated with differential GM modulation after short-term walnut consumption. In this study, 27 healthy individuals consumed 33 g of peeled raw walnuts over three days. GM profiling was determined using 16S rRNA illumina sequencing and specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs), as well as microbial activity using short-chain   analysis in stool samples. UMs stratification of volunteers was assessed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-electro spray ionization-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) analysis of urolithins in urine samples. The gut microbiota associated with UM- was more sensitive to the walnut intervention. , and members of the Coriobacteriaceae family, including , increased exclusively in UM- subjects, while some members of the Lachnospiraceae family decreased in UM-A individuals.  and  increased in both UMs and higher acetate and propionate production resulted after walnuts intake.

Amelioration of AAGS in cats secondary to synbiotic administration has recently been demonstrated. Thus, the aim of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was to characterize associated changes in the fecal microbiome and metabolome. Sixteen healthy research cats received clindamycin with food, followed 1 h later by either a placebo or synbiotic, daily for 21 days. Fecal samples were collected during baseline, antibiotic administration, and 6 weeks after antibiotic discontinuation. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes was performed, and mass spectrometry was used to determine fecal metabolomic profiles. Results were compared using mixed-model analyses, with  < 0.05 considered significant. Alpha and beta diversity were altered significantly during treatment, with persistent changes in the Shannon and dysbiosis indices. The relative abundance of  (),  (),  (),  () and  ([]) decreased and relative abundance of  () and  () increased during treatment, followed by variable return to baseline relative abundances. Derangements in short-chain  acid (), bile acid, tryptophan, sphingolipid, polyamine, benzoic acid, and cinnaminic acid pathways occurred with significant group by time, group, and time interactions for 10, 5, and 106 metabolites, respectively. Of particular note were changes related to polyamine synthesis. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the role of these alterations in prevention of AAGS in cats, people, and other animals treated with synbiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354983>Imaging the Effects of β-Hydroxybutyrate on Peri-Infarct Neurovascular Function and Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Background and Purpose- Recent evidence suggests great potential of metabolically targeted interventions for treating neurological disorders. We investigated the use of the endogenous ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as an alternate metabolic substrate for the brain in the acute phase of ischemia because postischemic hyperglycemia and brain glucose metabolism elevation compromise functional recovery. Methods- We delivered BHB (or vehicle) 1 hour after ischemic insult induced by cortical microinjection of endothelin-1 in sensorimotor cortex of rats. Two days after ischemic insult, the rats underwent multimodal characterization of the BHB effects. We examined glucose uptake on 2-Deoxy-d-glucose chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging, cerebral hemodynamics on continuous arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging, resting-state field potentials by intracerebral multielectrode arrays, Neurological Deficit Score, reactive oxygen species production, and astrogliosis and neuronal death. Results- When compared with vehicle-administered animals, BHB-treated cohort showed decreased peri-infarct neuronal glucose uptake which was associated with reduced oxidative stress, diminished astrogliosis and neuronal death. Functional examination revealed ameliorated neuronal functioning, normalized perilesional resting perfusion, and ameliorated cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia, suggesting improved functioning. Cellular and functional recovery of the neurogliovascular unit in the BHB-treated animals was associated with improved performance on the withdrawal test. Conclusions- We characterize the effects of the ketone body BHB administration at cellular and system levels after focal cortical stroke. The results demonstrate that BHB curbs the peri-infarct glucose-metabolism driven production of reactive oxygen species and astrogliosis, culminating in improved neurogliovascular and functional recovery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30711755>Caproic acid production from acid whey via open culture fermentation - Evaluation of the role of electron donors and downstream processing.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of supplementing ethanol and lactic acid as electron donors in reverse β-oxidation for short chain carboxylic  chain elongation during anaerobic fermentation of acid whey. Best results were achieved when lactic acid was added at concentration of 300 mM. It resulted in medium chain carboxylic  (MCCAs) concentration of 5.0 g/L. In the trials with ethanol addition, the overall yield was 20% lower. Subsequently liquid-liquid extraction with ionic liquids (ILs) was investigated as a potential purification method of caproic acid. The most promising, with respect to recovery of caproic acid, was piperazinium IL [CCCPpz][NTF], however, the selectivity was only 0.39. Less effective [CCCPpz][NTF] recovered 85.9% of caproic acid while reaching a higher selectivity of 0.53. Technoeconomic model revealed that to meet the conservative value of $2.25 per kg of caproic acid, the downstream processing should not exceed $0.65 per kg.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the last decade, growing evidence has identified the gut microbiota as a potential factor in the pathophysiology of both obesity and the related metabolic disorders. The gut microbiota is known to protect gastrointestinal mucosa permeability and to regulate the fermentation and absorption of dietary polysaccharides, perhaps explaining its importance in the regulation of fat accumulation and the resultant obesity. The proposed mechanisms by which the gut microbiota could contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and the related metabolic diseases include: (a) a high abundance of bacteria that ferment carbohydrates, leading to increased rates of short-chain  acid () biosynthesis, providing an extra source of energy for the host, that is eventually stored as lipids or glucose; () increased intestinal permeability to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), resulting in elevated systemic LPS levels that aggravate low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance; (c) increased activity of the gut endocannabinoid system. Fecal transplantation studies in germ-free mice have provided crucial insights into the potential causative role of the gut microbiota in the development of obesity and obesity-related disorders. Diet +/- bariatric surgery have been reported to modulate the gut microbiota, leading to lean host phenotype body composition. This review aims to report clinical evidence for a link of the gut microbiota with human obesity and obesity-related diseases, to provide molecular insights into these associations, and to address the effect of diet and bariatric surgery on the gut microbiota, including colonic microbiota, as a potential mechanism for promoting weight loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31180117>Growth performance and gastrointestinal responses in heavy Tom turkeys fed antibiotic free corn-soybean meal diets supplemented with multiple doses of a single strain Bacillus subtilis probiotic (DSM29784)1.</a></h2><p>Growth performance and gastrointestinal (GIT) responses to a single-strain of Bacillus subtilis (SSB) were investigated using 960 Hybrid Converter Toms.

Excreta samples were collected towards the end of starter and grower-1 phases for apparent retention (AR) of components by marker method and litter moisture, respectively. Selected birds were necropsied on days 28 and 56 for GIT weight and samples for jejunal histomorphology and ceca digesta short chain   (). Supplemental SSB had linear and non-linear (P < 0.05) response on BW gain (BWG). Specifically, relative to the control, birds fed low SSB had higher BWG in starter and grower-1 phases whereas bird fed mid and high SSB had lower BWG in grower-2 and birds fed low and mid SSB had higher BWG in finisher phase. Consequently, birds fed low and mid SSB doses were heavier (P < 0.05) than control fed birds at the end of trial. The FCR response to SSB was linear and non-linear (P < 0.05) with birds fed low SSB showing lower FCR than control fed birds in starter, grower-1 and finisher phases. Supplemental SSB had linear and non-linear (P < 0.05) effects on AR of components (DM, ash, crude protein, crude fat, neutral detergent fiber, and gross energy), litter moisture, GIT weight, jejunal histomorphology, and . Relative to control, birds fed high SSB showed higher AR of components, villi height, day 56 ceca digesta total  concentration, and lower litter moisture. In conclusions, under condition of the current study, growth performance was optimized by low to mid SSB. Improved nutrient retention and indices of gut health suggested higher SSB doses may optimize growth performance under challenging farm conditions.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30562925>Butyrate Stimulates Histone H3 Acetylation, 8-Isoprostane Production, RANKL Expression, and Regulated Osteoprotegerin Expression/Secretion in MG-63 Osteoblastic Cells.</a></h2><p>Butyric acid as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor is produced by a number of periodontal and root canal microorganisms (such as , , etc.). Butyric acid may affect the biological activities of periodontal/periapical cells such as osteoblasts, periodontal ligament cells, etc., and thus affect periodontal/periapical tissue destruction and healing. The purposes of this study were to study the toxic effects of butyrate on the matrix and mineralization marker expression in MG-63 osteoblasts. Cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cellular apoptosis and necrosis were analyzed by propidium iodide/annexin V flow cytometry. The protein and mRNA expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa- ligand (RANKL) were analyzed by Western blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). OPG, soluble RANKL (sRANKL), 8-isoprostane, pro-collagen I, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), osteonectin (SPARC), osteocalcin and osteopontin (OPN) secretion into culture medium were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was checked by ALP staining. Histone H3 acetylation levels were evaluated by immunofluorescent staining (IF) and Western blot. We found that butyrate activated the histone H3 acetylation of MG-63 cells. Exposure of MG-63 cells to butyrate partly decreased cell viability with no marked increase in apoptosis and necrosis. Twenty-four hours of exposure to butyrate stimulated RANKL protein expression, whereas it inhibited OPG protein expression. Butyrate also inhibited the secretion of OPG in MG-63 cells, whereas the sRANKL level was below the detection limit. However, 3 days of exposure to butyrate (1 to 8 mM) or other HDAC inhibitors such as phenylbutyrate, valproic acid and trichostatin stimulated OPG secretion. Butyrate stimulated 8-isoprostane, MMP-2 and OPN secretion, but not procollagen I, or osteocalcin in MG-63 cells. Exposure to butyrate (2⁻4 mM) for 3 days markedly stimulated osteonectin secretion and ALP activity. In conclusion, higher concentrations of butyric acid generated by periodontal and root canal microorganisms may potentially induce bone destruction and impair bone repair by the alteration of OPG/RANKL expression/secretion, 8-isoprostane, MMP-2 and OPN secretion, and affect cell viability. However, lower concentrations of butyrate (1⁻4 mM) may stimulate ALP, osteonectin and OPG. These effects are possibly related to increased histone acetylation. These events are important in the pathogenesis and repair of periodontal and periapical destruction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30577694>Accumulation of Anthocyanin and Its Associated Gene Expression in Purple Tumorous Stem Mustard ( Brassica juncea var. tumida Tsen et Lee) Sprouts When Exposed to Light, Dark, Sugar, and Methyl Jasmonate.</a></h2><p>Tumorous stem mustard is a characteristic vegetable in Southeast Asia, as are its sprouts. The purple color of the purple variety 'Zi Ying' leaves is because of anthocyanin accumulation. The ways in which this anthocyanin accumulation is affected by the environment and hormones has remained unclear. Here, the impacts of sucrose, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), light, and dark on the growth and anthocyanin production of 'Zi Ying' sprouts were explored. The results showed that anthocyanins can be enhanced by sucrose in sprouts under light condition, and MeJA can promote anthocyanins production under light and dark conditions in sprouts. The anthocyanin biosynthetic regulatory genes BjTT8, BjMYB1, BjMYB2 and BjMYB4, and the EBGs and LBGs were upregulated under light conditions, while BjTT8, BjMYB1, and BjMYB2 and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes BjF3H and BjF3'H were upregulated under DM condition. These results indicate that sucrose and methyl jasmonate can stimulate the expression of genes encoding components of the MBW complex (MYB, bHLH, and WD40) and that they transcriptional activated the expression of LBGs and EBGs to promote the accumulation of anthocyanins in 'Zi Ying' sprouts. Our findings enhance our understanding of anthocyanin accumulation regulated by sucrose and MeJA in 'Zi Ying', which will help growers to produce anthocyanin-rich foods with benefits to human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572572>Meat quality,  compounds, and antioxidant properties of lambs fed pasture versus mixed diet.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present work was to investigate the effects of feeding regimens (pasture vs. mixed diet) on meat quality,  compounds, and antioxidant properties in lamb meat.

Major  compounds in the muscles included hexanal, heptanal, nonanal, octanal, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octen-3-ol, and 2,3-octanedione. The levels of hexanal, nonanal, and 2,3-octanedione were significantly lower in PG lamb muscle ( < 0.01). In contrast, 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol levels were higher in M lamb muscle ( < 0.01). Muscle from PG lamb exhibited higher catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity ( < 0.05). PG muscle also contained a higher radical-scavenging ability (RSA;  < 0.001) and cupric-reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC;  < 0.05). Overall, the improved antioxidant status in PG muscle inhibited lipid peroxidation (aldehydes and ketones), thereby improving the meat quality.© 2019 The Authors.

This multi-block PU was synthesized using poly (ε-caprolactone) diol (PCL-SS-PCL) and poly (2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOz-OH) as soft segments, and bis (2-isocyanatoethyl) disulfide as the hard segment. Acid-sensitive PEtOz-OH was used as a hydrophilic segment for pH sensitivity. And reduction sensitivity was induced via disulfide bonds incorporated into the hydrophobic poly (ε-caprolactone) segment of the amphiphilic PUs. The system can self-assemble to form micelles responsive to pH and reducing conditions. The properties of the micelle were studied with dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy. Doxorubicin (DOX) was chosen as a model drug. The in vitro release studies showed that PEtOz--PU(SS)--PEtOz micelle could degrade more rapidly and completely in a reductive and acidic environment [10 mM dl-Dithiothreitol, pH 5.0]. The methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and fluorescent microscopy confirmed the cytotoxicity of the DOX-loaded micelles. This work provides a promising dual-responsive drug carrier based on amphiphilic PU to achieve efficient drug delivery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321841>Effects of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation on skeletal muscle in healthy and cirrhotic rats.</a></h2><p>Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a leucine metabolite with protein anabolic effects. We examined the effects of an HMB-enriched diet in healthy rats and rats with liver cirrhosis induced by multiple doses of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). HMB increased branched-chain amino  (BCAAs; valine, leucine and isoleucine) in blood and BCAA and ATP in muscles of healthy animals. The effect on muscle mass and protein content was insignificant. In CCl4-treated animals alterations characteristic of liver cirrhosis were found with decreased ratio of the BCAA to aromatic amino  in blood and lower muscle mass and ATP content when compared with controls. In CCl4-treated animals consuming HMB, we observed higher mortality, lower body weight, higher BCAA levels in blood plasma, higher ATP content in muscles, and lower ATP content and higher cathepsin  and L activities in the liver when compared with CCl4-treated animals without HMB. We conclude that (1) HMB supplementation has a positive effect on muscle mitochondrial function and enhances BCAA concentrations in healthy animals and (2) the effects of HMB on the course of liver cirrhosis in CCl4-treated rats are detrimental. Further studies examining the effects of HMB in other models of hepatic injury are needed to determine pros and cons of HMB in the treatment of subjects with liver cirrhosis.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we demonstrate that a noncoding small RNA, SdhX, is produced by RNase E-dependent processing from the 3'UTR of the  operon, encoding enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In , SdhX negatively regulates , which encodes an enzyme critical for degradation of the signaling molecule acetyl phosphate, while the downstream  gene, encoding the enzyme critical for acetyl phosphate synthesis, is not significantly affected. This discoordinate regulation of  and  increases the accumulation of acetyl phosphate when SdhX is expressed. Mutations in  that abolish regulation of  lead to more acetate in the medium (more overflow metabolism), as well as a strong growth defect in the presence of acetate as sole carbon source, when the AckA-Pta pathway runs in reverse. SdhX overproduction confers resistance to hydroxyurea, via regulation of  SdhX abundance is tightly coupled to the transcription signals of TCA cycle genes but escapes all known posttranscriptional regulation. Therefore, SdhX expression directly correlates with transcriptional input to the TCA cycle, providing an effective mechanism for the cell to link the TCA cycle with acetate metabolism pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975531>Kinetic models of migration of melamine and formaldehyde from melamine kitchenware with data of liquid chromatography.</a></h2><p>European legislation has established a specific migration limit (SML) of 15 mg kg for formaldehyde and 2.5 mg kg for melamine. Formaldehyde resins are used in the manufacture of melamine kitchenware. Formaldehyde is listed in group 1 of the IARC list of carcinogenic compounds. To determine the quantity of formaldehyde and melamine as potential migrants from different types of melamine kitchenware (glass, mug, cutlery, big cup and bowl), a HPLC-DAD method has been implemented. This method is an alternative to the ones proposed in technical guidelines to determine formaldehyde by UV-vis spectrophotometry and melamine by HPLC. The final objective was to fit the migration kinetic curves of these two analytes in melamine kitchenware. After the method was validated, decision limit (CCα) and detection capability (CCβ) were calculated for both analytes, when the probabilities of false positive (α) and false negative (β) were fixed at 0.05; being CCβ 0.269 mg L and 0.311 mg L for melamine and formaldehyde respectively. CCα and CCβ were also calculated at the SML of both analytes. The migration testing were conducted with simulant  (3% acetic acid (w/v) in aqueous solution), the conditions of each exposure being 70 °C for 2 h. The quantities of melamine and formaldehyde found in the third exposure of the total kitchenware analysed were between 0.21 and 1.09 mg L and between 0.55 and 3.86 mg L, respectively. Migration kinetic curves were built for each type of kitchenware with the data of sixteen consecutive migration cycles (70 °C each 30 min). The SML for melamine was surpassed in the mug, in the big cup and in the bowl after eleven, thirteen and one cycles, respectively. When more cycles were carried out in the mug, the values of the accumulated quantity of formaldehyde and melamine were 15.30 and 6.79 mg L, respectively, after thirty-two cycles. Both concentrations exceeded the corresponding SML.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Although they are present at trace levels, esters play a key role in the formation of flavors, especially fruity flavors, in beverages. Low ester contents result in bland beer and unpleasant flavor. In this study, three recombinant strains, ethanol O-acyltransferase encoding EEB1 overexpression strain (31194:: EEB1), 2-enoyl thioester reductase encoding ETR1 overexpression strain (31194:: ETR1), and EEB1- ETR1 co-overexpression strain (31194:: EEB1:: ETR1), were constructed. Ethyl hexanoate production by 31194:: EEB1 and 31194:: EEB1:: ETR1 was 106% higher than that by the parental strain. Further, ethyl octanoate production by 31194:: EEB1 and 31194:: EEB1:: ETR1 was enhanced by 47 and 41%, respectively, compared with that of parental strain 31194. However, no difference was observed between 31194:: ETR1 and the parental strain in terms of ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate production. This indicates that although EEB1 overexpression in Saccharomyces pastorianus enhanced ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate production, ETR1 expression levels did not affect the extracellular concentrations of these esters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30596343>Evaluation of process performance and retained sludge properties of a psychrophilic UASB reactor for treatment of iso-plophyl alcohol (2-propanol)-containing wastewater.</a></h2><p>In this study, a continuous feeding experiment was conducted with synthetic iso-plophyl alcohol (2-propanol)-containing wastewater using a lab-scale psychrophilic UASB reactor to evaluate process performance and retained sludge properties. For smooth acclimation, methanogenic granular sludge was seeded and a proportion of 2-propanol in the synthetic wastewater containing sucrose and  was increased stepwise from 0% to 30%, 60% and then 90% of COD (chemical oxygen demand). As a result, after a 4-week period for acclimation to 2-propanol degradation, a COD removal rate of 95% was achieved at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 8.4 kg COD/m/day. Additionally, the physical properties of the retained granular sludge were maintained even when the reactor was supplied with 2-propanol-rich wastewater for more than 200 days. From the batch assays using serum bottles, methanogenic degradation of 2-propanol was observed with acetone accumulation. By comparison, 2-propanol degradation was clearly inhibited in the presence of chloroform as a specific inhibitor of methanogen. A domain archaeal community structure analysis targeting 16S rRNA genes showed the relative abundance of the genus Methanospillium was increased in the 2-propanol acclimated sludge. These results suggested Methanospillium related species in the granular sludge appreciably contributed to the direct degradation of 2-proapanol into acetone under an anaerobic condition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30476738>Influence of the early bacterial biofilms developed on vats made with seven wood types on PDO Vastedda della valle del Belìce cheese characteristics.</a></h2><p>Early vat bacterial biofilms developed spontaneously through contact with whey have been characterized on seven wood types (Castanea sativa Miller, Cedrus libani, A. Rich., Prunus avium L., Fraxinus ornus L., Juglans regia L., Pinus nigra J.F. Arnold and Populus nigra L.). The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of these biofilms on the microbiological, chemical, physical and sensory characteristics of PDO Vastedda della valle del Belìce (VdB) cheese, processed traditionally from raw ewe's milk using wooden tools. To this purpose, the experimental cheeses after 15 d of refrigerated storage were examined. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) populations dominated the microbial community of all samples. The species more frequently identified were Lactococcus lactis among starter LAB and Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Pediococcus pentosaceus among non starter LAB. Culture-independent analysis of microbiota diversity was performed by MiSeq Illumina that identified Streptococcus as major group followed by members of Enterobacteriaceae family, Lactococcus and Lactobacillus. Generally, the seven tree species did not negatively affect the physicochemical composition of VdB cheeses. Chestnut (both Sicilian and Calabrian) vats produced cheeses with significant lower hue angle (a*/*) than other wood types. Among chemical parameters, significant variations were registered for a, primary and secondary lipid oxidation state (significantly lower for the VdB cheeses produced with poplar wood), and  organic compounds (VOCs). The significant differences detected among the VOCs emitted from cheeses were not perceived by the panelists who recognized all cheeses from the different trials as similar. This study confirmed the suitability of cedar, cherry, ash, walnut, black pine and poplar as alternative woods to chestnut for the production of the wooden vats employed in cheese making for the Sicilian traditional dairy productions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

OA has not effective pharmacological treatments and new therapeutic targets are needed. Adipokines contribute to the low-grade systemic inflammation in OA. Here, we explored novel molecular mechanisms of sodium butyrate (BuNa) in modulating inflammation and chemotaxis in chondrocytes, demonstrating the direct involvement of its G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)-43.ATDC5 murine chondrocytes were stimulated with interleukin (IL)-1β, in the presence or not of BuNa, for 24 h. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the expression of inflammatory mediators and structural proteins.Butyrate reduced the expression of canonic pro-inflammatory mediators (Nos2, COX-2, IL-6), pro-inflammatory adipokines (lipocalin-2 and nesfatin-1) and adhesion molecule (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) in IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes, inhibiting several inflammatory signalling pathways (NFκ, MAPKinase, AMPK-α, PI3K/Akt). Butyrate also reduced metalloproteinase production and limited the loss of type II collagen in IL-1β-inflamed chondrocytes. The chemoattractant effect of butyrate, after different inflammatory challenges, was revealed by increased annexin (AnxA)1 levels and chemokines expression. The chemoattractant and anti-inflammatory activities of butyrate were completely blunted by GPR43 silencing using RNA interference.Taken together, our data suggest the potential application of sodium butyrate as a novel candidate in a multi-target approach for the treatment of chondrocyte inflammation and cartilage degenerative process.© 2018 The Author(s).

TEs complexation reactions with VFAs and EDTA have been incorporated in an extended ADM1 model which considers TE precipitation/dissolution reactions as well as biodegradation processes. The kinetic model tracks the dynamics of 90 state variables which constitute the components of the proposed anaerobic digestion (AD) model. The incorporation of the complexation reactions required the definition of new inorganic components (EDTA species) and new complexation process rates in the ADM1 framework. The charge balance was modified accordingly to consider the effects of the additional components.

Placenta from obese mothers showed blood vessel immaturity, hypoxia, increased transcript levels of inflammation, autophagy and altered levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers. These data suggest that maternal intestinal changes probably contribute to adverse placental adaptations and also impart an increased risk of obesity in the offspring via alterations in fetal gut development.Shifts in maternal intestinal microbiota have been implicated in metabolic adaptations to pregnancy. In the present study, we generated cohorts of female C57BL/6J mice fed a control (17% kcal fat, n = 10-14) or a high-fat diet (HFD 60% kcal from fat, n = 10-14; ad libitum) aiming to investigate the impact on the maternal gut microbiota, intestinal inflammation and gut barrier integrity, placental inflammation and fetal intestinal development at embryonic day 18.5. HFD was associated with decreased relative abundances of short-chain  acid () producing genera during pregnancy. These diet-induced shifts paralleled decreased maternal intestinal mRNA levels of  receptor Gpr41, modestly decreased cecal butyrate, and altered mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines and immune cell markers in the maternal intestine. Maternal HFD resulted in impaired gut barrier integrity, with corresponding increases in circulating maternal levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumour necrosis factor. Placentas from HFD dams demonstrated blood vessel immaturity and hypoxia; decreased free carnitine, acylcarnitine derivatives and trimethylamine-N-oxide; and altered mRNA levels of inflammation, autophagy, and ER stress markers. HFD exposed fetuses had increased activation of nuclear factor-kappa  and inhibition of the unfolded protein response in the developing intestine. Taken together, these data suggest that HFD intake prior to and during pregnancy shifts the composition of the maternal gut microbiota and impairs gut barrier integrity, resulting in increased maternal circulating LPS, which may ultimate contribute to changes in placental vascularization and fetal gut development.© 2019 The Authors.

In addition, the high expression of nuclear factor (NF)‑κ in MM cells is considered an important factor in the occurrence and development of MM. The present study aimed to determine the short‑term effects of HDACis, chidamide and valproic acid (VPA), on MM cells, their effects on NF‑κ and the underlying mechanisms. The present study measured HDAC activity, and the proliferation and apoptosis of U266 and RPMI8226 MM cells following treatment with various concentrations of chidamide and VPA for 6 and 48 h. Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of phosphorylated (p)‑Iκ kinase (IKK)α/β, NF‑κ p65 and inhibitor of NF‑κ (Iκα) in U266 and RPMI8226 cells at various time points following treatment with chidamide and VPA (0, 2, 4 and 6 h). The results revealed that chidamide and VPA had no significant effect on the HDAC activity, proliferation and apoptosis of cells at 6 h; however, cell HDAC activity and proliferation were inhibited, and apoptosis was induced at 48 h. Furthermore, the expression levels of Iκα were gradually increased over time, whereas the expression levels of NF‑κ p65 gradually decreased. These findings indicated that long‑term (48 h) treatment with the HDACis chidamide and VPA inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of MM cells; however, these HDACis had little effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis in the short term (6 h). Notably, in the short term (2‑6 h), hyperactivation of NF‑κ was inhibited via the Iκα‑NF‑κ p65 pathway. These findings indicated that cell growth may be inhibited and drug susceptibility may be promoted by blocking the NF‑κ pathway at an early stage, when HDACis are combined with other drugs in the treatment of MM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30563917>Inhibiting antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae by microbiota-mediated intracellular acidification.</a></h2><p>, , and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family are common human pathogens that have acquired broad antibiotic resistance, rendering infection by some strains virtually untreatable.

It was found that the increased expression of SIRT-1 in Hep G2.2.15 cells (HBV expressing cells) than Hep G2 cells. Next the expression of SIRT-1 and Acetylated p53 (Ac-p53) were measured in the liver biopsy samples of chronic hepatitis  (CHB) patients with high viral load and compared to CHB patients with low viral load and found that there was a high SIRT-1 expression and a low Ac-p53 levels in CHB patients with high viral load compared to CHB patients with low viral load. Incubation of butyrate inhibited SIRT-1 expression and cell proliferation. Inhibition of SIRT-1 by butyrate or SIRT-1 siRNA increased the levels of Ac-p53. The elevated Ac-p53 decreased p-akt, cyclin D1, and thereby inhibited cell proliferation. Incubation of butyrate with Hep G2.2.15 cells also inhibited HBx protein expression, HBV-DNA and hepatitis  surface antigen (HBsAg).

A week after parturition, cows were grouped into three treatments of 10 cows each and fed a control treatment containing corn silage at 300 g/kg DM. In the other treated diets, 50% or 100% of the control corn silage was substituted with beet tops silage treated with LAB included at 150 g or 300 g per kg diet. Ensiling of beet tops with LAB decreased its contents of oxalic acid and neutral detergent and acid detergent fibers but increased its contents of non-structural carbohydrate and calcium. Without affecting daily milk production and feed efficiency, beet tops silage treated with LAB diets decreased ( < 0.05) feed intake, total ruminal , acetate and propionate concentrations, energy-corrected milk yield and concentrations of milk total solids, fat, protein and energy. In conclusion, beet tops silage treated with LAB can replace corn silage in diets of lactating cows.

The aim of this study was to determine if oral  supplementation in mice alters 1) the concentration of  and related corrinoids in the distal gut, 2) the fecal microbiome, 3) short chain   (), and 4) susceptibility to experimental colitis. C57BL/6 mice (up to 24 animals/group) were supplemented with oral 3.94 µg/ml cyanocobalamin (), a dose selected to approximate a single 5 mg supplement for a human. Active vitamin  (cobalamin), and four -analogues ([ADE]CN-Cba, [2Me-ADE]CN-Cba, [2MeS-ADE]CN-Cba, CN-Cbi) were analyzed in cecal and fecal contents using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), in parallel with evaluation of fecal microbiota, cecal , and susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of different concentrations of ethyl esters added to forage on preference and short-term feed intake of goats. In the first of three trials, whole-crop maize silage was supplemented with different concentrations of EA and EL and then vacuum-stored before use. Forages sampled during the preference trial showed a good recovery of EL with a high accordance of target (naturally formed + supplemented) and analysed concentrations. Supplemented EA was not recovered, making transient storage of substrates before use in feeding trials equivocal. However, four treatments with different concentrations of EL (approximately 330, 560, 920 and 1300 mg/kg dry matter (DM)) were used for the preference trial. In Trials 2 and 3, EA and EL (with and without ethanol, respectively) were added to grass hay directly before offering the feed, each in concentrations of 0, 600 and 1200 mg/kg DM to have six treatments each. In all trials, each possible combination of treatments was offered to Saanen-type wethers (n = 10, Trial 1; n = 5, Trials 2 and 3) as free choice in preference trials. In Trial 1, there was only a weak impact of EL on preference behaviour as goats avoided medium EL concentrations, but did not avoid silages with higher concentrations. In Trials 2 and 3, there was no influence of added volatiles on short-term DM intake and preference at all. It can be concluded that it is unlikely that ethyl esters as single substance or in combination with ethanol affect preference behaviour and feed intake of ruminants. Possibly a combination or still unidentified fermentation products cause avoidance instead of a single compound.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954891>Regulating role of ethyl acetate fraction of Tephrosia tinctoria pers. in carbohydrate metabolism and oxidative stress in diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Traditionally, Tephrosia tinctoria (TT) is used as antimicrobial, larvicidal, antidiabetic and antioxidant agents. In the present study, the diabetes was induced in male albino - rats using alloxan (140 mg/kg .w.) and treated with ethyl acetate extract (100 and 200 mg/kg .w.) of T. tinctoria (TTEA) orally for 28 days. The effects of TTEA on biochemical paramets were studied. The results of this comprehensive study revealed that the TTEA significantly restored the altered parameters in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The diabetes-induced elevated levels of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis metabolism were significantly controlled by TTEA. In the same, the decreased glycogenesis, glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolisms were significantly increased by TTEA. The enzymatic and non- enzymatic antioxidant levels were significantly elevated in TTEA treated diabetic rats and also the total non-enzymatic antioxidants capacity of serum and liver homogenate were calculated though DPPH inhibition. To conclude, this study demonstrates the anti-diabetic effect of TTEA possibly mediated through regulating carbohydrate metabolism and antioxidant status.Copyright © 2019.

The pattern of cross-resistance for the TrpLeu mutation is still ambiguous. In this paper, mutant homozygote (1999Leu/Leu, RR) and wild type (1999Trp/Trp, SS) . syzigachne plants with the same genetic background were purified from the JS-26 population using the dCAPS method. The activity of ACCase in RR and SS was determined. Then, the cross-resistance pattern to ACCase inhibiting herbicides of the TrpLeu mutation was determined using the whole-plant method. ACCase activity showed that the TrpLeu mutation decreased ACCase sensitivity to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl by 2.73-fold. A dose-response experiment indicated that the TrpLeu mutation conferred high resistance to quizalofop-p-ethyl (20.29-fold), metamifop (12.22-fold) and pinoxaden (18.60-fold), moderate resistance to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (8.20-fold) and sethoxydim (6.38-fold), low resistance to cyhalofop-butyl (2.73-fold) and no resistance to clodinafop-propargyl (1.42 fold) and clethodim (1.59-fold). This is the first report of the role of TrpLeu in fenoxaprop-p-ethyl resistance and of the patterns of cross-resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides in . syzigachne.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 720, 4-week-old Shaver White chicks were allotted to control (CON), 1.1E+08 (low, LSSB), 2.2E+08 (medium, MSSB), or 1.1E+09 (high, HSSB) CFU/kg of diet groups. At grower (10-week), developer (16-week), and laying (28-week) phases, excreta and cecal digesta samples were taken for AR, microbial, and  analyses. Microbial analysis involved high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA gene. Bacterial diversity decreased ( < 0.05) at the developer phase as the SSB dose increased; however, a distinct clustering pattern ( < 0.05) of bacterial community was noted.  and  were differentially enriched in the developer for SSB-fed compared to CON-fed birds. Although no differences in microbial diversity were detected in grower and layer phases, different species of  (XVIII, XIVa, IV, and XIVb)-major butyrate producers-were identified in all phases, with stronger effect sizes for SSB-fed compared to CON-fed birds. Isobutyric acid was elevated in dose response ( = 0.034) in layer phase. In addition, the relative abundances of , , and  were positively correlated ( < 0.05), with AR of most components for SSB-fed birds in the pullet phase. The results suggested that supplementing chickens' diet with  DSM 29784 may selectively enrich beneficial bacterial communities, which in turn are critical in promoting the growth and performance of hens. In egg-laying chickens, the trend in the move away from the cage to alternative housing systems and restriction in antimicrobial use requires alternative approaches to maintain health and prevent diseases. There is increased research and commercial interest toward alternative gut health solutions while improving the performance and product safety in poultry production systems. One such approach, in recognition of the importance of the gut microbial community, is the use of microbes as feed supplements (such as probiotics). Unlike meat-type chickens, studies assessing the efficacy of such microbial supplements are limited for egg-laying chickens. Thus, by conducting a comprehensive assessment of the hen microbiota in response to various levels of  DSM 29784 during the pullet phase (grower and developer) and the layer phase, the present study demonstrates the importance of direct-fed microbes in modulating gut microbiome, which may relate to improved performance efficiency in the pullet and layer phases.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30855191>Evaluation of Pistia stratiotes fractions as effective larvicide against Anopheles mosquitoes.</a></h2><p>Mosquito are well-known vectors that cause diseases particularly malaria and filariasis which are detrimental to human health. These vectors occur mainly in tropical countries where more than 2 billion people live in endemic regions with about one million deaths been claimed yearly from malaria and filariasis. The study is aimed at evaluating the larvicidal activity of Pistia stratiotes fractions on Anopheles mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae). The ethyl acetate extract of P. stratiotes was obtained through percolation process and was chromatographed to yield nine fractions. The larvicidal activity of each of the nine fractions was tested in triplicates by exposing the larvae to 500, 250, 125, 62.5 and 31.3 µg/ml, respectively. Phytochemical screening of the nine fractions revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides and phlobatannins in varying quantities. The result obtained shows that fraction E has the highest lethal effect on the Anopheles larvae at LC =14.81 µg/ml and was weakly effective at 602.03 µg/ml on brine shrimp larvae. The gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of fraction E revealed the presence of 35 pre-cursor compounds. Hence, ethyl acetate fractions of P. stratiotes could be an effective larvicide against Anopheles mosquito larvae as it has been found to be harmless to other aquatic organisms. Further work should be done on other aquatic weeds that have larvicidal potential to isolate the bioactive compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30502468>Antioxidant, intestinal immune status and anti-inflammatory potential of Chenopodium ambrosioides L. in fish: In vitro and in vivo studies.</a></h2><p>Chenopodium ambrosioides L. has been used for centuries as traditional medicine in many clinical situations. The objectives of this study were first to assess the nutraceutical potential of C. ambrosioides L. extract through analyses of its chemical composition and antioxidant properties, followed by assessing toxicity and antioxidative activities on fish splenocytes. The second one was to perform an in vivo study using dietary C. ambrosioides L. extract (0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0%; w/w) for 15 and 30 days (2-week and 4-week treatments) to assess associated-intestine health status by short-chain  production, antioxidant enzyme activities and anti-inflammatory effects on Pacific red snapper (Lutjanus peru). Non-polar and polar fractions were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in C. ambrosioides, of which the most abundant compounds were carvacrol, phytol, squalene, vitamin E and sucrose. The extract of C. ambrosioides L. enhanced a considerable antiradical and reducing power; fish splenocytes responded positively with higher (88%) cell viability than control. The production of nitric oxide and superoxide anion, as well as superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, were also enhanced in splenocytes treated with C. ambrosioides L. The in vivo study results showed that acetate was the major short-chain  acid found in fish receiving C. ambrosioides L. after week four. Pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in intestine was modulated in fish fed with C. ambrosioides L. at any time of the experimental trial. In addition, the histological findings suggested that its extract did not cause inflammatory damage in intestine. Overall, the results suggest that C. ambrosioides L. is safe for immune cells and promoting intestinal health status of fish through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, making it an interesting additive in functional diets.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the response of ARGs and MRGs to bamboo charcoal (BC) and bamboo vinegar (BV) during aerobic composting was investigated. Results showed that BC + BV treatment reduced the abundances of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) during the thermophilic period, as well as achieved the lowest rebound during the cooling period. BC + BV promoted the growth of Firmicutes, thereby facilitating the thermophilic period of composting. The rebound of ARGs and MGEs can be explained by increasing the abundance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria at the end of composting. Composting reduced the abundances of MRGs comprising pcoA, tcrB, and cueO, whereas cusA and copA indicated the selective pressure imposed by heavy metals on bacteria. The fate of ARGs was mainly driven by MGEs, and heavy metals explained most of the variation in MRGs. Interestingly, nitrogen conversion also had an important effect on ARG and MRG profiles. Our current findings suggest that the addition of BC + BV during compost preparation is an effective method in controlling the mobility of ARGs and MRGs, thereby reducing the environmental problems.Copyright © 2019.

Sodium butyrate (SB), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, plays an important role in limiting inflammation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of SB on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice and explore the potential mechanism of SB protection. A total of 30 ICR mice were randomly divided into three groups ( n = 10): a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) intratracheal instillation group, a LPS intratracheal instillation group, and a SB gavage group (SB was given 1 h before the LPS stimulation). After 12 h, samples of the blood and lung tissue were collected from the mice for experimental analysis. The results showed that the concentration of inflammatory cytokines [interleukin 1β (IL1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)], myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the lung tissue and blood, protein abundance of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor κ (NF-κ, p65), phosphorylated p65 (p-p65), inhibitor κα (Iκα), and phosphorylated Iκα (p-Iκα), and relative mRNA expression of genes associated with inflammation, such as TLR4, NF-κ, IL1β, interleukin 6 (IL6), and TNF-α, were significantly upregulated in the LPS group compared to the PBS group. However, the SB addition markedly downregulated the levels of these parameters in the LSB group compared to those in the LPS group. Furthermore, the structure of the lung tissue from the LPS group was severely disrupted in comparison to that of the PBS group. However, with SB administration, the severe structural disruption was relieved. In addition, an immunohistochemical analysis showed that positive immunoreactions to TLR4, p65, and TNF-α were significant in the LPS group; however, SB addition markedly attenuated this phenomenon. In conclusion, the ALI mouse model was successfully established with an intratracheal instillation of LPS. Furthermore, gavage with SB inhibited inflammation in LPS-induced ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685593>A dummy molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for selective determination of four pyridine carboxylic acid herbicides in milk.</a></h2><p>We aim to develop a solid-phase extraction (SPE) based on a dummy molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) and liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for selective determination of four pyridine carboxylic acid herbicides (aminopyralid, picloram, fluroxypyr, and clopyralid) in milk samples. Using picloram as the dummy template, MIP nanocomposites with highly selective recognition and adsorption for the target molecule and its structural analogs were successfully synthesized by precipitation polymerization. Adsorption isotherms and kinetics were used to determine the adsorption performance and specific recognition mechanism of both MIPs and non-molecularly imprinted polymers (NIP). The Scatchard plot analysis revealed that two different binding sites were formed in the MIP with maximum binding capacity (Q) of 1171.8 μg·g and 3022.5 μg·g, respectively. Recovery at three spiking levels of 10, 20, and 50 μg·L ranged between 75.3 and 89.8% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) <14.3%.The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 0.124 μg·L.

Predictive models for metabolic clusters were created and validated using 3 sets of milk biomarkers (milk metabolites and enzymes, glycans on the immunogamma globulin fraction of milk, and Fourier-transform mid-infrared spectra of milk). Metabolic clusters are used to identify dairy cows with a balanced or imbalanced metabolic profile. Around 14 and 35 d in milk, serum or plasma concentrations of BHB, free  , glucose, and IGF-I were determined. Cows with a favorable metabolic profile were grouped together in what was referred to as the "balanced" group (n = 43) and were compared with cows in what was referred to as the "other balanced" group (n = 64). Cows with an unfavorable metabolic profile were grouped in what was referred to as the "imbalanced" group (n = 19) and compared with cows in what was referred to as the "other imbalanced" group (n = 88). Glucose and IGF-I were higher in balanced compared with other balanced cows. Free   and BHB were lower in balanced compared with other balanced cows. Glucose and IGF-I were lower in imbalanced compared with other imbalanced cows. Free   and BHB were higher in imbalanced cows. Metabolic clusters were related to production parameters. There was a trend for a higher daily increase in fat- and protein-corrected milk yield in balanced cows, whereas that of imbalanced cows was higher. Dry matter intake and the daily increase in dry matter intake were higher in balanced cows and lower in imbalanced cows. Energy balance was continuously higher in balanced cows and lower in imbalanced cows. Weekly or twice-weekly milk samples were taken and milk metabolites and enzymes (milk glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, BHB, lactate dehydrogenase, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, isocitrate), immunogamma globulin glycans (19 peaks), and Fourier-transform mid-infrared spectra (1,060 wavelengths reduced to 15 principal components) were determined. Milk biomarkers with or without additional cow information (days in milk, parity, milk yield features) were used to create predictive models for the metabolic clusters. Accuracy for prediction of balanced (80%) and imbalanced (88%) cows was highest using milk metabolites and enzymes combined with days in milk and parity. The results and models of the present study are part of the GplusE project and identify novel milk-based phenotypes that may be used as predictors for metabolic and performance traits in early-lactation dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

A total of 1,600 one-day-old Cobb 500 male broiler chicks received either a control diet or the same diet to which . subtilis 29784 spores were added (1E8 CFU/kg of feed). The birds were slaughtered at 42 D of age. Ileal and cecal tissues and content were collected for histomorphological analysis and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. The inclusion of . subtilis 29784 led to an increase of final body weight gain of broilers (+5.7%; P < 0.0001) and an improvement in feed conversion ratio (-5.4%; P < 0.0001). Higher feed efficiency in the Bacillus-fed group was correlated with a significant increase in intestinal microvilli length (+18% in ileum and +17% in cecum; P < 0.001). Among the differences revealed by 16S rRNA analysis, Ruminococcus, Lachnoclostridium, and Anaerostipes were found in higher relative abundance in Bacillus-treated birds at the cecal level. These bacterial genera include species that produce butyrate, the main source of energy for enterocytes and known to be an immune modulator. There was also a slight increase in the Butyrivibrio genus in the cecum, which is known to be an important player in the production of conjugated linoleic acid, also considered an anti-inflammatory compound. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of . subtilis 29784 significantly improved the growth performance of broilers, likely through beneficial effects on microbiota and host.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30582442>A Proinflammatory Gut Microbiota Increases Systemic Inflammation and Accelerates Atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Several studies have suggested a role for the gut microbiota in inflammation and atherogenesis. A causal relation relationship between gut microbiota, inflammation, and atherosclerosis has not been explored previously.Here, we investigated whether a proinflammatory microbiota from Caspase1 ( Casp1) mice accelerates atherogenesis in Ldlr mice.We treated female Ldlr mice with antibiotics and subsequently transplanted them with fecal microbiota from Casp1 mice based on a cohousing approach. Autologous transplantation of fecal microbiota of Ldlr mice served as control. Mice were cohoused for 8 or 13 weeks and fed chow or high-fat cholesterol-rich diet. Fecal samples were collected, and factors related to inflammation, metabolism, intestinal health, and atherosclerotic phenotypes were measured. Unweighted Unifrac distances of 16S rDNA (ribosomal DNA) sequences confirmed the introduction of the Casp1 and Ldlr microbiota into Ldlr mice (referred to as Ldlr( Casp1) or Ldlr( Ldlr) mice). Analysis of atherosclerotic lesion size in the aortic root demonstrated a significant 29% increase in plaque size in 13-week high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) mice compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. We found increased numbers of circulating monocytes and neutrophils and elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels in plasma in high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. Neutrophil accumulation in the aortic root of Ldlr( Casp1) mice was enhanced compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. 16S-rDNA-encoding sequence analysis in feces identified a significant reduction in the short-chain  acid-producing taxonomies Akkermansia, Christensenellaceae, Clostridium, and Odoribacter in Ldlr( Casp1) mice. Consistent with these findings, cumulative concentrations of the anti-inflammatory short-chain   propionate, acetate and butyrate in the cecum were significantly reduced in 13-week high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice.Introduction of the proinflammatory Casp1 microbiota into Ldlr mice enhances systemic inflammation and accelerates atherogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30483748>HOXA5 inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells via regulation of protein kinase  and p27.</a></h2><p>Homeobox A5 (HOXA5) is a member of the homeobox gene (HOX) family, which plays an important role in the development of various malignant tumors. Here, we speculated that HOXA5 has an effect on cervical cancer development. In our study, we aimed to explore the role and molecular mechanism of HOXA5 in regards to the cell proliferation and apoptosis in cervical cancer. We found that expression levels of HOXA5 measured by RT‑qPCR and western blot assays in cervical cancer cell lines and tissues were both significantly downregulated. We performed a gain‑of‑function experiment by the transfection with pcDNA.3.1‑HOXA5 in ME‑180 and HT‑3 cells to overexpress HOXA5, and the caspase‑3 activity measured by caspase‑3 activity assay kit and cell apoptosis detected by flow cytometry were obviously promoted. Meanwhile, cell proliferation tested by BrdU assay, invasion determined by Transwell and cell viability tested by MTT were inhibited. Moreover, protein kinase  (AKT) was activated by incubation with SC79 (AKT activator; 1 µg/ml) after HOXA5 overexpression, and reversed the effect of HOXA5 overexpression on p27 expression. Additionally, significant elevation of AKT activation measured by western blot analysis abrogated the effect of HOXA5 on caspase‑3 activity, cell apoptosis, proliferation, invasion and cell viability. Taken together, this study revealed that HOXA5 inhibits cervical cancer progression by regulating AKT/p27, proposing the potential role of HOXA5 in the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30355800>Antibiotics induce sustained dysregulation of intestinal T cell immunity by perturbing macrophage homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Macrophages in the healthy intestine are highly specialized and usually respond to the gut microbiota without provoking an inflammatory response. A breakdown in this tolerance leads to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the mechanisms by which intestinal macrophages normally become conditioned to promote microbial tolerance are unclear. Strong epidemiological evidence linking disruption of the gut microbiota by antibiotic use early in life to IBD indicates an important role for the gut microbiota in modulating intestinal immunity. Here, we show that antibiotic use causes intestinal macrophages to become hyperresponsive to bacterial stimulation, producing excess inflammatory cytokines. Re-exposure of antibiotic-treated mice to conventional microbiota induced a long-term, macrophage-dependent increase in inflammatory T helper 1 (T1) responses in the colon and sustained dysbiosis. The consequences of this dysregulated macrophage activity for T cell function were demonstrated by increased susceptibility to infections requiring T17 and T2 responses for clearance (bacterial  and helminth  infections), corresponding with increased inflammation. Short-chain   (SCFAs) were depleted during antibiotic administration; supplementation of antibiotics with the  butyrate restored the characteristic hyporesponsiveness of intestinal macrophages and prevented T cell dysfunction. Butyrate altered the metabolic behavior of macrophages to increase oxidative phosphorylation and also promoted alternative macrophage activation. In summary, the gut microbiota is essential to maintain macrophage-dependent intestinal immune homeostasis, mediated by -dependent pathways. Oral antibiotics disrupt this process to promote sustained T cell-mediated dysfunction and increased susceptibility to infections, highlighting important implications of repeated broad-spectrum antibiotic use.Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

A total of 324 1-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly assigned to three treatments with six cages of 18 chicks. Treatments were: (a) Control, 80 mg/kg Zn from ZnSO ; () POS, 80 mg/kg Zn from ZnSO + 482 mg/kg POS (the same amount of POS as treatment 3); and (c) Zn-POS, 80 mg/kg zinc from Zn-POS. Compared to the Control, both POS and Zn-POS supplementation increased average daily gain and reduced the mortality during day 22-42, and only Zn-POS supplementation decreased the ratio of feed to gain during day 22-42 and 1-42. Moreover, both POS and Zn-POS supplementation improved Zn status and gut function as evidenced by increased metallothionein concentrations in the pancreas, villus height in the duodenum and isobutyrate concentrations in the caecal digesta. Additionally, Zn-POS supplementation increased gene expressions of metallothionein, Zn transporter 1, Zn transporter 2 in the pancreas, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 in the liver, the concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate and total  in the caecal digesta and the villus height to crypt depth ratio in the duodenum and jejunum, whereas decreased the crypt depth in these two tissues. Altogether, our results revealed that dietary POS or Zn-POS supplementation benefited growth performance, Zn status, antioxidant ability and gut function of broilers. Supplementing Zn-POS in the form of chelate was more effective than feeding POS or ZnSO separately.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31025252>Silibinin inhibits in vitro ketosis by regulating HMGCS2 and NF-kB: elucidation of signaling molecule relationship under ketotic conditions.</a></h2><p>Ketosis is a condition where ketone bodies are produced as an alternative energy source, due to insufficient glucose for energy production so that the body switches from carbohydrate metabolism to mostly fat metabolism. In this study, we examined the anti-ketosis effects of silibinin, a major active component of silymarin. We induced ketosis in FL83B mouse hepatocytes in vitro by culturing in low glucose media and compared results to hepatocytes maintained in high-glucose conditions. We quantified β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels with a colorimetric assay. In low-glucose conditions, silibinin reduced the amount of BHB produced, compared to high-glucose conditions; thus, silibinin exhibited an anti-ketotic effect. Ketone body formation during beta oxidation is mediated by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2). The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-kB) regulates the transcription of HMGCS2, and plays a vital role in BHB levels. We showed that silibinin inhibited the expression of HMGCS2 and NF-kB at transcriptional and translational levels. Silibinin also inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-kB and its DNA binding activity. To elucidate the relationship between HMGCS2 and NF-kB, we tested inhibited and over-expressed NF-kB. We found that NF-kB acted as a positive regulator for HMGCS2 under ketosis treatment conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30986904>Human Multilineage 3D Spheroids as a Model of Liver Steatosis and Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disorder in western countries. Despite the high prevalence of NAFLD, the underlying biology of the disease progression is not clear, and there are no approved drugs to treat non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the most advanced form of the disease. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing advanced in vitro human cellular systems to study disease mechanisms and drug responses. We attempted to create an organoid system genetically predisposed to NAFLD and to induce steatosis and fibrosis in it by adding free  . We used multilineage 3D spheroids composed by hepatocytes (HepG2) and hepatic stellate cells (LX-2) with a physiological ratio (24:1). HepG2 and LX-2 cells are homozygotes for the  I148M sequence variant, the strongest genetic determinant of NAFLD. We demonstrate that hepatic stellate cells facilitate the compactness of 3D spheroids. Then, we show that the spheroids develop accumulations of fat and collagen upon exposure to free  . Finally, this accumulation was rescued by incubating spheroids with liraglutide or elafibranor, drugs that are in clinical trials for the treatment of NASH. In conclusion, we have established a simple, easy to handle, in vitro model of genetically induced NAFLD consisting of multilineage 3D spheroids. This tool may be used to understand molecular mechanisms involved in the early stages of fibrogenesis induced by lipid accumulation. Moreover, it may be used to identify new compounds to treat NASH using high-throughput drug screening.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30871432>Supplementation of dietary non-digestible oligosaccharides from birth onwards improve social and reduce anxiety-like behaviour in male BALB/c mice.</a></h2><p>The intestinal microbiota is acknowledged to be essential in brain development and behaviour. Their composition can be modulated by prebiotics such as short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides (scGOS) and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharide (lcFOS). Several studies reported potential health benefit of prebiotics on behaviour. As the prebiotic mixture of scGOS and lcFOS is included in infant formula, we investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with this specific mixture from the day of birth onwards on behaviour and intestinal microbiota development in mice.Healthy male BALB/cByJ mice received, from day of birth, a dietary supplement with or without 3% scGOS:lcFOS (9:1). Behavioural tests were performed pre-weaning, in adolescence, early adulthood and adulthood. We assessed faecal microbiota compositions over time, caecal short-chain   as well as brain mRNA expression of Htr1a, Htr1b and Tph2 and monoamine levels.Compared to control fed mice, scGOS:lcFOS fed mice showed reduced anxiety-like and repetitive behaviour over time and improved social behaviour in adulthood. The serotonergic system in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and somatosensory cortex (SSC) was affected by the scGOS:lcFOS. In the PFC, mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) was enhanced in scGOS:lcFOS fed mice. Although the bacterial diversity of the intestinal microbiota was unaffected by the scGOS:lcFOS diet, microbiota composition differed between the scGOS:lcFOS and the control fed mice over time. Moreover, an increased saccharolytic and decreased proteolytic fermentation activity were observed in caecum content.Supplementing the diet with scGOS:lcFOS from the day of birth is associated with reduced anxiety-like and improved social behaviour during the developmental period and later in life, and modulates the composition and activity of the intestinal microbiota in healthy male BALB/c mice. These data provide further evidence of the potential impact of scGOS:lcFOS on behaviour at several developmental stages throughout life and strengthen the insights in the interplay between the developing intestine and brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169448>Reactor performance and economic evaluation of singular, binary, and ternary mixing of feedstocks for anaerobic digestion.</a></h2><p>This study compared the performance of singular, binary, and ternary mixing of feedstocks for anaerobic digestion.

The mixed micelles were prepared by co-assembling the two conjugates with a particle size about 98.5 nm. The mixed micelles could release anticancer drug DOX and PTX upon cellular reduction once they came into the cancerous cells. Moreover, the mixed micelles displayed synergistic effect in vitro and the combination therapy in micellar dosage-form led to reduced systematic toxicity and enhanced antitumor efficacy in vivo.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have significant therapeutic effects on non-alcoholic  liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) in animal models. However, clinical studies indicated that GLP-1 treatment had little effect on hepatic steatosis in some NAFLD patients, suggesting that GLP-1 resistance may occur in these patients. It is well-known that the gut metabolite sodium butyrate (NaB) could promote GLP-1 secretion from intestinal L cells. However, it is unclear whether NaB improves hepatic GLP-1 responsiveness in NAFLD. In the current study, we showed that the serum GLP-1 levels of NAFLD patients were similar to those of normal controls, but hepatic GLP-1R expression was significantly downregulated in NAFLD patients. Similarly, in the NAFLD mouse model, mice fed with a high-fat diet showed reduced hepatic GLP-1R expression, which was reversed by NaB treatment and accompanied by markedly alleviated liver steatosis. In addition, NaB treatment also upregulated the hepatic p-AMPK/p-ACC and insulin receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1 expression levels. Furthermore, NaB-enhanced GLP-1R expression in HepG2 cells by inhibiting histone deacetylase-2 independent of GPR43/GPR109a. These results indicate that NaB is able to prevent the progression of NAFL to NASH via promoting hepatic GLP-1R expression. NaB is a GLP-1 sensitizer and represents a potential therapeutic adjuvant to prevent NAFL progression to NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30395776>Inulin-type fructans improve active ulcerative colitis associated with microbiota changes and increased short-chain   levels.</a></h2><p>The intestinal microbiota is involved in ulcerative colitis (UC) pathogenesis. Prebiotics are hypothesized to improve health through alterations to gut microbiota composition and/or activity. Our aim was therefore to determine if inulin-type fructans induce clinical benefits in UC, and identify if benefits are linked to compositional and/or functional shifts of the luminal (fecal) and mucosal (biopsy) bacterial communities. Patients (n = 25) with mild/moderately active UC received 7.5 g (n = 12) or 15 g (n = 13) daily oral oligofructose-enriched inulin (Orafti®Synergy1) for 9 weeks. Total Mayo score, endoscopic activity and fecal calprotectin were assessed. Fecal and mucosal bacterial communities were characterized by 16S rRNA tag sequencing, and short chain   () production were measured in fecal samples. Fructans significantly reduced colitis in the high-dose group, with 77% of patients showing a clinical response versus 33% in the low-dose group (= 0.04). Fructans increased colonic butyrate production in the 15 g/d dose, and fecal butyrate levels were negatively correlated with Mayo score (r = -0.50; 0.036). The high fructan dose led to an increased  and  abundance but these shifts were not correlated with improved disease scores. In summary, this pilot study revealed that 15 g/d dose inulin type fructans in UC produced functional but not compositional shifts of the gut microbiota, suggesting that prebiotic-induced alterations of gut microbiota metabolism are more important than compositional changes for the benefits in UC. The findings warrant future well-powered controlled studies for the use of β-fructans as adjunct therapy in patients with active UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30439638>Influence of hybrid polymeric nanoparticle/thermosensitive hydrogels systems on formulation tracking and in vitro artificial membrane permeation: A promising system for skin drug-delivery.</a></h2><p>In recent years, the development of hybrid drug delivery systems, such as hydrogels and nanoparticles, has gained considerable attention as new formulations for skin-delivery. Meanwhile, transdermal diffusion synthetic membranes have been used to assess skin permeability to these systems, providing key insights into the relationships between drug and nanoformulations. In this study, benzocaine-loaded poly-ε-caprolactone nanoparticles (BZC:NPs) were synthesized, characterized and incorporated into Poloxamer 407-based hydrogel (PL407). Benzocaine (BZC) was used as a drug model since has been commonly applied as a topical pain reliever in the last years. Hence, we developed a hybrid polymeric nanoparticle/thermosensitive hydrogels system and evaluated the in vitro permeation of the BZC, as well as nanoformulation tracking in an artificial membrane. In vitro permeation study was conducted in a vertical diffusion cell system using a Strat-M membrane model. BZC:NPs were prepared by coprecipitation method and their physicochemical stability measured before incorporating into the thermosensitive hydrogel. Also, viscosity measurements and sol-gel transition temperature were performed by rheological analysis. Different techniques, including microscopy, were used to tracking the nanoparticles on both receptor medium and synthetic membranes. Results showed high BZC encapsulation efficiency into NPs (93%) and good physicochemical stability before and after hydrogel incorporation. BZC in vitro permeation kinetics from NPs-loaded Poloxamer 407-based hydrogel presented slower permeation profile compared with the BZC: Poloxamer 407-based hydrogel. Also, NPs were observed into the diffusion cells receptor compartment after the in vitro permeation study. These results contribute to a better understanding the interaction between hydrogels, nanoparticles and synthetic membrane, as well as open perspectives for the development of new drug delivery systems for skin.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

Transformation systems for marine Nannochloropsis species have been established in the recent decade, however, genetic manipulation of Nannochloropsis limnetica, the only known freshwater species in this genus, is not yet available. Based on established marine Nannochloropsis species electrotransformation protocol, nuclear genetic transformation was established in N. limnetica, meanwhile the appropriate antibiotic selection concentration and electric field strength of electroporation were determined. For the selection of transformants in N. limnetica on plates, 0.07 μg mL of zeocin or 5 μg mL of hygromycin  was proved sufficient, and the transformation efficiency was < 2 × 10 with a single pulse ranging from 2200 to 2600 V using 2-mm electroporation cuvettes. Pretreatment of N. limnetica with 10 mM lithium acetate and 3 mM dithiothreitol before electroporation increased transformation efficiency hundreds of times, and the highest transformation efficiency of 10-11 × 10 was obtained with an electric field strength of 12,000 V/cm. Our results help to expand the biotechnological applications of this freshwater species and provide means for successful electrotransformation of other microalgae as well.

Some of the major  compounds (acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and 2-phenylethanol) were found above their perception thresholds. Esters and terpenic compounds were the groups of volatiles expressed the most in blueberry wines, followed by , alcohols, and norisoprenoids (3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-β-ionone, 3-oxo-α-ionol, and 3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-β-ionol). The wines that experienced bottle-aging are characterized by high concentrations of ethyl esters, diethyl succinate, ethyl lactate, and diethyl malonate.

However, to reduce the cost of alkalinity supplementation, cost-effective reactor operation method has been desired. This study aimed to reduce the alkalinity supplementation for a thermophilic (55°C) multi-feed up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (MF UASB) reactor for the low-cost treatment of the wastewater from the production of the Japanese distilled alcohol called .  distillery wastewater contains high concentrations of organics (46,500-57,600 mgCOD L; COD: chemical oxygen demand) and  (16,200-25,000 mgCOD L), and low pH (4.1-4.5). With alkalinity supplementation of 0.045 mgCaCO mgCOD using 24% NaOH, the MF UASB reactor achieved an 87 ± 2% COD removal rate with an organic loading rate of 24 kgCOD m day for 554 days reactor operation (hydraulic retention time of 10 h and influent concentration of 10,000 mgCOD L). The organic removal rate decreased to 19 ± 3% in the MF UASB reactor when alkalinity supplementation was reduced to 0.015 mgCaCO·mgCOD.

Here, we uncovered three major terpenes released from the shoots of Eo: (E)-β-ocimene (6%), α-muurolene (87.8%), and eremophilene (6.2%). Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment increased the emission of monoterpenes, including (E)- and (Z)-β-ocimene, limonene, and myrcene, as well as sesquiterpene blends of (E)-caryophyllene, α-copaene, (+)-cyclosativene, and α-farnesene. RNA sequencing analysis predicted 14 putative Eo terpene synthase (EoTPS) genes, and two full-length EoTPS were successfully amplified: Eo7816 (1722 bp) and Eo6039 (1701 bp). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Eo7816 and Eo6039 belonged to the clades of TPS- and TPS-a, respectively. The Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing Eo7816 exclusively released (E)-β-ocimene (96%) with (Z)-β-ocimene and myrcene. In contrast, Eo6039-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants emitted significant amounts of α-muurolene (69.4%) and eremophilene (21.8%).

The links between glucose deregulation and eventual mortal cardiac diseases are still being investigated. However, several reports have implicated elevated uric acid (UA) in the progression of metabolic disorders especially during high-fructose diet. Also, butyrate (BUT) a short-chain  acid is being identified with intriguing therapeutic potentials in metabolic disorders. We therefore hypothesized that high-fat diet-induced glucose deregulation and cardiac tissue damage are associated with elevated UA and attenuated by BUT in female rats. Twenty-four 10-week-old female Wistar rats with weights ranging from 135 to 150 g were treated with normal rat chow and distilled water (po) or sodium butyrate (200 mg/kg; po) or high-fat diet and distilled water (po) or high-fat diet and sodium butyrate. Treatments lasted for 6 weeks. Results showed that high-fat diet caused glucose dysmetabolism, elevated plasma triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), corticosterone, malondialdehyde (MDA), plasma and cardiac UA, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). High-fat diet also led to depressed reduced glutathione (GSH). Histological analysis of cardiac tissue showed cellular infarction, infiltration, and fibrosis in high-fat diet-fed rats. However, all these effects were ameliorated by BUT treatment. The findings here showed that high-fat diet resulted in glucose dysmetabolism and cardiac tissue damage through a UA-dependent mechanism and that BUT can protect against high-fat diet-induced cardiometabolic disorders through UA suppression and augmentation of glutathione antioxidant defenses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30445876>GC-MS and LC-MS Identification of the Phenolic Compounds Present in the ethyl Acetate Fraction Obtained from  L.

Knife motion, washing and scratching scenarios were simulated by linear abrasion using knife blades, scrubbing pads and tungsten carbide burr attachments, respectively. Migration was evaluated using water and 3% acetic acid as food simulants. Low concentrations of silver (Ag) were detected in water simulants, a small portion (<4 ng dm) in the form of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with particle number concentrations on the order of 10 particles dm. Median particle diameter was 40 nm.

The gut microbiota has been identified as a potential contributor to metabolic diseases. We evaluate whether these alterations in intestinal microbiota composition produced by H. pylori infection and its posterior eradication with antibiotic treatment could be associated with glucose homeostasis in metabolically healthy subjects.Forty adult patients infected with H. pylori and 20 control subjects were recruited. The infected subjects were evaluated before and two months after eradication treatment (omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin). The microbiota composition in fecal samples was determined by 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4) sequencing using Illumina Miseq.Patients (pre- and post-H. pylori eradication) showed a decreased bacterial richness and diversity with respect to controls. There was an improvement in glucose homeostasis in subjects two months after H. pylori eradication treatment.

Experimental anti-inflammatory therapies have been shown to ameliorate hypertensive end-organ damage. Recently, the CANTOS study (Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study) targeting interleukin-1β demonstrated that anti-inflammatory therapy reduces cardiovascular risk. The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in immune homeostasis and cardiovascular health. Short-chain   (SCFAs) are produced from dietary fiber by gut bacteria and affect host immune homeostasis. Here, we investigated effects of the  propionate in 2 different mouse models of hypertensive cardiovascular damage.To investigate the effect of SCFAs on hypertensive cardiac damage and atherosclerosis, wild-type NMRI or apolipoprotein E knockout-deficient mice received propionate (200 mmol/L) or control in the drinking water. To induce hypertension, wild-type NMRI mice were infused with angiotensin II (1.44 mg·kg·d subcutaneous) for 14 days. To accelerate the development of atherosclerosis, apolipoprotein E knockout mice were infused with angiotensin II (0.72 mg·kg·d subcutaneous) for 28 days. Cardiac damage and atherosclerosis were assessed using histology, echocardiography, in vivo electrophysiology, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. Regulatory T cell depletion using PC61 antibody was used to examine the mode of action of propionate.Propionate significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, vascular dysfunction, and hypertension in both models. Susceptibility to cardiac ventricular arrhythmias was significantly reduced in propionate-treated angiotensin II-infused wild-type NMRI mice. Aortic atherosclerotic lesion area was significantly decreased in propionate-treated apolipoprotein E knockout-deficient mice. Systemic inflammation was mitigated by propionate treatment, quantified as a reduction in splenic effector memory T cell frequencies and splenic T helper 17 cells in both models, and a decrease in local cardiac immune cell infiltration in wild-type NMRI mice. Cardioprotective effects of propionate were abrogated in regulatory T cell-depleted angiotensin II-infused mice, suggesting the effect is regulatory T cell-dependent.Our data emphasize an immune-modulatory role of SCFAs and their importance for cardiovascular health. The data suggest that lifestyle modifications leading to augmented  production could be a beneficial nonpharmacological preventive strategy for patients with hypertensive cardiovascular disease.</p></html>
