<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531187> Suppresses Breast Cancer Metastasis by Targeting GRP78-Mediated Glycolysis and ER Stress Apoptotic Pathway.</a></h2><p>Targeting aberrant metabolism is a promising strategy for inhibiting cancer growth and metastasis. Research is now geared towards investigating the inhibition of glycolysis for anticancer drug development.  (BA) has demonstrated potent anticancer activities in multiple malignancies. However, its regulatory effects on glycolysis and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear. BA inhibited invasion and migration of highly aggressive breast cancer cells. Moreover, BA could suppress aerobic glycolysis of breast cancer cells presenting as a reduction of lactate production, quiescent energy phenotype transition, and downregulation of aerobic glycolysis-related proteins. In this study, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) was also identified as the molecular target of BA in inhibiting aerobic glycolysis. BA treatment led to GRP78 overexpression, and GRP78 knockdown abrogated the inhibitory effect of BA on glycolysis. Further studies demonstrated that overexpressed GRP78 activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor PERK. Subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2 led to the inhibition of -catenin expression, which resulted in the inhibition of c-Myc-mediated glycolysis. Coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that BA interrupted the binding between GRP78 and PERK, thereby initiating the glycolysis inhibition cascade. Finally, the lung  model validated that BA inhibited breast cancer metastasis , as well as suppressed the expression of aerobic glycolysis-related proteins. In conclusion, our study not only provided a promising drug for aerobic glycolysis inhibition but also revealed that GRP78 is a novel molecular link between glycolytic metabolism and ER stress during tumor metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25531780>Glycolytic switch in response to  in non-cancer cells.</a></h2><p>The naturally occurring triterpenoid  (BA) shows pronounced polypharmacology ranging from anti-inflammatory to anti-lipogenic activities. Recent evidence suggests that rather diverse cellular signaling events may be attributed to the same common upstream switch in cellular metabolism. In this study we therefore examined the metabolic changes induced by BA (10 µM) administration, with focus on cellular glucose metabolism. We demonstrate that BA elevates the rates of cellular glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts with concomitant reduction of glucose oxidation. Without eliciting signs of obvious cell death BA leads to compromised mitochondrial function, increased expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1 and 2, and liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-dependent activation AMP-activated protein kinase. AMPK activation accounts for the increased glucose uptake and glycolysis which in turn are indispensable for cell viability upon BA treatment. Overall, we show for the first time a significant impact of BA on cellular bioenergetics which may be a central mediator of the pleiotropic actions of BA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28213701>Ursolic acid-mediated changes in glycolytic pathway promote cytotoxic autophagy and apoptosis in phenotypically different breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Plant-derived pentacyclic triterpenotids with multiple biological activities are considered as promising candidates for cancer therapy and prevention. However, their mechanisms of action are not fully understood. In the present study, we have analyzed the effects of low dose treatment (5-20 µM) of ursolic acid (UA) and  (BA) on breast cancer cells of different receptor status, namely MCF-7 (ER, PR, HER2), MDA-MB-231 (ER, PR, HER2) and SK-BR-3 (ER, PR, HER2). UA-mediated response was more potent than BA-mediated response. Triterpenotids (5-10 µM) caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, an increase in p21 levels and SA-beta-galactosidase staining that was accompanied by oxidative stress and DNA damage. UA (20 µM) also diminished AKT signaling that affected glycolysis as judged by decreased levels of HK2, PKM2, ATP and lactate. UA-induced energy stress activated AMPK that resulted in cytotoxic autophagy and apoptosis. UA-mediated elevation in nitric oxide levels and ATM activation may also account for AMPK activation-mediated cytotoxic response. Moreover, UA-promoted apoptosis was associated with decreased pERK1/2 signals and the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, we have shown for the first time that UA at low micromolar range may promote its anticancer action by targeting glycolysis in phenotypically distinct breast cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28852850>Antimicrobial Mechanism of Oleanolic and Ursolic Acids on Streptococcus mutans UA159.</a></h2><p>Triterpenoid saponin derivatives oleanolic acid (OA) and ursolic acid (UA), but not  (BA), were previously found to have strong antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans. OA and UA inhibited the transcription of genes related to peptidoglycan biosynthesis, thereby preventing bacterial growth. However, it is not clear whether this is the only pathway involved in the antimicrobial activity of these compounds against S. mutans. Therefore, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and microarray analyses to examine the expression of genes related to essential metabolic pathways in S. mutans UA159 following incubation with OA, UA, or BA. An oligonucleotide array consisting of 5363 probes was designed to survey 1928 of the 1963 genes in the genome of S. mutans UA159. Genes that showed >2-fold changes in expression in response to the treatment conditions were annotated, and selected target genes involved in central metabolism were analyzed by qPCR. Microarray analysis confirmed that the gene expression patterns of the OA- and UA-treated cells differed from that of the BA-treated culture, indicating differences in the antimicrobial mechanism. In particular, the expression of pfk and pykF, coding for glycolysis regulatory proteins phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, respectively, were significantly decreased in the OA and UA groups (P < 0.05), as were genes involved in fatty acid and amino acid synthesis. In addition, the microarray analysis confirmed previous qPCR results showing that peptidoglycan synthesis is down-regulated in the OA- and UA-treated groups. OA and UA also appear to decrease the generation of organic acids by S. mutans UA159, which would have an anticaries effect. Overall, these findings suggest that OA and UA affect multiple genes involved in the central metabolism of S. mutans, with inhibition of glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and peptidoglycan synthesis, all contributing to their antimicrobial activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684465> suppresses breast cancer aerobic glycolysis via caveolin-1/NF-κB/c-Myc pathway.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence has suggested that targeting glycolysis may be a promising strategy for cancer treatment.  (BA) is a natural pentacyclic terpene that has been reported to be active in inhibiting various malignancies. Here, we showed that BA could inhibit aerobic glycolysis activity in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 by hampering lactate production, glucose uptake and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), as well as suppressing aerobic glycolysis-related proteins including c-Myc, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) and p-PDK1/PDK1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1). Mechanistic studies validated Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as one of key targets of BA in suppressing aerobic glycolysis, as BA administration resulted in Cav-1 upregulation, whereas silencing Cav-1 abrogated the inhibitory effect of BA on aerobic glycolysis. Further investigations demonstrated that BA suppressed aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells by regulating the Cav-1/NF-κB/c-Myc pathway. More meaningfully, BA significantly inhibited breast cancer growth and glycolytic activity in both the transgenic MMTV-PyVT breast cancer spontaneous model and the zebrafish breast cancer xenotransplantation model without any detectable side effects in vivo. Taken together, our study sheds novel insights into BA as a promising candidate drug for suppressing aerobic glycolysis, highlighting Cav-1 as a potential molecular target of BA and aerobic glycolysis regulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although previous studies have found that certain ingredients of  such as flavonoids can inhibit tumor cell proliferation [e.g. colorectal cancer (CRC)], systematic research on the mechanism underlying anticancer effect of active compounds like triterpenoids (TER) is lacking.  Herein, the concept of "network pharmacology primarily based on active compounds" was applied to explore the anticancer mechanisms of TER extract from  In this regard, potential targets and pathways of glycolysis and glutaminolysis form the basis for the anti-CRC effect of triterpenoids. Network pharmacology was used to predict several key proteins in the metabolic pathways, which were further verified via western blot and metabolomics methods.  Our results showed that the total TER in  remarkably inhibited the proliferation and apoptosis of SW620 cells. The top 4 compounds of TER (viz., -BTA, betulonic acid-BTOA, betulin-BT, and semialactic acid-SA) were confirmed through the detection of UPLC-MS and analysis of cell proliferation assays. Mechanistically, this study revealed that TER plays an anti-CRC role through key targets, such as ENO1, ALDOA, PFKFB3, PKM2, and LDHA, as well as key glycolytic and glutaminolytic pathways.  Collectively, these results have provided new insights into the mechanism underlying anti-CRC effect of triterpenoids extract obtained from , mainly through combination of compositional quantitative analysis, network pharmacology, and experimental verification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772482>Inhibitory ASIC2-mediated calcineurin/NFAT against colorectal cancer by triterpenoids extracted from Rhus chinensis Mill.</a></h2><p>Studies have shown that the etiology and pathogenesis of colorectal cancer are closely related to the tumor microenvironment, and the cancer tissue is still in the state of "energy deficit" and has to promote energy generation through high glycolysis. Rhus chinensis Mill is a Chinese herbal medicine used to treat various types of solid tumors in China. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease group caused by abnormal changes in glucose metabolism resulted in lactic acid production, which remodels acidosis.Although previous studies have shown that the active compounds of Rhus chinensis Mill. can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, whether its triterpenoids could effectively regulate glycolysis involved in CRC have not been systematically investigated.In this study, the extraction of triterpenoids extract from Rhus chinensis Mill. was obtained, and cell viability assay, the percentage of apoptosis for CRC cells were counted, and matrigel invasion assay and production of lactic acid and glucose uptake assay was determined. we further examined the expression of the key glycolytic enzymes and acid-sending ion channel (ASIC) family members of SW620 cells, and some key proteins in the glycolytic pathway were further verified.Notably, triterpenoids (TER) of Rhus chinensis Mill. showed effective anti-proliferative activity and significantly altered protein levels associated with CRC cell survival and glycolysis metabolism. TER could down-regulate the expression of ASIC2, in CRC SW620 cell line. Most importantly, the levels of ASIC2 and calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) were also down-regulated by TER. Furthermore, inhibition of activated the ASIC2-mediated calcineurin/NFAT1 pathway and target gene transcript expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in parallel to reduce, and resulted in the reduced invasion ability by TER treatment.The potential pathways and targets that involved in glycolysis to excert the anti-CRC effects of main compounds in triterpenoids of Rhus chinensis Mill. were predicted by network pharmacology methods. Our findings thus provided rational evidence that inhibition of the ASIC2-induced calcineurin/NFAT pathway by triterpenoids in Rhus chinensis Mill. profoundly suppressed cell growth and invasion in CRC, which target alternative glycolysis in colorectal tumor cells, may be a useful adjuvant therapy in the treatment of colorectal cancer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
