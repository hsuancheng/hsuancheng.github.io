<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172516>Improvement of Human-Oral-Epithelial-  and of Tight Junctions by Micronutrients.</a></h1><p>The oral epithelium represents a major interface between an organism and its external environment. Improving this  at the molecular level can provide an organism added protection from microbial-based diseases.   of the Gie-3B11-human-gingival-epithelial-cell-culture model is enhanced by the micronutrients zinc, quercetin, retinoic acid, and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid, as observed by a concentration-dependent increase in transepithelial electrical resistance and a decrease in transepithelial C-d-mannitol permeability. With this improvement of tight-junction (TJ)-  (reduced leak) comes a pattern of micronutrient-induced changes in TJ claudin abundance that is specific to each individual micronutrient, along with changes in claudin subcellular localization. These micronutrients were effective not only when administered to both cell surfaces simultaneously but also when administered to the apical surface alone, the surface to which the micronutrients would be presented in routine clinical use. The biomedical implications of micronutrient enhancement of the oral-epithelial  are discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515728>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) Attenuates Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, Complement Activation and Cell Death in Brain Endothelial Cells Following OGD/Reperfusion.</a></h1><p>Brain endothelial cells play an important role in maintaining blood flow homeostasis in the brain. Cerebral ischemia is a major cause of endothelial dysfunction which can disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)/reperfusion promote cell death and BBB breakdown in brain endothelial cells. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a biologically active phytoconstituent of the medicinal plant Boswellia serrata, has been shown to be protective against various inflammatory diseases as well as ischemic brain injury. The molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial characteristics of AKBA are poorly understood. We subjected bEND.3 cells to OGD/reperfusion to investigate the protective role of AKBA in this model. We found that AKBA treatment attenuated endothelial cell death and oxidative stress assessed by means of TUNEL assay, cleaved-caspase-3, and dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. Furthermore, OGD downregulated  proteins ZO-1 and Occludin levels, and increased the expressions of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, ICAM-1, and complement C3a receptor (C3aR). We also noticed the increased phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in bEND.3 cells in OGD group. AKBA treatment significantly attenuated expression levels of these inflammatory proteins and prevented the degradation of ZO-1 and Occludin following OGD. In conclusion, AKBA treatment provides protection against endothelial cell dysfunction following OGD by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25955295>Boswellia serrata Preserves Intestinal Epithelial Barrier from Oxidative and  Damage.</a></h1><p>Aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are currently the therapeutic choices in  (IBD), however, with limited remission and often serious side effects. Meanwhile complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is increasing, particularly herbal medicine. Boswellia serrata is a traditional Ayurvedic remedy with anti- properties, of interest for its usefulness in IBDs. The mechanism of this pharmacological potential of Boswellia serrata was investigated in colonic epithelial cell monolayers exposed to H2O2 or INF-γ+TNF-α, chosen as in vitro experimental model of intestinal inflammation. The barrier function was evaluated by the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and paracellular permeability assay, and by the tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, ZO-1 and occludin) immunofluorescence. The expression of phosphorylated NF-κB and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were determined by immunoblot and cytofluorimetric assay, respectively. Boswellia serrata oleo-gum extract (BSE) and its pure derivative acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), were tested at 0.1-10 μg/ml and 0.027 μg/ml, respectively. BSE and AKBA safety was demonstrated by no alteration of intestinal cell viability and barrier function and integrity biomarkers. H2O2 or INF-γ+TNF-α treatment of Caco-2 cell monolayers significantly reduced TEER, increased paracellular permeability and caused the disassembly of tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1. BSE and AKBA pretreatment significantly prevented functional and morphological alterations and also the NF-κB phosphorylation induced by the  stimuli. At the same concentrations BSE and AKBA counteracted the increase of ROS caused by H2O2 exposure. Data showed the positive correlation of the antioxidant activity with the mechanism involved in the physiologic maintenance of the integrity and function of the intestinal epithelium. This study elucidates the pharmacological mechanisms mediated by BSE, in protecting intestinal epithelial barrier from  damage and supports its use as safe adjuvant in patients affected by IBD.</p></html>
