<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23487168>A systematic comparison of the properties of clinically used angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (ARBs) have become an important drug class in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure and the protection from diabetic nephropathy. Eight ARBs are clinically available [azilsartan, candesartan, eprosartan, , losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan]. Azilsartan (in some countries), candesartan, and olmesartan are orally administered as prodrugs, whereas the blocking action of some is mediated through active metabolites. On the basis of their chemical structures, ARBs use different binding pockets in the receptor, which are associated with differences in dissociation times and, in most cases, apparently insurmountable antagonism. The physicochemical differences between ARBs also manifest in different tissue penetration, including passage through the blood-brain . Differences in binding mode and tissue penetration are also associated with differences in pharmacokinetic profile, particularly duration of action. Although generally highly specific for angiotensin II type 1 receptors, some ARBs, particularly telmisartan, are partial agonists at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. All of these properties are comprehensively reviewed in this article. Although there is general consensus that a continuous receptor blockade over a 24-hour period is desirable, the clinical relevance of other pharmacological differences between individual ARBs remains to be assessed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28733707>Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers Inhibit KAT II Activity in the Brain-Its Possible Clinical Applications.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are one of the most frequently recommended antihypertensive drugs. Apart from their activity towards the circulatory system, ARBs also penetrate the blood-brain  and display neuroprotective effects. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an endogenous metabolite of tryptophan produced by kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II) in the brain. Antagonism towards all ionotropic glutamate (GLU) receptors is the main mechanism of KYNA action. An elevated brain level of KYNA is linked with memory impairment and psychotic symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of three ARBs: , losartan, and telmisartan on KYNA production and KAT II activity in rat brain. The effect of ARBs on KYNA production was analyzed in rat brain cortical slices and on isolated KAT II enzyme. , losartan, and telmisartan decreased KYNA production and KAT II activity in a dose-dependent manner in rat brain cortex in vitro. Molecular docking suggested that the examined ARBs could bind to an active site of KAT II. In conclusion, ARBs decrease KYNA production in rat brain by direct inhibition of KAT II enzymatic activity. This novel mechanism of ARBs action may be advantageous in the treatment of cognitive impairment or the management of schizophrenia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20007350>Comparative effect of direct renin inhibition and AT1R blockade on glomerular filtration  injury in the transgenic Ren2 rat.</a></h2><p>Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation contributes to kidney injury through oxidative stress. Renin is the rate-limiting step in angiotensin (ANG II) generation. Recent work suggests renin inhibition improves proteinuria comparable to ANG type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockade (ARB). Thereby, we investigated the relative impact of treatment with a renin inhibitor vs. an ARB on renal oxidative stress and associated glomerular structural and functional changes in the transgenic Ren2 rat, which manifests hypertension, albuminuria, and increased tissue RAS activity. Young Ren2 and age-matched Sprague-Dawley (SD) controls (age 6-9 wk) were treated with a renin inhibitor (aliskiren), an ARB (), or vehicle for 21 days. Ren2 rats exhibited increases in systolic pressure (SBP), albuminuria, and renal 3-nitrotyrosine content as well as ultrastructural podocyte foot-process effacement and diminution of the podocyte-specific protein nephrin. Structural and functional alterations were accompanied by increased renal cortical ANG II, AT1R, as well as NADPH oxidase subunit (Nox2) expression compared with SD controls. Abnormalities were attenuated to a similar extent with both aliskiren and  treatment. Despite the fact the dose of  used caused a greater reduction in SBP than aliskerin treatment (P < 0.05), the effects on proteinuria, nephrin, and oxidative stress were similar between the two treatments. Our results highlight both the importance of pressor-related reductions on podocyte integrity and albuminuria as well as RAS-mediated oxidant stress largely comparable between ARB and renin inhibition treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23743807>Urinary renin and angiotensinogen in type 2 diabetes: added value beyond urinary albumin?</a></h2><p>Urinary levels of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) components may reflect renal RAAS activity and/or the renal efficacy of RAAS inhibition. Our aim was to determine whether urinary angiotensinogen and renin are circulating RAAS-independent markers during RAAS blockade.Urinary and plasma levels of angiotensinogen, renin, and albumin were measured in 22 patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria, during 2-month treatment periods with placebo, aliskiren, , or their combination in random order in a crossover study.Aliskiren and  both increased plasma renin 3-4-fold, and above 10-fold when combined.  decreased plasma angiotensinogen by approximately 25%, and no changes in plasma angiotensinogen were observed during the combination. Urine contained aliskiren at micromolar levels, blocking urinary renin by above 90%. Both blockers reduced urinary angiotensinogen, significant for  only. Combination blockade reduced urinary angiotensinogen even further. Reductions in urinary angiotensinogen paralleled albuminuria changes, and the urine/plasma concentration ratio of angiotensinogen was identical to that of albumin under all conditions. In contrast, urinary renin did not follow albumin, and remained unaltered after all treatments. Yet, the urine/plasma concentration ratio of renin was more than 100-fold higher than that of angiotensinogen and albumin, and approximately 4-fold reduced by single RAAS blockade, and more than 10-fold by dual RAAS blockade.Aliskiren filters into urine and influences urinary renin measurements. The urine/plasma renin ratio, but not urinary renin alone, may reflect the renal efficacy of RAAS blockade. Urinary angiotensinogen is a marker of filtration  damage rather than intrarenal RAAS activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28669009>Neuroprotective effects of AT1 receptor antagonists after experimental ischemic stroke: what is important?</a></h2><p>The present study conducted in rats defines the requirements for neuroprotective effects of systemically administered AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) in acute ischaemic stroke. The inhibition of central effects to angiotensin II (ANG II) after intravenous (i.v.) treatment with candesartan (0.3 and 3 mg/kg) or  and losartan (3 and 30 mg/kg) was employed to study the penetration of these ARBs across the blood-brain . Verapamil and probenecid were used to assess the role of the transporters, P-glycoprotein and the multidrug resistance-related protein 2, in the entry of losartan and  into the brain. Neuroprotective effects of i.v. treatment with the ARBs were investigated after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min. The treatment with the ARBs was initiated 3 h after the onset of MCAO and continued for two consecutive days. Blood pressure was continuously recorded before and during MCAO until 5.5 h after the onset of reperfusion. The higher dose of candesartan completely abolished, and the lower dose of candesartan and higher doses of  and losartan partially inhibited the drinking response to intracerebroventricular ANG II. Only 0.3 mg/kg candesartan improved the recovery from ischaemic stroke, and 3 mg/kg candesartan did not exert neuroprotective effects due to marked blood pressure reduction during reperfusion. Both doses of  and losartan had not any effect on the stroke outcome. An effective, long-lasting blockade of brain AT1 receptors after systemic treatment with ARBs without extensive blood pressure reductions is the prerequisite for neuroprotective effects in ischaemic stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23949470>Angiotensin-(1-7) protects from experimental acute lung injury.</a></h2><p>Recently, recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was shown to protect mice from acute lung injury, an effect attributed to reduced bioavailability of angiotensin II. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 metabolizes angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7), we hypothesized that this effect is alternatively mediated by angiotensin-(1-7) and activation of its receptor(s).To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of intravenously infused angiotensin-(1-7) in three experimental models of acute lung injury.Animal research laboratory.Male Sprague-Dawley rats, Balb/c mice, and C57Bl6/J mice.Angiotensin-(1-7) was administered with ventilator- or acid aspiration-induced lung injury in mice or 30 minutes after oleic acid infusion in rats. In vitro, the effect of angiotensin-(1-7) on transendothelial electrical resistance of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells was analyzed.Infusion of angiotensin-(1-7) starting 30 minutes after oleic acid administration protected rats from acute lung injury as evident by reduced lung edema, myeloperoxidase activity, histological lung injury score, and pulmonary vascular resistance while systemic arterial pressure was stabilized. Such effects were largely reproduced by the nonpeptidic angiotensin-(1-7) analog AVE0991. Infusion of angiotensin-(1-7) was equally protective in murine models of ventilator- or acid aspiration-induced lung injury. In the oleic acid model, the two distinct angiotensin-(1-7) receptor blockers A779 and D-Pro-angiotensin-(1-7) reversed the normalizing effects of angiotensin-(1-7) on systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics, but only D-Pro-angiotensin-(1-7) blocked the protection from lung edema and protein leak, whereas A779 restored the infiltration of neutrophils. Rats were also protected from acute lung injury by the AT1 antagonist ; however, this effect was again blocked by A779 and D-Pro-angiotensin-(1-7). In vitro, angiotensin-(1-7) protected pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells from thrombin-induced  failure, yet D-Pro-angiotensin-(1-7) or NO synthase inhibition blocked this effect.Angiotensin-(1-7) or its analogs attenuate the key features of acute lung injury and may present a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11508272> normalises the deficiency in glomerular nephrin expression in a model of diabetes and hypertension.</a></h2><p>The location of nephrin has been identified as the slit-diaphragm of the glomerular podocyte. Recent evidence suggests that nephrin could play a key role in the  of the glomerular filtration  and the development of proteinuria but its status in long-term diabetes is still not understood. We studied the expression of nephrin in a hypertensive model of diabetic nephropathy and investigated the potential influence of angiotensin II blockade on nephrin gene and protein expression.Streptozotocin-diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats were given either no treatment or the angiotensin II antagonist, , at a dose of 15 mg/kg per day by gavage for 32 weeks. Non-diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats were used as a control group. Real time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to assess and quantify gene and protein expression of nephrin.Diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats developed albuminuria and had a reduction in both gene and protein expression of nephrin when compared with control rats.  treatment prevented the development of albuminuria and completely abrogated the down regulation of nephrin in diabetic rats.Long-term diabetes in spontaneously hypertensive rats is associated with a reduction in both gene and protein expression of nephrin within the kidney. These changes in nephrin levels were completely prevented by angiotensin II antagonist treatment, suggesting a potential novel mechanism to explain the antiproteinuric effect of agents which interrupt the renin-angiotensin system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27643439>Angiotensin receptors and β-catenin regulate brain endothelial integrity in malaria.</a></h2><p>Cerebral malaria is characterized by cytoadhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (Pf-iRBCs) to endothelial cells in the brain, disruption of the blood-brain , and cerebral microhemorrhages. No available antimalarial drugs specifically target the endothelial disruptions underlying this complication, which is responsible for the majority of malaria-associated deaths. Here, we have demonstrated that ruptured Pf-iRBCs induce activation of β-catenin, leading to disruption of inter-endothelial cell junctions in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). Inhibition of β-catenin-induced TCF/LEF transcription in the nucleus of HBMECs prevented the disruption of endothelial junctions, confirming that β-catenin is a key mediator of P. falciparum adverse effects on endothelial integrity. Blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) or stimulation of the type 2 receptor (AT2) abrogated Pf-iRBC-induced activation of β-catenin and prevented the disruption of HBMEC monolayers. In a mouse model of cerebral malaria, modulation of angiotensin II receptors produced similar effects, leading to protection against cerebral malaria, reduced cerebral hemorrhages, and increased survival. In contrast, AT2-deficient mice were more susceptible to cerebral malaria. The interrelation of the β-catenin and the angiotensin II signaling pathways opens immediate host-targeted therapeutic possibilities for cerebral malaria and other diseases in which brain endothelial integrity is compromised.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16321381>Effects of losartan and  administration on brain angiotensinogen mRNA levels.</a></h2><p>Losartan, 2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[(2'(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-biphenil-4-yl)methyl]imidazole, and , 2-n-butyl-3-[(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-1,3-diaza-spiro[4,4]non-1-en-4-one, are two angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists largely used in human health care as antihypertensive agents. Their ability to cross the blood-brain  and to influence the central renin-angiotensin system are widely investigated, but how this brain system responds to the subchronic and chronic block of the angiotensin AT1 receptor is still unknown. Normotensive rats were intragastrically implanted for 7- and 30-day administration, with a dose of 3 and 30 mg/kg body weight. Treatments were shown to influence, in a dose-, time- and brain-area-dependent manner, angiotensinogen mRNA levels in scanned areas. This study showed a general up-regulation of angiotensinogen mRNA expression after 7 days and a widespread down-regulation or basal level of expression after a 30-day administration of two angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22490812>[Triptolide combined with  synergistically blocks podocyte injury in a type 2 diabetes rat model].</a></h2><p>To investigate the protective effect of combination of triptolide and  on the podocytes in a type 2 diabetic(T2DM) rat model, and evaluate its mechanism.T2DM rats were induced by fed with high-sucrose-high-fat diet combined with a low dose of streptozocin. The rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: normal control group (NC, n = 10), diabetes group (DM, n = 11), triptolide treatment group (DT, n = 12),  treatment group (DI, n = 12) and triptolide combined with  treatment group (DTI, n = 13). Ultrastructure of podocytes was observed by electronic microscopy and urinary albumin (UAL) excretion by ELISA was determined after 8 weeks. The expression of nephrin and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)β(1) mRNA and proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and Western blot.Increased UAL was significantly attenuated in all treatment groups. Compared to NC group, UAL in DM group was increased significantly (0.45 ± 0.09 vs 6.36 ± 0.87, P < 0.01), while decreased in triptolide or  alone treatment group (2.48 ± 0.37 and 2.68 ± 0.42, both P < 0.01). Compared with those in control groups, kidney expression of nephrin, BMP-7 mRNA and proteins were downregulated while CTGF, TGFβ(1) mRNA and proteins were significantly upregulated in T2DM rats. Triptolide or  each alone moderately ameliorated albuminuria and podocyte damage. However, their combined usage showed a dramatic therapeutic synergism, manifested by prevention of progressive albuminuria, restoration of the glomerular filtration , reversal of the decline in slit diaphragm proteins, reduction expression of CTGF, TGFβ(1), and upregulation of BMP-7.Our findings show that triptolide can increase the efficacy of , leading to a more effective prevention of kidney disease in T2DM rat model, which may through upregulation of BMP-7 and inhibition the over-expression of CTGF and TGFβ(1).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9718262>Evaluation of the ability of  to cross the blood-brain  following acute intragastric treatment.</a></h2><p>The present study evaluated in functional tests the ability of the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist , 2-n-butyl-3-[(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-1,3-d iaza-spiro[4,4]non-1-en-4-one, in comparison to losartan, 2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[(2'(1H-tetrazol-5-yl) bi-phenyl-4-yl)methyl]imidazole, to cross the blood-brain  following acute intragastric administration. Two tests were used: the dipsogenic response to intracerebroventricular injection of angiotensin II, and Na+ intake in response to adrenalectomy. In normotensive rats,  reduced the dipsogenic response to angiotensin II, 10 pmol per rat, at the dose of 90 mg/kg, but not at lower doses. Losartan significantly reduced angiotensin II-induced drinking at 30 mg/kg, but not at a lower dose. In spontaneously hypertensive rats,  reduced the response to angiotensin II at 50 mg/kg, but not at lower doses, while losartan significantly inhibited angiotensin II-induced drinking even at 10 mg/kg. In adrenalectomized rats, the intake of 2% NaCl was inhibited by the intragastric administration of losartan 30 or 50 mg/kg, while  did not reduce it in doses up to 50 mg/kg. The results of the present study consistently indicate that after acute intragastric administration, the ability of  to cross the blood-brain  is lower than that of losartan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8738798>Angiotensin II modulates glomerular capillary permselectivity in rat isolated perfused kidney.</a></h2><p>Studies in experimental animals and humans have documented that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduces urinary protein excretion rate and retards the development of renal injury. Here we sought to investigate whether angiotensin II (All) modified the size-selective properties to macromolecules of the glomerular capillary  in isolated perfused rat kidney preparation. Compared with basal values, continuous All infusion into the renal artery at the rate of 3 or 8 ng/min, but not at 0.6 ng/min, induced a progressive and significant increase in urinary protein excretion rate. Evaluation of the sieving properties of the glomerular  by fractional clearance of polydisperse Ficoll showed that All significantly enhanced the filtration of tracer molecules of radil > or = 34A. All-induced changes in urinary protein excretion rate and in Ficoll fractional clearance were completely prevented by pretreatment with the specific All Type 1 receptor antagonist SR 47436.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26108068>Renin-angiotensin blockade resets podocyte epigenome through Kruppel-like Factor 4 and attenuates proteinuria.</a></h2><p>Proteinuria is a central component of chronic kidney disease and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Kidney podocytes have an essential role as a filtration  against proteinuria. Kruppel-like Factor 4 (KLF4) is expressed in podocytes and decreased in glomerular diseases leading to methylation of the nephrin promoter, decreased nephrin expression and proteinuria. Treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) reduced methylation of the nephrin promoter in murine glomeruli of an adriamycin nephropathy model with recovery of KLF4 expression and a decrease in albuminuria. In podocyte-specific KLF4 knockout mice, the effect of ARB on albuminuria and the nephrin promoter methylation was attenuated. In cultured human podocytes, angiotensin II reduced KLF4 expression and caused methylation of the nephrin promoter with decreased nephrin expression. In patients, nephrin promoter methylation was increased in proteinuric kidney diseases with decreased KLF4 and nephrin expression. KLF4 expression in ARB-treated patients was higher in patients with than without ARB treatment. Thus, angiotensin II can modulate epigenetic regulation in podocytes and ARB inhibits these actions in part via KLF4 in proteinuric kidney diseases. This study provides a new concept that renin-angiotensin system blockade can exert therapeutic effects through epigenetic modulation of the kidney gene expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14965311>Efforts to understand the molecular basis of hypertension through drug:membrane interactions.</a></h2><p>Biological membranes play an essential role in the drug action.

Clinically, this process can be recognized as "cotton-wool" spots of the retina or by testing the urine for the presence of albumin. The appearance of albumin in the urine is pathologic and should be evaluated within the context of the accompanying cardiovascular risk.Albumin transition is indicative of a disturbance of the   of endothelial cells. In the kidney, damage to podocytes, mesangial and endothelial cells, a loss of charge selectivity, and an altered expression of matrix proteins can be observed. However, vascular alterations are not confined to the kidney but can also be observed in the myocardium. Even though thresholds for microalbuminuria (> 30 mg/24 h) and proteinuria (> 300 mg/24 h) have been arbitrarily defined, an increase in risk starts at much lower levels of albumin excretion.The prevalence of microalbuminuria in the general population is about 8%. However, prevalence rates of > 50% have been observed in high-risk groups, which are accompanied by an increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.A number of therapeutic options (tight blood sugar control, blood pressure reduction, lipid lowering) lead to a reduction of albuminuria and an improvement in cardiovascular prognosis. This has particularly been described for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-(RAAS-)blocking agents. Their use is not only associated with a reduced risk of end-organ damage (heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, cerebrovascular events) but has been described to decrease mortality as well.A timely diagnosis, a consecutive cardiovascular diagnostic work-up and the subsequent use of RAAS-blocking agents is indicated in patients in whom albuminuria has been diagnosed.</p></html>
