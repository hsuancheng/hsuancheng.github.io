In this study, (3β, 25R)‑spirost‑5‑en‑3‑oxyl (2‑((2((2‑aminoethyl)amino)ethyl)amino)ethyl) carbamate (DGP), a new synthetic  derivative incorporating primary amine was used to investigate its anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of action in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. Pretreatment with DGP resulted in significant inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, and down-regulation of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. In addition, DGP decreased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). The inhibitory effects of DGP on these inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells were regulated by NF-κB signaling through blocking p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB p65/DNA binding activity. DGP also blocked the phosphorylation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). The NF-κB inhibitor JSH-23 and JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 significantly decreased NO production and IL-6 release in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, respectively. The overall results demonstrate that DGP has anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-stimulated BV2 cells via inhibition of NF-κB and JNK activation, suggesting that DGP is a potential prophylactic agent in various neurodegenerative disorders.Copyright © 2018.

The  at two dose levels, namely 100 and 200mgkg(-1), was intragastrically administrated once daily for 7-day period prior to the surgery. Then, the rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using the intraluminal thread for 90min. After 24h reperfusion, several diagnostic indicators were evaluated and all animals were sacrificed to harvest their brains and blood for subsequent biochemical analyses. The results indicated that  treatment significantly inhibited the death rate and improved the impaired neurological functions along with neurological deficit scores and cerebral infarct size as compared with the rats exposed to I/R insult without agents administration. The increase in the number of apoptotic cells determined by TUNEL in the hippocampus CA1 and cortex was also apparently attenuated in the  treatment group, which was closely correlated with suppression of Caspase-3 activity and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In addition the elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in blood serum of the I/R treated rats were reduced almost to their normal level. Further results obtained from the Western blotting analysis revealed that the protein expression of IκBα in the injured brain was up-regulated, while the p65 subunit of NF-κB was down-regulated in nucleus after the treatment. Collectively, this neuroprotection of  against I/R injury may be attained through its anti-apoptosis, anti- and intervening the NF-κB signal pathway properties. Due to the satisfactory findings,  might be a powerful therapeutic agent to combat the similar disease in future clinic.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We found that Dios suppressed the synthesis of molecules that promote  (M1 markers, such as NO, IL-6, and TNF-α) in rat microglia and BV-2 cells induced with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In contrast, Dios had no effects on the cellular production of anti-inflammatory factors (M2 markers, such as IL-10, IL-1Rα and CD206) in LPS and IL-4 treated microglia. Dios repressed IκB-α, ERK MAPK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, but did not affect JNK in LPS-activated microglia. We also found that conditioned medium obtained from cultures of BV-2 cells incubated with Dios plus LPS was markedly less neurotoxic than conditioned medium obtained from cultures of BV-2 cells incubated with LPS alone. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that Dios can selectively suppress the production/expression of pro-inflammatory M1 markers by activated microglia, without affecting M2 markers, and might provide neuroprotection by regulating microglial M1 polarization. Our results suggest that Dios can be used in treatment of various neuroinflammatory diseases mediated by microglia.Copyright © 2017.

However, the specific mechanism by which this is achieved is not clear. This study investigated the protective effects of  on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and the potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS Healthy adult male SD rats, body weight (b.w.) 250-280 g, were used to model ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and were administered  (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg b.w.) intragastrically for 4 consecutive weeks before surgery. The left anterior descending artery (LAD) was ligated to induce myocardial ischemia for 30 min and reperfusion for 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min while relevant indicators were detected. RESULTS Both 50 mg and 100 mg  oral administration increased left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and maximum changing rate of ventricular pressure (±dp/dtmax), decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and myocardial enzyme markers.

There are few effective drugs that can delay the progression of this disease; thus, patients with silicosis are usually only offered supportive care. Dioscin, a steroidal saponin, exhibits many biological activities and health benefits including its protective effects against hepatic fibrosis. However, the effect of dioscin on silicosis is unknown.We employed experimental mouse mode of silicosis. Different doses of dioscin were gavaged to the animals 1 day after crystalline silica instillation to see the effect of dioscin on crystalline silica induced pulmonary fibrosis. Also, we used RAW264.7 and NIH-3T3 cell lines to explore dioscin effects on macrophages and fibroblasts. Dioscin was also oral treatment but 10 days after crystalline silica instillation to see its effect on established pulmonary fibrosis.Dioscin treatment reduced pro- and pro-fibrotic cytokine secretion by modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. It also reduced the recruitment of fibrocytes, protected epithelial cells from crystalline silica injury, inhibited transforming growth factor beta/Smad3 signaling and fibroblast activation. Together, these effects delayed the progression of crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The mechanism by which dioscin treatment alleviated CS-induced  appeared to be via the reduction of macrophage, B lymphocyte, and T lymphocte infiltration into lung. Dioscin inhibits macrophages and fibroblasts from secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and may also function as a modulator of T helper cells responses, concurrent with attenuated phosphorylation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1-p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. Also, dioscin could block the phosphorylation of Smad3 in fibroblast. Oral treatment of dioscin could also effectively postpone the progression of established silicosis.Oral treatment dioscin delays crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis and exerts pulmonary protective effects in mice. Dioscin may be a novel and potent candidate for protection against crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454535>Bivalent furostene carbamates as antiproliferative and antiinflammatory agents.</a></h1><p>Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women affecting about 12% of world's female population.

In this work, an in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model and an in vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model were used. The results indicated that dioscin clearly protected PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons against OGD/R insult and significantly prevented cerebral I/R injury. Further research demonstrated that dioscin-induced neuroprotection was accompanied by a significant inhibition in the expression and the nuclear to cytosolic translocation of HMGB-1, reflected by decreased TLR4 expression. Blockade of the TLR4/MyD88/TRAF6 signaling pathway by dioscin inhibited NF-κB and AP-1 transcriptional activities, MAPK and STAT3 phosphorylation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, and upregulated the levels of anti-inflammatory factors. In addition, small interfering RNA (siRNA) and overexpressed genes of HMGB-1 and TLR4 were applied in in vitro experiments, respectively, and the results further confirmed that dioscin showed an efficient neuroprotection because of its inhibiting effects on HMGB-1/TLR4 signaling and subsequent suppressing .

In the present work, liver injury in mice and rats was induced by LPS, and dioscin was intragastrically administered for 7days. In vitro, the AML-12 cells and HepG-2 cells were treated with LPS after dioscin treatment. The results showed that dioscin not only markedly reduced serum ALT, AST levels and relative liver weights, but also restored cell injury caused by LPS. In mechanism study, dioscin significantly attenuated  through down-regulating the levels of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), phosphorylated inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase (p-IKK), phosphorylated inhibitor of nuclear factor κB alpha (p-IκBα), phosphorylated nuclear factor κB p65 (p-NF-κB p65), high-mobility group protein 1 (HMGB-1), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). TLR4 overexpression was also decreased by dioscin, leading to the markedly decreased levels of MyD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, p-IKK, p-IκBα, p-NF-κB p65 and HMGB-1. Suppression of MyD88 by ST2825 eliminated the inhibitory effects of dioscin on the levels of IRAK1, TRAF6, p-IKK, p-IκBα, p-NF-κB p65, HMGB-1, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α.

Then, the corresponding gene information of the obtained drug-targets was applied to predict the related biological activities, signal pathways and processes networks of the compound by using MetaCore platform. After that, some most relevant regulating networks were considered, which included the nodes and relevant pathways of dioscin.71 potential targets of dioscin from humans, 7 from rats and 8 from mice were screened, and the prediction results showed that the most likely targets of dioscin were cyclin A2, calmodulin, hemoglobin subunit beta, DNA topoisomerase I, DNA polymerase lambda, nitric oxide synthase and UDP-N-acetylhexosamine pyrophosphorylase, etc. Many diseases including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis of human, temporal lobe epilepsy of rat and ankylosing spondylitis of mouse, may be inhibited by dioscin through regulating immune response alternative complement pathway, G-protein signaling RhoB regulation pathway and immune response antiviral actions of interferons, etc. The most relevant networks (5 from human, 3 from rat and 5 from mouse) indicated that dioscin may be a TOP1 inhibitor, which can treat cancer though the cell cycle- transition and termination of DNA replication pathway.

Because current acne medications have various side effects, it is necessary to explore alternative medications possessing anti-inflammatory activity against P. acnes. We investigated the inhibitory effects of polyphyllin I (PPI) on P. acnes-induced  in vitro. In this study, we examined the effects of PPI on the production of inflammatory cytokines in HaCaT keratinocytes treated with heat-killed P. acnes. These treated HaCaT keratinocytes showed increased expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and production of inflammatory cytokines. PPI significantly suppressed the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and the expression of TLR2 in P. acnes-treated cells. Moreover, we studied the influence of PPI on the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in P. acnes-treated keratinocytes. PPI diminished the activation of NF-κB. Phosphorylated p38 levels were markedly increased after treatment with heat-killed P. acnes but were decreased after treatment with PPI, while the effect of PPI on ERK phosphorylation was not significant. Heat-killed P. acnes and PPI did not have any effect on JNK phosphorylation. Furthermore, we confirmed that NF-κB p65 inhibitor (BAY11-7082), p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580), and PPI blocked the expression of IL-8 in heat-killed P. acnes-treated cells.

The rats were preconditioned with protodioscin at the doses of 25 and 50mgkg(-1) prior to surgery. Then the animals were subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using an intraluminal method by inserting a thread (90min surgery). After the blood flow was restored in 24h via withdrawing the thread, some representative indicators for the cerebral injury were evaluated by various methods including TTC-staining, TUNEL, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting. As compared with the operated rats without drug intervening, treatment with protodioscin apparently lowered the death rate and improved motor coordination abilities through reducing the deficit scores and cerebral infarct volume. What's more, an apparent decrease in neuron apoptosis detected in hippocampus CA1 and cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere might attribute to alleviate the increase in Caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Meanwhile, concentrations of several main pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) in the serum were also significantly suppressed. Finally, the NF-κB and IκBa protein expressions in the cytoplasm of right injured brain were remarkably up-regulated, while NF-κB in nucleus was down-regulated. Therefore, these observed findings demonstrated that protodioscin appeared to reveal potential neuroprotection against the I/R injury due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis properties.

The present study investigated whether dioscin may exert protective effects against CHD‑induced heart apoptosis, oxidative stress and  in a pig model and the potential underlying mechanisms. Adult pigs were used to establish a CHD model group and 80 mg/kg dioscin was administered for 4 weeks. Histological analysis and measurement of serum levels of heart injury markers demonstrated that 80 mg/kg dioscin markedly alleviated CHD, while left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular systolic internal diameter measurements indicated that 80 mg/kg dioscin also increased heart function in the CHD pig model. Furthermore, western blotting demonstrated that 80 mg/kg dioscin significantly reduced protein levels of apoptosis markers in the heart of CHD model pigs, including Bcl‑2‑associated X and caspase‑3, potentially via the suppression of poly (ADP‑ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP)/p53 expression. Additionally, the results of ELISA and western blotting demonstrated that 80 mg/kg dioscin may reduce oxidative stress and  in CHD model pigs through the promotion of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2) protein expression and the suppression of PARP/p53 and p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression.

This anticontractile effect of PVAT is lost under conditions of obesity. The central mechanism underlying this PVAT dysfunction in obesity is likely to be an 'obesity triad' (consisting of PVAT hypoxia,  and oxidative stress) that leads to the impairment of PVAT-derived vasoregulators. The production of hydrogen sulfide, NO and adiponectin by PVAT is reduced in obesity, whereas the vasodilator response to leptin is impaired (vascular leptin resistance). Strikingly, the vasodilator response to acetylcholine is reduced only in PVAT-containing, but not in PVAT-free thoracic aorta isolated from diet-induced obese mice, indicating a unique role for PVAT in obesity-induced vascular dysfunction. Furthermore, PVAT dysfunction has also been observed in small arteries isolated from the gluteal/visceral fat biopsy samples of obese individuals. Therefore, PVAT may represent a new therapeutic target for vascular complications in obesity. A number of approaches are currently being tested under experimental conditions. Potential therapeutic strategies improving PVAT function include body weight reduction, enhancing PVAT hydrogen sulfide release (e.g. rosiglitazone, atorvastatin and cannabinoid CB receptor agonists) and NO production (e.g. arginase inhibitors), inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, inhibition of  with melatonin or cytokine antagonists, activators of AMP-activated kinase (e.g. metformin, resveratrol and ) and adiponectin releasers or expression enhancers.This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

JNK knockdown using siRNA prevented the α-chaconine-mediated inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators. In a sepsis model, pretreatment with α-chaconine reduced the LPS-induced lethality and the mRNA and production levels of pro-inflammatory mediators by inhibiting c-Jun activation. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of α-chaconine are associated with the suppression of AP-1, and support its possible therapeutic role for the treatment of sepsis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Searching for compounds that are as equally efficient as glucocorticoids, but with less side effects, the current study compared plant steroids, namely, glycyrrhetinic acid, guggulsterone, boswellic acid, withaferin A, and  with the classical glucocorticoid, fluticasone. This was approached both  using molecular docking against glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and  in two different animal models. All tested compounds interacted with GR, but only boswellic acid and withaferin A showed docking results comparable to fluticasone, as well as similar  anti-inflammatory effects, by significantly decreasing serum levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor- in cotton pellet-induced granuloma in rats. In addition, both compounds significantly decreased the percent of change in ear weight in croton oil-induced ear edema in mice and the granuloma weight in cotton pellet-induced granuloma in rats, to levels comparable to that of fluticasone.

The main constituent of DT is black tea originating from Camellia sinensis that is supplemented by 12 other medicinal plants. Black tea contains a large amount of the flavonoids catechins especially epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative capacity. This study was undertaken to evaluate the possible effects of DT intake on inflammatory cytokines, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and metabolic biomarkers in T2DM.The study included 50 patients with T2DM. The patients had received 3 cups (600ml) of DT extract or placebo (PL) extract per day during a period of 12 weeks. Intracellular cytokine expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) as well as the glycemic and lipid profiles were measured at baseline and after the treatment period. The active constituents of the medicinal plants included in DT were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS).Ingestion of DT suppressed CD4+ T cell expression of IL-1β and Il-8 (p<0.05) and up-regulated the expression of IL-10 and the Treg/IL-17 ratio (p<0.05) which was not shown in PL. A significant decrease in HbA1c and LDL was observed at the end of the study period (p<0.05) in DT. The GC/MS analyses of DT indicated the presence of lupeol, β-Amyrin and β-sitosterol. Also analyses of individual herbs showed the presence of higher levels of lupeol and β-Amyrin in Nuga Ficus bengalensis and β-sitosterol in the Attikka Ficus racemosa, indicating that the active ingredients of DT are concentrated in these two herbs.The present study provides evidence that DT has hypoglycemic and antihyperlipidemic properties. Interestingly, DT has anti-inflammatory effects. These properties are attributed to the flavonoids, triterpenes and phytosterol contents of the tea. We suggest that DT protects against diabetes complications in the long term.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this paper, the results indicated that dioscin significantly increased cell viability, and inhibited  and apoptosis caused by hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injury in IEC-6 cells. in vivo II/R injury, dioscin markedly suppressed inflamma- tion and apoptosis, improved pathological changes, and depressed chiu' score in rats. Mechanistic studies indicated that dioscin notably up-regulated the expression level of MAPK13 through decreasing miR-351-5p level, and thereby decreased the expression levels of p-PKD1, NF-κB, Apaf-1, cleaved Caspase-3 and cleaved Caspase-9. Furthermore, miR-351-5p mimic and inhibitor experiments in IEC-6 cells further proved that dioscin up-regulated MAPK13 expression by decreasing miR-351-5p level to inhibit  and apoptosis. Therefore, dioscin showed protective effect against II/R injury via adjusting miR-351-5/MAPK13-mediated  and apoptosis. Dioscin should be considered as one potent candidate and miR-351-5/ MAPK13 should be one effective drug target for the treatment of II/R injury.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the effect of dioscin on thioacetamide (TAA)-induced acute liver injury still remained unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether dioscin confers a protective effect against TAA-induced acute liver injury in rats and mice. The results showed that dioscin decreased the serum levels of ALT, AST, and rehabilitated histopathological changes compared with the model groups. In addition, dioscin obviously increased the levels of GSH, GSH-Px, SOD, and significantly reduced MDA levels compared with the model groups. Mechanistic study showed that dioscin significantly up-regulated the expression levels of FXR, p-AMPKα, and then increased the expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO-1, GCLM and GST. Furthermore, dioscin obviously down-regulated the expression levels of NF-κB (p65), ICAM-1, HMGB1, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Taken together, dioscin showed protective effect against TAA-induced acute liver injuries in rats and mice and the effects might be obtained through inhibiting oxidative stress and  via FXR/AMPK signal pathway. These findings provided a new insight on the role of doscin in the treatment of acute liver injury.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In vivo liver fibrosis in mice was induced by an alcoholic liquid diet, and in vitro studies were performed on activated HSC-T6 and LX2 cells treated with lipopolysaccharide. Our results showed that dioscin significantly attenuated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation, improved collagen accumulation, and attenuated  through down-regulating the levels of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α by decreasing Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 expression both in vivo and in vitro. TLR4 overexpression was also decreased by dioscin, leading to the markedly down-regulated levels of MyD88, NF-κB, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and type I collagen (COL1A1) in cultured HSCs. Suppression of cellular MyD88 by ST2825 or abrogation of NF-κB by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate eliminated the inhibitory effects of dioscin on the levels of TGF-β1, α-SMA and COL1A1.

To optimize the HAase inhibition activity, a central composite design was introduced based on four variables: the concentration of AC extract (: 1-5%), amount of starter culture (: 1-5%), pH (: 4-8), and fermentation time (: 0-10 days). The experimental data were fitted to quadratic regression equations, the accuracy of the equations was analyzed by ANOVA, and the regression coefficients for the surface quadratic model of HAase inhibition activity in the fermented AC extract were estimated by the  test and the corresponding  values. The HAase inhibition activity indicated that fermentation time was most significant among the parameters within the conditions tested. To validate the model, two different conditions among those generated by the Design Expert program were selected. Under both conditions, predicted and experimental data agreed well.

Polyphyllin I (PPI), one of the main components in the Rhizoma of Paris polyphyllin, displays a selective inhibitory effect on various tumor cells. Here we sought to investigate the anti-rheumatoid arthritis effects and mechanisms of PPI on macrophages  and .  , primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and peritoneal elucidated macrophages (PEMs) were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Interferon (IFN)-γ and then treated with PPI. We determined the degree of activation of IKKα/β and p65, two key mediators of the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway, by measuring their phosphorylated forms by Western blot. The p65 nuclear localization was detected by immunofluorescent staining. Further, a NF-κB-linked luciferase reporter plasmid, as well as those expressing key mediators of the Toll-like receptor 4 pathway, such as myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88), interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) associated kinase (IRAK)-1, TNF receptor associated factors (TRAF)-6, Transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and p65, were used to identify the mechanism by which PPI achieves its inhibitory effects on macrophage-mediated . Moreover, a NF-κB inhibitor, p65-targeted siRNAs, and a p65 plasmid were further used to validate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of PPI. , PPI (1 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically one time a day for 7 weeks starting on the 42nd day after the first immunization with collagen in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. Micro-computed Tomography scanning, histological examination, F4/80 and iNOS double immunofluorescent staining and CD4 immunohistochemical staining were performed to determine the effect of PPI treatment on joint structure and  in this model.  PPI reduced the inflammatory cytokines production of PEMs stimulated by LPS/IFN-γ, inhibited the phosphorylation of IKKα/β and p65, and prevented p65 nuclear localization. The NF-κB luciferase assay showed that the target of PPI was closely related to the NF-κB pathway. Moreover, NF-κB inhibition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p65, and p65 overexpression eliminated PPI's inhibitory effect. In addition, PPI attenuated the bone erosion and synovitis, as well as M1-like macrophage and T cell infiltration, in the ankle joint of the CIA model.  PPI demonstrated effective amelioration of synovial  in the ankle joint of CIA mice while suppressing NF-κB-mediated production of pro-inflammatory effectors in activated macrophages.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25853178>Potent effects of dioscin against liver fibrosis.</a></h1><p>We previously reported the promising effects of dioscin against liver injury, but its effect on liver fibrosis remains unknown. The present work investigated the activities of dioscin against liver fibrosis and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Dioscin effectively inhibited the cell viabilities of HSC-T6, LX-2 and primary rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), but not hepatocytes. Furthermore, dioscin markedly increased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) expression and significantly reduced a-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), collagen α1 (I) (COL1A1) and collagen α1 (III) (COL3A1) levels in vitro. Notably, dioscin inhibited HSCs activation and induced apoptosis in activated HSCs. In vivo, dioscin significantly improved body weight and hydroxylproline, laminin, α-SMA, TGF-β1, COL1A1 and COL3A1 levels, which were confirmed by histopathological assays. Dioscin facilitated matrix degradation, and exhibited hepatoprotective effects through the attenuation of oxidative stress and , in addition to exerting anti-fibrotic effects through the modulation of the TGF-β1/Smad, Wnt/β-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and mitochondrial signaling pathways, which triggered the senescence of activated HSCs.

In the present study, the activities and underlying mechanisms of dioscin in the inhibition of ischemic stroke in rats were investigated. Inflammatory responses wer analyzed using ELISA kits and caspase‑3 and caspase‑9 activity was analyzed using Caspase‑3 and caspase‑9 activity kits. Western blot analysis was used to measure Toll‑like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB), transforming growth factor‑β1 (TGF‑β1), high‑mobility group protein 1 (HMGB‑1), interleukin‑1 receptor‑associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), and tumor necrosis factor receptor‑associated factor 6 (TRAF6) protein expression.

In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of α-solanine isolated from "Jayoung" a dark purple-fleshed potato by examining its in vitro inhibitory effects on inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages and its in vivo effects on LPS-induced septic shock in a mouse model. α-Solanine suppressed the expression of iNOS and COX-2 both at protein and mRNA levels and consequently inhibited nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. α-Solanine also reduced the production and mRNA expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) induced by LPS. Furthermore, molecular mechanism studies indicated that α-solanine inhibited LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by reducing nuclear translocation of p65, degradation of inhibitory κBα (IκBα), and phosphorylation of IκB kinaseα/β (IKKα/β). In an in vivo experiment of LPS-induced endotoxemia, treatment with α-solanine suppressed mRNA expressions of iNOS, COX-2, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, and the activation of NF-κB in liver. Importantly, α-solanine increased the survival rate of mice in LPS-induced endotoxemia and polymicrobial sepsis models. Taken together, our data suggest that the α-solanine may be a promising therapeutic against inflammatory diseases by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. J. Cell.

Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms by which MPD induced apoptosis in MG-63 cells. The data showed that MPD significantly suppressed cell growth (cell viabilities: 22.5 ± 1.9% for 8 μM MPD versus 100 ± 1.4% for control, P < 0.01) and enhanced cell apoptosis. The exposure to MPD resulted in a significant induction of reactive oxygen species, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (P < 0.01, all cases). Furthermore, treatment with MPD increased the levels of phosphorylated JNK and p38 MAPK and markedly decreased the levels of phosphorylated ERK in MG-63 cells. Co-administration of the JNK-specific antagonist, the p38-specific antagonist, or the caspase antagonist (P < 0.05, all cases) has reversed the apoptotic effects in MPD treatment. We also found that exposure to MPD resulted in a significant reduction in the protein level of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, survivin, and XIAP (P < 0.05, all cases).

Dioscin shows anti-inflammatory effects in our previous works. However, the action of the compound on SIRS still remained unknown. In the present paper, zymosan induced generalized  (ZIGI) models in mice and rats, and PMA-differentiated THP‑1 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Pam3-Cys-Ser-Lys4 (Pam3CSK4) were used. The results showed that dioscin significantly inhibited the proliferation of THP‑1 cells stimulated by LPS and Pam3CSK4, obviously reduced the soakage of inflammatory cells and necrosis in liver, kidney and intestine of rats and mice, and reduced peritoneal ascites fluid compared with ZIGI model groups. In addition, dioscin significantly declined the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in rats and mice. The migration of macrophages in tissues was also suppressed by dioscin. Mechanism investigation showed that dioscin significantly inhibited the expression levels of TLR2, MyD88, NF‑κb, HMGB‑1, increased the expression levels of IKBα, and decreased the mRNA levels of interleukin‑1 beta (IL‑1β), interleukin‑6 (IL‑6) and tumor necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑α) in liver, kidney, intestine tissues of rats and mice, and in PMA-differentiated THP‑1 cells, which were further confirmed by TLR2 siRNA silencing in vitro.

Our results indicated that dioscin significantly protected against renal damage by decreasing blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels and reversing oxidative stress. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that dioscin markedly up- regulated the level of the microRNA let-7i, resulting in significant inhibition of TLR4 expression. Dioscin significantly down-regulated the levels of MyD88, NOX1 and cleaved caspase-8/3; inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB; inhibited PI3K and Akt phosphorylation; increased the levels of SOD2; and decreased the mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, MIP-1α, Fas and FasL. In vitro, transfection of microRNA let-7i inhibitor and TLR4 DNA were applied, and the results further confirmed the nephroprotective effect of dioscin in suppressing TLR4/MyD88 signaling and subsequently inhibiting , oxidative stress and apoptosis. Furthermore, the abrogation of cellular MyD88 expression by ST2825 eliminated the inhibitory effect of dioscin on the levels of nuclear NF-κB, cleaved caspase-3, SOD2 and ROS.
