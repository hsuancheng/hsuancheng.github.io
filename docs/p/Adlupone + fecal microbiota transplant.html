DNA was extracted and subjected to sequencing with an Illumina Miseq sequencer targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Sequences were analyzed with the Deblur algorithm in the QIIME2 package. A total of 19 phyla were detected in the lifetime pig gut microbiome with Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes being the most abundant. Alpha diversity including community richness (e.g., number of observed features) and diversity (e.g., Shannon index) showed an overall increasing trend. Distinct shifts in microbiome structure along different growth stages were observed. LEfSe analysis revealed 91 bacterial features that are stage-specific. To validate these discoveries, we performed    (FMT) by inoculating weanling pigs with mature   from a growing stage pig. Similar stage-specific patterns in microbiome diversity and structures were also observed in both the FMT pigs and their littermates. Although FMT remarkably increased growth performance, it did not change the overall swine gut microbiome. Only a few taxa including those associated with Streptococcus and Clostridiaceae were enriched in the FMT pigs. These data, together with several other lines of evidence, indicate potential roles these taxa play in promoting animal growth performance. Diet, especially crude fiber from corn, was a major factor shaping the swine gut microbiome. The priority effect, i.e., the order and timing of species arrival, was more evident in the solid feed stages.The distinct stage-associated swine gut microbiome may be determined by the differences in diet and/or gut physiology at different growth stages. Our study provides insight into mechanisms governing gut microbiome succession and also underscores the importance of optimizing stage-specific probiotics aimed at improving animal health and production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644957>   for C. difficile infection: Just say yes.</a></h2><p>The burden of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea is a worrying clinical issue worldwide, mainly as regarding the high incidence of recurrences after standard antibiotic therapy and the risk for more severe clinical manifestations.

We anticipate that the next frontier of   will be vaginal   (VMT). The composition of the vaginal  has broad impact on sexual and reproductive health.

Diversity in the  and the concomitant depletion of lactobacilli, a condition referred to as bacterial vaginosis (BV), is associated with a wide range of deleterious effects, including increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections and increased likelihood of having a preterm birth. However, we have very few treatment options available, and none of them curative or restorative, for "resetting" the vaginal  to a more protective state. In order to test the hypothesis that VMT may be a more effective treatment option, we must first determine how to screen donors to find those with minimal risk of pathogen transmission and "optimal" vaginal  for . Here, we describe a universal donor screening approach that was implemented in a small pilot study of 20 women. We further characterized key physicochemical properties of donor cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) and the corresponding composition of the vaginal  to delineate criteria for inclusion/exclusion.

The intestinal  is a natural resource for production of therapeutic and preventive medicals, such as probiotics and  . Modern lifestyles have resulted in the extinction of evolutionally selected microbial populations upon exposure to environmental factors. Therefore, it is very important to preserve the human gut  to have the opportunity for timely restoration with minimal safety risks. Cryopreservation techniques that are suitable for the preservation of viable, mixed microbial communities and a biobanking approach are currently under development in different countries. However, the number of studies in this area is very limited. The variety of morphological and physiological characteristics of microbes in the , the different cryopreservation goals, and the criteria for the evaluation of cryopreservation effectiveness are the main challenges in the creation of a universal and standardized cryopreservation protocol. In this review, we summarized the current progress of the main cryopreservation techniques for gut  communities and the methods for the assessment of the effectiveness of these techniques in the context of practical application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Immune-mediated diarrhea and enterocolitis are among the most frequently encountered adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Given the increasing use of these therapies in the treatment of an ever-growing number of malignancies, providing appropriate treatment for such adverse effects has become crucial.In this review, we summarize the current body of evidence concerning the management of immune-mediated diarrhea and enterocolitis. Additionally, management of immune-mediated diarrhea and enterocolitis is likened to that of inflammatory bowel disease, given the resemblance between both entities in pathogenesis and clinical features. Reviewing the literature raised several points regarding this devastating toxicity that still need further investigation by future efforts.Endoscopic and histologic evaluation is pivotal in the assessment of immune-mediated diarrhea and enterocolitis and provides vital information regarding the severity of the disease to guide treatment. Corticosteroids are the main therapy for immune-mediated diarrhea and enterocolitis, with infliximab and vedolizumab as second-line agents. Recently,    has emerged as a treatment option for immune-mediated diarrhea and enterocolitis that is refractory to corticosteroids. Restarting immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy after resolution of immune-mediated diarrhea and enterocolitis carries a risk of recurrence that is mostly controllable with current immune-suppressive treatment.Lastly, we propose a management algorithm for immune-mediated diarrhea and enterocolitis. Prospective research, preferably as collaborative efforts from oncology and gastroenterology specialists, is needed to refine the management of immune-mediated diarrhea and enterocolitis.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

In this study, we comparatively examined the  microbiomes of Amish (rural) and non-Amish (urban) infants and investigated how they could affect the mucosal immune maturation in germ-free piglets that were inoculated with the two types of infant   (IFM). Differences in microbiome diversity and structure were noted between the two types of  microbiotas. The   of the non-Amish (urban) infants had a greater relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla, while that of the Amish (rural) counterparts was dominated by Firmicutes. Amish infants had greater species richness compared with the non-Amish infants' . The  microbiotas of the Amish and the non-Amish infants were successfully transplanted into germ-free piglets, and the diversity and structure of the  in the transplanted piglets remained similar at phylum level but not at the genus level. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on Weighted-UniFrac distance revealed distinct  structure in the intestines of the transplanted piglets. Shotgun metagenomic analysis also revealed clear differences in functional diversity of  microbiome between Amish and non-Amish donors as well as  transplanted piglets. Specific functional features were enriched in either of the  transplanted piglet groups directly corresponding to the predominance of certain bacterial populations in their gut environment. Some of the colonized bacterial genera were correlated with the frequency of important lymphoid and myeloid immune cells in the ileal submucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), both important for mucosal immune maturation. Overall, this study demonstrated that  of diverse IFM into germ-free piglets largely recapitulates the differences in gut  structure between rural (Amish) and urban (non-Amish) infants. Thus,    to germ-free piglets could be a useful large animal model system for elucidating the impact of gut  on the mucosal immune system development. Future studies can focus on determining the additional advantages of the pig model over the rodent model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332389>Healthspan and lifespan extension by    into progeroid mice.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome is emerging as a key regulator of several metabolic, immune and neuroendocrine pathways. Gut microbiome deregulation has been implicated in major conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty acid liver disease and cancer, but its precise role in aging remains to be elucidated. Here, we find that two different mouse models of progeria are characterized by intestinal dysbiosis with alterations that include an increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, and a decrease in the abundance of Verrucomicrobia. Consistent with these findings, we found that human progeria patients also display intestinal dysbiosis and that long-lived humans (that is, centenarians) exhibit a substantial increase in Verrucomicrobia and a reduction in Proteobacteria.    from wild-type mice enhanced healthspan and lifespan in both progeroid mouse models, and  with the verrucomicrobia Akkermansia muciniphila was sufficient to exert beneficial effects. Moreover, metabolomic analysis of ileal content points to the restoration of secondary bile acids as a possible mechanism for the beneficial effects of reestablishing a healthy microbiome. Our results demonstrate that correction of the accelerated aging-associated intestinal dysbiosis is beneficial, suggesting the existence of a link between aging and the gut  that provides a rationale for microbiome-based interventions against age-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244784>The Microbiome and Irritable Bowel Syndrome - A Review on the Pathophysiology, Current Research and Future Therapy.</a></h2><p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder which affects a large proportion of the population globally. The precise etiology of IBS is still unknown, although consensus understanding proposes IBS to be of multifactorial origin with yet undefined subtypes. Genetic and epigenetic factors, stress-related nervous and endocrine systems, immune dysregulation and the brain-gut axis seem to be contributing factors that predispose individuals to IBS. In addition to food hypersensitivity, toxins and adverse life events, chronic infections and dysbiotic gut  have been suggested to trigger IBS symptoms in tandem with the predisposing factors. This review will summarize the pathophysiology of IBS and the role of gut  in relation to IBS. Current methodologies for microbiome studies in IBS such as genome sequencing, metagenomics, culturomics and animal models will be discussed. The myriad of therapy options such as immunoglobulins (immune-based therapy), probiotics and prebiotics, dietary modifications including FODMAP restriction diet and gluten-free diet, as well as   will be reviewed.

Over the last years, several studies have been conducted toward the assessment of the host-gut microbiota interaction, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of several diseases. A defect on the microbiota-host crosstalk and the concomitant dysregulation of immune responses combined with genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). To this end, novel therapeutic options based on the gut microbiota modulation have been an area of extensive research interest. In this review we present the recent findings on the association of  with IBD pathogenesis, we focus on the role of gut microbiota on the treatment of IBD and discuss the novel and currently available therapeutic strategies in manipulating the composition and function of gut microbiota in IBD patients. Applicable and emerging microbiota treatment modalities, such as the use of antibiotics, prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) constitute promising therapeutic options. However, the therapeutic potential of the aforementioned approaches is a topic of investigation and further studies are needed to elucidate their position in the present treatment algorithms of IBD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

But it is also a heavy process with an important risk of complications, particularly infection and graft versus host disease. Increasing data in literature show that an alteration of the intestinal microbiota of allogeneic stem cell recipients is associated with these complications. Indeed, treatments used during conditioning regimen lead to an impaired microbiota, which cannot fulfill its protective functions anymore. To limit this microbiota impairment, we could restore a healthy microbiota by a fecal microbiota transplantation, which has already shown its efficiency in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. The aim of this review is to describe the intestinal microbiota, the link between microbiota and complications of allogeneic stem cells transplantation, and the recent published data on fecal microbiota transplantation in this field.Copyright © 2019 Société Française du Cancer.

This study appraises current literature and provides an overview of the effectiveness and limitations of FMT as a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS). Five electronic databases and two gray literature sources were searched up to 10 December 2018. All interventional and observational studies that contained information on the relevant population (adult patients with obesity and MS), intervention (receiving allogeneic FMT) and outcomes (metabolic parameters) were eligible. From 1096 unique citations, three randomized placebo-controlled studies (76 patients with obesity and MS, body mass index = 34.8 ± 4.1 kg/m, fasting plasma glucose = 5.8 ± 0.7 mmol/L) were included for review. Studies reported mixed results with regards to improvement in metabolic parameters. Two studies reported improved peripheral insulin sensitivity (rate of glucose disappearance, RD) at 6 weeks in patients receiving donor FMT versus patients receiving the placebo control. In addition, one study observed lower HbA1c levels in FMT patients at 6 weeks. No differences in fasting plasma glucose, hepatic insulin sensitivity, body mass index (BMI), or cholesterol markers were observed between two groups across all included studies. While promising, the influence of FMT on long-term clinical endpoints needs to be further explored.

A recent study found an association between butyrate-producing gut (BPG) bacteria and less frequent development of lower respiratory viral infections in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell  recipients (Haak et al, Blood 131(26): 2978, 2018). In this investigation, we examine the relationship between the abundance of BPG bacteria and the development of viral infections in a cohort of kidney  recipients.We recruited 168 kidney  recipients who provided 510  specimens in the first 3 months after  and profiled the gut  using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V4-V5 hypervariable region. We classified the kidney  recipients into higher BPG Bacteria Group and lower BPG Bacteria Group using the same criteria of 1% relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria as the Haak et al study.Administration of antibiotics against anaerobes was associated with a significant decrease in the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria. The higher BPG Bacteria Group was associated with less development of respiratory viral infections (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.28, P = .01) but not with less development of CMV viremia (HR: 0.38, P = .13) or BK viremia (HR: 1.02, P = .98) at 2 years post .Our pilot investigation supports future validation of the relationship between high relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria and decreased risk for development of respiratory viral infections.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250122>  : a Future Therapeutic Option for Obesity/Diabetes?</a></h2><p>The aim of this review is to summarize the current data available on the metabolic effects of    (FMT) including obesity and glucose metabolism in humans.Gut  dysbiosis is a frequent characteristic observed in obesity and related metabolic diseases. Pieces of evidence mostly generated in mouse models suggest that rescuing this dysbiosis associates with improved metabolism. In humans, dietary or bariatric surgery interventions are often accompanied by complete or partial restoration of this dysbiosis together with weight reduction and metabolic amelioration. FMT is an interesting option to modify gut  and has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, albeit only used in routine care for Clostridium difficile infection. However, there are only limited data on using FMT in the metabolic context. FMT from lean donors significantly improves insulin sensitivity in obese subjects with metabolic syndrome. However, there is a wide range of clinical responses. Interestingly in subjects with high microbial gene richness at baseline and when FMT donors that are metabolically compromised are used, no metabolic improvement is seen. Moreover, more studies evaluating the effect of FMT in patients with overt type 2 diabetes are warranted.

The training of FMT in medical schools is at its beginning and in countries where FMT is only occasionally carried out, it is important to know the perception of medical students on FMT.We undertook a survey of 3rd year medical students not exposed to official academic information on FMT in order to find out their knowledge, beliefs and attitude toward FMT. A number of 80 students were asked to fill a dedicated online questionnaire.52 out of 80 third year medical students anonymously filled the questionnaire (65% response rate). 34% of respondents reported to have at least a medium level of knowledge regarding FMT. The top indication for FMT identified by 76.9% was C. difficile infection; however, 60% believed FMT to be a promising therapy for a high number of conditions and while almost all respondents (98.1%) would recommend it, 88.4% would explore other options first. Colonoscopy was considered the optimal method of delivery by 42.3%. Only 39% of participants believed that patients would accept FMT, however 71% considered that a more socially acceptable name for the procedure and anonymous donors would increase acceptance rate. The risk of transmitting a disease undetected by donor stool screening procedures to the recipient was the most worrying side effect considered by 75% of respondents. 54% believed that more research is required for FMT to enter clinical practice and 55.7% of respondents would enroll patients in controlled clinical trials.Medical students not exposed to educational information on FMT seem to be somewhat well informed about this method and would recommend it to their patients.

Articles were selected using the following search terms: "gut ," "heart failure," "trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)," "short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)," "bile acid," "uremic toxin," "treatment," "diet," "probiotic," "prebiotic," "antibiotic," and "  ."Accumulated evidence has revealed that the composition of the gut  varies obviously in people with heart failure compared to those with healthy status. Altered gut microbial communities contribute to heart failure through bacterial translocation or affecting multiple metabolic pathways, including the trimethylamine/TMAO, SCFA, bile acid, and uremic toxin pathways. Meanwhile, modulation of the gut  through diet, pre/probiotics,  , and microbial enzyme inhibitors has become a potential therapeutic approach for many metabolic disorders. Specifically, a few studies have focused on the cardioprotective effects of probiotics on heart failure.The composition of the gut  in people with heart failure is different from those with healthy status. A reduction in SCFA-producing bacteria in patients with heart failure might be a notable characteristic for patients with heart failure.

To our knowledge, we report the youngest immunocompromised patient to undergo FMT and the third overall case of FMT in a child after HTx. Our patient presented with five episodes of rCDI in 6 months, and 16S rRNA genetic analysis revealed significant loss of overall  community structure and diversity prior to FMT compared with a donor and a healthy, age-matched control. After FMT, marked and prolonged (at least 16 months) shifts in the recipient  community structure and diversity were evident, approaching that of donor and healthy, age-matched control. FMT was well tolerated, restored microbial diversity without any graft or  complications, and prevented further rCDI episodes after more than 4 years of follow-up.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391545> of  from drug-free patients with schizophrenia causes schizophrenia-like abnormal behaviors and dysregulated kynurenine metabolism in mice.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that gut  plays a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia via the -gut-brain axis.

Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of    (FMT) for the eradication of MDRO. A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies on the use of FMT for the decolonization of MDRO. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception through January 2019. Of the 1395 articles identified, 20 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Overall, the efficacy of FMT for the eradication of each MDRO was 70.3% (102/146) in 121 patients from the 20 articles. The efficacy rates were 68.2% (30/44) for gram-positive bacteria and 70.6% (72/102) for gram-negative bacteria. Minor adverse events, including vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and ileus, were reported in patients who received FMT. FMT could be a promising strategy to eradicate MDRO in patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish a comprehensive FMT protocol for standardized treatment.

Over the last 2 decades evidence has emerged to suggest that inflammation-derived oxidative damage and cytokine induced toxicity may play a significant role in the neuronal damage associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and T cell infiltration has been observed in the brain parenchyma of patients with PD. Furthermore, evidence for inflammatory changes has been reported in the enteric nervous system, the vagus nerve branches and glial cells. The presence of α-synuclein deposits in the post-mortem brain biopsy in patients with PD has further substantiated the role of inflammation in PD. It has been suggested that the α-synuclein misfolding might begin in the gut and spread "prion like" via the vagus nerve into lower brainstem and ultimately to the midbrain; this is known as the Braak hypothesis. It is noteworthy that the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms (constipation, dysphagia, and hypersalivation), altered gut  and leaky gut have been observed in PD patients several years prior to the clinical onset of the disease. These clinical observations have been supported by in vitro studies in mice as well, demonstrating the role of genetic (α-synuclein overexpression) and environmental (gut dysbiosis) factors in the pathogenesis of PD.

Alterations of the gut  contribute to pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver disease. Patients with alcohol-associated liver disease have increased proportions of Candida spp. in the  mycobiome. However, little is known about the effect of intestinal Candida on alcohol-associated liver disease. Here we evaluated the contributions of Candida albicans and its exotoxin Candidalysin on alcoholic liver disease.C. albicans and ECE1 were analyzed in  samples from controls, patients with alcohol use disorder and alcoholic hepatitis. Mice colonized with different and genetically manipulated C. albicans strains were subjected to the chronic-plus-binge ethanol diet model. Primary hepatocytes were isolated and incubated with Candidalysin.The percentages of subjects carrying ECE1 are 0%, 4.76% and 30.77% in non-alcoholic controls, alcohol use disorder patients and alcoholic hepatitis patients, respectively. Candidalysin exacerbates ethanol-induced liver disease and is associated with increased mortality in mice. Candidalysin enhances ethanol-induced liver disease independent of the β-glucan receptor CLEC7A on bone-marrow derived cells, and Candidalysin does not alter gut barrier function. Candidalysin can damage primary hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and is associated with liver disease severity and mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.Candidalysin is associated with progression of ethanol-induced liver disease in preclinical models and worse clinical outcomes in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.Candidalysin is a peptide toxin secreted by the commensal gut fungus Candida albicans. Candidalysin enhances alcohol-associated liver disease independent of the β-glucan receptor CLEC7A on bone-marrow derived cells in mice without affecting intestinal permeability. Candidalysin is cytotoxic to primary hepatocytes, indicating a direct role of Candidalysin on ethanol-induced liver disease.

To date, most clinical experience with FMT originates from the treatment of recurrent or refractory Clostridioides difficile infections (rCDI), with resolution rates up to 90%. In addition to CDI, a role for the intestinal microbiome has been implicated in several disorders. FMT has been tested in several randomized controlled trials for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel disease and constipation with mixed results. FMT has also been explored for extra-gastrointestinal disorders such as metabolic syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy and graft-versus-host disease. With the exception of recurrent CDI, FMT is currently used in experimental settings only and should not yet be offered as standard care.

We have recently shown that conventional mice are protected from  infection, which was not the case for human  associated (hma) mice indicating that the host-specific gut  composition primarily determines susceptibility to or resistance against  infection. In our present preclinical intervention study we addressed whether gut  changes in stably  infected hma mice following murine    (mFMT) could alleviate pathogen-induced immune responses. To accomplish this, secondary abiotic C57BL/6 mice were generated by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, perorally reassociated with a complex human gut  and challenged with  by gavage. Seven days later  infected hma mice were subjected to peroral mFMT on 3 consecutive days. Within a week post-mFMT  pathogenic burdens had decreased by two orders of magnitude, whereas distinct changes in the gut  composition with elevated numbers of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could be assessed. In addition, mFMT resulted in less  induced apoptotic responses in colonic epithelia, reduced numbers of macrophages and monocytes as well as of T lymphocytes in the large intestinal mucosa and lamina propria and in less distinct intestinal pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion as compared to mock challenge. Strikingly, inflammation dampening effects of mFMT were not restricted to the intestinal tract, but could also be observed systemically as indicated by elevated serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-12p70, and IL-6 in  infected hma mice of the mock, but not the mFMT cohort. In conclusion, our preclinical mFMT intervention study provides evidence that changes in the gut  composition which might be achieved by pre- or probiotic formulations may effectively lower intestinal  loads, dampen both, pathogen-induced intestinal and systemic inflammatory sequelae and may represent a useful tool to treat continuous shedding of  by asymptomatic carriers which is critical in the context of food production, hospitalization and immunosuppression.Copyright © 2019 Heimesaat, Mrazek and Bereswill.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412603>Alteration of Gut  in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): Cause or Consequence?

Although the etiology of IBD is unknown, gut  alteration (dysbiosis) is considered a novel factor involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. The gut  acts as a metabolic organ and contributes to human health by performing various physiological functions; deviation in the gut flora composition is involved in various disease pathologies, including IBD. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge of gut  alteration in IBD and how this contributes to intestinal inflammation, as well as explore the potential role of gut -based treatment approaches for the prevention and treatment of IBD. The current literature has clearly demonstrated a perturbation of the gut  in IBD patients and mice colitis models, but a clear causal link of cause and effect has not yet been presented. In addition, gut -based therapeutic approaches have also shown good evidence of their effects in the amelioration of colitis in animal models (mice) and IBD patients, which indicates that gut flora might be a new promising therapeutic target for the treatment of IBD. However, insufficient data and confusing results from previous studies have led to a failure to define a core microbiome associated with IBD and the hidden mechanism of pathogenesis, which suggests that well-designed randomized control trials and mouse models are required for further research. In addition, a better understanding of this ecosystem will also determine the role of prebiotics and probiotics as therapeutic agents in the management of IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560732> of MR1 deficient mice confer resistance against Clostridium difficile infection.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile (Cd) infection (CDI) typically occurs after antibiotic usage perturbs the gut . Mucosa-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) are found in the gut and their development is dependent on Major histocompatibility complex-related protein 1 (MR1) and the host microbiome. Here we were interested in determining whether the absence of MR1 impacts resistance to CDI. To this end, wild-type (WT) and MR1-/- mice were treated with antibiotics and then infected with Cd spores. Surprisingly, MR1-/- mice exhibited resistance to Cd colonization. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of  revealed inherent differences in microbial composition. This colonization resistance was transferred from MR1-/- to WT mice via   , suggesting that MR1-dependent factors influence the , leading to CDI susceptibility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613980>[The Role of Gut  in Autism Spectrum Disorder].</a></h2><p>Human  are colonies of microorganisms located in different parts of the human body with diverse functions. Healthy gut  comprises differing ratios of microoganisms wholly contributing to metabolic and other molecular reactions in a healthy, functioning body. After the demonstration of the bidirectional interaction between the central nervous system and gut  through neuroendocrine, neuroimmune, and autonomic nervous mechanisms, investigations have been started on the -gut-brain axis in psychiatric disorders. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is a neurodevelopmental disorder of early childhood, is one of these disorders. Most of such studies were cross-sectional and mainly investigated the bacterial species. Changes in gut  composition and the leaky gut syndrome are some of the hypotheses proposed to explain the core symptoms and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of ASD. Probiotics, prebiotics,   , diet have been proposed as treatment options. However, the role of  in diagnosis, followup, and treatment is not yet clear. The bidirectional interaction between central nervous system and intestinal  makes it difficult to establish the cause-effect relationship. The current data on  may be useful to plan patient-specific treatment in autistic children with GI symptoms.

Vancomycin, the antimicrobial agent usually used to treat bacterial nosocomial infections, is associated with gut dysbiosis. As a lung-gut immunologic axis has been described, this study aimed to evaluate both the immunologic and histopathologic effects on the lungs and the large intestine resulting from vancomycin-induced gut dysbiosis in the P. aeruginosa pneumonia murine model. Metagenomic analysis demonstrated that vancomycin-induced gut dysbiosis resulted in higher Proteobacteria and lower Bacteroidetes populations in . Given that gut dysbiosis could augment the proinflammatory status of the intestines leading to a variety of acute inflammatory diseases, bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated with cecal content from dysbiotic mice showing a higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and lower expression of IL-10. Dysbiotic mice showed higher levels of viable bacteria in the lungs and spleen when acutely infected with P. aeruginosa, with more lung and cecal damage and increased IL-10 expression in bronchoalveolar lavage. The susceptible and tissue damage phenotype was reversed when dysbiotic mice received   . In spite of higher recruitment of CD11b+ cells in the lungs, there was no higher CD80+ expression, DC+ cell amounts or proinflammatory cytokine expression. Taken together, our results indicate that the bacterial community found in vancomycin-induced dysbiosis dysregulates the gut inflammatory status, influencing the lung-gut immunologic axis to favor increased opportunistic infections, for example, by P. aeruginosa.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543403>Fatty Liver Disease Caused by High-Alcohol-Producing Klebsiella pneumoniae.</a></h2><p>The underlying etiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is believed to be quite varied. Changes in the gut  have been investigated and are believed to contribute to at least some cases of the disease, though a causal relationship remains unclear. Here, we show that high-alcohol-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (HiAlc Kpn) is associated with up to 60% of individuals with NAFLD in a Chinese cohort. Transfer of clinical isolates of HiAlc Kpn by oral gavage into mice induced NAFLD. Likewise,    (FMT) into mice using a HiAlc-Kpn-strain-containing  isolated from an individual with NASH induced NAFLD. However, selective elimination of the HiAlc Kpn strain before FMT prevented NAFLD in the recipient mice. These results suggest that at least in some cases of NAFLD an alteration in the gut microbiome drives the condition due to excess endogenous alcohol production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Part of the difficulty for translating research into medical interventions is due to the large compositional complexity of the microbiome resulting in datasets that need sophisticated statistical methods for their analysis and do not lend to industrial applications. Another part of the difficulty might be due to logical flaws in terminology particularly concerning 'dysbiosis' that avoids circular conclusions and is based on sound ecological and evolutionary reasoning. Many case-control studies are underpowered necessitating more meta-analyses that sort out consistent from spurious dysbiosis-disease associations. We also need for the microbiome a transition from statistical associations to causal relationships with diseases that fulfil a set of modified Koch's postulates for commensals. Disturbingly, the most sophisticated statistical analyses explain only a small percentage of the variance in the microbiome. Microbe-microbe interactions irrelevant to the host and stochastic processes might play a greater role than anticipated. To satisfy the concept of Karl Popper about conjectures and refutations in the scientific process, we should also conduct more experiments that try to refute the role of the commensal gut  for human health and disease.© 2019 The Authors.

Our previous study demonstrated that cerebral ischemic stroke triggers dysfunctional gut  and increased intestinal permeability. In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanism by which gut  and SCFAs can treat cerebral ischemic stroke in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion models and use the information to develop new therapies. Our results show that oral administration of non-absorbable antibiotics reduced neurological impairment and the cerebral infarct volume, relieved cerebral edemas, and decreased blood lipid levels by altering the gut . We also found that ischemic stroke decreased intestinal levels of SCFAs. And that transplanting   rich in these metabolites was an effective means of treating the condition. Compared with other SCFAs, butyric acid showed the highest negative correlation with ischemic stroke. Supplementation with butyric acid treated models of ischemic stroke effectively by remodeling the gut , enriching the beneficial Lactobacillus, and repairing the leaky gut. In conclusion, interfering with the gut  by transplanting  bacteria rich in SCFAs and supplementing with butyric acid were found to be effective treatments for cerebral ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Improvement of intestinal inflammation occurs through restoration of the immunological balance between pro-inflammatory T-helper 1 (Th1) responses and both T-helper 2 (Th2) and regulatory responses. However, detailed mechanisms explaining how P28GST prevents colitis and promotes gut homeostasis remain unknown. Considering the complex interplay between the adaptive and innate immune system and the intestinal , we raised the question of the possible role of the microbial ecosystem in the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the helminth-derived P28GST protein. We first analyzed, by 16S rRNA sequencing, the bacterial profiles of mice   at several time points of the P28GST-immunomodulation period prior to trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-colitis. The influence of gut  in the P28GST-mediated anti-inflammatory effects was then assessed by    experiments from P28GST-immunized mice to either conventional or  depleted naïve recipient mice. Finally, the experimental data were supplemented by the temporal   compositions of P28GST-treated Crohn's disease patients from a pilot clinical study (). The P28GST administration slightly modulated the diversity and composition of mouse   while it significantly reduced experimental colitis in mice.    experiments failed to restore the P28GST-induced anti-inflammatory effects. In Crohn's disease patients, P28GST also induced slight changes in their overall  bacterial composition. Collectively, these results provide key elements in both the anti-inflammatory mechanisms and the safe therapeutic use of immunomodulation with such promising helminth-derived molecules.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624757>Hair regrowth following    in an elderly patient with alopecia areata: A case report and review of the literature.</a></h2><p>Alopecia areata is a hair loss disease associated with genetics, autoimmunity, and other factors. There is an intriguing link between alopecia areata and gut dysbiosis.    (FMT) has been recommended to treat  (previously known as ) infection, and has also shown potentials in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and non-alcohol fatty liver disease.An 86-year-old man, with a history of sigmoid colon carcinoma, suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and distension, and diarrhea for six months, with inappetence. At admission, he was also diagnosed with depression. Upon physical examination, the patient presented with a 1.5 cm × 2.0 cm alopecia areata on his right occiput. Due to the negative results of laboratory testing, capsule endoscopy, and colonoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with noninfectious diarrhea, depressive disorder, and patchy alopecia areata. Considering that noninfectious diarrhea in the elderly patient was mainly caused by gut dysbiosis, he was given six rounds of FMT. His diarrhea improved remarkably one month after FMT, with improved appetite and disappearance of abdominal pain, distension, and depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, he reported new hair growth on the affected region of his scalp, with some of his white hair gradually turning to black, without taking any other therapies for alopecia areata before and after FMT.FMT might act as a potential therapy for patients who suffer from alopecia areata. Large and well-designed studies are required to confirm the role of FMT in alopecia areata.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

The intestinal  has various functions including host protection from overgrowth or colonization by unwanted bacteria. The exposure to antibiotics significantly reduces the bacterial density of intestinal  leaving an ecologic void that can be occupied by potentially pathogenic and/or resistant bacteria frequently present in hospital settings. Consequently, the intestinal  of inpatients acts as a major reservoir and plays a critical role in perpetuating the spread of resistant bacteria. There are novel innovative methods to protect the host  during antibiotic treatment, but they do not offer a solution for already established colonization by resistant microorganisms.   transfer (FMT) is a promising intervention to achieve this goal; however, controlled trials report lower success rates than initial retrospective studies, especially in case of gram negatives. The aim of the present article is to highlight the importance of the intestinal  in the global spread of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms and to review the recent advances to protect the human  from the action of antibiotics as well as a critical discussion about the evidence of decolonization of MDR microorganisms by FMT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293718>Dietary approach and gut  modulation for chronic hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common and serious neuropsychiatric complication of cirrhosis, acute liver failure, and porto-systemic shunting. HE largely contributes to the morbidity of patients with liver disease, severely affecting the quality of life of both patients and their relatives and being associated with poor prognosis. Its presentation is largely variable, manifesting with a broad spectrum of cognitive abnormalities ranging from subtle cognitive impairment to coma. The pathogenesis of HE is complex and has historically been linked with hyperammonemia. However, in the last years, it has become evident that the interplay of multiple actors, such as intestinal dysbiosis, gut hyperpermeability, and neuroinflammation, is of crucial importance in its genesis. Therefore, HE can be considered a result of a dysregulated gut-liver-brain axis function, where cognitive impairment can be reversed or prevented by the beneficial effects induced by "gut-centric" therapies, such as non-absorbable disaccharides, non-absorbable antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, and   . In this context dietary modifications, by modulating the intestinal milieu, can also provide significant benefit to cirrhotic patients with HE. This review will provide a comprehensive insight into the mechanisms responsible for gut-liver-brain axis dysregulation leading to HE in cirrhosis. Furthermore, it will explore the currently available therapies and the most promising future treatments for the management of patients with HE, with a special focus on the dietary approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250035>Bridging intestinal immunity and gut  by metabolites.</a></h2><p>The gastrointestinal tract is the site of nutrient digestion and absorption and is also colonized by diverse, highly mutualistic microbes. The intestinal  has diverse effects on the development and function of the gut-specific immune system, and provides some protection from infectious pathogens. However, interactions between intestinal immunity and microorganisms are very complex, and recent studies have revealed that this intimate crosstalk may depend on the production and sensing abilities of multiple bioactive small molecule metabolites originating from direct produced by the gut  or by the metabolism of dietary components.

To address this need we present an innovative scalable comprehensive analysis workflow, a healthy human reference microbiome list and abundance profile (GutFeelingKB), and a novel  Biome Population Report (FecalBiome) with clinical applicability. GutFeelingKB provides a list of 157 organisms (8 phyla, 18 classes, 23 orders, 38 families, 59 genera and 109 species) that forms the baseline biome and therefore can be used as healthy controls for studies related to dysbiosis. This list can be expanded to 863 organisms if closely related proteomes are considered. The incorporation of microbiome science into routine clinical practice necessitates a standard report for comparison of an individual's microbiome to the growing knowledgebase of "normal" microbiome data. The FecalBiome and the underlying technology of GutFeelingKB address this need. The knowledgebase can be useful to regulatory agencies for the assessment of   and other microbiome products, as it contains a list of organisms from healthy individuals. In addition to the list of organisms and their abundances, this study also generated a collection of assembled contiguous sequences (contigs) of metagenomics dark matter. In this study, metagenomic dark matter represents sequences that cannot be mapped to any known sequence but can be assembled into contigs of 10,000 nucleotides or higher.

While high-dose steroids are the established first-line therapy in GVHD, no second-line therapy is generally accepted. In this analysis of 65 consecutive patients with severe, steroid-resistant, intestinal GVHD (92% stage 4), additional ileostomy surgery significantly reduced overall mortality (hazard ratio 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.81; p = 0.003) compared to conventional GVHD therapy. Median overall survival was 16 months in the ileostomy cohort compared to 4 months in the conventional therapy cohort.

Patients received a minimum of a single FMT by pouchoscopy from healthy, screened donors. The primary outcome was clinical improvement in pouchitis assessed by patient survey at week 4. Secondary outcomes included decrease in total Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) Score ≥ 3 at week 4, bowel movement frequency, ESR, CRP,  calprotectin, abdominal pain, and PDAI subscores including endoscopic and histologic changes. Stool samples were collected at baseline and 4 weeks post-FMT to assess bacterial  using V4 16S rRNA sequencing.Nineteen patients were enrolled; however, 1 patient was lost to follow-up. No patients had a major adverse event or escalation of therapy related to FMT. Total PDAI scores, endoscopic scores, and histologic scores did not decrease significantly post-FMT. However, there was a statistically significant improvement in bowel movement (BM) frequency (9.25-7.25 BM/day, p = 0.03) and trend for improvement in abdominal pain to improve post-FMT (p = 0.05). Bacterial  profiling revealed no distinct community-level changes post-FMT, though a small number of specific bacterial taxa significantly differed in relative abundance.A single FMT has a tolerable short-term safety profile and may be associated with a decrease in bowel movements in patients with chronic pouchitis; however, no robust endoscopic or histologic changes were observed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551944>Alterations in Gut  by Statin Therapy and Possible Intermediate Effects on Hyperglycemia and Hyperlipidemia.</a></h2><p>Dysbiosis of the gut  is a contributing factor for obesity-related metabolic diseases such as hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia.

It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and    combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH.

Yet, the underlying mechanisms and corresponding interactions remain poorly understood.We conducted a critical and extensive literature review to explore the association between dysbiosis and the development of inflammatory arthropathies. We also reviewed the literature to assess the perspectives that ameliorate inflammatory arthropathies by manipulating the  with probiotics, prebiotics or   .Some bacterial species (e.g. Prevotella, Citrobacter rodentium, Collinsella aerofaciens, Segmented filamentous bacteria) participate in the creation of the pro-inflammatory immune status, presumably via epitope mimicry, modification of self-antigens, enhanced cell apoptosis mechanisms, and destruction of tight junction proteins and intestinal barrier integrity, all leading to the development and maintainance of inflammatory arthropathies. Whether dysbiosis is an epiphenomenon or is an active driver of these disorders remains unclear, yet, recent observations clearly suggest that dysbiosis precedes and triggers their development implying a causative relationship between dysbiosis and inflammatory arthropathies. The underlying mechanisms include dysbiosis-mediated changes in the functional activity of the intestinal immune cell subsets, such as innate lymphoid cells, mucosa-associated invariant T cells, invariant natural killer T cells, T-follicular helper and T-regulatory cells. In turn, disturbed functionality of the gut-associated immune system is shown to promote the overgrowth of many bacteria, thus establishing a detrimental vicious circle of actively maintaining arthritis.Analysis of the data described in the review supports the notion that a close, dynamic and tightly regulated cross talk between dysbiosis and the gut-associated immune system governs the development of inflammatory arthropathies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This reciprocal interaction is established through the vascular route of the portal vein that carries gut-derived products directly to the liver, and the liver feed-back route of bile and antibody secretion to the intestine. The intestinal mucosal and vascular barrier is the functional and anatomical structure that serves as a playground for the interactions between the gut and the liver, limiting the systemic dissemination of microbes and toxins while allowing nutrients to access the circulation and to reach the liver. The control of microbial communities is critical to maintain homeostasis of the gut-liver axis, and as part of the two-way communication the liver shapes intestinal microbial communities. Alcohol disrupts the gut-liver axis at multiple interconnected levels, including the gut microbiome, mucus, epithelial barrier and antimicrobial peptides production, which increases the microbial exposure and the pro-inflammatory environment of the liver. Growing evidences indicate the pathogenetic role of microbe-derived metabolites, such as trimethylamine, secondary bile acids, SCFA and ethanol, in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis by itself is associated to profound alterations in gut  and damage at the different levels of defense of the intestinal barrier, including the epithelial, the vascular and the immune barriers. The relevance of the severe disturbance of the intestinal barrier in cirrhosis has been linked to translocation of live bacteria, bacterial infections and disease progression. The identification of the elements of the gut-liver axis primarily damaged in each chronic liver disease offers possibilities to intervention. Beyond antibiotics, upcoming therapies centered in the gut include new generations of probiotics, bacterial metabolites (postbiotics),  microbial , and carbon nanoparticles. FXR-agonists target both the gut and the liver and are currently being tested in different liver diseases. Finally, synthetic biotic medicines, phages that target specific bacteria or therapies that create physical barriers between the gut and the liver offer new approaches of treatment.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Microbial gut dysbiosis is associated with both AN and SIBO, and therefore gut microbiome changes by serial    (FMT) is a possible therapeutic modality. This study assessed the effects of FMT on gut barrier function,  composition, and the levels of bacterial metabolic products. The patient treatment with FMT led to the improvement of gut barrier function, which was altered prior to FMT. Very low bacterial alpha diversity, a lack of beneficial bacteria, together with a great abundance of fungal species were observed in the patient stool sample before FMT. After FMT, both bacterial species richness and gut microbiome evenness increased in the patient, while the fungal alpha diversity decreased. The total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels (molecules presenting an important source of energy for epithelial gut cells) gradually increased after FMT. Contrarily, one of the most abundant intestinal neurotransmitters, serotonin, tended to decrease throughout the observation period. Overall, gut microbial dysbiosis improvement after FMT was considered. However, there were no signs of patient clinical improvement. The need for an in-depth analysis of the donor´s stool and correct selection pre-FMT is evident.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559298>   as an effective initial therapy for pancreatitis complicated with severe  infection: A case report.</a></h2><p>Moderately severe acute pancreatitis (MSAP) is a critical form of acute pancreatitis that is related with high morbidity and mortality. Severe  infection (sCDI) is a serious and rare nosocomial diarrheal complication, especially in MSAP patients.    (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for refractory and recurrent CDI (rCDI). However, knowledge regarding the initial use of FMT in patients suffering from sCDI is limited.Here, we report an MSAP patient complicated with sCDI who was treated by FMT as a first-line therapy. The patient was a 51-year-old man who suffered from diarrhea in his course of acute pancreatitis. An enzyme immunoassay was performed to detect toxins, and the result was positive for toxin-producing  and toxin B and negative for  ribotype 027. The colonoscopy revealed pseudomembranous colitis. Due to these findings, sCDI was our primary consideration. Because the patient provided informed consent for FMT treatment, we initially treated the patient by FMT rather than metronidazole. Diarrhea resolved within 5 d after FMT. The patient remained asymptomatic, and the follow-up colonoscopy performed 40 d after discharge showed a complete recovery. Our case is the first reported in China.This case explores the possibilities of initially using FMT to treat severe CDI.

Other than a higher relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens such as  and / in all liver recipients, the main difference in gut microbiome composition between liver recipients and HC was the lower relative abundance of beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria in the recipients. Importantly, we established a  microbiome index (specific alterations in  and ) that could be used to distinguish Group LT_A from Group LT_N, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.801 and sensitivity and specificity values of 0.771 and 0.786, respectively.

The influence of the microbiome in drug response has only been investigated in detail for the last 10 years. The human microbiome is a complex and highly dynamic system, which varies dramatically between individuals, yet there exists a common core microbiome that is heritable and can be transmitted to progeny. Here, we review the role of the human microbiome, which is now widely accepted as a major factor that drives the interpersonal variation in therapeutic response. We describe examples in which the microbiome modifies drug action. Despite its complexity, the microbiome can be readily altered, with the potential to increase the benefits and reduce the toxicity and side-effects associated with pharmaceutical drugs. The potential of new microbiome-based strategies, such as    (FMT), probiotics and phage therapy as promising medical therapeutics are outlined. We also suggest a combination reductionist and system-level approaches that could be applied to further investigate the role of  in drug metabolism modulation of drug response.

While it is clear that C. difficile toxins cause damaging colonic inflammation, the immune mechanisms protecting from tissue damage require further investigation. Through a transcriptome analysis, we identify IL-33 as an immune target upregulated in response to hypervirulent C. difficile. We demonstrate that IL-33 prevents C. difficile-associated mortality and epithelial disruption independently of bacterial burden or toxin expression. IL-33 drives colonic group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) activation during infection and IL-33 activated ILC2s are sufficient to prevent disease. Furthermore, intestinal IL-33 expression is regulated by the  as    (FMT) rescues antibiotic-associated depletion of IL-33.

Participants were assigned randomly (1:1) to groups that received FMT by capsules (induction dose of 30 capsules at week 4 and maintenance dose of 12 capsules at week 8) or placebo capsules. FMT capsules were derived from a single lean donor (BMI, 17.5 kg/m). Patients were followed up through week 26; the primary outcome was safety. Stool and serum samples were collected from patients at baseline and at weeks 1, 4, 6, 8, and 12 after administration of the first dose of FMT or placebo and analyzed by 16S RNA gene sequencing. Stool and serum samples were analyzed for metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additional outcomes were the change in area under the curve for GLP1 at week 12.We observed no significant differences in adverse events between patients who received FMT vs placebo. There was no increase in the area under the curve of GLP1 in either group. Patients who received FMT had sustained shifts in microbiomes associated with obesity toward those of the donor (P < .001). Patients who received FMT had a sustained decrease in stool levels of taurocholic acid (P < .05) compared with baseline; bile acid profiles began to resemble those of the donor more closely. We did not observe significant changes in mean BMI at week 12 in either group.In a placebo-controlled pilot study, we found that FMT capsules (derived from a lean donor) were safe but did not reduce BMI in obese metabolically uncompromised patients. The FMT capsules were well tolerated and led to sustained changes in the intestinal microbiome and bile acid profiles that were similar to those of the lean donor.

A    procedure (FMTp), using  extracts from highly feed-efficient pigs, was performed in pregnant sows ( = 11), with a control group ( = 11) receiving no FMTp. At weaning, offspring were allocated, within sow treatment, to (i) control ( = 67; no dietary supplement) or (ii) inulin ( = 65; 6-week dietary inulin supplementation) treatments. The sow FMTp, alone or in combination with inulin supplementation in offspring, reduced offspring body weight by 8.1 to 10.6 kg at ∼140 days of age, but there was no effect on feed intake. It resulted in better FE, greater bacterial diversity, and higher relative abundances of potentially beneficial bacterial taxa ( and ) in offspring. Due to the FMTp and/or inulin supplementation, relative abundances of potential pathogens ( and ) in the ileum and cecal concentrations of butyric acid were significantly lower. The maternal FMTp led to a greater number of jejunal goblet cells in offspring. Inulin supplementation alone did not affect growth or FE but upregulated duodenal genes linked to glucose and volatile fatty acid homeostasis and increased the mean platelet volume but reduced ileal propionic acid concentrations, granulocyte counts, and serum urea concentrations. Overall, the FMTp in pregnant sows, with or without dietary inulin supplementation in offspring, beneficially modulated offspring intestinal  (albeit mostly low-relative-abundance taxa) and associated physiological parameters. Although FE was improved, the detrimental effect on growth limits the application of this FMTp-inulin strategy in commercial pig production. As previous research suggests a link between  and FE, modulation of the intestinal microbiome may be effective in improving FE in pigs. The FMTp in gestating sows, alone or in combination with postweaning dietary inulin supplementation in offspring, achieved improvements in FE and resulted in a higher relative abundance of intestinal bacteria associated with fiber degradation and a lower relative abundance of potential pathogens. However, there was a detrimental effect on growth, although this may not be wholly attributable to  , as antibiotic and other interventions were also part of the FMT regimen. Therefore, further work with additional control groups is needed to disentangle the effects of each component of the FMTp in order to develop a regimen with practical applications in pig production. Additional research based on findings from this study may also identify specific dietary supplements for the promotion/maintenance of the  transferred via the maternal FMTp, thereby optimizing pig growth and FE.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563878>International consensus conference on stool banking for faecal   in clinical practice.</a></h2><p>Although faecal   (FMT) has a well-established role in the treatment of recurrent  infection (CDI), its widespread dissemination is limited by several obstacles, including lack of dedicated centres, difficulties with donor recruitment and complexities related to regulation and safety monitoring.

The gut  (GM) acts by shaping immune tolerance and regulating the Treg number and suppressive function, besides circulating neuropeptides, and other immune cells that play in concert through the gut-brain axis. Previous mouse models have shown an altered enteric flora in early stage ALS, pointing to a possible GM role in ALS pathogenesis.  Microbial  (FMT) is a well-known therapeutic intervention used to re-establish the proper microenvironment and to modulate enteric and systemic immunity.  We are going to perform a multicenter randomized double-blind clinical trial employing FMT as a therapeutic intervention for ALS patients (). Forty-two ALS patients, at an early stage, will be enrolled with a 2:1 allocation ratio (28 FMT-treated patients vs. 14 controls). Study duration will be 12 months per patient. Three endoscopic procedures for intestinal biopsies in FMT and control groups are predicted at baseline, month 6 and month 12; at baseline and at month 6 fresh  from healthy donors will be infused at patients in the intervention arm. The primary outcome is a significant change in Treg number between FMT-treated patients and control arm from baseline to month 6.

Antibiotic treatment puts patients at risk for colonization by opportunistic pathogens like vancomycin resistant Enterococcus and  by destroying the colonization resistance provided by the commensal . Once colonized, the host is at a much higher risk for infection by that pathogen. Furthermore, we know that microbiome community differences are associated with disease states, but we do not have a good understanding of how we can use these changes to classify different patient populations. To that end, we have performed a multicenter retrospective analysis on patients who received    to treat recurrent  infection. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on  samples collected as part of this study and used these data to develop a microbiome disruption index. Our microbiome disruption index is a simple index that is predictive across cohorts, indications, and batch effects. We are able to classify pre-  vs post-  samples in patients with recurrent  infection, and we are able to predict, using previously-published data from a cohort of patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell , which patients would go on to develop bloodstream infections. Finally, we also identified patients in this cohort that were initially colonized with vancomycin resistant Enterococcus and that 92% (11/12) were decolonized after the , but the microbiome disruption index was unable to predict such decolonization. We, however, were able to compare the relative abundance of different taxa between the two groups, and we found that increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae predicts whether patients were colonized with vancomycin resistant Enterococcus.

ALD encompasses a broad spectrum of hepatic injuries including asymptomatic steatosis, alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The susceptibility of alcoholic patients to develop ALD is highly variable and its progression to more advanced stages is strongly influenced by several hits (i.e., amount and duration of alcohol abuse). Among them, the intestinal  and its metabolites have been recently identified as paramount in ALD pathophysiology. Ethanol abuse triggers qualitative and quantitative modifications in intestinal flora taxonomic composition, mucosal inflammation, and intestinal barrier derangement. Intestinal hypermeability results in the translocation of viable pathogenic bacteria, Gram-negative microbial products, and pro-inflammatory luminal metabolites into the bloodstream, further corroborating the alcohol-induced liver damage. Thus, the premise of this review is to discuss the beneficial effect of gut  modulation as a novel therapeutic approach in ALD management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600222>Framework for rational donor selection in    clinical trials.</a></h2><p>Early clinical successes are driving enthusiasm for    (FMT), the transfer of healthy gut bacteria through whole stool, as emerging research is linking the microbiome to many different diseases. However, preliminary trials have yielded mixed results and suggest that heterogeneity in donor stool may play a role in patient response. Thus, clinical trials may fail because an ineffective donor was chosen rather than because FMT is not appropriate for the indication. Here, we describe a conceptual framework to guide rational donor selection to increase the likelihood that FMT clinical trials will succeed. We argue that the mechanism by which the microbiome is hypothesized to be associated with a given indication should inform how healthy donors are selected for FMT trials, categorizing these mechanisms into four disease models and presenting associated donor selection strategies. We next walk through examples based on previously published FMT trials and ongoing investigations to illustrate how donor selection might occur in practice. Finally, we show that typical FMT trials are not powered to discover individual taxa mediating patient responses, suggesting that clinicians should develop targeted hypotheses for retrospective analyses and design their clinical trials accordingly. Moving forward, developing and applying novel clinical trial design methodologies like rational donor selection will be necessary to ensure that FMT successfully translates into clinical impact.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690143>Expert opinion on    for the treatment of  infection and beyond.</a></h2><p>    (FMT) is a procedure involving transfer of stool from a healthy donor into the intestinal tract of a diseased recipient to restore intestinal microbial composition and functionality.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are employed to augment cytotoxic anti-cancer activity by inhibiting negative regulatory elements of the immune system. Modulating the immune system to target neoplasms has improved survivability of numerous cancers in many individuals, but forecasting outcomes post therapy is difficult due to insufficient predictive biomarkers. Recently, the tumor and gastrointestinal microbiome and immune milieu have been investigated as predictors and influencers of cancer immune therapy. In this review, we discuss: (1) ways to measure the microbiome including relevant bioinformatic analyses, (2) recent developments in animal studies and human clinical trials utilizing gut microbial composition and function as biomarkers of cancer immune therapy response and toxicity, and (3) using prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, antibiotics, and    (FMT) to modulate immune therapy. We discuss the respective benefits of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing including important considerations in obtaining samples and in designing and interpreting human and animal microbiome studies. We then focus on studies discussing the differences in response to ICIs in relation to the microbiome and inflammatory mediators. ICIs cause colitis in up to 25% of individuals, and colitis is often refractory to common immunosuppressive medications. Researchers have measured  composition prior to ICI therapy and correlated baseline  composition with efficacy and colitis. Certain bacterial taxa that appear to enhance therapeutic benefit are also implicated in increased susceptibility to colitis, alluding to a delicate balance between pro-inflammatory tumor killing and anti-inflammatory protection from colitis. Pre-clinical and clinical models have trialed probiotic administration, e.g.  or FMT, to treat colitis when immune suppressive agents fail. We are excited about the future of modulating the microbiome to predict and influence cancer outcomes. Furthermore, novel therapies employed for other illnesses including bacteriophage and genetically-engineered microbes can be adapted in the future to promote increased advancements in cancer treatment and side effect management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31239866>Roles of Chinese Medicine and Gut  in Chronic Constipation.</a></h2><p>Chronic constipation is a common gastrointestinal dysfunction, but its aetiology and pathogenesis are still unclear.

Antitumor effect of the combination therapy was evaluated by tumor volume, histological staining of tumor tissues. Furthermore, flow cytometry was performed to analyze the alteration of immune microenvironment in tumor bed after treatment. The suppressing effect of the combination therapy on tumor invasiveness and metastasis was evaluated in both mice and zebrafish xenografts models.  sample 16S rRNA gene sequencing was conducted to analyze changes of intestinal microbial diversity. The effect of intestinal  on tumor suppression after receiving EcN was further tested by  . : The therapeutic outcomes in tumor growth inhibition and metastasis suppression of Gal were significantly potentiated by EcN, resulting from the strengthened antitumor immunity. EcN was able to relieve the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which was evidenced by enhanced tumor-specific effector T cells infiltration and dendritic cells activation. Intestinal  was modulated by EcN, illustrated by a shift of gut microbiome toward certain beneficial bacteria. : These results suggested that Gal combined with EcN might be a novel therapeutic approach with great potential of clinical implications for cancer prevention or treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31367877>   via Endoscopic Delivering Through Small Intestine and Colon: No Difference for Crohn's Disease.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder associated with intestinal dysbiosis.

Here, we dissect the role of the tumor  and the immune system in influencing long-term survival. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed the tumor microbiome composition in PDAC patients with short-term survival (STS) and long-term survival (LTS). We found higher alpha-diversity in the tumor microbiome of LTS patients and identified an intra-tumoral microbiome signature (Pseudoxanthomonas-Streptomyces-Saccharopolyspora-Bacillus clausii) highly predictive of long-term survivorship in both discovery and validation cohorts. Through human-into-mice    (FMT) experiments from STS, LTS, or control donors, we were able to differentially modulate the tumor microbiome and affect tumor growth as well as tumor immune infiltration. Our study demonstrates that PDAC microbiome composition, which cross-talks to the gut microbiome, influences the host immune response and natural history of the disease.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594178>[Fecal microbiota transplantation as a novel therapy for severe psoriasis].</a></h2><p>To explore the therapeutic effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for severe psoriasis.

As several findings suggested a role for the lysosomal lipid transporter Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) in macrophages during MetS, we here explored whether a hematopoietic Npc1 mutation, induced via bone marrow , influences gut  composition in low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (Ldlr) mice fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFC) diet for 12 weeks. Ldlr mice fed a HFC diet mimic a human plasma lipoprotein profile and show features of MetS, providing a model to explore the role of host genetics on gut  under MetS conditions.  samples were used to profile the microbial composition by 16 s ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The hematopoietic Npc1 mutation shifted the gut  composition and increased microbial richness and diversity.

Here, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of action of a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-k30)-based solid dispersion of Zn(II)-curcumin (ZnCM-SD) against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro and in vivo. In vitro assays revealed ZnCM-SD not only reduced the viability of HepG2 cells and SK-HEP1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, but also potently and synergistically enhanced cell growth inhibition and cell death in response to doxorubicin by regulating cellular zinc homeostasis. ZnCM-SD was internalized into the cells via non-specific endocytosis and degraded to release curcumin and Zn ions within cells. The anticancer effects also occur in vivo in animals following the oral administration of ZnCM-SD, without significantly affecting the weight of the animals. Interestingly, ZnCM-SD did not reduce tumor growth or affect zinc homeostasis in HepG2-bearing mice after gut microbiome depletion.

However, little progress has been made in determining the exact function of NHP on tumorigenesis. In the current study, we found that NHP inhibited colorectal tumorigenesis in the APC  transgenic mouse model, as well as induced apoptosis and blocked angiogenesis in vivo. Our in-cell study suggested that this tumorigenic preventative effect of NHP is not due to the direct impact on tumor cells. Intriguingly, by utilizing 16 s rRNA gene-based  sequencing, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased, while Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were increased in the presence of NHP. Additionally, the    experiment further revealed that feeding with  of NHP-treated mice induced considerable inhibition of tumorigenesis, which indicates that the alteration of gut  is responsible for NHP-mediated prevention of colorectal tumorigenesis.

We sought to determine whether putative procarcinogenic bacteria (enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Escherichia coli harboring the colibactin toxin) could be durably transmitted from donors to patients during FMT.METHODSStool samples were collected from 11 pediatric rCDI patients and their respective FMT donors prior to FMT as well as from the patients at 2-10 weeks, 10-20 weeks, and 6 months after FMT. Bacterial virulence factors in stool DNA extracts and stool cultures were measured by quantitative PCR: Bacteroides fragilis toxin (bft), Fusobacterium adhesin A (fadA), and Escherichia coli colibactin (clbB).RESULTSFour of 11 patients demonstrated sustained acquisition of a procarcinogenic bacteria. Whole genome sequencing was performed on colony isolates from one of these donor/recipient pairs and demonstrated that clbB+ E. coli strains present in the recipient after FMT were identical to a strain present in the donor, confirming strain transmission. Conversely, 2 patients exhibited clearance of procarcinogenic bacteria following FMT from a negative donor.CONCLUSIONBoth durable transmission and clearance of procarcinogenic bacteria occurred following FMT, suggesting that additional studies on appropriate screening measures for FMT donors and the long-term consequences and/or benefits of FMT are warranted.FUNDINGCrohn's & Colitis Foundation, the Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the National Cancer Institute, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302141>Reply.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396536>Xiao-Qing-Long Tang Prevents Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy, Fibrosis, and the Development of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Faction in Rats by Modulating the Composition of the Gut .</a></h2><p>Changes in the gut  are associated with cardiovascular disease progression.

The current study studied the role of gut  in cell- and antibody-mediated immune responses to vaccination with a whole inactivated avian influenza virus, subtype H9N2. A total of 166 one-day-old specific pathogen free layer chickens (SPF) were randomly assigned to treatments, where a combination of antibiotic depletion, and probiotics (a combination of five Lactobacillus species) or  microbial  (FMT) reconstitution were used to study the dynamics of cell- and antibody-mediated immune responses to primary and secondary vaccinations at days 15 and 29 of age, respectively. Overall, at days 7 and 14 post primary vaccination (p.p.v.), administration of probiotics to non-depleted chickens resulted in significantly higher mean hemagglutination (HI) titre compared to antibiotic treated chickens. Furthermore, at day 21 p.p.v., chickens treated with probiotics or FMT post-antibiotic treatment showed a significantly higher mean HI titre compared to non-depleted chickens treated with probiotics. At day 7 p.p.v., a significantly higher virus specific IgM and IgG titres were observed in non-depleted chickens administered with probiotics compared to antibiotic depleted chickens, and a significantly higher IgG titre was observed in chickens treated with FMT following antibiotic treatment compared to only antibiotic treatment. Analysis of interferon gamma expression in splenocytes to assess cell-mediated immune responses showed a significantly lower expression in antibiotic-treated chickens compared to non-depleted chickens and FMT reconstituted chickens. Taken together, the current study suggests that shifts in the composition of gut  of chickens may result in changes in cell- and antibody-mediated immune responses to vaccination against influenza viruses. Further studies will be needed to highlight the mechanisms involved in this modulation.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, we aimed to unravel the role of both intestinal barrier integrity and  in NAFLD/NASH development.C57BL/6J mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or methionine-choline-deficient diet for 1 week or longer to recapitulate aspects of NASH (steatosis, inflammation, insulin resistance). Genetic and pharmacological strategies were then used to modulate intestinal barrier integrity.We show that disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and gut vascular barrier (GVB) are early events in NASH pathogenesis. Mice fed HFD for only 1 week undergo a diet-induced dysbiosis that drives GVB damage and bacterial translocation into the liver.    from HFD-fed mice into specific pathogen-free recipients induces GVB damage and epididymal adipose tissue enlargement. GVB disruption depends on interference with the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, as shown by genetic intervention driving β-catenin activation only in endothelial cells, preventing GVB disruption and NASH development. The bile acid analogue and farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) drives β-catenin activation in endothelial cells. Accordingly, pharmacologic intervention with OCA protects against GVB disruption, both as a preventive and therapeutic agent. Importantly, we found upregulation of the GVB leakage marker in the colon of patients with NASH.We have identified a new player in NASH development, the GVB, whose damage leads to bacteria or bacterial product translocation into the blood circulation. Treatment aimed at restoring β-catenin activation in endothelial cells, such as administration of OCA, protects against GVB damage and NASH development.The incidence of fatty liver disease is reaching epidemic levels in the USA, with more than 30% of adults having NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), which can progress to more severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Herein, we show that disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and gut vascular barrier are early events in the development of NASH. We show that the drug obeticholic acid protects against barrier disruption and thereby prevents the development of NASH, providing further evidence for its use in the prevention or treatment of NASH.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

To address this issue, we evaluated the effects of synbiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics on tumorigenesis using a CDX2P-Cre; Apc+/flox mouse model harboring a colon-specific Apc knock out, which develops adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the colon. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-administration promoted colonic tumor development in CDX2P-Cre; Apc+/flox mice, and these tumors were associated with loss of Apc heterozygosity, as confirmed by observation of well-differentiated adenocarcinomas with β-catenin accumulation in tumor cell cytoplasm. Synbiotics-treatment suppressed dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in CDX2P-Cre; Apc+/flox mice, thereby reducing mortality, and inhibited tumorigenesis accelerated by DSS-administration. Conversely, neither probiotics nor prebiotics had any effect on inflammation and tumorigenesis. Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium breve were detected in the   of probiotics-treated mice. Synbiotics-treatment suppressed DSS-induced expression of IL-6, STAT-3, COX-2, and TNF-α gene transcripts in normal colonic epithelium, indicating the possibility of suppressing tumor development.

The objective of FMT is to re-establish a healthy and diverse gut microbial environment, and FMT has been used in patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). From 2009 to 2015, over 20,623 adult patients were reported to have Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), according to the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program. Approximately 233,000 Canadians are living with IBD, and an estimated 18% of Canadians are living with IBS. FMT is used with the aim of fostering a healthy microbial environment in the gastrointestinal tract in these populations. FMT may be administered via different preparations. Lyophilized FMT is prepared by freezing a filtered stool sample solution from a healthy donor, then freeze drying the sample through sublimation to a powder form. It can be administered orally and through colonoscopy. In contrast, frozen FMT treatment involves freezing filtered stool samples at −80°C, thawing prior to administration, then administrating orally, by enema or via colonscopy. It is suggested that lyophilized FMT is easier to store (e.g., at standard refrigerator temperature of 4°C) and that the powder material is easier to encapsulate.

Lipid peroxidation procedurally appears, ferroptosis, apoptosis and necrosis are often induced, subsequently, mitochondrial damage, endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction and even cell death occur. As a result, the intestinal epithelial cells are destroyed, leading to the incompleteness of intestinal mechanical barrier. Simultaneously, iron supplement can change the compositions and metabolic processes of intestinal microbes, and the intestinal inflammatory may be worsened. In principle, the easier dissociation of Fe from oral iron supplements is, the more serious intestinal inflammation will occur. Fortunately, some interventions have been developed to alleviate these side effects. For instance, some antioxidants e.g. VE and ferulic acid have been used to prevent the formation of free radicals or to neutralize the formed free radicals. Furthermore, some new iron supplements with the ability of slow-releasing Fe, e.g. ferrous citrate liposome and EDTA iron sodium, have been successfully prepared. In order to recover the intestinal micro-ecological balance, probiotics and prebiotics, bacterial consortium , and    have been developed. This study is meaningful for us to develop safer oral iron supplements and to maintain intestinal micro-ecological health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596218>Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Systemic Hypertension: Gut  as the Mediator?</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and systemic hypertension (SH) are common and interrelated diseases. It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut , OSA and gut , and whether gut  is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut ." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut . Gut , however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut  seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut  at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH.

So far no NWM exists concerning therapeutic interventions for recurrent CDI (rCDI).In this NWM we assessed the comparative effectiveness of various therapies for rCDI to examine the efficacy rank order and determine the optimum therapeutic approach.A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to investigate the efficacy rank order of rCDI interventions.Six eligible RCTs were entered into an NWM. They included 348 rCDI patients, in whom seven therapeutic interventions were used, i.e. donor    (DFMT), vancomycin, fidaxomicin, vancomycin + DFMT, vancomycin + bowel lavage, autologous FMT and placebo. DFMT showed the highest efficacy in comparison with vancomycin [odds ratio (95% credible interval), 20.02 (7.05-70.03)] and fidaxomicin (22.01 (4.38-109.63)).This NWM showed that DFMT is the optimum therapeutic approach for rCDI, as it was the most efficacious among various therapeutic interventions, particularly in comparison with commonly used antibiotics such as vancomycin or fidaxomicin.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269444>-Driven Tonic Interferon Signals in Lung Stromal Cells Protect from Influenza Virus Infection.</a></h2><p>Type I interferon (IFNα/β) pathways are fine-tuned to elicit antiviral protection while minimizing immunopathology; however, the initiating stimuli, target tissues, and underlying mechanisms are unclear. Using models of physiological and dysregulated IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR1) surface expression, we show here that IFNAR1-dependent signals set the steady-state IFN signature in both hematopoietic and stromal cells. Increased IFNAR1 levels promote a lung environment refractory to early influenza virus replication by elevating the baseline interferon signature. Commensal  drive the IFN signature specifically in lung stroma, as shown by antibiotic treatment and  . Bone marrow chimera experiments identify lung stromal cells as crucially important for early antiviral immunity and stroma-immune cell interaction for late antiviral resistance. We propose that the -driven interferon signature in lung epithelia impedes early virus replication and that IFNAR1 surface levels fine-tune this signature.

The gut /gut hormone axis has recently received increasing attention. However, the relationship between the gut  and melatonin receptors has not yet been evaluated. We aimed to determine the effect of the gut  on colonic melatonin receptor expression in germ-free (GF) rats and to further explore the potential mechanism in Caco-2 cells. In this study, GF rats were transplanted with  samples from a healthy human donor. Subsequently, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to analyze the microbial communities. Colon tissue was collected for immunohistochemical analysis. The correlations between melatonin receptor expression and the gut  were assessed. Melatonin receptor expression in Caco-2 cells was detected by Western blot. We found that    significantly increased the expression of colonic melatonin receptors in GF rats. The amount of  Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was significantly higher in    (FMT) rats than in GF rats. SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Alistipes and Blautia, were positively correlated with colonic melatonin receptor expression in FMT rats. Additionally, acetate and propionate significantly increased melatonin receptor-1 expression in Caco-2 cells. Therefore, the gut  may promote melatonin receptor expression, and the mechanism may involve the action of SCFAs.

We assessed the benefits of a multidisciplinary  clinic for screening FMT eligibility in patients with rCDI. Patients seen at the University of Virginia Complicated  Clinic (CCDC) underwent comprehensive evaluation for possible FMT. Patients were eligible for FMT if there was history of greater than two episodes of rCDI. Patients were evaluated for the outcome after evaluation in the clinic. A total of 113 patients were evaluated: 77 were eligible for FMT, of which 25 patients did not undergo FMT. The rate of recurrence at three months and all-cause mortality were 4.5% and 7% for patients who received FMT and 16.7% and 12.5% for eligible patients who did not receive FMT. There were 36 patients who were not eligible for FMT, with two or fewer recurrences and a recurrence rate of 8.8% and all-cause mortality of 6%. One in three patients screened for FMT had a nutritional deficiency diagnosed, with zinc deficiency being most common (20%). Additional diagnoses, including inflammatory bowel disease, were made during the evaluation. FMT is a highly effective treatment for rCDI, most notably in patients with multiple recurrences.

The sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in  samples demonstrated that XAN reversed gut  dysbiosis in AD animals. XAN could change the relative abundances of several phyla and genus of bacterial, particularly the ratio of . Among them, , , , and  had been reported to be involved in the pathologic developments of AD and other central nervous system disease. In metabolomics study, a series of host endogenous metabolites were detected, including amino acids, lysophosphatidylcholine, dihydrosphingosine, phytosphingosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine, which were all closely associated with the development of AD. Combined with the Spearman's correlation analysis, it was confirmed that the increases of five bacterial strains and decreases of six bacterial strains were closely correlated with the increases of nine host metabolites and the decreases of another five host metabolites. Therefore, XAN can modulate the structure of gut  in AD rats; the changes of gut  were significantly correlated with endogenous metabolites, and symptom of AD was ultimately alleviated.

This study investigated the effect of the administration of FMT from highly feed efficient donors early in life on the jejunal and cecal , visceral organ size, intestinal morphology, permeability, and expression of genes for nutrient transporters, barrier function and innate immune response in chickens of diverging residual feed intake (RFI; a metric for FE). Chicks ( = 110) were inoculated with the FMT or control  (CT) on 1, 6, and 9 days posthatch (dph), from which 56 chickens were selected on 30 dph as the extremes in RFI, resulting in 15 low and 13 high RFI chickens receiving the FMT and 14 low and 14 high RFI chickens receiving the CT. RFI rank and FMT only caused tendencies for alterations in the jejunal  and only one unclassified  genus in cecal digesta was indicative of high RFI. By contrast, the FMT caused clear differences in the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profile in the crop and cecal  composition compared to the CT, which indicated alterations in amylolytic, pullulanolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria such as , , and . Moreover, the FMT caused alterations in intestinal development as indicated by the longer duodenum and shallower crypts in the ceca. From the observed RFI-associated variation, energy-saving mechanisms and moderation of the mucosal immune response were indicated by higher jejunal permeability, shorter villi in the ileum, and enhanced cecal expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine  in low RFI chickens. Relationships obtained from supervised multigroup data integration support that certain bacteria, including , and unclassified -phylotypes, and SCFA in jejunal and cecal digesta modulated expression levels of cytokines, tight-junction protein  and nutrient transporters for glucose and SCFA uptake. In conclusion, results suggest that the intestine only played a moderate role for the RFI-associated variation of the present low and high RFI phenotypes, whereas modulating the early microbial colonization resulted in long-lasting changes in bacterial taxonomic and metabolite composition as well as in host intestinal development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383855>   alleviated Alzheimer's disease-like pathogenesis in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia in the elderly.

Over the last decade, growing evidence has identified the gut  as a potential factor in the pathophysiology of both obesity and the related metabolic disorders. The gut  is known to protect gastrointestinal mucosa permeability and to regulate the fermentation and absorption of dietary polysaccharides, perhaps explaining its importance in the regulation of fat accumulation and the resultant obesity. The proposed mechanisms by which the gut  could contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and the related metabolic diseases include: (a) a high abundance of bacteria that ferment carbohydrates, leading to increased rates of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) biosynthesis, providing an extra source of energy for the host, that is eventually stored as lipids or glucose; (b) increased intestinal permeability to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), resulting in elevated systemic LPS levels that aggravate low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance; (c) increased activity of the gut endocannabinoid system.   studies in germ-free mice have provided crucial insights into the potential causative role of the gut  in the development of obesity and obesity-related disorders.

All  samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut  composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we performed a    to disentangle the contribution of the gut  and host genetics as drivers of resistance to the intestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus. We transplanted the  of a strain of mice (SJL), resistant to H. polygyrus, into a susceptible strain (CBA) and vice-versa. We predicted that if the  shapes resistance to H. polygyrus, the FMT should reverse the pattern of resistance between the two host strains. The two host strains had different  diversities and compositions before the start of the experiment, and the FMT altered the  of recipient mice. One mouse strain (SJL) was more resistant to colonization by the heterologous , and it maintained its resistance profile to H. polygyrus (lower parasite burden) independently of the FMT. On the contrary, CBA mice harbored parasites with lower fecundity during the early stage of the infection, and had an up-regulated expression of the cytokine IL-4 (a marker of H. polygyrus resistance) after receiving the heterologous . Therefore, while host genetics remains the main factor shaping the pattern of resistance to H. polygyrus, the composition of the gut  also seems to play a strain-specific role.Copyright © 2019 Australian Society for Parasitology.

Alterations of bile acid metabolism and gut  have been reported to play vital roles in intestinal carcinogenesis. About trillions of bacteria have inhabited in the human gut and maintained the balance of host metabolism. Bile acids are one of numerous metabolites that are synthesized in the liver and further metabolized by the gut , and are essential in maintaining the normal gut  and lipid digestion. Multiple receptors such as FXR, GPBAR1, PXR, CAR and VDR act as sensors of bile acids have been reported. In this review, we mainly discussed interplay between bile acid metabolism and gut  in intestinal carcinogenesis. We then summarized the critical role of bile acids receptors involving in CRC, and also addressed the rationale of multiple interventions for CRC management by regulating bile acids- axis such as probiotics, metformin, ursodeoxycholic acid and   . Thus, by targeting the bile acids- axis may provide novel therapeutic modalities in CRC prevention and treatment.© 2019 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31326608>Gut Colonization Preceding Mucosal Barrier Injury Bloodstream Infection in Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell  Recipients.</a></h2><p>The gastrointestinal tract is the predicted reservoir for most bloodstream infections (BSIs) after hematopoietic stem cell  (HSCT). Whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomics have the potential to improve our understanding of the dynamics of gut colonization that precede BSI in HSCT recipients. Within a prospective cohort study of children (age <18 years) undergoing HSCT, 9 subjects met criteria for mucosal barrier injury BSI. We performed whole-genome sequencing of the blood culture isolate and weekly  samples preceding the BSI to compare the genetic similarity of BSI isolates to  strains. We evaluated temporal associations between antibiotic exposures and the abundances of BSI strains in the gut  and correlated the detection of antibiotic resistance genes with the phenotypic antibiotic resistance of these strains. The median patient age was 2.6 years, and 78% were male. BSIs were caused by Escherichia coli (n = 5), Enterococcus faecium (n = 2), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), and Rothia mucilaginosa (n = 1). In the 6 BSI episodes with evaluable comparative genomics, the  strains were identical to the blood culture isolate (>99.99% genetic similarity). Gut domination by these strains preceded only 4 of 7 E. coli or E. faecium BSIs by a median of 17 days (range, 6 to 21 days). Increasing abundances of the resulting BSI strains in the gut  were frequently associated with specific antibiotic exposures. E. cloacae and R. mucilaginosa were not highly abundant in  samples preceding BSIs caused by these species. The detection of antibiotic resistance genes for β-lactam antibiotics and vancomycin predicted phenotypic resistance in BSI strains. Bacterial strains causing mucosal barrier injury BSI in pediatric HSCT recipients were observed in the gut  before BSI onset, and changes in the abundances of these strains within the gut preceded most BSI episodes. However, frequent sampling of the gut  and sampling of other ecological niches is likely necessary to effectively predict BSI in HSCT recipients.Copyright © 2019 American Society for  and Cellular Therapy.

Modification of gut  and repression of BA synthesis are potential strategies for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and to understand the mechanisms of the probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), on hepatic bile acid synthesis, liver injury and fibrosis in bile-duct ligation (BDL) and Mdr2 mice. Global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors were used to dissect the role of FXR. LGG treatment significantly attenuated liver inflammation, injury and fibrosis with a significant reduction of hepatic BAs in BDL mice. Hepatic concentration of T-βMCA, an FXR antagonist, was markedly increased in BDL mice and reduced in LGG-treated mice, while chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), an FXR agonist, was decreased in BDL mice and normalized in LGG-treated mice. LGG treatment significantly increased the expression of serum and ileum FGF15 and subsequently reduced hepatic CYP7A1 and BA synthesis in BDL and Mdr2 mice. At the molecular level, these changes were reversed by global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors in BDL mice. In addition, LGG treatment altered gut , which was associated with increased BA de-conjugation and increased  and urine BA excretion both in BDL and Mdr2 mice. In vitro studies showed that LGG suppressed the inhibitory effect of T-βMCA on FXR and FGF19 expression in Caco-2 cells. Conclusion: LGG supplementation decreases hepatic BA by increasing intestinal FXR/FGF15 signaling pathway-mediated suppression of BA de novo synthesis and enhances BA excretion, which prevents excessive BA-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mice.© 2019 The Authors.

The effects of diet seem to be a result of an interaction with the gut bacteria and the gut endocrine cells. The density of gut endocrine cells is low in IBS patients, and it is believed that this abnormality is the direct cause of the symptoms seen in IBS patients. The low density of gut endocrine cells is probably caused by a low number of stem cells and low differentiation progeny toward endocrine cells. A low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharide, and polyol (FODMAP) diet and    (FMT) restore the gut endocrine cells to the level of healthy subjects. It has been suggested that our diet acts as a prebiotic that favors the growth of a certain types of bacteria. Diet also acts as a substrate for gut bacteria fermentation, which results in several by-products. These by-products might act on the stem cells in such a way that the gut stem cells decrease, and consequently, endocrine cell numbers decrease. Changing to a low-FODMAP diet or changing the gut bacteria through FMT improves IBS symptoms and restores the density of endocrine cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31369420>Prevention and treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection.</a></h2><p>Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a significant burden on the health system, especially due to high recurrence rates. Since the beginning of the CDI epidemic in early 2000s, many strategies for combatting recurrence have been explored, with moderate success so far. This review will focus on the most recent developments in recurrent CDI prevention and treatment.There are two main mechanisms of CDI recurrence: alteration in microbiome and poor antibody response. Development of new antibiotics aims to minimize damage to the microbiome.   or other microbiome replacement therapies seek to replenish the missing elements in the microbiome.    is the most effective treatment for prevention of CDI recurrenceso far, but is difficult to standardize and regulate, leading to efforts to develop microbiome-derived therapeutics. A deficiency in developing antibodies to C. difficile toxins is another mechanism of recurrence. Active immunization using toxoid vaccines or passive immunization using mAbs address this aspect.There are promising new treatments for recurrent CDI in development.    remains the most effective therapy for multiply recurrent CDI.

However, it is inappropriate to neglect the impact of host factors on shaping the gut . In this review, we highlighted the current findings of the host factors that could modulate the gut . Particularly the epithelium-associated factors, including the innate immune sensors, anti-microbial peptides, mucus barrier, secretory IgAs, epithelial microvilli, epithelial tight junctions, epithelium metabolism, oxygen barrier, and even the microRNAs are discussed in the context of the  shaping.

Our study describes retrospective cohort treated with FMT at two major hospitals in Stockholm.Medical records of all patients with recurrent CDI treated with FMT during the period 2013-2017 were reviewed. We evaluated cure of CDI-related diarrhea without relapse 10 weeks after FMT.47 patients were included. One treatment cured 25 patients (53%), and more than one treatment cured 32 patients (68%). Treatment outcome did not vary significantly with treatment with fresh donor  or frozen  culture, days of use of antibiotics or days of hospitalization prior to CDI, and renal function or time from the first CDI to therapy. Treatment failure was associated with a significantly lower Karnofsky performance status score (70 points vs 90, =0.02). instillation, for the treatment of relapsing CDI, is a promising approach, with 68% success rate reported in this study.

Tetracycline resistance genes increased post-FMT ( < .001). Very low levels of potential pathogens were identified in donors and recipients, with an overall decrease post-FMT ( < .001).  sp. 109 expanded in all recipients post-FMT, and no recipients had any clinical infection.

Emerging evidence indicates that the gut microbiome plays a key role in maintaining immune system homeostasis. This work reports that MG is characterized by decreased α-phylogenetic diversity, and significantly disturbed gut microbiome and  metabolome. The altered gut microbial composition is associated with  metabolome changes, with 38.75% of altered bacterial operational taxonomic units showing significant correlations with a range of metabolite biomarkers. Some microbes are particularly linked with MG severity. Moreover, a combination of microbial makers and their correlated metabolites enable discriminating MG from healthy controls (HCs) with 100% accuracy. To investigate whether disturbed gut mcirobiome might contribute to the onset of MG, germ-free (GF) mice are initially colonized with MG  (MMb) or healthy  (HMb), and then immunized in a classic mouse model of MG. The MMb mice demonstrate substantially impaired locomotion ability compared with the HMb mice. This effect could be reversed by cocolonizing GF mice with both MMb and HMb.

Of the 2,010 patients, 797 were male and 1,213 were female, with a mean age of (49.4±16.5) years old. Inclusion criteria were those with indications for FMT and voluntary treatment of FMT. Pregnant or lactating women, patients with end-stage disease, cases who were participating or participated in other clinical trials within 3 months, and patients with previous bowel history of pathogen infection, oral antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the recent2 weeks, and those at immunosuppressive state were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from the enrolled patients and their families. There were 1,356 cases of constipation, 175 cases of inflammatory bowel disease, 148 cases of chronic diarrhea, 127 cases of radiation enteritis, 119 cases of irritable bowel syndrome, and 85 cases of autism (complicating with intestinal disorders). FMT donor requirements: (1) 18 to 30 years old non-relatives, non-pregnant healthy adults with healthy lifestyle and good eating habits as volunteers to participate in  donation; (2) no administration of antibiotics within 3 months; (3) no chronic diseases such as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, etc., no autoimmune disease, not in immunosuppressive state, no history of malignant disease; (4) negative pathogen examination of infectious diseases (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, HIV, etc.); (5) negative  examination (C.difficile, dysentery bacillus, Shigella, Campylobacter, parasites, etc.).

Although initial results with FMT in patients with active UC are encouraging, data regarding its acceptability, tolerability, and safety are scant.A retrospective analysis of patients with active UC (Mayo clinic score ≥ 4), who received multisession FMT (at weeks 0, 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22) via colonoscopy between June 2016 and June 2018, was performed. Patient acceptability, tolerability, and immediate and long-term safety of the therapy were assessed.Of the 129 patients with active UC who were offered FMT, 101 patients consented, giving acceptability of 78.3%.  slurry retention time improved with each session (3.27 ± 1.06 h for the first session vs 5.12 ± 0.5 h for the seventh session). Abdominal discomfort, flatulence, abdominal distension, borborygmi, and low-grade fever (30.8%, 15.9%, 9.8%, 7.9%, and 7.6%, respectively) were the most common post-procedural short-term adverse events.

Phages are bacteria-specific viruses that are gaining attention as highly influential regulators of the gut bacterial community. Dysregulation of the gut bacterial community contributes to dysbiosis, a microbiome disorder characterized by compositional and functional changes that contribute to disease. A role for phages in gut microbiome dysbiosis is emerging with evidence that the gut phage community is altered in dysbiosis-associated disorders such as colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. Several recent studies have linked successful    to uptake of the donor's gut phage community, offering some insight into why some recipients respond to treatment whereas others do not.

Frequent recurrences have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, high healthcare costs, and lower quality of life. In this review, we compare the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent rCDI. We performed a systematic review of the English literature, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated rCDI as an outcome. Studies were included irrespective of patient demographics, disease severity, type of intervention, comparator used, or time-point of outcome evaluation. We performed a comprehensive literature search with the assistance of a research librarian. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Our search yielded 38 RCTs (8,102 participants). Nineteen RCTs (3,743 subjects) evaluated antibiotics, eight    (FMT) (582 subjects), three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (2,805 subjects), and eight probiotics, prebiotics, or non-antibiotic polymers (972 subjects). The antibiotic and FMT therapies that demonstrated efficacy in rCDI prevention included: fidaxomicin (when compared to a ten-day vancomycin course) and FMT administered by nasogastric tube (when compared to a fourteen-day vancomycin course and a fourteen-day vancomycin course plus bowel lavage). Actoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin A; CDA1) plus bezlotoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin B; CDB1) in combination or bezlotoxumab alone appeared to be more effective in preventing rCDI compared to actoxumab alone. Of the prebiotics, probiotics, and nonantibiotic polymers, oligofructose, Saccharomyces boulardii, and the nontoxigenic C. difficile strain M3 were the most efficacious for rCDI prevention. Thirty-eight RCTs (>8,000 participants) evaluating treatment modalities for CDI were examined for efficacy in prevention of rCDI. Several CDI-specific antibiotics, FMT modalities, monoclonal antibodies, and various prebiotics and probiotics demonstrated a reduction in risk of rCDI with the greatest risk reduction observed with FMT and monoclonal antibody therapy. It is notable that the comparators in these studies were very different from one another and the relative risk reduction of rCDI may not be directly comparable from one study to the next.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The treatment of IBD has evolved with the development of tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors beyond the conventional therapies. In spite of their long-term effectiveness, many patients do not respond to or cannot sustain treatment with these drugs, which have various side effects. Therefore, the development of new drugs targeting specific pathways in the pathogenesis of IBD has become necessary. Some novel biologics and small molecule drugs have shown potential in IBD clinical trials, providing safe and effective results. In addition, clinicians are now trying to target the dysbiotic microbiome of patients with IBD using   . New tools such as stem cells have also been developed.

Despite a strong influence of the intestinal  on AD, the causal relationship between the gut  and AD pathophysiology is still elusive.Using a recently developed AD-like pathology with amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles (ADLP) transgenic mouse model of AD, which shows amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and reactive gliosis in their brains along with memory deficits, we examined the impact of the gut  on AD pathogenesis.Composition of the gut  in ADLP mice differed from that of healthy wild-type (WT) mice. Besides, ADLP mice showed a loss of epithelial barrier integrity and chronic intestinal and systemic inflammation. Both frequent transfer and  of the faecal  from WT mice into ADLP mice ameliorated the formation of amyloid β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, glial reactivity and cognitive impairment. Additionally, the faecal  transfer reversed abnormalities in the colonic expression of genes related to intestinal macrophage activity and the circulating blood inflammatory monocytes in the ADLP recipient mice.These results indicate that -mediated intestinal and systemic immune aberrations contribute to the pathogenesis of AD in ADLP mice, providing new insights into the relationship between the gut (colonic gene expression, gut permeability), blood (blood immune cell population) and brain (pathology) axis and AD (memory deficits).

In addition to developing new antibiotics and stopping transmission, recent research has focused on 'decolonization' strategies to eradicate the carriage of ESBL-E/CPE before infection occurs. : In this narrative review, we aim to describe the current evidence of decolonization strategies for ESBL-E or CPE intestinal carriage.

A series of recent studies have shown that the microbiome influences the central nervous system in various ways, and consequently acts on the psychological well-being of the individual by mediating, among others, the reactions of stress and anxiety. From a specifically neuroethical point of view, according to some scholars, the particular composition of the microbiome-qua microbial community-can have consequences on the traditional idea of human individuality. Another neuroethical aspect concerns the reception of this new knowledge in relation to clinical applications. In fact, attention to the balance of the microbiome-which includes eating behavior, the use of psychobiotics and, in the treatment of certain diseases, the use of   -may be limited or even prevented by a biased negative attitude. This attitude derives from a prejudice related to everything that has to do with the organic processing of food and, in general, with the human stomach and intestine: the latter have traditionally been regarded as low, dirty, contaminated and opposed to what belongs to the mind and the brain. This biased attitude can lead one to fail to adequately consider the new anthropological conceptions related to the microbiome, resulting in a state of health, both physical and psychological, inferior to what one might have by paying the right attention to the knowledge available today. Shifting from the ubiquitous high-low metaphor (which is synonymous with superior-inferior) to an inside-outside metaphor can thus be a neuroethical strategy to achieve a new and unbiased reception of the discoveries related to the microbiome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293562>Analysis of the Relationship Between the Degree of Dysbiosis in Gut  and Prognosis at Different Stages of Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Gut  dysbiosis is closely associated with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

With growing indications and widespread use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, it is imperative to summarize the current body of evidence concerning the incidence, pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnostic challenges, and treatment options currently available for the management of immune-mediated diarrhea and colitis. Additionally, with emerging evidence analyzing the resumption of immune checkpoint inhibitors, it is pivotal to summarize our current understanding and future challenges.Immune-mediated diarrhea and colitis can potentially be a viable surrogate marker for improved survival as it is validated further in large-scale studies. Early endoscopic evaluation can aid in the identification of patients at risk of developing steroid refractory immune-mediated colitis, and hence can be chosen to receive early add-on therapy with infliximab, vedolizumab or   , an emerging treatment option for immune-mediated diarrhea and colitis.

The aim of this study is to determine the effect of colonization using human donors in germ-free (GF) mice on the gut-liver-brain axis. GF and conventional mice were made cirrhotic using carbon tetrachloride and compared with controls in GF and conventional state. Additional GF mice were colonized with stool from controls (Ctrl-Hum) and patients with cirrhosis (Cirr-Hum). Stools from patients with HE cirrhosis after antibiotics were pooled (pre-FMT). Stools from the same patients 15 days after FMT from a healthy donor were also pooled (post-FMT). Sterile supernatants were created from pre-FMT and post-FMT samples. GF mice were colonized using stools/sterile supernatants. For all mice, frontal cortex, liver, and small/large intestines were collected. Cortical inflammation, synaptic plasticity and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling, and liver inflammation and intestinal 16s ribosomal RNA  sequencing were performed. Conventional cirrhotic mice had higher degrees of neuroinflammation, microglial/glial activation, GABA signaling, and intestinal dysbiosis compared with other groups. Cirr-Hum mice had greater neuroinflammation, microglial/glial activation, and GABA signaling and lower synaptic plasticity compared with Ctrl-Hum mice. This was associated with greater dysbiosis but no change in liver histology. Pre-FMT material colonization was associated with neuroinflammation and microglial activation and dysbiosis, which was reduced significantly with post-FMT samples. Sterile pre-FMT and post-FMT supernatants did not affect brain parameters. Liver inflammation was unaffected. Conclusion:  microbial colonization from patients with cirrhosis results in higher degrees of neuroinflammation and activation of GABAergic and neuronal activation in mice regardless of cirrhosis compared with those from healthy humans. Reduction in neuroinflammation by using samples from post-FMT patients to colonize GF mice shows a direct effect of   independent of active liver inflammation or injury.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231707>  : great potential with many challenges.</a></h2><p>In January of 2019, Samuel P.

Patients were treated with four (4.2 ± 2.1, range 2-9) types of antibiotics before and during the onset of AAD. 38.9% (7/18) of patients had FMT-related AEs during follow-up, including increased diarrhea frequency, abdominal pain, increased serum amylase, and fever. Eight deaths unrelated to FMT occurred during follow-up. One hundred percent (2/2) of abdominal pain, 86.7% (13/15) of diarrhea, 69.2% (9/13) of abdominal distention, and 50% (1/2) of hematochezia were improved after FMT. 44.4% (8/18) of patients recovered from abdominal symptoms without recurrence and survived for a minimum of 12 weeks after being discharged from ICU.In this case series studying the use of FMT in critically ill patients with AAD, good clinical outcomes without infectious complications were observed. These findings could potentially encourage researchers to set up new clinical trials that will provide more insight into the potential benefit and safety of the procedure in the ICU.ClinicalTrials.gov, Number  .

It has been reported that phloretin has anti-inflammatory effects in ulcerative colitis (UC) mice. However, the role of the gut  in the phloretin anti-UC process remains unclear. In this study, we observed that the anti-UC effect of phloretin was affected by co-housing, probably because of the transmissible nature of the gut micobiota. Through  micobiota  (FMT), the effects of the gut  on the anti-UC of phloretin were further confirmed. UC was induced in mice by administrating 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 7 days. Phloretin (60 mg/kg) was administered by gavage every day during the experiment.  microbes (10 CFU/mL) from phloretin-treated UC mice were administered by gavage to non-phloretin-treated UC mice for 7 days. The results showed that FMT, like phloretin, ameliorated UC by improving disease symptoms and colon inflammation, balancing inflammatory cytokines, maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, restoring systemic immune function, inhibiting NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and ameliorating the oxidant stress. Both FMT and phloretin treatment increased the levels of Bacteroidetes, Alistipes and Lactobacillus and decreased those of Firmicutes, Oscillibacter and Ruminiclostridium_6. Correlation analysis between gut microbes and micro-environmental factors revealed that Alistipes abundance was negatively correlated with DAI, pathological score, and TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β levels, and Alistipes was more abundant in phloretin or FMT treated UC mice. Oscillibacter abundance was significantly positively correlated with IL-6 and IL-1β levels and pathological score, and Oscillibacter was increased in UC mice. Furthermore, network analysis of the dominant genera revealed that Alistipes abundance was negatively related to Oscillibacter abundance. In conclusion, this study suggests that the anti-UC effects of phloretin are achieved through regulation of the gut  and phloretin has the potential to be developed as a promising agent for the treatment of UC.Copyright © 2019.

The provision of FMT in routine clinical practice requires an extensive infrastructure that is reliant on voluntary donors. Alongside an increasing demand for FMT, the logistic barriers of a large-scale donor-dependent operation and the difficulties among health authorities to regulate FMT limit the dissemination of sustainable FMT services. Blood centers are large organizations that handle a multitude of donor-dependent operations on a daily basis. Blood and  share many of the same dependencies, and  may present a new opportunity for the blood services to handle. In this paper, we describe how an FMT service may be established and embedded within the blood service infrastructure, and we explain the benefits of using blood donors as  donors. We further explore the current indications of FMT, the challenges related to the lack of legislation, and the future perspectives for blood banks to meet a new and increasing demand.© 2019 The Authors.

Metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, was reported to have ameliorative effects on inflammatory bowel disease. Recently, the mechanism of action of metformin was explained as a modulation of gut . In this study,    (FMT) using  material from metformin-treated mice was found to upregulate the expression of GLP-1 and pattern-recognition receptors TLR1 and TLR4 for the improvement in hyperglycemia caused by a high-fat diet. Further, FMT downregulated the expression of the inflammatory cytokine IL-18. Within the genera , , and , which were promoted by metformin therapy,  was found to be consistently abundant following FMT. Our findings suggest that modulation of gut  is a key factor for the anti-inflammatory effects of metformin which is used for the treatment of hyperglycemia.</p></html>
