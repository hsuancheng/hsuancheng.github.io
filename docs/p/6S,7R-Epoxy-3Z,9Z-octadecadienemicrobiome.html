<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29099689>Identification of novel small RNAs in  KC-01 expressed under iron limitation and oxidative stress conditions.</a></h1><p>Small RNA (sRNA)-mediated regulation of gene expression is a major tool to understand bacterial responses to environmental changes. In particular, pathogenic bacteria employ sRNAs to adapt to the host environment and establish infection. Members of the  complex, normally present in soil microbiota, cause nosocomial lung infection especially in hospitalized cystic fibrosis patients. We sequenced the draft genome of  KC-01, isolated from the coastal saline soil, and identified several potential sRNAs . Expression of seven small RNAs (Bc_KC_sr1-7) was subsequently confirmed. Two sRNAs (Bc_KC_sr1 and Bc_KC_sr2) were upregulated in response to iron depletion by 2,2'-bipyridyl and another two (Bc_KC_sr3 and Bc_KC_sr4) responded to the presence of 60 µM HO in the culture media. Bc_Kc_sr5, 6 and 7 remained unchanged under these conditions. Expression of Bc_KC_sr2, 3 and 4 also altered with a change in temperature and incubation time. A search in the Rfam and BSRD databases identified Bc_Kc_sr4 as candidate738 in  D286 and assigned Bc_Kc_sr5 and 6 as tmRNA and  RNA, respectively. The novel sRNAs were conserved in  but did not have any homologue in other genera. Bc_KC_sr1 and 4 were transcribed independently while the rest were part of the 3' UTR of their upstream genes. TargetRNA2 predicted that these sRNAs could target a host of cellular messages with very high stringency. Intriguingly, regions surrounding the translation initiation site for several enzymes involved in Fe-S cluster and siderophore biosynthesis, ROS homeostasis, porins, transcription and translation regulators, were among the suggested putative binding sites for these sRNAs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31205245>Parasites in Human Stool: To Ignore or Not To Ignore?</a></h1><p>Human stool contains a myriad of microorganisms, of which the vast majority are nonpathogenic and represent an important component of the healthy . The increasing use of molecular techniques has allowed the rapid identification of bacteria, viruses and parasites in human stool. This review focuses on the 3 main classes of parasite responsible for human disease, helminths, protozoa and ectoparasites, and highlights the importance of differentiating between pathogenic and nonpathogenic parasites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208534>Leuconostoc citreum TR116: In-situ production of mannitol in sourdough and its application to reduce sugar in burger buns.</a></h1><p>A marketing study revealed that commercially available burger buns can contain up to 10% (w/w) of added sugar. In order to reduce sugar and maintaining the product quality at the same time, functional ingredients and alternative sweetening agents have to be incorporated. In this study, the sourdough lactic acid bacteria Leuconostoc citreum TR116, selected for its ability to produce high amounts of mannitol, was used to produce wheat sourdough and its biochemical characteristics (cell count, pH, TTA, sugar- and acid profile, as well as mannitol production) were monitored over 48 h. The so produced sourdough was then incorporated, as a functional ingredient, into a sugar reduced burger bun system and the quality characteristics of the dough and the final product were determined. Sourdough incorporation counteract the negative effects of sugar reduction on dough properties and resulted in the same viscoelastic properties (0.423 ± 0.008) and gluten-network-development (PMT: 160 ± 12.6 s; TM: 44.0 ± 2.6 BU) as the full-sugar control dough. Furthermore, the investigation of specific volume, crumb hardness and chewiness revealed no significant differences between sugar reduced sourdough burger buns and its control. It is noteworthy that sourdough contributed to browning reaction resulting in darker crumb and crust colour (-8.2%; -9.6%) and it extended microbial shelf life of the burger buns significantly (+3.5 days). Sensory evaluation showed no significant differences in sweetness and sourness between sugar reduced buns containing sourdough and the full-sugar control. In conclusion, the incorporation of mannitol-rich sourdough fermented by Leuconostoc citreum TR116 represents a novel technological approach in the field of sugar reduction and showed high potential as a functional ingredient to ameliorate the losses of important quality parameters. Especially sourdough containing higher amounts of mannitol and lower amounts of lactate improved significantly the dough and burger bun quality.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The benefits of a dietary protein restriction are once again enlightened, either by reducing the urea found to be hyperglycemic, thus improving the peripheric  sensitivity, or by decreasing phosphorus and FGF23 hormone, whose reductions are respectively associated with nephroprotection and diminution of cardiovascular events. The numerous researches conducted on the gut microbiota also open promising avenues to better understand the role of this ecosystem in CKD. Finally, the interest in incremental haemodialysis is revived, results show it may be associated with less loss of proteins and preservation of residual kidney function. The development of a nutritional score, informative of survival prediction, also offers the possibility to ensure a better follow-up of patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Among all respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the world's leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children. There are known populations at risk for severe disease but the majority of children who require hospitalization for RSV infection are previously healthy. Viral and host factors have been associated with the pathogenesis of RSV disease; however, the mechanisms that explain the wide variability in the clinical presentation are not completely understood. Recent studies suggest that the complex interaction between the respiratory , the host's immune response and the virus may have an impact on the pathogenesis and severity of RSV infection. In this review, we summarize the current evidence regarding the epidemiologic link, the mechanisms of viral-bacterial interactions, and the associations between the upper respiratory tract  and RSV disease severity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29019244>Interindividual Variability in Metabolism of [6]-Shogaol by Gut Microbiota.</a></h1><p>[6]-Shogaol (), one of the major bioactive components in dry ginger, is attracting considerable attention because of its wide spectrum of biological activities, but its metabolic fate is still not fully understood. In the present study, the microbial metabolism of  was examined for the first time in in vitro batch fecal fermentation system and in mice. Two major microbial metabolites were detected and identified as 1-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-ol (M9) and 1-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-one (M11). Our results indicated that reductions of the double bond and the ketone group are the major metabolic pathways of  by the human gut microbiota. We also observed the interindividual variability in the metabolism of M11 to M9 by human gut microbiota. In addition, we demonstrated that the glucuronidated form of  and its metabolites could be rapidly deconjugated by human gut microbiota and in mice, which can be regarded as a reactive process taking place in the intestinal tract. To our knowledge, this is the first report involving the identification of the microbial metabolites of  in an in vitro fermentation system, and the first demonstration of the critical role of gut microbiota in producing the bioactive free form of  and its metabolites in the intestinal tract in mice.</p></html>
