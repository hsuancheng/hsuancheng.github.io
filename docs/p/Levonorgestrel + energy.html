<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26522096>Medical treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding.</a></h2><p>Heavy menstrual bleeding, or menorrhagia, is subjectively defined as a "complaint of a large amount of bleeding during menstrual cycles that occurs over several consecutive cycles" and is objectively defined as menstrual blood loss of more than 80 mL per cycle that is associated with an anemia status (defined as a hemoglobin level of <10 g/dL). During their reproductive age, more than 30% of women will complain of or experience a heavy amount of bleeding, which leads to a debilitating health outcome, including significantly reduced health-related quality of life, and a considerable economic burden on the health care system. Although surgical treatment might be the most important definite treatment, especially hysterectomy for those women who have finished bearing children, the uterus is still regarded as the regulator and controller of important physiological functions, a sexual organ, a source of  and vitality, and a maintainer of youth and attractiveness. This has resulted in a modern trend in which women may reconsider the possibility of organ preservation. For women who wish to retain the uterus, medical treatment may be one of the best alternatives. In this review, recent trends in the management of women with heavy menstrual bleeding are discussed.Copyright © 2015.

Only a few studies explore the effect of progestogen treatment in a mixture as opposed to individual chemicals to shed light on how non-target species respond to these contaminants. In the present study, we used an invertebrate model species, Lymnaea stagnalis, exposed to a mixture of four progestogens (progesterone, , drospirenone, and gestodene) in 10ng/L concentration for 3 weeks. Data at both physiological and cellular/molecular level were analyzed using the ELISA technique, stereomicroscopy combined with time lapse software, and capillary microsampling combined with mass spectrometry. The treatment of adult Lymnaeas caused reduced egg production, and low quality egg mass on the first week, compared to the control. Starting from the second week, the egg production, and the quality of egg mass were similar in both groups. At the end of the third week, the egg production and the vitellogenin-like protein content of the hepatopancreas were significantly elevated in the treated group. At the cellular level, accelerated cell proliferation was observed during early embryogenesis in the treated group. The investigation of metabolomic changes resulted significantly elevated hexose utilization in the single-cell zygote cytoplasm, and elevated adenylate  charge in the egg albumen. These changes suggested that treated snails provided more hexose in the eggs in order to improve offspring viability. Our study contributes to the knowledge of physiological effect of equi-concentration progestogen mixture at environmentally relevant dose on non-target aquatic species.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In a subsample of Depo-Provera users (n = 8), Norplant users (n = 3), and control subjects (n = 4), bone density measurements were repeated after 2 years. Bone density was measured by dual- x-ray absorptiometry.Body mass indexes, level of pubertal development, substance use, and reproductive histories were not significantly different among the groups. More black girls were represented in the initial Depo-Provera group (p < 0.02), girls in the Norplant group exercised more hours per week (p < 0.02), and control subjects were older (p < 0.01) than those in the other groups. These variables did not significantly affect bone density results. After 1 year, bone density decreased 1.5% in Depo-Provera users, compared with increases of 2.5% in Norplant users, 1.5% in oral contraceptive users, and 2.9% control subjects (p < 0.02). After 2 years, bone density increased a total of 9.3% in Norplant users and 9.5% in control subjects but decreased a total of 3.1% in Depo-Provera users (p < 0.0001).These data suggest that Depo-Provera may, at least temporarily, suppress the expected skeletal bone mineralization in adolescents, whereas Norplant and oral contraceptives are associated with the expected increase in bone density in this population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30415281>In silico assessment of new progesterone receptor inhibitors using molecular dynamics: a new insight into breast cancer treatment.</a></h2><p>Nowadays, breast cancer is one of the most widespread malignancies in women, and the second leading cause of cancer death among women. The progesterone receptor (PR) is one of the treatment targets in breast cancer, and can be blocked with selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs). Since administration of chemical drugs can cause serious side effects, and patients, especially those undergoing long-term treatment, can suffer harmful consequences, there is an urgent need to discover novel potent drugs. Large-scale structural diversity is a feature of natural compounds. Accordingly, in the present study, we selected a library of 20,000 natural compounds from the ZINC database, and screened them against the PR for binding affinity and efficacy. In addition, we evaluated the pharmacodynamics and ADMET properties of the compounds and performed molecular docking. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out in order to examine the stability of the protein. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to study the motions of the protein. Finally, the MMPBSA method was applied in order to estimate the binding free . Our docking results reveal that compounds ZINC00936598, ZINC00869973 and ZINC01020370 have the highest binding  into the PR binding site, comparable with that of  (positive control). Moreover, RMSD, RMSF, Rg and H-bond analysis demonstrate that the lead compounds preserve stability in complex with PR during simulation. Our PCA analysis results were in accordance with MD results and the binding free energies support the docking results. This study paves the way for discovery of novel drugs from natural sources and with optimal efficacy, targeting the PR.

The risk-to-benefit ratio must be examined individually by the woman and her health care provider.Implementation of this guideline should optimize the decision-making process of women and their health care providers in proceeding with further investigation or therapy for uterine leiomyomas, having considered the disease process and available treatment options, and reviewed the risks and anticipated benefits.Published literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Systematic Reviews in February 2013, using appropriate controlled vocabulary (uterine fibroids, myoma, leiomyoma, myomectomy, myolysis, heavy menstrual bleeding, and menorrhagia) and key words (myoma, leiomyoma, fibroid, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, hysterectomy, heavy menstrual bleeding, menorrhagia). The reference lists of articles identified were also searched for other relevant publications. Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. There were no date limits but results were limited to English or French language materials. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to January 2014. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, and national and international medical specialty societies.The majority of fibroids are asymptomatic and require no intervention or further investigations. For symptomatic fibroids such as those causing menstrual abnormalities (e.g. heavy, irregular, and prolonged uterine bleeding), iron defficiency anemia, or bulk symptoms (e.g., pelvic pressure/pain, obstructive symptoms), hysterectomy is a definitive solution. However, it is not the preferred solution for women who wish to preserve fertility and/or their uterus. The selected treatment should be directed towards an improvement in symptomatology and quality of life. The cost of the therapy to the health care system and to women with fibroids must be interpreted in the context of the cost of untreated disease conditions and the cost of ongoing or repeat investigative or treatment modalities.The quality of evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Caadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table 1). Summary Statements 1. Uterine fibroids are common, appearing in 70% of women by age 50; the 20% to 50% that are symptomatic have considerable social and economic impact in Canada. (II-3) 2. The presence of uterine fibroids can lead to a variety of clinical challenges. (III) 3. Concern about possible complications related to fibroids in pregnancy is not an indication for myomectomy except in women who have had a previous pregnancy with complications related to these fibroids. (III) 4. Women who have fibroids detected in pregnancy may require additional maternal and fetal surveillance. (II-2) 5. Effective medical treatments for women with abnormal uterine bleeding associated with uterine fibroids include the  intrauterine system, (I) gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, (I) selective progesterone receptor modulators, (I) oral contraceptives, (II-2) progestins, (II-2) and danazol. (II-2) 6. Effective medical treatments for women with bulk symptoms associated with fibroids include selective progesterone receptor modulators and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues. (I) 7. Hysterectomy is the most effective treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids. (III) 8. Myomectomy is an option for women who wish to preserve their uterus or enhance fertility, but carries the potential for further intervention. (II-2) 9. Of the conservative interventional treatments currently available, uterine artery embolization has the longest track record and has been shown to be effective in properly selected patients. (II-3) 10. Newer focused  delivery methods are promising but lack long-term data. (III) Recommendations 1. Women with asymptomatic fibroids should be reassured that there is no evidence to substantiate major concern about malignancy and that hysterectomy is not indicated. (III-D) 2. Treatment of women with uterine leiomyomas must be individualized based on symptomatology, size and location of fibroids, age, need and desire of the patient to preserve fertility or the uterus, the availability of therapy, and the experience of the therapist. (III-B) 3. In women who do not wish to preserve fertility and/or their uterus and who have been counselled regarding the alternatives and risks, hysterectomy by the least invasive approach possible may be offered as the definitive treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids and is associated with a high level of satisfaction. (II-2A) 4. Hysteroscopic myomectomy should be considered first-line conservative surgical therapy for the management of symptomatic intracavitary fibroids. (II-3A) 5. Surgical planning for myomectomy should be based on mapping the location, size, and number of fibroids with the help of appropriate imaging. (III-A) 6. When morcellation is necessary to remove the specimen, the patient should be informed about possible risks and complications, including the fact that in rare cases fibroid(s) may contain unexpected malignancy and that laparoscopic power morcellation may spread the cancer, potentially worsening their prognosis. (III-B) 7. Anemia should be corrected prior to proceeding with elective surgery. (II-2A) Selective progesterone receptor modulators and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues are effective at correcting anemia and should be considered preoperatively in anemic patients. (I-A) 8. Use of vasopressin, bupivacaine and epinephrine, misoprostol, peri-cervical tourniquet, or gelatin-thrombin matrix reduce blood loss at myomectomy and should be considered. (I-A) 9. Uterine artery occlusion by embolization or surgical methods may be offered to selected women with symptomatic uterine fibroids who wish to preserve their uterus. Women choosing uterine artery occlusion for the treatment of fibroids should be counselled regarding possible risks, including the likelihood that fecundity and pregnancy may be impacted. (II-3A) 10. In women who present with acute uterine bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, conservative management with estrogens, selective progesterone receptor modulators, antifibrinolytics, Foley catheter tamponade, and/or operative hysteroscopic intervention may be considered, but hysterectomy may become necessary in some cases. In centres where available, intervention by uterine artery embolization may be considered.

We, therefore, measured the BMR, body build and composition in two groups of young women and also assessed their self-reported level of physical activity. One group had been using oral contraceptive agents for a period of 6 months or more (OCA, n 24), while the other group had never used oral contraceptives (NOCA, n 22). There were no significant differences in age, body build or composition. The absolute BMR in the groups were not significantly different when compared using an unpaired t test (OCA: 5841 (SD 471) v. NOCA: 5633 (SD 615) kJ/d). However, using an analysis of covariance, with either body weight or a combination of fat and fat free mass as covariates, the OCA group had a BMR almost 5% higher than that of the NOCA group (OCA: 5871 v. NOCA: 5601 kJ/d; P = 0.002). When those subjects with high self-reported levels of physical activity were excluded, the difference in BMR between the two groups persisted (P = 0.001). An ANOVA of oral contraceptives use and phase of menstrual cycle showed significant differences in BMR with use of oral contraceptives (P = 0.004) but no difference in BMR between phases of the menstrual cycle. In conclusion, the use of oral contraceptive agents deserves consideration when conducting and analysing data from studies on  metabolism in young women, as it results in a significantly higher BMR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31227390>Impact of Adrenal Hormone Supplementation on Bone Geometry in Growing Teens With Anorexia Nervosa.</a></h2><p>Adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN) have decreased dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and estrogen concentrations that may contribute to skeletal deficits. We sought to determine whether DHEA + estrogen replacement (ERT) prevented bone loss in young adolescents with AN.We recruited females with AN (n = 70, ages 11-18 years) into a 12-month, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomized to oral micronized DHEA 50 mg + 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol/.1 mg  daily (n = 35) or placebo (n = 35). Outcomes included serial measures of bone mineral density (BMD) by dual- X-ray absorptiometry (total body, hip, spine) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT; tibia). Magnetic resonance imaging of T1-weighted images of the left knee determined physeal status (open/closed).Sixty-two subjects completed the trial. Physeal closure status was the strongest predictor of aBMD changes. Among girls with open physes, those who received DHEA + ERT showed a decline in BMD Z-scores compared with those receiving placebo, whereas there was no effect in those with at least one closed physis. Treatment did not affect any pQCT measures, regardless of physeal closure status.Combined DHEA + ERT did not significantly improve dual- X-ray absorptiometry or pQCT BMD measurements in young adolescent girls with AN, in contrast to an earlier trial showing benefit in older adolescents and young women. In girls with open physes, the mean change in the placebo arm was greater than that of the DHEA + ERT group. We conclude that DHEA + ERT is ineffective for preserving bone health in growing young adolescents with AN at the dose and route of administration described in this report.Copyright © 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

At 48 h incubation time, complex 2 is more active than cisplatin (about 8-fold) in T47D (breast cancer) and also shows an improved efficiency when compared to its nonsteroidal analogue [Ru(η(6)-p-cymene)(ppy)Cl] (ppy = phenylpyridine) (3) in the same cell line. The act of conjugating a  group to a ruthenium(II) complex resulted in synergistic effects between the metallic center and the steroidal ligand, creating highly potent ruthenium(II) complexes from the inactive components. The interaction of 2 with DNA was followed by electrophoretic mobility. Theoretical density functional theory calculations on complex 2 show the metal center far away from the lipophilic steroidal moiety and a labile Ru-Cl bond that allows easy replacement of Cl by N-nucleophiles such as 9-EtG, thus forming a stronger Ru-N bond. We also found a minimum  location for the chloride counteranion (4(+)·Cl(-)) inside the pseudocavity formed by the α side of the steroid moiety, the phenylpyridine chelating subsystem, and the guanine ligand, i.e., a host-guest species with a rich variety of nonbonding interactions that include nonclassical C-H···anion bonds, as supported by electrospray ionization mass spectra.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1381897>Concentration of fat, protein, lactose and  in milk of mothers using hormonal contraceptives.</a></h2><p>, protein, lactose and fat were studied in the milk of mothers who were using different types of contraceptives.

The mean stages of lactation were, respectively, 15, 17, 5, 9, 5 and 9 weeks. The mean duration of observation for the study groups ranged from 2 to 4 weeks. Milk samples were collected before and after initiation of treatment (mean = 20 days; range = 14-103 days). The stage of lactation and the interval of nursing before sampling were recorded so that statistical account could be taken of these uncontrollable sources of variability. When incorporated as covariates, they showed that no significant differences existed between the groups tested, either before or after treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12058900>Prediction of internal standards in reversed-phase liquid chromatography. II. Selectivity optimization and internal standard prediction for the quantitation of estradiol and  in a transdermal drug delivery formulation based on the linear solvation  relationships.</a></h2><p>This paper describes the results of selectivity optimization and internal standard prediction for the quantitation of estradiol and  in transdermal patches by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) based on the linear solvation  relationships (LSERs). The patch samples are prepared by swelling with acetonitrile (ACN) and the separation is performed by Zorbax Eclipse XDB ODS columns. A proper retention range is first determined with a binary mobile phase of ACN and water based on the general resolution equation. The interference to estradiol from a  impurity is then eliminated by a ternary mobile phase of acetonitrile-methanol-water with a composition predicted by LSERs. When the resolution is optimized and the "open window" in the chromatogram for an internal standard is selected, LSERs are used to predict the candidate compounds to be evaluated as the internal standard. The approach described in this study can be used, in general, to considerably improve the efficiency of RPLC method development, particularly for neutral samples. Finally, the LSER approach for the selectivity optimization is compared with a statistical response surface methodology (RSM) based on a central composite design (CCD) in terms of the effectiveness and number of experiments. It is concluded that, although the predicted mobile phase composition to achieve the desired selectivity is about the same, the LSER approach is more efficient and fewer experiments are required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9347205>Bone mineral density during long-term treatment with Norplant implants and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate. A cross-sectional study of Thai women.</a></h2><p>This cross-sectional study compares bone mineral density (BMD) in long-term Norplant implants and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) users. The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the bone mineral density between women using these contraceptives. Forty-one current users of Norplant implants and 50 DMPA users participated in the study. The BMD was measured by dual  x-ray absorptiometry in the nondominant distal and ultradistal forearm. Serum estradiol was measured by microparticle enzyme immunoassay technique. The demographic characteristics were similar in both groups. The mean durations +/- SD of DMPA and Norplant implants were 59.14 +/- 30.73 and 31.1 +/- 11.2 months, respectively. The BMD of long-term Norplant implant and DMPA users was similar. The serum estradiol in the Norplant implant group was significantly higher than in DMPA users. However, the serum estradiol level in DMPA users ranged into normal for the follicular phase, which is higher than for postmenopausal women. This study suggests that two long-acting progestogen contraceptives do not differ with respect to their impact on BMD in long-term users.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21138370>Women's views and experiences of their vaginal bleeding patterns: an international perspective from Norplant users.</a></h2><p>Contraceptive-induced vaginal bleeding changes may be an undesired side effect, or a welcome opportunity to alter menstrual patterns. In Europe and the US, such changes are increasingly accepted; this study explores the perceptions of women around the globe.Norplant users from five countries (Chile, China, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia and Tunisia; N = 486) were surveyed at entry into a contraceptive clinical trial regarding preferred frequency of menstruation, menses-associated symptoms, and activities during menses.Most women preferred once-monthly menstruation (81%); women in Chile, younger women, women neither married nor cohabitating, Christian women, and women experienced with hormonal contraception were more likely to accept alternative bleeding patterns. Women in Tunisia and Chile reported more symptoms associated with menses, while women in Beijing reported very few; decreased  (32%), headaches (26%), abdominal pain (23%) and depression (22%) were most common. Avoidance of activities during menses such as physical work, sports, praying and entering religious sites, was closely tied to study centre. Across all sites, women (90%) avoided sexual intercourse during menses.Despite growing acceptance of altering bleeding patterns, women in this study preferred monthly vaginal bleeding.

During the 2 years of the study, bone mineral content of the distal and ultradistal regions of the forearm (measured by single-photon absorptiometry) remained unchanged in the hormone groups, whereas bone mineral content at these sites decreased by 5 and 6%, respectively, in the placebo group. Bone mineral density in the spine (measured by dual-photon absorptiometry and dual- x-ray absorptiometry) increased by 3-4% in the hormone groups and decreased by 2% in the placebo group. Biochemical estimates of bone turnover (serum alkaline phosphatase and fasting urinary calcium/creatinine) decreased significantly to premenopausal levels in the hormone groups, but remained unchanged in the placebo group. Serum concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly reduced by 5-10% (P less than .05-.01) in the estradiol + cyproterone acetate group and by 10-15% (P less than .001) in the estradiol valerate +  group.

In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we investigated the effects of oral DHEA + combined oral contraceptive (COC) versus placebo on changes in bone geometry in young women with AN. Eighty women with AN, aged 13 to 27 years, received a random, double-blinded assignment to micronized DHEA (50 mg/day) + COC (20 µg ethinyl estradiol/0.1 mg ) or placebo for 18 months. Measurements of areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the total hip were obtained by dual- X-ray absorptiometry at 0, 6, 12, and 18 months. We used the Hip Structural Analysis (HSA) program to determine BMD, cross-sectional area (CSA), and section modulus at the femoral neck and shaft. Each measurement was expressed as a percentage of the age-, height-, and lean mass-specific mean from an independent sample of healthy adolescent females. Over the 18 months, DHEA + COC led to stabilization in femoral shaft BMD (0.0 ± 0.5% of normal mean for age, height, and lean mass/year) compared with decreases in the placebo group (-1.1 ± 0.5% per year, p = 0.03). Similarly, CSA, section modulus, and cortical thickness improved with treatment. In young women with AN, adrenal and gonadal hormone replacement improved bone health and increased cross-sectional geometry.

The acetylated medroxyprogesterone (MPA), megestrol (MGA) and chlormadinone (CLA) are related to progesterone (P). Other SPs are 19-nortestosterone derivatives such as: norethisterone (NET), norethynodrel (NED) or the 13-ethyl gonane,  (LNG). We studied MPA, NET, NED and LNG in a dose-response manner to induce sexual receptivity in rats. Results showed that MPA, NET and NED act as partial agonists, with similar or lower potency than P. However, LNG is a full agonist. Additionally, the molecules of MPA, MGA, CLA, NET, NED, LNG, and P, were submitted to computer calculations at ab initio quantum mechanics theory, to obtain their electronic structure and molecular properties. The aim was to correlate their behavioral effect with their physicochemical properties. In addition, the crystals of P, NET and LNG bound to the progesterone receptor (PR) were studied. The PR crystallizes as a dimer forming two monomers (mA and mB), in which Gln725 interacts in either of two possible ways with the C3-carbonyl pharmacophore of progestins. P binds differentially to both PR monomers, while NET binds exclusively as mA and LNG binds only as mB in both monomers with no difference. Energetically, binding of LNG and P to mB, is more favorable than that of NET and P to mA. Consequently, this bimodal mechanism increases the action possibilities of SPs on biological systems. Interestingly, progestin potency depends mostly on local molecular structure and electronic features, prevailing over total molecular properties.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We defined groups based on women's pretreatment hemoglobin [hemoglobin <120 g/L (anemic) vs. hemoglobin ≥120 g/L (nonanemic)] and serum ferritin (ferritin <15 μg/L vs. ≥15 μg/L) concentrations. HRQoL was compared between groups at baseline, 6 and 12 months after treatment. Hemoglobin and ferritin were followed for 5 years.HRQoL was measured by the RAND 36-item health survey (RAND-36), 5-Dimensional EuroQol and two questionnaires of mental wellbeing.At baseline, 63 women (27%) were anemic and 140 (60%) were severely iron deficient (ferritin <15 μg/L). Only 8% of the anemic women had taken iron supplementation. Twelve months after treatment hemoglobin had increased in both hemoglobin groups, but was still significantly lower (p < 0.001) in initially anemic women (128 g/L) compared with nonanemic women (136 g/L). Twelve months after treatment three domain scores of RAND-36 increased more (, p = 0.002; physical functioning, p = 0.04; social functioning, p = 0.05), and anxiety (p = 0.02) and depression scores (p = 0.002) decreased more in anemic compared with nonanemic women. Serum ferritin took 5 years to reach normal levels.Improved HRQoL after treatment of HMB is associated with correction of anemia.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of the -releasing intrauterine system on the quality of life and sexual functioning of women. The research encompassed 200 women aged between 30 and 45. 52 women using the -releasing intrauterine system were qualified to the study as the research group (Mirena Group). The control groups consisted of 48 women using a different type of intrauterine device (Control Group I--Other IUD) and 50 women using no contraception (Control Group II). A specific questionnaire with a general part concerning socio-demographic conditions, a part dealing with contraception and Polish version of self-evaluation inventories: Short Form-36 Health Survey, Female Sexual Function Index and Mell-Krat Scale was used as a research tool. Quality of life parameters for women using the Mirena system were higher than for the control groups, especially in the aspect of general health, /fatigue and emotional well-being. A significant beneficial effect of the -releasing intrauterine system on sexual functioning (sexual desire and arousal) was also revealed in the study. Sexual dysfunctions were diagnosed in 20.8% of Other IUD, 34.7% of Control Group II and 9.6% of Mirena Group. -releasing intrauterine system increases female quality of life and sexual functioning parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9373569>Oral contraceptive treatment inhibits the normal acquisition of bone mineral in skeletally immature young adult female monkeys.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of oral contraceptive therapy on bone density and serum markers of bone metabolism in a prospective, longitudinal study of young adult female cynomolgus monkeys. Two hundred and seven intact cynomolgus monkeys were randomized to two groups, and fed an atherogenic diet containing either no drug (Control) or a triphasic oral contraceptive regimen (Contraceptive). Measurements of bone density were carried out by dual- X-ray absorptiometry at 10-month intervals (0, 10, and 20 months) and serum bone biomarkers were determined at 5-month intervals over the 20-month time course. No significant differences in these variables were observed prior to treatment. Both groups of animals gained bone mineral during the study, indicating that peak bone mass had not been reached at baseline. Contraceptive-treated animals gained less spinal (lumbar vertebrae 2-4) bone mineral content and density and less whole-body bone mineral content than Controls over the course of the study. Significant depressive effects of contraceptive treatment on gains in BMC and BMD were observed during each 10-month interval of the study. Bone metabolism was inhibited in the Contraceptive group, as reflected by marked reductions (approximately 40%) in serum osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase levels along with moderate reductions in serum acid phosphatase and calcium. The results suggest that triphasic oral contraceptive treatment of young adult female monkeys that have not reached peak bone mass inhibits net bone accretion and/or growth by reducing bone metabolism. Thus, prolonged continuous oral contraceptive use in skeletally immature females may lead to a lower peak bone mass--an effect which could increase the risk of fractures in later life.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1901319>Estrogen monotherapy and combined estrogen-progestogen replacement therapy attenuate aortic accumulation of cholesterol in ovariectomized cholesterol-fed rabbits.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular disease is currently the leading cause of death among women in the United States. To investigate the effect of postmenopausal hormone therapy on atherogenesis, we studied 75 cholesterol-fed female rabbits for 19 wk. The rabbits were randomly assigned to five groups. Four groups underwent bilateral ovariectomy followed by treatment with either 17 beta-estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol plus norethisterone acetate, 17 beta-estradiol plus , or placebo. The fifth group had a sham operation and received placebo. The hormone groups had only one-third of the aortic accumulation of cholesterol found in the placebo groups, a difference that was highly statistically significant (P less than 0.0001). No significant differences in aortic accumulation of cholesterol were found in the hormone groups. This indicates that estrogen attenuates atherogenesis in cholesterol-fed ovariectomized rabbits and that two commonly prescribed progestogens do not counteract the effect. The beneficial effect of estradiol could only partly be explained by its lowering effects on serum total cholesterol or VLDL cholesterol, which implies that estradiol possesses additional beneficial effects, possibly a direct action on the arterial wall.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9385772>Bone density in women receiving Norplant implants for contraception.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine whether long-term Norplant uses is associated with changes in bone density. The study group consisted of forty one healthy women aged 19-42 years who had used Norplant for 31.1 +/- 11.2 months with a minimum period of 12 months. Fifty current IUD users constituted the control group. The bone density was measured by dual  X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at the non dominant distal and ultradistal forearm. Serum estradiol was measured by microparticle enzyme immunoassay technique. Age, parity, income, weight, height and body mass index (BMI) of both groups were no differences. Our analysis did not find any differences in bone mineral density of distal forearm and ultradistal forearm between Norplant and IUD users (95% CI -0.01, -0.03 and -0.02, 0.02 respectively). Serum estradiol was not different in the two groups (95% CI -24.9, 110).

A primate model.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine if oral contraceptive (OC) use affects body weight, body composition and metabolism in primates.Reproductive-age female rhesus monkeys of normal and obese BMI were studied to document baseline weight stability, then treated continuously with an OC (dosed to achieve equivalent human serum levels for a 30 µg ethinyl estradiol/150 µg  preparation) for 237 days. Monkeys were monitored for changes in body weight, levels of physical activity (measured by a triaxial Actical accelerometer), food/caloric intake, percent body fat (dual  X-ray absorptiometry, DEXA) and metabolism (24 h metabolic rate and serum metabolic substrate and hormone concentrations).All 10 monkeys completed the study protocol with no adverse events. While body weight (-0.73% change) and percent body fat (-1.78% change) of the normal BMI group did not significantly decrease from baseline, obese monkeys showed a significant decrease in body weight (-8.58% change, P < 0.01) and percent body fat (-12.13% change P = 0.02) with OC treatment. In both the obese (P = 0.03) and the normal BMI (P = 0.01) groups, there was a significant increase in basal metabolic rate with OC use. No changes were seen in food intake, activity level or % lean muscle mass with OC use for either BMI-based group.Overall, OC use appears to cause a slight increase in basal metabolic rate in female monkeys, leading to a decrease in body weight and percent body fat in obese individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20185512>Prospective study of the forearm bone mineral density of long-term users of the -releasing intrauterine system.</a></h2><p>The -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) induces amenorrhoea, and its effect on bone mineral density (BMD) may constitute a concern. This study evaluated BMD in long-term users of the LNG-IUS or intrauterine device (IUD).BMD was evaluated at the midshaft of the ulna and ultra-distal radius using dual- X-ray absorptiometry in 37 women at 7 or 10 years of use following placement of a second LNG-IUS. The groups were paired for duration of use, age, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity and number of pregnancies.The mean age of both LNG-IUS and IUD users at the 7th and 10th year was approximately 34 and 38 years, respectively. Mean BMI was approximately 25 in both groups, increasing to approximately 26 at the 10th year. Amenorrhoea occurred in 51.4 and 91.9% of LNG-IUS users at the 7th and 10th year, respectively. Estradiol levels in LNG-IUS users were normal at both evaluations. There were no differences in BMD (g/cm(2)) at the midshaft of the ulna nor ultra-distal radius between LNG-IUS and IUD users or between the 7th and 10th years of use in LNG-IUS users. A Z-score below -2SD at the ultra-distal radius was observed in only one LNG-IUS user and in none of the IUD users at the 10th year. Higher BMI and BMD at the seventh year and amenorrhoea were predictors of higher BMD at the 10th year.BMD at the midshaft of the ulna and ultra-distal radius in LNG-IUS users were similar to that of IUD users and remained unchanged between the 7th and the 10th years of use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12414853>Effects of oral dehydroepiandrosterone on bone density in young women with anorexia nervosa: a randomized trial.</a></h2><p>Young women with anorexia nervosa (AN) have subnormal levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and estrogen that may be mechanistically linked to the bone loss seen in this disease. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a 1-yr course of oral DHEA treatment vs. conventional hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) in young women with AN. Sixty-one young women were randomly assigned to receive oral DHEA (50 mg/d) or HRT (20 micro g ethinyl estradiol/0.1 mg ). Anthropometric, nutrition, and exercise data were acquired every 3 months, and bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition were measured by dual  x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) every 6 months over 1 yr. Serum samples were obtained for measurements of hormones, proresorptive cytokines, and bone formation markers, and urine was collected for determinations of bone resorption markers at each visit. In initial analyses, total hip BMD increased significantly and similarly (+1.7%) in both groups. Hip BMD increases were positively correlated with increases in IGF-I (r = 0.44; P = 0.030) and the bone formation marker, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase increased significantly only in the DHEA treatment group (P = 0.003). However, both groups gained significant amounts of weight over the year of therapy, and after controlling for weight gain, no treatment effect was detectable. There was no significant change in lumbar BMD in either group. Both bone formation markers, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, increased transiently at 6-9 months in those subjects receiving DHEA compared with the estrogen-treated group (P < 0.05). Both DHEA and HRT significantly reduced levels of the bone resorption markers, urinary N-telopeptides (P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between changes in IGF-I and changes in weight, body fat determined by DXA, and estradiol for both groups. In addition, patients receiving DHEA exhibited improvement on three validated psychological instruments (Eating Attitudes Test, Anorexia Nervosa Subtest, and Spielberger Anxiety Inventory). Both DHEA and HRT had similar effects on hip and spinal BMD. Over the year of treatment, maintenance of both hip and spinal BMD was seen, but there was no significant increase after accounting for weight gain. Compared with HRT, DHEA appeared to have anabolic effects, evidenced by the positive correlation between increases in hip DXA measurements and IGF-I and significant increases in bone formation markers. Both therapies significantly decreased bone resorption. Replicating results from studies of the elderly, DHEA resulted in improvements in specific psychological parameters in these young women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22762147>Effects on bone mineral density of a monophasic combined oral contraceptive containing nomegestrol acetate/17β-estradiol in comparison to /ethinylestradiol.</a></h2><p>To compare the effects of a monophasic combined oral contraceptive containing nomegestrol acetate/17β-estradiol (NOMAC/E2) on bone mineral density with a combined oral contraceptive containing /ethinylestradiol (LNG/EE).Prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative clinical study.Gynecology center in Norway.One hundred and ten women (20-35 years old) actively seeking contraception.

Compound LNG gelatin-microspheres were prepared by phase-separation method, natural biodegradable gelatin being used as the core material. The experimental conditions were optimized, the mean diameter of the microspheres obtained being 10-40 microns, and the rate of encapsulation 65-75%. Storage observations and acceleration tests of the compound LNG gelatin-microsphere injection prepared showed that the microspheres have good stability. The thermal degradation activation  of the injection was determined to be 134.4 kJ/mol, based on differential scanning colorimetry (DSC). T1/2 values for dissolution in vitro of LNG and E2 from the compound LNG gelatin-microsphere injection and from the unencapsulated injection showed significant difference (P < 0.01), indicating that the microspheres have good sustained release action. Effects of the pure LNG microsphere injection and compound LNG microsphere injection on the mouse ovary were compared histologically. The results showed that the compound LNG microsphere injection reduced some of the side effects such as ovary congestion.

To assess the environmental risk of , batch experiments and laboratory microcosm studies were conducted to investigate the adsorption and degradation of  in five contrasting soils of China. Freundlich and Langmuir models were applied to sorption data to examine the affinity of  for soils with varying physical and chemical properties. The K(f) of  in the tested soils ranged from 10.79 to 60.92 mg(1-n) L(n) kg(-1) with N between 0.69 and 1.23, and the Q(m) ranged from 18.18 to 196.08 mg/kg. The multiple regression analysis was conducted between K(f) and soil properties. Results indicate that total organic carbon plays a dominant role in the adsorption process. Gibbs free  values less than 40 kJ/mol demonstrate that  sorption on soils could be considered as a physical adsorption. The degradation of  in five soils was fitted by the first-order reaction kinetics model. The half-lives of  were between 4.32 and 11.55 days.

The frequent detection of these compounds in water samples requires alternative technologies for the removal of both compounds. After electrochemical degradation of PRZ and LNG, the parent compounds could be completely removed after treatment, but the identification and characterization of by-products are necessary as well. In this study, the effects of NaCl concentration and applied voltage were investigated during the electrochemical degradation process. The results revealed that the increase of NaCl concentration and applied voltage could promote the generation of hypochlorite OCl and then enhance the degradation of PRZ and LNG.

The increase in mean percent change at the femoral neck in the OC group, 0.3% (95% CI -0.87, 1.41), was significantly lower than in the control group (p = .03).Our study contributes to an increasing body of knowledge indicating a negative impact of DMPA on bone health in young women. Additional findings suggest a potential adverse effect of an OC containing 20 microg ethinyl estradiol/100 microg  on bone health in adolescents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11875330>The effect of hormone replacement therapy on appendicular lean tissue mass in early postmenopausal women.</a></h2><p>The impact of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on skeletal muscle mass is still a controversial issue in women's health. Some authors hypothesize anabolic effects, others catabolic. These hypotheses, however, await confirmation by longitudinal observations based on more direct measurements of muscle mass. The aim of the present preliminary study was to evaluate the effect of a 3-year HRT program on appendicular lean tissue mass (LTM(A)) in early postmenopausal women aged 45-54 years.This was a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial. Women received HRT with 2 mg estradiol valerate combined either continuously with 1 mg cyproterone acetate (days 1-28; n = 15) or sequentially with 75 mug  (days 17-28; n = 15), or placebo (n = 18). Serum estradiol was measured by radioimmunoassay. LTM(A) was measured by dual photon absorptiometry (baseline) and dual  X-ray absorptiometry (years 2 and 3).Baseline serum estradiol did not show significant correlation with the respective LTM(A) (r = 0.018, p = 0.88, n = 75). Cross-sectional analysis found no significant differences between the intervention groups at any time points. The longitudinal changes between years 2 and 3 showed a trend toward decreasing LTM(A) in those receiving HRT (-0.08 +/- 0.12 kg, n = 30) compared to those receiving placebo (0.12 +/- 0.25 kg, n = 18, p = 0.44).The present preliminary study did not find significant effects on LTM(A) caused by HRT. The trends toward decreasing LTM(A) in the HRT groups might suggest catabolic rather than anabolic effects. These trends, however, await confirmation by larger clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12629101>The male contraceptive regimen of testosterone and  significantly increases lean mass in healthy young men in 4 weeks, but attenuates a decrease in fat mass induced by testosterone alone.</a></h2><p>In hypogonadal men, testosterone (T) in replacement dosages is known to increase fat-free mass (lean mass) and decrease fat mass. In young eugonadal men, similar dosages of T increase lean mass, but much higher dosages of T are required to decrease total body fat mass. Current T-based male hormonal contraceptive regimens include a second agent, such as a progestin, to maximize inhibition of pituitary gonadotropins and improve efficacy. To study the effect of such combinations on body composition, we randomized healthy, young, eugonadal men into four combinations of exogenous T and the progestin,  (LNG): 1) 100 mg T enanthate, im, weekly plus 125 micro g LNG, orally, daily (T+LNG); 2) T plus placebo LNG (T alone); 3) placebo T plus LNG (LNG alone); and 4) placebo T plus placebo LNG (placebo). We then analyzed body composition by dual  x-ray absorptiometry after 4 and 8 wk of treatment. T+LNG significantly increased total lean mass after 4 and 8 wk of treatment (3.5 +/- 0.9% and 4.2 +/- 1.2%, respectively; P < 0.05) and truncal lean mass after 4 and 8 wk of treatment (4.7 +/- 0.9% and 5.0 +/- 0.9%, respectively; P < 0.05) compared with baseline and placebo. T alone also increased total and truncal lean mass significantly compared with placebo after 4 wk of treatment, but not compared with baseline (3.3 +/- 1.4% and 3.2 +/- 2.3%, respectively; P < 0.05 vs. placebo), suggesting an additive effect of T and LNG to increase lean mass. Fat mass significantly decreased in the abdomen in men administered T alone compared with LNG alone (-4.9 +/- 2.8%; P < 0.05). Fat mass significantly increased in the abdomen with LNG alone (4.1 +/- 1.0%; P < 0.05) compared with baseline and was unchanged with the combination of T+LNG, suggesting that LNG attenuates the decrease in fat mass seen with T alone. There was no change in weight or body mass index in any group during the study. This study shows that in young eugonadal men 1) T alone rapidly increases lean mass and decreases fat mass in 4-8 wk; 2) T+LNG rapidly increases lean mass, but has no effect on fat mass; and 3) LNG alone increases fat mass. The favorable profile on body composition by T is, therefore, partially attenuated by the progestin, LNG. These findings suggest that androgen-based male hormonal contraceptives might have favorable effects on body composition. The impact of these changes on cardiovascular risk in normal men needs further study.</p></html>
