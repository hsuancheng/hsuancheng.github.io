In this work, eight peptides were isolated from F7 and identified as Gly-Pro- (GPY, 335.31 Da), Gly-Pro--Gly-Glu (GPTGE, 459.47 Da), Pro-Phe-Gly-Pro-Asp (PFGPD, 531.52 Da), Gly-Pro--Gly-Ala- (GPTGAKG, 586.65 Da), Pro--Gly-Ala--Gly (PYGAKG, 591.69 Da), Gly-Ala--Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly (GATGPQG, 586.61 Da), Gly-Pro-Phe-Gly-Pro-Met (GPFGPM, 604.73 Da), and -Gly-Pro-Met (YGPM, 466.50 Da), respectively. Among them, PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM exhibited strong radical scavenging activities on DPPH (EC values of 0.80, 3.02, and 0.72 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively), hydroxyl (EC values of 0.81, 0.66, and 0.88 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively), superoxide anion (EC values of 0.91, 0.80, and 0.73 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively), and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) cation (EC values of 0.86, 1.07, and 0.82 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively) in a positive concentration-activity relationship. Furthermore, PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM could effectively reduce Fe to Fe and inhibit lipid peroxidation. Hence, eight collagen peptides from hydrolysate of Spanish mackerel skins might be served as antioxidant candidates for various industrial applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005070>Fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs exhibit differences in nutrient composition according to body weight and gestational period.</a></h1><p>Low birth weight may negatively affect  storage and nutrient metabolism, and impair fetal growth and development. We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude fat, amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight, fat percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, Arg, crude fat, Gly, Pro, , C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the liver, lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, , Phe, Ser, , essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude fat, C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower  concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude fat and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27012465>Ubiquitin modifications.</a></h1><p>Protein ubiquitination is a dynamic multifaceted post-translational modification involved in nearly all aspects of eukaryotic biology. Once attached to a substrate, the 76-amino acid protein ubiquitin is subjected to further modifications, creating a multitude of distinct signals with distinct cellular outcomes, referred to as the 'ubiquitin code'. Ubiquitin can be ubiquitinated on seven lysine () residues or on the N-terminus, leading to polyubiquitin chains that can encompass complex topologies. Alternatively or in addition, ubiquitin  residues can be modified by ubiquitin-like molecules (such as SUMO or NEDD8). Finally, ubiquitin can also be acetylated on , or phosphorylated on Ser,  or  residues, and each modification has the potential to dramatically alter the signaling outcome. While the number of distinctly modified ubiquitin species in cells is mind-boggling, much progress has been made to characterize the roles of distinct ubiquitin modifications, and many enzymes and receptors have been identified that create, recognize or remove these ubiquitin modifications. We here provide an overview of the various ubiquitin modifications present in cells, and highlight recent progress on ubiquitin chain biology. We then discuss the recent findings in the field of ubiquitin acetylation and phosphorylation, with a focus on Ser65-phosphorylation and its role in mitophagy and Parkin activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27315826>Effect of extrusion processing of soybean meal on ileal amino acid digestibility and growth performance of broiler chicks.</a></h1><p>The present experiments were conducted to investigate the efficacy of extrusion of inadequately processed soybean meal (SBM) on amino acid (AA) digestibility and performance of broiler chicks. In Exp. 1, 180 day-old Ross broiler chicks were randomly distributed between 6 pen replicates (15 chicks each) of 2 dietary treatments; diets based on SBM or extruded SBM (ESBM) as the main protein sources. Based on the results of Exp. 1 and AA digestibility assay, Exp. 2 was designed using 216 day-old Ross broiler chicks (6 replicates of 18 chicks each), in which dietary SBM content was replaced by 86% using ESBM. This replacement caused about a 9% decrease in dietary crude protein (CP) level. Results showed that coefficients of CP and AA digestibility were greater (P < 0.05) for ESBM than those of SBM. Extrusion processing of SBM increased digestibility coefficients of , , Cys, Leu, Phe, , Pro, Ser, and Gly. Except during the starter period, dietary inclusion of ESBM increased (P < 0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI) in Exp. 1 and caused increases (P < 0.01) in average daily weight gains (ADWG) throughout the trial period. Also, using ESBM improved the (P < 0.01) feed conversion ratio (FCR) during starter and finisher periods. In Exp. 2, reducing dietary CP level using ESBM decreased both ADFI (P < 0.05) and ADWG (P < 0.01) in the starter period. During grower, finisher, and entire trial periods, however, ADFI and ADWG were not influenced by dietary treatments. Dietary inclusion of ESBM improved (P < 0.05) FCR value in the finisher period. Although carcass yield was not affected by dietary treatments, reducing dietary CP level resulted in an increase (P < 0.05) in abdominal fat percentage. Moreover, a decrease in dietary CP level reduced (P = 0.08) breast yield. The present findings indicate that extrusion of SBM could improve its nutritive value for broiler chicks. Using ESBM, one can reduce dietary CP level by about 9% without any detrimental effect on performance parameters of broiler chicks.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25161153>Emerging roles of post-translational modifications in signal transduction and angiogenesis.</a></h1><p>The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) belongs to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases and is a key player in vasculogenesis and pathological angiogenesis. An emerging picture of PTMs of VEGFR-2 suggests that they play central roles in generating a highly dynamic and complex signaling system that regulates key angiogenic responses ranging from endothelial cell differentiation, proliferation, migration to permeability. Recent MS analysis of VEGFR-2 uncovered previously unrecognized PTMs on VEGFR-2 with a distinct function. The ligand binding extracellular domain of VEGFR-2 is composed of seven immunoglobulin-like domains highly decorated with N-glycosylation, while its cytoplasmic domain is subject to multiple PTMs including , Ser/ phosphorylation, Arg and  methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination. Here we review the PTMs on VEGFR-2, their importance in angiogenic signaling relays and possible novel therapeutic potentials.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

After 6, 12, 24, 48 and 120 hr aspartate (Asp), glutamate (Glu), asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser), glutamine (Gln), histidine (His), glycine (Gly), threonine (), citrulline (Cit), arginine (Arg), alanine (Ala), taurine (Tau), γ-aminobutyrate (GABA), tyrosine (), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), l-cystathionine (l-Cystat), valine (Val), methionine (Met), tryptophane (Trp), phenylalanine (Phe), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), ornithine (Orn), lysine (), plus N-acetylaspartate (NAA) were determined in whole brain extracts (n = 6 rats at each time for both TBI levels). Sham-operated animals (n = 6) were used as controls. Results demonstrated that mTBI caused modest, transient changes in NAA, Asp, GABA, Gly, Arg. Following sTBI, animals showed profound, long-lasting modifications of Glu, Gln, NAA, Asp, GABA, Ser, Gly, Ala, Arg, Citr, Tau, Met, SAH, l-Cystat,  and Phe. Increase in Glu and Gln, depletion of NAA and Asp increase, suggested a link between NAA hydrolysis and excitotoxicity after sTBI. Additionally, sTBI rats showed net imbalances of the Glu-Gln/GABA cycle between neurons and astrocytes, and of the methyl-cycle (demonstrated by decrease in Met, and increase in SAH and l-Cystat), throughout the post-injury period. Besides evidencing new potential targets for novel pharmacological treatments, these results suggest that the force acting on the brain tissue at the time of the impact is the main determinant of the reactions ignited and involving amino acid .© 2016 The Authors.

The protein degradation characteristics of BSD1 was studied with rice protein as the sole nitrogen source. Maximum protein degradation activity was obtained when BSD1 was inoculated with an inoculum of 5% into a medium with glucose as carbon source and initial pH value of 7.0 and incubated at 30°C for 48 h. In this optimal condition, protein concentration decreased from 156.8 mg/L to 19.2 mg/L, and protein degradation efficiency of BSD1 reached 88%. Free amino acid analysis showed that the content of Phe, , Pro, Ala, ,  and His increased in protein degradation process. After degradation, NHN concentration producing in medium supernatant reached 232.2 mg/L. These results indicated the strain BSD1 could transform proteins into free amino acids and eventually convert them to ammonium or ammonia. Furthermore, strain BSD1 could also be used for deproteinization of brewery spent diatomite and 51% of proteins in spent diatomite were degraded. After biological deproteinization the specific surface area and total pore volume of diatomite improved obviously. These results illustrated that the application of strain BSD1 for bio-regeneration of high-protein brewery spent diatomite was efficient and feasible.Copyright © 2018 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

Free amino acid pools increased; bound amino acid pools reduced. In vegetative tissues, amino acid biosyntheses linked to osmo-compatibility (Pro, Leu, Val and GABA); N (Arg, Asn, Asp, Gln, and Glu); C (Pro, Ser, and ); S (Cys) assimilation; stress tolerance (Ala, Gly, Hyp, His, , Met, and ); and central metabolism (Phe, Trp, and ) enhanced for 60-120 days. Concentrations of Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, Leu, and Ser in leaf and of Asp, Cys, Glu, His, Hyp, , Met, Pro, and Val in root predominated. In planta SA and GABA biosynthesis increased concurrently. SA affected GABA biosynthesis via Glu, Pro, and Arg metabolism. SA, GABA, Glu, and Pro were key canonical variables.

Moreover, these antibiotics even restricted for patient suffering from severe dehydration. Hence, there is a call to find an alternative therapeutics against V. cholerae. The natures serve different herbs in its lap which might contain several natural therapeutic compounds almost all diseases. Computer-aided designing is the initial steps for screening the novel inhibitors.To identify and evaluate natural compounds with low side effects with high efficacy against V. cholerae has been done.In silico screening, absorption, digestion, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), and docking of herbal compounds have been performed on to the target ToxT (transcriptional activator of V. cholerae). The compound with good ADME properties and drug-likeness property were subjected to docking.From 70 herbal compounds, some compounds such as aloin, campesterol, lupeol, and ursolic acid showed a violation of the rule of five and compounds such as lupeol and beta carotene showed negative binding . Luteolin, catechin, brevifolin, etc., compounds were selected based on ADME, drug-likeness property, and docking studies.Two compounds named catechin and luteolin showed better inhibition properties against ToxT and good ADME and drug-likeness property were selected as a better lead molecule for drug development in future. The Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking fitness score for catechin is 48.74 kcal/mol and luteolin 38.12 kcal/mol.Vibrio cholerae became antibiotic resistance and associated with several cholera epidemic and pandemic.

Here, we have used the apical muscle of the starfish Patiria pectinifera to assay for myorelaxants in extracts of this species. A hexadecapeptide with the amino acid sequence Phe-Gly--Gly-Gly-Ala--Asp-Pro-Leu-Ser-Ala-Gly-Phe--Asp was identified and designated starfish myorelaxant peptide (SMP). Cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding the SMP precursor protein revealed that it comprises 12 copies of SMP as well as 3 peptides (7 copies in total) that are structurally related to SMP. Analysis of the expression of SMP precursor transcripts in P. pectinifera using qPCR revealed the highest expression in the radial nerve cords and lower expression levels in a range of neuromuscular tissues, including the apical muscle, tube feet and cardiac stomach. Consistent with these findings, SMP also caused relaxation of tube foot and cardiac stomach preparations. Furthermore, SMP caused relaxation of apical muscle preparations from another starfish species - Asterias amurensis. Collectively, these data indicate that SMP has a general physiological role as a muscle relaxant in starfish. Interestingly, comparison of the sequence of the SMP precursor with known neuropeptide precursors revealed that SMP belongs to a bilaterian family of neuropeptides that include molluscan pedal peptides (PP) and arthropodan orcokinins (OK). This is the first study to determine the function of a PP/OK-type peptide in a deuterostome. Pedal peptide/orcokinin (PP/OK)-type peptides are a family of structurally related neuropeptides that were first identified and functionally characterised in protostomian invertebrates. Here, we report the discovery of starfish myorelaxant peptide (SMP), a novel member of the PP/OK-type neuropeptide identified in the starfish Patiria pectinifera (phylum Echinodermata). SMP is the first PP/OK-type neuropeptide to be functionally characterised in a deuterostome.© 2016 The Authors.

Data on somatostatin receptor expression in follicular thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer has been limited and conflicting. This study seeks to characterize somatostatin receptor expression in follicular thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer and to assess the effects of somatostatin analogues.Anaplastic thyroid cancer (Hth7 and 8505C) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC-236) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) cells were cultured. Capillary immunoblotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to determine the basal expression of protein and mRNA of SSTR1-SSTR5. Cells were treated with the somatostatin analogues octreotide, pasireotride (SOM230), and KE-108 for 48h. IC was determined via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and cell proliferation was measured by viable cell count. Presence of SSTR2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry.Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that most cell lines expressed SSTR1-SSTR3 and SSTR5 in varying degrees. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that mRNA expression for SSTR2 and SSTR3 correlated with protein expression. MTT assays showed that KE-108 and SOM230 were able to inhibit cell proliferation. Tissue microarray (TMA) showed that SSTR2 was highly expressed in human tissues of aggressive thyroid carcinomas.Follicular thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer express SSTR1-3 and SSTR5 in distinct fashions both at a message and protein level. Our results suggest that somatostatin receptors are still a relevant and promising drug target against non-medullary thyroid cancers.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30322930>Proximity-enhanced SuFEx chemical cross-linker for specific and multitargeting cross-linking mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry (CXMS) is being increasingly used to study protein assemblies and complex protein interaction . Existing CXMS chemical cross-linkers target only , Cys, Glu, and Asp residues, limiting the information measurable. Here we report a "plant-and-cast" cross-linking strategy that employs a heterobifunctional cross-linker that contains a highly reactive succinimide ester as well as a less reactive sulfonyl fluoride. The succinimide ester reacts rapidly with surface  residues "planting" the reagent at fixed locations on protein. The pendant aryl sulfonyl fluoride is then "cast" across a limited range of the protein surface, where it can react with multiple weakly nucleophilic amino acid sidechains in a proximity-enhanced sulfur-fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction. Using proteins of known structures, we demonstrated that the heterobifunctional agent formed cross-links between  residues and His, Ser, , , and  sidechains. This geometric specificity contrasts with current bis-succinimide esters, which often generate nonspecific cross-links between lysines brought into proximity by rare thermal fluctuations. Thus, the current method can provide diverse and robust distance restraints to guide integrative modeling. This work provides a chemical cross-linker targeting unactivated Ser, , His, and  residues using sulfonyl fluorides. In addition, this methodology yielded a variety of cross-links when applied to the complex  cell lysate. Finally, in combination with genetically encoded chemical cross-linking, cross-linking using this reagent markedly increased the identification of weak and transient enzyme-substrate interactions in live cells. Proximity-dependent cross-linking will dramatically expand the scope and power of CXMS for defining the identities and structures of protein complexes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155583>Abnormal Amino Acid Profiles of Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid from Cystathionine β-Synthase-Deficient Mice, an Animal Model of Homocystinuria.</a></h1><p>Mental retardation is the most common feature among inborn errors of amino acid . Patients with homocystinuria/homocysteinemia caused by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) deficiency suffer from thromboembolism and mental retardation from early ages; therefore, detection by newborn screening is performed. Furthermore, elevated levels of serum homocysteine during pregnancy are associated with the occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs) in newborns. However, the causes of such central nervous system (CNS) defects are unknown. We found previously impaired learning abilities in Cbs-deficient (Cbs) mice (but not NTD births). Here, we investigated the amino acid profiles of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from Cbs mice. Mice deficient in cystathionine γ-lyase (Cth), a downstream enzyme of CBS in transsulfuration, as well as wild-type mice, were analyzed as controls. Cbs and Cth mice were smaller than wild-type mice, and CSF yields in Cbs mice were lower than the others. CSF amino acid levels were generally lower than those in serum, and compared with the dramatic amino acid level alterations in Cbs mouse serum, alterations in CSF were less apparent. However, marked upregulation (versus wild-type) of aspartic acid/asparagine (Asp/Asn), glutamine (Gln), serine (Ser), threonine (), phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (), methionine (Met), total homocysteine, and citrulline, and downregulation of lysine () were found in Cbs mouse CSF. Because similar regulation of total homocysteine/citrulline/ was observed in the CSF of Cth mice, which are free of CNS dysfunction, the reduced CSF volumes and the level changes of other amino acids could be relevant to Cbs-specific CNS defects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27271343>AGIA Tag System Based on a High Affinity Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody against Human Dopamine Receptor D1 for Protein Analysis.</a></h1><p>Polypeptide tag technology is widely used for protein detection and affinity purification. It consists of two fundamental elements: a peptide sequence and a binder which specifically binds to the peptide tag. In many tag systems, antibodies have been used as binder due to their high affinity and specificity. Recently, we obtained clone Ra48, a high-affinity rabbit monoclonal antibody (mAb) against dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1). Here, we report a novel tag system composed of Ra48 antibody and its epitope sequence. Using a deletion assay, we identified EEAAGIARP in the C-terminal region of DRD1 as the minimal epitope of Ra48 mAb, and we named this sequence the "AGIA" tag, based on its central sequence. The tag sequence does not include the four amino acids, Ser, , , or , which are susceptible to post-translational modification. We demonstrated performance of this new tag system in biochemical and cell biology applications. SPR analysis demonstrated that the affinity of the Ra48 mAb to the AGIA tag was 4.90 × 10-9 M. AGIA tag showed remarkably high sensitivity and specificity in immunoblotting. A number of AGIA-fused proteins overexpressed in animal and plant cells were detected by anti-AGIA antibody in immunoblotting and immunostaining with low background, and were immunoprecipitated efficiently. Furthermore, a single amino acid substitution of the second Glu to Asp (AGIA/E2D) enabled competitive dissociation of AGIA/E2D-tagged protein by adding wild-type AGIA peptide. It enabled one-step purification of AGIA/E2D-tagged recombinant proteins by peptide competition under physiological conditions. The sensitivity and specificity of the AGIA system makes it suitable for use in multiple methods for protein analysis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29230895>Dissecting and analyzing key residues in protein-DNA complexes.</a></h1><p>Protein-DNA interactions are involved in various fundamental biological processes such as replication, transcription, DNA repair, and gene regulation. To understand the interaction in protein-DNA complexes, the integrative study of binding and stabilizing residues is important. In the present study, we have identified key residues that play a dual role in both binding and stability from a nonredundant dataset of 319 protein-DNA complexes. We observed that key residues are identified in very less number of complexes (29%) and only about 4% of stabilizing/binding residues are identified as key residues. Specifically, stabilizing residues have higher preference to be key residues than binding residues. These key residues include polar, nonpolar, aliphatic, aromatic, and charged amino acids. Moreover, we have analyzed and discussed the key residues in different protein-DNA complexes, which are classified based on protein structural class, function, DNA strand, and their conformations. Especially, Ser, , , Arg, and  residues are commonly found in most of the subclasses of protein-DNA complexes. Further, we analyzed atomic contacts, which show that polar-nonpolar is more enriched than other types of contacts. In addition, the charged contacts are highly preferred in protein-DNA complexes compared with protein-protein and protein-RNA complexes. Finally, we have discussed the sequence and structural features of key residues such as conservation score, surrounding hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility, secondary structure, and long-range order. This study will be helpful to understand the recognition mechanism and structural and functional aspects of protein-DNA complexes.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26885710>Manganism and Parkinson's disease: Mn(II) and Zn(II) interaction with a 30-amino acid fragment.</a></h1><p>A protected 30-amino acid fragment, Acetyl-SPDEKHELMIQLQKLDYTVGFCGDGANDCG-Amide, Acetyl-Ser-Pro-Asp-Glu--His-Glu-Leu-Met-Ile-Gln-Leu-Gln--Leu-Asp---Val-Gly-Phe-Cys-Gly-Asp-Gly-Ala-Asn-Asp-Cys-Gly-Amide, encompassing the sequence from residues 1164 to 1193 in the encoded protein from Parkinson's disease gene Park9 (YPk9), was studied for manganese and zinc binding. Manganese exposure is considered to be an environmental risk factor connected to PD and PD-like syndrome. Research into the genetic and environmental risk factors involved in disease susceptibility has recently uncovered a link existing between Park9 and manganese. It seems that manganese binding to Park9 (YPk9) protein is involved in the detoxification mechanism exerted by this protein against manganese toxicity. In this study, we used potentiometric, mono- and bi-dimensional (TOCSY, HSQC) NMR, EPR and ESI-MS measurements to analyze complex formation and metal binding sites in the peptide fragment. Presumably octahedral species, in which the Mn(II) ion was bound to oxygens of the carboxyl groups of Glu and Asp, and species where the involvement of sulfur from Cys and nitrogen from His residues, depending on the metal to ligand molar ratio, were detected for manganese coordination. Structural changes in the 30-amino acid fragment were triggered by Zn(II) interaction. A general decrease in the intensity of NMR signals was detected, suggesting the occurrence of chemical exchange among some coordinated species in an intermediate NMR timescale. The coordination may involve both S and N donor atoms from cysteine as well as histidine residues, together with O donor atoms from glutamic and aspartic residues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27398680>Probing the binding of Cu(2+) ions to a fragment of the Aβ(1-42) polypeptide using fluorescence spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular dynamics simulations.</a></h1><p>Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence quenching measurements supported by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and molecular dynamics simulations (MD), with the NMR-derived restraints, were used to investigate the interactions of Cu(2+) ions with a fragment of the Aβ(1-42) polypeptide, Aβ(5-16) with the following sequence: Ac-Arg-His-Asp-Ser-Gly--Glu-Val-His-His-Gln--NH2, denoted as HZ1. The studies presented in this paper, when compared with our previous results (Makowska et al., Spectrochim. Acta A 153: 451-456), show that the affinity of the peptide to metal ions is conformation-dependent. All the measurements were carried out in 20mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer solution, pH6.0. The Stern-Volmer equations, along with spectroscopic observations, were used to determine the quenching and binding parameters. The obtained results unequivocally suggest that Cu(2+) ions quench the fluorescence of HZ1 only through a static quenching mechanism, in contrast to the fragment from the N-terminal part of the FPB28 protein, with sequence Ac----Ala-Asp-Gly---- NH2 (D9) and its derivative with a single point mutation: Ac----Ala-Asn-Gly---- NH2 (D9_M), where dynamic quenching occurred. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔITCH, ΔITCS) for the interactions between Cu(2+) ions and the HZ1 peptide were determined from the calorimetric data. The conditional thermodynamic parameters suggest that, under the experimental conditions, the formation of the Cu(2+)-HZ1 complex is both an enthalpy and entropy driven process.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study , in silico binding affinities and interactions were determined between the N-terminal domain of NPC1L1 and 14 pulse peptides (5≥ amino acids) derived through pepsin-pancreatin digestion. Peptides were docked in triplicate to the N-terminal domain using docking program AutoDock Vina, and results were compared to those of ezetimibe, a prescribed NPC1L1 inhibitor. Three black bean peptides (-7.2 to -7.0kcal/mol) and the cowpea bean dipeptide -Asp (-7.0kcal/mol) had higher binding affinities than ezetimibe (-6.6kcal/mol) for the N-terminal domain of NPC1L1. Lentil and pea peptides studied did not have high binding affinities. The common bean peptide -Ala-Ala-Ala- (-7.2kcal/mol), which can be produced from black or navy bean proteins, had the highest binding affinity. Ezetimibe and peptides with high binding affinities for the N-terminal domain are expected to interact at different locations of the N-terminal domain. All high affinity black bean peptides are expected to have van der Waals interactions with SER130, PHE136, and LEU236 and a conventional hydrogen bond with GLU238 of NPC1L1. Due to their high affinity for the N-terminal domain of NPC1L1, black and cowpea bean peptides produced in the digestive track have the potential to disrupt interactions between NPC1L1 and membrane proteins that lead to cholesterol absorption.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Experiment 1 was conducted to validate a dietary formulation approach in which broilers were fed 1 of 5 diets including a 19.0% CP corn-soybean meal based (CSBM) diet, a LCP control diet (16.7% CP) that matched the AA profile of the CSBM diet, and 3 LCP diets with 30% reductions in standardized ileal digestible concentrations of TSAA, , or  from 14 to 23 d post-hatch. Body weight gain and G:F were greatest (P < 0.05) and similar for broilers fed the CSBM and LCP control diets, whereas reductions in , TSAA, and  each decreased (P < 0.05) G:F of broilers. In Experiment 2, birds were allotted to 18 treatment groups in a factorial arrangement of 9 dietary treatments × 2 infection states. Dietary treatments included a LCP control diet similar to that fed in Experiment 1 and 8 LCP diets with 40% individual reductions in TSAA, , , Val, Ile, Arg, Phe + , or Gly + Ser. Broilers received experimental diets from 10 d to 28 d post-hatch and were inoculated with 0 or 4.0 × 10 sporulated E. acervulina oocysts at 15 d. Decreased (P < 0.05) growth performance (10 to 28 d) of broilers was observed with each AA reduction, except Phe + , compared with birds fed the LCP control diet. Body weight gain and G:F were lowest (P < 0.05) for birds fed diets reduced in  or Val. Eimeria acervulina decreased growth performance and plasma carotenoids of broilers, but effects varied among dietary treatment groups as indicated by diet × infection interactions (P < 0.05). Dietary AA reductions did not alter (P > 0.05) the increase in intestinal gene expression of interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, or interleukin-10 observed in E. acervulina-infected birds.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27140209>Urotensin II((4-11)) Azasulfuryl Peptides: Synthesis and Biological Activity.</a></h1><p>Cyclic azasulfuryl (As) peptide analogs of the urotensin II (UII, 1, H-Glu--Pro-Asp-c[Cys-Phe-Trp---Cys]-Val-OH) fragment 4-11 were synthesized to explore the influences of backbone structure on biological activity. N-Aminosulfamides were inserted as surrogates of the Trp(7) and (8) residues in the biologically relevant Trp-- triad. A combination of solution- and solid-phase methods were used to prepare novel UII((4-11)) analogs 6-11 by routes featuring alkylation of azasulfuryl-glycine tripeptide precursors to install various side chains. The pharmacological profiles of derivatives 6-11 were tested in vitro using a competitive binding assay and ex vivo using a rat aortic ring bioassay. Although the analogs exhibited weak affinity for the urotensin II receptor (UT) without agonistic activity, azasulfuryl-UII((4-11)) derivatives 7-9 reduced up to 50% of the effects of UII and urotensin II-related peptide (URP) without affecting their potency.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29682906>Profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus MN-ZLW-002 nutrient requirements in controlled pH batch fermentations.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to evaluate the profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus nutrient requirements to guide the design of media for high cell density culturing. The growth kinetics, physiological state, and nutrient requirement profiles of S. thermophilus were analyzed in chemically defined media. The results showed that the intracellular ATP concentration, H -ATPase activity, NADH/NAD , and NH concentrations varied with intracellular pH. The nutrient components with the highest amounts required were Leu and Asp; ascorbic acid and p-amino benzoic acid; K and PO  ; and guanine and uracil. The nutrient components with the largest required ratios were Arg, His, and Met; folic acid, cyanocobalamine, biotin, and nicotinic acid; Ca and Mg ; and guanine and uracil. In this study, different nutrient components were primarily used at different phase. Trp, , calcium pantothenate, thiamine, guanine, and Mg were mainly used from late-lag to midexponential phase. Met, Pro, Phe, Ala, Gly, nicotinic acid, and riboflavin were mainly used from midexponential to late-exponential phase. The highest bioavailabilities of nutrient components were also found at diverse phase. Met, Leu, Ile, Asn, Glu, , Pro, Gly, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, adenine, uracil, inosine, and Ca had the highest bioavailability from late-lag to midexponential phase. Lactose, Glu, Asp, His, Trp, Cys, Val, Arg, Phe, Ala, Ser, , , folate and cobalamin, calcium pantothenate, ascorbic acid, thiamine, biotin, p-amino benzoic acid, vitamin B , K , Mg , guanine, xanthine, and PO  had the highest bioavailability from midexponential to late-exponential phase. This study elucidated the nutrient requirement profiles with culture time and biomass at various average growth rates during the growth of S. thermophilus.

Its β subunit shares with Ib counterparts the requirements for manganese(II) and superoxide (O) for activation, but it does not require the O-supplying flavoprotein (NrdI) needed in Ib systems, instead scavenging the oxidant from solution. Although Fj β has tyrosine at the appropriate sequence position ( 104), this residue is not oxidized to a radical upon activation, as occurs in the Ia/b proteins. Rather, Fj β directly deploys an oxidized dimanganese cofactor for radical initiation. In treatment with one-electron reductants, the cofactor can undergo cooperative three-electron reduction to the II/II state, in contrast to the quantitative univalent reduction to inactive "met" (III/III) forms seen with I(a-c) βs. This tendency makes Fj β unusually robust, as the II/II form can readily be reactivated. The structure of the protein rationalizes its distinctive traits. A distortion in a core helix of the ferritin-like architecture renders the active site unusually open, introduces a cavity near the cofactor, and positions a subclass-d-specific  residue to shepherd O to the Mn cluster. Relative to the positions of the radical tyrosines in the Ia/b proteins, the unreactive  104 of Fj β is held away from the cofactor by a hydrogen bond with a subclass-d-specific  residue. Structural comparisons, considered with its uniquely simple mode of activation, suggest that the Id protein might most closely resemble the primordial RNR-β.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566595>Effect of inclusion level of corn germ meal on the digestible and metabolizable  and evaluation of ileal AA digestibility of corn germ meal fed to growing pigs.</a></h1><p>Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of inclusion level of corn germ meal (CGM) on the DE and ME values of CGM and to evaluate the ileal AA digestibility of CGM fed to growing pigs. In Exp. 1, 42 barrows (63.8 ± 2.1 kg BW) were allotted to seven diets in a completely randomized design with six replicates per diet. Diets included a corn-soybean meal (SBM) diet and six additional diets containing 4.85%, 9.70%, 19.40%, 29.10%, 38.80%, or 48.50% CGM. Pigs were fed twice daily, at 0730 and 1630 hours, at a level of 4% of BW, and feces and urine were collected for 5 d. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, OM, CP, acid-hydrolyzed ether extract, and the DE and ME in diets linearly decreased (P < 0.01) as dietary CGM increased. Inclusion level of CGM had no effect on the DE and ME values of CGM. On a DM basis, the concentration of DE and ME varied from 3,396 to 3,747 kcal/kg and 3,107 to 3,502 kcal/kg, respectively. In Exp. 2, 11 crossbred barrows (30.4 ± 2.9 kg BW) with a T-cannula in the distal ileum were allotted to an 11 × 6 Youden square design with 11 diets and 6 period, which included an N-free diet and 10 CGM test diets. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was included in all diets as an indigestible marker. Pigs were fed daily at 4% of BW during each period, which consisted of 5 d of diet adaptation followed by 2 d of digesta collection. The apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of Ile, , and Ala and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and Ile varied (P < 0.01) among the 10 CGM. The AID of CP and all AA except Pro and , and the SID of all AA except Pro were the greatest (P < 0.05) in sample 7. The AID and SID of CP averaged 40.47% and 64.75%, respectively, and varied from 32.30% to 54.87% and from 57.48% to 72.15%, respectively. The average SID of , Met, , and Trp was 65.61%, 76.15%, 65.29%, and 60.17%, respectively, with a SEM of 4.49, 2.40, 5.95, and 6.82, respectively. The average SID of Pro was 101.76%, with an SEM of 17.26. Increasing dietary CGM decreased the ATTD of nutrients, the DE and ME values of diets but CGM. The AID and SID of AA in CGM are low but source dependent, and CGM may be fed to pigs as an protein-rich feedstuff.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26877091>Critical POU domain residues confer Oct4 uniqueness in somatic cell reprogramming.</a></h1><p>The POU domain transcription factor Oct4 plays critical roles in self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Together with Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, Oct4 can reprogram any other cell types to pluripotency, in which Oct4 is the only factor that cannot be functionally replaced by other POU family members. To investigate the determinant elements of Oct4 uniqueness, we performed Ala scan on all Ser, , ,  and Arg of murine Oct4 by testing their capability in somatic cell reprogramming. We uncovered a series of residues that are important for Oct4 functionality, in which almost all of these key residues are within the POU domains making direct interaction with DNA. The Oct4 N- and C-terminal transactivation domains (TADs) are not unique and could be replaced by the Yes-associated protein (YAP) TAD domain to support reprogramming. More importantly, we uncovered two important residues that confer Oct4 uniqueness in somatic cell reprogramming. Our systematic structure-function analyses bring novel mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of how critical residues function together to confer Oct4 uniqueness among POU family for somatic cell reprogramming.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26170631>Adaptive evolution and elucidating the potential inhibitor against schizophrenia to target DAOA (G72) isoforms.</a></h1><p>Schizophrenia (SZ), a chronic mental and heritable disorder characterized by neurophysiological impairment and neuropsychological abnormalities, is strongly associated with D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA, G72). Research studies emphasized that overexpression of DAOA may be responsible for improper functioning of neurotransmitters, resulting in neurological disorders like SZ. In the present study, a hybrid approach of comparative modeling and molecular docking followed by inhibitor identification and structure modeling was employed. Screening was performed by two-dimensional similarity search against selected inhibitor, keeping in view the physiochemical properties of the inhibitor. Here, we report an inhibitor compound which showed maximum binding affinity against four selected isoforms of DAOA. Docking studies revealed that Glu-53, -54, -58, Val-85, Ser-86, -87, Leu-88, Glu-90, Leu-95, Val-98, Ser-100, Glu-112, -116, -120, Asp-121, and Arg-122 are critical residues for receptor-ligand interaction. The C-terminal of selected isoforms is conserved, and binding was observed on the conserved region of isoforms. We propose that selected inhibitor might be more potent on the basis of binding energy values. Further analysis of this inhibitor through site-directed mutagenesis could be helpful for exploring the details of ligand-binding pockets. Overall, the findings of this study may be helpful in designing novel therapeutic targets to cure SZ.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28380606>Amino acid digestibility in soybean meal sourced from different regions of the United States and fed to pigs.</a></h1><p>An experiment was conducted to determine the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) by growing pigs of AA in soybean meal (SBM) produced in different regions of the United States. Twenty-two growing barrows (25.5 ± 1.73 kg) were fitted with a T-cannula near the distal ileum and allotted to a 22 × 8 Youden square design. Twenty-two sources of SBM were procured from soybean crushing plants located throughout the United States. For analysis, the crushing plant locations were separated into the following 3 zones: 1) Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota ( = 4); 2) Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio ( = 11); and 3) Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska ( = 7). Dietary treatments included 22 diets based on a mixture of cornstarch, sucrose, and each source of SBM as the sole source of CP. Results indicated that the concentration of most indispensable and dispensable AA in SBM were not different among zones. However, SBM from zone 2 had a greater ( < 0.05) concentration of  than SBM from zone 3 and a greater ( < 0.05) concentration of Gly than SBM from zone 1. The concentration of  in SBM from zone 2 was also greater ( < 0.05) than in SBM from zones 1 and 3. However, if concentrations of AA were calculated as a percent of CP, there were no differences in the concentrations of indispensable and dispensable AA among SBM from the 3 zones. Likewise, the AID of CP and the AID of indispensable and dispensable AA were not different among SBM from the 3 zones. The SID of CP and most AA was also not different among SBM from the 3 zones. However, SBM from zone 3 had a greater ( < 0.05) SID of His, Asp, and Cys than SBM from zone 2, and SBM from zone 1 had a greater ( < 0.05) SID of  than SBM from zone 2. There was also a tendency ( < 0.10) for SBM from zone 3 to have a greater SID of Ile, Leu, Phe, Val, Ala, and  than SBM from zone 2. If the concentrations of SID CP and AA were calculated as grams per kilogram, SBM among the 3 zones were not different with the exception that there was a tendency ( = 0.07) for SBM from zone 2 to contain more SID  and SID  than SBM from zone 3. In conclusion, only a few differences in concentrations and digestibility of CP and AA exist among sources of SBM from different zones in the United States. These observations indicate that the protein value is not different among SBM produced in the United States regardless of the location of the crushing plants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29993582>Identification and Analysis of Key Residues in Protein-RNA Complexes.</a></h1><p>Protein-RNA complexes play important roles in various biological processes. The functions of protein-RNA complexes are dictated by their interactions, binding, stability, and affinity. In this work, we have identified the key residues (KRs), which are involved in both stability and binding. We found that 42 percent of considered proteins share common binding and stabilizing residues, whereas these residues are distinct in 58 percent of the proteins. Overall, 5 percent of stabilizing and 3 percent of binding residues serve as key residues. These residues are enriched with the combination of polar, charged, aliphatic, and aromatic residues. Analysis on subclasses of protein-RNA complexes based on protein structural class, function and RNA type showed that regulatory proteins, and complexes with single stranded RNA and rRNA have appreciable number of key residues. Specifically, Arg, , and  are preferred in most of the subclasses of protein-RNA complexes. In addition, residues with similar chemical behavior have different preferences to be KRs, such that Arg, , Val, and  are preferred over , Trp, Ile, and Ser, respectively. Atomic level contacts revealed that charged and polar-nonpolar contacts are dominant in enzymes, polar in structural, and nonpolar in regulatory proteins. On the other hand, polar-nonpolar contacts are enriched in all these classes of protein-RNA complexes. Further, the influence of sequence and structural features such as conservation score, surrounding hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility, secondary structure, and long-range order in key residues are also discussed. We envisage that the present study provides insights to understand the structural and functional aspects of protein-RNA complexes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28844736>Structure and binding studies of proliferating cell nuclear antigen from Leishmania donovani.</a></h1><p>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) acts as a sliding clamp to support DNA replication and repair. The structure of PCNA from Leishmania donovani (LdPCNA) has been determined at 2.73Å resolution. Structure consists of six crystallographically independent molecules which form two trimeric rings. The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37Å. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces. In order to gain a stable packing, the rings are rotated by 42° about the pore axis and shifted by 7Å and tilted by 16° along the perpendicular direction to pore axis. This form of stacking reduced the effective diameter of the pore to 32Å. The sequence of LdPCNA consists of a long segment of 41 amino acid residues (186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg-Ser---Ser-Glu-Val--Ala-Glu-Val--Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg-Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg---Gly--Ala-Asp-Ser-Ser-Ala-Asn-Ala-Ile-226) whereas the corresponding segments in other PCNAs contain only eight residues corresponding to 186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg------224-Asn-Ala-Ile-226. The enhanced length of this segment in LdPCNA may influence its mode of interaction with DNA and other proteins. The dissociation constants obtained using real time binding studies with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for two peptides, -Arg-Arg-Gln--Ser-Met--Asp-Phe--His (P1) from human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1(CKI-1) and --Gln-Gly-Arg-Leu-Asp-Ser-Phe-Phe--Val (P2) from flap endonuclease 1 (Fen-1) as well as with two small molecule inhibitors, (S)-4-(4-(2-amino-3-hydroxypropyl)-2, 6-diiodophenoxy) phenol hydrochloride (ADPH) and N-(3-methylthiophene-2-carboxylicacid)-N'-((3-hydroxy-2-naphthalenyl) methylene) hydrazide (MCMH) are 0.29±0.09μM, 0.37±0.08μM, 0.35±0.09μM and 1.20±0.08μM respectively. The corresponding values obtained using fluorescence spectroscopic methods were 0.22±0.06μM, 0.68±0.07μM, 0.44±0.07μM and 0.75±0.05μM respectively.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Structures of AAA were determined in its native form and in complex with the analgesic acetanilide, p-acetaminophenol, at 1.70 Å and 1.73 Å resolutions, respectively. The overall structural fold of AAA was identified as an α/β fold class, exhibiting an open twisted β-sheet core surrounded by α-helices. The asymmetric unit contains one AAA molecule and the monomeric form is functionally active. The core structure enclosing the signature sequence region, including the canonical Ser-cisSer- catalytic triad, is conserved in all members of the Amidase Signature enzyme family. The structure of AAA in a complex with its ligand reveals a unique organization in the substrate-binding pocket. The binding pocket consists of two loops (loop1 and loop2) in the amidase signature sequence and one helix (α10) in the non-amidase signature sequence. We identified two residues ((136) and (330)) that interact with the ligand via water molecules, and a hydrogen-bonding network that explains the catalytic affinity over various aryl acyl compounds. The optimum activity of AAA at pH > 10 suggests that the reaction mechanism employs (84) as the catalytic base to polarize the Ser(187) nucleophile in the catalytic triad.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Adding extra protein-bound or free AA to the diet may correct the reduced AA intake of HS pigs. However, extra protein-bound AA may further increase the body heat load, whereas extra free AA does not affect the heat load of HS pigs. Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, the performance depression because of HS, compared with thermal neutrality, was determined with 30 pigs (31.1 ± 1.2 kg BW) fed diets with AA only as protein or as a mix of protein and free AA. Heat stress pigs consumed 18 to 25% less  and  than thermal neutral. In Exp. 2, the effect of extra dietary protein-bound or free AA on performance and serum concentration of AA in 25 HS pigs (33.6 ± 0.65 kg BW) was evaluated. Treatments were as follows: CON, wheat-soybean meal-free --Met diet; xP diet, 26% more protein than the CON diet; xAA diet, 24% or more of each AA than the recommended level. Pigs were fed ad libitum. Blood samples were collected between 1600 and 1700 h, when pigs were exposed to the highest ambient temperature (around 41.3 °C). Body temperature ranged daily from 39.9 to 41.1 °C. The performance data were reported already. Pigs fed the xP diet consumed more of all indispensable AA and dispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05), and more Arg, Ile, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Ser (P < 0.05) than the xAA pigs. Except for Arg, xAA pigs consumed more indispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Arg, His, , Phe, , Trp, and Val, was higher (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Except for Ile serum, indispensable AA were higher in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Ile, Leu, , and Val were higher (P < 0.05), and Met tended to be higher (P < 0.10) in xAA than in xP pigs. The difference of Ile, Leu, Met, , and Val between the CON and the xAA pigs was larger than that between the CON and the xP pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Asn and  were higher, and Cys and Glu were lower (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Serum Cys tended to be lower in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.10). Asp and Glu were higher (P < 0.05) in xAA pigs than in xP pigs. In conclusion, these serum AA results combined with the reported performance data indicate that extra free AA in diets for HS pigs may help to correct the reduced AA availability and performance of HS pigs, although higher levels of specific AA such as Ile and Met might be needed.© The Author(s) 2019.

It is affecting approximately up to 14% of all pregnancies with an increasing tendency. GDM has been related to relevant short-term and long-term health complications for both mother and offspring. Recent studies strongly emphasized the role of several essential amino acids in the pathogenesis of obesity and highlighted their strong correlation with insulin resistance, but there are no references related to modifications in D-AAs in biological fluids. As D-AA elimination proceeds mainly by renal excretion, urine was the selected sample to evaluate the alterations in free D-AAs ratio in a GDM study. Only 1 mL of first void urine or standard solution was required for purification, by using a Discovery DSC-SCX SPE cartridge (500 mg/3 mL) and derivatization into their N(O)-pentafluoropropionyl amino acid 2-propyl esters. Enantiomeric separation was carried out by GC-MS on a Chirasil-L-Val N-propionyl-L-valine-tert-butylamide polysiloxane fused-silica capillary column (25 m×0.25 mm I.D., 0.12 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), under programmed temperature elution. Detection was performed with an ion trap mass analyzer, operating in the full scan mode in the m/z 50-350 range. 14 pairs of derivatives of D-and L-AAs were separated. The steps of sample preparation, derivatization and GC-MS conditions were optimized for both urine and standards. Several conditions affecting the SPE procedure, such as sorbent mass/volume ratio of the cartridge, sample dilution and pH, were optimized. Volume of reagents and solvents and reaction temperature and time were also tested for the derivatization. Regarding the GC-MS parameters, split ratio, temperature program and mass range were optimized. The final method was validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, accuracy and precision for D-Ala, D-Pro, D-Ser, D-Met, D-Phe, D-Glu, D-Orn and D-. Identification of AAs in urine samples was based on retention time and mass spectra. Urine from 20 women with GDM and 20 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (after 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test), matched according to the week of gestation and age (22-28 week of gestation and age 24-37 years), were enrolled into the study. %D-Relative amounts were determined for Ala, Val, , Ser, Leu, Asx (Asp+Asn), Glx (Glu+Gln), Met, Phe, , Orn and . Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed only for D-Phe and higher values were found in the GDM group. It is possible that D-Phe could be involved in /signaling  to compensate early stages of insulin resistance, although further work is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Eight barrows with an initial BW of 34.6 kg (SD 2.1) were individually fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and randomly allotted to a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 4 diets and 4 periods per square. Three diets contained corn, soybean meal (SBM), or distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS) as the sole source of CP. An N-free diet was also prepared. All diets contained 0.5% chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. Equal meals were provided at 0800 and 2000 h. Ileal digesta samples were collected in 2-h intervals from 0800 to 2000 h during the last 3 d of each 7-d period. When pigs were fed the corn diet, the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of most indispensable AA and dispensable AA increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) during each of the six 2-h periods.

When pigs were fed the SBM diet, the SID of Ile, Leu, , Trp, Val, Ala, and Cys increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) but the SID of all other AA linearly decreased ( < 0.05) during the six 2-h periods. The SID of almost all AA were greater ( < 0.05) if the ileal samples were collected from 0800 to 1000 h, from 0800 to 1200 h, from 1000 to 1400 h, or from 0800 to 1400 h but less ( < 0.05) if collected from 1600 to 1800 h, from 1800 to 2000 h, from 1600 to 2000 h, or from 1400 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. When pigs were fed the DDGS-based diet, the SID of Ile, Leu, , Phe, Trp, Val, and  increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) during the six 2-h periods. The SID of most AA were less ( < 0.05) if the ileal samples were collected from 1800 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. In conclusion, diurnal variations in SID of AA in pigs indicate that 6 h of ileal sample collection starting 4 or 6 h after feeding may provide representative samples of ileal digesta from pigs fed different types of diets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26789775>Synthesis, Characterization, and In Vitro Evaluation of New (99m)Tc/Re(V)-Cyclized Octreotide Analogues: An Experimental and Computational Approach.</a></h1><p>Radiolabeled proteolytic degradation-resistant somatostatin analogues have been of long-standing interest as cancer imaging and radiotherapy agents for targeting somatostatin receptor-positive tumors. Our interest in developing (186)Re- and (188)Re-based therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals led to investigation of a new Re(V)-cyclized octreotide analogue, Re(V)-cyclized, thiolated-DPhe(1)-Cys(2)-(3)-DTrp(4)-(5)-(6)-Cys(7)-(OH)(8) (Re-SDPhe-TATE) using both experimental and quantum chemical methods. The metal is directly coordinated to SDPhe-TATE through cyclization of the peptide around the [ReO](3+) core. Upon complexation, four isomers were observed; the isolated/semi-isolated isomers exhibited different somatostatin receptor (sstr) binding affinities, 0.13 to 1.5 μM, in rat pancreatic tumor cells. Two-dimensional NMR experiments and electronic structure calculations were employed to elucidate the structural differences among the different isomers. According to NMR studies, the metal is coordinated to three thiolates and the backbone amide of Cys(2) in isomers 1 and 4, whereas the metal is coordinated to three thiolates and the backbone amide of (3) in isomer 2. Quantum chemical methods clarified the stereochemistry of Re-SDPhe-TATE and the possible peptide arrangements around the [ReO](3+) core. The re-cyclization reaction was translated to the (99m)Tc radiotracer level with four isomers observed on complexation with comparable HPLC retention times as the Re-SDPhe-TATE isomers. About 85% total (99m)Tc labeling yield was achieved by ligand exchange from (99m)Tc-glucoheptonate at 60 °C for an hour. About 100% and 51% of (99m)Tc(V)-cyclized SDPhe-TATE remained intact in phosphate buffered saline and 1 mM cysteine solution under physiological conditions at 6 h, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26706905>Interaction of Quercetin of Onion with Axon Guidance Protein Receptor, NRP-1 Plays Important Role in Cancer Treatment: An In Silico Approach.</a></h1><p>Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor whose distinct sites bind semaphorins and vascular endothelial growth factor family members to mediate the role of these ligands in neuronal axon guidance and angiogenesis, respectively. Similarly, Eph receptors and ephrin ligands play critical roles in various biological functions, and deregulated activation of Eph/ephrin signaling in humans is thought to lead to tumorigenesis. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt was made to elucidate the inhibition potential of nine bioactive compounds from four different native spices of Bangladesh against this couple of receptors via molecular docking study. The molecular docking study was carried out using Vina docking protocol. Finally, the receptor-ligand interaction analysis was carried out using the Discovery Studio Client package. Quercetin and diosgenin of onion showed favorable binding with NRP-1 with low binding energy of -7.8 and -7.2 kcal/mol, respectively, in comparison with the control inhibitor (-6.1 kcal/mol). The study suggests that ligand interaction with the residues Asp 48,  44,  77,  81, Trp29, Ile 143 of NRP-1 and  653, Phe 765, Ser 763,  699, Ile 683 of Eph might be critical for the inhibitory activity of these receptors. The study provides evidence for consideration of quercetin and diosgenin of onion as valuable small ligand molecules for targeting NRP-1 receptor in treatment and prevention of neurological disorders as well as cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25575595>Characterization of the pivotal carbon  of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 under ex vivo and chemically defined in vitro conditions by isotopologue profiling.</a></h1><p>Streptococcus suis is a neglected zoonotic pathogen that has to adapt to the nutritional requirements in the different host niches encountered during infection and establishment of invasive diseases. To dissect the central  activity of S. suis under different conditions of nutrient availability, we performed labeling experiments starting from [(13)C]glucose specimens and analyzed the resulting isotopologue patterns in amino acids of S. suis grown under in vitro and ex vivo conditions. In combination with classical growth experiments, we found that S. suis is auxotrophic for Arg, Gln/Glu, His, Leu, and Trp in chemically defined medium. De novo biosynthesis was shown for Ala, Asp, Ser, and  at high rates and for Gly, , Phe, , and Val at moderate or low rates, respectively. Glucose degradation occurred mainly by glycolysis and to a minor extent by the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, the exclusive formation of oxaloacetate by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylation became evident from the patterns in de novo synthesized amino acids. Labeling experiments with S. suis grown ex vivo in blood or cerebrospinal fluid reflected the  adaptation to these host niches with different nutrient availability; however, similar key  activities were identified under these conditions. This points at the robustness of the core   in S. suis during the infection process. The crucial role of PEP carboxylation for growth of S. suis in the host was supported by experiments with a PEP carboxylase-deficient mutant strain in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28864614>Somatostatin Receptor Antagonists for Imaging and Therapy.</a></h1><p>Somatostatin receptor (sstr) scintigraphy for imaging and sstr analogs for treatment have been used for more than 20 y. An important improvement in recent years was the introduction of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with radiolabeled sstr agonists, such as [Y-DOTA,]octreotide or [Lu-DOTA,]octreotide (Y- or Lu-DOTATOC, respectively) and [Lu-DOTA,]octreotate (Lu-DOTATATE). PET/CT with Ga-labeled sstr agonists, such as Ga-DOTATOC, Ga-DOTATATE, and [Ga-DOTA,1-Nal]octreotide (Ga-DOTANOC), plays an important role in staging and restaging neuroendocrine tumors. Most importantly, sstr scintigraphy and sstr PET/CT can distinguish patients who will qualify for and benefit from peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. This characteristic of sstr targeting is important because it allows a personalized treatment approach (theranostic approach). Until recently, it was thought that internalization of the radiolabeled agonist was mandatory for sstr-mediated imaging and therapy. It was Ginj et al. who proposed in 2006 the paradigm shift that radiolabeled sstr antagonists may perform better than agonists despite the lack of internalization. Despite the rather limited number of head-to-head comparisons of sstr antagonists and agonists, the superiority of sstr antagonists was demonstrated in several cases. From a small library of sstr antagonists, the analog JR11 (Cpa-c[d-Cys-Aph(Hor)-d-Aph(Cbm)---Cys]-d--NH), an antagonist with selectivity for sstr subtype 2, showed the best overall characteristics for sstr subtype 2 targeting and was therefore selected for clinical translation. JR11 is under clinical development as a PET imaging agent when labeled with Ga (Ga-NODAGA-JR11 or Ga-OPS202) and as a therapeutic agent when labeled with Lu (Lu-DOTA-JR11 or Lu-OPS201). In this article, we discuss the development and current status of radiolabeled sstr antagonists. Evidence based on preclinical work, on quantitative in vivo autoradiography of human tumor slices, and on human data now supports a shift to sstr antagonists.© 2017 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30412382>NOTA and NODAGA [Tc]Tc- and [Re]Re-Tricarbonyl Complexes: Radiochemistry and First Example of a [Tc]Tc-NODAGA Somatostatin Receptor-Targeting Bioconjugate.</a></h1><p>With the long-term goal of developing theranostic agents for applications in nuclear medicine, in this work we evaluated the well-known NOTA and NODAGA chelators as bifunctional chelators (BFCs) for the [Tc/Re]Tc/Re-tricarbonyl core. In particular, we report model complexes of the general formula fac-[M(L)(CO)] (M = Re, Tc, Re) where L denotes NOTA-Pyr (1) or NODAGA-Pyr (2), which are derived from conjugation of NOTA/NODAGA with pyrrolidine (Pyr). Further, as proof-of-principle, we synthesized the peptide bioconjugate NODAGA-sst-ANT (3) and explored its complexation with the fac-[Re(CO)] and fac-[Tc][Tc(CO)] cores; sst-ANT denotes the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) antagonist 4-NO-Phe-c(DCys--DTrp---Cys)-DTyr-NH. Rhenium complexes Re-1 through Re-3 were synthesized and characterized spectroscopically, and receptor binding affinity was demonstrated for Re-3 in SSTR-expressing cells (AR42J, IC = 91 nM). Radiolabeled complexes [Tc]Tc/[Re]Re-1/2 and [Tc]Tc-3 were prepared in high radiochemical yield (>90%, determined by radio-HPLC) by reacting [Tc]/[Re][Tc/Re(OH)(CO)] with 1-3 and correlated well with the respective Re-1 through Re-3 standards in comparative HPLC studies. All radiotracers remained intact through 24 h (Tc-labeled complexes) or 48 h (Re-labeled complexes) against 1 mM l-histidine and 1 mM l-cysteine (pH 7.4, 37 °C). Similarly, rat serum stability studies displayed no decomposition and low nonspecific binding of 9-24% through 4 h. Biodistribution of [Tc]Tc-3 in healthy CF-1 mice demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Rapid clearance was observed within 1 h post-injection, predominantly via the renal system (82% of the injected dose was excreted in urine by 1 h), with low kidney retention (% ID/g: 11 at 1 h, 5 at 4 h, and 1 at 24 h) and low nonspecific uptake in other organs/tissues. Our findings establish NOTA and NODAGA as outstanding BFCs for the fac-[M(CO)] core in the design and development of organometallic radiopharmaceuticals. Future in vivo studies of [Tc]Tc- and [Re]Re-tricarbonyl complexes of NODAGA/NOTA-biomolecule conjugates will further probe the potential of these chelates for nuclear medicine applications in diagnostic imaging and targeted radiotherapy, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29490036>Cloning and characterization of the novel d-aspartyl endopeptidase, paenidase, from Paenibacillus sp. B38.</a></h1><p>Paenidase is the first micro-organism-derived d-aspartyl endopeptidase that specifically recognizes an internal d-Asp residue to cleave [d-Asp]-X peptide bonds. Using peptide sequences obtained from the protein, we performed PCR with degenerate primers to amplify the paenidase I-encoding gene. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that mature paenidase I consist of 322 amino acid residues and that the protein is encoded as a pro-protein with a 197-amino-acid N-terminal extension compared to the mature protein. Paenidase I exhibits amino acid sequence similarity to several penicillin-binding proteins. In addition, paenidase I was classified into peptidase family S12 based on a MEROPS database search. Family S12 contains serine-type d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidases that have three active site residues (Ser,  and ) in the conserved motifs Ser-Xaa-- and -Xaa-Asn. These motifs were conserved in the primary structure of paenidase I, and the role of these residues was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959521>Meta-regression analysis to predict the influence of branched-chain and large neutral amino acids on growth performance of pigs1.</a></h1><p>A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), their interactions, and interactions with large neutral amino acids (LNAA) to develop prediction equations for growth performance of pigs. Data from 25 papers, published from 1995 to 2018, for a total of 44 trials and 210 observations were recorded in a database. Diets were reformulated using the NRC (2012) loading values to estimate nutrient concentrations. The response variables were average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F). The predictor variables tested included average body weight (BW), crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, Ile:, Leu:, Val:, BCAA:, Ile:Leu, Val:Leu, Ile:Val, (Ile+Val):Leu, Trp:, Leu:Trp, Ile:Trp, Val:Trp, BCAA:Trp, Met:, Leu:Met, Ile:Met, Val:Met, BCAA:Met, His:, Leu:His, Ile:His, Val:His, BCAA:His, :, Leu:, Ile:, Val:, BCAA:, (Phe+):, Leu:(Phe+), Ile:(Phe+), Val:(Phe+), BCAA:(Phe+), LNAA:, Leu:LNAA, Ile:LNAA, Val:LNAA, and BCAA:LNAA. Amino acids were expressed on standardized ileal digestible basis. The MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to develop the equations. The inverse of squared SEM was used to account for heterogeneous errors using the WEIGHT statement. Models were selected with a step-wise manual forward selection. In order to be included in the final model, predictor variables had to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) and provide an improvement of at least 2 points in Bayesian information criterion. The optimum equations were: ADG, g = - 985.94 + (15.2499 × average BW (kg)) - (0.08885 × average BW × average BW) + (1.063 × Leu:) + (20.2659 × Ile:) - (0.1479 × Ile: × Ile:) + (9.2243 × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.03321 × (Ile+Val):Leu × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.4413 × Ile:Trp); G:F, g/kg = 648.3 - (6.2974 × average BW (kg)) + (0.02051 × average BW × average BW) + (0.5396 × Ile:) + (1.7284 × Val:) - (0.00795 × Val: × Val:) - (1.7594 × Met:); and ADFI, kg = predicted ADG/predicted G:F. Overall, the prediction equations suggest that increasing Leu: negatively impacts ADG due to a reduction in G:F and ADFI caused by insufficient levels of other BCAA and LNAA relative to Leu. According to the model, the addition of Val, Ile, and Trp, alone or in combination, has the potential to counteract the negative effects of high dietary Leu concentrations on growth performance.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, preventing CA infection in these patients is still a daunting challenge. Herein, inspired from the fact that immunization with secreted aspartyl proteinases 2 (Sap2) can prevent the infection, it is proposed to use filamentous phage, a human-safe virus nanofiber specifically infecting bacteria (≈900 nm long and 7 nm wide), to display an epitope peptide of Sap2 (EPS, with a sequence of Val----Ser) on its side wall and thus serve as a vaccine for preventing CA infection. The engineered virus nanofibers and recombinant Sap2 (rSap2) are then separately used to immunize mice. The humoral and cellular immune responses in the immunized mice are evaluated. Surprisingly, the virus nanofibers significantly induce mice to produce strong immune response as rSap2 and generate antibodies that can bind Sap2 and CA to inhibit the CA infection. Consequently, immunization with the virus nanofibers in mice dramatically increases the survival rate of CA-infected mice. All these results, along with the fact that the virus nanofibers can be mass-produced by infecting bacteria cost-effectively, suggest that virus nanofibers displaying EPS can be a vaccine candidate against fungal infection.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We show that IQ irreversibly inactivates Mycobacterium tuberculosis shikimate kinase (MtSK) through covalent modification of the protein. Inactivation occurred with an apparent second-order rate constant of about 60 M s. Following reaction with IQ, LC-MS analyses of intact MtSK revealed covalent modification of MtSK by IQ, with the concomitant loss of a methoxy group, suggesting a Michael-addition mechanism. Evaluation of tryptic fragments of IQ-derivatized MtSK by MS/MS demonstrated that Ser and  residues were most frequently modified with lesser involvement of  and . In or near the MtSK active site, three residues of the P-loop (K15, S16, and T17) as well as S77, T111, and S44 showed evidence of IQ-dependent derivatization. Accordingly, inclusion of ATP in IQ reactions with MtSK partially protected the enzyme from inactivation and limited IQ-based derivatization of K15 and S16. Additionally, molecular docking models for MtSK-IQ were generated for IQ-derivatized S77 and T111. In the latter, ATP was observed to sterically clash with the IQ moiety. Out of three other enzymes evaluated, lactate dehydrogenase was derivatized and inactivated by IQ, but pyruvate kinase and catalase-peroxidase (KatG) were unaffected. Together, these data suggest that IQ is promiscuous (though not entirely indiscriminant) in its reactivity. As such, the potential of IQ as a lead in the development of antitubercular agents directed against MtSK or other targets is questionable.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the protein hydrolysate of hairtail muscle (HTP) was prepared using binary-enzymes hydrolysis process (papain + alcalase). Subsequently, eight antioxidant peptides were purified from HTP using membrane ultrafiltration and chromatography technology, and their amino acid sequences were identified as Gln-Asn-Asp-Glu-Arg (TJP1), -Ser (TJP2), -Ala (TJP3), Ala--Gly (TJP4), --Ala (TJP5), Val- (TJP6), Met- (TJP7), and Ile--Gly (TJP8) with molecular weights of 660.3, 233.0, 217.1, 274.1, 318.0, 245.1, 277.0, and 351.0 Da, respectively. TJP3, TJP4, and TJP8 exhibited strong scavenging activities on DPPH• (EC 0.902, 0.626, and 0.663 mg/mL, respectively), HO• (EC 1.740, 2.378, and 2.498 mg/mL, respectively), superoxide anion radical (EC 2.082, 2.538, and 1.355 mg/mL, respectively), and 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical (EC 1.652, 0.831, and 0.586 mg/mL, respectively). Moreover, TJP3, TJP4, and TJP8 showed higher reducing power and inhibiting ability on lipid peroxidation in a linoleic acid model system.

Ala-based tetra- and pentapeptides were designed, and the N- or C-terminal amino acid residues were replaced by different amino acids. The results showed that the oligopeptides had a wide range of transport permeability across the Caco-2 cell monolayer and could be divided into four categories: non-/poor permeability, low permeability, intermediate permeability, and good permeability. Tetrapeptides with N-terminal Leu, Pro, Ile, Cys, Met, and Val or C-terminal Val showed the highest permeability, with apparent permeability coefficient (P) values over 10 × 10 cm/s (p < 0.05), suggesting that nonpolar hydrophobic aliphatic amino acids or polar sulfur-containing amino acids were the best for the transport of tetrapeptides. Pentapeptides with N- or C-terminal  also showed high permeability levels, with P values of about 10 × 10 cm/s. The amino acids Glu, Asn, and  at the N terminus or , Asp, and Arg at the C terminus were also beneficial for the transport of tetra- and pentapeptides, with P values ranging from 1 × 10 to 10 × 10 cm/s. In addition, peptides with amino acids replaced at the N terminus generally showed higher permeability than those with amino acids replaced at the C terminus (p < 0.05), suggesting that N-terminal amino acids were more important for the transport of oligopeptides across the Caco-2 cell monolayer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29668724>The somatostatin receptor 2 antagonist 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 outperforms 64Cu-DOTA-TATE in a mouse xenograft model.</a></h1><p>Copper-64 is an attractive radionuclide for PET imaging and is frequently used in clinical applications. The aim of this study was to perform a side-by-side comparison of the in vitro and in vivo performance of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (NODAGA = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid,4,7-acetic acid, JR11 = p-Cl-Phe-cyclo(D-Cys-Aph(Hor)-D-Aph(cbm)---Cys)D--NH2), a somatostatin receptor 2 antagonist, with the clinically used sst2 agonist 64Cu-DOTA-TATE ((TATE = D-Phe-cyclo(Cys--D-Trp---Cys)). In vitro studies demonstrated Kd values of 5.7±0.95 nM (Bmax = 4.1±0.18 nM) for the antagonist 64/natCu-NODAGA-JR11 and 20.1±4.4. nM (Bmax = 0.48±0.18 nM) for the agonist 64/natCu-DOTA-TATE. Cell uptake studies showed the expected differences between agonists and antagonists. Whereas 64Cu-DOTA-TATE (the agonist) showed very effective internalization in the cell culture assay (with 50% internalized at 4 hours post-peptide addition under the given experimental conditions), 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (the antagonist) showed little internalization but strong receptor-mediated uptake at the cell membrane. Biodistribution studies of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 showed rapid blood clearance and tumor uptake with increasing tumor-to-relevant organ ratios within the first 4 hours and in some cases, 24 hours, respectively. The tumor washout was slow or non-existent in the first 4 hours, whereas the kidney washout was very efficient, leading to high and increasing tumor-to-kidney ratios over time. Specificity of tumor uptake was proven by co-injection of high excess of non-radiolabeled peptide, which led to >80% tumor blocking. 64Cu-DOTA-TATE showed less favorable pharmacokinetics, with the exception of lower kidney uptake. Blood clearance was distinctly slower and persistent higher blood values were found at 24 hours. Uptake in the liver and lung was relatively high and also persistent. The tumor uptake was specific and similar to that of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 at 1 h, but release from the tumor was very fast, particularly between 4 and 24 hours. Tumor-to-normal organ ratios were distinctly lower after 1 hour. This is indicative of insufficient in vivo stability. PET studies of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 reflected the biodistribution data with nicely delineated tumor and low background. 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 shows promising pharmacokinetic properties for further translation into the clinic.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29077891>Investigating the effect of dietary calcium levels on ileal endogenous amino acid losses and standardized ileal amino acid digestibility in broilers and laying hens.</a></h1><p>Two studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary Ca levels (low, 1% and high, 3%) on ileal endogenous amino acid losses (IEAAL) and standardized ileal amino acid digestibility (SIAAD) in broilers (BR) and laying hens (LH) fed nitrogen-free diets (NFD) and distiller's dried grain with solubles (DDGS)-based diets. A total of 384 male Cobb 500 BR and 288 LH were used in a completely randomized design (CRD) with 16 (BR) or 12 (LH) replicate cages with 6 birds/replicate. IEAAL and apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of AA were analyzed using the GLM procedure of SAS appropriate for a CRD while SIAAD values were analyzed using the GLM procedure of SAS appropriate for a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. For BR, IEAAL and N losses (mg/kg of dry matter intake, DMI) were higher (P < 0.05) when NFD with high Ca level was fed (total AA was 39%, N was 35% higher). For most of the AA, AID was higher (P < 0.05) in BR fed DDGS-based diet with high Ca level. High dietary Ca resulted in higher (P < 0.05) SIAAD for all the AA except for Arg, , Met, Cys, and . For LH, AID of AA was higher (P < 0.05) for the DDGS diet with high Ca level in 13 of the 18 AA evaluated. There was interaction (P < 0.05) between diet Ca level and correction method on LH SIAAD values for , Asp, Gly, and Ser. The SIAAD values for 8 AA were higher (P < 0.05) in birds on high Ca DDGS diet. Correction with low Ca NFD resulted in higher (P < 0.05) SIAAD values for all the AA. Result from this study showed that high Ca increased total IEAAL in BR by 39% but decreased same by 27% in LH. Finally, SIAAD values were increased in BR fed high Ca DDGS-based diet while SIAAD value in LH was lower when correction was done using values from high Ca-NFD fed birds.© 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27156249>KE108-conjugated unimolecular micelles loaded with a novel HDAC inhibitor thailandepsin-A for targeted neuroendocrine cancer therapy.</a></h1><p>Neuroendocrine (NE) cancers can cause significant patient morbidity. Besides surgery, there are no curative treatments for NE cancers and their metastases, emphasizing the need for the development of other forms of therapy. In this study, multifunctional unimolecular micelles were developed for targeted NE cancer therapy. The unimolecular micelles were formed by multi-arm star amphiphilic block copolymer poly(amidoamine)-poly(valerolactone)-poly(ethylene glycol) conjugated with KE108 peptide and Cy5 dye (abbreviated as PAMAM-PVL-PEG-KE108/Cy5). The unimolecular micelles with a spherical core-shell structure exhibited a uniform size distribution and excellent stability. The hydrophobic drug thailandepsin-A (TDP-A), a recently discovered HDAC inhibitor, was physically encapsulated into the hydrophobic core of the micelles. KE108 peptide, a somatostatin analog possessing high affinity for all five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR 1-5), commonly overexpressed in NE cancer cells, was used for the first time as an NE cancer targeting ligand. KE108 exhibited superior targeting abilities compared to other common somatostatin analogs, such as octreotide, in NE cancer cell lines. The in vitro assays demonstrated that the TDP-A-loaded, KE108-targeted micelles exhibited the best capabilities in suppressing NE cancer cell growth. Moreover, the in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging on NE-tumor-bearing nude mice showed that KE108-conjugated micelles exhibited the greatest tumor accumulation due to their passive targeting and active targeting capabilities. Finally, TDP-A-loaded and KE108-conjugated micelles possessed the best anticancer efficacy without detectable systemic toxicity. Thus, these novel TDP-A-loaded and KE108-conjugated unimolecular micelles offer a promising approach for targeted NE cancer therapy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To further investigate the role of the Gly-Gly pairs, 11 double-replacement mutants were constructed for each pair at positions 46 (helix II) and 262 (helix VIII). Replacement with Ala or Ser results in decreased but significant transport activity, while replacements with , Val, Leu, Asn, Gln, , Trp, Glu, or  exhibit very little or no transport. Remarkably, however, the double mutants bind galactoside with affinities 10-20-fold higher than that of the pseudo-WT or WT LacY. Moreover, site-directed alkylation of a periplasmic Cys replacement indicates that the periplasmic cavity becomes readily accessible in the double-replacement mutants. Molecular dynamics simulations with the WT and double-Leu mutant in the inward-open/outward-closed conformation provide support for this interpretation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31074782>Available  and amino acid digestibility of yellow dent corn fed to growing pigs1.</a></h1><p>Two experiments were conducted to determine the DE and ME as well as the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in corn fed to growing pigs. All corn was yellow dent corn collected from different areas in China. In Exp. 1, 60 crossbred barrows (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire; 40.7 ± 3.5 kg BW) were randomly allotted to 1 of 10 diets to determine the DE and ME of corns. Diets were formulated to contain 96.8% of 1 of the 10 corn samples and 3.2% of other microingredients. In Exp. 2, 11 crossbred barrows (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire; 30.5 ± 2.3 kg) fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum were assigned to a 6 × 11 Youden square design with 6 periods and 11 diets. Diets included a N-free diet based on cornstarch and sucrose and 10 test diets formulated with 96.6% 1 of the 10 corns as the sole source of AA. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was added to each diet as an indigestible marker for calculating the AA digestibility. On a DM basis, the starch, ether extract (EE), CP, NDF, and ADF contents of corns averaged 74.05% (69.98 to 78.59%), 3.83% (2.04 to 4.73%), 9.63% (7.74 to 10.43%), 10.80% (10.27 to 11.46%), and 2.27% (2.03 to 2.57%), respectively. The CV of EE, CP, and ADF was 22.59, 8.22, and 8.21%, respectively. The DE and ME of corns averaged 4,087 and 3,981 kcal/kg, respectively, and ranged from 3,999 to 4,161 kcal/kg and from 3,898 to 4,067 kcal/kg, respectively. The DE and ME values were positively correlated (P < 0.05) with the EE content. Optimal prediction equations of ME were ME = 940.35 + (0.72 × DE) + (21.88 × EE) (R2 = 0.94) or ME = 1,051.50 + (0.82 × DE) - (282.05 × ash) (R2 = 0.99). In Exp. 2, significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed in the SID of Arg, His, Phe, Ala, Pro, Cys, and . The SID of  (average 73.79%), Met (average 87.32%), and  (average 80.06%) ranged from 61.45 to 78.47%, from 74.09 to 90.91%, and from 79.19 to 85.79%, respectively. The standardized ileal digestible Met was positively correlated (P < 0.01) with the Met and CP contents. The obtained prediction equations were standardized ileal digestible Met = 31.34 + (3.43 × CP) + (116.04 × Met) and standardized ileal digestible Met = 104.92 + (294.71 × Met) - (7.03 × NDF). In conclusion, sources had an effect on the  values and ileal digestibility of most AA in corn. The ME can be predicted by the DE combined with either the EE or ash content. The AA concentrations and SID of AA in corn varied largely.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.

One-day-old broiler chickens (n = 480) were randomly allocated to 4 treatments with 6 replicates of 20 chicks each for diets containing YCW at 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g/kg. The results showed that YCW supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ADFI and ADG by 15.3% and 16.0%, respectively, and the 2 higher doses of YCW had greater effects (P < 0.05) than the lower dose. For the glutathione pathway in the duodenal mucosa, the levels of reduced glutathione and glutathione reductase in the YCW treatments were increased (P < 0.05) by 15.6% and 17.4%, respectively, but glutathione S-transferases was not affected. Similarly, the YCW increased (P < 0.05) the mucosal activities of trypsin, dipeptidyl, and leucine aminopeptidase by 12.4%, 5.5%, and 17.3%, respectively, and the mRNA profiles of neutral, cationic, and oligopeptide transporters by 62.5%, 69.1%, and 11.5%, respectively. The YCW also increased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of , Met, Ile, Leu, , Arg, and  in the blood by 8.8% to 39.2%. Additionally, the ADFI, ADG, reduced glutathione, trypsin, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, leucine aminopeptidase, and cationic amino acid transporter increased linearly and quadratically (P < 0.05) with YCW supplementation. The results suggest that YCW supplementation can beneficially modulate intestinal glutathione pathway, proteolytic enzyme activity, and nutrient transport in growing animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28799334>The Impact of Commonly Used Alkylating Agents on Artifactual Peptide Modification.</a></h1><p>Iodoacetamide is by far the most commonly used agent for alkylation of cysteine during sample preparation for proteomics. An alternative, 2-chloroacetamide, has recently been suggested to reduce the alkylation of residues other than cysteine, such as the N-terminus, Asp, Glu, , Ser, , and . Here we show that although 2-chloroacetamide reduces the level of off-target alkylation, it exhibits a range of adverse effects. The most significant of these is methionine oxidation, which increases to a maximum of 40% of all Met-containing peptides, compared with 2-5% with iodoacetamide. Increases were also observed for mono- and dioxidized tryptophan. No additional differences between the alkylating reagents were observed for a range of other post-translational modifications and digestion parameters. The deleterious effects were observed for 2-chloroacetamide from three separate suppliers. The adverse impact of 2-chloroacetamide on methionine oxidation suggests that it is not the ideal alkylating reagent for proteomics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849491>Synthesis of N-Chloroamino Acids and Their Biological Activities in LPS Stimulated RAW 264.7 Cells.</a></h1><p>Amino acids (AAs) are essential for protein synthesis, neurotransmission and macro molecule biosynthesis. Ala, Gln, Gly, , Val and taurine (Tau) are the most abundant free AAs in mammals, and some of these react with hypochlorite (HOCl/OCl) produced by myeloperoxidase in activated phagocytes to form N-chloroamino acids (NCAA). In this study, we reacted 20 AAs and Tau with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), then classified the products into five types (I-V) based on the change in their absorbance. Type I AAs (Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, Ile, , Phe, Ser, Tau,  and Val) generated a typical monochloramine peak at 252 nm, while Type II AAs (Asn and ) and Type III AAs (Glu and Leu) produced peaks at 275 nm and 225 nm, respectively. The Type IV AAs (His, Met and Trp) did not show any distinct absorption peak, and Type V AAs (Asp, Cys and Pro) did not appear to react with NaOCl. The ArgCl and TauCl were stable, while GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, PheCl and ValCl were less stable and AlaCl, SerCl and ThrCl were the least stable. Tau is the most abundant non-proteinogenic free AA in cellular fluid and has many physiological functions in the nervous, cardiovascular, renal and immune systems. Tau reacts with HOCl to form TauCl, which inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators such as superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and interleukins, while increasing the antioxidant proteins in macrophages. We determined the effects of Type I NCAA on cell viability, NO and TNF-α production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. All Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited LPS-induced NO production. However, only GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, SerCl and TauCl inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production. In summary, Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited NO production, while their effects on TNF-α varied. Our results suggest that Type I NCAA may serve as biological regulators similar to TauCl during inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25666040>Peptides as modulators of α-synuclein aggregation.</a></h1><p>α-Synuclein forms amyloid deposits in the dopaminergic neurons; a process that is believed to contribute to the Parkinson's disease. An emerging theme in amyloid research is the hypothesis that the toxic species produced during amyloid formation share common physic-chemical features and exert their effects by common modes. This prompted the idea that molecules able to inhibit a protein aggregation process may cross-react with other amyloidogenic proteins, interfering in their fibrils formation. We investigate the ability of analogues of the heptapeptide H-Arg--Val-MePhe---Trp- OH2, an inhibitor of Aβ-peptide aggregation, to cross-react with α-synuclein interfering with its fibril formation. The influence of the MePhe topography on the interaction with α-synuclein has also been evaluated, replacing the MePhe residue with either Phe or the conformationally restricted Tic residues. Peptides interact with good affinity with the α-synuclein monomer, promoting its aggregation process. This work provides the basis for the development of new drugs based on peptidomimetics able to modify the oligomers - mature fibrils equilibrium towards this last species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27482670>Effect of heat stress on the serum concentrations of free amino acids and some of their metabolites in growing pigs.</a></h1><p>Exposure to heat stress (HS) may affect the intestinal epithelia of pigs, resulting in impaired digestive and absorptive capacity. The serum concentration (SC) of free AA in pigs can be used as indicators of their availability. This study was conducted with 12 crossbred (Landrace × Hampshire × Duroc) pigs (29.0 ± 2.8 kg initial BW) distributed into 2 groups to analyze the SC of free AA and some AA metabolites in pigs exposed to HS conditions. The treatments were pigs housed under natural HS conditions in a room with no ambient temperature control (23.6 to 37.6°C, HS) and pigs housed at thermoneutral conditions (24 ± 2°C), feed restricted to a level similar to that of their HS counterparts. All pigs received a wheat-soybean meal diet. Blood samples were collected at both the absorptive (2.5 h after a meal) and postabsorptive (10.0 h after a meal) phase. At the absorptive phase, the SC of free Arg, Leu, , Phe, , and Trp were lower ( < 0.05) and the SC of His, Val, Ala, Pro, Ser, and  tended to be lower ( < 0.10) in HS pigs. At the postabsorptive phase, the SC of free Arg, His, Met, Asn, Gln, and  were higher ( < 0.05) but the SC of Ala was lower ( < 0.01) and the SC of Pro tended to be lower ( < 0.10) in HS pigs. The absorptive SC of carnosine, ornithine (Orn), and Tau were lower ( < 0.05) and of citrulline (Cit), cystathionine, and urea tended to be lower ( < 0.10) in HS pigs. The postabsorptive SC of 3-methyl-His, homo-Cys, OH-, and OH-Pro increased ( = 0.05) and of Cit tended to increase ( = 0.10) but that of carnosine and sarcosine ( < 0.05) decreased in HS pigs. The results of this study show a marked and differential effect of HS on the SC of AA. These data indicate that HS negatively affects the digestive and absorptive capacity of pigs and that the  of some AA is modified in pigs to counteract the negative effects of the HS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25568365>The efficacy of a new 6-phytase obtained from Buttiauxella spp. expressed in Trichoderma reesei on digestibility of amino acids, energy, and nutrients in pigs fed a diet based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers' dried grains with solubles.</a></h1><p>Sixteen cannulated pigs were used to evaluate the effect of a new 6-phytase derived from Buttiauxella spp. and expressed in Trichoderma reesei on apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of AA and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, N, Ca, P, Na, Mg, K, Cl, and energy. Pigs were fed 4 diets for 2 periods in a crossover design. Within each period, there were 4 blocks of 4 pigs per block with each diet represented within each block. The average initial BW in periods 1 and 2 were 22 and 30 kg, respectively. Each period lasted 9 d with fecal collection on d 5 and 6 and a 12-h ileal digesta collection on d 7, 8, and 9. Pigs received a daily feed allowance of approximately 4.5% of their BW. The experimental diets were based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers dried grain with solubles. Phytase was added at 0; 500; 1,000; or 2,000 phytase units/kg of diet to a basal diet that contained 205, 15, 5.4, and 10 g of CP, , total P (1.6 g of nonphytate P), and Ca/kg diet, respectively. The addition of phytase improved (P < 0.05) AID of DM, N, Ca, and P. Increasing phytase supplementation linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.05) AID of P and Ca, respectively, with AID of Ca showing a tendency for a linear increase (P = 0.053). Phytase supplementation of the basal diet improved (P < 0.05) AID of P from 46 to 62%. Phytase supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ATTD of DM, N, Ca, P, Mg, K, and energy. Contrasts showed that phytase supplementation of the basal diet increased (P < 0.05) AID for 8 indispensable AA (Arg, His, Ile, Leu, , Phe, , and Val), 6 dispensable AA (Ala, Asp, Cys, Glu, Ser, and ), as well as for total AA. Furthermore, phytase supplementation to the basal diet showed a tendency (P < 0.10) to increase ileal digestibility of Gly. Ileal digestibility of Met, Trp, and Pro were not affected by phytase supplementation. Increasing the level of phytase supplementation resulted in linear increases (P < 0.05) in AID of 6 indispensable AA (Arg, Ile, Leu, , Phe, and Val) and 1 dispensable AA (Asp) with 4 AA (His, Cys, Glu, and ) showing a tendency for linear increase (P < 0.10) in AID of AA. The results from this study showed that in addition to increasing P and Ca utilization, the new Buttiauxella 6-phytase expressed in Trichoderma reesei enhanced ileal digestibility of N and several AA in growing pigs in a dose-dependent manner.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29287398>Exploration of the molecular interactions between angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) and the inhibitory peptides derived from hazelnut (Corylus heterophylla Fisch.).</a></h1><p>The mechanism of action of food-derived angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides has not been completely elucidated. In the present study, ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography, and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass (LC-ESI-MS/MS) were employed for purifying and identifying the ACE inhibitory peptides from hazelnut. To understand the mode of action of these peptides, ACE inhibition kinetics, in vitro and in vivo bioavailability assays, active site analysis, and interaction between the inhibitory peptides and ACE were investigated. The results identified novel ACE inhibitory peptides Ala-Val--Val-Leu (AVKVL), -Leu-Val-Arg (YLVR), and -Leu-Val-Gly-Arg (TLVGR) with IC values of 73.06, 15.42, and 249.3 μM, respectively. All peptides inhibited the ACE activity via a non-competitive mode. The binding free energies of AVKVL, YLVR, and TLVGR for ACE were -3.46, -6.48, and -7.37 kcal/mol, respectively. The strong inhibition of ACE by YLVR may be attributed to the formation of cation-pi interactions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we demonstrated that inhibiting expression of the rice amino acid transporter OsAAP3 increased grain yield due to a formation of larger numbers of tillers as a result of increased bud outgrowth. Elevated expression of OsAAP3 in transgenic plants resulted in significantly higher amino acid concentrations of , Arg, His, Asp, Ala, Gln, Gly,  and , and inhibited bud outgrowth and rice tillering. However, RNAi of OsAAP3 decreased significantly Arg, , Asp and  concentrations to a small extent, and thus promoted bud outgrowth, increased significantly tiller numbers and effective panicle numbers per plant, and further enhanced significantly grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The promoter sequences of OsAAP3 showed some divergence between Japonica and Indica rice, and expression of the gene was higher in Japonica, which produced fewer tillers than Indica. We generated knockout lines of OsAAP3 on Japonica ZH11 and KY131 using CRISPR technology and found that grain yield could be increased significantly. These results suggest that manipulation of OsAAP3 expression could be used to increase grain yield in rice.© 2018 The Authors.

The amino acid consumption and necessary patterns of S. thermophilus T1C2 were investigated in the complete chemically defined medium. For amino acid consumption profiles throughout the growth of S. thermophilus T1C2, the most abundantly consumed amino acids were Gln and Arg, which accounted for 19 and 20% of total amino acids consumed, respectively. Asparagine, , Ser, Ala, Val, Met, Leu, and , consumptions of which ranged from 3 to 10% of total amino acids consumed, were the second most intensively consumed amino acids. For necessary amino acid patterns, the amount of Cys, which counted for 11% of total amino acids needed, was significantly higher than the amounts required for other amino acids in growth of S. thermophilus T1C2. The necessary amounts of Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Arg, Ala, Met, and  ranked second, ranging from 5 to 8% of total amino acids needed. Compared with necessary amounts, the consumption of Asn, , Ser, Gln, Arg, Ala, Val, Leu, , His, and Phe exceeded the necessary amounts for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 remarkably. Consumption of Gly, Met, Ile, Trp, and Pro was slightly higher than the necessary amounts. Consumption of Asp, Glu, , and Cys was lower than the necessary amounts. The overall consumption of amino acids exceeded the required amount for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 almost 2.43 times, which implied a significant nitrogen wasting.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

The monosaccharide is non-enzymatically converted to 4-deoxy-L-ery thro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid (DEH), then reduced to 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate (KDG) by a specific reductase, and metabolized through the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Recently, the NADPH-dependent reductase A1-R that belongs to short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) superfamily was identified as the DEH-reductase in Sphingomonas sp. A1. We have subsequently noticed that an SDR-like enzyme gene, flred, occurred in the genome of an alginolytic bacterium Flavobacterium sp. strain UMI-01. In the present study, we report on the deduced amino-acid sequence of flred and DEH-reducing activity of recombinant FlRed. The deduced amino-acid sequence of flred comprised 254 residues and showed 34% amino-acid identities to that of A1-R from Sphingomonas sp. A1 and 80%-88% to those of SDR-like enzymes from several alginolytic bacteria. Common sequence motifs of SDR-superfamily enzymes, e.g., the catalytic tetrad Asn---Ser and the cofactor-binding sequence -Gly-x-x-x-Gly-x-Gly in Rossmann fold, were completely conserved in FlRed. On the other hand, an Arg residue that determined the NADPH-specificity of Sphingomonas A1-R was replaced by Glu in FlRed. Thus, we investigated cofactor-preference of FlRed using a recombinant enzyme. As a result, the recombinant FlRed (recFlRed) was found to show high specificity to NADH. recFlRed exhibited practically no activity toward variety of aldehyde, ketone, keto ester, keto acid and aldose substrates except for DEH. On the basis of these results, we conclude that FlRed is the NADH-dependent DEH-specific SDR of Flavobacterium sp. strain UMI-01.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363471>Binding of Cu(II) ions to peptides studied by fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry.</a></h1><p>Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence quenching measurements supported by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) were used to study the interactions of Cu(2+) with four peptides. Two of them were taken from the N-terminal part of the FBP28 protein (formin binding protein) WW domain: ---Ala-Asp-Gly----NH2 (D9) and its mutant ---Ala-Asn-Gly----NH2 (D9_M) as well as two mutated peptides from the B3 domain of the immunoglobulin binding protein G derived from Streptococcus: Asp-Val-Ala----NH2 (J1) and Glu-Val-Ala----NH2 (J2). The measurements were carried out at 298.15K in 20mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer solution with a pH of 6. The fluorescence of all peptides was quenched by Cu(2+) ions. The stoichiometry, conditional stability constants and thermodynamic parameters for the interactions of the Cu(2+) ions with D9 and D9_M were determined from the calorimetric data. The values of the conditional stability constants were additionally determined from fluorescence quenching measurements and compared with those obtained from calorimetric studies. There was a good correlation between data obtained from the two techniques. On the other hand, the studies revealed that J1 and J2 do not exhibit an affinity towards metal ions. The obtained results prove that fluorescence quenching experiments may be successfully used in order to determine stability constants of complexes with fluorescent ligands. Finally, based on the obtained results, the coordinating properties of the peptides towards the Cu(2+) ions are discussed.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The very N-terminal amino acid sequence largely determines whether or not a given protein is Nt-acetylated. Currently, there are six distinct NATs characterized, NatA-NatF, in humans of which the in vivo substrate specificity of Naa50 (Nat5)/NatE, an alternative catalytic subunit of the human NatA, so far remained elusive. In this study, we quantitatively compared the Nt-acetylomes of wild-type yeast S. cerevisiae expressing the endogenous yeast Naa50 (yNaa50), the congenic strain lacking yNaa50, and an otherwise identical strain expressing human Naa50 (hNaa50). Six canonical yeast NatA substrates were Nt-acetylated less in yeast lacking yNaa50 than in wild-type yeast. In contrast, the ectopically expressed hNaa50 resulted, predominantly, in the Nt-acetylation of N-terminal Met (iMet) starting N-termini, including iMet-, iMet-Val, iMet-Ala, iMet-, iMet-Phe, iMet-Leu, iMet-Ser, and iMet- N-termini. This identified hNaa50 as being similar, in its substrate specificity, to the previously characterized hNaa60/NatF. In addition, the identification, in yNaa50-lacking yeast expressing hNaa50, of Nt-acetylated iMet followed by a small residue such as Ser, , Ala, or Val, revealed a kinetic competition between Naa50 and Met-aminopeptidases (MetAPs), and implied that Nt-acetylated iMet followed by a small residue cannot be removed by MetAPs, a deduction supported by our in vitro data. As such, Naa50-mediated Nt-acetylation may act to retain the iMet of proteins of otherwise MetAP susceptible N-termini and the fraction of retained and Nt-acetylated iMet (followed by a small residue) in such a setting would be expected to depend on the relative levels of ribosome-associated Naa50/NatA and MetAPs.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The quantum chemical calculations have been performed to analyze the interactions of 130 loop, 190 helix, 220 loop region, and conserved residues 95,145,153-155, of pandemic viruses' HA with sialo-trisaccharide receptor of avian and human using density functional theory. The HA's residues  95, Ala 138, Gln 191, Arg 220, and Asp 225 from the above regions have stronger interaction with avian receptor. The residues  136, Trp 153, His 183, and Asp 190 of HA are important and play a significant role to bind with human receptor. The residues  95, Ala 138,  145, Trp 153, Gln 192, and Gln 226 of HA of CA09 virus have found more interaction energies with human than avian receptors. Due to mutations in the active residues of HA of CA09 virus comparing with SC1918, the binding capabilities of HA with human have been increased. The molecular dynamics simulation was made to understand the different dynamical properties of HA and molecular interactions between HA of these two viruses with sialo-trisaccharide receptors of avian and human receptors. The interaction energy of HA of CA09 virus with human receptor decreases due to the human receptor far away from conserved residue region of HA protein. This reveals that the conserved residues particularly  145 play major contribution to interaction with human receptor in HA of CA09 virus.</p></html>
