(figs) on antioxidant, antidiabetic, and antiobesogenic effects in vitro. Fruit, leaves, and stembark of the F. carica plant were sequentially extracted using organic and inorganic solvents and their total polyphenol and flavonoid contents were estimated. The effects of the extracts on antioxidative, antidiabetic (inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes), and antiobesogenic (antilipase) activities were measured using several experimental models. The fruit ethanolic extract contained a high quantity of polyphenols and flavonoids (104.67±5.51 μg/mL and 81.67±4.00 μg/mL) compared with all other extracts. The activity of the ethanolic extract of F. carica fruit was significantly (p<0.05) higher than all other extracts and parts of the plant in terms of antioxidative, antidiabetic, and antiobesogenic effects. The IC values of the fruit ethanolic extract in terms of antioxidative (134.44±18.43 μg/mL), and inhibition of α-glucosidase (255.57±36.46 μg/mL), α-amylase (315.89±3.83 μg/mL), and pancreatic lipase (230.475±9.65 μg/mL) activity indicate that the activity of fruit ethanolic extract is better than all other extracts of the plant. The gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis of the fruit ethanolic extract showed the presence of a number of bioactive compounds such as butyl butyrate, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, 1-butoxy-1-isobutoxy butane, malic acid, tetradecanoic acid, phytol , trans phytol, n-hexadecanoic acid, 9Z,12Z-octadecadienoic acid, stearic acid, sitosterol, 3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-2,3-dihydro-4H-pyran-4-one, and 2,4,5-trimethyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one. The results of this study suggest that the ethanolic extract of the fruit of F. carica may have potential antidiabetic and antiobesogenic agents.Copyright © 2017.

The development of type 2 diabetes mellitus is closely linked to  dysfunction of adipose tissue and adipocytes. However, the VOC profile of human adipocytes has not yet been investigated. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection and head-space needle trap extraction (two-bed Carbopack X/Carboxen 1000 needle traps) were applied to profile VOCs produced and metabolised by human Simpson Golabi Behmel  adipocytes. In total, sixteen compounds were identified to be related to the metabolism of the cells. Four sulphur compounds (carbon disulphide, dimethyl sulphide, ethyl methyl sulphide and dimethyl disulphide), three heterocyclic compounds (2-ethylfuran, 2-methyl-5-(methyl-thio)-furan, and 2-pentylfuran), two ketones (acetone and 2-pentanone), two hydrocarbons (isoprene and n-heptane) and one ester (ethyl ) were produced, and four aldehydes (2-methyl-propanal, butanal, pentanal and hexanal) were found to be consumed by the cells of interest. This study presents the first profile of VOCs formed by human adipocytes, which may reflect the activity of the adipose tissue enzymes and provide evidence of their active role in  regulation. Our data also suggest that a previously reported increase of isoprene and sulphur compounds in diabetic patients may be explained by their production by adipocytes. Moreover, the unique features of this profile, including a high emission of dimethyl sulphide and the production of furan-containing VOCs, increase our knowledge about metabolism in adipose tissue and provide diagnostic potential for future applications.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

(EFAD) on  that is induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). It was demonstrated that EFAD suppresses lipid accumulation and improves insulin resistance (IR) caused by Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in  experiments using the 3T3-L1 cell. In  tests, C57BL/6 mice were fed EFAD at 20 and 40 mg/kg body weight (BW) for four weeks after the mice were fed HFD for 15 weeks to induce obesity. EFAD significantly suppressed the elevation of BW and improved impaired glucose tolerance in obese mice. Additionally, this study showed that EFAD has an ameliorating effect on obesity-induced cognitive disorder with behavioral tests. The effect of EFAD on peripheral-IR improvement was confirmed by serum analysis and western blotting in peripheral tissues. Additionally, EFAD showed an ameliorating effect on HFD-induced oxidative stress, impaired cholinergic system and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are interrelated symptoms of neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease and central nervous system (CNS)-IR in brain tissue. Furthermore, we confirmed that EFAD improves CNS-IR by confirming the IR-related factors in brain tissue. Consequently, this study suggests the possibility of using EFAD for the prevention of neurodegeneration by improving  that is caused by HFD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25982919> in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone.</a></h2><p> (MS) has not yet been studied in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) men treated with novel hormonal therapies. The study aims to assess the impact of MS on outcome from time starting abiraterone.We retrospectively evaluated a consecutive series of metastatic CRPC patients treated with abiraterone after docetaxel failure. MS, as defined by modified Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria, was assessed at the time of initiation of abiraterone, during treatment and follow-up.Sixty-seven of 178 patients evaluated (37.6%) met MS criteria at baseline, before abiraterone initiation, whereas for 11 (9.9%) without MS before treatment with abiraterone this occurred during treatment. Median PFS was equal to 4.7 months for patients with MS versus 9 months for those without MS. Patients with MS had an increased risk of 71% of progression or death for all causes than patients without MS (HR = 1.7, 95% CI [1.2-2.4], P = 0.03). Median OS was 14.7 months and 22.3 months in patients with and without MS, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, MS resulted not significantly associated to OS (HR = 1.42, 95% CI [0.91-2.22], P = 0.073).The presence of MS is a significant risk factor for shorter PFS in CRPC patients treated with abiraterone, even if it does not show a significant impact on OS.

To overcome clopidogrel resistance, several promising clopidogrel analogues have been developed in China, such as vicagrel (and its deuterated analogues), PLD-301, and W1. These novel chemical analogues are all characterized by much faster and more efficient bioconversion to clopidogrel thiolactone (or 2-oxo-clopidogrel, the precursor of clopidogrel active metabolite) in the intestine than clopidogrel itself through bypassing the first-step P450-mediated oxidation of clopidogrel in the liver. Of them,  conversion of vicagrel and PLD-301 to 2-oxo-clopidogrel is catalyzed by intestinal carboxylesterase 2 and alkaline phosphatase, respectively. In this review article, we summarized all evidence on highly efficient bioconversion to their shared precursor of clopidogrel active metabolite and the mechanisms underlying such a pronounced improvement. These drugs in the pipeline would be promising antiplatelet drugs that could be superior to clopidogrel in future patient care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28733671>Short-chain fatty acids and inulin, but not guar gum, prevent diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance through differential mechanisms in mice.</a></h2><p>The role of dietary fibre and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in obesity development is controversially discussed. Here, we investigated how various types of dietary fibre and different SCFA ratios affect -related disorders. Male mice (B6) were fed high-fat diets supplemented with dietary fibres (either cellulose, inulin or guar gum) or different Ac:Pr ratios (high  (HAc) or propionate (HPr)) for 30 weeks. Body-fat gain and insulin resistance were greatly reduced by inulin, but not by guar gum, and completely prevented by SCFA supplementation. Only inulin and HAc increased body temperature, possibly by the induction of beige/browning markers in WAT. In addition, inulin and SCFA lowered hepatic triglycerides and improved insulin sensitivity. Both, inulin and HAc reduced hepatic fatty acid uptake, while only inulin enhanced mitochondrial capacity and only HAc suppressed lipogenesis in liver. Interestingly, HPr was accompanied by the induction of Nrg4 in BAT. Fermentable fibre supplementation increased the abundance of bifidobacteria; B. animalis was particularly stimulated by inulin and B. pseudolongum by guar gum. We conclude that in contrast to guar gum, inulin and SCFA prevent the onset of diet-induced weight gain and hepatic steatosis by different mechanisms on liver and adipose tissue metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27434092>Effects of Arabinoxylan and Resistant Starch on Intestinal Microbiota and Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Subjects with : A Randomised Crossover Study.</a></h2><p>Recently, the intestinal microbiota has been emphasised as an important contributor to the development of . Dietary fibre may exert beneficial effects through modulation of the intestinal microbiota and  end products. We investigated the effects of a diet enriched with two different dietary fibres, arabinoxylan and resistant starch type 2, on the gut microbiome and faecal short-chain fatty acids. Nineteen adults with  completed this randomised crossover study with two 4-week interventions of a diet enriched with arabinoxylan and resistant starch and a low-fibre Western-style diet. Faecal samples were collected before and at the end of the interventions for fermentative end-product analysis and 16S ribosomal RNA bacterial gene amplification for identification of bacterial taxa. Faecal carbohydrate residues were used to verify compliance. The diet enriched with arabinoxylan and resistant starch resulted in significant reductions in the total species diversity of the faecal-associated intestinal microbiota but also increased the heterogeneity of bacterial communities both between and within subjects. The proportion of Bifidobacterium was increased by arabinoxylan and resistant starch consumption (P<0.001), whereas the proportions of certain bacterial genera associated with dysbiotic intestinal communities were reduced. Furthermore, the total short-chain fatty acids (P<0.01),  (P<0.01) and butyrate concentrations (P<0.01) were higher by the end of the diet enriched with arabinoxylan and resistant starch compared with those resulting from the Western-style diet. The concentrations of isobutyrate (P = 0.05) and isovalerate (P = 0.03) decreased in response to the arabinoxylan and resistant starch enriched diet, indicating reduced protein fermentation.

In this hospitalized intervention trial with PWS (n = 17) and simple obesity (n = 21) children, a diet rich in non-digestible carbohydrates induced significant weight loss and concomitant structural changes of the gut microbiota together with reduction of serum antigen load and alleviation of inflammation. Co-abundance network analysis of 161 prevalent bacterial draft genomes assembled directly from metagenomic datasets showed relative increase of functional genome groups for  production from carbohydrates fermentation. NMR-based metabolomic profiling of urine showed diet-induced overall changes of host metabotypes and identified significantly reduced trimethylamine N-oxide and indoxyl sulfate, host-bacteria co-metabolites known to induce  deteriorations. Specific bacterial genomes that were correlated with urine levels of these detrimental co-metabolites were found to encode enzyme genes for production of their precursors by fermentation of choline or tryptophan in the gut. When transplanted into germ-free mice, the pre-intervention gut microbiota induced higher inflammation and larger adipocytes compared with the post-intervention microbiota from the same volunteer. Our multi-omics-based systems analysis indicates a significant etiological contribution of dysbiotic gut microbiota to both genetic and simple obesity in children, implicating a potentially effective target for alleviation.Poorly managed diet and genetic mutations are the two primary driving forces behind the devastating epidemic of obesity-related diseases. Lack of understanding of the molecular chain of causation between the driving forces and the disease endpoints retards progress in prevention and treatment of the diseases. We found that children genetically obese with Prader-Willi  shared a similar dysbiosis in their gut microbiota with those having diet-related obesity. A diet rich in non-digestible but fermentable carbohydrates significantly promoted beneficial groups of bacteria and reduced toxin-producers, which contributes to the alleviation of  deteriorations in obesity regardless of the primary driving forces.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28291580>Restored Plasma Anandamide and Endometrial Expression of Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase in Women With Polycystic Ovary  by the Combination Use of Diane-35 and Metformin.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary  (PCOS) is a  and endocrinal disorder affecting a number of women of reproductive age. We aimed to reveal the correlation between the endocannabinoid system and PCOS, which may provide a new therapeutic target for PCOS treatment.Serum levels of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol andexpression of cannabinoid receptors and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in the endometrium were compared between women with PCOS and infertile women without PCOS, as well as women with PCOS before and after treatment with Diane-35 and metformin. Cannabinoid receptors and FAAH in the endometrium were stained using the immunohistochemical method. Results were analyzed by calculating integrated optical density.Plasma anandamide was increased significantly in women with PCOS compared with infertile women without PCOS. Treatment with Diane-35 and metformin reversed this increase in women with PCOS. No significant difference in 2-arachidonoylglycerol was observed between the infertile women with or without PCOS. The women with PCOS had lower endometrial expression of FAAH compared with infertile women without PCOS, whereas no significant difference in endometrial expression of cannabinoid receptors was observed between the women with PCOS and infertile women without PCOS. We found that after treatment with Diane-35 and metformin, FAAH expression tended toward a significant increase compared with women before the treatment.Endocannabinoid system may be involved in the progression of PCOS, and serum anandamide could serve as a potential biomarker of clinical diagnosis of PCOS.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

However, the specific interplay between KYDS and intestinal microbiota, and the intrinsic regulation mechanism of You-gui pill (YGP) on KYDS' gut microbiota remains largely unknown so far.In the present study, fecal metabonomics combined with 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis were used to explore the mutual effect between KYDS and intestinal flora, and the intrinsic regulation mechanism of YGP on KYDS's gut microbiota. Rats' feces from control (CON) group, KYDS group and YGP group were collected, and metabolomic analysis was performed using H NMR technique combined with multivariate statistical analysis to obtain differential metabolites. Simultaneously, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis based on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform and ANOVA analysis were used to analyze the composition of the intestinal microbiota in the stool samples and to screen for the significant altered microbiota at the genus level. After that, MetaboAnalyst database and PICRUSt software were apply to conduct  pathway analysis and functional prediction analysis of the screened differential metabolites and intestinal microbiota, respectively. What's more, Pearson correlation analysis was performed on these differential metabolites and gut microbiota.Using fecal metabonomics, KYDS was found to be associated with 21 differential metabolites and seven potential  pathways. These metabolites and  pathways were mainly involved in amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, methylamine metabolism, bile acid metabolism and urea cycle, and short-chain fatty acid metabolism. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we found that KYDS was related to eleven different intestinal microbiotas. These gut microbiota were mostly involved in amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. Combined fecal metabonomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we further discovered that KYDS was primarily linked to three gut microbiotas (i.e. Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio and [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group) and eleven related metabolites (i.e. deoxycholate, n-butyrate, valine, isoleucine, , taurine, glycine, α-gluconse, β-glucose, glycerol and tryptophan) mediated various  disorders (amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, especially methylamine metabolism, bile acid metabolism and urea cycle, short-chain fatty acid metabolism. nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism). YGP, however, had the ability to mediate four kinds of microbes (i.e. Ruminiclostridium_9, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-007, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010, and uncultured_bacterium_f_Bacteroidales_S24-7_group) and ten related metabolites (i.e. deoxycholate, valine, isoleucine, alanine, citrulline, , DMA, TMA, phenylalanine and tryptophan) mediated amino acid metabolism, especially methylamine metabolism, bile acid metabolism and urea cycle, short-chain fatty acid metabolism, endocrine, immune and digestive system, and lipid metabolism, thereby exerting a therapeutic effect on KYDS rats.Overall, our findings have preliminary confirmed that KYDS is closely related to  and microbial dysbiosis, whereas YGP can improve the  disorder of KYDS by acting on intestinal microbiota.

Three candidate probiotic strains, Lactobacillus paracasei CNCM I-4270 (LC), L. rhamnosus I-3690 (LR) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis I-2494 (BA), were individually administered to HFD-fed mice (10(8) cells day(-1)) for 12 weeks. Each strain attenuated weight gain and macrophage infiltration into epididymal adipose tissue and markedly improved glucose-insulin homeostasis and hepatic steatosis. Weighted UniFrac principal coordinate analysis based on 454 pyrosequencing of fecal bacterial 16S rRNA genes showed that the probiotic strains shifted the overall structure of the HFD-disrupted gut microbiota toward that of lean mice fed a normal (chow) diet. Redundancy analysis revealed that abundances of 83 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were altered by probiotics. Forty-nine altered OTUs were significantly correlated with one or more host MS parameters and were designated 'functionally relevant phylotypes'. Thirteen of the 15 functionally relevant OTUs that were negatively correlated with MS phenotypes were promoted, and 26 of the 34 functionally relevant OTUs that were positively correlated with MS were reduced by at least one of the probiotics, but each strain changed a distinct set of functionally relevant OTUs. LC and LR increased cecal  but did not affect circulating lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; in contrast, BA did not increase  but significantly decreased adipose and hepatic tumor necrosis factor-α gene expression.

It is usually associated with an imbalance between pro-oxidant mechanisms and antioxidant defenses, contributing to oxidative-stress, and this leads to an increased susceptibility to endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, insulin-resistance and impaired-pancreatic β-cell function.We have assessed the Prooxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB) and anti-hemolytic effect of Thuja orientalis L using the PAB assay and the analysis of hematological markers.The antioxidant and anti-hemolytic activity of Thuja orientalis was evaluated using the PAB assay and the inhibition of RBC hemolysis using the hydrogen peroxide hemolysis test. The percentage of anti-hemolysis was calculated from the ratio of the measurements (A-B)/B×100.Our results showed that the antioxidant effect of Thuja orientalis L. was greater in water than in ethyl-, ethanol and methanol extract, respectively. We also observed its anti-hemolytic effect, which was higher in water, than in ethyl-, methanol and ethanol extract, respectively. In particular our data showed that the H2O2-induced RBC hemolysis was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner.we demonstrated the antioxidant and anti-hemolytic effect of Thuja orientalis L. extracts in human serum and RBC, showing its potential property of reducing free radicals supporting further investigations to assess its functional role in larger samples size and in vivo models, as a potential antioxidant agent.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30430749>A Two-Step Multicomponent Synthetic Approach and Anti-inflammatory Evaluation of N-Substituted 2-Oxopyrazines.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is widely reported as a main factor for the development of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and even . Thus, the search for novel anti-inflammatory compounds is required. Herein we describe the synthesis of a collection of peptidic pyrazinones by a convenient approach involving a multicomponent isocyanide-based reaction followed by a tandem deprotection/oxidative cyclization step. This series of compounds were tested for their potential anti-inflammatory capacity in an in vivo murine model, and four compounds were identified to inhibit tetradecanoylphorbol  (TPA)-induced edema by more than 75 %. The two most active compounds, N-benzyl-2-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-[2-oxopyrazin-1(2H)-yl]acetamide (10 o) and N-cyclohexyl-2-[2-oxopyrazin-1(2H)-yl]-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]acetamide (10 x), with methyl and trifluoromethyl groups, were also able to decrease myeloperoxidase activity and leukocyte infiltration.

Monocytes/macrophages are critical in the development of , including gout, obesity and atherosclerosis. However, how high uric acid (HUA) exposure affects monocyte/macrophage function remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of HUA exposure in monocytes/macrophages and its impact on oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced foam-cell formation in a human monocytic cell line, THP-1.We primed THP-1 cells with phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA) for differentiation, then exposed cells to HUA and detected the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and analyzed the level of phospho-AMPKα. THP-1 cells were pre-incubated with Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, or N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, or HUA before PMA, to assess CD68 expression and phospho-AMPKα level. PMA-primed THP-1 cells were pre-treated with oxLDL before Compound C and HUA treatment. Western blot analysis was used to examine the levels of phospho-AMPKα, CD68, ABCG1, ABCA1, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and NF-κB (p65). Flow cytometry was used to assess ROS production and CD68 expression in live cells. Oil-red O staining was used to observe oxLDL uptake in cells.HUA treatment increased ROS production in PMA-primed THP-1 cells; NAC blocked HUA-induced oxidative stress. HUA treatment time-dependently increased phospho-AMPKα level in PMA-primed THP-1 cells. The HUA-induced oxidative stress increased phospho-AMPKα levels, which was blocked by NAC. HUA treatment impaired CD68 expression during cell differentiation by activating the AMPK pathway, which was reversed by Compound C treatment. Finally, HUA treatment inhibited oxLDL uptake in the formation of foam cells in THP-1 cells, which was blocked by Compound C treatment. HUA treatment significantly increased the expression of ABCG1 and reversed the oxLDL-reduced ABCG1 expression but did not affect the expression of ABCA1, NF-κB (p65) or COX-2.HUA exposure activated the ROS-AMPK pathway, impaired CD68 expression, and inhibited oxLDL-induced foam-cell formation in a human monocytic cell line, THP-1.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

Metabolomics is an emerging field that holds promise in understanding disease pathophysiology. Recently, a few metabolomics based studies have been attempted in PCOS patients; however, none of them have included patients from the Indian population. The main objective of this study was to investigate the serum metabolomic profile of Indian women with PCOS and compare them with controls. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR) was used to first identify the differentially expressed metabolites among women with PCOS from the Eastern region of India during the discovery phase and further validated in a separate cohort of PCOS and control subjects. Multivariate analysis of the binned spectra indicated 16 dysregulated bins in the sera of these women with PCOS. Out of these 16 bins, 13 identified bins corresponded to 12 metabolites including 8 amino acids and 4 energy metabolites. Amongst the amino acids, alanine, valine, leucine and threonine and amongst the energy metabolites, lactate and  were observed to be significantly up-regulated in women with PCOS when compared with controls. The remaining 4 amino acids, l-glutamine, proline, glutamate and histidine were down-regulated along with 2 energy metabolites: glucose and 3-hydroxybutyric acid. Our findings showed dysregulations in the expression of different metabolites in the serum of women with PCOS suggesting the involvement of multiple pathways including amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate/lipid metabolism, purine and pyrimidine metabolism and protein synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25533197>Ketone body production is differentially altered in steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in obese humans.</a></h2><p>Levels of ketone bodies have been reported to be both increased and decreased in individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We investigated whether the metabolism of ketone bodies is different in simple steatosis and in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Serum low molecular weight molecules including ketone bodies were measured using high-throughput proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance in 116 (76 categorized unequivocally to those with normal liver, simple steatosis or NASH) morbidly obese individuals [age 47.3 ± 8.7 (mean ± SD) years, body mass index 45.1 ± 6.1 kg/m(2) , 39 men and 77 women] with histological assessment of NASH and analysis of gene expression in the liver. Finally, we correlated β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) levels with NASH predicting score in  in Men Study (METSIM) population study (n = 8749 non-diabetic men).Levels of ketone bodies were lower in individuals with NASH compared to individuals with simple steatosis (P = 0.004 and P = 0.018 for β-OHB and acetoacetate respectively). Lower levels of β-OHB were associated with the NASH predicting score in the METSIM study (P = 0.001). Liver inflammation correlated with mRNA expression of genes regulating ketolysis in the liver (Spearman correlation 0.379-0.388, P < 0.0006 for ACAT1, ACSS2 and BDH1).Lower levels of ketone bodies in individuals with NASH compared to individuals with simple steatosis suggest a decrease in ketone body metabolism in NASH.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In this meta-analysis the effects of the different durations (from 3months to 1year) of OC treatment using cyproterone  (CA) or third generation progestins on  profile of patients with PCOS were assessed.PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect databases (2001-2015) were searched to identify clinical trials investigating the effects of OC containing CA or third generation progestins on  profiles of women with PCOS. Both fixed and random effect models were used. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the progestin compounds used and on duration of treatment.Oral contraceptive (OC) use was found to be associated with a worsening in lipid profiles but no changes were observed in other  outcomes, including body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin, homeostatic model for measuring insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and in blood pressure (BP) values. All studied OCs showed similar effects on lipid profiles but with different timings, with products containing CA, requiring 6months to raise high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and 12months to increase triglycerides (TG). On the contrary, products containing drospirenone (DRSP) or desogestrel (DSG) increased HDL-C after only 3months but determined elevations of TG after 6months. All OCs induced an increase in low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) after 12months of use.The study shows that, in women with PCOS, OC use is associated with significant changes in lipid profiles, including elevation not only in HDL-C but also in TG and LDL-C. All OCs studied showed similar effects but with different timings, with products containing CA generally requiring more prolonged use to increase serum lipids. Instead, OC use does not affect body weight, BP or glucose levels, with only some minor increase of fasting insulin levels.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The ethanol extract (SE) was then partitioned sequentially with hexane, ethyl  and methanol, and these extracts were named SE-Hex, SE-EA and SE-MeOH, respectively. The experimental results showed that SE-EA had the highest total phenolic content (TPC, 76.9 ± 1.8 mg/g) and the total flavonoids content (TFC, 5.3 ± 0.3 mg/g). This extract exhibited the most significant antioxidant activities, including DPPH radical-scavenging capacity (IC = 161.8 ± 2.4 μg/mL), ABTS radical-scavenging capacity (IC = 13.9 ± 1.5 μg/mL) and reducing power. For anti-glycation activities, SE-EA showed the best results in the inhibition of AGEs, as well as inhibitory activities against α-glucosidase (IC = 362.3 ± 9.2 μg/mL) and α-amylase (IC = 119.0 ± 17.7 μg/mL). For anti-obesity activities, SE-EA indicated the highest suppression effect on pancreatic lipase (IC = 3.67 ± 0.52 mg/mL). Finally, for anti-hypertension activity, SE-EA also demonstrated the strongest inhibitory activity on ACE (IC = 626.6 ± 15.0 μg/mL). Close relationships were observed among the parameters of TPC, antioxidant activities, inhibitory activities on α-amylase, α-glucosidase, lipase and ACE (R > 0.9). Moderate correlations were found among the parameters of TFC, antioxidant activities, and suppression of dicarbonyl compounds formation (R = 0.5-0.9).

Specifically, disruption of homeostatic redox balance in accumulated body fat mass leads to obesity-associated . Strategies for the restoration of redox balance, potentially by exploring potent plant bioactives, have thus become the focus of therapeutic intervention. The present study aimed to bioprospect the potential use of the curculigoside-cinnamic acid-rich fraction from Molineria latifolia rhizome as an antioxidant therapeutic agent. The ethyl  fraction (EAF) isolated from M. latifolia rhizome methanolic extract (RME) contained the highest amount of phenolic compounds, particularly curculigoside and cinnamic acid. EAF demonstrated glycation inhibitory activities in both glucose- and fructose-mediated glycation models. In addition, in vitro chemical-based and cellular-based antioxidant assays showed that EAF exhibited high antioxidant activities and a protective effect against oxidative damage in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Although the efficacies of individual phenolics differed depending on the structure and concentration, a correlational study revealed strong correlations between total phenolic contents and antioxidant capacities. The results concluded that enriched phenolic contents in EAF (curculigoside-cinnamic acid-rich fraction) contributed to the overall better reactivity.

Thus, the development of novel drugs is urgently needed to control obesity related diseases.Here, we investigated the protective role of Lavatera critica (LC), a green vegetable, in male C57BL/6J mice fed with high fat (HF) diet for 10 weeks to induce hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative cellular damage.After oral administration of chloroform (CFLC), ethyl  (EFLC), or methanol (MFLC) fractions of Lavatera critica to the HF group, EALC alone significantly reduced the activities of hepatic markers such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST); moreover, the results showed that 50 mg/kg dose has the maximum activity. Thus, this active dose of EFLC was used for further analysis. Moreover, EFLC reduced the level of hepatic triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), free fatty acids (FFA), and prevented further increase in the body weight. Intriguingly, EFLC treatment also reversed the mRNA expression of fatty acid oxidative genes, such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACO), and fatty acid synthesis genes such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Furthermore, EFLC treatment also decreased the production of oxidative stress biomarkers, such as conjugated diene (CD), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH), and significantly enhanced the level of enzymatic antioxidants, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), as well as non-enzymatic antioxidants, such as reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamin C, and vitamin E in the liver.Taken together, we conclude that EFLC has a protective effect against HF diet induced hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative cellular damage through the regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis genes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Traditionally, it has been suggested that reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels might be an important morbidity indicator for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it has been argued that therapeutically raising HDL levels may reduce atherogenesis in patients with dyslipidemia.

Thus, to investigate the functionality of HDL and to explore the possible clinical relevance as well as to define an effective indicator that can represent HDL function may provide another key and reference to disclose the clinical treatment of dyslipidemia. We analyzed the association between the data of dichlorofluorescein assay (assay the functionality of HDL), the effect of HDL on oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-stimulated endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in vitro, levels of circulating EPCs, and ex vitro EPC colony forming units of each case, we defined the indicator (relative HDL index (RHDL index) = dichlorofluorescein assay result of each subject/dichlorofluorescein assay reading of our young healthy controls) that may represent functionality of HDL. HDL from healthy adults protected oxLDL-treated EPCs by modulating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Rho activation and by promoting nitric oxide production.

Part II: Treatment of Relapsing, Metastatic, and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.</a></h2><p>To present a summary of the 2016 version of the European Association of Urology (EAU) - European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology (ESTRO) - International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) Guidelines on the treatment of relapsing, metastatic, and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).The working panel performed a literature review of the new data (2013-2015). The guidelines were updated, and the levels of evidence and/or grades of recommendation were added based on a systematic review of the literature.Relapse after local therapy is defined by a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level >0.2ng/ml following radical prostatectomy (RP) and >2ng/ml above the nadir after radiation therapy (RT). C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography is of limited importance if PSA is <1.0ng/ml; bone scans and computed tomography can be omitted unless PSA is >10ng/ml. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy are important to assess biochemical failure following RT. Therapy for PSA relapse after RP includes salvage RT at PSA levels <0.5ng/ml and salvage RP, high-intensity focused ultrasound, cryosurgical ablation or salvage brachytherapy of the prostate in radiation failures. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the basis for treatment of men with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). However, docetaxel combined with ADT should be considered the standard of care for men with metastases at first presentation, provided they are fit enough to receive the drug. Follow-up of ADT should include analysis of PSA, testosterone levels, and screening for cardiovascular disease and . Level 1 evidence for the treatment of metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) includes, abiraterone  plus prednisone (AA/P), enzalutamide, radium 223 (Ra 223), docetaxel at 75 mg/m every 3 wk and sipuleucel-T. Cabazitaxel, AA/P, enzalutamide, and radium are approved for second-line treatment of CRPC following docetaxel. Zoledronic acid and denosumab can be used in men with mCRPC and osseous metastases to prevent skeletal-related complications.The knowledge in the field of advanced and metastatic PCa and CRPC is changing rapidly. The 2016 EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and advice for use in clinical practice. These PCa guidelines are the first endorsed by the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology and the International Society of Geriatric Oncology and reflect the multidisciplinary nature of PCa management. A full version is available from the EAU office or online (http://uroweb.org/guideline/prostate-cancer/).In men with a rise in their PSA levels after prior local treatment for prostate cancer only, it is important to balance overtreatment against further progression of the disease since survival and quality of life may never be affected in many of these patients. For patients diagnosed with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, several new drugs have become available which may provide a clear survival benefit but the optimal choice will have to be made on an individual basis.Copyright © 2016 European Association of Urology.

This study aimed to compare the different effects of drospirenone (DRP)-containing COCs with cyproterone  (CPA)-containing COCs, combined with metformin and lifestyle modifications in women with PCOS and  disorders.Ninety-nine women with PCOS and a  disorder between January 2011 and January 2013 were enrolled into this prospective randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomized into two groups such as DRP-containing COCs, and CPA-containing COCs. Participants took COCs cyclically for 6 months, combined with metformin administration (1.5 g/d) and lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise). Clinical measures and biochemical and hormone profiles were compared. Comparisons for continuous variables were evaluated with paired and unpaired Student's t-tests. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used when the data were not normally distributed. Analysis of covariance was used to control for age, body mass index (BMI), and baseline data of each analyzed parameter when compared between the two groups.A total of 68 patients have completed the study. The combination regimen of COCs, metformin, and lifestyle modifications in these patients resulted in a significant decrease in BMI, acne, and hirsutism scores when compared to baseline levels in both groups (P < 0.05). Blood pressure (BP) was significantly different in the CPA group when compared to baseline (75.14 ± 6.77 mmHg vs. 80.70 ± 5.60 mmHg, P < 0.01), and after 6 months of treatment, only the change in systolic BP was significantly different between the two groups (4.00 [-6.00, 13.00] mmHg vs. -3.50 [-13.00, 9.00] mmHg, P = 0.009). Fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance decreased significantly in the DRP group (5.40 ± 0.41 mmol/L vs. 5.21 ± 0.32 mmol/L, P = 0.041; 13.90 [10.50, 18.40] μU/ml vs. 10.75 [8.60, 13.50] μU/ml, P = 0.020; 3.74 [2.85, 4.23] vs. 2.55 [1.92, 3.40], P = 0.008) but did not differ between the two groups. While individual lipid profiles increased in both groups, no statistically significant difference was observed.DRP-containing COCs combined with metformin and lifestyle modifications could better control BP and correct carbohydrate metabolism in women with PCOS and  disorders compared with CPA-containing COCs.Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR-TRC-11001143; http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=8395.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27701140>Leaves of Cordia boissieri A.

A recent investigation showed the significant protective effect of ethyl  extract against  (MS). However, the corresponding active principles responsible for this effect and relations between their structure and biological actions remain unclear. Thus, ethyl  extract was subjected to column chromatography, which yielded seven compounds identified on the basis of spectroscopic data as rutin, hesperidin, kaempferol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, rosmarinic acid, β-sitosterol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin, and kaempferol. The isolated compounds (5 mg/kg/day) were tested in a fructose enriched-diet rat model using metformin as a standard drug. Blood samples were withdrawn for estimation of MS-associated biomarkers and liver samples were subjected to histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. The isolated compounds impaired most of the changes associated with MS as evidenced by improved insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, kidney function, lipid profiles and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation by different degrees. It is worth noting that quercetin and kaempferol showed the most potent effect.

This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AES) aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of current best practices in 2015. PCOS has been defined using various criteria, including menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM). General agreement exists among specialty society guidelines that the diagnosis of PCOS must be based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism (clinical or biological) and polycystic ovaries. There is need for careful clinical assessment of women's history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation, emphasizing the accuracy and validity of the methodology used for both biochemical measurements and ovarian imaging. Free testosterone (T) levels are more sensitive than the measurement of total T for establishing the existence of androgen excess and should be ideally determined through equilibrium dialysis techniques. Value of measuring levels of androgens other than T in patients with PCOS is relatively low. New ultrasound machines allow diagnosis of PCOM in patients having at least 25 small follicles (2 to 9 mm) in the whole ovary. Ovarian size at 10 mL remains the threshold between normal and increased ovary size. Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone and anti-Müllerian hormone are useful for determining a diagnosis of PCOS. Correct diagnosis of PCOS impacts on the likelihood of associated  and cardiovascular risks and leads to appropriate intervention, depending upon the woman's age, reproductive status, and her own concerns. The management of women with PCOS should include reproductive function, as well as the care of hirsutism, alopecia, and acne. Cycle length >35 days suggests chronic anovulation, but cycle length slightly longer than normal (32 to 35 days) or slightly irregular (32 to 35-36 days) needs assessment for ovulatory dysfunction. Ovulatory dysfunction is associated with increased prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer, in addition to infertility. In PCOS, hirsutism develops gradually and intensifies with weight gain. In the neoplastic virilizing states, hirsutism is of rapid onset, usually associated with clitoromegaly and oligomenorrhea. Girls with severe acne or acne resistant to oral and topical agents, including isotretinoin (Accutane), may have a 40% likelihood of developing PCOS. Hair loss patterns are variable in women with hyperandrogenemia, typically the vertex, crown or diffuse pattern, whereas women with more severe hyperandrogenemia may see bitemporal hair loss and loss of the frontal hairline. Oral contraceptives (OCPs) can effectively lower androgens and block the effect of androgens via suppression of ovarian androgen production and by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin. Physiologic doses of dexamethasone or prednisone can directly lower adrenal androgen output. Anti-androgens can be used to block the effects of androgen in the pilosebaceous unit or in the hair follicle. Anti-androgen therapy works through competitive antagonism of the androgen receptor (spironolactone, cyproterone , flutamide) or inhibition of 5α-reductase (finasteride) to prevent the conversion of T to its more potent form, 5α-dihydrotestosterone. The choice of antiandrogen therapy is guided by symptoms. The diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents is particularly challenging given significant age and developmental issues in this group. Management of infertility in women with PCOS requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of anovulation as well as currently available treatments. Many features of PCOS, including acne, menstrual irregularities, and hyperinsulinemia, are common in normal puberty. Menstrual irregularities with anovulatory cycles and varied cycle length are common due to the immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in the 2- to 3-year time period post-menarche. Persistent oligomenorrhea 2 to 3 years beyond menarche predicts ongoing menstrual irregularities and greater likelihood of underlying ovarian or adrenal dysfunction. In adolescent girls, large, multicystic ovaries are a common finding, so ultrasound is not a first-line investigation in women <17 years of age. Ovarian dysfunction in adolescents should be based on oligomenorrhea and/or biochemical evidence of oligo/anovulation, but there are major limitations to the sensitivity of T assays in ranges applicable to young girls. Metformin is commonly used in young girls and adolescents with PCOS as first-line monotherapy or in combination with OCPs and anti-androgen medications. In lean adolescent girls, a dose as low as 850 mg daily may be effective at reducing PCOS symptoms; in overweight and obese adolescents, dose escalation to 1.5 to 2.5 g daily is likely required. Anti-androgen therapy in adolescents could affect bone mass, although available short-term data suggest no effect on bone loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30871060>Glycyrrhetinic Acid Improves Insulin-Response Pathway by Regulating the Balance between the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/Akt Pathways.</a></h2><p>Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), a bioactive component in the human diet, has been reported to improve hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and obesity in rats with . However, GA-specific target proteins and the mechanisms involved in the downstream signaling and cross-talk to improve insulin sensitivity have not been fully elucidated. In this study, the potential targets of GA were identified by chemical proteomics strategies using serial GA probes for target fishing and cell molecular imaging. Intracellular enzyme activity evaluation and insulin resistance models were used for validating the function of the target proteins on the downstream insulin signaling pathways. Collectively, our data demonstrate that GA improved the insulin-responsive pathway and glucose consumption levels via multiple diabetogenic factors that activated the insulin signaling pathway in HepG2 cells. GA improved Glucose transporter 4(GLUT4) expression by targeting the Ras protein to regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. GA exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on IRS1ser307 phosphorylation in cells treated with the Protein kinase C (PKC) activator Phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA.) Consistently, IRS1ser307 phosphorylation was also inhibited by GA in Free fatty acid (FFA)-treated HepG2 cells. GA also inhibited the PMA-induced phosphorylation of IκB kinase α/β (IKKα/β), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 proteins (P38), suggesting that IKKα/β, JNK and P38 activation is dependent on PKC activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28252037>A proliferative probiotic Bifidobacterium strain in the gut ameliorates progression of  disorders via microbiota modulation and  elevation.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota is an important contributor to the worldwide prevalence of  (MS), which includes obesity and diabetes. The anti-MS effects exerted by Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis GCL2505 (BlaG), a highly proliferative Bifidobacterium strain in the gut, and B. longum ssp. longum JCM1217 (BloJ) were comparatively examined. BlaG treatment reduced visceral fat accumulation and improved glucose tolerance, whereas BloJ had no effect on these parameters. Gut microbial analysis revealed that BlaG exerted stronger effects on the overall bacterial structure of the gut microbiota than BloJ, including enrichment of the genus Bifidobacterium. The levels of  and glucagon-like peptide-1 were increased by BlaG treatment in both the gut and plasma, but not by BloJ treatment. Correlation analysis suggested that the elevation of gut  levels by BlaG treatment plays a pivotal role in the BlaG-induced anti-MS effects. These findings indicated that BlaG, a highly viable and proliferative probiotic, improves  disorders by modulating gut microbiota, which results in the elevation of SCFAs, especially .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28918936>Intermittent Fasting Promotes White Adipose Browning and Decreases Obesity by Shaping the Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>While activation of beige thermogenesis is a promising approach for treatment of obesity-associated diseases, there are currently no known pharmacological means of inducing beiging in humans. Intermittent fasting is an effective and natural strategy for weight control, but the mechanism for its efficacy is poorly understood. Here, we show that an every-other-day fasting (EODF) regimen selectively stimulates beige fat development within white adipose tissue and dramatically ameliorates obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. EODF treatment results in a shift in the gut microbiota composition leading to elevation of the fermentation products  and lactate and to the selective upregulation of monocarboxylate transporter 1 expression in beige cells. Microbiota-depleted mice are resistance to EODF-induced beiging, while transplantation of the microbiota from EODF-treated mice to microbiota-depleted mice activates beiging and improves  homeostasis. These findings provide a new gut-microbiota-driven mechanism for activating adipose tissue browning and treating  diseases.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29843993>A case control study on HDL associated PON1 enzyme level in Northern Indian type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the serum paraoxonase 1 activity and determine its association with duration in type 2 Diabetes mellitus patients.A total of 80 cases from type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy controls were enrolled in the present case control study.

They are used in preparation of herbal decoction and teas, which have been used traditionally to reduce body weight and for its effect on .To investigate the anti adipogenic efficacy of major fraction from ethyl  extract of the Hibiscus rosa sinensis flower at 25 and 50 µg/mL (HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL) in 3T3-L1 cells and delineate its possible mechanism of action.Pre adipocyte 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated in the presence and absence of HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL, their lipid accumulation was measured qualitatively by Oil red O staining and quantitatively by triglyceride estimation. Effect on adipolysis was determined, adipogenic and its regulatory gene and protein expression were studied and effect of HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL on AMPK was confirmed in the presence of dorsomorphin.Treatment with HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and was found to alleviate triglyceride accumulation significantly (p < 0.001) by 1.6 and 2.3 times respectively in pre adipocytes during differentiation. HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL also nonsignificantly reduced lipolysis which releases free fatty acids, a major contributing factor for insulin resistance. Activation of AMPK by phosphorylation has led to reduced gene and protein expression of adipogenic factors Peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), CCAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), Sterol regulatory element- binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and their targets Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), Fatty acid synthase (FAS), Perilipin and enhanced Adiponectin expression. Treatment with HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL also resulted in inactivation of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) by enhancing ACC phosphorylation, which reduced the levels of malonyl-CoA an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). Enhanced CPT1 levels causes induction of fatty acid β- oxidation. Effects of HRF were nullified in the presence of AMPK antagonist dorsomorphin.In summary, HRF treatments reduced adipogenesis, enhanced factors regulating fatty acid oxidation and this is mediated by AMPK activation. The results conclusively showed anti-obesity potential of HRF and it might be helpful in treatment of associated complications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We compared  changes before and after an OC commonly used in the United States between women with and without PCOS.Ten PCOS and 20 control women took ethinyl estradiol 35 μg and norgestimate 0.18/0.215/0.25 mg. Fasting glucose and insulin, area-under-the-curve (AUC) glucose and insulin, insulin sensitivity (homeostatic model assessment of insulin sensitivity index [HOMA-ISI] and Matsuda index), insulinogenic index (Δinsulin0-30 minutes/Δglucose0-30 minutes), blood pressure, and lipids were evaluated at baseline and after three cycles of OC.At baseline, PCOS women had lower insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index p = 0.0093, HOMA-ISI p = 0.0397), higher fasting insulin (p = 0.0495), fasting glucose (p = 0.0393), AUC insulin (p = 0.0023), and triglycerides (p = 0.0044) versus controls. Baseline AUC glucose did not differ between PCOS women and controls. After 3 months of OC use, glucose tolerance worsened in PCOS women versus controls (p = 0.0468). Higher baseline androgens were predictive of worsened glucose tolerance, and a reduction of AUC insulin during OC use. The insulinogenic index significantly decreased in PCOS women (p < 0.01), while fasting insulin and insulin resistance significantly worsened in control women.Women with PCOS exhibited worsened glucose tolerance (demonstrated by AUC glucose) after 3 months of a commonly used OC compared with control women.

One of the features of cachexia is the loss of muscle mass, characterized by an imbalance between protein synthesis and protein degradation. Muscle atrophy is caused by the hyperactivation of some of the main cellular catabolic pathways, including autophagy. Cachexia also affects the cardiac muscle. As a consequence of the atrophy of the heart, cardiac function is impaired and mortality is increased. Anti-cachectic therapy in patients with cancer cachexia is so far limited to nutritional support and anabolic steroids. The use of the appetite stimulant megestrol  (MA) has been discussed as a treatment for cachexia.In this study the effects of MA were tested in cachectic tumour-bearing rats (Yoshida AH-130 ascites hepatoma). Rats were treated daily with 100 mg/kg of MA or placebo starting one day after tumour inoculation, and for a period of 16 days. Body weight and body composition were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. Cardiac function was analysed by echocardiography at baseline and at day 11. Locomotor activity and food intake were assessed before tumour inoculation and at day 11. Autophagic markers were assessed in gastrocnemius muscle and heart by western blot analysis.Treatment with 100 mg/kg/day MA significantly attenuated the loss of body weight (-9 ± 12%,  < 0.05) and the wasting of lean and fat mass (-7.0 ± 6% and -22.4 ± 3 %,  < 0.001 and  < 0.05, respectively). Administration of 100 mg/kg/day MA significantly protected the heart from general atrophy (633.8 ± 30 mg vs. placebo 474 ± 13 mg,  < 0.001). Tumour-bearing rats displayed cardiac dysfunction, as indicated by the significant impairment of the left ventricular ejection fraction, the left ventricular fractional shortening, the stroke volume, the end dyastolic volume, and the end systolic volume. In contrast, MA significantly improved left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular fractional shortening, and left ventricular end systolic volume. Western blotting analysis showed an upregulation of the autophagic pathway in the gastrocnemius and hearts of the placebo-treated tumour-bearing rats. Treatment with MA, however, was able to modulate the autophagic markers (e.g. Beclin-1, p62, TRAF6, and LC3) in the gastrocnemius and in the hearts of tumour-bearing rats. Most importantly, 100 mg/kg/day MA reduced mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 0.44; 95%CI: 0.20-1.00;  = 0.0486].Megestrol  improved survival and reduced wasting through a marked downregulation of autophagy, occurring in both skeletal and heart muscle, the latter effect leading to a significant improvement of cardiac function. Our data suggest that MA might represent a valuable strategy to counteract the development of cancer cachexia-induced cardiomyopathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26584015>Trenbolone Improves Cardiometabolic Risk Factors and Myocardial Tolerance to Ischemia-Reperfusion in Male Rats With Testosterone-Deficient .</a></h2><p>The increasing prevalence of obesity adds another dimension to the pathophysiology of testosterone (TEST) deficiency (TD) and potentially impairs the therapeutic efficacy of classical TEST replacement therapy.

Male Wistar rats (n=50) were fed either a control standard rat chow (CTRL) or a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet. After 8 weeks of feeding, rats underwent sham surgery or an orchiectomy (ORX). Alzet miniosmotic pumps containing either vehicle, 2-mg/kg·d TEST or 2-mg/kg·d TREN were implanted in HF/HS+ORX rats. Body composition, fat distribution, lipid profile, and insulin sensitivity were assessed. Infarct size was quantified to assess myocardial damage after in vivo ischaemia reperfusion, before cardiac and prostate histology was performed. The HF/HS+ORX animals had increased sc and visceral adiposity; circulating triglycerides, cholesterol, and insulin; and myocardial damage, with low circulating TEST compared with CTRLs. Both TEST and TREN protected HF/HS+ORX animals against sc fat accumulation, hypercholesterolaemia, and myocardial damage. However, only TREN protected against visceral fat accumulation, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hyperinsulinaemia and reduced myocardial damage relative to CTRLs. TEST caused widespread cardiac fibrosis and prostate hyperplasia, which were less pronounced with TREN. We propose that TEST replacement therapy may have contraindications for males with TD and obesity-related MetS. TREN treatment may be more effective in restoring androgen status and reducing cardiovascular risk in males with TD and MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28703650>AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGISTS AND AMERICAN COLLEGE OF ENDOCRINOLOGY POSITION STATEMENT ON MENOPAUSE-2017 UPDATE.</a></h2><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Position Statement is designed to update the previous menopause clinical practice guidelines published in 2011 but does not replace them.

Vicagrel and clopidogrel are prodrugs requiring  activation to produce a pharmacologically active thiol metabolite (H4) in vivo. The formation of H4 from vicagrel in humans is promising more efficient and consistent than that from clopidogrel. After oral dosing of vicagrel or clopidogrel to humans, the active thiol metabolite H4 and two inactive metabolites closely related to H4 formation (the thiol metabolite H3 and the S-methylated metabolite SM3) were observed in plasma; SM3 was the most abundant drug-related component of vicagrel in circulation. In this study, a sensitive, rapid, and reliable UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the simultaneous determination of derivatized H3 (MP-H3), derivatized H4 (MP-H4), and SM3 in human plasma to investigate the pharmacokinetics of vicagrel in healthy subjects compared with clopidogrel. After extracted from 50μL of plasma by simple protein precipitation, the analytes and stable isotope-labeled internal standards were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH C column (100mm×2.1mm, 1.7μm). The mobile phase was acetonitrile-water-formic acid (45:55:0.0275, v/v/v) delivered at a flow rate of 0.45mL/min under isocratic elution. The total chromatographic run time was 6min. MP-H3, MP-H4, and SM3 were separated from their corresponding isomers under the chromatographic conditions. Mass spectrometric detection was conducted in multiple reaction monitoring mode on an AB Sciex Qtrap 5500 System using a positive electrospray ionization interface. The calibration curves were linear in the following ranges: 0.100-200ng/mL for MP-H3 and MP-H4 and 1.00-1000ng/mL for SM3. The intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision for each analyte at all concentrations were within acceptable limits (±15%). The validated method was successfully applied to compare the pharmacokinetics of vicagrel and clopidogrel after a single oral administration to healthy subjects in the first-in-human study of vicagrel.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of elevated glucocorticoid levels on the development of MetS in middle-aged female rhesus monkeys (Macaca Mulatta) after ovariectomy. Six female ovariectomized rhesus monkeys (9-13years) were randomly assigned to either a control group (normal diet, n=3) or a group in which MetS was facilitated (n=3). The MetS group fed with HFD (15% fat) and received oral prednisone  treatment (50mg/day). After 24months, the GCs treatment was withdrawn with continuation of high-fat feeding for a further 12months. After 24months, the MetS group displayed a significant increase in body weight and abdominal circumference. Additionally, the MetS animals displayed abnormal serum lipids, insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. Histology of liver biopsies indicated marked accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes of MetS animals. Withdrawal of GCs treatment led to recovery from above-mentioned  disorders. Whereas GCs treatment increased leptin expression, it lowered expression of adiponectin and other factors in adipose tissue. Expression of Hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase-1 and glucose transporter type-4 in the livers of MetS animals were reduced. We conclude that in the context of high fat diet, high levels of exogenous GCs contribute to the development of MetS in non-human primates.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we report the potential of 7, 8-diacetoxy-4-methylthiocoumarin (DAMTC) to mitigate RIII following total-body irradiation (TBI) in C57BL/6 mice and underlying mechanisms. Administration of DAMTC 24 hours post TBI facilitated structural reconstitution and restoration of functional absorption linked to alleviation of radiation-induced apoptotic death of intestinal crypt progenitor/stem (ICPS) and villus stromal cells through induction of Bcl-2 family-mediated anti-apoptotic signalling. Reduction in TBI-induced DNA damage accumulation coupled with inhibition of cell cycle arrest through stimulation of anti-p53- and anti-p21-dependent synergistic signalling protected ICPS cells from radiation injury. Enhanced proliferation of crypt stem cells, induction of anti-oxidant defence, subjugation of TBI-induced lipid peroxidation and phenotypic polarization of intestinal macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 class underlie amelioration of RIII. Stimulation of multiple mitigative signalling processes by DAMTC appeared to be associated with enhanced protein acetylation, an important regulator of cellular responses to radiation damage. Our findings establish the mitigative potential of DAMTC against RIII by hyper-acetylation-mediated epigenetic regulation, which triggers axes of anti-apoptotic and pro-survival pathways, enabling proliferation and maintenance of ICPS cells leading to epithelial regeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25986733>Longitudinal assessment of immuno- parameters in multiple sclerosis patients during treatment with glatiramer .</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of glatiramer  (GA) on the modulation of immune cell subpopulations and serum levels of multiple immune/ markers in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to understand whether the treatment with GA could induce a specific change in the immunometabolic asset of patients with RRMS.We performed an extensive peripheral blood immunophenotyping and measured serum levels of several parameters involved in the pathogenesis of RRMS and also relevant in the pathogenesis of  and obesity such as leptin, soluble leptin-receptor (sLep-R), myeloperoxidase (MPO), soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40-L), soluble tumor necrosis factor-receptor (sTNF-R), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), soluble Inter-Cellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), in 20 naïve-to-treatment RRMS patients and 20 healthy controls. We repeated these analyses over time at 6 and 12 months after starting GA treatment.Our analysis showed that naïve-to-treatment RRMS patients had a lower number of CD16(+)CD56(+) NK cells, CD19(+) B cells, CD4(+) T cells co-expressing the MHC class II activation marker HLA-DR (CD4(+)DR(+)) and naïve CD4(+)CD45RA(+) T cells in basal conditions. GA treatment induced a specific and significant decrease of circulating CD19(+) B cells. Naïve-to-treatment RRMS patients also showed a significantly higher number of CD4(+) T cells with a memory phenotype (CD4(+)CD45RO(+)) whose peripheral frequency was not affected by GA treatment. These changes over time associated with a higher serum concentration of leptin and lower levels of MPO. GA treatment also reduced significantly the circulating levels of sCD40-L and sTNF-R overtime.Our data suggest that the clinical outcome of GA treatment is associated with changes in immune cell subpopulations and modulation of specific immunometabolic markers.

Here, we found that high-fat diet promoted the lipid accumulation and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in mice, while oral melatonin supplementation alleviated the lipid accumulation and reversed gut microbiota dysbiosis, including the diversity of intestinal microbiota, relative abundances of Bacteroides and Alistipes, and functional profiling of microbial communities, such as energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. Interestingly, melatonin failed to alleviate the high-fat-induced lipid accumulation in antibiotic-treated mice; however, microbiota transplantation from melatonin-treated mice alleviated high-fat diet-induced lipid  disorders. Notably, short-chain fatty acids were decreased in high-fat diet-fed mice, while melatonin treatment improved the production of acetic acid. Correlation analysis found a marked correlation between production of acetic acid and relative abundances of Bacteroides and Alistipes. Importantly, sodium  treatment also alleviated high-fat diet-induced lipid  disorders. Taken together, our results suggest that melatonin improves lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-fed mice, and the potential mechanisms may be associated with reprogramming gut microbiota, especially, Bacteroides and Alistipes-mediated acetic acid production.

In addition, we searched for eligible interventions that improved the metabolism of glucose and lipids.We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases from inception to May 2018. Publication types that were categorized as randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. The main outcome included the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total triglycerides. We performed both a pairwise meta-analysis and a network meta-analysis to evaluate the mean difference value and 95% credibility intervals, and we calculated the surface cumulative rank curve.There were a total of 12 kinds of interventions: metformin, 2 mg cyproterone  plus 0.05 mg ethinylestradiol (EE/CA), 0.15 mg desogestrel plus 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol (EE/DSG), and 3 mg drospirenone plus 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol (EE/DRSP), lifestyle, exercise, diet, metformin + lifestyle, metformin + diet, EE/CA + lifestyle, metformin + EE/CA, and EE/DRSP + lifestyle from the 20 eligible RCTs that were included in this study. Our meta-analysis results showed that metformin + lifestyle (MD = -2.04, 95% CrI = -3.64 to -0.41), EE/CA + lifestyle (MD = -2.23, 95% CrI = -4.11 to -0.35), and EE/DRSP + lifestyle (MD = -2.59, 95% CrI = -4.66 to -0.50) resulted in lower in the levels of total cholesterol. Women treated with metformin + lifestyle (MD = -1.82, 95% CrI = -2.88 to -0.79), EE/CA + lifestyle (MD = -2.25, 95% CrI = -3.58 to -1.08), or EE/DRSP + lifestyle (MD = -2.29, 95% CrI = -3.69 to -1.07) exhibited significantly lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when compared with the placebo group. There was no significant difference between any of the interventions compared with a placebo in the levels of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and total triglycerides. The surface cumulative rank curve revealed that metformin + lifestyle might be the best intervention with respect to the improvement of the homeostasis model of assessment insulin resistance and EE/DRSP + lifestyle appeared to be the best intervention for the reduction of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Moreover, the metformin + diet intervention was more effective in reducing the level of total triglycerides.For overweight polycystic ovary  patients, our evidence revealed that EE/CA and EE/SRSP combined with metformin or lifestyle changes can reduce the adverse effects on glucose and lipid metabolism of the use of oral contraceptive agents alone. Conventional PCOS treatments, such as metformin, EE/CA, and EE/DRSP, combined with lifestyle control can be particularly effective in improving the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30869790>Isocaloric Fructose Restriction Reduces Serum d-Lactate Concentration in Children With Obesity and .</a></h2><p>To investigate the link between dietary sugar consumption and two separate pathogenetic mechanisms associated with : de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and nonenzymatic glycation.We assessed changes in serum d-lactate (the detoxification end-product of methylglyoxal) concentration in response to 9 days of isocaloric fructose restriction in 20 children with obesity and , and examined correlations with changes in DNL, liver fat, insulin sensitivity, and other metrics of hepatic metabolism.Nine days of dietary sugar restriction, with substitution of equal amounts of refined starch.On days 0 and 10, children had laboratory evaluation of d-lactate levels and other analytes, and underwent oral glucose tolerance testing, magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify fat depots, and 13C- incorporation into triglyceride (TG) to measure DNL.d-Lactate was associated with baseline liver fat fraction (P < 0.001) and visceral adipose tissue (P < 0.001) but not with subcutaneous adipose tissue.

The anti-insulin resistance effects of BE and EE were evaluated on palmitate induced insulin resistance model of H4IIE, C2C12 and 3T3L1 cells by using several  parameters. Specifically, whole genome transcriptome analysis was performed by using microarray over 55.000 genes in control, insulin resistant and EE (25 µg/mL) treated insulin resistant H4IIE cells. Anti-inflammatory effects of both extracts were analyzed in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages.Both EE and BE at low doses (25-50 µg/mL) significantly decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis in H4IIE cell line by suppressing the expression of PEPCK and G6Pase. In C2C12 myotubes, both extracts increased the insulin stimulated glucose uptake more effectively than metformin. Both extracts decreased the isoproterenol induced lipolysis in 3T3L1 cell line. Moreover, they also effectively increased the expression of lipoprotein lipase protein level in insulin resistant myotubes at low doses. EE increased the protein level of PPARγ and stimulated the activation AKT in insulin resistant H4IIE and C2C12 cell lines. The results obtained from biochemical assays, mRNA/protein studies and whole genome transcriptome analyses were found to be complementary and provided support for the hypothesis that EE might be biologically active against insulin resistance and act through the inhibition of liver gluconeogenesis and AKT activation. Besides, LPS induced inflammation in RAW264.7 macrophages was mainly inhibited by EE through suppression of iNOS/NO signaling, IL1β and COX-2 genes. HPLC-TOF/MS analysis of EE of L. stoechas mainly resulted in caffeic acid, apigenin, luteolin, rosmarinic acid and its methyl ester, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, ferrulic acid and salicylic acid.Data suggest that EE of L. stoechas contains phytochemicals that can be effective in the treatment/prevention of insulin resistance and inflammation.

Patients with CKD are at greater risk of developing PEW since the progression of their disease can cause decreased nutrient intake, catabolic effects, systemic inflammation and  changes. Providers can detect PEW in CKD by identifying low serum levels ≤3.8 g/dl of albumin, <30 mg/dl of transthyretin, or <100 mg/dl of cholesterol. Other characteristics include BMI <22 kg/m(2) (for ≤65 years), unintentional weight loss of ≥5% in three months or ≥10% in six months, body fat percentage <10%, with muscle wasting of a reduction of ≥5% in three months or ≥10% in six months of muscle mass.A review of research was completed and data collected from small population-based retrospective studies to determine the effect of MA.Clinical trials demonstrated the effectiveness of MA by showing increases in BMI up to 9%, albumin levels up to 1.1 g/dl, with reported protein and energy intake increases from 27% to 42%. There are potential adverse effects of using MA in CKD.After reviewing the available literature, the benefits of using MA should be evaluated against the potential side effects.

In this study we investigated whether 3Ac-OA exerted beneficial effect on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in rats and its potential underlying mechanisms. Treatment with 3Ac-OA (1-100 μmol/L) dose-dependently decreased the intracellular levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) in FFA-treated primary rat hepatocytes and human HepG2 cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, oil red staining studies showed that 3Ac-OA caused dose-dependent decrease in the number of lipid droplets in FFA-treated primary rat hepatocytes. SD rats were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks and subsequently treated with 3Ac-OA (60, 30, 15 mg·kg·d) for 4 weeks. 3Ac-OA administration significantly decreased the body weight, liver weight and serum TC, TG, LDL-C levels in HFD rats. Furthermore, 3AcOA administration ameliorated lipid accumulation and cell apoptosis in the liver of HFD rats. Using adipokine array analyses, we found that the levels of 11 adipokines (HGF, ICAM, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-5, IGFBP-6, lipocalin-2, MCP-1, M-CSF, Pref-1 and RAGE) were increased by more than twofold in the serum of 3Ac-OA-treated rats, whereas ICAM, IGF-1 and lipocalin-2 had levels increased by more than 20-fold. Moreover, 3Ac-OA administration significantly increased the expression of glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT-2) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), as well as the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), protein kinase B (AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) in the liver tissues of HFD rats.

Gut microbiota can cause symptoms of  in pregnant women. Increased gut permeability is also involved in  disorders in non-pregnant hosts. However, longitudinal studies investigating the changes in  characteristics, gut microbiota, and gut permeability of sows throughout pregnancy and lactation are lacking.

Results showed that insulin sensitivity was decreased in L3. Circulating concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 increased in G109 and L3. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V3-V4 region showed that gut microbiota changed dramatically across different reproductive stages.

Furthermore, levels of fecal lipocalin-2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α were increased in G109 and L3. In contrast, fecal levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were significantly decreased in G109 and L3.

These defects lead to a complex multisystem inflammatory and .Although biologic therapies aimed at blocking the inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 1 can significantly reduce inflammation, they cannot completely control the clinical symptoms that affect the nervous system. For this reason, MKD can still be considered an orphan drug disease. The availability of MKD models reproducing the MKD-systematic inflammation, is crucial to improve the knowledge on its pathogenesis, which is still unknown. New therapies are also required in order to improve pateints' conditions and their quality of life.MKD-cellular models can be obtained by biochemical inhibition of mevalonatederived isoprenoids. Of note, these cells present an exaggerated response to inflammatory stimuli that can be reduced by treatment with zaragozic acid, an inhibitor of squalene synthase, thus increasing the availability of isoprenoids intermediates upstream the enzymatic block.A similar action might be obtained by lapaquistat  (TAK-475, Takeda), a drug that underwent extensive clinical trials as a cholesterol lowering agent 10 years ago, with a good safety profile.Here we describe the preclinical evidence supporting the possible repositioning of TAK-475 from its originally intended use to the treatment of MKD and discuss its potential to modulate the mevalonate pathway in inflammatory diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29113318>Follicular  changes and effects on oocyte quality in polycystic ovary  patients.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary  (PCOS) is a common complex and heterogeneous disorder, affecting up to 10% women at reproductive age. It causes three fourth of the ovulatory infertility and PCOS patients often give poor IVF quality. Although some  profiles have been investigated in PCOS patient sera and urine, the follicular fluid, providing fruitful biochemical information about oocyte environment during development has been ignored. In this work, based on NMR metabolomics approach,  profile of follicular fluid of PCOS patients has been explored and compared with healthy controls. Significant increases of glycoprotein, , cholesterol, significant decreases of lactic acid, glutamine, pyruvate, and alanine, have been discovered in PCOS follicular fluids. Furthermore, the Pearson correlations analysis indicated significant relationship existed between ART results and NMR detected follicular metabolites. All these results indicated that PCOS may induce dyslipidemia, low-grade inflammation, and disorder of glycolysis, pyruvate and amino acid metabolism in follicular fluids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25686106>The ketone metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate blocks NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammatory disease.</a></h2><p>The ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc) support mammalian survival during states of energy deficit by serving as alternative sources of ATP. BHB levels are elevated by starvation, caloric restriction, high-intensity exercise, or the low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet. Prolonged fasting reduces inflammation; however, the impact that ketones and other alternative  fuels produced during energy deficits have on the innate immune response is unknown. We report that BHB, but neither AcAc nor the structurally related short-chain fatty acids butyrate and , suppresses activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to urate crystals, ATP and lipotoxic fatty acids. BHB did not inhibit caspase-1 activation in response to pathogens that activate the NLR family, CARD domain containing 4 (NLRC4) or absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome and did not affect non-canonical caspase-11, inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, BHB inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by preventing K(+) efflux and reducing ASC oligomerization and speck formation. The inhibitory effects of BHB on NLRP3 are not dependent on chirality or starvation-regulated mechanisms like AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagy or glycolytic inhibition. BHB blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome without undergoing oxidation in the TCA cycle, and independently of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), sirtuin-2 (SIRT2), the G protein-coupled receptor GPR109A or hydrocaboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2). BHB reduces NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 production in human monocytes. In vivo, BHB or a ketogenic diet attenuates caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in mouse models of NLRP3-mediated diseases such as Muckle-Wells , familial cold autoinflammatory  and urate crystal-induced peritonitis. Our findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of caloric restriction or ketogenic diets may be linked to BHB-mediated inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30563420>Hydrogen cross-feeders of the human gastrointestinal tract.</a></h2><p>Hydrogen plays a key role in many microbial  pathways in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) that have an impact on human nutrition, health and wellbeing. Hydrogen is produced by many members of the GIT microbiota, and may be subsequently utilized by cross-feeding microbes for growth and in the production of larger molecules. Hydrogenotrophic microbes fall into three functional groups: sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogenic archaea and acetogenic bacteria, which can convert hydrogen into hydrogen sulfide, methane and , respectively. Despite different energy yields per molecule of hydrogen used between the functional groups, all three can coexist in the human GIT. The factors affecting the numerical balance of hydrogenotrophs in the GIT remain unconfirmed. There is increasing evidence linking both hydrogen sulfide and methane to GIT diseases such as irritable bowel , and strategies for the mitigation of such health problems through targeting of hydrogenotrophs constitute an important field for further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28447864>The use of cyproterone /ethinyl estradiol in hyperandrogenic skin symptoms - a review.</a></h2><p>Hyperandrogenism affects approximately 10-20% of women of reproductive age. Hyperandrogenic skin symptoms such as hirsutism, acne, seborrhea and alopecia are associated with significant quality of life and psychological impairment. Women with abnormalities in androgen metabolism may have accompanying anovulation and/or polycystic ovary  (PCOS), both of which have reproductive and  implications if left untreated. Cyproterone  (CPA), combined with ethinylestradiol (EE), is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe acne related to androgen-sensitivity (with or without seborrhea) and/or hirsutism, in women of reproductive age.To review the data on the efficacy and safety of CPA 2 mg/EE 35 μg for the treatment of hyperandrogenic skin symptoms in women.A non-systematic narrative review based on a literature search of the PubMed database.Seventy-eight studies were identified. The majority of sufficiently powered studies show a high efficacy of CPA 2 mg/EE 35 μg in the treatment of severe acne and hirsutism. Studies show that therapeutic response in women with hirsutism requires a long-term approach and that hyperandrogenic skin symptoms in patients with PCOS are efficiently treated. Additional benefits include cycle control and, in some women, improvement in mood and perception of body image. Safety and tolerability data are summarized by the pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee (PRAC) of the European Medicine's Agency's (EMA).This review provides a comprehensive overview about the efficacy of CPA 2 mg/EE 35 μg in the treatment of hyperandrogenic skin symptoms, thus allowing both health care professionals and women to balance the risks and benefits of treatment based on evidence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26220113>Impact of fetal chromosomal disorders on maternal blood metabolome: toward new biomarkers?</a></h2><p>This study aimed at determining the relationship between fetal chromosomal disorders (CDs), including trisomy 21 (T21), and on first- and second-trimester maternal blood plasma, to identify the time-course  adaptations to the conditions and the possible new plasma biomarkers. Furthermore, a definition of a joint circulatory (plasma) and excretory (urine)  description of second-trimester CDs was sought.Plasma was obtained for 119 pregnant women: 74 controls and 45 CD cases, including 22 T21 cases. Plasma and lipid extracts (for T21 only) were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and data were handled by variable selection and multivariate analysis. Correlation analysis was used on a concatenated plasma/urine matrix descriptive of second-trimester CD, based on previously obtained urine data.CD cases were accompanied by enhanced lipid β-oxidation (increased ketone bodies) and underutilization of glucose, pyruvate, and citrate. Lower circulating high-density lipoprotein levels were noted, along with changes in the proline and methanol in the first trimester, and also the urea, creatinine, , and low-density lipoprotein plus very low-density lipoprotein in the second trimester and the different urea and creatinine levels, suggesting fetal renal dysfunction. In terms of plasma composition, T21 cases were indistinguishable from other CDs in the first trimester, whereas in the second trimester, increased methanol and albumin may be T21 specific. Furthermore, first-trimester lipid extracts of T21 showed decreased levels of 18:2 fatty acids, whereas in the second trimester, lower levels of 20:4 and 22:6 fatty acids were noted, possibly indicative of inflammation mechanisms. In both trimesters, high classification rates for CDs (88-89%) and T21 (85-92%) generally relied on variable selection of nuclear magnetic resonance data. Plasma/urine correlations confirmed most  deviations and unveiled possible new ones regarding low-density lipoprotein plus very low-density lipoprotein, sugar, and gut-microflora metabolisms.This work partially confirmed previously reported data on first-trimester T21 and provided additional information on time-course  changes accompanying CD and T21, in particular regarding plasma lipid composition. These results demonstrate the potential of plasma metabolomics in monitoring and characterizing CD cases; however, validation in larger cohorts is desirable.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 240 PCOS women were randomly allocated to orlistat plus Diane-35(OD group), metformin plus Diane-35(MD group), orlistat plus metformin plus Diane-35(OMD group) or Diane-35 (D group). Body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumference, blood pressure, endocrine profile, lipid profile and insulin resistance were assessed at baseline and after 3 months. Significant reductions in waist and hip circumference, serum LH, total testosterone and uric acid were observed in all groups compared with baseline. TG and TC significantly decreased in the OD group. Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index was reduced in the OD (p = .015), MD (p = .001) and OMD (p = .004) groups. Body weight, BMI, systolic BP and HDL-C significantly changed in the OD and OMD group compared with the D group (p < .05). Side effects were less with orlistat than metformin.

Here we examine the expression levels of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes and their relationship with the lipogenic, antioxidant and oxidative potential of adipocytes generated from visceral ASCs (adipo-visASCs) and subcutaneous ASCs (adipo-subASCs) from subjects with different  profiles.Paired samples of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue were processed to isolate the respective ASCs from normal-weight (Nw) subjects and obese patients with  (METS) and without METS (NonMETS). qPCR was used to quantify the expression levels of the genes studied in both adipo-ASCs from the patient groups and those generated after silencing by small interfering RNA of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes. The accumulation of lipids was quantified by absorbance.No significant differences in cell yield or CD34CD31CD45 ASC percentage were observed between the different patient groups. Unlike adipo-visASCs, adipo-subASCs from METS patients showed a decrease in expression levels of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes as well as proteins linked to lipogenesis, antioxidant defense and fatty acid oxidation. Transcriptional silencing of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes in adipo-subASCs reduced lipid accumulation and affected transcription levels of lipogenic and antioxidant defense proteins.Adipo-subASCs may be more susceptible than adipo-visASCs to deterioration of the lipogenic, oxidative and antioxidant potential associated with .

The diagnosis of cancer cachexia depends on objective measures of clinical symptoms and a history of weight loss, which lag behind disease progression and have limited utility for the early diagnosis of cancer cachexia. In this study, we performed a nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics analysis to reveal the  profile of cancer cachexia and establish a diagnostic model.Eighty-four cancer cachexia patients, 33 pre-cachectic patients, 105 weight-stable cancer patients, and 74 healthy controls were included in the training and validation sets. Comparative analysis was used to elucidate the distinct metabolites of cancer cachexia, while  pathway analysis was employed to elucidate reprogramming pathways. Random forest, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to select and validate the biomarker metabolites and establish a diagnostic model.Forty-six cancer cachexia patients, 22 pre-cachectic patients, 68 weight-stable cancer patients, and 48 healthy controls were included in the training set, and 38 cancer cachexia patients, 11 pre-cachectic patients, 37 weight-stable cancer patients, and 26 healthy controls were included in the validation set. All four groups were age-matched and sex-matched in the training set. Metabolomics analysis showed a clear separation of the four groups. Overall, 45 metabolites and 18  pathways were associated with cancer cachexia. Using random forest analysis, 15 of these metabolites were identified as highly discriminating between disease states. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to create a distinct diagnostic model with an area under the curve of 0.991 based on three metabolites. The diagnostic equation was Logit(P) = -400.53 - 481.88 × log(Carnosine) -239.02 × log(Leucine) + 383.92 × log(Phenyl ), and the result showed 94.64% accuracy in the validation set.This metabolomics study revealed a distinct  profile of cancer cachexia and established and validated a diagnostic model.

Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a marker associated with adverse cardiovascular events. In this study, we aimed to investigate MPV levels under ethinyl estradiol/cyproterone  or metformin therapy for the previous 6 months in PCOS. A total of 114 individuals [metformin treatment (n = 18), ethinyl estradiol/cyproterone  treatment (n = 29), newly diagnosed PCOS patient with no treatment (n = 35), and control group of eumenorrheic healthy individuals (n = 32)] were included in the current study. Hematologic parameters other than MPV were similar in all groups. The MPV value was significantly higher in the newly diagnosed PCOS patients compared with the other three groups independent of age, BMI, and C-reactive protein level in multiple regression analysis (P < 0.01). The MPV value of control group was comparable to the groups under ethinyl estradiol/cyproterone  or metformin therapy (P = 1.0). There was no statistically significant difference in the white blood cell count among the groups. The MPV values were positively correlated with the homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance and Ferriman-Gallwey Score (P = 0.044, r = 0.261; P = 0.037, r = 0.229, respectively). Ethinyl estradiol/cyproterone  and metformin similarly appear to decrease MPV, a marker of cardiovascular risk. Therefore, a possible beneficial effect of ethinyl estradiol/cyproterone  and metformin on long-term cardiovascular morbidities in PCOS may be suggested.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29158587>Analysis of the gut microbiome and plasma short-chain fatty acid profiles in a spontaneous mouse model of .</a></h2><p>Male Tsumura Suzuki obese diabetes (TSOD) mice spontaneously develop obesity and obesity-related . Gut dysbiosis, an imbalance of gut microbiota, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of , but its mechanisms are unknown. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main fermentation products of gut microbiota and a link between the gut microbiota and the host's physiology. Here, we investigated a correlation among gut dysbiosis, SCFAs, and  in TSOD mice. We detected enriched levels of Gram-positive bacteria and corresponding decreases in Gram-negative bacteria in 24-wk-old -affected TSOD mice compared with age-matched controls. The abundance of Bacteroidetes species decreased, the abundance of Firmicutes species increased, and nine genera of bacteria were altered in 24-wk-old TSOD mice. The total plasma SCFA level was significantly lower in the TSOD mice than in controls. The major plasma SCFA--decreased in TSOD mice, whereas propionate and butyrate increased. TSOD mice had no minor SCFAs (valerate and hexanoate) but normal mice did. We thus concluded that gut dysbiosis and consequent disruptions in plasma SCFA profiles occurred in -affected TSOD mice.

Our previous data suggested that the RNA-binding protein CsrA plays an important role in regulating several important phenotypes including motility, biofilm formation, and oxidative stress resistance. In this study, we compared the proteomes of wild type, csrA mutant, and complemented csrA mutant C. jejuni strains in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms by which CsrA affects virulence phenotypes. The putative CsrA regulon was more pronounced at stationary phase (111 regulated proteins) than at mid-log phase (25 regulated proteins). Proteins displaying altered expression in the csrA mutant included diverse  functions, with roles in amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle,  metabolism, and various other cell processes, as well as pathogenesis-associated characteristics such as motility, chemotaxis, oxidative stress resistance, and fibronectin binding. The csrA mutant strain also showed altered autoagglutination kinetics when compared to the wild type. CsrA specifically bound the 5' end of flaA mRNA, and we demonstrated that CsrA is a growth-phase dependent repressor of FlaA expression. Finally, the csrA mutant exhibited reduced ability to colonize in a mouse model when in competition with the wild type, further underscoring the role of CsrA in C. jejuni colonization and pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28824323> leaf extract improves fatty liver  by increasing lipid oxidation and decreasing the lipogenesis pathway in mice.</a></h2><p>Some members of  genus are traditionally used as medicinal plants for arthritis, acute and chronic bronchitis, asthma, pain, inflammation, rheumatism, hypertension and  diseases. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the protective effects of  leaf extract on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)  and . In this study, the effects of  leaf extract on inhibiting the free fatty acid (FFA)-induced accumulation of fat in HepG2 cells and on improving fatty liver  in mice with high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD were investigated. For the  assay, HepG2 cells were treated with FFAs (oleate/palmitate = 2:1) with or without treatment with  leaf ethyl  (EtOAc) fraction to observe lipid accumulation using Nile red and oil red O stains. For the  assay, C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to three groups ( = 5), including the normal diet group, the HFD group and the HFD+EtOAc group. After 11 weeks, body weight, serum biochemical indices and the mRNA expressions of the liver tissue, as well as the outward appearance, weight and histopathological analysis of liver and adipose tissues were evaluated. Among the fractions derived from  leaf, the EtOAc fraction exhibited a strong fat-accumulation inhibitory activity. Following reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), four specific phytochemicals, including (2, 3)-astilbin (AS), hyposide (HY), guaijaverin (GU) and quercitrin (QU), were isolated and identified from the EtOAc fraction of  leaf extract. Among them, AS and HY showed excellent fat-accumulation inhibitory activity. Thus, the EtOAc fraction of  leaf and its derived phytochemicals have great potential in preventing FFA-induced fat accumulation. In addition, the EtOAc fraction of  leaf significantly improved fatty liver  and reduced total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) in HFD-induced NAFLD mice at a dosage of 200 mg/kg BW. These results demonstrated that the methanolic extracts from  leaf have excellent inhibitory activities against fat accumulation and anti-NAFLD activities and thus have great potential as a natural health product.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28501098>Alterations in intestinal microbiota relate to intestinal failure-associated liver disease and central line infections.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota plays a vital role in modulating the  and immune functions of the intestines.

OCP was administered in cycles of 28 days (21 pills containing 35μg of ethinylestradiol plus 2mg of cyproterone  followed by 7 placebo pills) for six cycles and metformin 500mg was administered twice daily for 6 months. Clinical, anthropometric, hormonal and  parameters and resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) of both ovarian stromal vessels were assessed before and after treatment.OCP resulted in a higher reduction in serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and androgens whereas metformin resulted in significant reduction in BMI, waist circumference, and insulin resistance. There was a significant increase in RI and PI of both ovarian stromal vessels with both drugs post-treatment, however, the increase was more prominent in the OCP group. There was a significant negative correlation between changes in LH and testosterone levels with changes in PI and RI in OCP group whereas changes in serum fasting insulin levels negatively correlated with changes in PI and RI values in the Metformin group.Treatment with both OCP and metformin leads to a reduction in ovarian stromal vascularization in PCOS women perhaps through different mechanisms and this reduction is more prominent with OCP.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Gut microbiota was analysed on the basis of 16S rDNA with quantitative real time PCR. Additionally, a food frequency questionnaire with questions to nutritional behaviour, lifestyle, and physical activity was administered before intervention. After weight reduction, obese individuals showed a significant increase of total bacterial abundance. The ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes significantly decreased during intervention. Lactobacilli significantly increased between the first and the second time point. These differences also correlated with differences in weight percentage. During the intervention period Clostridium cluster IV increased significantly between the second and the third time point. In contrast Clostridium cluster XIVa showed a decreased abundance. The dominant butyrate producer, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, significantly increased as did the abundance of the butyryl-CoA:  CoA-transferase gene. Archaea and Akkermansia were significantly more prevalent after weight reduction. Our results show a clear difference in the gut bacterial composition before and after dietary intervention with a rapid change in gut microbial composition after a few weeks, but also indicate that a major shift requires long term dietary treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26525535>Microbiota-Dependent Hepatic Lipogenesis Mediated by Stearoyl CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) Promotes  in TLR5-Deficient Mice.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota plays a key role in host metabolism. Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), a flagellin receptor, is required for gut microbiota homeostasis. Accordingly, TLR5-deficient (T5KO) mice are prone to develop microbiota-dependent . Here we observed that T5KO mice display elevated neutral lipids with a compositional increase of oleate [C18:1 (n9)] relative to wild-type littermates. Increased oleate contribution to hepatic lipids and liver SCD1 expression were both microbiota dependent. Analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and (13)C- label incorporation revealed elevated SCFA in ceca and hepatic portal blood and increased liver de novo lipogenesis in T5KO mice. Dietary SCFAs further aggravated  in T5KO mice. Deletion of hepatic SCD1 not only prevented hepatic neutral lipid oleate enrichment but also ameliorated  in T5KO mice. Collectively, these results underscore the key role of the gut microbiota-liver axis in the pathogenesis of  diseases.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to compare clinical and para-clinical responses to the treatment of phlebotomy using oral contraceptive pills (OCs) containing cyproterone  in women with PCOS.In this randomized clinical trial, 64 patients with PCOS were randomly assigned to the phlebotomy and OCs groups (n = 32 in each group). The intervention group, using a single treatment procedure, underwent venesection of 450 mL of whole blood at the early follicular phase of the spontaneous or progesterone-induced menstrual cycle. The control group received OCs pills for 3 months from the 1th day of spontaneous or progesterone-induced menstrual cycle onwards for 3 weeks, followed by a pill-free interval of 7 days. The women were evaluated after the 3-month intervention. The primary outcome measure was a change in the HOMA-IR and free androgen index (FAI). Secondary outcomes were changes in the Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) score and other clinical, biochemical and hormonal changes from the baseline (pre-treatment) to week 12.In the phlebotomy group, 27 (84.3%) and in the OCs group 30 (93.7%) of the women completed the 3-month follow-up. The median HOMA-IR significantly decreased from 3.5 to 2.7 in the phlebotomy, and from 3.1 to 2.8 in the OCs group, and the changes were comparable between the groups. Median changes in the FAI significantly decreased in both groups, but the differences were not statistically significant between the groups (P = 0.061). With regard to secondary outcomes, mean FG scores in both groups significantly decreased [from 16.8 (6) to 13.3 (7.4), P < 0.028] in the phlebotomy group and [from 14.3 (7) to 9.8 (7.6) in the OCs group, P = 0.001] after 3 months of treatment, but such changes had no statistically significant differences between the groups. During treatment, menstrual cycles became regular in all women in the OCs group and in 12.27 (44.4%) of the women in the phlebotomy group, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.001). Despite no statistically significant differences in lipid profiles between the groups at the baseline, triglycerides were significantly higher in the OCs group compared to the phlebotomy at end of follow up (p = 0.019).Both treatment modalities had similar beneficial effects on insulin resistance and on androgenic profiles. However, OCs was reported more effective in treating menstrual irregularities and phlebotomy had less adverse effects on triglyceride concentrations.Code: IRCT2013080514277N1 .</p></html>
