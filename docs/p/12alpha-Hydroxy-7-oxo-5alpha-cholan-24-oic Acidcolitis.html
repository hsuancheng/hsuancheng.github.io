As the therapeutically active component of bear bile, it has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese Medicine to treat a range of conditions, while manufactured UDCA has been used for decades in Western medicine to treat cholestatic liver diseases. The beneficial qualities of UDCA are thought to be due to its well-established cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions. In addition to its established role in treating liver disease(s), UDCA is now under investigation for numerous conditions associated with inflammation and apoptosis, including neurological, ocular, metabolic, and cardiovascular disorders. Here, we review the growing evidence base from  and  models to suggest that UDCA may also have a role to play in the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553934>The non-euphoric phytocannabinoid cannabidivarin counteracts intestinal inflammation in mice and cytokine expression in biopsies from UC pediatric patients.</a></h1><p>Patients with ulcerative  (UC) using marijuana have been reported to experience symptomatic benefit. Cannabidivarin (CBDV) is a safe non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid able to activate and desensitize TRPA1, a member of the TRP channels superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in intestinal inflammation. Here, we have investigated the potential intestinal anti-inflammatory effect of CBDV in mice and in biopsies from pediatric patients with active UC. Colonic inflammation was induced in mice by dinitrobenzenesulfonic  (DNBS). The effect of orally administered CBDV on macroscopic and microscopic damage, inflammatory parameters (i.e. myeloperoxidase activity, intestinal permeability and cytokine production) and faecal microbiota composition, was evaluated 3 days after DNBS administration. TRPA1 expression was studied by RT-PCR in inflamed colons of mice as well as in mucosal colonic biopsies of children with active UC, whose response to incubation with CBDV was also investigated. CBDV attenuates, in a TRPA1-antagonist sensitive manner, DNBS-induced signs of inflammation including neutrophil infiltration, intestinal permeability, and cytokine (i.e. IL-1β, IL-6 and the chemokine MCP-1) production. CBDV also alters the dysregulation of gut microbiota associated to . Finally, CBDV lessens cytokine expression in colonic biopsies from pediatric patients with ulcerative , a condition in which TRPA1 was up-regulated. Our preclinical study shows that CBDV exerts intestinal anti-inflammatory effects in mice via TRPA1, and in children with active UC. Since CBDV has a favorable safety profile in humans, it may be considered for possible clinical trials in patients with UC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The results revealed that AA-2βG had palliating effects on DSS-induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in terms of slowing down the trends of body weight and solid fecal mass loss, reducing  disease activity index, improving serum physiological and biochemical indicators, increasing colon length, blocking proinflammatory cytokines, and increasing tight junction proteins. Additionally, AA-2βG treatment could promote the production of short-chain fatty  and modulate the composition of the gut microbiota. The key bacteria related to IBD were found to be Porphyromonadaceae, Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, ,  and . The results indicated that AA-2βG might treat IBD through the regulation of gut microbiota, suggesting that AA-2βG has the potential to be used as a dietary supplement in the treatment of IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31420448>Molecular features of lipoprotein CD0873: A potential vaccine against the human pathogen .</a></h1><p> is the primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and , a healthcare-associated intestinal disease resulting in a significant fatality rate.

However, the mechanism of GA in UC remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of GA on UC from the perspective of gut microbiota and supervised the metabolic alterations in vivo with 1H NMR-based metabolomics, which can provide a holistic view to understand the functions of GA in UC. Rats with dextra sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  were rectally administrated with GA (6 mg kg-1) for 8 consecutive days. 16S gene sequencing was performed on feces samples to obtain bacterial community information. Urine and feces samples were analyzed with 1H NMR spectroscopy, and short chain fatty  (SCFAs) in feces and colon contents were detected with gas chromatography. Our results showed that UC syndromes in the GA group were significantly attenuated. The microbial alterations in the DSS group were characterized by a decrease of probiotic bacteria, such as Lactobacillaceae and Prevotellaceae, and an increase of some pathogenic species, mainly in the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla. GA treatment could modulate the microbiota composition towards a similar proportion to the control group. Metabolic data further revealed that the GA-induced metabolic changes focus on increasing carbohydrate metabolism (gluco-related metabolism) and bile  (BA) metabolism and decreasing amino  metabolism, which also provides evidence for alteration of the microbiota because these feces metabolites are by-products of interactions between the host and the microbiota. These findings demonstrate GA-induced alterations in metabolic and bacterial profiles in DSS-, providing new insight into the attenuation of GA in UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250861>Docosapentaenoic  (DPA, 22:5n-3) ameliorates inflammation in an ulcerative  model.</a></h1><p>The anti-inflammatory profile of DPA was investigated via a dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced  model, and was also compared with those of EPA and DHA. The results showed that DPA could significantly reduce (stronger than EPA and DHA) the disease activity index score, macroscopic appearance score, colon shortening, histological assessment, and myeloperoxidase accumulation in the colon. In addition, DPA also inhibited the abnormal production and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 and improved the production and expression of an anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects were also explored through the synthesis pathway of eicosanoids. DPA could inhibit the synthesis of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) more greatly while differences of cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxidase (LOX) contents in these three groups were not significant. We ascribed these effects to the easier incorporation of DPA into inflammatory cells leading to the decrease in the substrate for the synthesis of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (PGE2 and LTB4). Besides, DPA-derived mediators might also be involved.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645725>Structural basis of species-selective antagonist binding to the succinate receptor.</a></h1><p>The tricarboxylic  cycle intermediate succinate is involved in metabolic processes and plays a crucial role in the homeostasis of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. The receptor responsible for succinate signalling, SUCNR1 (also known as GPR91), is a member of the G-protein-coupled-receptor family and links succinate signalling to renin-induced hypertension, retinal angiogenesis and inflammation. Because SUCNR1 senses succinate as an immunological danger signal-which has relevance for diseases including ulcerative , liver fibrosis, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis-it is of interest as a therapeutic target. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of rat SUCNR1 in complex with an intracellular binding nanobody in the inactive conformation. Structure-based mutagenesis and radioligand-binding studies, in conjunction with molecular modelling, identified key residues for species-selective antagonist binding and enabled the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a humanized rat SUCNR1 in complex with a high-affinity, human-selective antagonist denoted NF-56-EJ40. We anticipate that these structural insights into the architecture of the succinate receptor and its antagonist selectivity will enable structure-based drug discovery and will further help to elucidate the function of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220438>Flavonoids from Citrus aurantium ameliorate TNBS-induced ulcerative  through protecting colonic mucus layer integrity.</a></h1><p>Intestinal barrier injury is recognized as the main reason for ulcerative  (UC) which is a chronic inflammatory disease and the effective therapeutic methods remain limited. In this study, we explored the protection effects of naringenin, nobiletin and hesperetin from Citrus aurantium on colonic mucus layer integrity. The UC mice model was induced by trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS). Forty mg/kg/day of naringenin, nobiletin and hesperetin were administrated orally for 7 and 3 days before and after TNBS treatment. Then body weight, disease activity index (DAI) score and colon length were recorded. Colons were collected for immunofluorescence, RT-PCR and western blot assay. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cell-co-culture system of Caco-2 and RAW264.7 cells were used to determine activities on protecting intestinal epithelial monolayers damage. Our results showed that Naringenin, nobiletin and hesperetin alleviated body weight loss and colon shortness, decreased DAI score, and up-regulated claudin-2, occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression significantly. Meanwhile, the flavonoids enhanced trans epithelial electric resistance, decreased the permeability and up-regulated occludin and ZO-1 expression in LPS-damaged epithelial monolayers system. Hence, Naringnien, nobiletin and hesperetin show the regulatory effect on UC by protecting colonic mucosa layer integrity. It is suggested the flavonoids may be new supplements for the treatment of UC.Copyright © 2019.

Although 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) is used as a first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate UC, some patients do not react well to it. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays a complementary role in the management of UC. A large number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that TCM has a significant effect in the treatment of mild-to-moderate UC. However, due to the diversity of TCM treatments, its relative effectiveness and safety remains unclear. Therefore, we aim to compare the effectiveness and safety of TCM for mild-to-moderate UC by implementing a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) and provide a reference for clinical treatment.According to the Cochrane Handbook, PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CHKD-CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM), and WANFANG database will be searched. Related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared one TCM intervention with another or with 5-ASA (placebo) for mild-to-moderate UC from inceptions to February 2019 will be included. Two authors will screen the literature and extract data independently based on predesigned rules, and evaluate the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Both classical pair-wise meta-analysis and Bayesian NMA will be conducted using R-3.4.4 and WinBUGS-1.4.3 software. The ranking probabilities for all interventions will be estimated and the hierarchy of each intervention will be summarized as surface under the cumulative ranking curve. The consistency within network will be evaluated with Cochrane Q statistic and net-heat plot. The quality of evidence will be assessed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.The study results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal publication or conference presentation.The findings will provide a systematic evidence-based medical evidence of TCM interventions in the treatment of UC and help clinical practitioners, UC patients, and policy-makers make more informed choices in the decision-making.Ethical approval and informed consent are not required since this is a protocol for a network meta-analysis based on published studies.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible beneficial effects of ART on ulcerative  (UC) rats and to detect the possible mechanisms underlying these effects. A UC rat model was established using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Rats were randomly divided into the following groups: Normal control, UC model group, UC rats treated with a low, medium or high dose of ART (10, 30 and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively), and the positive control group (50 mg/kg/day 5‑aminosalicylic ). The damage status of colonic mucosal epithelial tissue was investigated by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and then the weight, colon length and disease activity index (DAI) were measured. Western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to detect the levels of cytokines associated with UC and proteins associated with Toll‑like receptor 4 (TLR4)‑nuclear factor (NF)‑κB pathway. ELISA was also performed to measure the levels of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, the viability and infiltration of RAW264.7 cells were examined using Cell Counting Kit‑8 and Transwell assays. The results demonstrated that treatment with ART significantly alleviated the UC symptoms induced by DSS in the rat model, lowered the DAI, ameliorated pathological changes, attenuated colon shortening, inhibited the levels of pro‑inflammatory mediators and myeloperoxidase activity, and increased hemoglobin expression. Additionally, inflammatory and apoptotic markers were found to be significantly downregulated following treatment with ART in UC rats and RAW264.7 cells. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that ART exerts anti‑inflammatory effects via regulating the TLR4‑NF‑κB signaling pathway in UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31477303>Protective effect of Lactobacillus fermentum CQPC04 on dextran sulfate sodium-induced  in mice is associated with modulation of the nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway.</a></h1><p> severely affects the quality of life of patients, and lactic  bacteria have been reported to be able to improve or treat . In this study, we selected a strain of Lactobacillus fermentum (CQPC04) with good resistance in vitro to evaluate its effect on improvement in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced . We analyzed the effects of L. fermentum CQPC04 on mice with  macroscopically via colon length and histopathology. We also used conventional biochemical and ELISA kits, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and Western blotting to analyze microscopically the effects of L. fermentum CQPC04 on related oxidant indices and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in serum and colon tissue of mice. The results indicated that L. fermentum CQPC04 notably increased colon length and ameliorated pathological damage of colon tissue in colitic mice. Serum indices showed that L. fermentum CQPC04 increased the enzyme activity of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and catalase (CAT) and decreased the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO). In addition, it inhibited the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12, and increased the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in serum. The RT-qPCR experiments confirmed that L. fermentum CQPC04 downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine nuclear factor-κB-p65 (NF-κBp65), NF-κB inhibitor-α (IκB-α), TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and upregulated the expression of IL-10 in colon tissue. Western blot analysis indicated that L. fermentum CQPC04 significantly reduced expression of NF-κBp65, TNF-α, IL-1β, COX-2, and iNOS in mouse colon tissues, and increased expression of IκB-α and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). Thus, L. fermentum CQPC04 could effectively alleviate the symptoms of DSS-induced  mice and is a potential probiotic for human experiments.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The rats were orally treated with different doses (50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) of C. mas 80% methanol extract for 14 days. Increase in body weight, consumed amount of feed, form of the stool, presence of rectal prolapse were followed every day. At the end of the experiment, colon tissues were removed and wet weights for each animal were measured and colon damages were scored. Total antioxidant and total oxidant status, cytokine (TNF-α and IL-1β) and protein levels of colon tissues were evaluated and histopathological analyses were carried out. After the detection of the effective dose as 400 mg/kg, the aqueous methanol extract was fractionated by using liquid-liquid fractionation technique and the sub-extracts were also tested for in vivo biological activities. High Performance Liquid Chromatography analyses were conducted to determine the phytochemical profile of the active crude extract and n-butanol sub-extract.Amount of feed consumed per day and increase in body weight were the lowest in the control group, while those values were determined to be the highest in 80% methanol extract (at 400 mg/kg dose), n-butanol sub-extract and reference groups. Following  induction, it was determined that the fecal form was yellow-slippery in all groups and returned to normal after the treatment with C. mas extracts. Rectal prolapse score was less in the extract (400 mg/kg) and n-butanol sub-extract treated groups. Total antioxidant, total oxidant status, cytokine and protein levels were found to be in parallel with macroscopic findings. 80% methanol extract (400 mg/kg) and n-butanol sub-extract provided the best healing according to the wet weight measurements and colon damage scoring performed on the removed colon tissues. These findings supported the results of histopathological analysis.

After the adaptation period, two groups of animals fed SD or HFD were subjected to 6 weeks of the forced treadmill exercise and the experimental  was induced in both groups of sedentary and exercising mice fed SD and HFD by intra-colonic administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic . The disease activity index (DAI), colonic blood flow (CBF), the weight of animals, caloric intake, the mesenteric fad pad, the colonic oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and intestinal expression and protein content of proinflammatory markers were evaluated. Macroscopic and microscopic  in sedentary SD mice was accompanied by a significant fall in CBF and exacerbated in those fed a HFD. The contents of MDA, GSH, and SOD activity were significantly increased in both SD and HFD fed mice with treadmill exercise as compared with sedentary mice. In sedentary HFD mice a significant increase in the intestinal oxidative stress parameters and mucosal expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-17, IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-10 protein were observed and these effects were aggravated in mice subjected to forced treadmill exercise. The mucosal expression of mRNA for TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, COX-2, SOD-1, SOD-2, GPx mRNAs, and the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α protein expression were upregulated in colonic mucosa of treadmill exercising HFD mice with  compared with those without exercise. We conclude that forced treadmill running exacerbates the severity of colonic damage in obese mice due to a fall in colonic microcirculation, an increase in oxidative stress, and the rise in expression and activity of proinflammatory biomarkers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406920>Cilostazol against 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic -induced : Effect on tight junction, inflammation, and apoptosis.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases are immunologically mediated disorders of gastrointestinal tract, characterized by dysregulated immune responses that result in a chronic intestinal inflammation. The antiplatelet cilostazol (CS), a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor, exerted a beneficial effect on several models of gastrointestinal diseases; however, the full mechanism of action in this context has not been unveiled.The current study aimed to elucidate the potential role of CS in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced  model.Male Wistar rats were divided into a sham group and groups treated with sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg), CS (50 and 100 mg/kg), and a combination (sulfasalazine/CS 50 mg/kg). All treatments were administered orally 15 days, with TNBS rectal administration on the 11th day.TNBS-produced  manifested as a decrease in the epithelial junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) and as an increase in trefoil factor-3, ulcerative area, and colon mass index, parameters that collaborate with the gross macroscopic changes in colon tissue. In addition, TNBS increased hemeoxygenase-1, nuclear factor-kappa B, P-selectin, and myeloperoxidase, as well as the apoptotic ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Administration of CS alone, especially at the high dose level, attenuated the severity of TNBS-induced  in a sulfasalazine-comparable manner. In addition, a better effect was mediated by the combination regimen, which succeeded in normalizing most of the measured parameters.CS protected the colon against TNBS through its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects along with maintaining cellular tight junctions (TJs).

Recent studies have thus sought to identify a dietary component that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling to ameliorate IBD. We now assessed if the lactic  bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1, an isolate from LAB, reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. We further tested whether EJ-1 alleviates  induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) in mice. TNBS significantly increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic  scores, and colon shortening. Oral administration of L. lactis EJ-1 resulted in an increase in TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, and nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; it also led to a marked reduction in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. L. lactis EJ-1 also inhibited the TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; however, it induced the expression of IL-10. M2 macrophage markers arginase I, IL-10 and CD206 were elevated by EJ-1.

However, the action mechanisms of sword bean have not yet been clearly defined. In the present study, the whole parts of a ripened sword bean (RSB) and the green sword bean (GSB) containing bean pod were extracted with ethanol by reflux extraction. The two crude extracts (RSBE and GSBE) from RSB and GSB were validated by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis of gallic  as a reference chemical. The anti-inflammatory effects of two sword bean extracts were extensively investigated using LPS-stimulated macrophage cells. First, RSBE and GSBE significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandinE (PGE), and nitric oxide (NO) in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. RSBE and GSBE showed no cytotoxicity to RAW264.7 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophage cells. In addition, the overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induced by LPS in RAW264.7 cells was significantly decreased by RSBE and GSBE.

The SFC derivatives were decoupled up to 72% in the cecal contents but remained stable in the small intestinal contents. Oral gavage of SFC-AA (oral SFC-AA, equivalent to 1.67 mg/kg of SFC) delivered SFC (maximal cecal concentration: 57.36 μM) to the cecum, while no SFC was detected with oral gavage of SFC (oral SFC, 1.67 mg/kg). Moreover, oral SFC-AA (equivalent to 10 mg/kg of SFC) did not afford detectable concentration of SFC in the blood but detected up to 4.64 μM with oral SFC (10 mg/kg), indicating efficient colonic delivery and limited systemic absorption of SFC upon oral SFC-AA. Oral SFC-AA ameliorated colonic damage and inflammation in rat  with elevating colonic levels of HO-1 and nuclear Nrf2 protein, and the anticolitic effects of SFC-AA were significantly undermined by an HO-1 inhibitor. At an equivalent dose of SFC, oral SFC-AA but not oral SFC increased colonic HO-1 and nuclear Nrf2 levels, and oral SFC-AA was more effective than oral SFC in treating rat . Moreover, oral SFC-AA was as effective against  as oral sulfasalazine being used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. In conclusion, colon-targeted delivery of SFC facilitated the therapeutic switching of the drug to an anticolitic drug via Nrf2 activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489829>Spray dried formulation of mesalamine embedded with probiotic biomass for the treatment of ulcerative :  and  studies.</a></h1><p>This study is using the targeted approach and anti-inflammatory action of the probiotic biomass to lessen the side effects of therapeutic agents of ulcerative . The aim of the present study is to prepare mesalamine loaded eudragit S-100 with probiotic microparticles by spray drying method. The  release of the optimized formulation was 90.55 ± 2.42 in 24 hr, which display controlled drug release of mesalamine at a particular region. Mesalamine loaded eudragit S-100 with probiotic microparticles (F12) presented average particle size of 4.91 µm. The statistical analysis was done by one way ANOVA and then comparison test of Bonferroni was done and  <.05 were considered as significant. The effects of spray dried microparticles over inflamed Caco-2 cell were also evaluated by determining the concentration of IL-8. From  study it was seen that pretreatment of mesalamine with probiotic prevents DNBS (Dinitrobenzenesulfonic ) induced  in rats and represents protective action against ulcerative  because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. The results give the foundation for a combination of targeted approach along with the anti-inflammatory potential of the probiotic which might help to decrease the problems which are seen with the traditional cure and management of ulcerative .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279995>Rapid Detection of Clostridium difficile Toxins in Stool by Raman Spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>Clinical practice guidelines define Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) as diarrhea (≥3 unformed stools in 24 h) with either a positive C difficile stool test or detection of pseudomembranous . Diagnostic modalities such as toxigenic culture and nucleic  amplification testing can identify the presence of toxigenic C difficile in stools. But these tests are confounded by the presence of asymptomatic colonization of toxigenic C difficile and lead to overdiagnosis of CDI. The presence of two large toxins, toxin A and B (TcdA and TcdB) is necessary for pathogenicity. Detection of toxins using toxin enzyme immunoassay is difficult as it has low sensitivity and moderate specificity. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a novel technology that is used to detect bacteria and their toxins. RS does not require any reagents for detection such as antibodies, enzymes, primers, or stains. We hypothesize that RS is a sensitive method to detect C difficile toxins in stool and will solve the problem of overdiagnosis of CDI.CDI negative stool samples were spiked with concentrations (1 ng/mL, 100 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, and 0.1 pg/mL) of TcdA and TcdB. RS was performed on air-dried smeared samples of stool supernatant on a mirror-polished stainless-steel slide. As RS of feces is difficult because of confounding background material and autofluorescence, samples were photo-bleached before spectral acquisition to reduce autofluorescence. Raman spectra were obtained, background corrected, and vector normalized. The data were split into training (70%) and test (30%) datasets. The machine learning methods used on the training data set were Support Vector Machine with Linear and Radial Kernels, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Boosting Machine, and Principle Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis. Results were validated using a test data set. The best model was chosen, and its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined.In our preliminary results, at all concentrations (1 ng/mL, 100 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, and 0.1 pg/mL), TcdA or TcdB spiked stool was distinguished from unspiked stool by all models with accuracies ranging from 64% to 77%. Gradient Boosting Machine, Principle Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine Linear Kernel performed best with sensitivities ranging from 69% to 90% and specificities ranging from 43% to 78%.Using RS, we successfully detected TcdA and TcdB in stool samples albeit with moderate-to-high sensitivity and low-to-moderate specificity. Sensitivity and specificity could be further increased with the implementation of deep learning methods, which require large sample sizes. In terms of sensitivity, RS performs better than toxin enzyme immunoassay and has the potential to rapidly detect C difficile toxins in stool at clinically relevant concentrations and thereby help mitigate overdiagnosis of CDI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we found that increased expression of E3 ligase FBXW7 in the inflamed intestine was significantly correlated to IBD severity in both human diseases and mice model. Myeloid-Fbxw7 deﬁciency protected mice from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and 2,6,4-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) induced . Fbxw7 deficiency resulted in decreased production of chemokines CCL2 and CCL7 by colonic CX3CR1hi resident macrophages and reduced accumulation of CX3CR1int pro-inﬂammatory MPh in  colon tissue. Mice received AAV-shFbxw7 administration showed significantly improved survival rate and alleviated . Mechanisms screening demonstrated that FBXW7 suppresses H3K27me3 modiﬁcation and promotes Ccl2 and Ccl7 expression via degradation of histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2 in macrophages. Taken together, our results indicate that FBXW7 degrades EZH2 and increases Ccl2/Ccl7 in CX3CR1hi macrophages, which promotes the recruiting CX3CR1int pro-inﬂammatory MPh into local colon tissues with .

Stimulation of NOD1 leads to a robust innate immune response via activation of the major transcription factor NF-κB. In addition to peptidoglycan sensing, NOD1 and the closely related PRR NOD2 have been linked to inflammation by responding to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR). Here we show that differential ER stress induction renders cells more susceptible to  serovar Typhimurium infection in a NOD1-dependent manner, measured by increased NF-κB activation and cytokine expression. In HeLa57A cells stably transfected with an NF-κB::luciferase reporter, we show that cells undergoing ER stress induced by thapsigargin display a significant increase in NF-κB activation in response to NOD1 stimulation by C12-iE-DAP (acylated derivative of the iE-DAP dipeptide [gamma-d-glutamyl--diaminopimelic ]) and the  Typhimurium effector protein SopE. Tunicamycin-induced ER stress had no effect on NOD1-stimulated NF-κB activation. We further show that the mouse intestinal epithelial cell line MODE-K and RAW264.7 macrophages are more responsive to  infection when treated with thapsigargin but not with tunicamycin. These profound differences between thapsigargin- and tunicamycin-treated cells upon inflammation suggest that different components downstream of the UPR contribute to NOD1 activation. We found that the NOD1-induced inflammatory response is dependent on protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) activation in conjunction with stimulation of the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R). Together, these results suggest that differential UPR activation makes cells more responsive to bacterial infections in a NOD1-dependent manner.Copyright © 2019 Mendez et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536771>Seaweed natural products modify the host inflammatory response via Nrf2 signaling and alter colon microbiota composition and gene expression.</a></h1><p>Seaweeds are an important component of human diets, especially in Asia and the Pacific islands, and have shown chemopreventive as well as anti-inflammatory properties. However, structural characterization and mechanistic insight of seaweed components responsible for their biological activities are lacking. We isolated cymopol and related natural products from the marine green alga Cymopolia barbata and demonstrated their function as activators of transcription factor Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response to increase the cellular antioxidant status. We probed the reactivity of the bioactivation product of cymopol, cymopol quinone, which was able to modify various cysteine residues of Nrf2's cytoplasmic repressor protein Keap1. The observed adducts are reflective of the polypharmacology at the level of natural product, due to multiple electrophilic centers, and at the amino  level of the cysteine-rich target protein Keap1. The non-polar C. barbata extract and its major active component cymopol, reduced inflammatory gene transcription in vitro in macrophages and mouse embryonic fibroblasts in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Cymopol-containing extracts attenuated neutrophil migration in a zebrafish tail wound model. RNA-seq analysis of colonic tissues of mice exposed to non-polar extract or cymopol showed an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory response, with more pronounced effects exhibited by the extract. Cymopolia extract reduced DSS-induced  as measured by fecal lipocalin concentration. RNA-seq showed that mucosal-associated bacterial composition and transcriptional profile in large intestines were beneficially altered to varying degrees in mice treated with either the extract or cymopol. We conclude that seaweed-derived compounds, especially cymopol, alter Nrf2-mediated host and microbial gene expression, thereby providing polypharmacological effects.Copyright © 2019.

They play an essential role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis by limiting microbial epithelium interactions and preventing unnecessary microbe-driven inflammation. Pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) belongs to Regenerating islet-derived III proteins family and is a C-type (Ca dependent) lectin. PAP protein plays a protective effect presenting anti-inflammatory properties able to reduce the severity of , preserving gut barrier and epithelial inflammation. Here, we sought to determine whether PAP delivered at intestinal lumen by recombinant Lactococcus lactis strain (LL-PAP) before and after chemically induced  is able to reduce the severity in two models of . After construction and characterization of our recombinant strains, we tested their effects in dinitro-benzenesulfonic- (DNBS) and Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)  model. After the DNBS challenge, mice treated with LL-PAP presented less severe  compared with PBS and LL-empty-treated mice groups. After the DSS challenge, no protective effects of LL-PAP could be detected. We determined that after 5 days administration, LL-PAP increase butyrate producer's bacteria, especially Eubacterium plexicaudatum. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that a treatment with LL-PAP shifts the microbiota preventing the severity of colon inflammation in DNBS  model. These protective roles of LL-PAP in DNBS  model might be through intestinal microbiota modulation.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the levels may be false negative or false positive in some situations.To evaluate the usefulness of immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of tissue calprotectin (T-CPT) in bowel mucosa in children with ulcerative  (UC). We focused at correlation of T-CPT with levels of F-CPT and endoscopic and microscopic disease activity at the time of diagnosis and tested whether T-CPT could serve as predictor of complicated course of the disease.Forty-nine children with newly diagnosed UC between 6/2010-1/2018 entered the study. Endoscopic activity was objectified using the Ulcerative  Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS), clinical activity by Pediatric Ulcerative  Activity Index (PUCAI) and microscopic activity by Geboes and Nancy score. The IHC staining for CPT antigen was performed on bioptic samples from 6 bowel segments and the number of CPT + cells were counted per 1HPF. During the minimal follow-up of 12 months we searched for presence of complications. As outcome for Cox regression model we used composite endpoints: A) Acute Severe , colectomy, anti-TNF treatment; B) systemic corticotherapy; C) systemic 5-aminosalicylic  therapy.Neither levels of T-CPT nor values of UCEIS, Geboes or Nancy score predicted the given complications. We found F-CPT levels (HR 2.42 and 2.52) and PUCAI > 40 points (HR 2.98) as predictors of time to endpoints B and C. Good correlation was found between T-CPT levels and Geboes score (k = 0.65) and Nancy score (k = 0.62) and modest with F-CPT (k = 0.44), UCEIS (k = 0.38) and PUCAI (k = 0.42).T-CPT correlated well with microscopic scores.

Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn's disease, the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic inflammatory enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and disease.We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile , lithocholic and deoxycholic . Physiologic levels of these bile  inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile  during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of deoxycholic  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS  was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn's disease.These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved microbiota structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile . Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn's disease, along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate disease. These findings provide insight into diet-induced remission of gastrointestinal disease and could help guide the rational design of more effective therapeutic diets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656564>Microscopic : diagnosis and management.</a></h1><p>Microscopic  (MC) is a common cause of chronic, non-bloody, watery diarrhoea in older patients.

This work illustrates that  is capable of enhancing the intestinal mucus layer and goblet cell function via upregulation of gene expression and autophagy signaling pathways, with a net increase in mucin production. Microbe-host interactions in the intestine occur along the mucus-covered epithelium. In the gastrointestinal tract, mucus is composed of glycan-covered proteins, or mucins, which are secreted by goblet cells to form a protective gel-like structure above the epithelium. Low levels of mucin or alterations in mucin glycans are associated with inflammation and  in mice and humans. Although current literature links microbes to the modulation of goblet cells and mucins, the molecular pathways involved are not yet fully understood. Using a combination of gnotobiotic mice and mucus-secreting cell lines, we have identified a human-derived microbe, , which adheres to intestinal mucus and secretes metabolites that upregulate the major mucin MUC2 and modulate goblet cell function. Unlike other  species,  does not extensively degrade mucin glycans and cannot grow on mucin alone. This work points to the potential of using  and similar mucin-friendly microbes as therapeutic agents for intestinal disorders with disruptions in the mucus barrier.Copyright © 2019 Engevik et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379610>Pinocembrin Protects Against Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Rats  by Ameliorating Inflammation, Improving Barrier Function and Modulating Gut Microbiota.</a></h1><p>Pinocembrin (PIN) is a natural flavonoid widely found in bee propolis with potent gastrointestinal protective effects.

While DSS-treated rats showed severe  clinical symptoms and histological changes (colonic pathological damages and intestinal goblet cells loss), pre-administration of PIN (5 and 10 mg/kg, ) for a week alleviated these symptoms. Pre-administration of PIN also suppressed the pro-inflammatory gene expressions and improved tight junction functions of colonic epithelial cells. Additionally, PIN administration reversed DSS-induced short chain fatty  loss, and improved the gut microbial diversity assessed by 16S rRNA phylogenetic sequencing.

Topical tacrolimus is effective and safe in patients with refractory UP. However, it is not clear how tacrolimus suppositories fit into in the treatment algorithm of UP.We performed a randomized controlled, double-blind study at 8 hospitals in The Netherlands and Belgium from 2014 through 2017. Eighty-five patients with refractory UP (65% women) were randomly assigned to groups given once daily tacrolimus suppositories (2mg, n=43) or beclomethasone (3mg, n=42) for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was clinical response (decrease in Mayo score of 3 or more). Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, endoscopic response and remission, adverse events and quality of life. Outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test.Proportions of patients with clinical responses were 63% in the tacrolimus group and 59% in the beclomethasone group (P=.812); proportions of patients in clinical remission were 46% and 38%, respectively (P=.638). Proportions of patients with an endoscopic response were 68% and 60% in the tacrolimus group and in the beclomethasone group (P=.636); proportions in endoscopic remission rates were 30% and 13%, respectively (P=.092) Median increases in the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score were 18.0 in the tacrolimus group and 20.5 in the beclomethasone group (P=.395). Adverse event rates did not differ significantly between groups.In a 4-week randomized controlled trial, tacrolimus and beclomethasone suppositories induce comparable clinical and endoscopic responses in patients with UP refractory to 5-ASA. There were no significant differences in adverse events rates. Tacrolimus and beclomethasone suppositories are therefore each safe and effective treatment options for 5-ASA refractory disease.

Patients having UC are prone to colorectal cancer and dysplastic polyps, and also have sporadic adenomas. Syringic  (SA) possesses many health benefits including antioxidant, anti-bacterial, and anti-cancer. This study was aimed to identify the effects of SA on UC, using a murine experimental model. Clinical symptoms and weight loss were significantly reduced in mice induced with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and treated with SA, compared to untreated mice. The effects of SA exhibited in DSS-induced mice were associated with significant decrease in the expressions levels of inflammatory mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF-α], interleukin [IL-1β and IL-6]), remarkable amelioration of colonic architectural disruption, and a significant reduction in the activity of colonic myeloperoxidase. To further confirm the anti-inflammatory property of SA, RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides. SA dose-dependently inhibited the cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. It also decreased the expressions of p65-NF-κB and IκB, thus reducing the activation and nuclear accumulation of p-STAT-3 . This prohibited the degradation of inhibitory protein, IκB, as well as inhibited the nuclear translocation of p65-NF-κB in colonic tissue. It was concluded that SA has a potential to limit inflammation via inhibiting the p65-NF-κB and STAT3 signaling; hence it can be used for therapeutic purposes.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443089>Evaluation of the effect of liposomes loaded with chlorogenic  in treatment of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced murine .</a></h1><p>Crohn's Disease (CD), one of the types of inflammatory bowel disease, poses a significant challenge to modern healthcare.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which release immunomodulatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have been suggested as an alternative therapeutic option for IBD treatment in veterinary medicine. Furthermore, although it is known that MSCs pre-treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines show enhanced anti-inflammatory properties via the secretion of soluble factors, the underlying mechanisms of IBD remain unclear. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the therapeutic effects and corresponding mechanisms of canine adipose tissue-derived (cAT)-MSCs stimulated with TNF-α in mouse models of IBD. Mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or dinitrobenzene sulfonic  (DNBS)-induced  were injected intraperitoneally with cAT-MSCs pre-treated with TNF-α.  severity was assessed and colon tissues were collected for histopathological, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry analysis. cAT-MSCs stimulated with TNF-α secreted higher concentrations of immunomodulatory factors such as TSG-6 and PGE2, which play a key role in inducing phenotypic alterations in macrophages. Consequently, TNF-α-pre-treated cAT-MSCs further regulated colonic inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-10, and ameliorated DSS- or DNBS-induced  in mice. Additionally, we demonstrated that M1 macrophages (F4/80/iNOS cells) were decreased in colon tissues from mice treated with TNF-α-pre-treated cAT-MSCs, whereas M2 macrophages (F4/80/CD206 cells) were increased.

Capryol 90 was found to be a successful, and even preferred, alternative to benzyl benzoate, which is commonly employed as the oil core of such nanocapsules.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182999>Protective Effect of Methane-Rich Saline on Acetic -Induced Ulcerative  via Blocking the TLR4/NF-B/MAPK Pathway and Promoting IL-10/JAK1/STAT3-Mediated Anti-inflammatory Response.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative  (UC) is an inflammation-related disease involved in uncontrolled inflammation and oxidative stress and is characterized by high recurrence and relapse risk. As a rising star in gas medicine, methane owns the properties of anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and antiapoptosis. Based on the possible mechanism, we aimed to investigate the effect of methane on UC. Methane-rich saline (MRS) was introduced here, and UC was induced by acetic . All the C57BL/6 mice were allocated into groups as follows: control group,  model group,  treated with salazosulfapyridine (SASP) group, and  treated with MRS (1 or 10 ml/kg) groups. Tissue damage, the degree of inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were evaluated in the study, as well as the TLR4/NF-B/MAPK and IL-10/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathways for further exploration of the potential mechanism. The results showed that MRS (1) alleviated tissue damage caused by acetic , (2) controlled acetic -induced inflammation, (3) inhibited acetic -caused oxidative stress, (4) reduced colonic cell apoptosis due to acetic , (5) suppressed the TLR-4/NF-B/MAPK signaling pathway, and (6) activated IL-10/JAK1/STAT3 anti-inflammatory response to improve the injury induced by acetic . We conclude that MRS has a protective effect on acetic -induced ulcerative  in mice via blocking the TLR4/NF-B/MAPK signaling pathway and promoting the IL-10/JAK1/STAT3-mediated anti-inflammatory response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31221091>Linear growth failure induced by systemic inflammation inhibiting IGF-1/IGFBP axis in rats with asymptomatic .</a></h1><p>Children in poor areas show significant growth retardation that does not improve with an adequate supply of energy and nutrients, which may be related to asymptomatic intestinal infection caused by poor sanitation. Our objective was to explore the mechanism of intestinal inflammation inhibiting growth in the setting of asymptomatic .Forty-eight 3-week-old Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: the control group,  group (with asymptomatic  induced by 2.5% trinitrobenzenesulphonic ) and pair-fed group (daily food intake matched to the pair in the  group). The linear growth was assessed, and the plasma levels of hormone and systemic cytokines were detected and compared by independent two-sample t-test or one-way ANOVA among groups.At d5, the increases in the body length of the control,  and pair-fed groups were 1.65 ± 0.34 cm, 1.10 ± 0.30 cm and 1.38 ± 0.26 cm, respectively, and the increase in the body length in the  group was significantly less than that in the control group (P < 0.05). There were significant differences in the levels of hormone and cytokines among three groups (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, rats in the  group exhibited linear growth failure, as well as higher expression of calprotectin, tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2, lower insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, and lower expression of nuclear factor kappa B in hepatocytes.In addition to undernutrition, the systemic inflammatory response caused by asymptomatic  may inhibit the linear growth of rats by its influence on the insulin-like growth factor/insulin-like growth factor binding protein axis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297055>Targeting the Eph/Ephrin System as Anti-Inflammatory Strategy in IBD.</a></h1><p>Besides their long-known critical role in embryonic growth and in cancer development and progression, erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma type B (EphB) receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin-B ligands are involved in the modulation of immune responses and in remodeling and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial layer. These processes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory-based disorders of the gut, like inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Accordingly, our aim was to investigate the role of the EphB/ephrin-B system in intestinal inflammation by assessing the local and systemic effects produced by its pharmacological manipulation in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)- (Th1-dependent model) and dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)- (innate response model) induced  in mice. To this purpose, we administered chimeric Fc-conjugated proteins, allegedly able to uni-directionally activate either forward (ephrin-B1-Fc) or reverse (EphB1-Fc) signaling, and the soluble monomeric EphB4 extracellular domain protein, that, simultaneously interfering with both signaling pathways, acts as EphB/ephrin-B antagonist.The blockade of the EphB/ephrin-B forward signaling by EphB4 and EphB1-Fc was ineffective against DSS-induced  while it evoked remarkable beneficial effects against TNBS : it counteracted all the evaluated inflammatory responses and the changes elicited on splenic T lymphocytes subpopulations, without preventing the appearance of a splice variant of ephrin-B2 gene elicited by the haptenating agent in the colon. Interestingly, EphB4, preferentially displacing EphB4/ephrin-B2 interaction over EphB1/ephrin-B1 binding, was able to promote Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) release by splenic mononuclear cells . On the whole, the collected results point to a potential role of the EphB/ephrin-B system as a pharmacological target in intestinal inflammatory disorders and suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of its blockade seemingly works through the modulation of immune responses, independent of the changes at the transcriptional and translational level of EphB4 and ephrin-B2 genes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31378906>Regulatory mechanism of mesalazine on TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway in mouse ulcerative  model.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanism of mesalazine (MSLZ) on microRNA-21, microRNA-31 and Toll-like receptor 4/myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (TLR4/MyD88)-dependent pathway in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)/ethanol-induced ulcerative  (UC) model in mice.The UC model was constructed by coloclysis of TNBS/ethanol in mice. 60 male mice were randomly assigned into control group, model group, MSLZ group and Azathioprine (AZA) group, with 15 mice in each. Corresponding drug or saline was i.g. injected in mice for consecutive 14 days. Pathological lesions in colon tissues were observed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining under the microscope. The expression levels of microRNA-21 and microRNA-31 in mouse colon tissues were determined by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). The mRNA and protein levels of relative genes in TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway in mouse colon tissues were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively.A mouse UC model was successfully constructed based on scores of DAI, colonic damage and pathological lesions under the microscope. MSLZ markedly improved clinical symptoms and mucosal healing. Meanwhile, the protective effect of MSLZ was similar or even stronger than that of AZA. The expression levels of microRNA-21 and microRNA-31 in mouse colon tissues in the model group were significantly higher than those of the control group (p<0.01). Compared with the model group, both MSLZ and AZA treatment could remarkably inhibit the expressions of microRNA-21 and microRNA-31 (p<0.01). The mRNA and protein levels of relative genes in TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway in mouse colon tissues were markedly upregulated in the model group when compared with those of the control group. The inhibitory effect of MSLZ on the expressions of upstream factors in TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway (including TLR4, MyD88, TRAF-6 and NF-κB) was slightly stronger than AZA, which was weaker in inhibiting downstream factors (including TNF-α and IL-1β). However, no significant difference in the inhibition of TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway was found between MSLZ and AZA (p>0.05).In the TNBS/ethanol-induced UC mouse model, MSLZ could inhibit the expressions of microRNA-21 and microRNA-31 in colon tissues. Furthermore, MSLZ also inhibited the release of inflammatory factors by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway in UC mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614142>Sofalcone, a gastroprotective drug, covalently binds to KEAP1 to activate Nrf2 resulting in anti-colitic activity.</a></h1><p>Sofalcone is a synthetic chalcone being used as a gastric mucosa protective agent in Japan. Sofalcone contains a 1,3-diaryl-2-propen-1-one moiety, which is a common chemical scaffold in naturally occurring chalcones. The α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group (Michael reaction acceptor) has electrophilic properties. We investigated the biochemical mechanisms by which sofalcone activated the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NF-E2) p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-heme oxygenase (HO)-1 pathway. Furthermore, we investigated whether the activation of this pathway was involved in sofalcone -mediated protective effects in an experimental  model. Sofalcone induced HO-1 protein expression, which was dependent on increased nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in human colon carcinoma cells. In addition, Sofalcone reacted with nucleophilic thiol compounds to form Michael adducts. A reduced form of sofalcone (SFCR) in which the Michael reaction acceptor was deactivated, did not exert biological or chemical activity. Biotin-tagged sofalcone bound to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), a cytosolic repressor of Nrf2. This binding was prevented by pretreatment with sofalcone and a thiol compound but not with SFCR. Furthermore, sofalcone treatment induced dissociation of the Nrf2-KEAP1 complex. Rectal administration of sofalcone alleviated colon damage and inflammation and increased colon nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and HO-1 levels in a dinitrobenzene sulfonic -induced rat  model. The protective effects of sofalcone against colon damage and inflammation were significantly inhibited by co-administration of an HO-1 inhibitor. In conclusion, sofalcone activated the Nrf2-HO-1 pathway by covalently binding to KEAP1 via Michael addition, and may confer anti-colitic effects by inducing Nrf2 activation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Leukocyte myeloperoxidase (MPO) produces the two-electron oxidant hypochlorous  (HOCl), damaging tissue and playing a role in cellular recruitment, thereby exacerbating gut injury. We tested whether the MPO-inhibitor, 4-Methoxy-TEMPO (MetT), ameliorates experimental IBD.  was induced in C57BL/6 mice by 3% w/v dextran-sodium-sulfate (DSS) in drinking water ad libitum over 9-days with MetT (15 mg/kg; via i. p. injection) or vehicle control (10% v/v DMSO+90% v/v phosphate buffered saline) administered twice daily during DSS challenge. MetT attenuated body-weight loss (50%, p < 0.05, n = 6), improved clinical score (53%, p < 0.05, n = 6) and inhibited serum lipid peroxidation. Histopathological damage decreased markedly in MetT-treated mice, as judged by maintenance of crypt integrity, goblet cell density and decreased cellular infiltrate. Colonic Ly6C, MPO-labelled cells and 3-chlorotyrosine (3-Cl-Tyr) decreased in MetT-treated mice, although biomarkers for nitrosative stress (3-nitro-tyrosine-tyrosine; 3-NO-Tyr) and low-molecular weight thiol damage (assessed as glutathione sulfonamide; GSA) were unchanged. Interestingly, MetT did not significantly impact colonic IL-10 and IL-6 levels, suggesting a non-immunomodulatory pathway. Overall, MetT ameliorated the severity of experimental IBD, likely via a mechanism involving the modulation of MPO-mediated damage.Copyright © 2019.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which TOE affects dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced  remain unclear. After DSS-induced  were treated with different concentrations of TOE for 8 days, the bodyweight, disease activity index (DAI), colon lengths and pathological scoring were assessed, and histopathological examination was confirmed by HE staining. Furthermore, a transcriptome sequencing was performed by using the colon tissues between TOE and DSS groups, and the differentially expressed genes were conducted for the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and were validated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. In addition, a 16S rDNA sequencing was carried out to distinguish the differential gut microbiota by using the mouse faecal samples between TOE and DSS groups. We found that TOE attenuated the clinical symptoms, lowered the inflammatory scoring and inhibited the secretion of proinflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in DSS-induced . KEGG and GSEA analysis demonstrated that fatty  degradation and cytokine-receptor signalling were predominantly enriched in TOE-treated  as compared with the DSS group. Further investigations revealed that TOE increased the expression levels of Adh5, Aldh3a2 and Acox3, but decreased those of CCL20, CCR6 and CXCL1/5 in DSS-induced , where TOE also induced the enrichment of S24-7 and adlercreutzia, but decreased the amount of anaerostipes, enterococcus, enterobacteriaceae and peptostreptococcaceae. In conclusion, TOE ameliorated DSS-induced  by regulating fatty  degradation and microbial dysbiosis.© 2019 The Authors.

This role has largely been attributed to nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) signaling since the latter is considered a major inducer of RICK activation. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanisms accounting for RICK-mediated inhibition of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In an initial series of studies focused on trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)- and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)- we showed that down-regulation of intestinal RICK expression in NOD2-intact mice by intra-rectal administration of a plasmid expressing RICK-specific siRNA was accompanied by down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in the colon and protection of the mice from experimental . Somewhat surprisingly, intra-rectal administration of RICK-siRNA also inhibited TNBS- and DSS- in NOD2-deficient and in NOD1/NOD2-double deficient mice. In complementary studies of humans with IBD we found that expression of RICK, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (cIAP2) and downstream signaling partners were markedly increased in inflamed tissue of IBD compared to controls without marked elevations of NOD1 or NOD2 expression. In addition, the increase in RICK expression correlated with disease activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. These studies thus suggest that NOD1- or NOD2-independenent activation of RICK plays a major role in both murine experimental  and human IBD.© The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2019.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of grape peel powder (GPP) and its bioactive rich-fractions on the barrier function and colonic injury in a model of  induced by 2,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS). Wistar rats received diets supplemented with either GPP (8%), extractable polyphenols (EP), non-extractable polyphenols-rich fraction (NEP-F), or polyphenols-poor, fiber-rich fraction (F) from grapes at amounts equivalent to the GPP group during 15 days before and for 7 days after  induction. NEP-F has decreased the extension of colonic lesion but the other grape peel bioactive fractions did not protect against macroscopic or microscopic colonic damage, EP diet increased macroscopic colonic damage. GPP, EP, and NEP-F reduced claudin-2 mRNA expression, whereas GPP and F fraction increased occludin and ZO-1 mRNA expression. All experimental diets reduced the -triggered increase of MMP-9 mRNA expression.  reduced by 30% the production of cecal short-chain fatty  (SCFA). GPP and NEP-F completely protected against this effect, whereas F fraction was ineffective. Only GPP and NEP-F were able to decrease the upregulation of GRP94 mRNA triggered by .

Recent evidence suggests that intestinal mucosal barrier damage and intestinal dysbiosis occur in mice with hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl4 or bile duct ligation. Another study showed that ursolic  (UA) attenuates experimental  via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of UA on the intestinal mucosal barrier in CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats and identify its associated mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following 3 groups ( = 10/group): the control, CCl4 model and UA treatment groups. Rats were sacrificed at 72 h after the hepatic fibrosis model was established and assessed for liver fibrosis, intestinal injury, enterocyte apoptosis, bacterial translocation, system inflammation, intestinal oxidative stress, and tight junction protein and NOX protein expression. The results demonstrated that UA attenuated the following: (i) liver and intestinal pathological injury; (ii) cleaved caspase-3 expression in the ileal epithelial cells; (iii) serum lipopolysaccharide and procalcitonin levels; (iv) intestinal malondialdehyde levels; and (v) the expression of the NOX protein components NOX2 and P67phox in ileal tissues. Furthermore, our results suggested that UA improved intestinal dysbiosis and the expression of the tight junction proteins Claudin 1 and Occludin in the ileum of rats. These results indicate that UA has protective effects on the intestinal mucosal barrier in rats with CCl4-induced liver fibrosis by inhibiting intestinal NOX-mediated oxidative stress. Our findings may provide a basis for further clinical studies of UA as a novel and adjuvant treatment to cure liver fibrosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31215733>Retrospective evaluation of the association between admission blood glucose and l-lactate concentrations in ponies and horses with gastrointestinal disease (2008-2016): 545 cases.</a></h1><p>A recent study described increased l-lactate concentrations in ponies with gastrointestinal disease compared to horses, but blood glucose (BG) concentrations were not considered. The study tested the hypothesis that BG and l-lactate concentrations are correlated in horses and ponies with gastrointestinal disease and that BG concentrations, not equid type (pony vs horse), are an independent predictor of L-lactate concentrations. It was further hypothesized that equid type was an independent predictor of BG concentrations.Retrospective study 2008-2016.University teaching hospital.Admission data from 545 animals (384 horses and 161 ponies) with gastrointestinal disease.None.Data collected included signalment, clinicopathological findings on admission, and nature and location of the gastrointestinal lesion (strangulating vs non-strangulating and large vs small intestinal lesion). The association between admission blood l-lactate concentrations, equid type (pony or horse) and BG concentrations was investigated in a multivariable model. Admission l-lactate and BG concentrations were strongly correlated (n = 522; r = 0.63; P < 0.001). Ponies had significantly higher l-lactate (2.7 mmol/L (0.5-18.0 mmol/L) vs 1.4 mmol/L (0.3-19 mmol/L); P < 0.001) and BG concentrations than horses (8.4 mmol/L (4.2-24.4 mmol/L); 151 mg/dL (76-439 mg/dL) vs 6.9 mmol/L (3.4-26.8 mmol/L); 124 mg/dL (61-482 mg/dL); P < 0.001). In the multivariable analysis, l-lactate concentrations were significantly and positively associated with admission BG concentrations in all animals and also with equid type. For each millimole per liter (18 mg/dL) increase in BG, l-lactate concentrations increased by 7.9% (5.9, 9.9); P < 0.001. In comparison to ponies, l-lactate concentrations were decreased by 27.7% (37.4, 16.5); P < 0.001 in horses. Admission BG concentrations were significantly and positively associated with l-lactate concentrations in all animals. For each millimole per liter increase in l-lactate concentration, BG concentration increased by 6.2% (4.7, 7.6; P < 0.001). Admission BG concentrations were not associated with equid type.Admission BG concentrations and equid type are independent predictors of blood l-lactate concentrations in equids with gastrointestinal disease, but their relationship requires further investigation.© Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406919>Causation of human ulcerative : A lead from an animal model that mirrors human disease.</a></h1><p>Most models of experimental  do not replicate human ulcerative  and do not help in defining the causation of human ulcerative .

To achieve this objective, overlapping actions of complex cellular processes, such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation, are required. These events are longitudinally and tightly controlled by numerous factors including a wide range of distinct regulatory proteins. However, the sequence of events associated with colon mucosal repair after  and the evolution of the luminal content characteristics during this process have been little studied.To document the evolution of colon mucosal characteristics during mucosal healing using a mouse model with chemically-induced .C57BL/6 male mice were given 3.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for 5 d. They were euthanized 2 (day 7), 5 (day 10), 8 (day 13), and 23 (day 28) d after DSS removal. The colonic luminal environment and epithelial repair processes during the inflammatory flare and  resolution were analyzed with reference to a non-DSS treated control group, euthanized at day 0. Epithelial repair events were assessed histo-morphologically in combination with functional permeability tests, expression of key inflammatory and repairing factors, and evaluation of colon mucosa-adherent microbiota composition by 16S rRNA sequencing.The maximal intensity of  was concomitant with maximal alterations of intestinal barrier function and histological damage associated with goblet cell depletion in colon mucosa. It was recorded 2 d after termination of the DSS-treatment, followed by a progressive return to values similar to those of control mice. Although signs of  were severe (inflammatory cell infiltrate, crypt disarray, increased permeability) and associated with colonic luminal alterations (hyperosmolarity, dysbiosis, decrease in short-chain fatty  content), epithelial healing processes were launched early during the inflammatory flare with increased gene expression of certain key epithelial repair modulators, including transforming growth factor-β, interleukin (Il)-15, Il-22, Il-33, and serum amyloid A. Whereas signs of inflammation progressively diminished, luminal colonic environment alterations and microscopic abnormalities of colon mucosa persisted long after  induction.This study shows that colon repair can be initiated in the context of inflamed mucosa associated with alterations of the luminal environment and highlights the longitudinal involvement of key modulators.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351880>AGA Technical Review on the Evaluation of Functional Diarrhea and Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Adults (IBS-D).</a></h1><p>The evaluation of patients with chronic watery diarrhea represents a diagnostic challenge for clinicians because organic causes, including inflammatory bowel disease, microscopic , and chronic infection, must be differentiated from functional diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available evidence on the usefulness of diagnostic tests in such patients.We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE via OVID, from 1978 until April 2017. We included diagnostic test accuracy studies reporting on the use of fecal and blood tests for the evaluation of adult patients with functional diarrhea, including irritable bowel syndrome. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using a modified version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies II, and the certainty in the evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. We calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity, and the proportion of patients with true and false positive and negative results. We evaluated the following tests: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, fecal lactoferrin, fecal calprotectin, serologic tests for celiac disease, tests for bile  diarrhea, the commercially available version of anti-cytolethal distending toxin B and anti-vinculin antibodies, and tests for Giardia infection. We did not evaluate breath tests for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, as they are not part of a standard diarrhea workup.Thirty-eight studies proved eligible to evaluate 1 or more of these tests. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were similar at discriminating organic from functional disease, with sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of 0.54-0.78 and 0.46-0.95 for erythrocyte sedimentation rate and 0.73 and 0.78 for C-reactive protein. Among fecal tests, fecal calprotectin in a range of 50-60 μg/g (pooled sensitivity 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.86; pooled specificity 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78-0.92) and fecal lactoferrin in a range of 4.0-7.25 μg/g (pooled sensitivity 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84; pooled specificity 0.93; 95%CI 0.63-0.99) presented the lowest proportion of false-negative results (low certainty in the evidence). Among tests for celiac disease, IgA tissue transglutaminase presented the best diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity range, 0.79-0.99; specificity range, 0.90-0.99) with moderate certainty in the evidence. Among tests for bile  diarrhea, the selenium homotaurocholic  test performed better than serum fibroblast growth factor 19 and 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, but is not available in the United States. There was insufficient evidence to recommend serologic tests for irritable bowel syndrome at this time. There are several good diagnostic tests for Giardia infection.Moderate to low certainty in the evidence indicates that available fecal and blood tests may play a role in the diagnostic workup of adult patients with functional diarrhea. At the moment, no tests are available to reliably rule in irritable bowel syndrome.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It is not clear how inhibitors of cytokines, such as antagonists of tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF), affect the intestinal microbiome. We investigated the effects of anti-TNF agents on gut microbe community structure and function in a longitudinal 2-step study of patients with IBD. We correlated our findings with outcomes of treatment and investigated patterns of metabolites in fecal samples before and after anti-TNF therapy.We performed a prospective study of 2 cohorts of patients in Germany; the discovery cohort comprised 12 patients with IBD, 17 patients with rheumatic disease, and 19 healthy individuals (controls); fecal samples were collected at baseline and 2, 6, and 30 weeks after induction of anti-TNF therapy. The validation cohort comprised 23 patients with IBD treated with anti-TNF or vedolizumab (anti-α4β7 integrin) and 99 healthy controls; fecal samples were collected at baseline and at weeks 2, 6, and 14. Fecal microbiota were analyzed by V3-V4 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Clinical response and remission were determined by clinical disease activity scores. Metabolic network reconstruction and associated fecal metabolite level inference was performed in silico using the AGORA (Assembly of Gut Organisms through Reconstruction and Analysis) resource. Metabolomic analyses of fecal samples from a subset of patients were performed to validate metabolites associated with treatment outcomes.Anti-TNF therapy shifted the diversity of fecal microbiota in patients with IBD, but not with rheumatic disease, toward that of controls. Across timepoints, diversity indices did not vary significantly between patients with IBD who did or did not achieve clinical remission after therapy. In contrast, in silico modeling of metabolic interactions between gut microbes found metabolite exchange to be significantly reduced at baseline in fecal samples from patients with IBD and to be associated with later clinical remission. Predicted levels of butyrate and substrates involved in butyrate synthesis (ethanol or acetaldehyde) were significantly associated with clinical remission following anti-TNF therapy, verified by fecal metabolomic analyses.Metabolic network reconstruction and assessment of metabolic profiles of fecal samples might be used to identify patients with IBD likely to achieve clinical remission following anti-TNF therapy and increase our understanding of the heterogeneity of IBD.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Accumulating data implicate a potential role of disturbed tryptophan metabolism in IBD. Kynurenic  (KYNA), a derivative of tryptophan (TRP) along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, displays cytoprotective and immunomodulating properties, whereas 3-OH-KYN is a cytotoxic compound, generating free radicals.The expression of lymphocytic mRNA encoding enzymes synthesizing KYNA (KAT I-III) and serum levels of TRP and its metabolites were evaluated in 55 patients with IBD, during remission or relapse [27 patients with ulcerative  (UC) and 28 patients with Crohn's disease (CD)] and in 50 control individuals.The increased expression of KAT1 and KAT3 mRNA characterized the entire cohorts of patients with UC and CD, as well as relapse-remission subsets. Expression of KAT2 mRNA was enhanced in patients with UC and in patients with CD in remission. In the entire cohorts of UC or CD, TRP levels were lower, whereas KYN, KYNA and 3-OH-KYN were not altered. When analysed in subsets of patients with UC and CD (active phase-remission), KYNA level was significantly lower during remission than relapse, yet not  control. Functionally, in the whole groups of patients with UC or CD, the TRP/KYN ratio has been lower than control, whereas KYN/KYNA and KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratios were not altered. The ratio KYN/3-OH-KYN increased approximately two-fold among all patients with CD; furthermore, patients with CD with relapse, manifested a significantly higher KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratio than patients in remission.The presented data indicate that IBD is associated with an enhanced expression of genes encoding KYNA biosynthetic enzymes in lymphocytes; however, additional mechanisms appear to influence KYNA levels. Higher metabolic conversion of serum TRP in IBD seems to be followed by the functional shift of KYN pathway towards the arm producing KYNA during exacerbation. We propose that KYNA, possibly  interaction with aryl hydrocarbon receptor or G-protein-coupled orphan receptor 35, may serve as a counter-regulatory mechanism, decreasing cytotoxicity and inflammation in IBD. Further longitudinal studies evaluating the individual dynamics of TRP and KYN pathway in patients with IBD, as well as the nature of precise mechanisms regulating KYNA synthesis, should be helpful in better understanding the processes underlying the observed changes.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102124>Autotaxin-Lysophosphatidic  Axis Blockade Improves Inflammation by Regulating Th17 Cell Differentiation in DSS-Induced Chronic  Mice.</a></h1><p>Autotaxin-lysophosphatidic  (ATX-LPA) axis is closely associated with several inflammation-related diseases. In the colonic mucosa of patients with chronic ulcerative  (UC), the expression of ATX and the percentage of Th17 cells are found to increase. However, it is unclear whether ATX-LPA axis affects the differentiation of Th17 cells in chronic UC. To investigate whether ATX-LPA axis contributes to Th17 cell differentiation, a mouse model of chronic UC was established by drinking water with DSS at intervals. ATX inhibitor was used as an intervention. The disease active index (DAI), colonic weight to length ratio, colon length, colon histopathology, and MAdCAM-1 were observed. Additionally, the expression of ATX, LPA receptor, CD34, IL-17A, IL-21, IL-6, ROR-γt, STAT3 in colonic tissue, and the percentage of Th17 cells in spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were measured using different methods. ATX blockade was able to relieve symptoms and inflammatory response of DSS-induced chronic . The DAI and colonic weight to length ratio were apparently decreased, while the colon length was increased. The pathological damage and  severity were lighter in the inhibitor group than that in the DSS group. Inhibiting ATX reduced the expression of ATX, LPA receptor, and CD34 and also decreased the percentages of Th17 cells in spleens and MLNs and the expressions of IL-17A and IL-21, as well as the factors in Th17 cell signaling pathway including IL-6, ROR-γt, and STAT3 in colonic tissue. ATX-LPA axis blockade could alleviate inflammation by suppressing Th17 cell differentiation in chronic UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31212833>Contribution of the Gut Microbiota in P28GST-Mediated Anti-Inflammatory Effects: Experimental and Clinical Insights.</a></h1><p>An original immuno-regulatory strategy against inflammatory bowel diseases based on the use of 28 kDa glutathione S-transferase (P28GST), a unique schistosome protein, was recently proposed. Improvement of intestinal inflammation occurs through restoration of the immunological balance between pro-inflammatory T-helper 1 (Th1) responses and both T-helper 2 (Th2) and regulatory responses. However, detailed mechanisms explaining how P28GST prevents  and promotes gut homeostasis remain unknown. Considering the complex interplay between the adaptive and innate immune system and the intestinal microbiota, we raised the question of the possible role of the microbial ecosystem in the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the helminth-derived P28GST protein. We first analyzed, by 16S rRNA sequencing, the bacterial profiles of mice fecal microbiota at several time points of the P28GST-immunomodulation period prior to trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-. The influence of gut microbiota in the P28GST-mediated anti-inflammatory effects was then assessed by fecal microbiota transplantation experiments from P28GST-immunized mice to either conventional or microbiota depleted naïve recipient mice. Finally, the experimental data were supplemented by the temporal fecal microbiota compositions of P28GST-treated Crohn's disease patients from a pilot clinical study (). The P28GST administration slightly modulated the diversity and composition of mouse fecal microbiota while it significantly reduced experimental  in mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation experiments failed to restore the P28GST-induced anti-inflammatory effects. In Crohn's disease patients, P28GST also induced slight changes in their overall fecal bacterial composition. Collectively, these results provide key elements in both the anti-inflammatory mechanisms and the safe therapeutic use of immunomodulation with such promising helminth-derived molecules.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31331350>Clinical burden of illness in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) and associated comorbidities - a retrospective study of German health insurance claims data.</a></h1><p>Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which, when poorly-managed, is associated with clinical features including deficient growth, microcephaly, seizures, and intellectual impairment. The management of PKU should start as soon as possible after diagnosis to prevent irreversible damage and be maintained throughout life. The aim of this study was to assess the burden of illness in PKU patients in general and in PKU patients born before and after the introduction of newborn screening in Germany.This retrospective matched cohort analysis used the Institut für angewandte Gesundheitsforschung Berlin (InGef) research database containing anonymized healthcare claims of approximately 4 million covered lives. PKU patients were compared with matched controls from the general population within the same database (1:10 ratio via direct, exact matching on age and gender without replacement). PKU patients were included if they were aged ≥18 years on 01/01/15 and were continuously enrolled from 01/01/10 to 31/12/15. The 50 most commonly reported comorbidities and 50 most commonly prescribed medications in the PKU population were analyzed. Differences between groups were tested using 95% confidence interval (CI) of prevalence ratio (PR) values.The analysis included 377 adult PKU patients (< 5 of which were receiving sapropterin dihydrochloride) and 3,770 matched controls. Of the 50 most common comorbidities in the PKU population, those with a statistically significant PR > 1.5 vs controls included major depressive disorders (PR = 2.3), chronic ischemic heart disease (PR = 1.7), asthma (PR = 1.7), dizziness and giddiness (PR = 1.8), unspecified diabetes mellitus (PR = 1.7), infectious gastroenteritis and  (PR = 1.7), and reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorders (PR = 1.6). The most commonly prescribed Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) subcodes among PKU patients (vs the control population) are for systemic antibacterials (34.7% vs 32.8%), anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic (29.4% vs 27.5%), renin-angiotensin agents (30.0% vs 27.0%), -related disorders (29.4% vs 20.2%), and beta-blockers (24.9% vs 19.9%).The overall clinical burden on patients with PKU is exacerbated by a significantly higher risk of numerous comorbidities and hence, prescribing of the requisite medication, both for recognized (e.g. major depressive disorders) and more unexpected comorbidities (e.g. ischemic heart disease).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337090>Nanogels of Succinylated Glycol Chitosan-Succinyl Prednisolone Conjugate: Preparation, In Vitro Characteristics and Therapeutic Potential.</a></h1><p>A novel anionic nanogel system was prepared using succinylated glycol chitosan-succinyl prednisolone conjugate (S-GCh-SP). The nanogel, named NG(S), was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. S-GCh-SP formed a nanogel via the aggregation of hydrophobic prednisolone (PD) moieties and the introduced succinyl groups contributed to the negative surface charge of the nanogel. The resultant NG(S) had a PD content of 13.7% (/), was ca. 400 nm in size and had a ζ-potential of -28 mV. NG(S) released PD very slowly at gastric pH and faster but gradually at small intestinal pH. Although NG(S) was easily taken up by the macrophage-like cell line Raw 264.7, it did not decrease cell viability, suggesting that the toxicity of the nanogel was very low. The in vivo evaluation was performed using rats with trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced . NG(S) and PD alone were not very effective at 5 mg PD eq./kg. However, NG(S) at 10 mg PD eq./kg markedly suppressed colonic damage, whereas PD alone did not. Furthermore, thymus atrophy was less with NG(S) than with PD alone. These results demonstrated that NG(S) is very safe, promotes drug effectiveness and has low toxicity.

A Review.</a></h1><p>Chronic inflammation takes part in the pathogenesis of some malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract including colorectal (CRC), gastric, and esophageal cancers. The use of ω3 polyunsaturated fatty  (ω3-PUFA) supplements for chemoprevention or adjuvant therapy of gastrointestinal cancers is being investigated in recent years. Most evidence has been reported in CRC, although their protective role has also been reported for -induced gastric cancer or Barrett's esophagus-derived adenocarcinoma. Studies based on ω3-PUFA supplementation in animal models of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and CRC revealed positive effects on cancer prevention, reducing the number and size of tumors, down-regulating arachidonic -derived eicosanoids, upregulating anti-oxidant enzymes, and reducing lipid peroxidation, whereas contradictory results have been found in induced  and -associated cancer. Beneficial effects have also been found in FAP and ulcerative  patients. Of special interest is their positive effect as adjuvants on radio- and chemo-sensitivity, specificity, and prevention of treatment complications. Some controversial results obtained in CRC might be justified by different dietary sources, extraction and preparation procedures of ω3-PUFAs, difficulties on filling out food questionnaires, daily dose and type of PUFAs, adenoma subtype, location of CRC, sex differences, and genetic factors. Studies using animal models of inflammatory bowel disease have confirmed that exogenous administration of active metabolites derived from PUFAs called pro-resolving mediators like lipoxin A4, arachidonic -derived, resolvins derived from eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosahexaenoic (DHA), and docosapentaenoic (DPA)  as well as maresin 1 and protectins DHA- and DPA-derived improve disease and inflammatory outcomes without causing immunosuppression or other side effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31100679>Extract of Ilex rotunda Thunb alleviates experimental -associated cancer via suppressing inflammation-induced miR-31-5p/YAP overexpression.</a></h1><p>Ilex rotunda Thunb is a traditional medicine used in China treating  clinically. Triterpenoids is one of its main components. However, the detailed pharmacological activity and the component responsible for its clinical effects are still elusive.To test the in vivo -associated cancer (CAC) preventive effect of the water fraction extracted from the roots of I. rotunda, and to evaluate its microRNA (miRNA)-related mechanism.Male or female C57BL/6 mice (12 weeks of age) were used to construct the azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced CAC. 12.5 mg/kg and 25.0 mg/kg of the standardized water extract of I. rotunda (WIR), being equal to 4.29 and 8.58 g of the raw medicine respectively, were adopted to treat the AOM/DSS-induced CAC from the fourth week and continued for 5 weeks. Mice were killed two weeks after the end of the last round of DSS by cervical dislocation.The chemical analysis of WIR revealed the presence of 21 compounds. The syringing and caffeic  (1-hydroxyl-4-O-β-D-glucopyranosylprenyl)-ester are the main components of WIR, counting for 8.27% and 5.71% of the water extract respectively. The levels of miR-31-5p were up-regulated in both thp1 and Caco2 cells (p < 0.05) stimulated by either IL-6 or TNF-α, and WIR could restore miR-31-5p levels in the IL-6/TNF-α-stimulated thp-1 and Caco2 cells. Furthermore, WIR decreased TNF-α and IL-6 levels in PMA-differentiated thp-1 cells stimulated by LPS via NF-κB pathway (p < 0.05), suggesting that WIR could restore miR-31-5p expression via down-regulating IL-6 and TNF-α levels. In vivo study showed that oral administration of WIR (25 mg/kg) produced a significant inhibition on the atypical hyperplasia, as well as the release and the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in the colon tissue. The in vivo transcription of other pro-inflammatory mediators such as iNOS, IL-11, and IL-17A were also attenuated by WIR administration (25 mg/kg, p < 0.05). Meanwhile, WIR (25 mg/kg) restored the miR-31-5p level which was up-regulated in the CAC model group, and ectopic expressions of the miR-31-5p down-stream LATS2 and YAP genes in the hippo pathway were also modulated by the WIR (25 mg/kg) treatment.The present study suggests that WIR exerts intestinal anti-inflammatory and CAC preventive effects in an experimental CAC mouse model. The CAC preventive effect can be attributed to the suppression of hippo pathway activated by the inflammatory cytokines, indicating that WIR can be potentially used as an herbal product for CAC prevention. Therefore, there is an emergent need for further evaluation of the main components in WIR to determine the definite bioactive component responsible for the CAC preventive activity.Copyright © 2019.

Hence, endeavors to improve the inflammatory pathology by manipulating gut microbiota are ongoing. Daphnetin (DAPH) is a coumarin derivative extracted from  with anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory properties that has been widely used in treating inflammatory disorders. Herein, we showed that DAPH remarkably alleviated experimental  by reducing colonic inflammation, improving colonic integrity, and reestablishing immune and metabolic homeostasis in the inflicted intestines. Our analysis showed that DAPH modified the composition of gut microbiota and altered the metabolic profiles in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. In particular, this agent significantly elevated the abundance of short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing gut microbiota, causatively related with the enhanced development of T cells and the reduced proinflammatory T17 cell differentiation. More critically, the protective effect of DAPH was shown to be transmissible among colitic mice through cohousing or fecal microbiota transplantation, further substantiating the importance of SCFA-producing gut microbiota in DAPH action. We thus for the first time reveal the potential of DAPH in resetting the gut microbiome and reestablishing immune homeostasis in colitic mice, which may have clinical implications for treating IBD.-Ji, J., Ge, X., Chen, Y., Zhu, B., Wu, Q., Zhang, J., Shan, J., Cheng, H., Shi, L.

But global MS-based profiling of the bile  (BAs) submetabolome is still a challenging task. Particularly for unconjugated BAs, the collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragment ions showed low ion intensities which were insufficient for analysis. This study is aimed at the development of an anion attachment MS-based approach for pseudotargeted profiling of the BAs submetabolome. We demonstrated that anion attachment MS with the combination use of ammonia fluoride (NHF) and formate could provide stable anionic adduct ([M + HCOO]) with good MS responses for unconjugated BAs. A mechanistic study revealed that the underlying rationale is due to the NHF-induced approximate matching of attractions between BAs and anion for the 24-carboxyl hydrogen. This 24-carboxyl hydrogen regioselectivity is useful to screen for potential unconjugated BAs from the biological matrix. The stability and regioselectivity of anion attachment allowed the establishment of SRM transitions for unconjugated BAs for the first time. To profile conjugated BAs that come from the conjugation of glycine or taurine at 24-carboxyl hydrogen, specific precursor/fragment ion transitions were used for the detection. Finally, SRM-based UPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the pseudotargeted profiling of the BAs submetabolome with good linearity (r > 0.995) and high sensitivity (0.20-1.37 ng mL for LLOQ). With this method, a total of 83 BAs, covering 45 unconjugated BAs and 38 conjugated BAs, were successfully determined in different biosamples from experimental  mice. The BAs metabolism homeostasis was disrupted by , characterized by the decreased BAs levels in serum and excessive BAs accumuation in the gall bladder and colon. Overall, the present anion attachment MS-based approach is sufficiently sensitive and robust to comprehensively measure various BAs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study is to investigate the function of SMA/CORM-2 on colorectal cancer proliferation and metastasis. CCK-8 experiment is used to clarify the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of SMA/CORM-2 and to detect cell proliferation. Transwell assay coated with or without matrigel was to detect cell invasion and migration. Western blot was used to detect β-catenin, AKT, p-AKT, VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins. At last, nude mice xenograft was used to further investigate the anti-tumor effect of SMA/CORM-2 in vivo. After SW480 and C26 cells were treated with 0.5 mg/ml SMA/CORM-2, CRC cells proliferation, migration and invasion were inhibited. In vivo, SMA/CORM-2 treatment remarkably suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in nude mice. Furthermore, the expression of β-catenin, p-AKT, VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins could be down-regulated after SMA/CORM-2 treatment.

A third of the patients are either misdiagnosed or a proper diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative  (UC) cannot be made. We need new biomarkers, so that we can offer patients the best treatment and keep the disease in an inactive state for as long as possible. Alterations in metabolic profiles have been incriminated in the pathophysiology of IBD. The aim of the present study was to identify molecules that could serve as biomarkers for a positive diagnosis of IBD as well as to discriminate UC from colonic CD. Twenty-two patients with active colonic IBD (UC = 17, CD = 5) and 24 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Plasma lipid and metabolic profiles were quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. Univariate and multivariate statistical tests were employed. Six lipid species and seven metabolites were significantly altered in IBD compared to healthy controls, with the majority belonging to glycerophospholipid, linoleic , and sphingolipid metabolisms. Five lipid species and only one metabolite were significantly increased in UC compared to CD. This preliminary study suggests that lipid and metabolic profiling of serum can become diagnostic tools for IBD.

It has been reported that berberine could protect mice from ulcerative , but the mechanism remains unclear. The current study's aim was to determine the potential mechanism by which berberine exhibits its anti-inflammatory function. Mice with  induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) were administered with berberine at 50 mg/kg by gavage. Berberine significantly increased the proportion of regulatory T cells (Treg cells). The targeted metabolomics analysis was then performed to find that glutamine and glutamate metabolism played an important role in the process of regulating immune response. mTORC1 pathway was reported to closely relate with glutamine metabolism. As a result, the relative expression levels of downstream effector genes of mTORC were further determined, and data obtained showed that berberine could significantly increase the relative expression levels of S6K1 and 4EBP1. In addition, rapamycin was used to inhibit mTORC1 signaling, and it was found that colon length, disease associated index (DAI), and proportion of Treg cells of mice in the rapamycin-DSS group were not different from those of mice in the rapamycin/berberine-DSS group. Together, these results suggest that berberine exhibits significant protective effects against DSS  by activating the mTORC1 pathway to increase the proportion of Treg cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31242961>G protein-coupled receptor 40 activation ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium-induced  in mice via the upregulation of glucagon-likepeptide-2.</a></h1><p>G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 40 is a receptor for long-chain free fatty  that enhances glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-2 production in intestinal L-cells. GLP-2 and its analogs have reported to increase remission rates in patients with Crohn's disease and improve experimental  in rodents. In the present study, we investigated the ameliorative effect of GPR40 activation in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine  model using a specific GPR40 agonist, AS2034178. The daily administration of AS2034178 attenuated DSS-induced increases in the disease activity index, the shortening of the colon length, and the histological colonic injury, and increased the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and expression of inflammatory cytokines, in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were abolished by treatment with DC260126, a GPR40 antagonist, or GLP-2 (3-33), a GLP-2 antagonist. GPR40 was expressed in the colonic mucosa, which was colocalized with proglucagon, a precursor of GLP-2. AS2034178 significantly increased the amount of GLP-2 in the colonic tissue, which was abolished by DC260126 but not GLP-2 (3-33). Furthermore, AS2034178 significantly promoted the healing of DSS-induced . These findings suggest that GPR40 activation ameliorates DSS-induced  in mice by enhancing GLP-2 production. Thus, GPR40 is a potential target for the treatment of IBD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Data on the effects of continuing 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) treatment in patients who commence on biologics as maintenance treatment remain scarce. We evaluated IBD patient outcomes after continuation/discontinuation of 5-ASA when biologics were administered as maintenance treatment.We retrospectively reviewed the clinical, laboratory, and imaging data of patients diagnosed with IBD (ulcerative  (UC), 763; Crohn's disease (CD), 537) in the Gil Medical Center (GMC) from February 2005 to June 2018. We divided patients administered with biologics as maintenance treatment into those who did and did not continue on 5-ASA and compared the efficacies of the two treatment options using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models.Of 1300 total IBD patients, 128 (UC, 63; CD, 65) were prescribed biologics as induction and maintenance treatments. The median follow-up period was 109.5 weeks. All cases were divided into those who did or did not combine 5-ASA with biologics as maintenance treatments. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the event-free survival (exacerbation of disease activity) of UC patients treated with biologics and 5-ASA (n = 42) was not significantly lower than that of those taking biologics alone (n = 21) (log rank test, P = 0.68). The same was true of CD patients (n = 42, biologics and 5-ASA; n = 23, biologics only) (log rank test, P = 0.87).Continuation of 5-ASA after initiation of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha agents did not improve prognosis in Korean IBD patients compared with that of those who discontinued 5-ASA during maintenance treatment, particularly in patients who experienced more than two disease aggravations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570593>RORα is crucial for attenuated inflammatory response to maintain intestinal homeostasis.</a></h1><p>Retinoic -related orphan receptor α (RORα) functions as a transcription factor for various biological processes, including circadian rhythm, cancer, and metabolism. Here, we generate intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RORα-deficient (RORα) mice and find that RORα is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis by attenuating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. RORα mice exhibit excessive intestinal inflammation and highly activated inflammatory responses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse  model. Transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of RORα leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes in IECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals corecruitment of RORα and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on NF-κB target promoters and subsequent dismissal of CREB binding protein (CBP) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for transcriptional repression. Together, we demonstrate that RORα/HDAC3-mediated attenuation of NF-κB signaling controls the balance of inflammatory responses, and therapeutic strategies targeting this epigenetic regulation could be beneficial to the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474681>Oral Supplementation of Tocotrienol-Rich Fraction Alleviates Severity of Ulcerative  in Mice.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative  (UC) is characterized by damaged colonic mucosa and submucosa layers that are caused by excessive inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress. This study aimed to examine the use of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) in mitigating damages caused by UC on the colon epithelium. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC mice were treated with vehicle control, TRF, alpha-tocopherol (αTP) and 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA). Observable clinical signs, quality of stool, histopathological scoring, inflammatory and oxidative markers were assessed. Vitamin E levels of colons and plasma were quantified. Oral supplementation of TRF significantly reduced the severity of DSS-induced UC by lowering the disease activity index (DAI) and histopathological inflammatory scoring. TRF also attenuated the DSS-induced enlargement of spleen and shortening of the colon. TRF has demonstrated marked anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties indicated by the attenuation of DSS-induced upregulation of inflammation and oxidative stress markers including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, myeloperoxidase (MPO), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and pNF-κB. These improvements were similar to that of 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) treatment. In contrast, αTP did not demonstrate evident clinical and histopathological improvements. The superior protective effect of TRF may be ascribed to the preferential absorption of TRF by the gut mucosa. TRF alleviated the signs and symptoms of acute UC in murine model via the reduction of local inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress. These effects suggested that TRF could serve as a gut health supplement for preventive measures for UC condition in patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31119329>Identification and characterization of a novel anti-inflammatory lipid isolated from Mycobacterium vaccae, a soil-derived bacterium with immunoregulatory and stress resilience properties.</a></h1><p>Mycobacterium vaccae (NCTC 11659) is an environmental saprophytic bacterium with anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and stress resilience properties. Previous studies have shown that whole, heat-killed preparations of M. vaccae prevent allergic airway inflammation in a murine model of allergic asthma. Recent studies also demonstrate that immunization with M. vaccae prevents stress-induced exaggeration of proinflammatory cytokine secretion from mesenteric lymph node cells stimulated ex vivo, prevents stress-induced exaggeration of chemically induced  in a model of inflammatory bowel disease, and prevents stress-induced anxiety-like defensive behavioral responses. Furthermore, immunization with M. vaccae induces anti-inflammatory responses in the brain and prevents stress-induced exaggeration of microglial priming. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying anti-inflammatory effects of M. vaccae are not known.Our objective was to identify and characterize novel anti-inflammatory molecules from M. vaccae NCTC 11659.We have purified and identified a unique anti-inflammatory triglyceride, 1,2,3-tri [Z-10-hexadecenoyl] glycerol, from M. vaccae and evaluated its effects in freshly isolated murine peritoneal macrophages.The free fatty  form of 1,2,3-tri [Z-10-hexadecenoyl] glycerol, 10(Z)-hexadecenoic , decreased lipopolysaccharide-stimulated secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 ex vivo. Meanwhile, next-generation RNA sequencing revealed that pretreatment with 10(Z)-hexadecenoic  upregulated genes associated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) signaling in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, in association with a broad transcriptional repression of inflammatory markers. We confirmed using luciferase-based transfection assays that 10(Z)-hexadecenoic  activated PPARα signaling, but not PPARγ, PPARδ, or retinoic  receptor (RAR) α signaling. The effects of 10(Z)-hexadecenoic  on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated secretion of IL-6 were prevented by PPARα antagonists and absent in PPARα-deficient mice.Future studies should evaluate the effects of 10(Z)-hexadecenoic  on stress-induced exaggeration of peripheral inflammatory signaling, central neuroinflammatory signaling, and anxiety- and fear-related defensive behavioral responses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615012>Korean Traditional Medicine () Ameliorates  by Regulating Gut Microbiota.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to examine the anti- activity of  (JGT) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  and explore changes of the gut microbial community using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and metabolomics approaches. It was found that treatment with JGT or 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) alleviated the severity of  symptoms by suppressing inflammatory cytokine levels of IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ. The non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis of gut microbiome revealed that JGT groups were clearly separated from the DSS group, suggesting that JGT administration altered gut microbiota. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were decreased by DSS but increased by JGT include  and .

In the biologic era, it still remains the treatment of choice in mild-to-moderate UC. Positioning of this therapeutic class in moderate-to-severe UC is less clear. : Several studies demonstrated the ability of 5-ASA to induce endoscopic remission to a similar extent as anti-TNF therapy on the moderate segment of UC. Histologic remission is achieved after induction in up to 45% of patients treated with topical 5-ASA and 30% with oral formulations. Aminosalicylates offer a favorable safety profile compared to that of immunomodulators and biologics. High-dose 5-ASA therapy may be a valuable option for patients with moderately active disease, and physicians should weigh the pros and cons of this strategy in selected patients. Whether aminosalicylates should be continued in combination with thiopurines or biologic therapy remains under debate. : In the era of biologics, aminosalicylates remain the first-line therapy in patients with mild UC, and have to be considered in case of moderate UC, given their favorable risk-benefit profile. We suggest that 5-ASA should be used in moderate patients without poor prognostic factors, while biologics should be preferred otherwise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481750>Small heat shock protein CRYAB inhibits intestinal mucosal inflammatory responses and protects barrier integrity through suppressing IKKβ activity.</a></h1><p>Alpha B-crystallin (CRYAB) is an important member of the small heat shock protein family, and plays a protective and therapeutic role in neurological inflammation. CRYAB expression was assessed in cultured HT29 and Caco-2 cells and inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and  models in mice. Lentivirus-overexpressing and CRSIPR/Cas9 systems were used in different cells to upregulate and silence CRYAB expression, respectively. Cell permeable recombined fusion protein TAT-CRYAB was injected intraperitoneally into dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced  in mice to assess its anti-inflammatory effects. CRYAB was found to be significantly decreased in the inflamed mucosa from IBD patients and DSS-induced  in mice, and negatively correlated with the levels of TNF-α and IL-6, respectively. Enforced expression of CRYAB suppressed expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8) via inhibiting the IKK complex formation, whereas lack of CRYAB expression markedly enhanced proinflammatory responses. Consistently, administration of TAT-CRYAB fusion protein significantly alleviated DSS- or TNBS-induced  in mice and protected intestinal barrier integrity. CRYAB regulates inflammatory response in intestinal mucosa by inhibiting IKKβ-mediated signaling and may serve as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187840>Monofloral honey from a medical plant, Prunella Vulgaris, protected against dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative  via modulating gut microbial populations in rats.</a></h1><p>Honeys produced from medicinal plants hold great promise for human health. Herein, we determined the chemical composition and gastrointestinal protective effects of a novel monofloral honey from Prunella vulgaris (PVH). The physicochemical parameters (moisture, sugars, pH, protein content, diastase activity, and hydroxymethylfurfural) of the PVH samples met the criteria specified in European Union regulations and Chinese National Standards.

Based on the published literature, there has been no attempt to conduct a comparative assessment of the biological activity and the phytochemical profiles of the leaves and stem bark of  extracted using methanol, ethyl acetate, and water. By high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-ESI-MS) analysis, quinic, shikimic, gallic, and protocatechuic  were tentatively identified from all the extracts, while chlorogenic, caffeic, ferulic, and dodecanedioic  were only characterised from the leaves extracts. Additionally, a pharmacological study was carried out to evaluate potential protective effects that are induced by the extracts in rat colon and colon cancer HCT116 cell line. In general, the methanol and water extracts of  leaves and stem bark showed potent radical scavenging and reducing properties. It was noted that the stem bark extracts were more potent antioxidants as compared to the leaves extracts. The methanol extract of  leaves showed the highest acetyl (4.68 mg galantamine equivalent/g) and butyryl (4.0 mg galantamine equivalent/g) cholinesterase inhibition. Among ethyl acetate extracts, the pharmacological investigation suggested stem bark ethyl acetate extracts to be the most promising. This extract revealed ability to protect rat colon from lipopolysaccharide-induced oxidative stress, without exerting promoting effects on HCT116 cell line viability and migration.

Omega 3 (ω3) fatty  (eicosapentanoic  and docosahexaenoic ) show an indispensable role in the inflammatory processes and, for these reasons, we aimed to review the effects of these  on UC and CD. Databases such as PUMED and EMBASE were searched, and the final selection included fifteen studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The results showed that ω3 fatty  reduce intestinal inflammation, induce and maintain clinical remission in UC patients, and are related with the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, decrease disease activity and increase the quality of life of CD patients. Furthermore, the consumption of these fatty  may be related to a reduced risk of developing IBD. Many studies have shown the beneficial effects of ω3 as adjunctive in the treatment or prevention of UC or CD. Nevertheless, most were performed with a small number of patients and there are many variations in the mode of consumption, the type of food or the type of formulation used.

A pancreatic lesion is one of the extraintestinal lesions in patients with IBD. Acute pancreatitis is the representative manifestation, and various causes of pancreatitis have been reported, including those involving adverse effects of drug therapies such as 5-aminosalicylic  and thiopurines, gall stones, gastrointestinal lesions on the duodenum, iatrogenic harm accompanying endoscopic procedures such as balloon endoscopy, and autoimmunity. Of these potential causes, autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a relatively newly recognized disease and is being increasingly diagnosed in IBD. AIP cases can be divided into type 1 cases involving lymphocytes and IgG4-positive plasma cells, and type 2 cases primarily involving neutrophils; the majority of AIP cases complicating IBD are type 2. The association between IBD and chronic pancreatitis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatic cancer, etc. has also been suggested; however, studies with high-quality level evidence are limited, and much remains unknown.

We aimed to investigate the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of IBD in central Taiwan. We retrospectively analyzed patients with IBD diagnosed at our hospital between January 2000 and September 2018. The diagnostic criteria were based on endoscopic and pathologic findings. Clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. A total of 190 patients with IBD were enrolled (80 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 110 with ulcerative  (UC)). The mean age at diagnosis was 38.4 years (CD: 36 years, UC: 40 years). Male patients accounted for the majority of patients (71.1%). The male-to-female ratio was 3 : 1 for CD and 2.1 : 1 for UC. Current and ever smokers accounted for 30.5% of all patients. Only 4.2% of patients had a family history of IBD. Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) were reported in 7.9%, and colorectal cancers (CRCs) were reported in 2.1% of all patients. In patients with CD, the ileal type was the most common disease phenotype (57.5%), and the stricturing type was the most common disease behavior (60.0%). In patients with UC, left-sided  was the predominant disease extent (42.7%). The seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) was 13.3%. The incidence of perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) in patients with UC was 22%. 5-Aminosalicylic  were the preferred treatment for UC, whereas corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologic agents were preferred for CD. In patients with CD, the bowel resection rate was 38.8%, and the incidence of hip avascular necrosis was 3.8%. In Taiwan, patients with IBD showed a male predominance, lack of familial clustering, a higher prevalence of HBV infection, and a lower prevalence of p-ANCA, EIMs, and CRC.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative  are complex diseases that are heterogeneous at the clinical, immunological, molecular, genetic, and microbial levels. Individual contributing factors have been the focus of extensive research. As part of the Integrative Human Microbiome Project (HMP2 or iHMP), we followed 132 subjects for one year each to generate integrated longitudinal molecular profiles of host and microbial activity during disease (up to 24 time points each; in total 2,965 stool, biopsy, and blood specimens). Here we present the results, which provide a comprehensive view of functional dysbiosis in the gut microbiome during inflammatory bowel disease activity. We demonstrate a characteristic increase in facultative anaerobes at the expense of obligate anaerobes, as well as molecular disruptions in microbial transcription (for example, among clostridia), metabolite pools (acylcarnitines, bile , and short-chain fatty ), and levels of antibodies in host serum. Periods of disease activity were also marked by increases in temporal variability, with characteristic taxonomic, functional, and biochemical shifts. Finally, integrative analysis identified microbial, biochemical, and host factors central to this dysregulation.

Chemically induced  models are relatively easy and rapid to develop. The 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)  model is one of the main models in the experimental studies of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) since inflammation induced by TNBS mimics several features of Crohn's disease. This review aims to summarize the existing literature and discuss different protocols for the induction of chronic model of TNBS-induced . We searched MEDLINE via Pubmed platform for studies published through December 2018, using MeSH terms (Crohn Disease.kw) OR (Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.kw) OR (, Ulcerative.kw) AND (trinitrobenzenesulfonic .kw) AND (disease models, animal.kw) AND (mice.all).

Chronic TNBS-induced  is made with multiple TNBS intrarectal administrations in an average dose of 1.2 mg using a volume lower than 150 μL in 50% ethanol. The strains mostly used are Balb/c and C57BL/6 with 5-6 weeks. To characterize the preclinical model the parameters more used include body weight, stool consistency and morbidity, inflammatory biomarkers like interferon (IFN)-γ, myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10, presence of ulcers, thickness or hyperemia in the colon, and histological evaluation of the inflammation.

There is a strong association for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), another autoimmune cholestatic liver disease, is not usually associated with IBD. The aim of this study is to report cases of PBC-associated IBD, their clinical features, response to therapy, and long-term outcome.Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collated database identified patients presenting with PBC-associated IBD from 2006 to 2016. PBC has been diagnosed according to accepted criteria, and staged according to Ludwig classification. A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was performed to rule out PSC. Response to ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) therapy has been assessed by using the Paris II criteria.A total of six patients (five females) with PBC-associated IBD were identified. Median age at IBD diagnosis was 44.7 years (range 22.5-48.8). Three had Crohn's disease and three ulcerative . PBC was diagnosed in all after IBD had been diagnosed. All patients presented with cholestasis, all were positive for anti-mitochondrial antibodies. MRCP was normal in all. Liver biopsy was consistent with PBC (stage I in one, stage II in five). One year after initiation of UDCA, all patients responded to therapy.Herein we describe the largest series reported to date of PBC-associated IBD.

In all, 192 LAB strains were isolated from healthy human feces, of which 8 strains showed excellent nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory activity. Peptidoglycan extracts of these 8 LAB strains were subjected to NO assay, Western blot, and ELISA. Among the 8 tested strains, extracts of 4 strains significantly inhibited the production of NO, related enzyme activities such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2, and key cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6 in RAW264.7 cells. The 4 strains belonged to Lactobacillus (CAU1054, CAU1055, CAU1064, and CAU1301). Oral administration of the 4 strains inhibited DSS-induced body weight loss, colon shortening, and colon damage in ICR mice. The colon tissue of the mice treated with Lactobacillus plantarum strain CAU1055 had significantly reduced levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase 2, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-6. We found that strain CAU1055 could be used as a candidate probiotic strain for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

All-trans retinoic  (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut inflammation has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting inflammation-induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut inflammation, respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS  model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic  (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco-2 cells. All-trans retinoic  altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1. All-trans retinoic  cotreatment (1 mg/kg BW, i.p. daily) of DSS-treated mice (3% in drinking water for 7 days) alleviated -associated weight loss, diarrheal phenotype, and induction of IL-1β and CXCL1 and a decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon.Our data showing upregulation of DRA under normal and inflammatory conditions by ATRA demonstrate a novel role of this micronutrient in alleviating IBD-associated diarrhea.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Developing novel efficient therapeutics is still a common interest for clinicians. Increasing evidence have shown that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) contributes to the pathological pain state in some pain models. Resveratrol (RSV) has showed promising potential for the treatment of neuropathic pain and inflammatory pain. However, whether RSV has analgesic effect on visceral pain and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we established the  model through intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS), and found that TNBS induced colonic inflammation and visceral hypersensitivity. Meanwhile, astroglial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), TRAF6, phosphorylation of NF-κB (pNF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels were increased in L6-S1 spinal cord after TNBS enema. Then, intrathecal injection of TRAF6 siRNA attenuated visceral pain, blocked the upregulation of pNF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the spinal cord in TNBS mice. Furthermore, spinal administration of NF-κB inhibitor, BAY11-7082 reversed the pain behavior and suppressed spinal TNF-α and IL-1β expression in TNBS mice. Finally, repeated intrathecal injection of RSV reversed TNBS-induced visceral pain hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, TNBS-induced enhancement of spinal GFAP, TRAF6, pNF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β were reduced by the same treatment of RSV. In conclusion, our results suggest that RSV exerts the effects of antinociception on -induced visceral hyperalgesia through inhibition of spinal TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway and the production of inflammatory mediators in the spinal cord, suggesting a new application of RSV for the treatment of visceral pain.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The agents tested were: alpha-lactoalbumin (ALAC), a whey protein rich in tryptophan, effective in some animal models of epilepsy and on colon/intestine inflammation, valproic  (VPA), an effective antiepileptic drug in this seizure model, mesalazine (MSZ) an effective aminosalicylate anti-inflammatory treatment against ulcerative  and sodium butyrate (NaB), a short chain fatty  (SCFA) normally produced in the intestine by gut microbiota, important in maintaining gut health and reducing gut inflammation and oxidative stress. Intestinal inflammation was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administration for 6 days. Drug treatment was started on day 3 and lasted 11 days, when seizure susceptibility to PTZ was measured along with intestinal inflammatory markers (i.e. NF-κB, Iκ-Bα, COX-2, iNOS), histological damage, disease activity index (DAI) and SCFA concentration in stools. DSS-induced  increased seizure susceptibility and while all treatments were able to reduce intestinal inflammation, only ALAC and NaB exhibited significant antiepileptic properties in mice with induced , while they were ineffective as antiepileptics at the same doses in control mice without . Interestingly, in DSS-treated mice, VPA lost part of its antiepileptic efficacy in comparison to preventing seizures in non-DSS-treated mice while MSZ remained ineffective in both groups. Our study demonstrates that reducing intestinal inflammation through ALAC or NaB administration has specific anticonvulsant effects in PTZ-treated mice. Furthermore, it appears that intestinal inflammation may reduce the antiepileptic effects of VPA, although we confirm that it decreases seizure threshold in this group. Therefore, we suggest that intestinal inflammation may represent a valid antiepileptic target which should also be considered as a participating factor to seizure incidence in susceptible patients and also could be relevant in reducing standard antiepileptic drug efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427744>Hyaluronic -bilirubin nanomedicine for targeted modulation of dysregulated intestinal barrier, microbiome and immune responses in .</a></h1><p>While conventional approaches for inflammatory bowel diseases mainly focus on suppressing hyperactive immune responses, it remains unclear how to address disrupted intestinal barriers, dysbiosis of the gut commensal microbiota and dysregulated mucosal immune responses in inflammatory bowel diseases.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative  patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic -induced murine model of . The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of  that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Our results demonstrated that the treatment with NVPS significantly decreased the number and sizes of tumors and reduced the incidence of intestinal tumors. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR, we analyzed the bacterial composition of the fecal samples obtained from mice. The results demonstrated that the alterations in the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes caused by the AOM/DSS treatment were significantly reversed in response to the NVPS treatment. Moreover, the short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing genera, including butyric -producing genera (Butyricicoccus, Butyrivibrio and Butyricimonas) and acetic -producing genera (Lachnospiraceae UCG 001, Lachnospiraceae UCG 006, and Blautia), were drastically enriched following the NVPS intervention. These compositional alterations induced by the NVPS were associated with the suppressed colonic inflammation and carcinogenesis. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an appreciable capability of NVPS to restore the gut microbiota profile altered by AOM/DSS, indicating the potential of NVPS as a promising prebiotic candidate for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567972>Serum cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor profiles and their modulation in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative  (UC) and Crohn disease (CD) are the most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because these subtypes of IBD are characterized by periods of activity and remission, an understanding of the modulation of biochemical markers with the clinical features of IBD or its treatment, may be useful for determining the correct treatment protocol.This study aimed to evaluate the serum levels of 27 protein biomarkers to determine their association with IBD, correlation with clinical findings of disease, and modulation according to the pharmacologic therapy.A case-control study was carried out in Zacatecas, Mexico. The 27 protein profiles of serum from 53 participants (23 UC, 11 CD, and 19 controls) were evaluated using the Pro Human Cytokine 27-Plex immunoassay (Bio-Rad).Considering the controls as a reference, the group with IBD endoscopic activity showed higher serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) (P < .05). Interferon-induced protein 10 (IP-10) was associated with extraintestinal symptoms of disease (P = .041). Both PDGF-BB and interleukin 6 (IL-6) showed the strongest correlations with clinical features of IBD. Levels of IL-6, IL-7, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were higher with 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) + Azathioprine therapy than controls (P < .05). Combined therapy with 5-ASA + Adalimumab led to the strongest changes in marker modulation: IL-4, IL-5, IL-15, and PDGF-BB, were upregulated (P < .05).Elevated serum levels of G-CSF, IL-1Ra, and PDGF-BB were associated with IBD endoscopic activity, and of IP-10 with extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. Combined therapy of 5-ASA + Adalimumab produced significant upregulation of IL-4, IL-5, IL-15, and PDGF-BB. This information may be useful for deciding on the course of pharmacologic therapy for patients with IBD and for generating new therapy alternatives to improve the outcome of patients with IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362489>In-Situ Imaging of Azoreductase Activity in the Acute and Chronic Ulcerative  Mice by a Near-Infrared Fluorescent Probe.</a></h1><p>Azoreductase (AzoR) is an essential reductive enzyme which is closely associated with the intestinal disease such as ulcerative  (UC). To date, only a few fluorescent probes for detecting AzoR activity in bacteria or cells have been constructed successfully. It is still challenging to design fluorescent probes for in situ monitoring AzoR in vivo. In this paper, a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe (Cy-Azo) based on hemicyanine is designed and synthesized. The emission of the probe is located at 735 nm in the NIR region, which is favorable for its application in vivo. In addition, Cy-Azo shows high sensitivity to AzoR activity with 17-fold fluorescence enhancement and is particularly selective to AzoR over other enzymes, ions, and amino . Meanwhile, a possible response mechanism (the azo group in Cy-Azo is reduced by AzoR and cleaved resulting in the production of Cy-NH) was proposed and verified by HPLC, MS, and theory calculation. In addition, based on low cell cytotoxicity, Cy-Azo is successfully applied in visualizing the activity of AzoR in two cell lines (HCT116 and HepG2 cells) and three types of bacteria (, , and ). In particular, due to its NIR emission, the probe can monitor AzoR activity in acute and chronic UC mice models. To our knowledge this is the first fluorescent probe for detecting AzoR activity in vivo, which can provide much important information for the diagnosis and treatment of UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628978>In Vitro and Human Pharmacoscintigraphic Evaluation of an Oral 5-ASA Delivery System for Colonic Release.</a></h1><p>5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) is the most widely used drug for the treatment of ulcerative . The benefits of targeted delivery of 5-ASA to the large intestine are well known, resulting in reduced systemic absorption and increased local concentrations at the disease site. In the present study, a 5-ASA colon delivery system based on the time-dependent strategy, exploiting the relatively consistent small intestinal transit time (SITT), was manufactured and evaluated in vitro as well as in vivo. The system was obtained by successive spray-coating of an immediate-release tablet core with low-viscosity HPMC and Eudragit® L. The enteric film was effective in preventing release during the acidic stage of the in vitro test, while the HPMC coating brought about reproducible lag phases prior to release in phosphate buffer medium. A γ-scintigraphy investigation pointed out that, following administration to fasted and fed volunteers, disintegration of the units never occurred prior to colon arrival. In all cases, a lag time preceded the appearance of the drug and its N-acetyl metabolite in the bloodstream, which was found to correlate with the time of disintegration in a linear mode. The plasma levels of the drug and metabolite as well as their cumulative urinary recovery were relatively low with respect to those reported when 5-ASA is delivered to the small bowel.Copyright © 2019.

VOC analysis has allowed us to highlight differences in lifestyles, intestinal microbiota, and metabolism. New innovative methods have been described that allow the detection and quantification of a broad spectrum of metabolites present in exhaled breath even at very low levels, some of which have been shown to be indicators of pathological conditions.Five studies were analyzed that involved VOC analysis in relation to type of diet. All of them showed that the type of diet can have an impact on metabolites excreted and therefore can be a useful tool in the nutritional studies related to metabolism and health and disease status. Two studies concerned VOC analysis in inflammatory bowel diseases, and the results showed that VOCs can distinguish active disease from remission; VOC profile is clearly different in patients. In particular, CH 1-pentadecene, 3-methyl-1-butanal, octane, acetic , alpha-pinene, and m-cymene are elevated in active ulcerative . Four studies examined VOCs in gastric and colorectal tumors showing a change in metabolic biomarkers of cancer patients compared to the control group. Finally, the study of VOCs in breast milk has improved the understanding of the potential health risks of exposure of children to chemical pollutants.VOC analysis allowed to highlight differences in behavior, lifestyle, and metabolism of individuals. Analytical methods are continuously developed to allow for better detection and quantification of metabolites, thus enabling the detection of a broader spectrum of pathophysiology and disease biomarkers.Copyright © 2019 Mariangela Rondanelli et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31112869>Kakkalide and irisolidone alleviate 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced  in mice by inhibiting lipopolysaccharide binding to toll-like receptor-4 and proteobacteria population.</a></h1><p>The flower of Pueraria lobata (family Fabaceae) has been clinically used in traditional Chinese medicine to counteract symptoms associated with drinking alcohol and liver injury and to alleviate inflammatory diseases. Its major constituent kakkalide is metabolized to irisolidone by gut microbiota. This research study was undertaken to understand the anti- mechanism of kakkalide and irisolidone in vitro and in vivo. Kakkalide and its metabolite irisolidone inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated NF-κB activation and TNF-α expression in macrophages. They also inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of IRAK1 and TAK1 and activation of NF-κB by inhibiting the binding of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated LPS in vitro. Orally administered irisolidone or kakkalide alleviated colon shortening and myeloperoxidase activity in mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)-induced . Their treatments also protected epithelial cell disruption and infiltration of CD11b/CD11c cells in the colon. Furthermore, they suppressed TNBS-induced expression of M1 macrophage markers TNF-α, CD80, CD86, and Arg2 expression while the expression of M2 macrophage markers Arg1, CD163, CD206, and IL-10 was induced. They also suppressed the fecal Proteobacteria population. Overall, the anti-colitic effects of irisolidone were superior to those of kakkalide. Kakkalide and its metabolite irisolidone inhibited inflammation in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting LPS binding to toll-like receptor 4 and gut proteobacteria population.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The etiology of  cases can be manifold, and diet can significantly affect onset and outcome of . While many forms of acute  are easily treatable, chronic forms of  such as ulcerative  and Crohn's disease (summarized as inflammatory bowel diseases) are multifactorial with poorly understood pathogenesis. Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by exacerbated immune responses causing epithelial dysfunction and bacterial translocation. There is no cure and therapies aim at reducing inflammation and restoring intestinal barrier function. Unfortunately, most drugs can have severe side effects. Changes in diet and inclusion of nutritional supplements have been extensively studied in cell culture and animal models, and some supplements have shown promising results in clinical studies. Most of these nutritional supplements including vitamins, fatty  and phytochemicals reduce oxidative stress and inflammation and have shown beneficial effects during experimental  in rodents induced by dextran sulphate sodium or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic , which remain the gold standard in pre-clinical  research.

Accumulating evidence points to the significance of estrogen action not only in tumors of hormonally regulated tissues such as the breast, endometrium and ovary, but also in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). The effects of estrogens in physiological and pathophysiological conditions are mediated by the nuclear estrogen receptors α and β, as well as the membrane-bound G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). The roles of GPER in CRC development and progression, however, remain poorly understood. Studies on the functions of GPER in the colon have shown that this estrogen receptor regulates colonic motility as well as immune responses in CRC-associated diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative . GPER is also involved in cell cycle regulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, proliferation, apoptosis, vascularization, cell migration, and the regulation of fatty  and estrogen metabolism in CRC cells. Thus, multiple lines of evidence suggest that GPER may play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. In this review, we present the current state of knowledge regarding the contribution of GPER to colon function and CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095872>Urine Proteome Changes in a TNBS-Induced  Rat Model.</a></h1><p>Urine is an important resource for biomarker research. Urine proteins reflect not only renal diseases but also changes in other organs in the body. However, urine has rarely been used to reflect on inflammatory bowel disease.In the present study, a trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced  rat model is used to mimic the human inflammatory bowel disease Crohn's disease (CD). Urine samples are analyzed by label-free and TMT-labeled proteomic quantitative methods.77 urinary proteins are significantly changed in the  rats compared with that in the controls. These proteins are further validated by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) targeted proteomic quantitative methods. Based on the human protein tissue atlas, carbonic anhydrase 1, ribonuclease pancreatic gamma type, and neutral and basic amino  transport protein rBAT are highly enriched in the gastrointestinal tract. Among the nine PRM-validated proteins, carbonic anhydrase 1, neutrophil collagenase, and neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin were previously reported as IBD-associated proteins (all exhibiting consistent trends with the observation herein), whereas the others are newly discovered by this study.The results provide valuable clues for future study of urine biomarker of inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn's disease.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of febuxostat against ulcerative , and to elucidate the potential mechanisms involved. Experimental  was induced in mice by intrarectal administration of 5% acetic . Mice were treated with febuxostat (10 and 20 mg/kg/day, orally) for three days. Results showed that body weight loss, colon shortening, macroscopic damage and histopathological changes of colonic mucosa were reduced in mice treated with febuxostat. Treatment of mice with febuxostat significantly increased the levels of glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonyl protein, xanthine oxidase, nitric oxide (NO) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity of colon tissue compared with those in the acetic -induced  group. The expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) as a key regulator of inflammation in the colonic tissue was decreased by febuxostat. Furthermore treatment with febuxostat significantly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and interferon (IFN)-γ, while increased the levels of IL-10 compared with the  group. These results suggest that febuxostat is able to decrease the severity of acetic -induced  by inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses through NF-κB pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although the underlying mechanisms of IBD remain unclear, growing evidence has shown that dysregulated immune system reactions in genetically susceptible individuals contribute to mucosal inflammation. However, conventional treatments have been effective in inducing remission of IBD but not in preventing the relapse of them. In this way, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) therapy has been recognized as a promising treatment for IBD due to their immunomodulatory properties, ability to differentiate into several tissues, and homing to inflammatory sites. Even so, literature is conflicted regarding the location and persistence of MSC in the body after transplantation. For this reason, recent studies have focused on the paracrine effect of the biofactors secreted by MSC, especially in relation to the immunomodulatory potential of soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) and extracellular vehicles that are involved in cell communication and in the transfer of cellular material, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic . Moreover, treatment with interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1β causes MSC to express immunomodulatory molecules that mediate the suppression  cell-contact dependent mechanisms. Taken together, we present an overview of the role of bioactive factors and cell membrane proteins derived from MSC as a cell-free therapy that can improve IBD treatment.©The Author(s) 2019.

In this study, the Zn-enriching ability of 33 probiotics in a medium or an aqueous solution was evaluated. A Lactobacillus plantarum strain, CCFM242, with a superior Zn-enriching ability was screened. Among the cellular components, the cell wall played the most important role in the Zn binding of L. plantarum CCFM242. The carboxyl and amino groups on the surface of the strain were also vital for Zn enrichment. Upon optimization of the Zn-enriching procedure, the Zn-binding ability of this strain reached 24.89 ± 0.50 mg g dry biomass. Compared to the treatment of ZnSO or L. plantarum CCFM242, oral supplementation with Zn-enriched L. plantarum CCFM242 resulted in a higher serum Zn level, enhanced levels of mRNA expression of colonic tight junctions, increased levels of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) in colonic contents, and stronger modulatory effects on the anti-oxidant and immune defense systems in the gut of normal mice. Zn-Enriched L. plantarum CCFM242 treatment also offered more significant protective effects against dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced  in mice compared to the treatment of ZnSO or L. plantarum CCFM242 alone. The synergistic effect of Zn-enriched L. plantarum CCFM242 may be due to the increased tolerance of the strain to the gastrointestinal tract conditions and the higher bioavailability of Zn after the metal-enrichment process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428451>Sustained suppression of IL-18 by employing a vaccine ameliorates intestinal inflammation in TNBS-induced murine .</a></h1><p>To develop IL-18 peptide-based virus-like particle vaccines that elicit autoantibodies against IL-18 and to evaluate the  effects of the vaccines in murine .Recombinant IL-18 vaccines were constructed, and the effects of the vaccines were evaluated in trinitrobenzene sulfonic -induced acute and chronic  in mice.Two murine IL-18 peptide-based vaccines (A and D) were developed, which induced relative long-lasting specific antibodies against IL-18.

There are growing interests in using whole-food-based strategies to prevent colonic inflammation via potential synergistic interactions among different components within the whole foods. However, limited research is focused on the inhibitory effects of the whole P. eryngii mushroom against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).The protective effects of P. eryngii mushroom against IBD are determined in the dextran-sodium-sulfate-induced  model in mice. Dietary administration of P. eryngii (1 and 3% w/w) alleviates colonic inflammation, which is evidenced by decreased disease index, increased colon length, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines in the colonic mucosa. Sequencing the 16S rRNA genes of fecal microbiota demonstrates that P. eryngii mushroom significantly alters the structure of microbiota and partially reverses the shifts of fecal microbiota induced by DSS treatment. The levels of SCFAs in the cecum are increased by P. eryngii mushroom.Overall, the results demonstrate the anti-inflammatory and microbiota-modulating effects of P. eryngii mushroom as a whole-food-based ingredient against IBD, and its potential as a prebiotic agent to prevent inflammation-related disorders in humans.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

CAC is a type of colorectal cancer (CRC), the third leading cause of cancer death.  (ZJ) fruit contains bioactive components such as polysaccharides, triterpenoid , and flavonoids, and it has shown anti-inflammatory property. The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effect of dietary ZJ on -associated colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. Mice ( = 42, two sets) were injected with azoxymethane (AOM) followed by three cycles of 2% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water to induce CAC. Simultaneously, those mice were fed with ZJ diet for 70 days (5% or 10% w/w). Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by LSD Bonferroni test. Dietary ZJ decreased fecal blood, diarrhea, disease activity index (DAI), spleen weight ( < 0.001), and the number of tumors ( < 0.001). In addition, dietary ZJ increased colon length ( < 0.001) and suppressed the activation of NF-кB/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway.

The present study aimed to elucidate the expression of TRPV4 in the gastrointestinal tract and the pathogenic roles of TRPV4 in dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced . TRPV4-immunoreactivity was detected in epithelial-like cells of the mouse tongue, esophagus, stomach, ileum, and colon; TRPV4 expression in the tongue was higher than other gastrointestinal tracts. TRPV4 colocalized with a type IV cell marker sonic hedgehog in circumvallate papillae. These findings suggest that TRPV4 contributes to sour taste sensing by regulating type III taste cell differentiation in mice. DSS-induced  was significantly attenuated in TRPV4-knockout (TRPV4KO) mice when compared to wild-type mice. DSS treatment upregulated TRPV4 expression in vascular endothelia of colonic mucosa and submucosa. DSS treatment increased vascular permeability, which was abolished in TRPV4KO mice. The activation of TRPV4 decreased VE-cadherin expression in mouse aortic endothelial cells exposed to TNF-α. These findings indicate that the upregulation of TRPV4 in vascular endothelial cells contributes to the progression of colonic inflammation via the activation of vascular permeability.

In this study, the supercritical fluid extract of  and  Roscoe (AZ-SFE) was obtained by an optimized extraction process and it was chemically characterized. The anti-inflammatory effect and underlying mechanism of AZ-SFE were evaluated in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cell model and a 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)-induced  rat model. AZ-SFE notably inhibited the production of NO in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and it inhibited the proliferation of Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced splenocytes with suppression of the Th1 immune response. In vivo, the study demonstrated that AZ-SFE significantly alleviated disease activity, colonic shortening, macroscopic damage and histological injury of TNBS-treated rats with reduction of oxidative stress, suppression of inflammatory cytokines, and modulation of hepcidin and serum iron. These findings suggested that AZ-SFE may be a promising supplement for current IBD therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301538>Ilexgenin A prevents early colonic carcinogenesis and reprogramed lipid metabolism through HIF1α/SREBP-1.</a></h1><p>Ilexgenin A (IA), the main bioactive compound from Ilex hainanensis Merr., has significant hypolipidemic activities. However, the effects of IA on -associated colorectal cancer (CRC) and its mechanisms are still unknown.The study was designed to evaluate the effect of IA on CRC and explore its underlying mechanisms.The effect of IA on  related CRC were evaluated in azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mice and the underlying mechanisms were revealed by metabolomics, which were further validated in vivo and in vitro.The Balb/c mice were treated with AOM/DSS to induce CRC model and fed with normal diet with or without 0.02% IA. After the experimental period, samples of plasma were collected and analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time off light mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF). Multivariate statistical tools were used to identify the changes of serum metabolites associated with CRC and responses to IA treatment. HT 29 and HCT 116 cells were stimulated by palmitate (PA) and cultured under hypoxia. Western blot, Q-PCR, and Immunofluorescence staining were performed to confirm the molecular pathway in vivo and in vitro.Our results showed IA significantly inhibited the inflammatory  symptoms such as disease activity index score, shortening of colon tissues and the increase of inflammatory cytokines. In metabolomic study, 31 potential metabolites associated with CRC were identified and 24 of them were reversed by IA treatment. Most of biomarkers were associated with arachidonic  metabolism, glycerophospholipid catabolism, and phospholipid metabolism, suggesting lipid metabolism might be involved in the beneficial effect of IA on CRC. Furthermore, we also found IA could decrease the expressions of SREBP-1 and its target gene in the colon tissues of AOM/DSS mice. It could down-regulate the triglyceride (TG) content and the expressions of HIF1α, SREBP-1, FASN, and ACC in HT 29 and HCT 116 cells. The inhibitory effect of IA on SREBP-1 was also attenuated by desferrioxamine (DFX), suggesting HIF1α is involved in the regulation of IA on SREBP-1.IA prevents early colonic carcinogenesis in AOM/DSS mice and reprogramed lipid metabolism partly through HIF1α/SREBP-1.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

In this study, the effect of Qingchang Huashi granule (QCHS) on UC and its underlying mechanisms were explored using both animal and cell culture experiments. A rat UC model was induced with trinitro-benzene-sulfonic  (TNBS), concentrations of the cytokines IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-α were signiﬁcantly up-regulated and the concentrations of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 were signiﬁcantly down-regulated compared with the control group (P < 0.05). In contrast, the QCHS and salicylazosulfapyridine (SASP) groups reversed these modulations (P < 0.05). A UC cell model in HT-29 cells was generated using TNF-α combined with lipopolysaccharide treatment. Cells treated with QCHS were used to investigate the possible mechanisms. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins, including Bax/Bcl-2, caspase-3, caspase-9, Fas/Fas-L, and Rafl in the QCHS and SASP groups, were significantly lower than that in the control group in both animal and cell experiments (P < 0.05). In addition, the in vitro results indicate changes in these indicators mediate the MEK/ERK signaling pathways via SGK1. Our results suggested that QCHS could be beneficial in preventing UC progression as an alternative drug for UC treatment.Copyright © 2019.

The objective of this study was to investigate prescribing patterns and non-persistence of anti-TNFα therapy for the treatment of IBD in a real-world scenario.Data from the Korean National Health Insurance claims database obtained between 2010 and 2014 were evaluated to identify patients with IBD who had received anti-TNFα therapy (infliximab or adalimumab). Patient characteristics and prescribing patterns were investigated. The non-persistence rate and associated reasons were determined in patients who initiated therapy between 2010 and 2012.A total of 131,158 patients with UC and 57,286 with CD were identified. Of these 1747 UC (1.3%) and 3731 (6.5%) CD patients had received anti-TNFα therapy and were included in the analysis. Infliximab was prescribed more frequently than adalimumab (84.6% vs 15.4% in UC and 80.7% vs 19.4% in CD); 81.0% of UC and 72.0% of CD patients received anti-TNFα alone or in combination with 5-aminosalicylic . The non-persistence rate of anti-TNFα therapy was 72.6% and 80.4% in the UC and CD groups, respectively, with discontinuation of medication being the most common reason in both the UC and CD groups (63.9% and 73.3%, respectively).The use of anti-TNFα therapy was seen to be low, with a high rate of non-persistence.

However, the knowledge about the AT2 receptor involvement in this process is still evolving. We previously found that in an experimental model of , AT2 receptor activation can contribute to the impairment of the muscle contractility in vitro in the course of inflammation. Here, we investigated the potential alleviating effects of the in vivo treatment of PD123319 (1-[[4-(Dimethylamino)-3-methylphenyl]methyl]-5-(diphenylacetyl)-4,5,6,7- tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine-6-carboxylic  ditrifluoroacetate), AT2 receptor antagonist, in 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic  (DNBS)-induced rat model of . The effects of i.p PD123319 (0.3, 3 and 10 mg/kg) administration to rats subjected to intra-rectal DNBS instillation were investigated. The study revealed that the colon injury and the inflammatory signs were ameliorated by PD123319 when visualized by the histopathological examination. The colon shortening, myeloperoxidase activity, and colonic expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and iNOS were downregulated in a dose-dependent manner in DNBS-induced  rats treated with PD123319 and the anti-oxidant defense machinery was also improved. The mechanism of these beneficial effects was found in the ability of PD123319 to inhibit NF-κB activation induced by DNBS. The colonic contractility in inflamed tissues was also improved by PD123319 treatment. In conclusion, our data have demonstrated previously that undescribed proinflammatory effects for the AT2 receptors in DNBS-induced  in rats in which they are mediated likely by NF-κB activation and reactive oxygen species generation.

The gut microbiota connect diet to the metabolism by producing small molecules via diverse metabolic pathways. In this study we aimed to investigate the dietary preferences of IBD patients, and to explore the interactions among gut microbiota composition, dietary components, and metabolites in relation to IBD.Dietary preferences of IBD patients (including those with ulcerative  [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]) and health controls were investigated, and their gut microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analyses of fecal and biopsy samples. The metabolite profiles of the samples were then analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses.The daily intake of folic , niacin, vitamins C and D, calcium, and selenium differed significantly between patients with IBD and healthy controls. A decrease in long-chain (such as arachidic, and oleic ) and medium-chain fatty  (sebacic  and isocaproic ) as well as bile  was observed in patients with IBD. Compared with healthy controls, 22 microbial species (including Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and Clostridium clostridioforme CAG132) in the UC group and 37 microbial species (such as Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) in the CD group were found to be correlated to diet and metabolites.

However, the phenotypes and functions of human MSCs (hMSCs)-treated Breg cell subsets are not yet clear.  Purified B cells were cocultured with MSCs and the phenotypes and immunomodulatory functions of the B cells were analyzed by FACS and proliferation assays . Also, a trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced mouse  model was employed to detect the function of MSC-treated Breg cells .  We demonstrated that coculturing with hMSCs significantly enhanced the immunomodulatory activity of B cells by up-regulating IL-10 expression. We then identified that a novel regulatory B cell population characterized by CD23 and CD43 phenotypic markers could be induced by hMSCs. The CD23CD43 Breg cells substantially inhibited the inflammatory cytokine secretion and proliferation of T cells through an IL-10-dependent pathway. More significantly, intraperitoneal injection of hMSCs ameliorated the clinical and histopathological severity in the mouse experimental  model, accompanied by an increase in the number of CD23CD43 Breg cells. The adoptive transfer of CD23CD43 B cells effectively alleviated murine , as compared with the CD23CD43 B cells.

Alcohol consumption was found in both groups, but Arabs smoked more (46% vs. 12%, respectively, P < 0.05). Obstructive phenotype was lower in Arabs (10% vs. 32%, P < 0.05). 5-aminosalicylic  and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha were prescribed for the Arab and Ashkenazi groups (89% and 21%, respectively). The need for surgical intervention due to disease severity and/or complications was not significant (22% vs. 24%).Despite similar reports of NOD2/CARD15 mutations, Crohn's disease is more common than ulcerative  within the Arab-Israeli population.

However, the expression of CXCL chemokines governing the infiltration of neutrophils in UC has not been well elucidated.  In this experimental study, the UC model was induced in Wistar rats by administration of 2 mL 4% acetic  into the large colon through the rectum. Animals were anesthetized after 48 hrs; their colon tissue samples were isolated for macroscopic and histopathological examinations. The expression of CXCL family was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique.  Heavy infiltration of neutrophils, coagulation necrosis, and ulcers were observed in H&E staining, which pathologically proved the UC model. qRT-PCR results showed that ELR CXC chemokines such as CXCL6 and CXCL3 had the highest expression in the UC group, which was 49 and 28 times higher than that of the control group, respectively. In addition, other chemokines of this group including CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL7 had a significant increase compared to the control group (P≤0.05). However, ELR CXC chemokines such as CXCL4, CXCL13, and CXCL16 showed a smaller upregulation, while CXCL14 chemokine showed a significant decrease compared to the control group (P≤0.05). However, the expression of CXCL9-12 and CXCL17 did not change.

At day 14, after macroscopic survey of the abdominal cavity, the anastomotic area was submitted to histologic and immunohistochemical analysis, evaluation of myeloperoxidase activity, fibrosis, epithelial integrity, NF-κ B activation, expression of inflammatory cytokines, and extracellular matrix-related genes.Anastomotic leakage and mortality associated with high-risk anastomosis decreased with treatment with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (P < .03). Application of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells resulted in lower histologic scores (P = .011), decreased deposition of collagen fibers (P = .003), preservation of goblet cells (P = .033), decreased myeloperoxidase activity (P = .012), decreased accumulation of CD4+ T-cells (P = .014) and macrophages (P = .011) in the lamina propria, a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells (P = .008), and the activation of NF-κ B (P = .036). Overexpression of IL-17, TNF-α , IFN-γ, and metalloproteinases in the acellular culture solution-treated, high-risk anastomosis group decreased (P < .05) to near normal values with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells treatment.Improvements in outcomes of a high-risk colonic anastomosis with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells therapy reflect the immunomodulatory activity and healing effect of these cells, even after just topical administration and reinforces their use in future translational research.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although conventional therapeutic strategies have demonstrated to be effective in the IBD treatment, it is necessary to incorporate novel therapeutic agents that target other mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, such as oxidative stress. For this reason, the efficacy in vivo of two antioxidant compounds, melatonin and resveratrol, has been investigated in an animal model of TNBS (2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic ) induced . PET/CT (Positron emission tomography/Computer Tomography) scans were performed to assess disease activity and evaluate treatment response. SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) values, body weight changes and histological evaluation were used as inflammatory indices to measure the efficacy of both treatments. SUV values increased rapidly after induction of , but after the beginning of the treatment (day 3) a statistically significant decrease was observed on days 7 and 10 in treated animals compared to the non-treated group. This remission of the disease was also confirmed by histological analysis of the colon tissue using the Nancy histological index (p value < 0.05 for differences between non-treated and both groups of treated animals). Moreover, statistical analysis showed a correlation (R = 65.52%) between SUV values and weight changes throughout the treatment.

It remains unknown whether DMB can ameliorate ulcerative  (UC). In this study, trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)-induced  rats were treated with  extract (GAE) or DMB for 10 days. Body weight, food and water intake, rectal bleeding score, diarrhea score, and histopathological parameters were measured. Rat colon were collected to determine myeloperoxidase, nitric oxide levels, and inflammatory cytokines expression. In addition, the role of DMB on lipopolysaccharide stimulated RAW264.7 cell inflammatory response and intestine smooth muscle contraction was determined. The results showed that GAE and DMB treatment could significantly alleviate TNBS-induced UC. Colon morphological alteration, nitric oxide level, and inflammatory cytokines level, such as nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and cyclooxygenase-2, were decreased. In addition, DMB attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide release and proinflammatory cytokine expression in RAW264.7 cells.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic inflammatory condition characterized as an autoimmune disorder that includes dysfunctions in the T helper (Th)/T regulatory cell (Treg) balance, which normally plays pivotal roles in immune homeostasis. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of DHA to ameliorate IBD by restoring the Th/Treg cell balance. To this end, we established mouse models of  induced by oxazolone (OXA) and 2,4,6-trinitro-benzene sulfonic  (TNBS). We then treated mice with DHA at 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg/day. DHA treatment ameliorated  signs and reduced lymphocyte infiltration and tissue fibrosis. Moreover, DHA decreased the numbers of Th1 and Th17 cells and Th9 and Th22 cells in TNBS- or OXA-induced , respectively, and increased Tregs in both models. DHA (0.8 mg/mL) also inhibited activated CD4+ T lymphocytes, which was accompanied by apoptosis induction. Moreover, it promoted heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) production in vitro and in vivo, concomitant with CD4+ T cell apoptosis and restoration of the Th/Treg balance, and these effects were blocked by treatment with the HO-1 inhibitor Sn-protoporphyrin IX.

Long-term treatment maintenance with aminosalicylates and higher therapeutic requirements were recorded. The cumulative incidence of treatment escalation was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared by the log-rank test. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors of treatment with immunomodulators, biological agents or surgery.A total of 457 patients were included, of whom 28% ( = 126) were non-responders to aminosalicylates. The cumulative probability for a step-up approach within 20 years of follow up was 35%, mainly due to steroid-dependent . Risk factors for treatment escalation were age ≤27 years (hazard ratio 2.31, 95% confidence interval 1.36-3.92), extensive  (hazard ratio 1.65, 95% confidence interval 1.04-2.60), Mayo endoscopic subscore ≥2 (hazard ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.02-2.06) and extraintestinal manifestations (hazard ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.03-4.05).Aminosalicylates represent an effective maintenance therapy.

It remained largely unknown how antibiotic-induced dysbiosis confers the risk for enhanced inflammatory response. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that SCFAs, their receptors and transporters mediate the antibiotic long-term effects on the functional state of colonic mucosa and susceptibility to the experimental . Male Wistar rats were treated daily for 14 days with antibiotic ceftriaxone (300 mg/kg, i.m.) or vehicle; euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation in 1, 14 or 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. We found increased cecum weight and sustained changes in microbiota composition after ceftriaxone treatment with increased number of conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria, E. coli, Clostridium, Staphylococcus spp. and hemolytic bacteria even at 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. The concentration of SCFAs was decreased after ceftriaxone withdrawal. We found decreased immunoreactivity of the FFA2, FFA3 receptors, SMCT1 and increased MCT1 & MCT4 transporters of SCFAs in colon mucosa. These changes evoked a significant shift in colonic mucosal homeostasis: the disturbance of oxidant-antioxidant balance; activation of redox-sensitive transcription factor HIF1α and ERK1/2 MAP kinase; increased colonic epithelial permeability and bacterial translocation to blood; morphological remodeling of the colonic tissue. Ceftriaxone pretreatment significantly reinforced inflammation during experimental  56 days after ceftriaxone withdrawal, which was confirmed by increased histopathology of , Goblet cell dysfunction, colonic dilatation and wall thickening, and increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-10).

There is an urgent need for effective and safe IBD therapies. Accelerated resolution of inflammation is a new strategy for the management of inflammatory diseases. For effective and safe IBD treatment, herein a smart nanotherapy (i.e. oxidation-responsive nanoparticles containing a proresolving annexin A1-mimetic peptide Ac2-26, defined as AON) is developed, which can release packaged Ac2-26, in response to highly expressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) at diseased sites. AON effectively protects Ac2-26 from degradation in the enzyme-rich environment of the gastrointestinal tract. By delivering this nanotherapy to the inflamed colons of mice with IBD, site-specific release and accumulation of Ac2-26 in response to high levels of ROS at the inflammatory sites are achieved. Mechanistically, the Ac2-26-containing, oxidation-labile nanotherapy AON effectively decreases the expression of proinflammatory mediators, attenuates trafficking and infiltration of inflammatory cells, promotes efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, and increases phenotypic switching of macrophages. Therapeutically, AON reduces symptoms of inflammation, accelerates intestinal mucosal wound healing, reshapes the gut microbiota composition, and increases short-chain fatty  production. Additionally, oral delivery of this nanomedicine shows excellent safety profile in a mouse model, conferring the confidence for further development of a targeted precision therapy for IBD and other inflammatory diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31229077>Rape bee pollen alleviates dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  by neutralizing IL-1β and regulating the gut microbiota in mice.</a></h1><p> is a major chronic disease in today's society. Consumption of phenolic compounds can protect against . We examined the phenolic compounds of rape bee pollen extract (RPE) and investigated its prevention of DSS-induced  in C57BL/6 mice. HPLC-DAD-ECD analysis showed that 7 phenolic compounds were tentatively identified in RPE, of which kaempferol had the highest content (19.87 mg/g), followed by sinapic  and rosmarinic . RPE at 21.2 g/kg BW (HD - high-dose group) and 10.6 g/kg BW (LD - low-dose group) ameliorated colon shortening, spleen swelling and colon weight reduction, improved the structure of colonic villi, glandular structures and crypts, which was further confirmed by conventional histological assessment, and inhibited the activities of related inflammatory cytokines. In particular, IL-1β expression was downregulated by approximately 90% compared with that of the model group. Additionally, treatment with RPE altered the gut microbial structure of mice with , showing that the abundances of Allobaculum and Bacteroides were significantly reduced and the abundance of Lactobacillus was markedly increased. This study indicated that RPE could protect the colon from DSS-induced  by increasing antioxidant capacity, alleviating inflammation and regulating the gut microbiota.

Abelmoschus manihot (AM) extracted from Flos Abelmoschus manihot that has been applied for treating chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we showed that AM significantly alleviated DSS-induced  in mice. AM modified gut microbiota composition, increased microbial diversity, and in particularly, elevated the abundance of short chain fatty  (SCFAs)-producing gut microbiota in colitic mice. Consequently, levels of SCFAs especially butyrate and acetate were increased upon AM treatment, which, primarily through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) pathway, led to the enhanced Treg generation and the suppressed Th17 development. Together, we herein provide the first evidences to support that AM, a natural plant-derived complex, can potentially reset gut microbiome and metabolism, resume immune and tissue homeostasis, and hence prevent , which may provide a new perspective on IBD pathogenesis and suggest a novel microbiota-targeting therapy for inflammatory gut diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we aimed to assess the status of trace elements, minerals, and vitamins in a large cohort of children with IBDs.Medical records of children diagnosed with IBDs during 2000-2016 were reviewed retrospectively. Retrieved data included demographics, disease characteristics, disease activity indices, anthropometric measures, and specific trace elements, minerals, and vitamins at diagnosis and during follow-up.Out of 359 children with IBD (158 [44%] females, median age at diagnosis 14.1 years, interquartile range [IQR] 12.0-16.0), 240 (67%) were diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) and 119 (33%) with ulcerative  (UC). Median follow-up time was 7 years (IQR 5-10). The prevalence of deficiencies in patients with CD at diagnosis and last follow-up, respectively, were iron (88% and 39.5%), zinc (53% and 11.5%), vitamin D (39% and 36%), and folic  (10% and 13%). In patients with UC, frequencies were: iron (77% and 40%), vitamin D (49% and 33%), zinc (31% and 10%), and folic  (3.8% and 9.7%). Magnesium and vitamin B12 deficiencies were rare. For both diseases, iron deficiency was associated with hypoalbuminemia. Deficiencies in iron and zinc were more common in patients with CD than those with UC.Deficiencies in iron, zinc, and vitamin D are common at pediatric IBD diagnosis with limited improvement during follow-up, whereas deficiencies in magnesium and vitamin B12 are rare.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31290223>The impact of dietary fermentable carbohydrates on a postinflammatory model of irritable bowel syndrome.</a></h1><p>A low fermentable carbohydrate (FODMAP) diet is used in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease when irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms occur. There is concern that the diet could exacerbate inflammation by modifying microbiota and short-chain fatty  (SCFA) production. We examined the effect of altering dietary FODMAP content on inflammation in preclinical inflammatory models.C57BL/6 mice were given 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for 5 days and recovered for 3 weeks (postinflammatory, n = 12), or 5 days (positive-control, n = 12). Following recovery, DSS-treated or control mice (negative-control, n = 12) were randomized to 2-week low- (0.51 g/100 g total FODMAP) or high-FODMAP (4.10 g) diets. Diets mimicked human consumption containing fructose, sorbitol, galacto-oligosaccharide, and fructan. Colons were assessed for myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and histological damage. Supernatants were generated for perforated patch-clamp recordings and cytokine measurement. Cecum contents were analyzed for microbiota, SCFA, and branched-chain fatty  (BCFA). Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni.Inflammatory markers were higher in the positive-control compared with negative-control and postinflammatory groups, but no differences occurred between the two diets within each treatment (MPO P > .99, histological scores P > .99, cytokines P > .05), or the perforated patch-clamp recordings (P > .05). Microbiota clustered mainly based on DSS exposure. No difference in SCFA content occurred. Higher total BCFA occurred with the low-FODMAP diet in positive-control (P < .01) and postinflammatory groups (P < .01).In this preclinical study, reducing dietary FODMAPs did not exacerbate nor mitigate inflammation. Microbiota profile changes were largely driven by inflammation rather than diet. Low FODMAP intake caused a shift toward proteolytic fermentation following inflammation.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621446>Dapsone reduced acetic -induced inflammatory response in rat colon tissue through inhibition of NF-kB signaling pathway.</a></h1><p> The purpose of this study is to examine the protective effects of Dapsone on inflammation of intestinal tissue through inhibition of NF-kB pathway in acetic -induced  in rats.  Acute  was produced by intra-rectal instillation of 2 mL of 4% acetic  diluted in normal saline.

Evaluation of macroscopic and microscopic damages were done. Myeloid peroxidase enzyme (MPO) activity was measured by a biochemical technique. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) activity was identified by ELISA, and the expression level of pNF-kB protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) and dapsone (12.5 mg/kg) decreased the macroscopic and microscopic damages compared with acetic  group ( ˂ .001).

We studied the effects of cell-specific IDO1 expression in the epithelium at baseline and during intestinal inflammation in mice.We generated transgenic mice that overexpress fluorescence-tagged IDO1 in the intestinal epithelium under control of the villin promoter (IDO1-TG). We generated intestinal epithelial spheroids from mice with full-length Ido1 (controls), disruption of Ido1 (knockout mice), and IDO1-TG and analyzed them for stem cell and differentiation markers by real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. Some mice were gavaged with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E2348/69) to induce infectious ileitis, and ileum contents were quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Separate sets of mice were given dextran sodium sulfate or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  to induce ; intestinal tissues were analyzed by histology. We utilized published data sets GSE75214 and GDS2642 of RNA expression data from ilea of healthy individuals undergoing screening colonoscopies (controls) and patients with Crohn's disease.Histologic analysis of small intestine tissues from IDO1-TG mice revealed increases in secretory cells. Enteroids derived from IDO1-TG intestine had increased markers of stem, goblet, Paneth, enteroendocrine, and tuft cells, compared with control enteroids, with a concomitant decrease in markers of absorptive cells. IDO1 interacted non-enzymatically with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor to inhibit activation of NOTCH1. Intestinal mucus layers from IDO1-TG mice were 2-fold thicker than mucus layers from control mice, with increased proportions of Akkermansia muciniphila and Mucispirillum schaedleri. Compared to controls, IDO1-TG mice demonstrated an 85% reduction in ileal bacteria (P = .03) when challenged with enteropathogenic E coli, and were protected from immune infiltration, crypt dropout, and ulcers following administration of dextran sodium sulfate or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic . In ilea of Crohn's disease patients, increased expression of IDO1 correlated with increased levels of MUC2, LYZ1, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor, but reduced levels of SLC2A5.In mice, expression of IDO1 in the intestinal epithelial promotes secretory cell differentiation and mucus production; levels of IDO1 are positively correlated with secretory cell markers in ilea of healthy individuals and Crohn's disease patients. We propose that IDO1 contributes to intestinal homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In contrast to drug therapies, which exert several side effects, herbal remedies have constantly attracted the attention of researchers. Therefore, in the present study, a mother tincture (MT) from fresh, young, non-woody  L. branches with leaves was obtained using distillation-based techniques. Further, this was used to assess its in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activities and anti-inflammatory properties, and to validate it as a potential phytotherapeutic treatment for IBD. The characterization of the tincture included common phytochemical screening assays for antioxidant capacity measurement, cell viability assays on Caco-2 colon cells, and in vivo assessment of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by histopathological and ultrastructural analysis of the intestinal mucosa, measurement of reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation, and gene expression of the inflammation markers (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) in intestine after oral administration to an experimental mouse model of colon inflammation () developed by intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS). Our study proved that administration of 25 or 50 mg  MT/kg of body weight/day by gavage for 7 days succeeded in inhibiting the inflammatory process induced by TNBS in the intestine, most probably because of its rich contents of flavonoids and phenolic compounds.

Endoscopy makes it possible to diagnose celiac disease before it leads to malnutrition and allows the detection of microscopic  as a cause of watery diarrhea. At the severe end of the symptom spectrum enteric dysmotility marks the border at which IBS ceases to be a functional disorder and becomes a genuine motility disorder. Joint hypermobility or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is present in a substantial proportion of patients with enteric dysmotility. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction is the end-stage of a large number of very rare disorders in which failed peristalsis is the common denominator. Nutritional needs and symptom control are essential in the management of pseudo-obstruction.

We hypothesized that the regulation of tight junction (TJ) barrier, Th17 cell differentiation, and/or, macrophage activation by cinnamic  derivatives were involved in the propolis-mediated anti-inflammatory effect. Mice were orally administered 2% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in combination with either the feeding control or a diet containing 0.3% ethanol extract of Brazilian propolis for 9 days. DSS administration induced acute  in mice, whereas the propolis extract mitigated DSS-induced weight loss; colon shortening; increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; reduced expression of TJ proteins, such as zonula occludens, junctional adhesion molecule-A, occludin, and claudins; and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL) 6, and IL-17a. Cinnamic  derivatives, such as artepillin C and caffeic  phenethyl ester, present in the propolis extract suppressed the IL-17 production from cultured murine splenocytes through decreased retinoic -related orphan receptor gT expression. Baccharin, drupanin, and culifolin, which are also present in Brazilian propolis, reduced the TNF-α and/or IL-6 production by suppressing inflammatory signaling in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. Taken together, the regulation of Th17 differentiation and macrophage activation by cinnamic  derivatives, at least in part, contribute to the anti-inflammatory effect mediated by Brazilian propolis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Exemplar CD  HM605 and LF82 were unable to survive within  murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. In keeping with this, pre-incubation of macrophages with hydrocortisone (0.6 µM for 24 h) caused 70.49 ± 12.11% inhibition of intra-macrophage replication.

Polysaccharides (PLS) extracted from plants such as Morinda Citrifolia Linn present therapeutic potential in treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative  (UC).To evaluate the anti-inflammatory action of Noni PLS against the intestinal damage in UC induced by acetic  in mice.In acetic -induced , the mice were treated intraperitoneally (ip) with PLS (0.1, 0.3, and 3.0 mg/kg) or subcutaneously (sc) with dexamethasone (2.0 mg/kg) 30 min before euthanasia to determine the best dose of PLS with an anti-inflammatory effect in the course of UC. The colonic tissue samples were collected for macroscopic, wet weight, microscopic and biochemical (myeloperoxidase (MPO), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrate/nitrite (NO/NO), cytokines, and cyclooxygenase (COX-2)) analyses.Treatment with PLS reduced the intestinal damage induced by acetic  as it reduced macroscopic and microscopic scores and the wet weight of the colon. In addition, MPO activity and levels of GSH, MDA, NO/NO, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and COX-2 expression reduced.This study suggests that PLS exhibits anti-inflammatory action against intestinal damage by reducing inflammatory cell infiltration, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory action of cytokines, and COX-2 expression in the inflamed colon.

One of their main tasks is to facilitate the excretion of these substances and eliminate their toxicities in most phase 1 reactions. Endogenous substrates of CYPs include steroids, bile , eicosanoids, cholesterol, vitamin D and neurotransmitters. About 80% of currently used drugs and environmental chemicals comprise exogenous substrates for CYPs. Genetic polymorphisms of CYPs may affect the enzyme functions and have been reported to be associated with various diseases and adverse drug reactions among different populations. In this review, we discuss the role of some critical CYP isoforms (CYP1A1, CYP2D6, CYP2J2, CYP2R1, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP4F3, CYP24A1, CYP26B1 and CYP27B1) in the pathogenesis or aetiology of ulcerative  concerning gene polymorphisms.

This study aimed to review the current knowledge regarding the efficacy of dietary and nutritional intervention in IBD patients. Exclusive enteral nutrition might be inferior to corticosteroid treatment in adults with active Crohn's disease (CD) but might even be superior considering the adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment in children. Total parenteral nutrition has no advantage over enteral nutrition, which is considered a more physiologic modality in organ function. Current guidelines do not yet recommend ω3-polyunsaturated fatty  supplementation for the prevention and maintenance of remission in IBD patients. Dietary fiber supplementation could be effective in the relief of symptoms and maintenance of remission in ulcerative  (UC). Although vitamin D may be favorable to clinical course of IBD and bone density. Probiotic supplementation has proven to be effective in preventing and treating pouchitis for UC but is less effective in treating CD. Nutritional interventions not only correct nutritional deficiencies but also improve symptoms and clinical courses of the disease. Hence, nutritional approaches need to be developed to significantly evaluate the effectiveness of dietary interventions used to treat IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657664>Cyanidin-3--Glucoside and Cyanidin Protect Against Intestinal Barrier Damage and 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic -Induced .</a></h1><p>Anthocyanin-rich extracts have shown anti-inflammation activity in mouse  models. Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is one of the widespread anthocyanins in plants, and cyanidin (Cy) is the aglycone of C3G that can be generated in intestine under gut microorganism metabolism. To explore the anti-inflammatory activity of single anthocyanins compound and show the potential mechanism, the protective effects of C3G and its aglycone Cy on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)-induced  in mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Caco-2 cellular monolayer inflammation were studied. The results showed that both C3G and Cy significantly improved the clinical symptoms and relieved the histological damage in TNBS-challenged mice. The activity of myeloperoxidase and the excretion of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and interferon- were also significantly inhibited at the administration dosage of 200 mol/kg.  studies showed that when LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells were pretreated with C3G and Cy, the destruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier was ameliorated due to the improvement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and Lucifer yellow flux values, while there were no significant difference between C3G and Cy groups at the same dosage. Similarly, both C3G and Cy suppressed nitric oxide production and inflammatory cytokines secretion of LPS-induced Caco-2 cells. C3G and its aglycone Cy had similar anti-inflammatory activity in both  mice and Caco-2 cells. The results suggest that C3G and Cy may exert anti-inflammatory effects by protecting the intestinal barrier as well as by suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion. Thus, C3G or Cy could be potential preventive agents or supplementary medicines for inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31143502>Characterizing intestinal strictures of Crohn's disease  by endoscopic photoacoustic imaging.</a></h1><p>Crohn's disease (CD) is one type of inflammatory bowel disease where both inflammation and fibrosis cause the thickening of the bowel wall and development of the strictures. Accurate assessment of the strictures is critical for the management of CD because the fibrotic strictures must be removed surgically. In this study, a prototype capsule-shaped acoustic resolution photoacoustic (PA) endoscope, which can perform mulitwavelength side-view scanning, was developed to characterize the intestinal strictures of CD. The imaging performance of the probe was tested in phantom experiments and a rabbit trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) model with acute (inflammatory only) or chronic (mixed fibrotic and inflammatory)  . The motion artifacts due to intestinal peristalsis and the respiratory motion of the animals were compensated to improve image qualities. Quantitative molecular component images derived from multi-wavelength PA measurements of normal, acute and chronic intestinal strictures demonstrated statistically significant differences among the three groups that were confirmed by histopathology. A longitudinal study demonstrated the capability of the system in monitoring the development of fibrosis. The results suggest that the proposed novel, capsule-shaped acoustic resolution PA endoscope can be used to characterize fibrostenotic disease .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520534>Serotonin exerts a direct modulatory role on bladder afferent firing in mice.</a></h1><p>Functional disorders (i.e. interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome) are associated with hyperexcitability of afferent nerves innervating the urinary tract and the bowel, respectively. Various non-5-HT receptor mRNA transcripts are expressed in mouse urothelium and exert functional responses to 5-HT. Whilst 5-HT receptors were not detected in mouse urothelium, 5-HT receptors expressed on bladder sensory neurons plays a role in bladder afferent excitability both under normal conditions and in a mouse model of chronic visceral hypersensitivity. These data suggest that the role 5-HT receptors play in bladder afferent signalling warrants further study as a potential therapeutic target for functional bladder disorders.Serotonin (5-HT) is an excitatory mediator that in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a physiological role in gut-brain signalling and is dysregulated in functional GI disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients suffering from IBS frequently suffer from urological symptoms characteristic of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, which manifests due to cross-sensitization of shared innervation pathways between the bladder and colon. However, a direct modulatory role of 5-HT in bladder afferent signalling and its role in colon-bladder neuronal crosstalk remain elusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the action of 5-HT on bladder afferent signalling in normal mice and mice with chronic visceral hypersensitivity (CVH) following trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced . Bladder afferent activity was recorded directly using ex vivo afferent nerve recordings. Expression of 14 5-HT receptor subtypes, the serotonin transporter (SERT) and 5-HT-producing enzymes was determined in the urothelium using RT-PCR. Retrograde labelling of bladder-projecting dorsal root ganglion neurons was used to investigate expression of 5-HT receptors using single cell RT-PCR, while sensory neuronal and urothelial responses to 5-HT were determined by live cell calcium imaging. 5-HT elicited bladder afferent firing predominantly via 5-HT receptors expressed on afferent terminals. CVH animals showed a downregulation of SERT mRNA expression in urothelium, suggesting increased 5-HT bioavailability. Granisetron, a 5-HT antagonist, reversed bladder afferent hypersensitivity in CVH mice. These data suggest 5-HT exerts a direct effect on bladder afferents to enhance signalling. 5-HT antagonists could therefore be a potential therapeutic target to treat functional bladder and bowel disorders.© 2019 The Authors.

We previously described that proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a nuclear scaffolding protein pivotal in DNA synthesis, controls neutrophil survival through its cytosolic association with procaspases. We herein showed that PCNA associated with p47phox, a key subunit of NADPH oxidase, and that this association regulated ROS production. Surface plasmon resonance and crystallography techniques demonstrated that the interdomain-connecting loop of PCNA interacted directly with the phox homology PX) domain of the p47phox. PCNA inhibition by competing peptides or by T2AA, a small-molecule PCNA inhibitor, decreased NADPH oxidase activation in vitro. Furthermore, T2AA provided a therapeutic benefit in mice during trinitro-benzene-sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced  by decreasing oxidative stress, accelerating mucosal repair, and promoting the resolution of inflammation. Our data suggest that targeting PCNA in inflammatory neutrophils holds promise as a multifaceted antiinflammatory strategy.© 2019 Ohayon et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521614>Mucin O-glycans facilitate symbiosynthesis to maintain gut immune homeostasis.</a></h1><p>The dysbiosis of gut microbiota has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Heavily glycosylated mucin establishes a first-line barrier against pathogens and serves as a niche for microbial growth.To elucidate relationships among dysbiosis, abnormal mucin utilisation, and microbial metabolic dysfunction, we analysed short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) and mucin components in stool samples of 40 healthy subjects, 49 ulcerative  (UC) patients, and 44 Crohn's disease (CD) patients from Japan.Levels of n-butyrate were significantly lower in stools of both CD and UC patients than in stools of healthy subjects. Correlation analysis identified seven bacterial species positively correlated with n-butyrate levels; the major n-butyrate producer, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, was particularly underrepresented in CD patients, but not in UC patients. In UC patients, there were inverse correlations between mucin O-glycan levels and the production of SCFAs, such as n-butyrate, suggesting that mucin O-glycans serve as an endogenous fermentation substrate for n-butyrate production. Indeed, mucin-fed rodents exhibited enhanced n-butyrate production, leading to the expansion of RORgtTreg cells and IgA-producing cells in colonic lamina propria. Microbial utilisation of mucin-associated O-glycans was significantly reduced in n-butyrate-deficient UC patients.Mucin O-glycans facilitate symbiosynthesis of n-butyrate by gut microbiota. Abnormal mucin utilisation may lead to reduced n-butyrate production in UC patients.

The purpose of this study was to investigate, in an experimental , the consequences of daily oral iron ingestion in the early period on the inflammatory response, the spleen T helper (Th) profiles and the associated molecular mechanisms. Juvenile mice orally received microencapsulated ferric iron or water for 6 weeks. On adult mice, we induced a sham or experimental trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) moderate  during the last week of the experiment before sacrificing the animals 7 days later. The severity of the gut inflammation was assessed by macroscopic damage scores (MDS) and the myeloperoxidase activity (MPO). Th profiles were evaluated by the examination of the splenic gene expression of key transcription factors of the Th differentiation (, ,  and ) and the methylation of their respective promoter. While TNBS-induced  was associated with a change of the Th profile (notably an increase in the  ratio in the spleen), the -inhibition induced by ferric iron was associated with a limitation of the splenic Th profiles perturbation. The inhibition of the splenic  gene overexpression was associated with an inhibition of promoter hypomethylation. In summary, mice treated by long-term oral ferric iron in the early period of life exhibited an inhibition of  associated with the inhibition of the splenic  promoter hypomethylation and gene overexpression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31366843>[Practice Examples of Academic Detailing -Prescription Support Based on Basic Pharmaceutical Science and Evidence].</a></h1><p>Better prescription assistance can be provided by applying basic pharmaceutical science concepts, and by considering evidence from clinical trials. For example, several drugs are currently used to treat ulcerative  (UC), a form of inflammatory bowel disease. In general, after a drug is administered, it is first absorbed into the upper part of the small intestine and then enters the bloodstream. However, 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA), which is commonly used to treat UC, acts locally on the colonic mucosa; its absorption must be prevented in the upper gastrointestinal tract so that it can be delivered to the colorectal mucosa. Therefore, in this case, it is important to consider drug dissolution tests rather than pharmacokinetics. Currently, three types of 5-ASA formulations are available: a pH-dependent release formulation, a time-dependent release formulation, and a combination of the two at maximum dosages of 3600, 4000, and 4800 mg, respectively. Although it is often thought that selecting a high dose is better, the clinical effectiveness of 5-ASA is determined by the amount of drug actually delivered to the lesion. Therefore, rather than dosage, it is most important to understand differences in drug solubility. It is beneficial to provide prescription assistance for the treatment of UC by 5-ASA, because when 5-ASA fails, a steroid or expensive biological drug is administered. We will present a case study and discuss the future of prescription assistance using Academic Detailing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120312>Potential Mechanisms of 3, 4-Oxo-Isopropylidene-Shikimic  in Ameliorating 2, 4, 6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic -Induced  in Rats.</a></h1><p>Previously, we reported that 3, 4-oxo-isopropylidene-shikimic  (ISA) has therapeutic potential in experimental  in rats. This study aimed to elucidate the potential mechanisms of ISA on the inflammatory response in rats with 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced . After the induction of , rats were orally administered ISA for 12 days. Then, the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) in the blood and colon tissues, and the protein level of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 in cytoplasm and nucleus of colon tissues were evaluated. As a result, an enhanced inflammatory response was observed in rats with experimental . However, the treatment with ISA significantly ameliorated the inflammatory response, which was manifested as a significant decrease in the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-8, TNF-α mRNA, P-selectin, E-selectin, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, MMP9 and MMP9 mRNA in rat blood and colon tissues, respectively, and a significant decrease in the levels of IFN-γ/IL-4, and the NF-κBp65 activity coefficient. Therefore, the therapeutic effect of ISA on experimental  may be related to its inhibitory effect on the expression of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and MMP9, which may be involved in the inhibition of the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κBp65.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520133>Beneficial effect of a mixture of vitamin-producing and immune-modulating lactic  bacteria as adjuvant for therapy in a recurrent mouse  model.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic and relapsing-remitting disorders that affect the gastrointestinal tract. Previously, the administration of folate and riboflavin-producing lactic  bacteria (LAB) or an immune-modulating strain showed beneficial effects as they were able to reduce the acute inflammation in mouse models. The aim of this work was to evaluate a mixture of vitamin-producing and immune-modulating LAB administering together with an anti-inflammatory drug during the remission period of a mouse model of recurrent . BALB/c mice were intrarectally instilled with trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) and those who recovered from this acute challenge were given the LAB mixture, mesalazine, or the combination of both (mesalazine + LAB) during 21 days, followed by a second challenge with TNBS. Control mice instilled with ethanol (vehicle of TNBS) and receiving the different treatments were also evaluated in order to study the effect of chronic anti-inflammatory therapy. The combination of mesalazine and LAB mixture was the most effective to decrease the intestinal damage at macroscopic and histological levels and to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) in intestinal fluids. In animals instilled with ethanol, mesalazine produced a loss of body weight and intestinal damages with increased IL-6. These side effects were prevented by the co-administration of mesalazine and the LAB mixture. The LAB blend did not affect the primary anti-inflammatory treatment, was able to improve it, and also prevented the side effects of this therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329006>Dietary Management of Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative , is a life-long relapsing and remitting condition characterized by inflammation of the intestine. While the exact pathogenesis of IBD is unclear, the current belief is that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in development of disease. Management options include nutritional, pharmacological, and surgical therapies. In particular, nutritional therapies for IBD have garnered significant interest due to their limited side effect profile, bowel-sparing nature, and naturalistic approach. This review will examine the role of diet in the pathogenesis and malnutrition in IBD, and will discuss dietary approaches to management of IBD, including exclusive enteral nutrition, specific carbohydrate diet, anti-inflammatory diet, and food supplements (specifically curcumin and long-chain 3 polyunsaturated fatty ). Past and recent literature on these subjects were reviewed in Medhub and Scopus databases for this review article with a focus on pediatric and high-quality publications. At this time, these approaches seem to be safe and show promise of an efficacious sole or supplemental role in the treatment of IBD, but randomized, prospective studies are lacking. Additional studies investigating these diets and food supplements are needed to provide more information on their efficacy, mechanism, applicability, and safety.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498864>Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Short-Chain Fatty  Characterization in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Alterations in gut microbiota and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) have been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the results are conflicting. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to explore the characterization of SCFAs in IBD patients and their potential role in the occurrence and development of IBD.Case-control studies investigating SCFAs in IBD patients were identified from several English databases. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the random-effects model.The SMDs of acetate, valerate, and total SCFAs in ulcerative  (UC) patients were -0.51 (95% CI, -0.90 to -0.13), -0.65 (95% CI, -1.02 to -0.28), and -0.51 (95% CI, -0.95 to -0.07), respectively. The SMDs of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in patients with active UC were -1.74 (95% CI, -3.15 to -0.33), -2.42 (95% CI, -4.24 to -0.60), and -1.99 (95% CI, -3.39 to -0.60), respectively. However, the SMD of butyrate in UC patients in remission was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.34 to 1.11). In addition, the SMDs of acetate, butyrate, and valerate in Crohn's disease (CD) patients were -1.43 (95% CI, -2.81 to -0.04), -0.77 (95% CI, -1.39 to -0.14), and -0.75 (95% CI, -1.47 to -0.02), respectively. Finally, the SMDs of acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, and lactate in IBD patients were -2.19 (95% CI, -3.98 to -0.39), -1.64 (95% CI, -3.02 to -0.25), -1.98 (95% CI, -3.93 to -0.03), -0.55 (95% CI, -0.93 to -0.18), and 4.02 (95% CI, 1.44 to 6.61), respectively.There were alterations of SCFAs in IBD patients, and inconsistent SCFA alterations were found in CD and UC.

Inactive rhomboid protein 2 (iRhom2) is essential for activating TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) in immune cells, which regulates TNF-α release. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of iRhom2 in intestinal inflammation in IBD.The expression of iRhom2 and TACE in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated COLO 205 and RAW 264.7 cells was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. The expression of iRhom2 and TACE in the colonic tissue of IBD patients and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  solution (TNBS)-treated mice was determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. To assess the role of iRhom2 in intestinal inflammation,  was induced in wild-type and iRhom2-/- mice by the administration of TNBS enema.In LPS-stimulated COLO 205 and RAW 264.7 cells, the mRNA and protein levels of TACE and iRhom2 were upregulated. The expression of TACE and iRhom2 in the colon of the IBD patients and TNBS-treated mice was significantly enhanced. The inflammatory cells that expressed high levels of iRhom2 in the colon were identified as macrophages. Finally, iRhom2 deficiency ameliorated TNBS-induced  by inhibiting TNF-α release.iRhom2 has an important role in intestinal inflammation through TNF-α secretion in immune cells, which suggests that iRhom2 could be a novel therapeutic target for IBD.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

It is challenging to find an absolute treatment and current therapy aims to ameliorate symptoms, decrease relapses and prevent prognosis of colorectal cancer. In the present study, we investigated the possible action of xanthine oxidase inhibitors in murine  model by measuring different indicative parameters and comparing the results to those of the reference sulfasalazine. Also, we compared the effects of combining sulfasalazine and allopurinol to each drug alone.

Rats in the normal group received no treatment. Rats in the model group were used to establish a UC model. Meanwhile, rats in the inhibitor group underwent intraperitoneal injection of inhibitor and establishment of the UC model. Subsequently, specimens were obtained for detection. Immunohistochemistry was applied to measure the expression of mTOR. Western blotting was adopted to determine the relative protein expressions of P85, P110 and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to detect the mRNA expression of miR-223. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was utilized to determine cell apoptosis. Furthermore, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to measure the content of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-6.Immunohistochemistry showed that the positive expression of mTOR increased remarkably in the model group and inhibitor group when compared with that of the normal group (p<0.05). However, it decreased notably in the inhibitor group when compared with the model group (p<0.05). Western blotting indicated that the protein expressions of P85, P110 and p-Akt in model group and inhibitor group were significantly higher than the ones of the normal group (p<0.05). However, the inhibitor group showed markedly lower relative protein expressions of P85, P110 and p-Akt than the ones of the model group (p<0.05). Compared with the normal group, the expression level of miR-223 was significantly elevated in model group and inhibitor group (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the mRNA expression of miR-233 between the model group and the inhibitor group (p>0.05). The apoptosis rate of the cells increased prominently in the model group and in the inhibitor group when compared with the normal group (p<0.05). However, it was remarkably reduced in the inhibitor group than the model group (p<0.05). In comparison with the normal group, the content of IL-1β and IL-6 was significantly up-regulated in the model group and in the inhibitor group (p<0.05). However, it declined notably in the inhibitor group compared with the model group (p<0.05).MiR-223 can trigger cell apoptosis and inflammation in UC by up-regulating the PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633040>Surveillance for colorectal cancer and chemoprevention in ulcerative and Crohn's : The need for clinical strategies to increase effectiveness.</a></h1><p>This review considers why current strategies for surveillance and the prevention of colorectal cancer as a long-term complication are ineffective.

Currently, the evidence in support of ursodeoxycholic  is mixed, and it cannot be recommended, in general, to patients for the prophylaxis of colorectal cancer risk. An alternative approach through better concordance with medications is considered. The situation in Crohn's  is less clear. Although the risk of colorectal cancer mirrors that in ulcerative , there are no published community-based studies that exclusively assess the effects of surveillance on the early detection of cancer, and the benefits of 5-ASA compounds in treatment seem less certain than in ulcerative . In addition, there have been no assessments of the effects of any medications on cancer risk in Crohn's disease.© 2019 The Authors.

Accordingly, elucidating this metabolic network is critical for understanding how the gut microbiota contributes to health and disease. Bile , which are first biosynthesized in the liver, are modified in the gut by enzymes expressed by commensal bacteria into secondary bile , which regulate myriad host processes, including lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, and immune homeostasis. The gateway reaction of secondary bile  biosynthesis is mediated by bile salt hydrolases (BSHs), bacterial cysteine hydrolases whose action precedes other bile  modifications within the gut. To assess how changes in bile  metabolism mediated by certain intestinal microbiota impact gut physiology and pathobiology, methods are needed to directly examine the activities of BSHs because they are master regulators of intestinal bile  metabolism. Here, we developed chemoproteomic tools to profile changes in gut microbiome-associated BSH activity. We showed that these probes can label active BSHs in model microorganisms, including relevant gut anaerobes, and in mouse gut microbiomes. Using these tools, we identified altered BSH activities in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease, in this case,  induced by dextran sodium sulfate, leading to changes in bile  metabolism that could impact host metabolism and immunity. Importantly, our findings reveal that alterations in BSH enzymatic activities within the gut microbiome do not correlate with changes in gene abundance as determined by metagenomic sequencing, highlighting the utility of chemoproteomic approaches for interrogating the metabolic activities of the gut microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351432>Therapeutic effectiveness of rectally administered fish oil and mesalazine in trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced .</a></h1><p>Fish oil (FO) and mesalazine have well-known anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects; on the other hand, information related to combined intrarectal administration of FO and mesalazine is limited.

This work aims to investigate the effect of milk phospholipids (MP) on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced  of C57BL/6 mice, compared with soybean phospholipids (SP), as well as the related mechanism. We found that unlike SP, MP supplementation (25 mg per kg BW) had a unique beneficial effect on the 2.5% DSS induced  (p < 0.05) and ameliorated the injury status of goblet cells, indicated by the increased number (p < 0.05) and size (p < 0.05) of the goblet cells and more  mucins and antimicrobial peptides (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, MP supplementation restored the over-activated Notch pathway through balancing the level of Notch pathway ligand Dll4 in the colon subepithelial layer (p < 0.05), thus leading to the increase in the Math1 expression (p < 0.05), and consequently enhanced goblet cell restitution (p < 0.05). Furthermore, MP induced more goblet cells in the colonoid and colonic myofibroblast co-culture system (p < 0.05), which highlighted the indispensable role of colonic myofibroblasts, as an intestinal stem cell niche factor, in the goblet cell modulation effect of MP. These findings indicated that phospholipids from milk instead of soybean attenuated the severity of DSS-induced mouse  and prevented the depletion of colonic goblet cells through balancing the over-activated Notch pathway mediated by colonic myofibroblasts.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31158441>Onion bulb extract reduces  severity in mice via modulation of colonic inflammatory pathways and the apoptotic machinery.</a></h1><p>The use of nutraceutical-based products has increased in recent years due to their demonstrated efficacy and their good safety profile. Onion is one of the most commonly used plants in the traditional medicine for the management of various conditions including inflammatory and gastrointestinal diseases. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effects of onion particularly in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).To test the anti-inflammatory effects of onion bulb extract (OBE) in an IBD mouse model and the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects such as modulation of the expression and/or the activity profile of various pro-inflammatory molecules. was induced in mice by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) daily administration for 5 days. Animals were sacrificed, colons were removed and the severity of the inflammation was determined by the gross and histological assessments. The colonic level/activity of various cytokines and chemokines were measured using proteome profiling-based assay, western blotting, and immunofluorescence techniques.DSS-induced  was significantly reduced by the daily OBE treatment and 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA, positive control), particularly at 100-200 mg/kg doses, at both the gross and histological levels. OBE was also shown to reduce colonic expression and activity of several pro-inflammatory molecules and signaling pathways, such as mitogen activated protein kinase family, mammalian target of rapamycin, cyclooxygenase-2, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. In addition, OBE reduced the expression of interferon-γ, various C-C and C-X-C chemokines, and molecules involved in the apoptotic machinery such as cytochrome c, caspase-3 and -8, B-cell lymphoma-extra-large and -2.OBE showed anti-inflammatory actions in IBD mouse model, which is attributed, in part, to the modulation of the expression and the activity of important pro-inflammatory molecules and signaling pathways involved in the inflammatory response. These data suggest that OBE may be a promising lead in the therapeutic management of IBD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

By the end of the follow-up, 37 patients (28%) relapsed after a median time of 3.9 years (1.2; 5.0) since diagnosis, without significant difference between CC and LC (30% vs 26%; P = 0.47). Twenty patients (15%) were hospitalized for a disease flare, and 32 patients (25%) presented another autoimmune disease. Budesonide was the most widely used treatment (n = 74, 59%), followed by 5-aminosalicylic  (n = 31, 25%). The median duration of budesonide treatment was 92 days (70; 168), and no adverse event to budesonide was reported. Sixteen patients (22%) developed steroid dependency and 4 (5%) were corticoresistant. No difference in the risk of digestive and extradigestive cancer was observed compared with the general population. None of the death (n = 25) observed during the follow-up were linked to MC. In multivariate analysis, age at diagnosis (HR, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.06; P = 0.02) and budesonide exposure (HR, 2.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-5.55; P = 0.03) were significantly associated with relapse.This population-based study showed that after diagnosis, two-third of the patients with MC observed long-term clinical remission. Age at diagnosis and budesonide exposure were associated with a risk of relapse.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201771>Anti-VCAM 1 Antibody-Coated Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Attenuate Experimental  via Immunomodulation.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUND The treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still not satisfactory and novel technologies are clinically needed. This study aimed to examine the effect of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) coated with the anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM 1) antibody on experimental . MATERIAL AND METHODS The antibody was coated onto the MSCs isolated from male BALB/C mice to generate anti-VCAM 1 antibody-coated MSC (V-MSC). The Transwell assay was used to detect migration rate. 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) was used to generate experimental . MSCs were injected intravenously into experimental models. Weight changes, disease activity index, and histological changes were evaluated. The SRY gene were used for cell tracking. Expression of Ki67 and claudin 1 was used to measure local repair using immunohistochemistry. T helper (Th)1, Th2, Th17, and T regulatory cells were counted. RESULTS V-MSCs were successfully generated through coating MSCs with VCAM1 antibody. Analysis showed that the V-MSCs had similar surface types and differentiation as uncoated MSCs. Transwell assays showed that V-MSCs had higher migration rate than MSCs. After injection of V-MSCs, the expression of the SRY gene was enhanced in diseased colon and all indices (including weight changes, DAI score, histological changes, and the expressions of Ki67 and claudin 1) recovered rapidly. The ratio of proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells decreased, but the ratio of anti-inflammatory Th2 and Treg cells increased after the treatment. CONCLUSIONS V-MSCs enhance homing and modulating immune balance in the experimental , suggesting that they are potentially useful for treating inflammatory bowel disease or other immune diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257292>Preparation of Chondroitin Sulfate-Glycyl-Prednisolone Conjugate Nanogel and Its Efficacy in Rats with Ulcerative .</a></h1><p>A conjugate between chondroitin sulfate (CS) and glycyl-prednisolone (GP), named CS-GP, was produced by carbodiimide coupling at a high GP/CS ratio. CS-GP was not water-soluble and gave a nanogel (NG) in aqueous solution. Two types of nanogels, NG(I) and NG(II), with prednisolone (PD) contents of 5.5 and 21.1% (w/w), respectively, were obtained. They had particle sizes of approximately 280 and 570 nm, respectively, and showed negative ζ-potentials of approximately -40 mV. The PD release rate was slower in the nanogels than in a solution of CS-GP with a PD content of 1.4% (w/w). The PD release rate was slower in NG(II) than in NG(I), and was elevated at pH 7.4 than at pH 6.8. NG(II) was applied in vivo to rats with trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced , and its therapeutic efficacy and pharmacokinetic features were investigated. The therapeutic efficacy of NG(II) was slightly better than that of PD alone. Drug delivery to the lower intestines was enhanced with NG(II).

A critical PUFA, arachidonic  (ARA), is metabolized to a diverse set of lipids signaling molecules through cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, or cytochrome P450 hydroxylase; however, the majority of ARA is metabolized into anti-inflammatory epoxides  cytochrome P450 enzymes. These short-lived epoxide lipids are rapidly metabolized or inactivated by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) into diol-containing products. sEH inhibition or knockout has been a practical approach to study the biology of the epoxide lipids, and has been shown to effectively treat inflammatory conditions in the preclinical models including gastrointestinal ulcers and  by shifting oxylipins to epoxide profiles, inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration and activation, and enhancing epithelial cell defense  increased mucin production, thus providing further evidence for the role of sEH as a pro-inflammatory protein. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with COX-inhibitor activity are among the most commonly used analgesics and have demonstrated applications in the management of cardiovascular disease and intriguingly cancer. Major side effects of NSAIDs however are gastrointestinal ulcers which frequently precludes their long-term application. In this review, we hope to bridge the gap between NSAID toxicity and sEH-mediated metabolic pathways to focus on the role of epoxy fatty  metabolic pathway of PUFAs in NSAIDS-ulcer formation and healing as well as inflammation-related carcinogenesis. Specifically we address the potential application of sEH inhibition to enhance ulcer healing at the site of inflammation  their activity on altered lipid signaling, mitochondrial function, and diminished reactive oxygen species, and further discuss the significance of dual COX and sEH inhibitor in anti-inflammation and carcinogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382518>Serum Bile  Profiling in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Treated with Anti-TNFs.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), ulcerative  (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD), represent systematic chronic conditions with a deficient intestinal absorption. We first attempt to investigate the serum bile  (sBAs) profile in a large cohort of IBD patients to evaluate changes under anti-TNF alpha treatment.Forty CD and 40 UC patients were enrolled and BAs were quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ES-MS/MS). Up to 15 different sBAs concentrations and clinical biomarkers where added to a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to discriminate IBD from healthy conditions and treatment.PCA allowed a separation into two clusters within CD (biologic-free patients and patients treated with anti-TNF alpha drugs and healthy subjects) but not UC. The first included CD. CD patients receiving anti-TNF alpha have an increase in total sBAs (4.11 1.23 μM) compared to patients not exposed. Secondary BAs significantly increase after anti-TNF alpha treatment (1.54 0.83 μM). Furthermore, multivariate analysis based on sBA concentration highlighted a different qualitative sBAs profile for UC and CD patients treated with conventional therapy.According to our results, anti-TNF alpha in CD restores the sBA profile by re-establishing the physiological levels. These findings indicate that, secondary BAs might serve as an indirect biomarker of the healing process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31334133>Strain-Specific Anti-inflammatory Properties of Two  Strains on Chronic  in Mice.</a></h1><p> is potential probiotic in that its type strain ATCC BAA-835 has beneficial effects upon obesity and diabetes. However, whether  can improve inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which is a form of chronic intestinal dysbiosis, is unknown. Hence, we used an isolated murine  strain (designated 139) and  type strain ATCC, to investigate their anti-inflammatory properties in cell models and in Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-induced chronic  of mice. , the two  strains exerted similar anti-inflammatory properties as they both reduced IL-8 production by TNF-α-stimulated HT-29 cells. However, neither of the strains showed capacity to increase the differentiation of regulatory T (Treg)-cells from CD4+ T cell populations significantly. , both  strains exerted anti-inflammatory effects on chronic  as they improved clinical parameters including spleen weight, colon inflammation index, and colon histological score. They also down-regulated the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IFN-γ in the colon of mice. However, the anti-inflammatory effects of strain ATCC were stronger than strain 139 in that ATCC significantly reduced spleen weight, colon inflammation index, and fecal lipocalin-2 content in mice with chronic , while strain 139 was not. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota was observed in mice with chronic . Both  strains facilitated the normalization of the gut microbiota. The specific capacity of strain ATCC to modulate the differentiation of Tregs as well as increase production of short chain fatty , demonstrated strain-specific characteristics for these two  strains.

The present study was designed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of alosetron, a 5-HTR antagonist, on trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)-induced ulcerative  in rats. Two h subsequent to induce  (intracolonic instillation of TNBS, 50 mg/kg) in male Wistar rats, alosetron (1 mg/kg), dexamethasone (1 mg/kg), meta-chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG, a 5-HTR agonist, 5 mg/kg), or alosetron + mCPBG were administrated intraperitoneally for 6 days. Animals were thereafter sacrificed and the efficacy of drugs was evaluated macroscopically, histologically, and biochemically (myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1 beta) on distal colon samples. Treatment with alosetron and dexamethasone improved macroscopic and microscopic colonic damages significantly and decreased myeloperoxidase activity and colonic levels of inflammatory cytokines. The profitable effects of alosetron were antagonized by concurrent administration of mCPBG. Our data provided evidence that the protective effects of alosetron on TNBS-induced  can be mediated by 5- HT3R.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243807>Inflammatory bowel disease is associated with increased gut-to-blood penetration of short-chain fatty : A new, non-invasive marker of a functional intestinal lesion.</a></h1><p>What is the central question of this study? 'Leaky gut' has been found in intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. However, functional evaluation of intestinal permeability is not widely used as a diagnostic marker, possibly owing to significant limitations of currently used permeability assays. There is an unmet need for development of a new, non-invasive test to assess intestinal function. What is the main finding and its importance? We show that an increased blood-to-stool ratio of the concentration of gut bacteria-produced short-chain fatty  may be used as a marker of gut permeability. Our findings lay the groundwork for establishing a new, non-invasive, risk-free diagnostic tool in diseases associated with intestinal barrier malfunction, such as inflammatory bowel disease.Intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are characterized by an impaired gut-blood barrier commonly referred to as 'leaky gut'. Therefore, functional evaluation of the gut-blood barrier is a promising diagnostic marker. We hypothesized that short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) produced by gut bacteria might serve as a marker in IBD. Animal experiments were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats with acetic -induced  and in sham control animals. The gut-blood barrier permeability was determined by assessing the ratios of the following: (i) portal blood concentration of SCFAs (C ) to faecal concentration of SCFAs (C ); (ii) systemic blood concentration of SCFAs (C ) to faecal concentration of SCFAs (C ); and (iii) C and C of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran administered into the colon. As a clinical study, we evaluated C , C and the C /C ratio of SCFAs in six paediatric patients with IBD, assessed as mild/moderate/severe by the Paediatric Ulcerative  Activity Index (PUCAI) and the Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) at the time of sample collection, and nine age-matched healthy control subjects. Rats with histologically confirmed IBD had significantly increased ratios of C /C and C /C for SCFAs. This was positively correlated with the plasma FITC-dextran concentration. Likewise, IBD patients showed a significantly higher C /C ratio for SCFAs, including acetic, valeric, isocaproic, caproic and propionic , in comparison to control subjects. In conclusion, in the rats and in paediatric patients with IBD we found an increased blood-to-stool ratio of SCFAs, suggesting an increased gut-to-blood penetration of SCFAs. These findings pave the way for a new, non-invasive diagnostic tool in IBD and other diseases accompanied by intestinal barrier malfunction.© 2019 The Authors.

Patients with UC usually suffer from a lifetime of debilitating physical symptoms. Therefore, developing effective therapeutic strategy that can manage this disease better and improve patients' life quality is in urgent need. Sesamin (SSM) is a lignan derived from sesame seeds. In this study, the protective effect of SSM against UC and the underlying mechanism were investigated  and . Our data showed that SSM protected Caco-2 cells from HO-induced oxidative stress injury via GSH-mediated scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was significantly increased by SSM, and the ability of SSM to activate Nrf2-targeted genes was further confirmed in Caco-2 cells using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In contrast, Nrf2 knockdown abolished the protective effect of SSM. Additionally, we found that SSM also activated advanced protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in Caco-2 cells, while either AKT or ERK inhibition can prevent SSM-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, SSM displayed a better protective effect against dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced UC compared with 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) in C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced Nrf2 signaling and activated AKT/ERK were also observed in the colon of mice after SSM administration. These results first demonstrate the protective effect of SSM against UC and indicate that the effect is associated with AKT/ERK activation and subsequent Nrf2 signaling enhancement. This study provides a new insight into the medicinal value of SSM and proposes it as a new natural nutrition for better managing the symptoms of UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673529>Expression of CXC Chemokine Receptors in Acute Ulcerative : Initial Study from an Animal Model.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative  (UC) is an inflammatory disease which is characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells, crypt abscesses, distortion of the mucosal glands, and goblet cell depletion. The existence of neutrophil-rich inflammation in colon tissues of patients with UC is one of the most significant histological features of this disease. Nonetheless, the expression of CXCR chemokine receptors which appear as the main chemical mediators governing the migration of neutrophils into the mucosal tissue of patients with UC has not been well clarified.In this experimental study, the UC model was induced in Wistar rats by administration of 2 ml 4% acetic  into the large colon through the rectum. Animals were anesthetized after 48 h; their colon tissue samples were isolated for macroscopic and histopathological examination. The expression of receptor of CXC chemokine was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique.Heavy infiltration of neutrophils, coagulative necrosis, and ulcers were observed in H and E staining, which pathologically proved the UC model. qRT-PCR results indicated that CXCR2 as one of the important ELR chemokine family receptors bears the highest expression in the UC group (32 fold) than the control group ( ≤ 0.05). In addition, other CXCRs of this group including CXCR1 did not possess any change ( > 0.05). In contrast, RLR negative chemokine family receptors did not show any changes with the normal group.The results showed that CXCR2 is the only receptor for CXCL family which was remarkably upregulated in experimental UC and that CXCR2 might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC.Copyright: © 2019 Advanced Biomedical Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504527>Application of Herbaceous Medications for Inflammatory Bowel Disease as a Complementary and Alternative Therapy.</a></h1><p>Conventional medicine for the treatment of IBD is prevailingly composed of sulfadiazine, 5-aminosalicylic , glucocorticoid, and immunosuppressants, which have the merits of alleviating intestine inflammation, but long-term use of these drugs may cause toxic side effects; additionally, these drugs may be expensive. In the pursuit of novel and more economic therapies, patients may increasingly look at complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Recently, CAM is increasingly favored by the general public on account of its safety, low toxicity, and effectiveness. As a branch of CAM, herbal plants and their extracts have a significant effect on the treatment of IBD. Treatment of IBD with herbaceous plants has been reported, but specific mechanisms and effects have not yet been elaborated.English abstracts were identified in PubMed and Science Direct by multiple search terms, such as "herbal," "CAM," "IBD," "ulcerative ," "abdominal pain," and so on. Full-length articles were selected for review.Herbaceous plants and their extracts have been shown to be effective against IBD in many studies, and herbaceous plants may be effective in treating symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, mucus, and bloody stools.Herbal medications could be used as a complementary and alternative treatment for IBD, but they require more rigorous scientific testing.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Nephrotoxicity risk analysis was a first recorded renal impairment diagnosis adjusted for key variables and was assessed between 2008 and 2017.A total of 35 601 patients with prevalent UC or CD were included. The proportion of patients prescribed 5-aminosalicylates fell from 83% in 1996-1999 to 71% in 2012-2015 for UC patients and 64% to 45% for CD patients. Thirty per cent of patients had prolonged 5-aminosalicylate use. Between 2008 and 2017, the incident rate of nephrotoxicity was similar and stable for UC (12.6/1000 person-years) and CD (10.9/1000 person-years) patients. Multivariate analysis showed no evidence for association between current prescription of 5-aminosalicylate and nephrotoxicity in UC or CD patients, comparing ≤ 30 days prescription prior to index vs 31-≤180 days. However, active disease, disease duration, concomitant cardiovascular disease or diabetes and nephrotoxic drug use were independently associated with development of nephrotoxicity in UC and CD.Despite the paucity of evidence for their benefit, 5-aminosalicylates were prescribed to approximately half of CD patients (30% prolonged therapy). Nephrotoxicity was rare in this patient cohort, and was not associated with 5-aminosalicylate use, but rather with disease status, comorbidity and use of nephrotoxic drugs.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524230>Complex TNF-α B cell epitope MAP vaccine alleviates murine ulcerative .</a></h1><p>The present study aimed to develop a tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α) B‑cell epitope/IL‑1β helper T lymphocyte epitope complex MAP vaccine for the alleviation of ulcerative  (UC) in mice. The B cell epitopes of murine TNF‑α (mTNF‑α) were predicted in silico and coupled with the universal interleukin 1β (IL‑1β) helper T‑cell epitope peptide VQGEESNDK to synthesize the eight‑branched MAP vaccine. Then, the immunological effects of the MAP vaccine were assessed in vitro and in vivo, as well as its impacts on DAI index, serum DAO levels, colon tissue tight junction protein amounts, ultrastructural changes, and MPO activity in BALB/c mice with UC. The amino  LTLRSSSQNSSDKPV at positions 78‑92 of mTNF‑α may constitute the dominant B cell epitope. Based on this finding, an eight‑branched peptide structure, the TNF‑α B‑cell epitope/IL‑1β helper T‑cell epitope complex MAP vaccine, was synthesized. Indirect ELISA confirmed that MAP had a high affinity with commercialized mTNF‑α antibodies. Meanwhile, MAP induced high specific antibody titers in vivo, reduced the DAI score, serum MPO activity, colorectal lymph node colony count, ultrastructural injuries, colon tissue histological index score and MPO activity in UC mice, while increasing the expression levels of occludin, claudin1 and ZO1 in colon tissues.

In this study, we investigated the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of experimental  in mice. Relative to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD), HFD feeding for 4 wk increased the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty  in the plasma as well as within the colonic mucosa. In an experimental  model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS), mice on 4-wk HFD exhibited more severe colonic inflammation and developed more severe  compared with the LFD counterparts. HFD feeding resulted in higher production of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokines, greater activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) tight junction regulatory pathway, and greater increases in mucosal barrier permeability in mice following TNBS induction. HFD feeding also induced gp91, an NADPH oxidase subunit, and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both colonic epithelial cells and lamina propria cells. In HCT116 cell culture, palmitic  or palmitic  and TNF-α combination markedly increased ROS production and induced the MLCK pathway, and these effects were markedly diminished in the presence of a ROS scavenger. Taken together, these data suggest that HFD promotes  by aggravating mucosal oxidative stress, which rapidly drives mucosal inflammation and increases intestinal mucosal barrier permeability. This study demonstrates high-fat diet feeding promotes  in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced experimental  model in mice. The underlying mechanism is that high-fat diet induces oxidative stress in the colonic mucosa, which increases colonic epithelial barrier permeability and drives colonic mucosal inflammation.

This study was directed to explore the prophylactic effect of  fruit peel extract against irradiation-induced  in rats. GC/MS analysis of the petroleum ether extract led to recognition of 33 compounds in the unsaponifiable fraction and 15 fatty  methyl esters in the saponifiable part. Thirteen terpenes and sterols were isolated and identified from which ten compounds were not isolated from any part of this species before. Data showed that irradiation induced colon injury as manifested by elevated contents of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, myeloperoxidase, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, cyclooxygenase-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and nuclear factor kappa B, while it reduced superoxide dismutase activity and interleukin 10 content in colonic tissues, which was confirmed by histopathological examination. Pretreatment with  extract attenuated the alteration in the measured parameters.

Long-term UC remission has shed light on the necessity of modified therapeutic strategies. In this study, UC was induced in rats by intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS). The anticolitis effect of methylene blue (MB), a well-known dye and antioxidant and a potent mitochondrial enhancer was tested. MB was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg, and colosalazine was administered orally (p.o.) at a dose of 500 mg/kg 11 days after the administration of TNBS, which was injected on the 8th day. All treatment group results were compared to the TNBS group results. Macroscopically, limited body weight loss and decrease in the colon weight per unit length ratio were observed in the MB groups. MB improved histological damage and decreased the expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and accumulation of CD4 lymphocytes observed by immunohistochemistry. Downregulation of Bax/Bcl protein expression was detected using Western blotting, and increased mRNA expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was measured by qPCR. MB produced biochemical alterations, such as significant decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-17 (IL-17) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Significant decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels as well as significant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase levels were observed with MB, and these effects were similar to those produced by colosalazine. Thus, MB altered disease pathogenesis and could be a promising and challenging therapeutic target for UC treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542404>Enhancement of epithelial cell autophagy induced by sinensetin alleviates epithelial barrier dysfunction in .</a></h1><p>Intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction is a key pathology of .

The levels of colonic inflammation and intestinal mucosal inflammatory mediators IL-1β and TNF-α were significantly lower while IL-10 was significantly higher in PCB2 group than in the model group ( &lt; 0.05). Compared with those in the model group, the mice in PCB2 treatment group showed a significantly lower positive rate of bacterial translocation in the mesenteric lymph nodes and a lower thiocyanate-dextran permeability of the intestinal mucosa ( &lt; 0.05). Western blotting showed that PCB2 treatment significantly increased the expressions of claudin-1 and ZO-1 ( &lt; 0.05) and significantly lowered the expression levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT in the intestinal mucosa as compared with those in the model group ( &lt; 0.05).PCB2 suppresses intestinal inflammation and protects intestinal mucosal functions and structural integrity by inhibiting intestinal PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suggesting the potential of PCB2 as a new drug for Crohn's disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469656>Exploring the therapeutic potential of sodium benzoate in acetic -induced ulcerative  in rats.</a></h1><p>Background Ulcerative  is a chronic mucosal inflammation of the large intestine mainly affecting the colon and rectum. The lack of effective and safe therapeutic agents led to the identification of new therapeutic agents to effectively manage the symptoms and complications of ulcerative . The present study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of sodium benzoate in acetic -induced ulcerative  in rats. Methods Infusion of 3% acetic  in the colon through the rectum was done to construct a rat model of ulcerative . After 5 days of infusion, macroscopic, biochemical, and histopathological examinations and disease activity scoring of the colon were done to assess colonic damage. Results Acetic  infusion resulted in severe inflammation in the colon assessed macroscopically and histopathologically. Moreover, it also led to increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) and reduction in glutathione (GSH) levels. In the present study, repeated administration of sodium benzoate (400 and 800 mg/kg i.p.) and sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg orally) for 7 days, i.e. 2 days before and continued for 5 days after acetic  infusion, significantly attenuated macroscopic damage and disease activity score as compared to disease control. Further, it also significantly reduced the levels of MPO and enhanced colonic levels of reduced GSH. However, the lower dose of sodium benzoate (200 mg/kg) did not show sufficient protective effect in acetic -induced ulcerative . Further, sodium benzoate per se did not show any effect in normal rats. Conclusions The observed protective effect of sodium benzoate may be due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in an ulcerative  model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31137456>Dietary Walnut Supplementation Alters Mucosal Metabolite Profiles During DSS-Induced Colonic Ulceration.</a></h1><p>Walnuts contain a complex array of natural compounds and phytochemicals that exhibit a wide range of health benefits, including protection against inflammation and colon cancer. In this study, we assess the effects of dietary supplementation with walnuts on colonic mucosal injury induced in mice by the ulcerogenic agent, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). C57Bl/6J mice were started on the Total Western Diet supplemented with freshly-ground whole walnuts (0, 3.5, 7 and 14% g/kg) 2 weeks prior to a 5-day DSS treatment and walnut diets were continued throughout the entire experimental period. Mice were examined at 2 days or 10 days after withdrawal of DSS. In a separate study, a discovery-based metabolite profiling analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed on fecal samples and colonic mucosa following two weeks of walnut supplementation. Dietary walnut supplementation showed significant effects in the 10-day post-DSS recovery-phase study, in which the extent of ulceration was significantly reduced (7.5% vs. 0.3%,  < 0.05) with 14% walnuts. In the metabolite-profiling analysis, walnuts caused a significant increase in several polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs), including docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and 9-oxo-10(E),12(E)-octadecadienoic  (9-oxoODA), as well as kynurenic . In colon tissue samples, walnuts caused a significant increase in the levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and betaine, important components of fatty  β-oxidation. These metabolite changes may contribute in part to the observed protection against DSS-induced inflammatory tissue injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621721>Intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei A.

Natural products derived from plants that are rich in bioactive compounds are used by many patients with IBD. Xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei) is a cactus of the Caatinga family that has been used by the local population for food and medicinal purposes. The intestinal anti-inflammatory effect of xique-xique cladode juice was evaluated in the present study. A dose of 5 mL kg-1 had a protective effect on intestinal inflammation, with an improvement in macroscopic damage, and a decrease in pro-inflammatory markers and oxidative stress, in addition to preserving the colonic tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the downregulation of IL-17, NF-κB, and iNOS, and upregulation of SOCs-1, ZO-1, and MUC-2. These protective effects could be attributed to the phenolic compounds as well as the fibers present in xique-xique juice. Further studies are needed before suggesting the use of xique-xique juice as a new alternative for treating IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31238939>Mucosal delivery of Lactococcus lactis carrying an anti-TNF scFv expression vector ameliorates experimental  in mice.</a></h1><p>Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha therapy has become clinically important for treating inflammatory bowel disease. However, the use of conventional immunotherapy requires a systemic exposure of patients and collateral side effects. Lactic  bacteria have been shown to be effective as mucosal delivering system for cytokine and single domain antibodies, and it is amenable to clinical purposes. Therefore, lactic  bacteria may function as vehicles for delivery of therapeutic antibodies molecules to the gastrointestinal tract restricting the pharmacological effect towards the gut. Here, we use the mucosal delivery of Lactococcus lactis carrying an anti-TNFα scFv expression plasmid on a DSS-induced  model in mice.Experimental  was induced with DSS administered in drinking water. L. lactis carrying the scFv expression vector was introduced by gavage. After four days of treatment, animals showed a significant improvement in histological score and disease activity index compared to those of untreated animals. Moreover, treated mice display IL-6, IL17A, IL1β, IL10 and FOXP3 mRNA levels similar to health control mice. Therefore, morphological and molecular markers suggest amelioration of the experimentally induced .These results provide evidence for the use of this alternative system for delivering therapeutic biopharmaceuticals in loco for treating inflammatory bowel disease, paving the way for a novel low-cost and site-specific biotechnological route for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672153>Effect of Enterococcus faecalis 2001 on  and depressive-like behavior in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice: involvement of the brain-gut axis.</a></h1><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including those with ulcerative  and Crohn's disease, have higher rates of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety; however, the mechanism of psychiatric disorder development remains unclear. Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic  bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest a close relationship between IBD and depression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31248978>Experimental  Enhances the Rate of Antinociceptive Tolerance to Morphine via Peripheral Opioid Receptors.</a></h1><p>Opioids are highly effective analgesics, however, their therapeutic use is limited by adverse effects that include respiratory depression, dependence, and tolerance. Inflammation has been implicated as a significant driver for the development of tolerance to opioids. Recent studies show that chronic morphine in mice results in gut microbial dysbiosis and inflammation in the colon. In the present study, we examined whether colonic inflammation results in tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine. Colonic inflammation was induced in mice by intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitro-benzene sulfonic . The development of antinociceptive tolerance was determined by warm-water tail-immersion assay in mice implanted with 25-, 50-, or 75-mg morphine pellet. Colonic inflammation significantly enhanced the rate at which tolerance developed in each cohort of chronic morphine-treated mice. At the lowest dose of morphine pellet (25 mg), antinociceptive tolerance only developed in the presence of colonic inflammation, whereas in 50- and 75-mg pelleted mice, tolerance developed faster in the inflamed animals than in the noninflamed mice. The enhanced antinociceptive tolerance was attenuated with daily administration of peripheral opioid receptor antagonist, 6--heterocyclic-substituted naltrexamine derivative [17-cyclopropylmethyl-3,14-dihydroxy-4,5-epoxy-6-[(4'pyridyl)acetamido]morphinan (NAP)], irrespective of colonic inflammation. Collectively, these findings show that the rate of tolerance to morphine antinociception is exaggerated in the presence of colonic inflammation, and tolerance is prevented by a peripheral -opioid receptor antagonist. These studies suggest a peripheral component to the development of antinociceptive tolerance to opioids. Furthermore, peripherally selective opioid antagonists may be useful adjuncts in opioid-based pain management. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study supports the notion that inflammation influences the development of antinociceptive tolerance to chronic morphine exposure. We found that, in the presence of colonic inflammation, the rate of development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine increased. We also found that treatment with a peripheral opioid receptor antagonist prevented morphine antinociceptive tolerance. Increasing opioid intake during an inflammatory state would result in decreased analgesia and enhanced analgesic tolerance, which puts patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, inflammatory joint diseases, and sickle cell anemia at risk for heavy opioid use.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220352>Neuroinflammation in Murine Cirrhosis Is Dependent on the Gut Microbiome and Is Attenuated by Fecal Transplant.</a></h1><p>Cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with an altered gut-liver-brain axis. Fecal microbial transplant (FMT) after antibiotics improves outcomes in HE, but the impact on brain function is unclear. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of colonization using human donors in germ-free (GF) mice on the gut-liver-brain axis. GF and conventional mice were made cirrhotic using carbon tetrachloride and compared with controls in GF and conventional state. Additional GF mice were colonized with stool from controls (Ctrl-Hum) and patients with cirrhosis (Cirr-Hum). Stools from patients with HE cirrhosis after antibiotics were pooled (pre-FMT). Stools from the same patients 15 days after FMT from a healthy donor were also pooled (post-FMT). Sterile supernatants were created from pre-FMT and post-FMT samples. GF mice were colonized using stools/sterile supernatants. For all mice, frontal cortex, liver, and small/large intestines were collected. Cortical inflammation, synaptic plasticity and gamma-aminobutyric  (GABA) signaling, and liver inflammation and intestinal 16s ribosomal RNA microbiota sequencing were performed. Conventional cirrhotic mice had higher degrees of neuroinflammation, microglial/glial activation, GABA signaling, and intestinal dysbiosis compared with other groups. Cirr-Hum mice had greater neuroinflammation, microglial/glial activation, and GABA signaling and lower synaptic plasticity compared with Ctrl-Hum mice. This was associated with greater dysbiosis but no change in liver histology. Pre-FMT material colonization was associated with neuroinflammation and microglial activation and dysbiosis, which was reduced significantly with post-FMT samples. Sterile pre-FMT and post-FMT supernatants did not affect brain parameters. Liver inflammation was unaffected. Conclusion: Fecal microbial colonization from patients with cirrhosis results in higher degrees of neuroinflammation and activation of GABAergic and neuronal activation in mice regardless of cirrhosis compared with those from healthy humans. Reduction in neuroinflammation by using samples from post-FMT patients to colonize GF mice shows a direct effect of fecal microbiota independent of active liver inflammation or injury.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211831>Intestinal Inflammation Modulates the Epithelial Response to Butyrate in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Butyrate-producing gut bacteria are reduced in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), supporting the hypothesis that butyrate supplementation may be beneficial in this setting. Nonetheless, earlier studies suggest that the oxidation of butyrate in IBD patients is altered. We propose that inflammation may decrease epithelial butyrate consumption.Non-IBD controls and IBD patients were recruited for the study. Stool samples were used for short-chain fatty  and bacterial butyryl CoA:acetate CoA-transferase quantification. Colonic biopsies and ex vivo differentiated epithelial organoids (d-EpOCs) treated with butyrate and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were used for analyzing the expression of transporters MCT1 and ABCG2, metabolic enzyme ACADS, and butyrate receptor GPR43, and for butyrate metabolism and consumption assays.We observed that lower stool content of butyrate-producing bacteria in active IBD patients did not correlate with decreased butyrate concentrations. Indeed, the intestinal epithelial expression of MCT1, ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 was altered in active IBD patients. Nonetheless, d-EpOCs derived from IBD patients showed SLC16A1 (gene encoding for MCT1 protein), ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 expression levels comparable to controls. Moreover, IBD- and non-IBD-derived d-EpOCs responded similarly to butyrate, as assessed by transcriptional regulation. TNFα significantly altered SLC16A1, ABCG2, and GPR43 transcription in d-EpOCs, mimicking the expression profile observed in biopsies from active IBD patients and resulting in reduced butyrate consumption.We provide evidence that the response to butyrate is not intrinsically altered in IBD patients. However, TNFα renders the epithelium less responsive to this metabolite, defeating the purpose of butyrate supplementation during active inflammation.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

The effects of chlorogenic  on UC were evaluated by colon mucosa damage index (CMDI), HE staining, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and Western blot. The relationship between chlorogenic  and MAPK/ERK/JNK signaling pathway was explored by adding ERK inhibitor.The UC models were established successfully by drinking DSS water. Chlorogenic  reduces DSS-induced colonic mucosal damage, inhibits DSS-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in colon, and reduces ERK1/2, p -ERK, p38, p-p38, JNK, and p-JNK protein expression. ERK inhibitor U0126 reversed the protective effect of chlorogenic  on colon tissue.Chlorogenic  can alleviate DSS-induced ulcerative  in mice, which can significantly reduce tissue inflammation and apoptosis, and its mechanism is related to the MAPK/ERK/JNK signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410747>Jasonia glutinosa (L.)

DC., known as rock tea (RT), is traditionally used in Spain as a digestive due to its beneficial properties in bowel disorders. The pharmacological nature of these properties has not been established yet. The aim of this work was to evaluate the therapeutic utility of RT in experimental  and to identify chemical constituents with anti-inflammatory and/or anti-oxidative properties. RT extract was prepared with ethanol in a Soxhlet apparatus and analysed by HPLC-DAD. Superoxide radical scavenging properties, xanthine oxidase and lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitory activity, and capability to lower nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels were measured in cell-free and cell-based assays. In the 2.5%-dextran-sodium sulphate (DSS) injury-repair model of ulcerative  (UC), mice were daily treated with sulfasalazine (SSZ, as reference drug, 100 mg/kg bw), RT (5, 25 and 50 mg/kg bw, p.o.), or vehicle over 20 days.  was scored daily. Colon samples were examined macroscopically and histopathologically. Protein levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukins 6, and 10 (IL-6, IL-10), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were studied as markers of oxidative stress and inflammatory activity. The integrity of the apical epithelial layer was assessed by immunofluorescence staining of zonula ocludens-1 (ZO-1). Finally, intestinal contractility was also evaluated by isometric myography. Fifteen phenolic compounds and three pigments were identified and quantified, of which caffeoylquinic , and the flavonoid, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, were the most abundant. RT extract significantly scavenged superoxide radicals, inhibited 5-LOX activity, and lowered NO and TNF-α levels. DSS-treated mice receiving RT scored clinically lower than controls during the first 3 days of DSS treatment and during the recovery period. SSZ was less effective than RT. Anatomical and histological examination of colon samples revealed that RT significantly prevented colon shortening, increased colon thickness, and lowered the macroscopic damage score. RT also significantly prevented the increase of MPO activity, IL-6 levels, iNOS and COX-2 expression, the loss of ZO-1 apical expression, and normalized contractility disturbances. In conclusion, daily administration of RT showed therapeutic properties in the DSS-model of UC. The benefits of RT can likely be attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant phenolic and flavonoid constituents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400959>Electroacupuncture relieved visceral and referred hindpaw hypersensitivity in  rats by inhibiting tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia.</a></h1><p>Irritable bowel syndrome patients frequently complain of pain in body regions somatotopically distinct from the gut, suggesting the involvement of an exaggerated signaling process in both visceral and somatic sensory pathways. Increasing evidence has shown that sprouting of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH-IR) fibers toward sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia maintains and exacerbates the neuropathic and inflammatory pain, as well as colonic inflammation. The aim of the present study was to determine whether electroacupuncture could alleviate the visceral and secondary somatic hyperalgesia in  rats by suppressing the TH-IR expression in related dorsal root ganglia. After trinitrobenzene sulfonic  irritation, rats developed inflammatory tissue damage in the distal colon, which was accompanied by visceral hypersensitivity and secondary hind paw hyperalgesia, as indicated by enhanced visceromotor response to colorectal distension and decreased mechanical and thermal withdrawal latency of the hind paw. Additionally, excessive TH-IR fibers sprouted toward calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive sensory neurons, and TH-IR neurons also increased in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia of  rats. Both electroacupuncture and guanethidine attenuated visceral and referred hind paw hyperalgesia by inhibiting the over-expression of TH-IR neurons and fibers in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia. Moreover local inflammatory damage in the distal colon was restored after 7 days of electroacupuncture intervention. These results suggest that electroacupuncture relieved visceral and referred hind paw hypersensitivity in  rats by inhibiting TH expression in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, LPPp was evaluated to protect animals against inflammatory ulcerative  (UC). UC was induced by intracolonic instillation of a 6% acetic  solution and the animals received LPPp (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal route 1 h before and 17 h after acetic  injection. Eighteen hours after instillation of acetic , the mice were euthanized and the colons were excised to determine the wet weight, macroscopic and microscopic lesion scores, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, IL1-β levels, glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The results revealed that LPPp treatment (40 mg/kg) had a protective effect on acetic -induced  by reducing the wet weight, macroscopic and microscopic scores of intestinal lesions and colonic MPO activity. Additionally, LPPp inhibited tissue oxidative stress, since decreases in GSH consumption, MDA concentration and SOD activity were observed. The treatment with LPPp reduced the levels of cytokine IL-1β, contributing to the reduction of colon inflammation. Biochemical investigation showed that LPPp comprises a mixture of proteins containing proteinases, chitinases and proteinase inhibitors. These data suggest that LPPp has a protective effect against intestinal damage through mechanisms that involve the inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration, cytokine release and oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, we aimed to identify gene expression changes in inflamed mucosa from Crohn's disease and ulcerative  patients treated with 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) (N = 25) or anti-TNF agents (N = 12) compared to drug-free IBD patients (N = 12) and non-IBD control subjects (N = 18). The mucosal expression of 84 genes previously associated with IBD was evaluated by qPCR. We found that both therapeutic regimens induce a decrease in LCN2, NOS2, and TFF1, the levels of which are overexpressed in drug-free patients compared to non-IBD control subjects. Interestingly, a stronger effect of anti-TNF drugs was observed on LCN2 and TFF1 levels. However, 5-ASA seems to induce a more robust reduction of NOS2 expression. Moreover, we found that anti-TNF treatment significantly increased ABCB1, leading to levels similar to those found in non-IBD control subjects.© 2019 The Authors.

We aimed to assess patients with UC-PSC or UC alone and describe differences in clinical and phenotypic characteristics, antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, and long-term clinical outcomes.This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients who received a diagnosis of UC from 1962 through 2015. We evaluated clinical factors associated with UC-PSC vs UC alone and assessed associations by using multivariable logistic regression models.Among 522 patients with UC, 56 (10.7%) had PSC. Compared with UC alone, patients with UC-PSC were younger (younger than 20 years) at diagnosis (odds ratios [OR], 2.35; adjusted P = 0.02) and had milder UC severity (adjusted P = 0.05), despite having pancolonic involvement (OR, 7.01; adjusted P < 0.001). In the biologics era (calendar year 2005 to 2015), patients with UC-PSC less commonly received anti-TNF therapy compared with patients with UC (OR, 0.38; adjusted P = 0.009), but their response rates were similar. Fewer patients with UC-PSC received corticosteroids (OR, 0.24; adjusted P = 0.005) or rectal 5-aminosalicyte  (OR, 0.26; adjusted P < 0.001). Other differences were identified that were not statistically significant in a multivariable model: patients with UC-PSC more commonly were male, had lower rates of smoking, and had higher rates of colorectal cancer and colectomy.This study identified a unique phenotype of UC with concurrent PSC, which had different clinical behavior compared with UC only. These phenotypic characteristics can help identify high-risk patients with UC before PSC is diagnosed and guide different management and monitoring strategies.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Disruption of the colon barrier is one of the first events leading to invasion of bacteria and activation of the immune system. The colon barrier is strongly influenced by sphingolipids. Sphingolipids impact cell-cell contacts and function as second messengers. We collected blood and colon tissue samples from UC patients and healthy controls and investigated the sphingolipids and other lipids by LC-MS/MS or LC-QTOFMS. The expression of enzymes of the sphingolipid pathway were determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. In inflamed colon tissue, the de novo-synthesis of sphingolipids is reduced, whereas lactosylceramides are increased. Reduction of dihydroceramides was due to posttranslational inhibition rather than altered serine palmitoyl transferase or ceramide synthase expression in inflamed colon tissue. Furthermore, in human plasma from UC-patients, several sphinglipids change significantly in comparison to healthy controls. Beside sphingolipids free fatty , lysophosphatidylcholines and triglycerides changed significantly in the blood of  patients dependent on the disease severity. Our data indicate that detraction of the sphingolipid de novo synthesis in colon tissue might be an important trigger for UC. Several lipids changed significantly in the blood, which might be used as biomarkers for disease control; however, diet-related variabilities need to be considered.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473343>Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides alleviate colon tumorigenesis via restoring intestinal barrier function and enhancing anti-tumor immune response.</a></h1><p>Intact epithelial barrier and mucosal immune system are crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis.

However, it remains largely unknown whether DOPS can suppress AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer (CRC) model through its direct impact on intestinal barrier function and intestinal mucosal immunity.

Treatment with 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) and DOPS significantly improved the clinical signs and symptoms of chronic , relieve colon damage, suppress the formation and growth of colon tumor in CRC mice. Moreover, administration of DOPS effectively preserved the intestinal barrier function via reducing the loss of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in adjacent tissues and carcinomatous tissues. Further studies demonstrated that DOPS improved the metabolic ability of tumor infiltrated CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and reduced the expression of PD-1 on CTLs to enhance the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironments (TME). Together, the conclusions indicated that DOPS restore intestinal barrier function and enhance intestinal anti-tumor immune response to suppress CRC, which may be a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of CRC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to compare the frequency and severity of complications in patients with the rectal remnant left subcutaneously versus patients with the rectal remnant left intra-abdominally. A secondary aim was to identify risk factors for complications.Consecutive patients at two tertiary centers in Sweden were retrospectively reviewed regarding surgical procedures; complications classified according to Clavien-Dindo; and possible risk factors for complications such as preoperative medication, emergency surgery, and body mass index.307 patients were identified. Minor complications were more common than previously reported (85%-89%). Severe surgical complications were not related to the handling of the rectal remnant. Leaving the rectal remnant subcutaneously was associated with local wound problems. Risk factors for severe complications were emergency surgery and preoperative medication with 5-aminosalicylic .Minor complications after colectomy for ulcerative  are very common and need to be addressed. Leaving the rectal stump intra-abdominally seems safe and may be advantageous to reduce local wound morbidity.</p></html>
