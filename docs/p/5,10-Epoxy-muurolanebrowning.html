We found that activin E functions as a hepatokine that enhances thermogenesis in response to cold exposure through beige adipocyte emergence in inguinal WAT (ingWAT). Hepatic activin E overexpression activated thermogenesis through Ucp1 upregulation in ingWAT and other adipose tissues including interscapular brown adipose tissue and mesenteric WAT. Hepatic activin E-transgenic mice exhibited improved insulin sensitivity. Inhibin βE gene silencing inhibited cold-induced Ucp1 induction in ingWAT. Furthermore, in vitro experiments suggested that activin E directly stimulated expression of Ucp1 and Fgf21, which was mediated by transforming growth factor-β or activin type I receptors. We uncovered a function of activin E to stimulate energy expenditure through brown and beige adipocyte activation, suggesting a possible preventive or therapeutic target for obesity.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to determine if an increased polyphenolic content of apples is inversely related to clinical allergic reactions in sufferers.The polyphenolic content of two old and two new apple cultivars was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography. The in vitro concentration of sulfidoleukotrienes and the CD63 basophil activation of 27 birch pollen sufferers with cross-reactivity to apples were determined with cellular antigen stimulation and basophil activation tests after incubation with different apple cultivars.The flesh of old cultivars was characterized by significantly higher total polyphenolic content (86.1 ± . µg/g) than that of new cultivars (24.7 ± 7.2 µg/g). The concentration of sulfidoleukotrienes and the CD63 basophil activation of old apple cultivars was up to 62% lower than new ones and decreased as the degree of enzymatic  increased.Old apples cultivars are better tolerated than new ones by birch pollen-allergic individuals.

When 850 patients had reached 12-month follow-up, we analyzed data regarding the primary end point, a composite of death or disabling stroke at 24 months, using Bayesian methods.Of the 1468 patients who underwent randomization, an attempted TAVR or surgical procedure was performed in 1403. The patients' mean age was 74 years. The 24-month estimated incidence of the primary end point was .3% in the TAVR group and 6.7% in the surgery group (difference, -1.4 percentage points; 95% Bayesian credible interval for difference, -4.9 to 2.1; posterior probability of noninferiority >0.999). At 30 days, patients who had undergone TAVR, as compared with surgery, had a lower incidence of disabling stroke (0.% vs. 1.7%), bleeding complications (2.4% vs. 7.%), acute kidney injury (0.9% vs. 2.8%), and atrial fibrillation (7.7% vs. 35.4%) and a higher incidence of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (3.% vs. 0.%) and pacemaker implantation (17.4% vs. 6.1%). At 12 months, patients in the TAVR group had lower aortic-valve gradients than those in the surgery group (8.6 mm Hg vs. 11.2 mm Hg) and larger effective orifice areas (2.3 cm vs. 2.0 cm).In patients with severe aortic stenosis who were at low surgical risk, TAVR with a self-expanding supraannular bioprosthesis was noninferior to surgery with respect to the composite end point of death or disabling stroke at 24 months.

Irisin/ fibronectin type III domain-containing  (FNDC5) protects against obesity by inducing  in white adipose tissue. Objectives This study investigated the effects of icariin on irisin/FNDC5 expression in C2C12 myotubes. Method Cultured murine C2C12 myocytes were used to study the effects of icariin on irisin/FNDC5 expressions by Western-blot, qPCR, Elisa and Immunofluorescence. We also investigated FNDC5 expression in icariin-treated intact mice. Results Icariin increased irisin/FNDC5 protein levels. mRNA levels of irisin/FNDC5 were also increased in C2C12 myocytes after treatment with icariin. Icariin increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1alpha (PGC-1α) protein and mRNA levels. Additionally, icariin exposure resulted in phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in a dose-dependent manner. The regulatory effect of icariin on FNDC5 protein expression was blocked by the AMPK antagonist compound C or silencing of AMPK, suggesting that icariin increased FNDC5 protein expression via the AMPK pathway. In vivo, icariin decreased body weight gain in C57BL/6 mice and increased FNDC5, PGC-1α, and p-AMPK expression levels in skeletal muscle. Conclusions Taken together, our results indicated that icariin induces irisin/FNDC5 expression via the AMPK pathway, indicating that icariin may be promising as an anti-obesity drug.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

A tyrosinase inhibitor was purified from Camellia pollen using high-speed countercurrent chromatography and preparative HPLC and was identiﬁed as caffeine by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. It showed strong mushroom tyrosinase inhibitory activity with an IC of 18. ± 2.31μg/mL in a noncompetitive model. The caffeine did not interact with copper ions in the active center of the enzyme but could quench ﬂuorescence intensity and change the secondary conformation of this tyrosinase. A molecular dynamics simulation showed that caffeine bound this tyrosinase via Lys379, Lys 376, Asp357, Glu356, Thr308, Gln307, Asp312 and Trp358, thus changing the binding sites of L-tyrosine and the loop conformation adjacent to the active center. In vitro cell model analysis revealed that caffeine exhibited significant inhibitory effects on both intracellular tyrosinase activity and melanin production of B16-F10 melanoma cells in a concentration-dependent manner. These comprehensive results suggest that caffeine is a strong tyrosinase inhibitor that has the potentials to be developed as skin-whitening agents in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries or as anti- agents in food industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977919>Effect of Dipping and Vacuum Impregnation Pretreatments on the Quality of Frozen Apples: A Comparative Study on Organic and Conventional Fruits.</a></h1><p>The effect of dipping and vacuum impregnation (VI) pretreatments with lemon juice solution on the quality and stability of organic and conventional frozen apples was investigated. Fresh apples were characterized; organic apples showed, at equal starch and ripeness index, a lower sugar content, and higher acidity than conventional ones. The polyphenol content was slightly higher in organic apples than in conventional ones while polyphenoloxidase activity was similar. No differences in color and firmness were evidenced. Dipping affected organic and conventional apples' color by determining an increase of lightness (ΔL ≈ 4) and h° (Δh° ≈ 6) parameters. VI reduced the lightness of apples (ΔL ≈ -3) but the addition of lemon juice counterbalanced the lightness reduction by increasing ΔL from 3 to 1. ca. Pretreatments did not affect the firmness of organic fruits while impaired that of the conventional ones ( 26% on average), likely due to different fruit matrix porosity and cell wall composition. Freezing (-40 °C) and frozen storage (up to 300 days) dramatically reduced the firmness of organic (42%) and conventional products (58%). At equal pretreatment and storage time (that is, 15, 30, 300 days), higher firmness retention was evidenced in organic apples than in conventional ones. All through frozen storage, VI was shown to better preserve the mechanical properties of organic apples than that of conventional ones. Both freezing and frozen storage reduced the hue of frozen apple products by up to 8% due to  reactions. Lemon juice addition increased the hue of both frozen samples and thawed samples by about 2% all through storage time.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362192>Occurrence of acrylamide and other heat-induced compounds in panela: Relationship with physicochemical and antioxidant parameters.</a></h1><p>Panela is a natural, unrefined non-centrifugal sugar obtained by intense dehydration of sugarcane juice. Acrylamide, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and furfural were determined in 40 panela samples distributed as granulated and block according to the technological process. Colour, , moisture, water activity, pH and antioxidant capacity were also evaluated. Acrylamide ranged between 60 and 3058 µg/kg; granulated panela reporting the highest concentration (812 µg/kg) compared with block panela (540 µg/kg). The lower content in HMF and furfural, the intense dehydration, and the extensive darkening of granulated panela suggested the  reactions were boosted due to the application of more severe thermal treatments. Principal component analysis showed a significant relationship between the panela presentation and the concentration of the analysed compounds. Benchmark values considering both types of processes would help to establish mitigation initiatives in panela products.

In approximately 1% of melanomas, BRAF or CRAF are activated through structural arrangements. We describe here a metastatic melanoma with a GOLGA4-RAF1 fusion and pathogenic variants in CTNNB1 and CDKN2A. Anti-CTLA4/anti-PD1 combination immunotherapy failed to control tumor progression. In the absence of other actionable variants the patient was administered MEK inhibitor therapy on the basis of its potential action against RAF1 fusions. This resulted in a profound and clinically significant response. We demonstrated that GOLGA4-RAF1 expression was associated with ERK activation, elevated expression of the RAS/RAF downstream co-effector ETV5, and a high Ki67 index. These findings provide a rationale for the dramatic response to targeted therapy.

Here we present a graph reference genome implementation that enables read alignment across 2,800 diploid genomes encompassing 12.6 million SNPs and 4.0 million insertions and deletions (indels). The pipeline processes one whole-genome sequencing sample in 6. h using a system with 36 CPU cores. We show that using a graph genome reference improves read mapping sensitivity and produces a 0.% increase in variant calling recall, with unaffected specificity. Structural variations incorporated into a graph genome can be genotyped accurately under a unified framework. Finally, we show that iterative augmentation of graph genomes yields incremental gains in variant calling accuracy.

Impairment in the browning process of subcutaneous tissues proposed to contribute to obesity pathogenesis. In the current study, we aimed to assess whether the expression of brown  genes in subcutaneous tissues in obese patients is altered as compared to non-obese patients.Participants were recruited from patients undergoing general surgeries. At the same site of surgery, biopsies were taken from the abdominal subcutaneous tissues from each participant, along with a venous blood sample. The expression of BAT genes was measured using a real-time PCR method. Serum FGF21 was measured using an ELISA kit, and the serum blood  profile was measured using the Dimension VistaTM 1500 System.A total of 58 surgical patients was involved. A low expression of BAT genes was observed in the groups with higher body mass index (BMI) (< 30 kg/m) as compared to the groups with lower BMI (> 30 kg/m). The expression of CIDEA and CITED1 was significantly higher in the patients with normal weight as compared to obese ( = 0.01 and  = 0.02, respectively). A significant negative correlation was found between the expression of BAT genes and BMI in patients with BMI < 35 kg/m. However, the strongest negative correlation was observed in the expression of CIDEA ( = -0.,  = 0.004), followed by TBX1 ( = -0.4,  = 0.01), CITED1, and ZIC1 ( = -0.4,  = 0.03). Whereas the correlation of UCP1 with BMI remained insignificant ( = -0.29,  = 0.08). When including patients with BMI > 35 kg/m, the correlation decreased and became insignificant ( = 0.08). No significant correlation was found between the expression of BAT genes and blood  profiles ( > 0.05). Serum FGF21 was positively and significantly correlated to the expression of UCP1 ( = 0.56,  = 0.02) and TBX1 ( = 0.62,  = 0.01), however, this correlation was missing in patients with severe obesity.Our data suggested that brown and beige genes expression in abdominal subcutaneous tissues is dysregulated in patients with obesity.

Five major anthocyanins namely malvidin-3--glucoside (M3G), delphinidin-3--glucoside (D3G), petunidin-3--glucoside (Pt3G), peonidin-3--glucoside (Pn3G), and cyanidin-3--glucoside (C3G) were identified. Juice from "Merlot" had significantly higher ( < 0.05) content of all individual anthocyanins as compared to "Ruby." During the long-term storage, total, and individual anthocyanins from both cultivars degraded following first-order reaction kinetics at the rate strongly dependent on temperature. At the end of the storage, noticeably higher loss of anthocyanins (95-99.9%) was observed at 25 and 35°C as compared to storage at °C [50-60% ("Merlot"); 74-81% ("Ruby")]. Considerably lower rate of decay was observed at °C ( = 0.01-0.04) as compared to 25 ( = 0.04-0.14) and 35°C ( = 0.05-0.14) storage temperatures. The most temperature sensitive anthocyanin compounds were C3G (E = 66. kJ/mol) and D3G (E = 63.3 kJ/mol). At higher storage temperatures, significant ( < 0.05) and strong negative correlations were observed between anthocyanin concentrations and the levels of haze, polymeric and brown color development during storage. Storing grape juice, at lower temperature conditions could reduce the continuous loss of biologically active anthocyanins as well as the development of haze and brown color.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30938559>Effects of Adaptive Hearing Aid Directionality and Noise Reduction on Masked Speech Recognition for Children Who Are Hard of Hearing.</a></h1><p>Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate speech-in-noise and speech-in-speech recognition associated with activation of a fully adaptive directional hearing aid algorithm in children with mild to severe bilateral sensory/neural hearing loss. Method Fourteen children (-14 years old) who are hard of hearing participated in this study. Participants wore laboratory hearing aids. Open-set word recognition thresholds were measured adaptively for 2 hearing aid settings: (a) omnidirectional (OMNI) and (b) fully adaptive directionality. Each hearing aid setting was evaluated in 3 listening conditions. Fourteen children with normal hearing served as age-matched controls. Results Children who are hard of hearing required a more advantageous signal-to-noise ratio than children with normal hearing to achieve comparable performance in all 3 conditions. For children who are hard of hearing, the average improvement in signal-to-noise ratio when comparing fully adaptive directionality to OMNI was 4.0 dB in noise, regardless of target location. Children performed similarly with fully adaptive directionality and OMNI settings in the presence of the speech maskers. Conclusions Compared to OMNI, fully adaptive directionality improved speech recognition in steady noise for children who are hard of hearing, even when they were not facing the target source. This algorithm did not affect speech recognition when the background noise was speech. Although the use of hearing aids with fully adaptive directionality is not proposed as a substitute for remote microphone systems, it appears to offer several advantages over fixed directionality, because it does not depend on children facing the target talker and provides access to multiple talkers within the environment. Additional experiments are required to further evaluate children's performance under a variety of spatial configurations in the presence of both noise and speech maskers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049967>Shelf-life study of ready-to-cook slices of globe artichoke 'Spinoso sardo': effects of anti- solutions and edible coating enriched with Foeniculum vulgare essential oil.</a></h1><p>The globe artichoke [Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus (L.)

In this study, the effects of (i) anti- treatments (citric acid 0.% + ascorbic acid 2%, or cysteine 0.%, w/v) and (ii) dipping in locust bean gum (LBG) edible coating with or without Foeniculum vulgare essential oil (EO) were evaluated on RTC globe artichoke slices cv. 'Spinoso sardo' during storage (11 days at 4 °C). Fresh weight loss, color, texture, polyphenol oxidase (PPO), microbiological and chemical parameters, antioxidant capacity, and sensory descriptors were determined.The results showed that, despite the antioxidant treatment used, when EO was added to LBG, all microbiological groups underwent an average reduction of 0.50 log CFU g . Cysteine preserved the antioxidant capacity, color, and texture of samples better than citric acid and ascorbic acid, and inhibited PPO; the addition of EO to LBG enhanced these effects. At the end of the storage period, the overall highest sensory attribute score was attained by the coated globe artichoke samples with EO.The marked efficacy of the LBG edible coating with added F. vulgare EO in maintaining microbiological, physical, chemical, and sensory qualities makes it a promising processing tool for the preservation of ready-to-cook Spinoso sardo globe artichoke slices during storage for 11 days at 4 °C. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640715>Upregulation of FNDC5 gene expression in C2C12 cells after single and combined treatments of resveratrol and ATRA.</a></h1><p>Irisin is a newly discovered myokine that secreted from skeletal muscle cells. Several studies showed that irisin involves in thermogenesis and increases the expression of  markers such as uncoupling protein-1 that in turns induces the conversion of white adipose tissue to brown fat. Resveratrol (Res) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can also upregulate the expression of thermogenesis genes. In the present study, the effects of single and combined treatments of Res and ATRA on fibronectin type III domain containing  (FNDC5) gene expression was explored.The mouse myoblasts, C2C12 cells, were seeded in 6-well plastic plates and cultured in DMEM media. After differentiation, in a pilot study, C2C12 myotubes were treated with different concentrations of Res and ATRA for 12 h. The best result was obtained by treatment of 1and 25 μM of Res and 1 μM of ATRA. Then the main study was continued by single and combined treatment of these compounds at chosen concentration. After treatments, total RNA was extracted from C2C12 cells.

The Sec pathway is the standard means of transporting the target protein but it is unable to transport complex or rapidly folding proteins because the Sec system can only transport proteins in an unfolded state. The Tat system also operates to transport proteins to the periplasm, and it has significant potential as an alternative means of recombinant protein production because it transports fully folded proteins. Here, we have tested the Tat system's full potential for the production of biotherapeutics for the first time using fed-batch fermentation. We expressed human growth hormone (hGH) with a Tat signal peptide in E. coli W3110 "TatExpress" strains that contain elevated levels of the Tat apparatus. This construct contained four amino acids from TorA at the hGH N-terminus as well as the initiation methionine from hGH, which is removed in vivo. We show that the protein is efficiently exported to the periplasm during extended fed-batch fermentation, to the extent that it is by far the most abundant protein in the periplasm. The protein was shown to be homogeneous, disulfide bonded, and active. The bioassay showed that the yields of purified periplasmic hGH are .4 g/L culture whereas an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay gave a figure of 2.39 g/L. Separate analysis of a TorA signal peptide linked to hGH construct lacking any additional amino acids likewise showed efficient export to the periplasm, although yields were approximately two-fold lower.© 2019 The Authors.

The parameters were determined after left the fruits at 25°C for 2 days. It was found that, in the tissue adjacent to the core, .0 mM SA for 2 hr and 0.01 mM MeJA for 3 hr alleviated chilling injury (CI) and maintained color than other treatments. The MeJA immersions lowered CI score, electrolyte leakage, and malondialdehyde content greater than other treatments. SA and MeJA immersions retarded polyphenol oxidase activity, total phenols, and induced antioxidant activity during storage. In the pulp tissue, SA treatment increased ascorbic acid and total sugar contents, and MeJA immersions enhanced bioactive compound and antioxidant enzyme activities than SA immersion. Therefore, MeJA immersions could alleviate CI and enhance antioxidant better than other treatments of pineapples during cold storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Postharvest immersion at the optimum concentration of SA or MeJA can be applied for commercial scale in order to alleviate chilling of "Sawi" pineapple fruit during storage.

Despite this, a detailed understanding of the structure of the SAM-water interface generated from both formation and use of the SAM in an aqueous environment is elusive, and analytical measurements of the structure and chemistry of the SAM-water interface are an ongoing experimental challenge. To address this, we used neutron reflectometry (NR) to measure water association with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic SAMs under both wet and dry conditions. SAMs used for this study were made from hydrophobic decanethiol mixed with hydrophilic 11-azido-1-undecanethiol with compositions of 0-100% of the azide-terminated thiol. All SAMs were formed by conventional solution incubation of a Au substrate immersed in ethanol. Each SAM was characterized by grazing incidence angle reflection-absorption Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy, contact angle goniometry, and electrochemical methods to confirm it was a completely formed monolayer with evidence of extensive crystalline-like domains. NR measured significant absorption of water into each SAM, ranging from 1.6 to .7 water molecules per alkyl thiol, when SAMs were immersed in water. Water infiltration was independent of SAM composition and terminal group hydrophilicity.

Indeed, brown and beige adipose tissues have been demonstrated to play a role in glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism-all factors related to pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Many agents capable of initiating  have been identified so far and tested widely in humans and animal models including in vitro and in vivo experiments. Interestingly, several agents demonstrated to have  activity are in fact secreted as adipokines from brown and beige fat tissue, suggesting a physiological relevance both in beige adipocyte recruitment processes and in maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. The newest findings on agents driving beige fat recruitment, their mechanisms, and implications on type 2 diabetes are discussed in this review.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671737> Effects of a Chronic Pterostilbene Supplementation in Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.</a></h1><p>Obesity and related comorbidities are a major health concern. The drugs used to treat these conditions are largely inadequate or dangerous, and a well-researched approach based on nutraceuticals would be highly useful. Pterostilbene (Pt), i.e., 3,-dimethylresveratrol, has been reported to be effective in animal models of obesity, acting on different metabolic pathways. We investigate here its ability to induce  of white adipose tissue. Pt ( µM) was first tested on 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, and then it was administered (352 µmol/kg/day) to mice fed an obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) for 30 weeks, starting at weaning. In the cultured adipocytes, the treatment elicited a significant increase of the levels of Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) protein-a key component of thermogenic, energy-dissipating beige/brown adipocytes. In vivo administration antagonized weight increase, more so in males than in females. Analysis of inguinal White Adipose Tissue (WAT) revealed a trend towards , with significantly increased transcription of several marker genes (, , , , , and ) and an increase in UCP1 protein levels, which, however, did not achieve significance. Given the lack of known side effects of Pt, this study strengthens the candidacy of this natural phenol as an anti-obesity nutraceutical.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30347011>Effect of Prefrontal Cortex Stimulation on Regulation of Amygdala Response to Threat in Individuals With Trait Anxiety: A Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h1><p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is under clinical investigation as a treatment for major depressive disorder. However, the mechanisms of action are unclear, and there is a lack of neuroimaging evidence, particularly among individuals with affective dysfunction. Furthermore, there is no direct causal evidence among humans that the prefrontal-amygdala circuit functions as described in animal models (ie, that increasing activity in prefrontal cortical control regions inhibits amygdala response to threat).To determine whether stimulation of the prefrontal cortex reduces amygdala threat reactivity in individuals with trait anxiety.This community-based randomized clinical trial used a double-blind, within-participants design (2 imaging sessions per participant). Eighteen women with high trait anxiety (age range, 18-42 years) who scored greater than 45 on the trait measure of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were randomized to receive active or sham tDCS of the DLPFC during the first session and the other intervention during the next session. Each intervention was followed immediately by a functional imaging scan during which participants performed an attentional task requiring them to ignore threatening face distractors. Data were collected from May 7 to October 6, 2015.Amygdala threat response, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging.Data from 16 female participants (mean age, 23 years; range, 18-42 years), with 8 in each group, were analyzed. Compared with sham stimulation, active DLPFC stimulation significantly reduced bilateral amygdala threat reactivity (z = 3.30, P = .04) and simultaneously increased activity in cortical regions associated with attentional control (z = 3.28, P < .001). In confirmatory behavioral analyses, there was a mean improvement in task accuracy of 12.2% (95% CI, 0.30%-24.0%; mean [SD] difference in number of correct answers, 2.2 [4.]; t15 = 1.94, P = .04) after active DLPFC stimulation.These results reveal a causal role for prefrontal regulation of amygdala function in attentional capture by threat in individuals with high trait anxiety. The finding that prefrontal stimulation acutely increases attentional control signals and reduces amygdala threat reactivity may indicate a neurocognitive mechanism that could contribute to tDCS treatment effects in affective disorders.isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN78638425.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31167938>A Prediction Model to Identify Febrile Infants ≤60 Days at Low Risk of Invasive Bacterial Infection.</a></h1><p>To derive and internally validate a prediction model for the identification of febrile infants ≤60 days old at low probability of invasive bacterial infection (IBI).We conducted a case-control study of febrile infants ≤60 days old who presented to the emergency departments of 11 hospitals between July 1, 2011 and June 30, 2016. Infants with IBI, defined by growth of a pathogen in blood (bacteremia) and/or cerebrospinal fluid (bacterial meningitis), were matched by hospital and date of visit to 2 control patients without IBI. Ill-appearing infants and those with complex chronic conditions were excluded. Predictors of IBI were identified with multiple logistic regression and internally validated with 10-fold cross-validation, and an IBI score was calculated.We included 181 infants with IBI (155 [85.6%] with bacteremia without meningitis and 26 [14.4%] with bacterial meningitis) and 362 control patients. Twenty-three infants with IBI (12.7%) and 138 control patients (38.1%) had fever by history only. Four predictors of IBI were identified (area under the curve 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79-0.86]) and incorporated into an IBI score: age <21 days (1 point), highest temperature recorded in the emergency department 38.0-38.4°C (2 points) or ≥38.°C (4 points), absolute neutrophil count ≥5185 cells per μL (2 points), and abnormal urinalysis results (3 points). The sensitivity and specificity of a score ≥2 were 98.8% (95% CI: 95.7%-99.9%) and 31.3% (95% CI: 26.3%-36.6%), respectively. All 26 infants with meningitis had scores ≥2.Infants ≤60 days old with fever by history only, a normal urinalysis result, and an absolute neutrophil count <5185 cells per μL have a low probability of IBI.Copyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145227>Prophylactic Autologous Slings at the Time of Obstetric Fistula Repair: A Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h1><p>To compare prophylactic slings for women with obstetric fistulas at high risk of residual incontinence.This was a multiple-site randomized controlled trial comparing autologous fascia slings to pubococcygeal (PC) slings at time of fistula repair. Women with a Goh type 3 or 4 vesicovaginal fistula (distal edge of the fistula is ≤2. cm from the external urethral orifice) with no prior repair were randomized to receive either a rectus fascia sling or a PC sling while undergoing fistula repair. Interviews were performed before surgery and at follow-up 1 to 6 months later including the Michigan Incontinence Symptom Index and the Incontinence Quality of Life Tool. Pad weights were also collected at this time. Safety analysis was performed after 10 participants were enrolled in each arm.Eleven participants randomized to a PC sling and 10 to a rectus sling. There was 1 repair breakdown in the PC group and 3 in the rectus group. There was no significant difference noted in pad weights or quality of life scores between groups. Quality of life and Michigan Incontinence Symptom Index scores improved significantly for both groups after surgery. The study was terminated at safety analysis due to the number of breakdowns and difficulty of follow-up at 1 site.There was no superiority between slings. Randomization proved problematic given the vast heterogeneity between fistula injuries.

This long read capacity was exploited to detect antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in a large veterinary teaching hospital environment, and to assess their taxonomic origin, genetic organisation and association with mobilisation markers concurrently. Samples were collected on eight occasions between November 2016 and May 2017 (inclusive) in a longitudinal study. Nanopore sequencing was performed on total DNA extracted from the samples after a minimal enrichment step in broth. Many ARGs present in the veterinary hospital environment could potentially confer resistance to antimicrobials widely used in treating infections of companion animals, including aminoglycosides, extended-spectrum beta-lactams, sulphonamides, macrolides, and tetracyclines. High-risk ARGs, defined here as single or multiple ARGs associated with pathogenic bacterial species or with mobile genetic elements, were shared between the intensive care unit (ICU) patient cages, a dedicated laundry trolley and a floor cleaning mop-bucket. By contrast, a floor surface from an office corridor without animal contact and located outside the veterinary hospital did not contain such high-risk ARGs. Relative abundances of high-risk ARGs and co-localisation of these genes on the same sequence read were higher in the laundry trolley and mop bucket samples, compared to the ICU cages, suggesting that amplification of ARGs is likely to occur in the collection points for hospital waste. These findings have prompted the implementation of targeted intervention measures in the veterinary hospital to mitigate the risks of transferring clinically important ARGs between sites and to improve biosecurity practices in the facility.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567366>Resveratrol-Induced White Adipose Tissue  in Obese Mice by Remodeling Fecal Microbiota.</a></h1><p>Promoting the  of white fat may be a potential means of combating obesity. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effect of resveratrol (RES) on the body weight and  of white fat in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice and the potential associated mechanism in vivo. Eight-week-old male mice were randomized to receive different treatments: (1), chow without any additional treatment (chow); (2), chow plus 0.4% resveratrol (chow-RES); (3), HFD without any additional treatment (HFD); and (4), HFD plus 0.4% resveratrol (HFD-RES). After 4 weeks of feeding, additional 8-week-old male recipient mice were randomly allocated to the following 4 treatments: (), HFD and received feces from chow-fed mice; (6), HFD and received feces from chow-RES-fed mice; (7), HFD and received feces from HFD-fed mice; and (8), HFD and received feces from HFD-RES-fed mice. RES treatment significantly inhibited increases in fat accumulation, promoted the  of white adipose tissue (WAT) and alleviated gut microbiota dysbiosis in HFD-fed mice. Subsequent analyses showed that the gut microbiota remodeling induced by resveratrol had a positive role in WAT , and sirtuin-1 (Sirt1) signaling appears to be a key component of this process. Overall, the results show that RES may serve as a potential intervention to reduce obesity by alleviating dysbiosis of the gut microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31037289>Effect of Initial Management With Aflibercept vs Laser Photocoagulation vs Observation on Vision Loss Among Patients With Diabetic Macular Edema Involving the Center of the Macula and Good Visual Acuity: A Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h1><p>Intravitreous injections of antivascular endothelial growth factor agents are effective for treating diabetic macular edema (DME) involving the center of the macula (center-involved DME [CI-DME]) with visual acuity impairment (20/32 or worse). The best approach to treating patients with CI-DME and good visual acuity (20/25 or better) is unknown.To compare vision loss at 2 years among eyes initially managed with aflibercept, laser photocoagulation, or observation.Randomized clinical trial conducted at 91 US and Canadian sites among 702 adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Participants had 1 study eye with CI-DME and visual acuity of 20/25 or better. The first participant was randomized on November 8, 2013, and the final date of follow-up was September 11, 2018.Eyes were randomly assigned to 2.0 mg of intravitreous aflibercept (n = 226) as frequently as every 4 weeks, focal/grid laser photocoagulation (n = 240), or observation (n = 236). Aflibercept was required for eyes in the laser photocoagulation or observation groups that had decreased visual acuity from baseline by at least 10 letters (≥ 2 lines on an eye chart) at any visit or by  to 9 letters (1-2 lines) at 2 consecutive visits.The primary outcome was at least a -letter visual acuity decrease from baseline at 2 years. Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration adverse events (defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular or unknown death) were reported.Among 702 randomized participants (mean age, 59 years; 38% female [n=264]), 625 of 681 (92% excluding deaths) completed the 2-year visit. For eyes with visual acuity that decreased from baseline, aflibercept was initiated in 25% (60/240) and 34% (80/236) in the laser photocoagulation and observation groups, respectively. At 2 years, the percentage of eyes with at least a -letter visual acuity decrease was 16% (33/205), 17% (36/212), and 19% (39/208) in the aflibercept, laser photocoagulation, and observation groups, respectively (aflibercept vs laser photocoagulation risk difference, -2% [95% CI, -9% to %]; relative risk, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.57-1.35; P = .79]; aflibercept vs observation risk difference, -3% [95% CI, -11% to 4%]; relative risk, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.55-1.27; P = .79]; laser photocoagulation vs observation risk difference, -1% [95% CI, -9% to 6%]; relative risk, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.64-1.41; P = .79]). Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration vascular events occurred in 15 (7%), 13 (%), and 8 (3%) participants in the aflibercept, laser photocoagulation, and observation groups.Among eyes with CI-DME and good visual acuity, there was no significant difference in vision loss at 2 years whether eyes were initially managed with aflibercept or with laser photocoagulation or observation and given aflibercept only if visual acuity worsened.

SQA at 2. - 10 µM induced the differentiation of white adipocytes to beige adipocytes partially by increasing the mitochondrial density and the expression of beige/brown adipocyte markers. In addition, SQA activated lipid catabolic pathways, evidenced by the increased expression levels of perilipin, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1.

The glucose + asparagine model is a typical chemical system used to investigate acrylamide formation. -Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is an important carbonyl intermediate in Maillard reactions and can also react with asparagine to form acrylamide. Time courses showed that EC inhibited more HMF than acrylamide in the glucose + asparagine model heated at 180 °C. The reduction of EC on acrylamide formation in the HMF + asparagine model was about 70%, while that in the glucose + asparagine model was about 50%. Moreover, HMF decreased significantly faster when it was heated in the presence of EC. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed the formation of adducts between EC and HMF, and the dimeric adducts were verified in fried potato chips. These results suggested that the condensation of EC and HMF was one of the key steps leading to the inhibition of acrylamide.

Upon activation, brown adipose tissue (BAT) clears vast amounts of lipids and glucose from the circulation and thus substantially lowers plasma lipid levels. As a consequence, BAT activation protects from the development of atherosclerosis. However, it is unclear if pharmacologic activation of BAT can be exploited therapeutically to reduce plaque burden in established atherosclerotic disease. Here we study the impact of thermogenic adipose tissues on plaque regression in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. Thermogenic adipocytes in atherosclerotic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR)-deficient mice were pharmacologically activated by dietary CL316,243 (CL) treatment for 4 weeks and the outcomes on metabolically active tissues, plasma lipids and atherosclerosis were analyzed. While the chronic activation of thermogenic adipocytes reduced adiposity, increased  of white adipose tissue (WAT), altered liver gene expression, and reduced plasma triglyceride levels, atherosclerotic plaque burden remained unchanged. Our findings suggest that despite improving adiposity and plasma triglycerides, pharmacologic activation of thermogenic adipocytes is not able to reverse atherosclerosis in LDLR-deficient mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30518367>Electric stimulation of ears accelerates body weight loss mediated by high-fat to low-fat diet switch accompanied by increased white adipose tissue  in C57BL/6 J mice.</a></h1><p>Weight reduction frequently occurs in patients receiving vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy. Therefore, we hypothesized that during dietary intervention for weight loss, auricular electric stimulation (AES), an alternative of VNS, accelerates weight loss by increasing white adipose tissue (WAT)  and increases energy expenditure.C57BL/6J male mice were fed a high-fat diet for  wk. to induce obesity, then switched to a low-fat diet for  wk. and allocated into 3 groups to receive 2 Hz electric stimulation on ears, electrode clamps only, or nothing (AES, Sham and Ctrl, respectively).Switching to a low-fat diet reduced body weight progressively in all 3 groups, with the greatest reduction in the AES group. In accordance with a mild decrease in feed intake, hypothalamus mRNA levels of Npy, AgRP tended to be reduced, while Pomc tended to be increased by AES. Mice in the AES group had the highest concentrations of norepinephrine in serum and inguinal WAT, and expression levels of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) and tyrosine hydroxylase in inguinal WAT. Furthermore, their subcutaneous adipocytes had multilocular and UCP-1 characteristics, along with a smaller cell size.AES, by increasing WAT , could be used in conjunction with a low-fat diet to augment weight loss in addition to suppressing appetite.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30733760>Expression, purification and biological characterisation of recombinant human irisin (12. kDa).</a></h1><p>Fibronectin type III domain containing  (FNDC5) is a transmembrane protein.

Grinding apple with addition of water decreased  and loss of antioxidant activity when ground with water up to 1:3 ratio. , antioxidant capacity, major phenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, and procyanidin B2), and ascorbic acid in ground apple with water (1:1) were evaluated at grinding temperatures from  °C to 45 °C. The degradation of antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds, and ascorbic acid followed first-order kinetics. The temperature-dependent degradation was adequately modeled using the Arrhenius equation, and kinetic parameters such as k, t , Q , and Ea indicated that the grinding temperature was a key factor affecting retention of antioxidant activity, phenolics, and ascorbic acid contents in apple. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of fruits and vegetables can be altered by processing such as thermal treatments and grinding. Therefore, it is important to evaluate and predict the quality characteristics of the fruits as affected by processing conditions. In this study, we found grinding conditions retard the changes in color and loss in phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of ground apples.

They have attracted a lot of interest for biotechnological applications in light of their eco-friendliness: they indeed oxidize the substrate(s) by coupling the four electron reduction of the final acceptor, molecular oxygen (O), to water. Plant LMCOs represent a still poorly studied, important class of oxidoreductases controlling e.g. the post-harvest quality of fruits and enabling the tailoring of designer energy crops. We here sought to identify the LMCOs in Prunus avium L., whose fruits are rich in bioactive molecules, but are also highly perishable. The goal was to analyze them using bioinformatics (phylogenetic and in silico structural analyses) and to perform a targeted expression study on a subset of genes in six ancient varieties from Tuscany, all threatened by genetic erosion.

However, little is known about microbial transformations of different DOM components, which could provide valuable insight into biogeochemical reactivity of DOM. In this study, bioavailability experiments were conducted for 55 days to determine changes of different DOM components by microbial transformations. Labile matter (C1) was detected only in initial DOM, and tryptophan-like substances (C4) were observed from day  onwards. Thus, three individual components were identified at each sampling time of the bioavailability experiment. The increase of F in DOM components revealed that microbial humic-like substances (C2), terrestrial humic-like substances (C3), and C4 were produced by microbial transformation, especially in the spring samples. Further, two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) indicated that shorter wavelength tryptophan-like and microbial humic-like substances can be degraded by microbes or transformed into longer wavelength complex substances. Relatively simple microbial humic-like substances were preferentially produced compared to complex terrestrial humic-like substances.

Nationally representative information on changes of perioperative outcomes and utilization of surgery in the growing eligible population (class III obesity or class II obesity with comorbidities) is lacking.Adults with obesity diagnosis who underwent primary bariatric surgery in the United States from 1993 to 2016 were identified in the National Inpatient Sample database. Estimates of the yearly number, types and cost of surgeries, patients' and hospital characteristics, complications and mortality rates were obtained. Prevalence of obesity and comorbidities were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and changes in utilization of surgery were estimated.An estimated 1,903,273 patients underwent bariatric surgery in the United States between 1993 and 2016. Mean age was 43.9 years (79.9% women, 70.9% white race, 70.7% commercial insurance); these and other characteristics changed over time. Surgeries were exclusively open operations in 1993 (n = 8,631; gastric bypass and vertical banded gastroplasty, 49% each) and 98% laparoscopic (n = 162,969; 69.8% sleeve gastrectomy and 27.8% gastric bypass) in 2016. Complication and mortality rates peaked in 1998 (11.7% and 1%) and progressively decreased to 1.4% and 0.04% in 2016. Utilization increased from 0.07% in 1993 to 0.62% in 2004 and remained low at 0.% in 2016.Perioperative safety of bariatric surgery improved over the last quarter-century.

Five children died in childhood or adolescence (mean age of death: 9 years), mainly as a result of secondary respiratory complications. CACNA1B encodes the pore-forming subunit of the pre-synaptic neuronal voltage-gated calcium channel Ca2.2/N-type, crucial for SNARE-mediated neurotransmission, particularly in the early postnatal period. Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in CACNA1B are predicted to cause disruption of Ca influx, leading to impaired synaptic neurotransmission. The resultant effect on neuronal function is likely to be important in the development of involuntary movements and epilepsy. Overall, our findings provide further evidence for the key role of Ca2.2 in normal human neurodevelopment.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

Some adenoviruses can become latent in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (e.g. adenoids and tonsils), with the potential to reactivate sporadically, leading to upper or lower respiratory tract infection and disease. Bronchiolitis Obliterans (BO) is a rare chronic lung disorder which usually follows a severe insult to the respiratory tract. In children, it is a complication of severe infections (as post-infectious BO), typically manifesting after a severe respiratory infection, in previously healthy pre-school children. Symptoms and signs of air trapping (hyperinflated chest, expiratory wheeze) with persistent oxygen requirement are characteristic. The presence of the unusual mosaic tetrasomy 9p genotype in this case, despite standard cidofovir therapy for persistent or chronic adenovirus infection, may have impacted on the child's long-term clinical outcomes.We present a case of persistent AdV B3 infection in a 14-month old boy with mosaic tetrasomy 9p, which persisted for 10 weeks, resulting in radiologically-confirmed BO, requiring cidofovir to control the persistent AdV B3 infection and standard therapy with pulsed steroids. We argue that in the presence of the mosaic tetrasomy 9p, earlier antiviral therapy may have decreased the severity of BO, as this mutation is known to be associated with some degree of immune dysregulation.Adenovirus infections are common in children and may persist as latent infections, with subsequent reactivations during loss of immune control, related to systemic illness arising from other causes. In chronic, reactivated AdV infection with pneumonia, BO is a recognised complication. However, in this case, with the presence of the mosaic tetrasomy 9p mutation, earlier antiviral therapy may have reduced such longer term complications, due to the immune dysregulatory nature of this mutation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634422>Long Term Exposure to Low Ethylene and Storage Temperatures Delays Calyx Senescence and Maintains 'Afourer' Mandarins and Navel Oranges Quality.</a></h1><p>Calyx  and internal quality loss are major physiological causes for the loss of quality in citrus fruit during storage. While the symptoms of calyx senescence are only superficial, it can affect the appearance and consumer acceptability of citrus fruit. In this study, continuous ethylene exposure at different storage temperatures was investigated to assess their effect on calyx senescence and internal qualities in 'Afourer' mandarin and Navel orange fruit during storage. 'Afourer' mandarin fruit were stored at ≤0.001 (equivalent to ethylene-free air), 0.01, 0.1 and 1 µL L of ethylene at either , 10 or 20 °C, whilst in a parallel experiment, Navel oranges were exposed to ≤0.001, 0.1 and 1 µL L ethylene at either 1 or 10 °C. Changes in external and internal postharvest quality parameters were assessed for up to 8 weeks for 'Afourer' mandarins and 10 weeks for Navel oranges. At all storage temperatures, high levels of ethylene were found to increase the level of calyx senescence, weight loss, loss of fruit firmness and respiration rates. Also, there were significant effects of ethylene and storage temperatures on total soluble solids (TSS) content, titratable acidity (TA), and ethanol accumulation in both citrus species. Continuous exposure to high ethylene also significantly reduced vitamin C and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) in 'Afourer' mandarins after 8 weeks of storage. Overall, ethylene treatments had a significant effect on both the external and internal qualities of the fruit during storage. The relationship between ethylene concentrations and storage temperatures demonstrate that lowering atmospheric ethylene levels at reduced storage temperatures maintain fruit quality during long term storage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30373577>Impact of an intelligent chronic disease management system on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Beijing community.</a></h1><p>Rapid demographic and economic changes have made chronic disease the number one health issue in China, contributing to more than 80% of the country's 10.3 million annual deaths and nearly 70% of its total disease burden (Wang et al., Toward a Healthy and Harmonious Life in China: Stemming the Rising Tide of Non-Communicable Diseases, 2011; Yip and Hsiao, Lancet 384: 805-18, 2014). Diabetes is a major contributor to the chronic disease burden and is experienced by nearly 11% of the adult population of China (Yang et al., N Engl J Med 362:1090-101, 2010). In response to the challenges of chronic disease, the Chinese government initiated comprehensive health care reforms nationwide in 2009. A key measure was a hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system for monitoring and reducing chronic diseases and improving the community health service system (Barber et al., Health Policy Plan 29:367-78, 2014). Primary hospitals, such as community health service centers, are the main gatekeepers for management of diabetes and other chronic diseasesin China. In recognition of the need for a more patient-centered approach, the Chinese government has piloted a program incorporating methods of diabetes self-management for chronic care: the Happy Life Club ( et al., Front in Public Health 2:181, 2015). This program is modeled on a similar program developed in Australia (Kelly et al., Aust J Prim Health 9:186-9, 2003). The ICDMS is an important tool in the implementation of patient-centered programs targeting chronic health issues, and its success is determined by factors, such as frequent contact between patients and doctors and effective website training for patients. This retrospective study used de-identified data from the Fangzhuang (Beijing) intelligent chronic disease management system (ICDMS) database to evaluate the effect of an intelligent chronic disease management system on selected Beijing community patients who have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).A comparative study before and after ICDMS implementation was performed to evaluate the effect of ICDMS on the rates of follow-up and laboratory examinations, measurement rates of blood glucose and lipids, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood lipid levels, as well as the corresponding health parameters. Continuous variables and categorical variables were analyzed using paired t-test and McNemar's tests, respectively.A total of 2451 T2DM patients met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Compared with the pre-index period, the laboratory examination, rates of blood glucose and blood lipids increased significantly in the post-index period (p < 0.001). Triglyceride (TC) levels decreased significantly from .22 mmol/L to .11 mmol/L (p < 0.05), and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels increased significantly from 1.35 mmol/L to 1.48 mmol/L (p < 0.05). The control rate of TC increased from 24.86 to 29.76% (p = 0.079). The control rate of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) increased from 12.16 to 13.97% (p = 0.421), while the control rate of HDL-C increased significantly from 68.60 to 78.77%. Importantly, Compared with the patients with HbA1C above 7% in the pre-index period, the mean HbA1c decreased significantly from 7.84 to 6.94%((p < 0.001) in the post-index period, and the control rate of HbA1c was 57.43%.The intelligent chronic disease management system is an effective tool in the management of T2DM and should be promoted by the Community Health Service Center in China as well as in other developing countries.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30756266>Implementing Shared, Standardized Imaging Protocols to Improve Cross-Enterprise Workflow and Quality.</a></h1><p>Value-based imaging requires appropriate utilization and the delivery of consistently high-quality imaging at an acceptable cost. Challenges include developing standardized imaging protocols, ensuring consistent application by technologists, and monitoring quality. These challenges increase as enterprises grow in geographical extent and complexity through mergers or partnerships. Our imaging enterprise includes a university hospital and clinic system, a large county hospital and healthcare system, and a pediatric hospital and health system. Studies across the three systems are interpreted by one large academic radiology group with expertise in various subspecialties. Our goals were as follows: (1) Standardize imaging protocols; (2) adapt the imaging protocols to specific modalities and available equipment; and (3) disseminate this knowledge across all of the sites of care. Our approach involved three components: (1) facilitation of imaging protocol definition across subspecialty radiologist teams; (2) creation of a database which links the clinical imaging protocols to the scanner/machine specific acquisition protocols; and (3) delivery of a protocol library and updates to all users regardless of location. We successfully instituted a process for the development, implementation, and delivery of standardized imaging protocols in a complex, multi-institutional healthcare system. Key elements for success include (1) a Project Champion who is able to articulate the importance of protocol standardization in improving the quality of patient care, (2) strong, effective modality-specific operational committees, (3) a Project Lead to manage the process efficiently, and (4) an electronic publishing of the protocol database to facilitate ease of access and use.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31377612>Characteristics of juglone (-hydroxy-1,4,-naphthoquinone) using voltammetry and spectrophotometric methods.</a></h1><p>The objective of this work was to analyse the antiradical capacity of juglone (-hydroxy-1,4,-naphthoquinone). The influence of oxidation and reduction on juglone was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), as well as spectrophotometric based methods. The role of juglone in oxidation processes, as either an antioxidant in  reactions, was examined. These processes are characterized by a high chemical reactivity in redox. Juglone is irreversibly oxidized in at least one electrode step and reduced quasi-reversibly in at least three electrode steps. These results demonstrate that walnut genotypes have different radical scavenging powers. In addition, on the basis of thermogravimetry, it was demonstrated that -hydroxy-1,4-naphthalenedione has high thermal stability above 500 °C. The generation of reactive oxygen species and activity in redox processes show the properties of naphthoquinones that render these compounds interesting leads for the development of novel biomolecules for potential use in various therapeutic settings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We aim to identify critical differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in white adipose tissue after exercise. We downloaded the gene dataset GSE68161 of C57BL/6 mice from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then, we analyzed the effect of exercise on up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs by GEO2R and performed protein-protein interaction network analyses. We then identified hub-genes in white adipose tissue and crosstalk genes of a single pathway by the STRING database and Cytoscape. In this study, 72 DEGs were screened out, and they mainly function in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and in the primary biological process of fatty acid oxidation regulation. The top  hub-genes screened out were SLC27A1, COX7A1, PPARGC1A, FABP3, and UCP1. The 3 crosstalk genes found were SLC27A1, SLC27A2, and PPARA. These 3 genes might function as a bridge of the PPAR signaling pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway and the insulin resistance pathway. SLC27A1 is critical gene for the interactions of signaling pathways in subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Therefore, further relationships between the  of white adipose and insulin resistance need to be studied.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603562>Examination of laryngeal function of healthy dogs by using sedation protocols with dexmedetomidine.</a></h1><p>To determine the ability to evaluate laryngeal function under sedation with dexmedetomidine alone or in combination with opioids.Randomized, crossover, blinded study.Eight adult research hounds weighing 8 to 22. kg.Dogs were sedated with propofol, dexmedetomidine, dexmedetomidine and butorphanol, or dexmedetomidine and hydromorphone. Digital images were collected with video laryngoscopy before and after doxapram administration. Maximal inspiratory normalized glottal gap (GGA ) and laryngeal motion were compared between and within protocols before and after doxapram by using a difference of least squares mean.Normal laryngeal function was confirmed in all dogs with all protocols except propofol, which resulted in two false positive results. No difference between protocols was detected for predoxapram GGA . Postdoxapram GGA was greater than predoxapram GGA for all four sedation protocols (P ≤ .0030). Compared with propofol, postdoxapram GGA was greater for all three dexmedetomidine protocols (P ≤ .0420).Dexmedetomidine alone or in combination with opioids was an effective sedation protocol for laryngeal examination, producing sufficient immobilization to prevent jaw motion and without affecting arytenoid abduction.Dexmedetomidine sedation does not inhibit normal laryngeal motion.

One such area is urinary tract infection (UTI), which is one of the most common infectious diseases globally and which imposes an immense economic and healthcare burden. Common uropathogenic bacteria have been shown to invade the urothelial wall during acute UTI, forming latent intracellular reservoirs that can evade antimicrobials and the immune response. This behaviour likely facilitates the high recurrence rates after oral antibiotic treatments, which are not able to penetrate the bladder wall and accumulate to an effective concentration. Meanwhile, oral antibiotics may also exacerbate antimicrobial resistance and cause systemic side effects. Using a human urothelial organoid model, we tested the ability of novel ultrasound-activated lipid microbubbles to deliver drugs into the cytoplasm of apical cells. The gas-filled lipid microbubbles were decorated with liposomes containing the non-cell-permeant antibiotic gentamicin and a fluorescent marker. The microbubble suspension was added to buffer at the apical surface of the bladder model before being exposed to ultrasound (1.1 MHz, 2. Mpa, 5500 cycles at 20 ms pulse duration) for 20 s. Our results show that ultrasound-activated intracellular delivery using microbubbles was over 16 times greater than the control group and twice that achieved by liposomes that were not associated with microbubbles. Moreover, no cell damage was detected. Together, our data show that ultrasound-activated microbubbles can safely deliver high concentrations of drugs into urothelial cells, and have the potential to be a more efficacious alternative to traditional oral antibiotic regimes for UTI. This modality of intracellular drug delivery may prove useful in other clinical indications, such as cancer and gene therapy, where such penetration would aid in treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We estimated the annual UK incidence from primary care (PC), emergency attendances (EA), hospital admissions (HA) and deaths.The population was children (0-15 years), across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (NI), with medically attended burns 2013-2015. Routinely collected data sources included PC attendances from Clinical Practice Research Datalink 2013-2015), EAs from Paediatric Emergency Research in the United Kingdom and Ireland (PERUKI, 2014) and National Health Services Wales Informatics Services, HAs from Hospital Episode Statistics, National Services Scotland and Social Services and Public Safety (2014), and mortality from the Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland and NI Statistics and Research Agency 2013-2015. The population denominators were based on Office for National Statistics mid-year population estimates.The annual PC burns attendance was 16.1/10 000 persons at risk (95% CI 15.6 to 16.6); EAs were 35.1/10 000 persons at risk (95% CI 34.7 to 35.) in England and 28.9 (95% CI 27. to 30.3) in Wales. HAs ranged from 6.0/10 000 person at risk (95% CI .9 to 6.2) in England to 3.1 in Wales and Scotland (95% CI 2.7 to 3.8 and 2.7 to 3., respectively) and 2.8 (95% CI 2.4 to 3.4) in NI. In England, Wales and Scotland, 75% of HAs were aged < years.

All required chest compressions for greater than or equal to 2 minutes, were comatose and required mechanical ventilation after return of circulation.Neurobehavioral function was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition at baseline (reflecting precardiac arrest status), and at 3 and 12 months postcardiac arrest, followed by on-site cognitive evaluation. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition norms are 100 (mean) ± 15 (SD); higher scores indicate better function. Analyses evaluated survival, changes in Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition, and cognitive functioning.Twenty-eight of 84 (33%) survived to 12 months (in-hospital cardiac arrest, 19/59 (32%); out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 9/25 [36%]). In-hospital cardiac arrest (but not out-of-hospital cardiac arrest) survival rate was significantly lower compared with the Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest group without precardiac arrest neurobehavioral impairment. Twenty-five survived with decrease in Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition less than or equal to 15 (in-hospital cardiac arrest, 18/59 (31%); out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 7/25 [28%]).

In late August, CDC released recommendations for health care providers regarding e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) based on limited data from the first reported cases (1,2). This report summarizes national surveillance data describing clinical features of more recently reported cases and interim recommendations based on these data for U.S. health care providers caring for patients with suspected or known EVALI. It provides interim guidance for 1) initial clinical evaluation; 2) suggested criteria for hospital admission and treatment; 3) patient follow-up; 4) special considerations for groups at high risk; and ) clinical and public health recommendations. Health care providers evaluating patients suspected to have EVALI should ask about the use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products in a nonjudgmental and thorough manner. Patients suspected to have EVALI should have a chest radiograph (CXR), and hospital admission is recommended for patients who have decreased blood oxygen (O) saturation (<95%) on room air or who are in respiratory distress. Health care providers should consider empiric use of a combination of antibiotics, antivirals, or steroids based upon clinical context. Evidence-based tobacco product cessation strategies, including behavioral counseling, are recommended to help patients discontinue use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients who have been treated for EVALI should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products. CDC recommends that persons should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). At present, CDC recommends persons consider refraining from using e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain nicotine. Irrespective of the ongoing investigation, e-cigarette, or vaping, products should never be used by youths, young adults, or women who are pregnant. Persons who do not currently use tobacco products should not start using e-cigarette, or vaping, products.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30591353>Tumour Seeding in the Tract of Percutaneous Renal Tumour Biopsy: A Report on Seven Cases from a UK Tertiary Referral Centre.</a></h1><p>The role of percutaneous renal tumour biopsy (RTB) in the management of radiological indeterminate renal masses is long established. Patients with small renal masses who have biopsy-proven renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may be offered surgery, ablative therapy, or active surveillance, and RTB can provide diagnostic tissue from patients with metastatic disease who might benefit from systemic therapy. Current guidelines suggest that tumour seeding along the needle tract is anecdotal, but several cases have been reported recently, although some have been associated with lack of a coaxial sheath. We report on seven patients who underwent surgical resection of RCC in our tertiary referral institution following diagnostic RTB between 2014 and 2017 for whom RTB tract seeding by tumour was identified on histological examination of the resection specimen.

Although adipose tissue has been studied for decades, it has been appreciated only in the past  years that extensive arborization of nerve fibres has a dominant role in regulating the function of adipose tissue. This Review summarizes the latest literature, which suggests that adipocytes signal to local sensory nerve fibres in response to perturbations in lipolysis and lipogenesis. Such adipocyte signalling to the central nervous system causes sympathetic output to distant adipose depots and potentially other metabolic tissues to regulate systemic glucose homeostasis. Paracrine factors identified in the past few years that mediate such adipocyte-neuron crosstalk are also reviewed. Similarly, immune cells and endothelial cells within adipose tissue communicate with local nerve fibres to modulate neurotransmitter tone, blood flow, adipocyte differentiation and energy expenditure, including adipose  to produce heat. This understudied field of neurometabolism related to adipose tissue biology has great potential to reveal new mechanistic insights and potential therapeutic strategies for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606590>Association between buprenorphine/naloxone and high-dose opioid analgesic prescribing in Kentucky, 2012-2017.</a></h1><p>Buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is a highly effective treatment for opioid use disorder decreasing illicit opioid use and both all-cause and opioid-involved overdose mortality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing and high-dose opioid analgesic prescribing (HDOAP) over time.This longitudinal study used 2012-2017 Kentucky All Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting data and cross-lagged structural equation analysis. For each quarter-county observation, HDOAP rate (per 1,000 residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions) was used to predict buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing rate at the next quarter, and simultaneously buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing rate was used to predict HDOAP at the next quarter, accounting for baseline socioeconomic status, medical needs for opioid analgesics, and heroin availability.On average, HDOAP rates in Kentucky decreased by more than 10% (p < .0001) and buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing rates increased by more than % (p < .0001) per quarter over the study period. Every one-per-thousand higher HDOAP rate in an earlier quarter was associated with a 0.01/1,000 increase in the buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing rate in a later quarter (p = .009). Conversely, a one-unit higher buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing rate in an earlier quarter was associated with a 0.01/1,000 reduction in the HDOAP rate in a subsequent quarter (p = .017).Our results indicate a significant reciprocal relationship between HDOAP and buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing and a clinically meaningful effect of buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing on reducing HDOAP. Future studies on buprenorphine/naloxone treatment expansion should take into account this bi-directional association in the context of longitudinal data and evaluate for public health benefits beyond the reduction of HDOAP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In that sense, the effects of a UV-C treatment (3 kJ m), compared with non-exposed beans (CTRL), were studied on the sensory and microbial quality, and bioactive and anti-nutritional content of fresh-cut faba beans (cv. ) during storage at  ℃. The effect of a domestic microwaving (3 min, 900 W) on bioactive and anti-nutritional compounds of fresh seeds prior to consumption at each sampling time was also studied.

UV-C did not negatively affect the total antioxidant capacity of samples during storage. The phytic acid and raffinose contents decreased by 30/40%, respectively, after 10 days, without influence of the UV-C treatment. Microwaving reduced the phytic acid and condensed tannins contents by 30% in those samples stored for up to six days, with low microwaving effect in the last storage days.

However, FNDC5, the precursor of irisin, has been paid relatively little attention compared with irisin despite evidence that FNDC5 is associated with the metabolic syndrome, which accounts for one-fourth of the world's adult population and contributes to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Besides N-terminal and C-terminal sequences, the FNDC5 protein contains an irisin domain and a short transmembrane region. FNDC5 has shown to be widely distribute in different tissues and is highly expressed in heart, brain, liver, and skeletal muscle. Clinical studies have demonstrated that FNDC5 is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and dysregulation of FNDC5 will lead to systemic metabolism imbalance and the onset of metabolic disorders. Growing evidence has suggested that FNDC5 gene polymorphisms are related to health and disease in different human populations. Additionally, FNDC5 has been found relevant to the regulation of metabolism and metabolic syndrome through diverse upstream and downstream signaling pathways in experimental studies. The present review summarizes the characteristics, clinical significance, and molecular mechanisms of FNDC5 in metabolic syndrome and proposes a novel concept that FNDC5 is activated by forming a putative ligand-receptor complex. Knowledge about the role of FNDC5 may be translated into drug development and clinical applications for the treatment of metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Years Follow-Up of Drug-Free Cohort Vulnerable for Recurrence.</a></h1><p>An interesting factor explaining recurrence risk in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) may be neuropsychological functioning, i.e., processing of emotional stimuli/information. Negatively biased processing of emotional stimuli/information has been found in both acute and (inconclusively) remitted states of MDD, and may be causally related to recurrence of depression. We aimed to investigate self-referent, memory and interpretation biases in recurrently depressed patients in remission and relate these biases to recurrence. We included 69 remitted recurrent MDD-patients (rrMDD-patients), 35-65 years, with ≥2 episodes, voluntarily free of antidepressant maintenance therapy for at least 4 weeks. We tested self-referent biases with an emotional categorization task, bias in emotional memory by free recall of the emotion categorization task 15 min after completing it, and interpretation bias with a facial expression recognition task. We compared these participants with 43 never-depressed controls matched for age, sex and intelligence. We followed the rrMDD-patients for 2. years and assessed recurrent depressive episodes by structured interview. The rrMDD-patients showed biases toward emotionally negative stimuli, faster responses to negative self-relevant characteristics in the emotional categorization, better recognition of sad faces, worse recognition of neutral faces with more misclassifications as angry or disgusting faces and less misclassifications as neutral faces (0.001 <  < 0.05). Of these, the number of misclassifications as angry and the overall performance in the emotional memory task were significantly associated with the time to recurrence ( ≤ 0.04), independent of residual symptoms and number of previous episodes. In a support vector machine data-driven model, prediction of recurrence-status could best be achieved (relative to observed recurrence-rate) with demographic and childhood adversity parameters (accuracy 78.1%; 1-sided  = 0.002); neuropsychological tests could not improve this prediction. Our data suggests a persisting (mood-incongruent) emotional bias when patients with recurrent depression are in remission. Moreover, these persisting biases might be mechanistically important for recurrence and prevention thereof.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825191>Determinants of elephant foraging behaviour in a coupled human-natural system: Is brown the new green?</a></h1><p>Crop raiding by wildlife poses major threats to both wildlife conservation and human well-being in agroecosystems worldwide. These threats are particularly acute in many parts of Africa, where crop raiders include globally threatened megafauna such as elephants, and where smallholder agriculture is a primary source of human livelihood. One framework for understanding herbivore feeding behaviour, the forage-maturation hypothesis, predicts that herbivores should align their movements with intermediate forage biomass (i.e., peak green-up); this phenomenon is known as "surfing the green wave." Crop-raiding elephants, however, often consume not just foliage, but also fruits and tubers (e.g., maize and potatoes), which generally mature after seasonal peaks in photosynthetic activity. Thus, although elephants have been reported to surf the green wave in natural habitats, they may utilize a different strategy in cultivated landscapes by selecting crops that are " down." We sought to understand the factors that underpin movement of elephants into agricultural landscapes. In Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park, we used movement data from GPS-collared elephants, together with precipitation records, remotely sensed estimates of landscape greenness (NDVI), DNA-based diet analysis, measurements of plant nutritional quality and survey-based metrics of crop availability to understand spatiotemporal variation in elephant crop-raiding behaviour. Elephants tracked peak NDVI while foraging inside the Park. During the dry season, however, when NDVI within the Park declined and availability of mature crops was high, crop raiding increased dramatically, and elephants consistently selected crop plants that were  down while foraging in cultivated landscapes. Crops contained significantly higher digestible energy than wild food plants, but comparable (and sometimes lower) levels of digestible protein, suggesting that this foraging strategy maximized energy rather than protein intake. Our study is the first to combine GPS tracking data with high-resolution diet analysis and community-based reporting of crop availability to reveal fine-scale plasticity in foraging behaviour of elephants at the human-wildlife interface. Our results extend the forage-maturation hypothesis by showing that elephants surf waves of plant brown-down in cultivated landscapes. These findings can aid efforts to reduce human-elephant conflict by enabling wildlife managers to prioritize mitigation actions in time and space with limited resources.© 2019 The Authors.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of post-cardiac arrest hypotension during targeted temperature management following IHCA on survival to discharge.This is a secondary analysis of the therapeutic hypothermia after pediatric cardiac arrest in-hospital (THAPCA-IH) trial. "Early hypotension" was defined as a systolic blood pressure less than the fifth percentile for age and sex for patients not treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or a mean arterial pressure less than fifth percentile for age and sex for patients treated with ECMO during the first 6 h of temperature intervention. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge.Of 299 children, 142 (47%) patients did not receive ECMO and 157 (53%) received ECMO. Forty-two of 142 (29.6%) non-ECMO patients had systolic hypotension. Twenty-three of 157 (14.7%) ECMO patients had mean arterial hypotension. After controlling for confounders of interest, non-ECMO patients who had early systolic hypotension were less likely to survive to hospital discharge (40.% vs. 72%; adjusted OR [aOR] 0.34; 95%CI, 0.12-0.93). There was no difference in survival to discharge by blood pressure groups for children treated with ECMO (30.4% vs. 49.3%; aOR = 0.60; 95%CI, 0.22-1.63).In this secondary analysis of the THAPCA-IH trial, in patients not treated with ECMO, systolic hypotension within 6 h of temperature intervention was associated with lower odds of discharge survival. Blood pressure groups in patients treated with ECMO were not associated with survival to discharge.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Flours containing yellow corn and soybean flours, and soy protein isolate (in a proportion of 2.:1.0:1.0 by weight respectively), cellulose gum, salt, and baking powder were homogeneously mixed followed by the addition of water and kneaded to form a dough. Response surface methodology was used to optimize baking powder levels (0-2.0%), dough sheet thickness (0.7-1.7 mm), and baking time (6-12 min) of the chips baked at 160 °C. Dough sheet thickness and baking time had significant effect on all the examined physical properties (water activity ranged from 0.15 to 0.71, hardness ranged from 377 to 2105 g, and  index ranged from 38.4 to 60.7) ( < 0.05) except fracturability. However, all the variables had a significant quadratic effect on the fracturability (ranged from 1 to 23 peaks) of the chips ( < 0.01). The chips prepared from 1.2% baking powder, 1.2 mm dough sheet thickness, and baked for 9.0 min were considered the best and were significantly lower in the estimated GI value (48.8) ( < 0.05) when compared to non-soy corn chips (75.0). These baked protein-enriched corn chips developed could be considered as protein-rich and low glycemic index healthy snacks.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30297292>Factors Associated with Adverse Outcomes among Febrile Young Infants with Invasive Bacterial Infections.</a></h1><p>To determine factors associated with adverse outcomes among febrile young infants with invasive bacterial infections (IBIs) (ie, bacteremia and/or bacterial meningitis).Multicenter, retrospective cohort study (July 2011-June 2016) of febrile infants ≤60 days of age with pathogenic bacterial growth in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Subjects were identified by query of local microbiology laboratory and/or electronic medical record systems, and clinical data were extracted by medical record review. Mixed-effect logistic regression was employed to determine clinical factors associated with 30-day adverse outcomes, which were defined as death, neurologic sequelae, mechanical ventilation, or vasoactive medication receipt.Three hundred fifty infants met inclusion criteria; 279 (79.7%) with bacteremia without meningitis and 71 (20.3%) with bacterial meningitis. Forty-two (12.0%) infants had a 30-day adverse outcome: 29 of 71 (40.8%) with bacterial meningitis vs 13 of 279 (4.7%) with bacteremia without meningitis (36.2% difference, 95% CI 25.1%-48.0%; P < .001). On adjusted analysis, bacterial meningitis (aOR 16.3, 95% CI 6.-41.0; P < .001), prematurity (aOR 7.1, 95% CI 2.6-19.7; P < .001), and ill appearance (aOR 3.8, 95% CI 1.6-9.1; P = .002) were associated with adverse outcomes. Among infants who were born at term, not ill appearing, and had bacteremia without meningitis, only 2 of 184 (1.1%) had adverse outcomes, and there were no deaths.Among febrile infants ≤60 days old with IBI, prematurity, ill appearance, and bacterial meningitis (vs bacteremia without meningitis) were associated with adverse outcomes. These factors can inform clinical decision-making for febrile young infants with IBI.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies have shown that induction of brown-like adipocytes, also referred to as beige or brite cells, in white adipose tissue (WAT) results in the release of excess energy through mitochondrial heat production via uncoupling protein 1. This has potential a therapeutic strategy for obesity and related diseases as well as classical brown adipocytes. In our previous studies, we found that artepillin C (ArtC, 10 mg/kg body weight), a characteristic constituent of Brazilian propolis, significantly induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in inguinal WAT (iWAT) of mice. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that curcumin (Cur, 4. mg/kg) also significantly induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in mice. The combined administration of several food-derived factors can enhance their bioactivity and reduce their required functional doses. In this study, we showed that co-administration of Cur and ArtC at lower doses (Cur, 1. mg/kg; ArtC,  mg/kg) additively induce brown-like adipocyte development in mouse iWAT. Moreover, this induction is associated with the localized production of norepinephrine following accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages in iWAT. These findings suggest that co-administration of Cur and ArtC is significantly effective to reduce the dose and enhance the formation of brown-like adipocyte via a unique molecular mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471513>What We're Learning About Medicaid Transformation.</a></h1><p>Each state's health care transformation journey is unique.

The fortified biscuits had higher protein (26.36%), fiber (52.90%), and ash (6.00%) contents and a lower total fat (.64%) content compared to the control biscuits. The in vitro starch digestibility and predicted glycemic index (pGI) decreased in the fortified biscuits by 18.95% and 6.18%, respectively, while the in vitro protein digestibility increased by 3.73%, corresponding to the increased levels of defatted mussel powder present. The spread ratio and hardness of the fortified biscuits also increased significantly. The color values of the fortified biscuits after the incorporation of different levels of defatted mussel powder showed significant changes, with a darkening of the biscuit surface and a lowered  index compared to the control biscuits. Results of the sensory quality evaluation showed that incorporation of defatted mussel powder into the biscuit mix of up to 15% showed no significant differences in liking scores in terms of color, overall appearance; whereas, the flavor and overall acceptability scores were significantly lower than the control biscuits. Overall, defatted mussel powder can be successfully incorporated into biscuit mixes to enrich the protein, fiber, and antioxidant contents of the biscuits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30342056>ERβ activation in obesity improves whole body metabolism via adipose tissue function and enhanced mitochondria biogenesis.</a></h1><p>Estrogens play a key role in the distribution of adipose tissue and have their action by binding to both estrogen receptors (ER), α and β. Although ERβ has a role in the energy metabolism, limited data of the physiological mechanism and metabolic response involved in the pharmacological activation of ERβ is available.For clinical relevance, non-ovariectomized female mice were subjected to high fat diet together with pharmacological (DIP - 4-(2-(3,-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)-1H-indol-3-yl)phenol) interventions to ERβ selective activation. The physiological mechanism was assessed in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, and oral glucose and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test before and after DIP treatment. Liver and adipose tissue metabolic response was measured in HFD + vehicle and HFD + DIP by stable isotope, RNA sequencing and protein content.HFD-fed females treated with DIP had a tissue-specific response towards ERβ selective activation. The metabolic profile showed an improved fasting glucose level, insulin sensitivity and reduced liver steatosis.Our data demonstrate that selective activation of ERβ exerts a tissue-specific activity which promotes a beneficial effect on whole body metabolic response to obesity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Population densities were 1.0, 1.25, 1., and 1.75 plants m . After being harvested at 300, 360, or 420 days after planting, cassava were minimally processed and stored at  ± 2°C. It was observed that superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD) play key roles in the tolerance of young roots to . Planting density, however, does not appear to be a key factor modulating the activity of the enzymes studied. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Younger harvested cassava roots, harvested at 300 days, are more tolerant to enzymatic . This appears to be in part due to enzymatic activity modulation of the SOD, CAT, and POD enzymes. In addition, it has been demonstrated that agronomic techniques aimed at increasing productivity, such as increasing the planting density of cassava, do not alter the biomarkers of postharvest quality. In summary, evidence that field management may be an efficient approach to improving the conservation of minimally processed cassava is provided. We believe that the findings of this paper will be of great interest regarding the influence of field management on the postharvest quality of freshly cut cassava and will also provide applicable results relating to its production chain.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586139>Assessment of the Timing of Milestone Clinical Events in Patients With Epidermolysis Bullosa From North America.</a></h1><p>Children with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) comprise a rare population with high morbidity and mortality. An improved understanding of the clinical trajectory of patients with EB, including age at time of clinical diagnosis and major clinical events, is needed to refine best practices and improve quality of life and clinical outcomes for patients with EB.To describe demographics, clinical characteristics, milestone diagnostic and clinical events (such as initial esophageal dilation), and outcomes in patients with EB using the Epidermolysis Bullosa Clinical Characterization and Outcomes Database and to determine what characteristics may be associated with overall EB severity and/or disease progression.This cohort study included data on patients with EB who were enrolled in the Epidermolysis Bullosa Clinical Characterization and Outcomes Database from January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2017; 17 participating EB centers in the United States and Canada contributed data to this study.Type of EB, including recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB), dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB), and epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS).Demographic information, clinical characteristics (including age at onset of signs of EB and subsequent clinical diagnosis), types of diagnostic testing performed, and milestone clinical events for patients with RDEB.Of 644 enrolled patients from 17 sites included in this study, 323 were male (50.2%), with a mean (SD) age of 14.4 (11.7) years; 283 (43.9%) had RDEB, 194 (30.1%) had EBS, 104 (16.2%) had DDEB, and 63 (9.8%) had JEB. Signs of disease were present at birth in 202 patients with RDEB (71.4%), 39 with JEB (61.9%), 60 with DDEB (57.7%), and 74 with EBS (38.1%). For those with signs of disease at birth, a clinical diagnosis was made at the time of birth in 135 patients with RDEB (67.0%), 31 with DDEB (52.6%), 35 with EBS, (47.3%) and 18 with JEB (46.2%). Patients with JEB had the highest rate of any confirmatory testing (51 of 63 [81.0%]), followed by RDEB (218 of 283 [77.0%]), DDEB (71 of 104 [68.3%]), and EBS (100 of 194 [51.%]). For all types of EB, both electron microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy were performed at younger ages than genetic analysis.

Use of this model results in dramatically reduced waits for diagnostic consultation, high levels of family/provider satisfaction, and reductions in referrals to overtaxed tertiary diagnostic centers. The current study extends this work by providing data before/after implementation of a streamlined model across a diverse range of PC clinics that provide health care to rural and underserved communities.The streamlined assessment involved record/history review, diagnostic interview, standard rating scales, and an interactive screening tool. Eighty children between the ages of 19 and 47 months were seen across  different clinics. Data were collected through chart review.Implementation of streamlined model resulted in a significant decrease in latency to diagnostic conclusion from a mean of 144.7 to 49.9 days. Children were likely to experience a greater reduction in wait times if they were a PC patient versus a non-PC patient.Results show significant reduction in wait times for ASD diagnostic decisions across both PC and non-PC patients. By reducing waits and identifying concerns more efficiently, we may increase the ability of families to access early intervention and support services.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31477983>Effects of heat and shallot ( L.) supplementation on nutritional quality and enzymatic  of apple juice.</a></h1><p>This study investigated the effects of shallot ( L.) supplementation on improved nutritional quality and  index of apple juice, specifically by comparing between heated (96 °C, 30 min) and unheated apple juice.

Examples from the literature show that processed potato- and cereal-based products are two major food types that seem to contribute the highest amounts of acrylamide to the diet worldwide. To meet both the demand for gluten-free products and the interest in alternative grains, we previously developed recipes for flatbreads using a variety of different grains. In this study, we determined the acrylamide content of 15 experimental flatbreads made from a variety of flours and 21 commercial flatbreads. The application of a validated, highly sensitive HPLC/MS method revealed that flatbreads made with the following flours baked at 195. °C for 2 min had very low (<10 μg/kg) levels of acrylamide: brown rice, buckwheat, cornmeal, millet, oat, and quinoa. The acrylamide levels of the following flatbreads were 14 to 59 μg/kg: rye, sorghum, soy, wheat, commercial pita, pita crackers, pizza, naan, and lavash. Wheat-based matzo breads, which are rapidly baked to a crisp texture at high heat (∼400 °C), contained 101 to 504 μg/kg acrylamide. Potato-based products were some of the highest of the products tested, ranging from 153 (potato pancakes) to 2,070 (potato-containing gluten-free matzos) μg/kg acrylamide. Except for the potato-containing products, the flatbreads made in this study were lower in acrylamide content (<3 to 21.3 μg/kg) than any of the commercial products tested. Of these experimental flatbreads, wheat- and sorghum-based products were the highest. Flatbreads from alternative grains can result in gluten-free products with high nutritional value and less acrylamide. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Acrylamide formation is dependent on both the composition of the food product and the method of cooking. Flatbreads have the potential to be high in acrylamide due to cooking methods which lead to the development of desirable  products. Flatbreads developed in this study using alternative and ancient grains were mostly lower in acrylamide content than their wheat counterpart, suggesting that they can serve as a low-acrylamide, gluten-free functional food.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30353562>Kinetic modeling of high-pressure induced inactivation of polyphenol oxidase in sugarcane juice (Saccharum officinarum).</a></h1><p>Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) is the main enzyme in sugarcane juice associated with rapid  and degradation of organoleptic properties. High-pressure processing (HPP) (300-600 MPa) of sugarcane juice in combination with moderate temperatures (30-60 °C) for different processing times (10-25 min) has shown promising results in minimizing PPO activity while preserving the juice's freshness.A maximum PPO inactivation of 98% was achieved at 600 MPa/60 °C/25 min, while the corresponding value for thermal treatment at 0.1 MPa/60 °C was only 66%. The nonlinearity in the inactivation data was well described by the Weibull distribution model with a high adjusted R and reduced χ values at all levels of pressure and temperature. The PPO inactivation data were fitted at shape parameter, β = 1 (log linear) and β ≠ 1. A refitted Weibull model was used to predict kinetic parameters such as the inactivation rate constants (k), activation energy (E ) and activation volume (V ), which govern PPO inactivation in HPP-treated sugarcane juice. A secondary kinetic model was formulated to predict the k values as a function of pressure (P) and temperature (T), incorporating E and V .Combined high-pressure and temperature processing has been considered a reliable alternative to conventional heat treatment for inhibiting PPO activity in sugarcane juice. While the isothermal inactivation of PPO followed first-order kinetics, inclusion of high pressure resulted in a strong deviation from log linear kinetics. Identification of suitable kinetic models describing these inactivation processes is expected to aid product development and process control of high-pressure processed sugarcane juice. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31347616>Sourdough technology as a novel approach to overcome quality losses in sugar-reduced cakes.</a></h1><p>Sugar reduction in sweet baked goods is one of the most popular trends on the food market. However, reducing sugar without lowering the product quality with respect to sweetness, texture and microbial shelf life is challenging. Sugar alcohols are one group of sugar replacers which maintain the bulk and contribute to sweetness. Nevertheless, alternative approaches, particularly those that are seen as 'clean label', are highly demanded. Hence, the natural, in situ production of mannitol in a sourdough system was performed and its potential as a functional ingredient to improve the product quality of a sugar-reduced cake was investigated. A full sugar cake (C1), a 50% sugar-reduced cake with wheat starch (C2) or with commercially available mannitol (C3) were considered as controls. The substitution of sugar by wheat starch or mannitol caused lower specific volume (-15.%; -10.7%), a harder crumb (+17.1 N; +4.4 N), less , a shorter microbial shelf life (-.7 days; -4.3 days) and poorer sensory properties. The incorporation of sourdough in C2 improved the pasting properties by decreasing the peak viscosity. Moreover, it resulted in a similar specific volume to the full-sugar control, contributed to significantly softer crumb (-8.6 N) and increased  compared to C2. Sensory evaluation revealed an increased sweetness perception (+93%), aroma (+30%) and flavour (+25.%) by the incorporation of sourdough. Although sourdough incorporation improved sugar-reduced cakes, the quality characteristics of the full-sugar control could not be achieved in this study. In conclusion, the addition of sourdough in amounts lower than 10% can be considered a useful tool to improve specific volume, crumb structure, colour, taste and flavour, as well as shelf life of sugar-reduced cakes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31064103>Fermented  Extract Prevents Hepatosteatosis and Adipocyte Hypertrophy in High Fat Diet-Fed Mice.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) is characterized by accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver. The objective of this study was to evaluate protective effects of fermented  extract by  ON188 (ONE) against hepatosteatosis and obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed HFD mixed with ONE for four weeks and its effects on hepatosteatosis and obesity were examined. Although ONE did not change food intake, it reduced body weights of mice at administration dose of 200 mg/kg/day. Activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) as plasma parameters were reduced by ONE in a dose-dependent manner. Hepatic lipid droplets and triglyceride (TG) levels were also reduced by ONE due to upregulation of fatty acid oxidizing genes such as carnithine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1) and peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor α(PPARα) mediated by induction of sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2). In epididymal fat tissue, sizes of adipocytes were significantly reduced by ONE in a dose-dependent manner. This is mainly due to suppression of lipogenesis and upregulation of adipocyte  genes. Collectively, these results suggest that fermented ONE can activate fatty acid oxidation via SPHK2 in the liver. It can also suppress lipogenesis and activate  in adipose tissue. Thus, ONE might have potential to be used for the development of functional foods against liver dysfunction and obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31510307>Power efficient optical frequency comb generation using laser gain switching and dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator.</a></h1><p>We propose and experimentally demonstrate a power efficient dual-stage optical frequency comb using laser gain switching followed by a dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator (DD-MZM).

The thermal processing induces many chemical reactions, such as the Maillard reaction, which causes the color change from white to dark brown. Garlic contains a variety of amino acids, and the effect of each amino acid on  is not fully understood. This work investigated the effect and mechanism of free amino acids on the  of black garlic using model solutions containing garlic neutral polysaccharide, hydrolyzed garlic neutral polysaccharide, fructose, and free amino acids.A significant increase in reducing sugar was detected when garlic neutral polysaccharide was heated with glycine. The  intensity of garlic neutral polysaccharide-glycine model solution was obviously higher after heating at 80 °C compared with that of garlic neutral polysaccharide solution. The model solution containing histidine had the greatest  degree. The histidine model has a stable pH value, and almost no -hydroxymethylfurfural (-HMF) was detected.Amino acid can promote the breaking of the garlic neutral polysaccharide chain and can react with the fructose generated to form . Histidine has the greatest effect on the , because histidine could eliminate the inhibiting effect of organic acid on Maillard reaction due to the buffer ability, and histidine had high reactivity in the late stage of Maillard reaction. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906941>Mitigation of 3-deoxyglucosone and -hydroxymethylfurfural in brown fermented milk via an alternative  process based on the hydrolysis of endogenous lactose.</a></h1><p>During the conventional production of brown fermented milk (BFM), unhealthy substances (3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG), methylglyoxal (MGO), and -hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)) are generated during the Maillard  step. Here, an alternative  process based on the hydrolysis of endogenous lactose was established. Compared with the conventional process, 3-DG and HMF were decreased by .91 mg kg-1 and 0.39 mg kg-1 in the brown milk base under the alternative  process, and thereafter, 3-DG and HMF were decreased by 54.% and 65.0% in BFM. Investigation into the formation of 3-DG, MGO, and HMF in different chemical models showed that different sugars lead to different Maillard reaction products and  rates, contributing to the mitigation of 3-DG and HMF. Apart from the mitigation of unhealthy Maillard compounds, hydrolyzing lactose and avoiding the addition of external glucose make the alternative  process a theoretical and practical basis for improving the quality and safety of BFM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31192450>Genetic history of the population of Crete.</a></h1><p>The medieval history of several populations often suffers from scarcity of contemporary records resulting in contradictory and sometimes biased interpretations by historians. This is the situation with the population of the island of Crete, which remained relatively undisturbed until the Middle Ages when multiple wars, invasions, and occupations by foreigners took place. Historians have considered the effects of the occupation of Crete by the Arabs (in the 9th and 10th centuries C.E.) and the Venetians (in the 13th to the 17th centuries C.E.) to the local population. To obtain insights on such effects from a genetic perspective, we studied representative samples from 17 Cretan districts using the Illumina 1 million or 2. million arrays and compared the Cretans to the populations of origin of the medieval conquerors and settlers. Highlights of our findings include (1) small genetic contributions from the Arab occupation to the extant Cretan population, (2) low genetic contribution of the Venetians to the extant Cretan population, and (3) evidence of a genetic relationship among the Cretans and Central, Northern, and Eastern Europeans, which could be explained by the settlement in the island of northern origin tribes during the medieval period. Our results show how the interaction between genetics and the historical record can help shed light on the historical record.© 2019 The Authors.

Identifying and understanding the mechanism of inhibition of polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) in lentil sprouts may offer inexpensive alternatives to prevent . This study focused on the biochemical characteristics of PPOs from stored lentil sprouts, providing data that may be directly implemented in improving the consumer quality of sprouts. The purification resulted in approximately 25-fold enrichment of two PPO isoenzymes (PPO I and PPO II). The optimum pH for total PPOs, as well as for PPO I and PPO II isoenzymes, was 4.-., 4.-.0, and ., respectively. The optimal temperature for PPOs was 35 °C. Total PPOs and the PPO I and PPO II isoenzymes had the greatest affinity for catechol ( = 1.32, 1.76, and 0.94 mM, respectively). Ascorbic acid was the most effective in the inhibition of dark color formation by total PPOs, and showed ca. 62%, 43%, and 24% inhibition at 20-, 2-, and 0.2-mM concentrations. Ascorbic acid, l-cysteine, and sodium metabisulfite (20 mM) significantly inhibited color development in the reactions catalyzed by both isoenzymes of PPO. Ba, Fe, and Mn (10 mM) completely inhibited PPO activity. This study of the effect of antibrowning compounds and cations on PPO activity provides data that can be used to protect lentil sprouts against enzymatic  during storage and processing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955672>Nutritional, phytochemical, functional and sensorial attributes of Syzygium cumini L. pulp incorporated pasta.</a></h1><p>Nutritional, phytochemical and antioxidant potential of wheat pasta was enhanced by incorporation of S. cumini pulp (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40%). Incorporation of fruit pulp remarkably elevated the antioxidant activity (.76 ± 0.02 to 10.20 ± 0.01%), β-carotene (1336 ± 1.84 to 7624 ± 1.57 µg/100 g), total phenolic content (111.2 ± 0.08 to 176.3 ± 0.84 mg GAE/100 g), dietary fiber (7.08 ± 0.01 to 16.6 ± 0.03%) and ash content (0.59 ± 0.01 to 2.96 ± 0.10%). Though with addition of pulp, gruel loss was increased, but it was within acceptable limit i.e. below 10%. Cooking time and pasting temperature of pasta was increased with higher amount of pulp incorporation. Lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) of the product were decreased with incremental incorporation of pulp while redness (a*) was increased. On the basis of physical, phytochemical and sensory parameters, pasta with 30% pulp was found to be most acceptable with the overall acceptability of (8.1 ± 0.28).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These PMs could be used as high-viscosity food ingredients. Casein, present as a contaminant in whey protein powders, has been shown to become incorporated into the PMs. In this study, we investigated the effect of adding increasing amounts of sodium caseinate to whey protein powders on the formation of PMs during DH at 100 °C for 36 h. In addition, we studied PM formation during DH of a micellar casein-enriched milk protein powder (Casmic). The  index of the dry-heated powders, and the size and water content of the microparticles were also characterized. We confirmed that sodium caseinate was incorporated into the PMs. The highest PM D[4,3] values (270 μm) were observed for powders with around 40% caseinate. Powders without added caseinate displayed D[4,3] values of 150 μm. The yield of conversion of proteins into PMs increased from 0.6 to 0.8 g/g with caseinate addition, whereas the amount of water entrapped in the PMs decreased from around 30 to 20 g/g. PMs were also formed by DH of the Casmic powder, but these particles were smaller, with sizes of around 80 μm. In conclusion, our study shows that the process of DH at pH 9. could be applied to all milk proteins to obtain PMs with functional properties that could be used in the food industry.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The changes of composition and color parameters of Chinese bayberry wines were studied during 70 days of storage in the dark at three different temperatures (4, 25 and 37 °C). The L, a, b, anthocyanins, total phenols, and total flavonoids decreased along with the increase of polymeric pigments at all temperatures while -Hydroxymethylfurfural and  index increased only at 37 °C. The degradation of anthocyanins followed a first-order kinetic model. No furfurals and ascorbic acid were detected at all temperatures during storage. Wines stored at higher temperature showed higher polymeric pigments. The result probably indicated phenols especially anthocyanins and polymeric pigments seem to be main factors than Maillard reaction in the color changes of Chinese bayberry wines during storage.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Such processes are divided into direct photolysis, where a molecule is transformed following sunlight absorption, and indirect photochemistry, where naturally occurring photosensitizers absorb sunlight and produce a range of transient species that can transform dissolved molecules (or inactivate microorganisms). Photochemistry is usually favored in thoroughly illuminated shallow waters, while the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) acts as a switch between different photochemical pathways (direct photolysis, and indirect photochemistry triggered by different transient species). Various phenomena connected with climate change (water , changing precipitations) may affect water DOC and water depth, with implications for the kinetics of photoreactions and the associated transformation pathways. The latter are important because they often produce peculiar intermediates, with particular health and environmental impacts. Further climate-induced effects with photochemical implications are shorter ice-cover seasons and enhanced duration of summer stratification in lakes, as well as changes in the flow velocity of rivers that affect the photodegradation time scale. This contribution aims at showing how the different climate-related phenomena can affect photoreactions and which approaches can be followed to quantitatively describe these variations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880304>Activin E enhances insulin sensitivity and thermogenesis by activating brown/beige adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Activin E, a secreted peptide encoded by the inhibin/activin βE subunit gene, is a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, which is predominantly expressed in the liver. Recent reports have suggested that activin E plays a role in energy homeostasis as a hepatokine. Here, using transgenic mice overexpressing activin E under the control of the β-actin promoter, we demonstrate that activin E controls energy metabolism through brown/beige adipocytes. The glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test showed that the insulin sensitivity was improved in the transgenic mice. Furthermore, the mice had a high body temperature compared with wild-type mice. The transgenic brown adipose tissue and mesenteric white adipose tissue showed upregulation of uncoupling protein 1, which enables energy dissipation as heat by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation from ATP production. Present results indicate that activin E activates energy expenditure through brown/beige adipocyte activation, suggesting that activin E has high potential for obesity therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30396377>Comparison of Dexmedetomidine-Ketamine-Midazolam and Isoflurane for Anesthesia of Black-tailed Prairie Dogs ().</a></h1><p>Few studies evaluate anesthesia in black-tailed prairie dogs (). Isoflurane inhalant anesthesia is used in this species most commonly, but injectable protocols are poorly described. Here we compared the physiologic effects, including anesthetic depth, vital signs, and hematologic changes, of anesthetic protocols using isoflurane or a combination of dexmedetomidine, ketamine, and midazolam in black-tailed prairie dogs. In a randomized, complete crossover study design, intact male black-tailed prairie dogs ( = 9; age, 6 mo) were anesthetized by using a combination of dexmedetomidine (0.25 mg/kg IM), ketamine (40 mg/kg IM), and midazolam (1. mg/kg IM). For reversal, atipamezole (0.15 mg/kg) and flumazenil (0.05 mg/kg) were administered 45 min after induction. For comparison, isoflurane was administered at % in 100% oxygen at  L/min in an anesthetic induction chamber, followed by maintenance isoflurane 2% in 2 L/min oxygen through a tight-fitting facemask for 45 min. Induction and recovery time, respiratory rate, heart rate, body temperature, SpO₂, indirect blood pressure, and reflexes were monitored every  min during the anesthetic period. Blood samples for venous blood gases, PCV, and refractometric total protein were obtained from the cranial vena cava at  min and 45 min. Both protocols appeared to achieve safe and effective anesthesia. Except for blood pressure, all vital signs differed between the 2 treatments. Isoflurane anesthesia resulted in a slightly longer induction and lower respiratory rate and body temperature but increased likelihood of absent reflexes. DKM anesthesia resulted in a faster induction and less hypothermia but also prolonged recovery and lower heart rate and SpO₂ readings. These findings suggest that isoflurane provides a more stable and consistent anesthetic plane, whereas dexmedetomidine-ketamine-midazolam anesthesia may be an effective alternative for short procedures that require fast induction and limited analgesia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30681749>Clinical photography: Attitudes among dental students in two dental institutions.</a></h1><p>Clinical photography is an important tool in teaching, clinical practice and academia especially for mucosal pathologies. Our aim was to examine differences in attitude towards clinical photography for mucosal pathologies among students.Questionnaires about clinical photography were completed by students in dental teaching hospitals in Birmingham (UK) and in Israel (ISR). The questionnaires focussed on the perceived value of clinical photography for a number of purposes and also explored perceived barriers to clinical photography and technology in general. The two departments have different access to clinical photography; in the United Kingdom a separate dedicated photography unit takes all the photographs, whereas in ISR the clinicians take their own photographs. Pearson Chi-squared tests determined statistical significance between categorical variables (P < 0.05).Among the 163 respondents, there were no significant differences in the value of photography between countries or genders. The participants felt that the aims of photography included: teaching (99.4%), monitoring premalignancy (97.6%) and clinician communication (95.8%). More than 90% thought photography should be used for dysplasia and erosive lichen planus cases. Respondents from ISR were more in favour of photographing pathologies including simple leukoplakia, reticular lichen planus, vesiculobullous or pigmented lesions (P < 0.001 compared to the UK). Overall, the main reasons for not using photography were time constraints (25.%) and access (21.8%).This study highlights a favourable attitude towards clinical photography for various teaching and clinical indications thereby demonstrating its importance. In order to maximise the benefits of clinical photography, access should be simplified.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Starch dough systems were fried at five temperatures between 150 and 190 °C and for , 7, 9, 11 and 13 min. The furan content was quantified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, while the corresponding images were simultaneously obtained and processed in order to extract 2914 features. Good furan content predictions were obtained using computer vision image chromatic features using correlation coefficient of prediction (R = 0.86). However, the best prediction correlation was obtained using the image textural features (R = 0.93), when the number of features was reduced to 10 by algorithms applications. These results suggest that furan content in fried dough systems can be predicted using features of computer vision images.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic drugs, which activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) nuclear receptor, are potent stimuli for adipocyte  yet fail to induce  expression in mouse adipocytes. In contrast,  is one of the most strongly TZD-induced transcripts in human adipocytes, although not in cells from all individuals. Two putative PPARγ binding sites exist near the gene's transcription start site (TSS) in human but not mouse adipocytes. The -4 kb upstream site falls in a segmental duplication of a nearly identical intronic region +2. kb downstream of the TSS, and this duplication occurred in the primate lineage and not in other mammals, like mice. PPARγ binding and gene activation occur via this upstream duplicated site, thus explaining the species difference. Furthermore, this functional upstream PPARγ site exhibits genetic variation among people, with 1 SNP allele disrupting a PPAR response element and giving less activation by PPARγ and TZDs. In addition to this upstream variant that determines PPARγ regulation of  in adipocytes, distinct variants downstream of the TSS have strong effects on  expression in human fat as well as other tissues. A haplotype of 7 tightly linked downstream SNP alleles is associated with very low  expression and correspondingly high DNA methylation at the TSS. These  low-expression variants may account for human genetic associations in this region with obesity as well as neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608078>Diurnal Harvest Cycle and Sap Composition Affect Under-Skin  in 'Honey Gold' Mango Fruit.</a></h1><p>Under-skin  (USB) is an unsightly physiological disorder that afflicts 'Honey Gold' mango fruit. Under-skin  symptoms develop after harvest upon the interaction of physical abrasion and physiological chilling stresses. Less understood preharvest and/or harvest factors may also influence fruit susceptibility to USB. In this study, we examined the impact of harvest time during the diurnal cycle and fruit sap components on USB development. Fruits were harvested at 4- to 6-h intervals, lightly abraded with sandpaper to simulate vibration damage during refrigerated road transport, held at 12 ± 1°C for 6 days, transported to the research facilities and ripened before USB assessment. Spurt and ooze sap from the fruit were collected at each harvest time. The samples were separated and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fruit harvested at 10:00, 14:00 and 18:00 h had 3- to -fold higher incidence of USB than did those picked at 22:00, 2:00 and 6:00 h. Sap concentrations of the key aroma volatile compounds 2-carene, 3-carene, α-terpinene, -cymene, limonene and α-terpinolene were higher for fruit harvested at 14:00 h compared to those picked at other times. In the fruits harvested in the afternoon, abraded skin treated with spurt sap sampled at 14:00 h had 14.3- and 29.0-fold higher incidence and severity, respectively, of induced  than did those treated with sap collected at 6:00 h. The results showed that fruit harvested in the afternoon were more susceptible to USB than those picked at night or in early morning. The diurnal variation in fruit sensitivity was evidently associated with specific compositional differences in sap phytotoxicity. Topical application to the fruit skin of pure terpinolene and limonene resulted in induced USB damage, whereas pure carene and distilled water did not. Microscopy examination showed that while skin damage caused by pure terpinolene and limonene was not identical to USB per se, similarities suggested that sap components cause USB under inductive commercial conditions. Considered collectively, these findings suggest that night and early morning harvesting will reduce USB and thus improve the postharvest quality of Honey Gold mango fruit.Copyright © 2019 San, Hofman, Joyce, Macnish, Marques, Webb, Li and Smyth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30962591>SUCNR1 controls an anti-inflammatory program in macrophages to regulate the metabolic response to obesity.</a></h1><p>Succinate is a signaling metabolite sensed extracellularly by succinate receptor 1 (SUNCR1). The accumulation of succinate in macrophages is known to activate a pro-inflammatory program; however, the contribution of SUCNR1 to macrophage phenotype and function has remained unclear. Here we found that activation of SUCNR1 had a critical role in the anti-inflammatory responses in macrophages. Myeloid-specific deficiency in SUCNR1 promoted a local pro-inflammatory phenotype, disrupted glucose homeostasis in mice fed a normal chow diet, exacerbated the metabolic consequences of diet-induced obesity and impaired adipose-tissue  in response to cold exposure. Activation of SUCNR1 promoted an anti-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages and boosted the response of these cells to type 2 cytokines, including interleukin-4. Succinate decreased the expression of inflammatory markers in adipose tissue from lean human subjects but not that from obese subjects, who had lower expression of SUCNR1 in adipose-tissue-resident macrophages. Our findings highlight the importance of succinate-SUCNR1 signaling in determining macrophage polarization and assign a role to succinate in limiting inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537967>Optimization of High Intensity Ultrasound Treatment of Proso Millet Bran to Improve Physical and Nutritional Quality.</a></h1><p>Millet is an unexploited cereal with potential in the food industry due to its nutritional value and resistance to harsh climate conditions. Nutritious millet byproducts have a potential application in the development of functional cereal products, but require processing in order to improve their physical and nutritional quality. Therefore, we investigated high intensity ultrasound as a pretreatment to increase the amount of freely available bioactives from proso millet bran. We also analysed the effect of high intensity ultrasound on enzymatic browning, water retention and protein digestibility, which are crucial for the utilization in the bakery and pasta industry. A 15% millet bran suspension in water was treated with 400-W ultrasound probe for , 12. or 20 min, with the 60, 80 or 100% amplitude. High intensity ultrasound treatment with 80% amplitude for 12. min improved most significantly the nutritive value; the antioxidant activity measured by FRAP test increased by 15% (p<0.05), and total phenolic content by 16% (p<0.05). Still, the impact on the increase of water-soluble and ethanol-insoluble dietary fibre by 38% was evident after the treatment for 20 min at 100% amplitude. High intensity ultrasound treatment at 100% amplitude for  min caused the largest improvements in water retention and limited browning of the sample. High intensity ultrasound treatment activated polyphenol oxidase, regardless of the applied heating of the sample. Due to its ambiguous impact on proso millet bran characteristics, the treatment required an optimization, which showed that the optimal pretreatment of a 15% millet bran suspension in water is at 100% amplitude for 9.3 min.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117920>Sphenopalatine Ganglion Stimulation to Augment Cerebral Blood Flow.</a></h1><p>Background and Purpose- Many patients with acute ischemic stroke are not eligible for thrombolysis or mechanical reperfusion therapies due to contraindications, inaccessible vascular occlusions, late presentation, or large infarct core. Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) stimulation to enhance collateral flow and stabilize the blood-brain barrier offers an alternative, potentially more widely deliverable, therapy. Methods- In a randomized, sham-controlled, double-masked trial at 41 centers in 7 countries, patients with anterior circulation ischemic stroke not treated with reperfusion therapies within 24 hours of onset were randomly allocated to active SPG stimulation or sham control. The primary efficacy outcome was improvement beyond expectations on the modified Rankin Scale of global disability at 90 days (sliding dichotomy), assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population. The initial planned sample size was 660 patients, but the trial was stopped early when technical improvements in device placement occurred, so that analysis of accumulated experience could be conducted to inform a successor trial. Results- Among 303 enrolled patients, 253 received at least one active SPG or sham stimulation, constituting the modified intention-to-treat population (153 SPG stimulation and 100 sham control). Age was median 73 years (interquartile range, 64-79), 52.6% were female, deficit severity on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was median 11 (interquartile range, 9-15), and time from last known well median 18.6 hours (interquartile range, 14.-22.). For the primary outcome, improved 3-month disability beyond expectations, rates in the SPG versus sham treatment groups were 49.7% versus 40.0%; odds ratio, 1.48 (95% CI, 0.89-2.47); P=0.13. A significant treatment interaction with stroke location (cortical versus noncortical) was noted, P=0.04. In the 87 patients with confirmed cortical involvement, rates of improvement beyond expectations were 50.0% versus 27.0%; odds ratio, 2.70 (95% CI, 1.08-6.73); P=0.03. Similar response patterns were observed for all prespecified secondary efficacy outcomes. No differences in mortality or serious adverse event safety end points were observed. Conclusions- SPG stimulation within 24 hours of onset is safe in acute ischemic stroke. SPG stimulation was not shown to statistically significantly improve 3-month disability above expectations, though favorable outcomes were nominally higher with SPG stimulation. Beneficial effects may distinctively be conferred in patients with confirmed cortical involvement. The results of this study need to be confirmed in a larger pivotal study.

Obesity today is one of the world's greatest health challenges. Little is known about the extent of involvement of the white adipose tissue (WAT) in sepsis and how it is being modified by obesity. We sought to explore the involvement of the WAT in sepsis. We hypothesize that sepsis induces  of the WAT and that obesity alters the response of WAT to sepsis. Six-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomized to a high-fat diet to induce obesity (obese group) or control diet (nonobese group). After 6 to 11 weeks of feeding, polymicrobial sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Mice were sacrificed at 0, 18, and 72 h after CLP and epididymal WAT (eWAT), inguinal WAT, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) harvested. Both types of WAT were processed for light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to assess for morphological changes in both obese and nonobese mice. Tissues were processed for immunohistochemistry, image analyses, and molecular analyses. BATs were used as a positive control. Nonobese mice have an extensive breakdown of the unilocular lipid droplet and smaller adipocytes in WAT compared with obese mice after sepsis. Neutrophil infiltration increases in eWAT in nonobese mice after sepsis but not in obese mice. Nonobese septic mice have an increase in mitochondrial density compared with obese septic mice. Furthermore, nonobese septic mice have an increase in uncoupling protein-1 expression. Although the WAT of nonobese mice have multiple changes characteristic of  during sepsis, these changes are markedly blunted in obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405587>Viability of  on Fresh-Cut Chitosan and Alginate-Coated Apple and Melon Pieces.</a></h1><p>There is an increasing trend toward foods with probiotics; the awareness of healthy diet and wellbeing is the leading cause of this increase.

Apple (Granny Smith) and melon pieces (, var. ) were preliminary treated with an anti- solution (citric and ascorbic acids). Then, fruit pieces were dipped in a solution containing  c19 (9 log cfu/ml) and coated with alginate or chitosan. Samples without probiotic and/or coatings were used as controls. All samples were stored at 4°C for 14 days under air or modified atmosphere (65% N, 30% CO, and % O); the following analyses were done: pH, color, O and CO in the head space, microbiology (mesophilic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, and molds). The most important results can be summarized as follows: (a) Alginate coating showed better performances than chitosan-coating, as it did not affect the viability of . (b) The inoculation of probiotics in the controls negatively affected the color, but the coating was able to counteract this effect. This paper supports the combination of edible coatings and probiotic as a promising way to design new fruit-based functional foods; further investigations are required to study the effect of this combination on the sensory scores.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840863>Extending shelf-life of fresh-cut potato with cactus Opuntia dillenii polysaccharide-based edible coatings.</a></h1><p>Cactus Opuntia dillenii polysaccharide (ODP) exhibits antibacterial and antioxidant activities and can form semipermeable coatings. This study explored on extending the shelf-life of fresh-cut potato with ODP-based edible coatings. Fresh-cut potatoes were treated with ODP solutions of different concentrations (0.%, 1% and 1.%) and stored at  °C for  d. Treatment with ODP-based edible coatings effectively suppressed , microbial growth and respiration rate and inhibited weight loss and total sugar formation during storage at  °C compared with the control (p < 0.05). Based on the efficiency of ODP-based edible coatings, 1% was considered the optimum dose for preservation of fresh-cut potatoes. Results demonstrated that treatment with ODP-based edible coatings may be a practical method for extending the shelf-life of fresh-cut potatoes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

During the brewing process, a large number of nutritional substances and bioactive compounds are produced, which have beneficial effects on human body. In this study, the contents of nutritional compositions including proteins, fats, carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids were determined in SAV samples. The antioxidant compounds and properties of SAV with different aging time were also evaluated. The results showed that the contents of proteins, crude fats, and carbohydrates in SAV were not changed with the aging time. Moreover, Alanine was the main component of amino acids in SAV, and the total contents of amino acids were increased with the aging time. Acetic acid and lactic acid were the predominant organic acids in SAV. The contents of acetic acid and lactic acid accounted for more than 90% of the total organic acids in SAV, which were increased during the aging process of  years. Furthermore, total phenols, flavonoids contents, and  index in SAV were also increased during the aging time. These antioxidant compounds showed a high correlation with the antioxidant activities of SAV measured by ferric reducing antioxidant power and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthi azoline-6-sulfonic acid) assays. The contribution of polyphenolic fractions and high molecular weight melanoidins to total antioxidant activities was similar (about 49% and 48%, respectively). Our findings would provide new insights to further explore the development of new vinegar-based functional foods.The analysis of nutritional compositions, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant capacities in vinegars provides a theoretical basis for the function of SAV. It also provides references for further explore the development of new-type functional and healthy vinegars.© 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042049>Vaccination with FAdV-8a induces protection against inclusion body hepatitis caused by homologous and heterologous strains.</a></h1><p>Fowl aviadenoviruses (FAdV) are important avian pathogens, responsible for several poultry diseases prevalent worldwide, including inclusion body hepatitis (IBH). FAdV intraspecies cross-protection has been clearly demonstrated, but there is little evidence that any interspecies cross-protection exists. The present study aimed to assess the inter- and intraspecies protection between three FAdV field isolates (FAdV-8a, FAdV-8b, FAdV-11) identified in association with severe IBH outbreaks. Inocula prepared using inactivated plaque-purified virus with adjuvant Montanide™ ISA 71VG, were injected intramuscularly into 3-week-old SPF chickens. At 6-weeks of age, the birds were challenged with 10 TCID of homologous or heterologous virus intraperitoneally, and full  examination performed at 4 days post-challenge. Various tissues were examined for gross and histological lesions and assessed for the presence of virus by PCR-HRM. All homologous-type vaccine/challenge groups exhibited protection against IBH lesions with no virus detected in the tissues. Unvaccinated groups challenged with virus showed evidence of FAdV-induced lesions; however, FAdV-8a demonstrated lower pathogenicity compared with FAdV-8b and FAdV-11. In the heterologous-type vaccine/challenge groups, FAdV-8a vaccine was shown to protect against challenge with both FAdV-8b and FAdV-11. FAdV-8a and 8b belong to species E and were therefore anticipated to cross-protect. However, FAdV-11 belongs to species D and therefore cross-protection by FAdV-8a was an uncharacteristic and unique finding of this study. Further research is required to disseminate the molecular basis for the interspecies cross-protection between FAdV-8a and FAdV-11. Nonetheless, the FAdV-8a isolate was shown to have substantial potential as a vaccine candidate in countries where FAdV-8a, 8b or 11 are prevalent.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30350333>Effect of carob variety and roasting on the antioxidant capacity, and the phenolic and furanic contents of carob liquors.</a></h1><p>The production of the traditional carob liquor from Algarve (Portugal) depends on numerous factors such as carob processing, variety and maceration conditions. An experimental design with 36 runs was created to evaluate the effect of the roasting temperature, particle size, variety of carob and time of maceration on several parameters of carob liquors as gallic acid and total phenolic content, the furanic composition (furfural and -(hydroxymethyl)furfural),  index and in vitro antioxidant capacity.The results revealed that carob variety was the independent variable with the greatest effect on antioxidant capacity, total phenolic and gallic acid content. In particular, AIDA liquors presented the highest results, mainly those prepared with unroasted carob. Meanwhile, Galhosa and Mulata liquors showed the greatest concentrations when the carob pulp was roasted at 150 °C. The furanic composition and  index were greatly influenced by the carob roasting degree.The levels of the main toxic furanics present in carob liquors, furfural and -(hydroxymethyl)furfural, suggest a safe consumption of these beverages even in samples of carobs with the maximum roasting degree. The smallest carob particle size favoured the highest phenolic extraction, while the longest maceration periods decreased the concentration of the toxic furanic compounds studied. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31397551>Attentional bias modification is associated with fMRI response toward negative stimuli in individuals with residual depression: a randomized controlled trial</a></h1><p>Attentional bias modification (ABM) may lead to more adaptive emotion perception and emotion regulation. Understanding the neural basis of these effects may lead to greater precision for the development of future treatments. Task-related functional MRI (fMRI) after ABM training has not been investigated in depression so far. The main aim of this randomized controlled trial was to explore differences in brain activity after ABM training, in response to emotional stimuli.A total of 134 people with previous depression, who had been treated for depression and had various degrees of residual symptoms, were randomized to 14 days of active ABM or a closely matched placebo training, followed by an fMRI emotion regulation task. The training procedure was a classical dot–probe task with emotional face stimuli. In the active ABM condition, the probes replaced the more positively valenced face of a given pair. As participants implicitly learned to predict the probe location, this would be likely to induce a more positive attentional bias. The placebo condition was identical, except for the contingency of the probe, which appeared equally behind positive and negative stimuli. We compared depression symptoms and subjective ratings of perceived negativity during fMRI between the training groups. We explored brain activation in predefined regions of interest and across the whole brain. We explored activation in areas associated with changes in attentional bias
and degree of depression.Compared with the placebo group, the ABM group showed reduced activation in the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex when passively viewing negative images. We found no group differences in predefined regions of interest associated with emotion regulation strategies. Response in the temporal cortices was associated with the degree of change in attentional bias and the degree of depressive symptoms in ABM versus placebo.These findings should be replicated in other samples of patients with depression, and in studies using fMRI designs that allow analyses of within-group variability from baseline to follow-up.Attentional bias modification training has an effect on brain function in the circuitry associated with emotional appraisal and the generation of affective states.© 2019 Joule Inc. or its licensors</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627083>Exogenous glycine betaine treatment alleviates low temperature-induced pericarp  of 'Nanguo' pears by regulating antioxidant enzymes and proline metabolism.</a></h1><p>The effect of glycine betaine (GB) on chilling injury (CI)-induced pericarp  in 'Nanguo' pears was investigated during shelf life at 20 °C after storage at 0 °C for 120 d.

Pupil size, globe position, tear production, and intraocular pressure measurements were recorded at , 30, and 45 minutes after induction of anesthesia. For each BTPD, a phenol red thread test was performed in one randomly selected eye and a modified Schirmer tear test I was performed in the other eye. Intraocular pressure was measured by rebound tonometry.Compared with findings for the DKM protocol, pupil size was smaller at all time points when the BTPDs underwent the ISO protocol. Globe position remained central during anesthesia with the DKM protocol, whereas it varied among central, ventromedial, and ventrolateral positions during anesthesia with the ISO protocol. Tear production and intraocular pressure decreased significantly over time when the BTPDs underwent either protocol.Results indicated that ophthalmic examination findings for anesthetized BTPDs can be influenced by the anesthetic protocol used. The DKM protocol may result in more consistent pupil size and globe position, compared with that achieved by use of the ISO protocol. Tear production and intraocular pressure measurements should be conducted promptly after induction of anesthesia to avoid the effect of anesthetic episode duration on these variables.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586899>Characterization, Variables, and Antioxidant Activity of the Maillard Reaction in a Fructose⁻Histidine Model System.</a></h1><p>Fructose and its polysaccharides are widely found in fruits and vegetables, with the Maillard reaction of fructose affecting food quality. This study aimed to investigate the Maillard reaction of fructose using a fructose⁻histidine model system. The reaction process was characterized using fluorescence spectroscopy and ultraviolet spectroscopy. The effects of temperature, initial reactant concentration, initial fructose concentration, initial histidine concentration, and initial pH value on the different stages of the Maillard reaction were studied. Reactant reduction, ultraviolet and fluorescence spectra, acetic acid content, -hydroxymethylfurfural (-HMF) content, and  intensity were evaluated. The results showed that increasing the temperature and reactant concentration promoted the condensation reaction of fructose and amino acid in the early stage, the formation of intermediate products with ultraviolet absorption and fluorescence in the intermediate stage, and the formation of pigment in the final stage. The -HMF concentration decreased with increasing histidine concentration and initial pH value. Changes in the shape of ultraviolet and fluorescence spectra showed that the initial pH value affected not only the reaction rate, but also the intermediate product types. The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging rate of the Maillard reaction products increased with increasing temperature, reactant concentration, and initial pH value.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139384>The effect of desulfurization on the postharvest quality and sulfite metabolism in pulp of sulfitated "Feizixiao" Litchi ( Sonn.) fruits.</a></h1><p>The residual sulfite caused by sulfur fumigation (SF) is a hazard to health and influenced the export trade of litchi. Desulfurization (DS) is a valid chemical method to reduce the residual sulfite. However, the effect of DS on fumigated litchi has not been studied at physiological and molecular level. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of DS (SF plus 3% desulfurizer) on the postharvest quality, sulfite residue, and the sulfite metabolism in sulfitated "Feizixiao" litchi during the 4°C storage. Results indicated that the DS promoted the color recovery of sulfitated litchi and achieved an effect similar to SF on controlling rot and . DS recovered the water content and respiration rate of sulfitated litchi pericarp. Thus, DS improves commodity properties of sulfitated litchi. Moreover, DS greatly reduced sulfite residue especially in pulp and ensured the edible safety of sulfitated litchi. The activities of sulfite oxidase, sulfite reductase, serine acetyltransferase, and -acetylserine(thiol) lyase in pulp increased after SF but fell down after DS while the expressions of their encoding genes decreased after SF but then rallied after DS. These results indicated the key role of these enzymes in sulfite metabolism after SF and DS changed the sulfite metabolism at both enzymatic and transcriptional level. It could be concluded that DS used in this study was an effective method for improving the color recovery and ensuring the edible safety of sulfitated litchi by not only chemical reaction but also both of enzymatic and transcriptional regulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592190>Identifying molecular contributors to autofluorescence of neoplastic and normal colon sections using excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging.</a></h1><p>Autofluorescence, the endogenous fluorescence present in cells and tissues, has historically been considered a nuisance in biomedical imaging. Many endogenous fluorophores, specifically, collagen, elastin, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), are found throughout the human body. In fluorescence imaging scenarios, these signals can be prohibitive as they can outcompete signals introduced for diagnostic purposes. However, autofluorescence also contains information that has diagnostic value. Recent advances in hyperspectral imaging have allowed the acquisition of significantly more data in a shorter time period by scanning the excitation spectra of fluorophores. The reduced acquisition time and increased signal-to-noise ratio allow for separation of significantly more fluorophores than previously possible. We propose to utilize excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging of autofluorescence to differentiate neoplastic lesions from surrounding non-neoplastic "normal" tissue. The spectra of isolated autofluorescent molecules are obtained using a custom inverted microscope (TE-2000, Nikon Instruments) with an Xe arc lamp and thin-film tunable filter array (VersaChrome, Semrock, Inc.). Scans utilize excitation wavelengths from 360 to 550 nm in -nm increments. The resultant molecule-specific spectra are used to analyze hyperspectral image stacks from normal and neoplastic colorectal tissues. Due to a limited number of samples, neoplastic tissues examined here are a pool of both colorectal adenocarcinoma and adenomatous polyps. The hyperspectral images are analyzed with ENVI software and custom MATLAB scripts, including linear spectral unmixing. Initial results indicate the ability to separate signals of endogenous fluorophores and measure the relative concentrations of fluorophores among healthy and diseased states, in this case, normal colon versus neoplastic colon. These results suggest pathology-specific changes to endogenous fluorophores can be detected using excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging. Future work will focus on expanding the library of pure molecules, exploring histogram distance metrics as a means for identifying deviations in spectral signatures, and examining more defined disease states.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443147>Physicochemical Changes of Air-Dried and Salt-Processed  over Storage Time.</a></h1><p>The impact of air-drying at 25 °C, brining at 25%, and dry-salting (at 28% and 40%) on the quality and nutritional parameters of  were evaluated over six months of storage.

Normal liver safely accommodates lipid excess during fasting or carbohydrate restriction by increasing their oxidation to acetyl-CoA and ketones, yet lipid excess during NAFLD leads to hyperglycemia and, in some, steatohepatitis. To examine potential mechanisms, flux through pathways of hepatic oxidative metabolism and gluconeogenesis were studied using five simultaneous stable isotope tracers in ketotic (24-hour fast) individuals with a wide range of hepatic triglyceride contents (0-52%). Ketogenesis was progressively impaired as hepatic steatosis and glycemia worsened. Conversely, the alternative pathway for acetyl-CoA metabolism, oxidation in the tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle, was upregulated in NAFLD as ketone production diminished and positively correlated with rates of gluconeogenesis and plasma glucose concentrations. Increased respiration and energy generation that occurred in liver when β-oxidation and TCA cycle activity were coupled may explain these findings, inasmuch as oxygen consumption was higher during fatty liver and highly correlated with gluconeogenesis. These findings demonstrate that increased glucose production and hyperglycemia in NAFLD is not a consequence of acetyl-CoA production per se, but how acetyl-CoA is further metabolized in liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573385>In vitro and in vivo inhibition of Hass avocado polyphenol oxidase enzymatic  by paeonol, β-cyclodextrin, and paeonol:β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex.</a></h1><p>Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) was extracted from Hass avocados and its physicochemical properties were analyzed. The optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme were pH 7. and 20°C. This PPO showed a high thermal stability, since 26% of the initial activity was retained by the enzyme after heating at 60°C for 40 min. Inhibition studies were performed using different chemical reagents, and the order in the inhibition efficiency was paeonol > 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde > β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). The first two inhibitors presented a non-competitive mechanism while the inhibition by β-CD results from a mixed type mechanism. Since the aqueous solubility of paeonol (a natural compound) is very low, the inclusion complex between this drug and β-CD was obtained in solution and solid state. The stoichiometry of the paeonol:β-CD complex was 1:1 and its ΔG° of formation was -26 kJ/mol. The complexation of paeonol by β-CD not only enhances the aqueous solubility and thermal stability of the drug, but also improves the in vitro inhibition efficiency against PPO. Colorimetric analysis on avocados pulp (in vivo) showed that the inclusion complex does not increase the inhibitory effect of paeonol, remaining practically unchanged. However, the formulation of paeonol:β-CD inclusion complex allows employing this compound as PPO inhibitor in aqueous solutions.Copyright © 2018 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

The PPO activity and treatment variables were fit to first-order kinetics, the Weibull model, and the second-order model. The optimum CP-generation power and treatment time for inactivating PPO in the PPO extract were found to be 900 W and 40 min, respectively, which resulted in the highest inactivation of PPO (49.%).

Microwave CP treatment effectively inactivated PPO in potatoes, demonstrating the potential of CP treatment for controlling PPO activity in foods. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study demonstrated that microwave CP treatment, a nonthermal food processing technology, inactivates PPO activity in potatoes. The results showed that the inactivation effect of CP treatment on PPO corresponded to the surface-to-volume ratio of potato slices.

HPLC analyses revealed the formation of two novel dihydrobenzothiazine carboxylic acid derivatives (8-(3',4'-dihydro-2 H-chromene-3',',7'-triol)-3,4-dihydro--hydroxy-2 H-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid and 7-(3',4'-dihydro-2 H-chromene-3',',7'-triol)-3,4-dihydro--hydroxy-2 H-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid) from 2'-cysteinyl catechin and '-cysteinyl catechin in cysteine incubations, respectively. In contrast, arginine and lysine did not lead to any amino acid adducts. Target compounds were separated by high-performance countercurrent chromatography and preparative HPLC and unequivocally characterized by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mechanistic incubations starting from the catechin-cysteine adducts showed that both catechin and PPO are crucial components in the formation of the dihydrobenzothiazines. The cysteine incubations showed a red-brown coloration, which coincided with formation and degradation of the dihydrobenzothiazines finally leading to the formation of high-polymeric melanins.

This risk is particularly high during ripening due to open-air exposure of the product. Currently, no kill step is applied after manufacture or post ripening to control food safety risks associated with Listeria monocytogenes contamination. Instead, cheesemakers must rely on sanitation and environmental monitoring to reduce this risk. High-pressure processing (HPP) is a nonthermal food-processing technology that can effectively reduce bacterial contaminants with minimal impact on the organoleptic properties of various foods. The objective of this study was to evaluate HPP as a potential intervention to maintain Camembert cheese quality and reduce risk associated with L. monocytogenes. Timing of HPP treatments (3, 11, and 45 d after manufacture) was based on the growth of L. monocytogenes during Camembert cheese ripening. High-pressure processing treatment of fully ripened cheeses (45 d) resulted in destruction of the surface mold, which caused  and yellowing of the cheese rind. Applying HPP treatment earlier in the ripening process (11 d) resulted in a similar degradation of cheese appearance, which did not improve with continued ripening. Applying HPP treatment shortly after production (3 d; before the surface flora developed) delayed the development of the cheese rind and the textural ripening of the cheese. This early treatment time also resulted in free whey being expelled from the cheese, creating a firmer body. Applying HPP 11 d after manufacture resulted in > log reduction of L. monocytogenes at 450 and 550 MPa with holding times of 10 min. Although HPP was effective at reducing L. monocytogenes associated with bloomy rind cheeses, the quality deterioration would be unacceptable to consumers. Cheesemakers must continue to emphasize sanitation and environmental monitoring to reduce the risk of L. monocytogenes in bloomy rind cheeses.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

We collected data on changes in metabolic parameters (glucose, serum lipids, triglycerides; total, low-density, and high-density cholesterol; and total body weight) and soft tissues (abdominal subcutaneous fat [SAT], adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue [VAT], and muscle) from patients  years before the received a diagnosis of PDAC.We collected data from 219 patients with a diagnosis of PDAC (patients) and 657 healthy individuals (controls) from the Rochester Epidemiology Project, from 2000 through 2015. We compared metabolic profiles of patients with those of age- and sex-matched controls, constructing temporal profiles of fasting blood glucose, serum lipids including triglycerides, cholesterol profiles, and body weight and temperature for 60 months before the diagnosis of PDAC (index date). To construct the temporal profile of soft tissue changes, we collected computed tomography scans from 68 patients, comparing baseline (>18 months before diagnosis) areas of SAT, VAT, and muscle at L2/L3 vertebra with those of later scans until time of diagnosis. SAT and VAT, isolated from healthy individuals, were exposed to exosomes isolated from PDAC cell lines and analyzed by RNA sequencing. SAT was collected from KRASG12D P53 mice with PDACs, C57/BL6 (control) mice, and  patients and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry.There were no significant differences in metabolic or soft tissue features of patients vs controls until 30 months before PDAC diagnosis. In the 30 to 18 months before PDAC diagnosis (phase 1, hyperglycemia), a significant proportion of patients developed hyperglycemia, compared with controls, without soft tissue changes. In the 18 to 6 months before PDAC diagnosis (phase 2, pre-cachexia), patients had significant increases in hyperglycemia and decreases in serum lipids, body weight, and SAT, with preserved VAT and muscle. In the 6 to 0 months before PDAC diagnosis (phase 3, cachexia), a significant proportion of patients had hyperglycemia compared with controls, and patients had significant reductions in all serum lipids, SAT, VAT, and muscle. We believe the patients had  of SAT, based on increases in body temperature, starting 18 months before PDAC diagnosis. We observed expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in SAT exposed to PDAC exosomes, SAT from mice with PDACs, and SAT from all  patients but only 1 of 4 controls.We identified 3 phases of metabolic and soft tissue changes that precede a diagnosis of PDAC. Loss of SAT starts 18 months before PDAC identification, and is likely due to . Overexpression of UCP1 in SAT might be a biomarker of early-stage PDAC, but further studies are needed.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The drug was supplied as  mg tablets alongside matching placebo so that participants in both groups received the same number of tablets at any time point in the study. A minimisation algorithm ensured balanced treatment allocation by ethnicity (South Asian, white, or other) and age ( years or less, 6 years or more).The primary outcome measure was time to first relapse over a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Secondary outcome measures were relapse rate, incidence of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome and steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome, use of alternative immunosuppressive treatment, rates of adverse events, behavioural change using the Achenbach child behaviour checklist, quality adjusted life years, and cost effectiveness from a healthcare perspective. Analysis was by intention to treat.No significant difference was found in time to first relapse (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.17, log rank P=0.28) or in the incidence of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (extended course 60/114 (53%)  standard course 55/109 (50%), P=0.75), steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome (48/114 (42%)  48/109 (44%), P=0.77), or requirement for alternative immunosuppressive treatment (62/114 (54%)  61/109 (56%), P=0.81). Total prednisolone dose after completion of the trial drug was 6674 mg for the extended course versus 5475 mg for the standard course (P=0.07). There were no statistically significant differences in serious adverse event rates (extended course 19/114 (17%)  standard course 27/109 (25%), P=0.13) or adverse event rates, with the exception of behaviour, which was poorer in the standard course group. Scores on the Achenbach child behaviour checklist did not, however, differ. Extended course treatment was associated with a mean increase in generic quality of life (0.0162 additional quality adjusted life years, 95% confidence interval -0.005 to 0.037) and cost savings (difference -£1673 ($2160; €1930), 95% confidence interval -£3455 to £109).Clinical outcomes did not improve when the initial course of prednisolone treatment was extended from eight to 16 weeks in UK children with steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome. However, evidence was found of a short term health economic benefit through reduced resource use and increased quality of life.ISRCTN16645249; EudraCT 2010-022489-29.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

However, many open questions remain about appropriate implementation of admixture mapping studies, including how best to control for multiple testing, particularly in the presence of population structure. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework to characterize the correlation of local ancestry and admixture mapping test statistics in admixed populations with contributions from any number of ancestral populations and arbitrary population structure. Based on this framework, we develop an analytical approach for obtaining genome-wide significance thresholds for admixture mapping studies. We validate our approach via analysis of simulated traits with real genotype data for 8,064 unrelated African American and 3,425 Hispanic/Latina women from the Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource (WHI SHARe). In an application to these WHI SHARe data, our approach yields genome-wide significant p value thresholds of 2.1 × 10 and 4. × 10 for admixture mapping studies in the African American and Hispanic/Latina cohorts, respectively. Compared to other commonly used multiple testing correction procedures, our method is fast, easy to implement (using our publicly available R package), and controls the family-wise error rate even in structured populations. Importantly, we note that the appropriate admixture mapping significance threshold depends on the number of ancestral populations, generations since admixture, and population structure of the sample; as a result, significance thresholds are not, in general, transferable across studies.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

Moisture content, water activity and pH values of the product decreased with the increasing roasting time and microwave power, while  index (BI) and ultraviolet absorbance (UV-A) values were increased. While L and b values of carob powders decreased with increasing the roasting time and microwave power, a and ΔE values were increased. Varying roasting conditions also significantly affected the content of Maillard reaction products (MRPs): -hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) (0.69-28.32 mg/kg dry matter), furfural (<LOD-10.44 mg/kg dm), furan (6.65-10.26 mg/kg dm) and acrylamide (78.69-122.87 µg/kg dm). MRPs contents increased with increasing the roasting time and microwave power. The highest MRPs were found in the samples roasted at 140°C for 20 min by hot air.

In this study, for the first time, Zymomonas mobilis levansucrase was used for in situ 6-kestose production in carob molasses. The produced kestose was stable during storage at 20 °C for 4 months. The product was evaluated for color, non-enzymatic  index and titratable acidity during storage and the quality of the product was found comparable to that of control. Furthermore, the decreased amount of sucrose resulted in the prevention of -hydroxymethylfurfural (-HMF) formation during storage. As a result, carob molasses was converted into a high-quality prebiotic product with decreased sucrose content and reduced -HMF quantities, and a new method was developed to prevent -HMF formation in fruit juices and molasses.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In a quest to better understand the non-enzymatic  of shelf-stable orange juice during storage, the juice was fractionated into different fractions depending on the solubility in water/ethanol and the obtained fractions were characterized. The results showed that brown compounds formed during storage of orange juice distributed over water insoluble (pulp), ethanol insoluble (cloud), and ethanol soluble (serum) fractions. In the ethanol insoluble fraction, the brown compounds are hypothesized to be associated to proteins, arabinogalactan proteins and/or protein-pectin complexes of this fraction without significantly changing their molecular weight distribution, monosaccharide composition, and protein content. The changes in the ethanol soluble fraction including ascorbic acid degradation, acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of sucrose, and formation of furfural and -hydroxymethylfurfural were highly correlated to the  development of the juice during storage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31105057>Imaging adipose tissue  using the TSPO-18kDa tracer [F]FEPPA.</a></h1><p>The  of white adipose tissue (WAT) into beige has been proposed as a strategy to enhance energy expenditure to combat the growing epidemic of obesity. Research into  strategies are hampered by the lack of sensitive, translatable, imaging tools capable of detecting beige fat mass non-invasively. [F]FDG is able to detect activated beige fat but provides little information on unstimulated beige fat mass. We have assessed the use of [F]FEPPA, a tracer for the TSPO-18KDa found on the outer mitochondrial membrane, as an alternative imaging agent capable of detecting unstimulated brown fat (BAT) and beige fat.Female Balb/c mice (n = ) were treated for 7 days with the β3 adrenergic agonist CL-316,243 to induce the  of inguinal WAT (beige fat). Animals were imaged longitudinally with [F]FDG and [F]FEPPA and uptake in interscapular BAT and inguinal WAT assessed. The  of inguinal WAT was confirmed using H&E and immunohistochemical detection of UCP-1 and TSPO.Repeated dosing with β3-adrenergic agonist CL-316,243 caused a significant increase in [F]FDG uptake in both interscapular BAT and inguinal WAT associated with the increased metabolic activity of brown and beige adipocytes respectively. [F]FEPPA uptake was likewise increased in inguinal WAT but showed no increase in BAT uptake due to stimulation over the same time course. Furthermore, inguinal WAT uptake was unaffected by pharmacological blockade, indicating that [F]FEPPA uptake is associated with the expression of mitochondria in BAT and beige adipocytes and independent of activation.These data show that [F]FEPPA can detect BAT and newly formed beige fat under non-stimulated, thermoneutral conditions and that uptake after stimulation is linked to mitochondrial expression as opposed to activation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are an important origin of foam cells besides macrophages. Fibronectin type III domain containing protein  (FNDC5) is a protein, which induces  of fat and attenuates glucose/lipid metabolic derangements in obese mice. The present study was designed to determine the roles of FNDC5 in inhibiting foam cell formation and monocyte adhesion in VSMCs and its underlying mechanisms. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) was used to induce foam cell formation and monocyte adhesion in human aortic VSMCs. Foam cell formation was evaluated by intracellular lipid droplets, cholesterol contents, and mRNA levels of acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT-1) and ATP binding cassette transporter A-1 (ABCA-1). Monocyte adhesion was evaluated by the number of monocytes adhered to VSMCs and mRNA levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). FNDC5 inhibited oxLDL-induced foam cell formation, monocyte adhesion, ABCA-1 mRNA downregulation, and ACAT-1, MCP-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA upregulation in VSMCs. It inhibited oxLDL-induced p65-NFκB nuclear translocation, NLRP3 upregulation, caspase-1 and IL-1β production. Inhibition of NFκB with BMS-345541 or inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 showed similar effects to FNDC5 in attenuating the oxLDL-induced foam cell formation, monocyte adhesion, and caspase-1 and IL-1β production. The oxLDL-induced NLRP3 upregulation was prevented by BMS-345541 rather than MCC950. These results indicate that FNDC5 inhibits oxLDL-induced foam cell formation and monocyte adhesion in VSMCs via suppressing NFκB-mediated NLRP3 upregulation and IL-1β production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In wine oxidation, phenolics are oxidized to quinones and these reactive compounds can be quenched by sacrificial nucleophiles, such as the A-ring on flavanoids, preventing oxidative damage from the loss of desirable flavor molecules. The "catechol" B-ring on flavanoids, in contrast, can be oxidized by quinones through electron transfer reactions that lead to flavanoid quinones, precursors of  products. Here we compared the rate of flavanoids reacting by either nucleophilic quinone quenching, or by electron transfer to generate flavanoid quinones. Our approach is based on mathematical modeling of reaction data to derive the rate constants of reactions of A-ring quenching vs B-ring electron transfer with caffeic acid quinone, by fitting the predicted loss of precursors and the appearance of products (or derivatives) with experimental data collected by LC/MS. The rate constant of the electron transfer reaction of caffeic acid quinone towards 4-methyl-catechol was fast (k  = 3.43E-2 mLmolsec) but nucleophilic reactions with afzelechin (k  = 2.53E-3 mLmolsec) or malvidin-3-glucoside (k  = .34E-3 mLmolsec), were much slower. No reaction was detected between caffeic acid quinone and isorhamnetin. Additionally, the electron transfer reaction rate of catechin and caffeic acid quinone was much faster at pH 7 (1.22E-02 mLmolsec) vs pH 3. (1.79E-03 mLmolsec). These results help explain why the reaction of catechin and caffeic acid quinone favors the formation of  products, and more so at higher pH values. Furthermore, bisulfite reacted with quinones faster than the electron transfer reactions, preventing the  observed in the reaction of catechin with caffeic acid quinone in the absence of bisulfite.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the efficiency of juices or extracts obtained from three fruit species with high antioxidant activity as  inhibitors was measured and then compared with that obtained from pomegranate by-product (PBP). The aim was to offer the most significant contributions concerning fresh-cut fruit preservation, using 'Shahmive' pear as the fruit model. Slices of pear were dipped in pomegranate juice (PJ) or extract (PE), kiwifruit juice (KJ) or extract (KE), grape juice (GJ) or extract (GE), PBP and chitosan before being stored at 4 °C.

We investigated factors associated with T2D remission and relapse after RYGB.Retrospective review of consecutive patients with T2D who underwent RYGB between 1993 and 2017. T2D remission was defined as medications discontinuation and/or HbA1c<6.%; relapse was defined as recurrent medication use and/or HbA1c≥6.%. Independent correlates of T2D remission and relapse were identified using logistic regression.621 patients (aged 46.7±10.6 years; 30% on insulin; BMI 49.8±8.3 kg/m) had at least one-year follow-up. Median follow-up was 4.9 (range 1-23.6) years. Prevalence of T2D remission was 74% at one year, 73% from one to three years, 63% between 3 and 10 years, and 47% beyond 10 years. 93% of remissions occurred within 3 years of RYGB, 25% relapsed. The median (IQR) time to relapse was .3 (3-7.8) years after remission. Higher one-year percentage total body weight (%TBW) loss, lack of preoperative insulin use, and younger age at surgery were independently associated with T2D remission. Preoperative insulin use, lower %TBW loss at one year, and greater %TBW gain after one year were independently associated with T2D relapse.This longitudinal retrospective analysis shows that preoperative insulin use and age, one-year weight loss, and regain after that influence T2D remission and relapse following RYGB. Referring patients at a younger age, before insulin is needed, and optimizing both weight loss and weight maintenance after RYGB may improve the rates and durability of T2D remission.Copyright © 2019.

Conventional β-galactosidases, which are used for lactose hydrolysis in lactose-reduced dairy products, will lead to conversion of lactose into glucose and galactose, where especially galactose is very reactive during Maillard reactions. Some β-galactosidases have transgalactosylating activity and will thus convert lactose into galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and hereby limit the release of galactose. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent of participation of GOS in Maillard reactions in comparison to lactose, a 50:50 mixture of glucose and galactose, and galactose exclusively in sodium caseinate-based milk-like model systems heated at 130 and 75 °C at pH 6.8. The GOS system exhibited reduced loss of free amino groups; accumulated less furosine and less of the following advanced glycation end products (AGEs): N-carboxyethyl lysine, methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone isomers, glyoxal-derived lysine dimer, and methylglyoxal-derived lysine dimer; and also developed less  compared to monosaccharide models. However, the GOS-caseinate system accumulated more 3-deoxyglucosone and 3-deoxygalactosone, which resulted in higher concentrations of -(hydroxymethyl)furfural and pyrraline. The results indicated that GOS overall participate less readily in Maillard reactions than the monosaccharides investigated but were more prone to degradation to C6 α-dicarbonyls species. Finally, relationship analysis indicated that C6 α-dicarbonyls seemed to primarily increase concentrations of -(hydroxymethyl)furfural instead of AGEs. Our results suggest that conversion of lactose into GOS instead of monosaccharides in milk by transgalactosylating β-galactosidases could be a useful strategy for production of lactose-free milk for people with lactose intolerance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30275797>Patellofemoral Arthroplasty.</a></h1><p>Patellofemoral arthritis is a common cause of anterior knee pain and limits flexion-related activities of daily living and exercise. While frequently present in bicompartmental and tricompartmental osteoarthritis, patellofemoral arthritis can occur in isolation. Patellofemoral arthroplasty as a treatment option is gaining in popularity, especially with new implant designs. We report a case in which new inlay implants were used to resurface the patellofemoral joint in a patient with contralateral compromise secondary to a previous below-knee amputation.A 37-year-old female with a contralateral right below-knee amputation and progressive left patellofemoral arthritis had failed multiple conservative treatment modalities. She underwent isolated patellofemoral arthroplasty using an inlay-designed implant. The patient was followed for 2 years postoperatively. She noticed an immediate increase in her knee range of motion and her pain scores improved. Two years postoperatively, she demonstrated drastic improvement in all outcome measures: International Knee Documentation Committee score (16.1 to 88.), Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale (22 to 100), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Symptoms (7.14 to 96.43), KOOS Pain (2.78 to 100), KOOS Activities of Daily Living (0 to 100), KOOS Sports (0 to 100), and KOOS Quality of Life (12. to 93.75).Inlay patellofemoral arthroplasty is a valid treatment option for isolated patellofemoral arthritis.

However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia,  is thought to contribute to energy wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and -aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and , as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the  of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular energy sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Sensory loss impacts on older people's ability to participate in their communities and their quality of life. This study investigates the prevalence of vision loss, hearing loss, and dual sensory loss (combined vision and hearing loss) in an older adult Chinese population and describes the relationships between these sensory losses and demographic factors, use of glasses and hearing aids, unmet needs, and impacts on social participation. The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study is a population-based longitudinal survey conducted since 2011. The 2013 dataset for people aged 60 and over was used in this study. Items analyzed included demographic data (age, gender, education, rurality, and SES), self-reported ratings of vision (including legally blind, excellent-poor long, and short distance vision and the use and frequency of wearing glasses), hearing (excellent-poor hearing and the use of hearing aids), dual sensory loss (both poor/fair vision and hearing), and social participation. Of the sample, 80.2% reported poor/fair vision, 64.9% reported poor/fair hearing, and 57.2% had poor/fair vision and hearing. Few respondents (10%) wore glasses regularly and 20.1% wore glasses from time to time. Only 0.8% of respondents wore hearing aids although the proportion with hearing loss was high (64.9%). The proportion of unmet needs for glasses and hearing aids was 54.9 and 63.9%, respectively. Low socio-economic status (SES), poor education, and rurality were significantly associated with the prevalence of poor/fair vision and hearing, the use of glasses and hearing aids and the unmet needs of glasses/hearing aids. Poor/fair vision and/or hearing, and the unmet needs for glasses/hearing aids were significantly and negatively associated with social participation. Sensory loss is a significant health issue for older Chinese people that impacts on their social participation. Training primary care health professionals in identification and rehabilitation approaches is needed as well as increasing the numbers of vision and hearing specialists working in the field.

Heme  concentrations ranged from 0.16 to .1 pmol L (median = 2.0 pmol L,  = 62) in the surface mixed layer (SML) along the cruise track, driven mainly by variability in biomass. However, in the Irminger Basin, the lowest heme  levels (SML: median = 0.53 pmol L,  = 12) were observed, whilst the biomass was highest (particulate organic carbon, median = 14.2 μmol L,  = 25; chlorophyll : median = 2.0 nmol L,  = 23) pointing to regulatory mechanisms of the heme  pool for growth conservation. Dissolved iron (DFe) was not depleted (SML: median = 0.38 nmol L,  = 11) in the Irminger Basin, but large diatoms ( sp.) dominated. Hence, heme  depletion and regulation is likely to occur during bloom progression when phytoplankton class-dependent absolute iron requirements exceed the available ambient concentration of DFe. Furthermore, high heme  concentrations found in the Iceland Basin and Labrador Sea (median = 3.4 pmol L,  = 20), despite having similar DFe concentrations to the Irminger Basin, were attributed to an earlier growth phase of the extant phytoplankton populations. Thus, heme  provides a snapshot of the cellular activity  and could both be used as indicator of iron limitation and contribute to understanding phytoplankton adaptation mechanisms to changing iron supplies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30391175>Influence of cheese-making recipes on the composition and characteristics of Camembert-type cheese.</a></h1><p>Bloomy rind cheeses, including Camembert and related varieties, can be produced using alternative processes that vary based on milk preacidification, cutting, curd handling, and ripening parameters. Modification of these parameters creates distinct cheeses such as lactic curd, stabilized curd, and hybrids of the two. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of  Camembert-type cheese recipes on the composition and characteristics during ripening. Five varieties of Camembert-type cheese were produced: (1) lactic curd, (2) sweet curd, (3) washed curd, (4) solubilized curd, and () stabilized curd. Cheeses were aged at 13°C for 10 d, during the mold growth phase, and 7°C from d 11 until 50. Key quality metrics including texture development, pH (center and surface), and color were monitored throughout shelf-life. Compositional evaluation (d ; fat, protein, moisture, salt, and minerals) grouped cheeses into 3 categories: (1) lactic curd, (2) sweet and washed curd, and (3) solubilized and stabilized curd. The lactic curd and stabilized curd were consistently the most different varieties for composition and quality metrics. Moisture content of Camembert-type varieties ranged from 53.15 to 57.99%, Ca ranged from 0.23 to 0.45%, and P ranged from 0.21 to 0.40%. All varieties followed the expected pH evolution on the rind and in the paste with the pH of the rind reaching 7 by d 10, and paste pH reaching 7 between 35 and 50 d. The displacement of the paste (distance traveled upon cutting) for the lactic curd was the greatest among the  varieties, reaching an average of 27 ± 1.9 mm (mean ± standard error) after 50 d of ripening and 60 min of flow time. The stabilized curd on the other hand traveled the shortest distance, reaching an average of 4 ± 0.4 mm at the same time point. , considered a defect in mold-ripened cheeses, was observed in all varieties, but was most substantial for lactic curd (lightness, L*, decreased from 87.19 to 68.58). Based on these quality metrics the shelf-life of these recipes was estimated with the lactic curd having the shortest, and the stabilized curd having the longest. Examining Camembert-type cheese quality metrics for these  varieties can assist cheesemakers during recipe formulation and selection of cheese-making practices to achieve optimum product quality.The Authors.

Some intervention studies have demonstrated that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) increase systemic concentrations of n-3 PUFA-derived oxylipins and moderately decrease arachidonic acid-derived oxylipins. There is no information on the dose-response of oxylipin concentrations after n-3 PUFA intake.The aim of this study was to quantify oxylipins in human plasma samples from an intervention study in which participants were randomly assigned to different daily intakes of EPA and DHA for 12 mo.Healthy adult men and women with low habitual fish consumption (n = 121) were randomly assigned to receive capsules providing doses of n-3 PUFAs reflecting 3 patterns of consumption of oily fish [1, 2, or 4 portions/wk with 3.27 g EPA + DHA (1:1.2, wt:wt) per portion] or placebo. Oxylipins were quantified in plasma after 3 and 12 mo. Relative and absolute changes of individual oxylipins were calculated and concentrations were correlated with the dose and the content of EPA and DHA in blood lipid pools.Seventy-three oxylipins, mostly hydroxy-, dihydroxy-, and epoxy-PUFAs, were quantified in the plasma samples. After 3 and 12 mo a linear increase with dose was observed for all EPA- and DHA-derived oxylipins. Cytochrome-P450-derived anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective epoxy-PUFAs increased linearly with n-3 PUFA dose and showed low interindividual variance (r2 > 0.95). Similarly, , 12-, and 15-lipoxygenase-derived hydroxy-PUFAs as well as those formed autoxidatively increased linearly. These include the precursors of so-called specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), e.g., 17-hydroxy-DHA and 18-hydroxy-EPA.Plasma concentrations of biologically active oxylipins derived from n-3 PUFAs, including epoxy-PUFAs and SPM-precursors, increase linearly with elevated intake of EPA and DHA. Interindividual differences in resulting plasma concentrations are low.

Here we used the -HT4 receptor partial agonist prucalopride to assess the translatability of these effects and characterise, for the first time, the consequences of -HT4 receptor activation on human cognition and emotion.Forty one healthy volunteers were randomised, double-blind, to a single dose of prucalopride (1 mg) or placebo in a parallel group design. They completed a battery of cognitive tests measuring learning and memory, emotional processing and reward sensitivity.Prucalopride increased recall of words in a verbal learning task, increased the accuracy of recall and recognition of words in an incidental emotional memory task and increased the probability of choosing a symbol associated with a high likelihood of reward or absence of loss in a probabilistic instrumental learning task. Thus acute prucalopride produced pro-cognitive effects in healthy volunteers across three separate tasks.These findings are a translation of the memory enhancing effects of -HT4 receptor agonism seen in animal studies, and lend weight to the idea that the -HT4 receptor could be an innovative target for the treatment of cognitive deficits associated with depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Contrary to the effects reported in animal models, prucalopride did not reveal an antidepressant profile in human measures of emotional processing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553232>GDF5 Promotes White Adipose Tissue Thermogenesis via p38 MAPK Signaling Pathway.</a></h1><p>Growth differentiation factor  (GDF5) was reported to regulate brown adipogenesis; however, its effects on insulin sensitivity, full metabolic syndrome spectrum, and the thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) have not been elucidated yet. We thus generated fatty acid-binding protein 4 (Fabp4)-GDF5 transgenic (TG) mice and showed that GDF5 TG mice developed a relative lean phenotype on a high- diet (HFD) and showed increased insulin sensitivity. Over expression of GDF5 in adipose tissues greatly promoted the thermogenic process in sWAT after cold or β3-agonist treatment. In TG mice, sWAT showed an important thermogenic effect as the thermogenic gene expression was markedly increased, which was consistent with the typical features of beige adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of the protein GDF5 impaired browning program in sWAT after thermogenic stimuli. Enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) signaling was also identified in sWAT of HFD-fed GDF5 mice, and thermogenesis in mature adipocytes induced by GDF5 protein could be partly blocked by a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Taken together, our data suggest that GDF5 could improve insulin sensitivity and prevent metabolic syndrome, the adaptive thermogenesis in sWAT could mediate the obesity resistance effects of GDF5 in mice and partially resulted in the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30527329>Safety and efficacy at 240 weeks of different raltegravir formulations in children with HIV-1: a phase 1/2 open label, non-randomised, multicentre trial.</a></h1><p>Raltegravir is an integrase inhibitor approved for use in adults and children with HIV-1 infection, but there are no data on the long-term use of this medication in children. We aimed to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of multiple raltegravir formulations in children aged 4 weeks to 18 years with HIV-1 infection.In this phase 1/2 open-label multicentre trial (IMPAACT P1066), done in 43 IMPAACT network sites in the USA, South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, and Argentina, eligible participants were children aged 4 weeks to 18 years with HIV-1 infection who had previously received antiretroviral therapy (ART), had HIV-1 RNA higher than 1000 copies per mL, and no exposure to integrase inhibitors. Participants were separated into five age groups and enrolled in six cohorts. Three formulations of open-label raltegravir-adult tablets, chewable tablets, and granules for oral suspension-were added to individualised optimised background therapy, according to the age and weight of participants. The primary outcome at 48 weeks has been previously reported. In the 240-week follow-up, outcomes of interest included graded clinical and laboratory safety of raltegravir formulations during the study and virological efficacy (with virological success defined as HIV-1 RNA reduction of >1 log from baseline or HIV-1 RNA <400 copies per mL) at week 240. The primary analysis group for safety and efficacy comprised patients treated only with the final selected dose of raltegravir. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number .Between August, 2007, and December, 2012, 220 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 153 were enrolled and treated. Of these patients, 122 received only the final selected dose of raltegravir (63 received adult tablets, 33 chewable tablets, and 26 oral granules), and one was not treated. There were few serious clinical or laboratory safety events noted, with two patients having a drug-related adverse event (skin rash), which led one patient to discontinue the study treatment. The addition of raltegravir to an individually optimised ART regimen resulted in virological success at week 240 in 19 (44·2%, 95% CI 29·1-60·1) of 43 patients receiving 400 mg tablets, 24 (77·4%, 58·9-90·4) of 31 patients receiving the chewable tablets, and 13 (86·7%, 59·-98·3) of 15 patients receiving oral granules. Among patients with virological failure, raltegravir resistance was noted in 19 (38%) of 50 patients who had virological rebound after initial suppression and had samples at virological failure available for testing.Our study suggests that raltegravir can be used for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in children as young as 4 weeks, with the expectation of long-term safety and efficacy, but should be used with caution among older children who had previous extensive antiretroviral therapy.National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institute of Mental Health, and Merck.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional Protected Area (PA) effectiveness evaluations have assessed changes in forest extent but have mostly ignored vegetation condition. Tiger Reserves (TRs) are India's PAs with highest protection and management resources. We used a before-after-control-impact-style design with long-term Landsat  TM data to evaluate the effects of protection elevation on vegetation condition (greenness and moisture) in 25 TRs. After declaration as TRs, vegetation condition in 13 TRs (52%) declined in more than 50% of their areas, with 12 TRs (48%) being overall better than their matched Wildlife Sanctuaries (WLSs; PAs with lower protection). In 8 of these TRs analysed for change from before to after declaration, vegetation condition in  TRs was harmed over more than 25% of their areas, with 3 TRs being overall better than their matched WLSs. Our results indicate extensive vegetation  and drying in about half of the study TRs, with these trends often being similar or worse than in matched WLSs. These results suggest that TRs' elevated protection alone may be insufficient to preserve vegetation condition and cast doubt on the effectiveness of protection elevation alone in safeguarding long-term viability of tiger habitats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353525>Heat-induced tolerance to  of fresh-cut lily bulbs (Lilium lancifolium Thunb.) under cold storage.</a></h1><p>Fresh-cut lily bulbs were submerged in hot water at 50°C for 3 min as a condition of heat treatment (HT), and then stored at 4°C for 15 days to investigate the effects of HT on . Results showed that heat-treated samples exhibited lower  degree and had reduced cell death rate and cell membrane permeability when compared to control samples during storage. HT resulted in a significant inhibition in total phenol content and the activities of phenylalanine ammonialyase, polyphenol oxidase, and peroxidase. HT also stimulated the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, however, inhibited lipoxygenase activity and malondialdehyde accumulation. Correlation analysis showed that lipid peroxidation of cell membrane was significantly correlated with  of fresh-cut lily bulbs. The results indicated that HT could serve as an effective approach to retard  of fresh-cut lily bulbs. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The effect of heat treatment (HT) on fresh-cut lily bulbs by treating in hot water (50°C) for 3 min was investigated. It provided experimental basis for further studies of HT in extending the shelf life of fresh-cut lily bulbs. Furthermore, it is a foundation for the application of HT in the processing of fresh-cut lily bulbs.

Camellia seeds are inevitably heated during processing, but the effect of heating or roasting on the physicochemical properties of camellia seed or oil-tea camellia seed oil (camellia oil) has been seldom studied, especially with respect to the Maillard reaction.Changes in reducing sugars, free amino acids, pH, color,  intensity and MRP (furosine, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, -hydroxymethylfurfural and furural) concentrations were examined in camellia seeds during roasting at 120-160 °C for 20-120 min. Results showed that roasting leads first to a decrease and then to a considerable increase in free amino groups and, at the same time, to a reduction in moisture content and decrease in pH. The sucrose content of the seeds decreased, while that of glucose and fructose increased reciprocally during roasting. On the other hand, the observed changes concerning glyoxal were negligible. Furthermore, -hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural have been found at the end of the roasting process, with maximum values of 572.26 ± 1.91 mg kg dry wt and 0.46 ± 0.003 mg kg dry wt, at 160 °C for 120 min, respectively.This investigation provides the initial groundwork necessary for the development and implementation of green and efficient technology that could be applied to obtain high-quality camellia oil.

Among them, bacterial canker of apricot is exceedingly difficult to control due to a lack of efficient prophylactic measures. Several sources of partial resistance have been identified among genetic resources but the underlying genetic pattern has not been elucidated thus far. In this study, we phenotyped bacterial canker susceptibility in an apricot core-collection of 73 accessions over 4 years by measuring canker and superficial  lengths issued from artificial inoculations in the orchard. In order to investigate the genetic architecture of partial resistance, we performed a genome-wide association study using best linear unbiased predictors on genetic (G) and genetic x year (G × Y) interaction effects extracted from linear mixed models. Using a set of 63,236 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers genotyped in the germplasm over the whole genome, multi-locus and multi-variate mixed models aimed at mapping the resistance while controlling for relatedness between individuals.We detected 11 significant associations over 7 candidate loci linked to disease resistance under the two most severe years. Colocalizations between G and G × Y terms indicated a modulation on allelic effect depending on environmental conditions. Among the candidate loci, two loci on chromosomes  and 6 had a high impact on both canker length and superficial , explaining 41 and 26% of the total phenotypic variance, respectively. We found unexpected long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) between these two markers revealing an inter-chromosomal LD block linking the two underlying genes. This result supports the hypothesis of a co-adaptation effect due to selection through population demography. Candidate genes annotations suggest a functional pathway involving abscisic acid, a hormone mainly known for mediating abiotic stress responses but also reported as a potential factor in plant-pathogen interactions.Our study contributed to the first detailed characterization of the genetic determinants of partial resistance to bacterial canker in a Rosaceae species. It provided tools for fruit tree breeding by identifying progenitors with favorable haplotypes and by providing major-effect markers for a marker-assisted selection strategy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31130428>Cerebral microbleeds and stroke risk after ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack: a pooled analysis of individual patient data from cohort studies.</a></h1><p>Cerebral microbleeds are a neuroimaging biomarker of stroke risk. A crucial clinical question is whether cerebral microbleeds indicate patients with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack in whom the rate of future intracranial haemorrhage is likely to exceed that of recurrent ischaemic stroke when treated with antithrombotic drugs. We therefore aimed to establish whether a large burden of cerebral microbleeds or particular anatomical patterns of cerebral microbleeds can identify ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack patients at higher absolute risk of intracranial haemorrhage than ischaemic stroke.We did a pooled analysis of individual patient data from cohort studies in adults with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Cohorts were eligible for inclusion if they prospectively recruited adult participants with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack; included at least 50 participants; collected data on stroke events over at least 3 months follow-up; used an appropriate MRI sequence that is sensitive to magnetic susceptibility; and documented the number and anatomical distribution of cerebral microbleeds reliably using consensus criteria and validated scales. Our prespecified primary outcomes were a composite of any symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage or ischaemic stroke, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, and symptomatic ischaemic stroke. We registered this study with the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews, number CRD42016036602.Between Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 1, 2018, we identified 344 studies. After exclusions for ineligibility or declined requests for inclusion, 20 322 patients from 38 cohorts (over 35 225 patient-years of follow-up; median 1·34 years [IQR 0·19-2·44]) were included in our analyses. The adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] comparing patients with cerebral microbleeds to those without was 1·35 (95% CI 1·20-1·50) for the composite outcome of intracranial haemorrhage and ischaemic stroke; 2·45 (1·82-3·29) for intracranial haemorrhage and 1·23 (1·08-1·40) for ischaemic stroke. The aHR increased with increasing cerebral microbleed burden for intracranial haemorrhage but this effect was less marked for ischaemic stroke (for five or more cerebral microbleeds, aHR 4·55 [95% CI 3·08-6·72] for intracranial haemorrhage vs 1·47 [1·19-1·80] for ischaemic stroke; for ten or more cerebral microbleeds, aHR ·52 [3·36-9·05] vs 1·43 [1·07-1·91]; and for ≥20 cerebral microbleeds, aHR 8·61 [4·69-15·81] vs 1·86 [1·23-1·82]). However, irrespective of cerebral microbleed anatomical distribution or burden, the rate of ischaemic stroke exceeded that of intracranial haemorrhage (for ten or more cerebral microbleeds, 64 ischaemic strokes [95% CI 48-84] per 1000 patient-years vs 27 intracranial haemorrhages [17-41] per 1000 patient-years; and for ≥20 cerebral microbleeds, 73 ischaemic strokes [46-108] per 1000 patient-years vs 39 intracranial haemorrhages [21-67] per 1000 patient-years).In patients with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, cerebral microbleeds are associated with a greater relative hazard (aHR) for subsequent intracranial haemorrhage than for ischaemic stroke, but the absolute risk of ischaemic stroke is higher than that of intracranial haemorrhage, regardless of cerebral microbleed presence, antomical distribution, or burden.British Heart Foundation and UK Stroke Association.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Brown adipose tissue promotes energy expenditure by incorporating the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), also known as thermogenin, which decouples cellular respiration and heat production, in the mitochondrial membranes. Recent data suggest the presence of a thermogenic cell formation from white adipocytes (beige or brite cells) with a potential role in preventing obesity and metabolic syndrome. The formation of these cells is influenced by physical exertion that induces expression of PPARγ coactivator-1 (PGC1) and downstream membrane protein, fibronectin type III domain-containing protein  (FNDC5) in skeletal muscle. Irisin, a thermogenic adipomyokine produced by FNDC5 cleavage is involved in the  of adipose tissue. While animal studies are congruent with regard to the relationship between physical exertion and irisin release, the results from human studies are less than clear. Therefore, this review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of muscle and adipose tissue thermogenesis. Further, it describes the molecular mechanisms by which irisin impacts exercise, glucose homeostasis and obesity. Finally, the review discusses current gaps and controversies related to irisin release, its mode of action and its future potential as a therapeutic tool in managing obesity and metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042041>Targeted Metabolomics Analysis and Identification of Biomarkers for Predicting  of Fresh-Cut Lettuce.</a></h1><p>The metabolism of phenolic compounds is a key factor in the development of wound-induced enzymatic  of fresh-cut lettuce.

In this study, we constructed two vectors, pChG-gTs and pChG-gTa, expressing sense and antisense tyrosinase gene of L. edodes, respectively, using promoters derived from the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. The host strain SR-1 of L. edodes was selected because of its fast growth, high protoplast yield, and high regeneration rate. Upon transformation of the host strain SR-1 with the pChG-gTs vector, a clone with 3.6-fold and 14.-fold higher tyrosinase activity in vegetative mycelia and in fresh gills, respectively, than that of the host strain was obtained from nine transformants. Similarly, two clones containing the pChG-gTa vector with effectively repressed tyrosinase gene expression in vegetative mycelia and gills during the late stage of post-harvest preservation of fruiting bodies were obtained from 10 transformants. However, it remained unclear whether repression of the tyrosinase gene prevented gill , as the host strain also showed less  than a commercial strain.

A proposed mechanism of exposure involves inhibitory learning whereby the association between a stimulus and an aversive outcome is suppressed by a new association with an appetitive or neutral outcome. The blood pressure medication losartan augments fear extinction in rodents and may have similar synergistic effects on human exposure therapy, but the exact cognitive mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown.We used a reinforcement learning paradigm with compound rewards and punishments to test the prediction that losartan augments learning from appetitive relative to aversive outcomes. In a double-blind parallel design, healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to single-dose losartan (50 mg) (n = 28) versus placebo (n = 25). Participants then performed a reinforcement learning task, which simultaneously probes appetitive and aversive learning. Participant choice behavior was analyzed using both a standard reinforcement learning model and analysis of choice switching behavior.Losartan significantly reduced learning rates from aversive events (losses) when participants were first exposed to the novel task environment, while preserving learning from positive outcomes. The same effect was seen in choice switching behavior.This study shows that losartan enhances learning from positive relative to negative events. This effect may represent a computationally defined neurocognitive mechanism by which the drug could enhance the effect of exposure in clinical populations.Copyright © 2019 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

This prevents its application in various food systems and processing technologies. The conjugation of proteins with polysaccharides via the Maillard reaction is an efficient method to improve the functionality of proteins. The purpose of this work was to conjugate gum acacia (GA) with WPI via the dry-heating Maillard reaction and to investigate the effect of reaction time on the physicochemical and functional properties of WPI-GA conjugates.Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high-performance size exclusion chromatography confirmed the formation of higher molecular weight conjugates. The degrees of glycation for WPI-GA conjugates incubated for 1, 3, , and 7 days were 28.14%, 44.98%, 49.50%, and 51.20%, respectively. The glycation reaction reduced the surface hydrophobicity and fluorescence intensity of WPI significantly (P < 0.05). Functional properties of the conjugates, such as solubility, stability against heat-induced insolubility, and emulsion properties were all superior to the control WPI. However, a reaction time longer than a day resulted in a high degree of  and decreased the functionality of the conjugate significantly (P < 0.05).The results indicated that conjugation of WPI with GA can be a promising way to enhance its functional properties.

In addition, calcium plays an important role in maintaining the quality of fruit, and postharvest calcium treatments might determine the potential of fruit for processing. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the postharvest application of calcium and biopreservation with the CPA-7 strain of Pseudomonas graminis on the quality parameters of fresh-cut pears. After harvest, whole pears were dipped in calcium chloride solution (1%, w/v) or water (control) for 10 min at 25 ℃ and stored for five months at temperatures ranging from 0 to -0. ℃. Both batches of fruit were minimally processed and dipped in a solution containing CPA-7 and an antioxidant solution or kept untreated, and both groups were stored at 4 ℃ for six days. The postharvest calcium treatment had no remarkable effect on the quality of the whole and fresh-cut pears. The enzymatic activities (PPO, PME and PG) related to  and softening were constant in fresh-cut pears after storage, and the application of P. graminis CPA-7 had a positive effect on the activity of PPO. Finally, a combined effect of the biocontrol agent and calcium treatment was not demonstrated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717975>The novel adipokine CTRP5 is a negative regulator of white adipose tissue .</a></h1><p>The  of white adipose tissue predominantly emerges as an adaptation to environmental cues, such as cold exposure. The enhanced  of adipose tissue results in improved energy and glucose homeostasis and reduced fat mass and body weight, which is greatly beneficial for the treatment of obesity and other metabolic diseases. C1q/TNF-related protein  (CTRP5) is a novel adipokine associated with a variety of endocrine and metabolic diseases; however, whether it can regulate the metabolism of adipose tissue itself remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of CTRP5 in murine subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) was significantly decreased when the mice were exposed to cold temperatures. The lentivirus-mediated overexpression of CTRP5 in mice repressed the adipose tissue , leading to reduced heat production, decreased expression of the  marker uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and decreased -related gene expression. Mechanistically, we found that autophagy was inhibited after cold exposure, but this inhibition was alleviated after CTRP5 overexpression. In primary cultured adipocytes, CTRP5 suppressed UCP1 expression, whereas 3-MA (an autophagy inhibitor) rescued the suppression. All of these results demonstrated that CTRP5 is a negative regulator of adipose . CTRP5 exerts its effect, at least in part, by suppressing adipocyte autophagy. Our findings indicated that CTRP5 is a novel promising therapeutic target for obesity and other metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, both enhancement of adipocyte energy expenditure and inhibition of adipogenesis are viable ways to combat obesity. Using the Ucp1-2A-luciferase reporter animal model previously reported by us as a screening platform, a chemical compound Linifanib was identified as a potent inducer of UCP1 expression in primary inguinal adipocytes in vitro and in vivo. Signal pathway analyses showed that Linifanib promoted adipocyte  by attenuating STAT3 phosphorylation. The effects of Linifanib on adipocyte  were blocked by the compound, SD19, which activates the STAT3 signaling cascade. Linifanib also inhibited adipocyte differentiation, by blocking mitotic clonal expansion, which could be rescued by STAT3 activator. Taken together, our results indicate that Linifanib might serve as a potential drug for the treatment of obesity.Copyright © 2019.

Moreover, residue generation by rice industries is another challenge. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of microwave irradiation during soaking and gelatinization stages of parboiling rice. Processing time, colorimetric profile, broken and nongelatinized grains, sucrose and glucose content, free -hydroxymethyl-2-furfural, and residual phosphorus were evaluated. As the soaking and gelatinization times during microwave treatments increased, the colorimetric parameters increased; however, the values were lower than those with the conventional process. Regardless of soaking time, a decrease in broken and nongelatinized grains was obtained by using the lowest steaming time ( min). Additionally, lower residual phosphorus content was found in soaking water (10 and 20 min) when using microwave irradiation. Under favorable conditions, a reduction in the levels of broken and nongelatinized grains, residual phosphorus, and color changes was observed, indicating that microwave irradiation may be more beneficial than conventional parboiling. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Parboiling requires a high volume of water and soaking time, which leads to high costs, underutilization of infrastructures, and high residue in the water after processing. The rapid parboiling process involves the use of microwaves during the soaking and gelatinization stages. The main advantages of the microwave parboiling process include reduced processing time, ranging from 83% to 95%, higher gelatinization, greater yield, reduced darkening, and reduced residual phosphorus in the effluents by 60%. This report can aid industries in streamlining their processes, thereby providing a high-quality, lower cost, and environmentally safe product.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30729079>Expression analysis of the polyphenol oxidase gene in response to signaling molecules, herbivory and wounding in antisense transgenic tobacco plants.</a></h1><p>We provide evidence that the expression of the  gene was significantly reduced in response to wounding, MeJ and herbivory in transgenic tobacco under wound-inducible RGLP2 promoter in an anti-sense orientation.Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) genes play an important role in plant defense mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stresses. In the present study, a 655 bp core sequence of the potato  gene was placed under the control of wound-inducible RGLP2 promoter in an anti-sense direction to evaluate its potential effects during biotic ('s infestation) and various abiotic (wounding, MeJ, ABA) stresses. Transcriptional profiling of  gene by real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in transgenic tobacco revealed a significant suppression (3.-fold) of  in response to wounding than control plants after 24 h. In response to MeJ at different concentrations (100 µM and 200 µM), the  expression was greatly down-regulated by 4.7-fold after 6 h at 100 µM MeJ, and a non-significant expression was observed with ABA treatment. Moreover, significant levels of  reduction (sixfolds) was found in whitefly feeding assay indicating that expression of potato  in an anti-sense orientation had down-regulated the  activity. This down-regulation of  by wounding, MeJ and whitefly infestation clearly links the specific expression of  in biotic and abiotic stresses.

(Psa). This bacterium can colonize both male and female  flowers, causing flower  and fall, and systemic invasion of the host plant, eventually leading to its death. However, the process of flower colonization and penetration into the host tissues has not yet been fully elucidated. In addition, the presence of Psa in the pollen from infected flowers, and the role of pollination in the spread of Psa requires confirmation. The present study employed a Psa strain constitutively expressing the fluorescent GFPuv protein, to visualize in vivo flower colonization. Microscopy observations were performed by means of confocal laser scanning and wide-field fluorescent microscopy, and were coupled with the study of Psa population dynamics by quantitative PCR (q-PCR). The pathogen was shown to colonize stigmata, move along the stylar furrow, and penetrate the receptacles via the style or nectarhodes. Once the receptacle was invaded, the pathogen migrated along the flower pedicel and became systemic. Psa was also able to colonize the anthers epiphytically and endophytically. Infected male flowers produced contaminated pollen, which could transmit Psa to healthy plants. Finally, pollinators ( and ) were studied in natural conditions, showing that, although they can be contaminated with Psa, the pathogen's transmission via pollinators is contrasted by its short survival in the hive.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31274920>Effect of steam parboiling and hot soaking treatments on milling yield, physical, physicochemical, bioactive and digestibility properties of buckwheat ( L.).</a></h1><p>Post-harvest hydrothermal processing of grains are targeted at improving milling performances and nutritional properties. In this study, the effects of two hydrothermal processes, namely steam parboiling and soaking in boiling water for different durations on properties of buckwheat ( L.) grown in the Indian Himalayan regions were assessed. Both treatments significantly improved milling yield. Changes in grain section morphology were evidenced under scanning electron microscope. Milder processing for  and 10 min mostly exerted annealing effect, represented by increased intensities of X-ray diffraction peaks. Starch gelatinization occurred upon prolonged processing for 15 and 20 min. This resulted in decreased crystallinity, increased sedimentation volume, paste thinning during rapid viscosity analysis and lower thermal transition in differential scanning calorimetry. Marginal changes in oil uptake suggested limited protein denaturation. Natural antioxidant compounds were variably denatured. Maillard  was indicated by CIE L* a* b* colour and antioxidant levels. The starchy flour samples showed partial resistance to enzymatic amylolysis post retrogradation. Soaking in boiling water can be considered as a feasible alternative to conventional steam parboiling for better milling yield of buckwheat. Altered physicochemical and nutritional properties of buckwheat suggested that the hydrothermally modified flours can be used in ready to eat therapeutic food products.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421776>Ultrasound treatment combined with fumaric acid for inactivating food-borne pathogens in apple juice and its mechanisms.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the synergistic bactericidal efficacy of combining ultrasound (US) and fumaric acid (FA) treatment against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes in apple juice and to identify the synergistic bactericidal mechanisms. Additionally, the effect of combination treatment on juice quality was determined by measuring the changes in color, pH, non-enzymatic  index, and total phenolic content. A mixed cocktail of the three pathogens was inoculated into apple juice, followed by treatment with US (40 kHz) alone, FA (0.05, 0.1, and 0.15%) alone, and a combination of US and FA for 1, 2, 3, 4, and  min. Combined US and 0.15% FA treatment for  min achieved .67, 6.35, and 3.47 log reductions in E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes, respectively, with the 1.55, 2.37, and 0.57 log CFU reductions attributed to the synergistic effect. Although the pH value slightly decreased as FA increased, there were no significant (P > 0.05) differences in color values,  indices, and phenolic content between untreated and treated samples. To identify the mechanism of this synergistic bactericidal action, membrane integrity, malfunctions in the membrane efflux pump, and intracellular enzyme activity were measured. The analyses confirmed that damage to the cell envelope (membrane integrity and efflux pump) was strongly related to the synergistic microbial inactivation. These results suggest that simultaneous application of US treatment and FA is a novel method for ensuring the microbial safety of apple juice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The implications of this rapid change for lake ecosystem function remain poorly understood. To assess how freshwater communities respond to such profound changes in their habitat and resource availability, we conducted a space-for-time analysis of food-web structure in 30 lakes situated across a temperature-productivity gradient equivalent to the predicted future climate of subarctic Europe (temperature +3°C, precipitation +30% and nutrient +45 μg L total phosphorus). Along this gradient, we observed an increase in the assimilation of pelagic-derived carbon from 25 to 75% throughout primary, secondary and tertiary consumers. This shift was overwhelmingly driven by the consumption of pelagic detritus by benthic primary consumers and was not accompanied by increased pelagic foraging by higher trophic level consumers. Our data also revealed a convergence of the carbon isotope ratios of pelagic and benthic food web endmembers in the warmest, most productive lakes indicating that the incorporation of terrestrial derived carbon into aquatic food webs increases as land use intensifies. These results, reflecting changes along a gradient characteristic of the predicted future environment throughout the subarctic, indicate that climate and land use driven eutrophication and  are radically altering the function and fuelling of aquatic food webs in this biome.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31318582>A Two-Interval, Forced-Choice, Observer-Based Procedure for Evaluating Hearing Sensitivity in Children With Motor and Developmental Impairments.</a></h1><p>Purpose It can be challenging to collect reliable behavioral responses to sound from individuals with significant motor or developmental impairments, the most common types of comorbid disability found in children with hearing loss (e.g., Gallaudet Research Institute, 2011). The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of using a 2-interval, forced-choice, observer-based method for individuals considered to be difficult-to-test using behavioral audiometric assessments. Method Participants were  children with motor and developmental impairments, ages -15 years ( = 11.6,  = 4.6). The functional abilities of all participants were greater than 2  below the mean, as measured by the Vineland-II Parent Caregiver Rating Form. Participants listened to either a male talker saying the word "playground" or a 1000-Hz warble tone, presented via an insert earphone or a sound field speaker. An observer, blind to signal presentation, selected 1 of 2 temporal intervals, determining which contained the signal based only on participant behavior. Criterion was reached when the observer correctly identified the interval containing the signal for 8 of the last 10 trials. Results An 80%-correct criterion was met for all participants, suggesting feasibility for use in children with motor or developmental impairment. Two participants were tested using an adaptive tracking procedure; a reliable threshold estimate was obtained for both children.

Mothers and infants were followed through week 48 after delivery. The primary outcome was a composite of treatment-related maternal adverse events of grade 3 or higher or permanent discontinuation of the trial regimen because of toxic effects. The noninferiority margin was an upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference in the rate of the primary outcome of less than  events per 100 person-years.A total of 956 women were enrolled. A primary outcome event occurred in 72 of 477 women (15.1%) in the immediate group and in 73 of 479 (15.2%) in the deferred group (incidence rate, 15.03 and 14.93 events per 100 person-years, respectively; rate difference, 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.77 to 4.98, which met the criterion for noninferiority). Two women in the immediate group and 4 women in the deferred group died (incidence rate, 0.40 and 0.78 per 100 person-years, respectively; rate difference, -0.39; 95% CI, -1.33 to 0.56); all deaths occurred during the postpartum period, and 4 were from liver failure (2 of the women who died from liver failure had received isoniazid [1 in each group]).

Here, we examined the physiological and metabolic effects of the deficiency of these two bile acid receptors on hepatic metabolism and injury in mice. Fxr/Tgr5 double knockout mice (DKO) were generated for metabolic phenotyping. Male DKO mice fed a chow diet had reduced liver lipid levels but increased serum cholesterol levels. Liver cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) activity and sterol 12α-hydroxylase mRNA levels were induced, while ileum FXR target genes were suppressed in DKO mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Bile acid pool size was increased in DKO mice, with increased taurocholic acid and decreased tauromuricholic acids. RNA sequencing analysis of the liver transcriptome revealed that bile acid synthesis and fibrosis gene expression levels are increased in chow-fed DKO mice compared to WT mice and that the top regulated pathways are involved in steroid/cholesterol biosynthesis, liver cirrhosis, and connective tissue disease. Cholestyramine treatment further induced Cyp7a1 mRNA and protein in DKO mice and increased bile acid pool size, while cholic acid also induced Cyp7a1 in DKO mice, suggesting impaired bile acid feedback regulation. A Western diet containing 0.2% cholesterol increased oxidative stress and markers of liver fibrosis but not hepatic steatosis in DKO mice. Conclusion: FXR and TGR5 play critical roles in protecting the liver from inflammation and fibrosis, and deficiency of both of these bile acid receptors in mice increased cholic acid synthesis and the bile acid pool, liver fibrosis, and inflammation; FXR and TGR5 DKO mice may be a model for liver fibrosis.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955796>Characterisation of the course of Mycoplasma bovis infection in naturally infected dairy herds.</a></h1><p>Mycoplasma bovis causes bovine respiratory disease, mastitis, arthritis and otitis. The importance of M. bovis has escalated because of recent outbreaks and introductions into countries previously free of M. bovis. We characterized the course of M. bovis infection on 19 recently infected dairy farms over 24 months. Our objective was to identify diagnostic tools to assess the efficacy of control measures to assess low risk infection status on M. bovis infected farms. PCR assays and culture were used to detect M. bovis, and in-house and BioX ELISAs were used to follow antibody responses. Cows and young stock were sampled on four separate occasions, and clinical cases were sampled when they arose. On 17 farms, a few cases of clinical mastitis were detected, mostly within the first eight weeks after the index case. Antibodies detected by in-house ELISA persisted in the serum of cows at least for 1. years on all farms, regardless of the M. bovis infection status or signs of clinical disease or subclinical mastitis on the farm. Six out of 19 farms became low risk as the infection was resolved. Our results suggest that, for biosecurity purposes, regular monitoring should be conducted on herds by screening for M. bovis in samples from cows with clinical mastitis and calves with pneumonia, in conjunction with testing young stock by screening longitudinally collected nasal swabs for M. bovis and sequential serum samples for antibody against recombinant antigen.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It was reported that exercise promotes the shedding of the extracellular domain of Fndc5, generating a circulating peptide (irisin) that cross-talks to adipose tissues to convert lipid-storing white adipocytes to energy-catabolizing beige adipocytes. However, the requirement of Fndc5 in mediating the beneficial effect of exercise remains to be determined. Here, we created a mouse model of Fndc5 mutation through transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated DNA targeting. The Fndc5 mutant mice have normal skeletal muscle development, growth, regeneration, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism at resting state, even when fed a high-fat diet. In response to running exercise, however, the Fndc5 mutant mice exhibit reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and have lower maximal oxygen consumption compared with the exercised wild-type mice. Mechanistically, Fndc5 mutation attenuates exercise-induced  of white adipose tissue that is crucial for the metabolic benefits of physical activities.

This trial compared the efficacy and safety of phenytoin and levetiracetam for second-line management of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus.This open-label, randomised clinical trial was undertaken at 30 UK emergency departments at secondary and tertiary care centres. Participants aged 6 months to under 18 years, with convulsive status epilepticus requiring second-line treatment, were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation schedule to receive levetiracetam (40 mg/kg over  min) or phenytoin (20 mg/kg over at least 20 min), stratified by centre. The primary outcome was time from randomisation to cessation of convulsive status epilepticus, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (excluding those who did not require second-line treatment after randomisation and those who did not provide consent). This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN22567894.Between July 17, 2015, and April 7, 2018, 1432 patients were assessed for eligibility. After exclusion of ineligible patients, 404 patients were randomly assigned. After exclusion of those who did not require second-line treatment and those who did not consent, 286 randomised participants were treated and had available data: 152 allocated to levetiracetam, and 134 to phenytoin. Convulsive status epilepticus was terminated in 106 (70%) children in the levetiracetam group and in 86 (64%) in the phenytoin group. Median time from randomisation to cessation of convulsive status epilepticus was 35 min (IQR 20 to not assessable) in the levetiracetam group and 45 min (24 to not assessable) in the phenytoin group (hazard ratio 1·20, 95% CI 0·91-1·60; p=0·20). One participant who received levetiracetam followed by phenytoin died as a result of catastrophic cerebral oedema unrelated to either treatment. One participant who received phenytoin had serious adverse reactions related to study treatment (hypotension considered to be immediately life-threatening [a serious adverse reaction] and increased focal seizures and decreased consciousness considered to be medically significant [a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction]).Although levetiracetam was not significantly superior to phenytoin, the results, together with previously reported safety profiles and comparative ease of administration of levetiracetam, suggest it could be an appropriate alternative to phenytoin as the first-choice, second-line anticonvulsant in the treatment of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus.National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Genome sequences of 95 APEC from commercial poultry operations in four Australian states that carried the class 1 integrase gene intI1, a proxy for multiple drug resistance (MDR), were characterized. Sequence types ST117 (22/95), ST350 (10/95), ST429 and ST57 (each 9/95), ST95 (8/95) and ST973 (7/95) dominated, while 24 STs were represented by one or two strains. FII and FIB repA genes were the predominant (each 93/95, 98 %) plasmid incompatibility groups identified, but those of B/O/K/Z (25/95, 26 %) and I1 (24/95, 25 %) were also identified frequently. Virulence-associated genes (VAGs) carried by ColV and ColBM virulence plasmids, including those encoding protectins [iss (91/95, 96 %), ompT (91/95, 96 %) and traT (90/95, 95 %)], iron-acquisition systems [sitA (88/95, 93 %), etsA (87/95, 92 %), iroN (84/95, 89 %) and iucD/iutA (84/95, 89 %)] and the putative avian haemolysin hylF (91/95, 96 %), featured prominently. Notably, mobile resistance genes conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones, colistin, extended-spectrum β-lactams and carbapenems were not detected in the genomes of these 95 APEC but carriage of the sulphonamide resistance gene, sul1 (59/95, 63 %), the trimethoprim resistance gene cassettes dfrA5 (48/95, 50 %) and dfrA1 (25/95, 27 %), the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(A) (51/95, 55 %) and the ampicillin resistance genes blaTEM-1A/B/C (48/95, 52 %) was common. IS26 (77/95, 81 %), an insertion element known to capture and mobilize a wide spectrum of antimicrobial resistance genes, was also frequently identified. These studies provide a baseline snapshot of drug-resistant APEC in Australia and their role in the carriage of ColV-like virulence plasmids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30696272>The effect of high-power ultrasound on the quality of carrot juice.</a></h1><p>The effect of high-power ultrasound treatment on enzymes' activity, physicochemical attributes (total soluble solids, pH, viscosity, turbidity, particle size distribution and colour) and carotenoids' content of carrot juice was investigated. The treatments were carried out at 20 kHz (0.95, 2.38, 3.80 W/ml power) in an ice bath for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 min. The polyphenol oxidase and pectin methylesterase activity were decreased by 43.90 and 37.95% at 3.80 W/ml power and 10 min exposure time, respectively. With the increase of power and time, the effect of high-power ultrasound on the inactivation of enzymes was getting stronger. However, high-power ultrasound had no inactivation effect on peroxidase activity under all treatment conditions. The visual colour differences were not obvious after high-power ultrasound. The pH, total soluble solids and particle size distribution of carrot juice were not significantly affected ( > 0.05) under all treatment conditions, while turbidity was increased and carotenoids' content was decreased. The viscosity of carrot juice was decreased by 1.27% at 0.95 W/ml power and 8 min, while it was increased by 2.29% at 2.38 W/ml power and 8 min. The value of viscosity was negatively correlated with the activity of pectin methylesterase (Pearson's r = -0.481,  < 0.05). According to these results, we could conclude that the optimal treatment condition was 3.80 W/ml for 10 min. Overall, high-power ultrasound treatment inhibited , maintained taste and nutritional value and improved stability of carrot juice. Therefore, this technology could well be an option for processing of carrot juice and laid the theoretical foundation for the production of carrot juice and carrot compound beverage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670192>The effect of amino acids on non-enzymatic  of glucosamine: Generation of butterscotch aromatic and bioactive health compounds without detectable levels of neo-formed alkylimidazoles.</a></h1><p>A mixture of glucosamine (GlcN, 15% w/v) and different amino acids in 1:1 M ratio was incubated at 70 °C for 12 h. The resulting GlcN-amino acid caramels were analysed for α-dicarbonyl compounds, polyhydroxyalkyl pyrazines, heterocyclic compound and alkylimidazoles. All the analyses were performed by using HPLC-MS/MS followed by pooling the variables with principal component analysis (PCA). GlcN-Gly caramels generated the greatest amount of butterscotch aromatic compound diacetyl and polyhydroxyalkyl pyrazines (fructosazine and deoxyfructosazine). The potentially toxic heterocyclic compound, -hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was generated in greater amounts with the GlcN-Arg caramels. However, the toxic alkylimidazoles (4-MEI and THI) were not present in any of the GlcN-amino acid caramels. The results suggest that caramel with butterscotch aroma and bioactivity can be produced with GlcN-amino acid at 70 °C. The PCA performed discriminated the majority of the GlcN-amino acid combinations; GlcN-Gly and GlcN-Ser were best discriminated.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Averrhoa bilimbi, locally called belimbing buluh (DBB), is mainly used as an ethnomedicine in the treatment of metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity. The present study aims to investigate the  activity on white adipocytes by A. bilimbi leaf extract and to evaluate the potential mechanisms.Ethanolic leaf extract of A. bilimbi was exposed to Myf5 lineage precursor cells to stimulate adipocyte differentiation. Protein expressions of brown adipocyte markers were determined through high content screening analysis and validated through western blotting. Mito Stress Test assay was conducted to evaluate the cellular oxygen consumption rate upon A. bilimbi treatment.A. bilimbi ethanolic leaf extract exhibited an adipogenesis effect similar to a PPARgamma agonist. It also demonstrated brown adipocyte differentiation in myoblastic Myf5-positive precursor cells. Expression of UCP1 and PRDM16 were induced. The basal metabolic rate and respiratory capacity of mitochondria were increased upon A. bilimbi treatment.The findings suggest that Averrhoa bilimbi ethanolic leaf extract induces adipocyte  through PRDM16 activation and enhances mitochondria activity due to UCP1 up-regulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161561>High dose of linagliptin induces thermogenic beige adipocytes in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue in diet-induced obese C57BL/6 mice.</a></h1><p>To verify whether the treatment with linagliptin induces the  of the subcutaneous WAT (sWAT) and thermogenesis in murine diet-induced obesity (DIO) model.Forty animals were randomly assigned to receive a control diet (C, 10% lipids as energy) or a high-fat diet (HF, 50% lipids as energy) for 10 weeks. Each group was re-divided to begin the -week treatment, totalizing four experimental groups: C, C-L (C plus linagliptin, 30 mg/kg body mass; BM), HF, and HF-L (HF plus linagliptin, 30 mg/kg BM). The drug was mixed with diet.HF animals showed overweight, glucose intolerance, and a greater cross-sectional area of adipocytes. The treatment with linagliptin was able to normalize the BM, restore the glucose tolerance and the cross-sectional area of adipocytes. These observations comply with the observation of UCP1-positive multilocular adipocytes in the sWAT of treated animals. Both treated groups (C-L and HF-L) showed high expression of thermogenic and type 2 cytokines genes, which agree with the enhanced body temperature and the lower respiratory exchange ratio, implying enhanced thermogenesis with the use of lipids as fuel.The reduced BM, the enhanced body temperature, and the presence of positive UCP1 beige cells in the sWAT point to the activation of the  cascade on the sWAT of linagliptin-treated mice, and hence, linagliptin could induce the thermogenic pathway as a pleiotropic effect that can have translational potential.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353553>Postharvest application of antibrowning chemicals modulates oxidative stress and delays pericarp  of controlled atmosphere stored litchi fruit.</a></h1><p>Litchi fruit were treated with methionine [(0.25%) MN] and cysteine [(025%) CN] alone or in combination, and kept under 1% O + % CO controlled atmosphere (CA) at  ± 1ºC for 28 days. Among different treatments, CN was most effective to inhibit , than MN and CN + MN under CA conditions. Application of 0.25% CN significantly delayed  index, reduced disease incidence, weight loss, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, electrolyte leakage, hydrogen peroxide (H O ), superoxide anion (O  ) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities with higher contents of total anthocyanins under CA-storage. In addition, 0.25% CN treatment showed higher contents of ascorbic acid, total phenolics (TPC), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl-radical scavenging capacity and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and catalase (CAT) enzymes having maintained quality attributes. Therefore, 0.25% CN pre-treatment could be considered a promising way for managing , and conserving litchi fruit quality under CA-storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Litchi fruit are highly perishable due to rapid pericarp  having limited postharvest market potential. The  takes place due to enzymatic reactions and phenolic oxidation. However, it can be delayed by exogenous antibrowning treatments and suitable storage environment. The delayed incidence of pericarp  may help to maintain its quality with extended storage potential suitable for domestic and international markets. So, the outcomes of the current work may help to maintain overall quality and to extend its storage potential that would be helpful in extending its market life with maintained visual quality at domestic and international destinations.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30468689>Evidence of high  F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of the dorsocervical area in young adults.</a></h1><p>What is the central question of this study? In some studies, biopsies have been performed of the subcutaneous adipose tissue in the abdomen, and they failed to find  markers. Is the abdomen the right place to take biopsies? What is the main finding and its importance? For first time, we observed that the glucose uptake in the dorsocervical subcutaneous adipose tissue is higher in comparison to other areas of subcutaneous adipose tissue.Neonates have subcutaneous brown adipose tissue (BAT) in the dorsocervical area, and it is thought that these depots gradually disappear with age. Here, we determined that young adults have high  F-flurodeoxyglucose ( F-FDG) uptake in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of the dorsocervical area. A total of 133 young adults (age 22 ± 2 years; body mass index 25 ±  kg m ) were included in the study. We performed a shivering threshold test for every participant. Later, we performed 2 h of personalized cold exposure, immediately before a positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan. We showed that 23 of 133 participants had  F-FDG uptake in the dorsocervical area that achieved the criteria to be considered BAT, mainly in women (96%, n = 22 of 23). In the whole sample, the glucose uptake in the SAT of the dorsocervical area was positively correlated with BAT volume and activity located in the supraclavicular area. We showed that the  F-FDG uptake of the SAT of the dorsocervical area in humans is different from that of other SAT areas. Future studies are warranted to confirm the brown signature of this tissue.© 2018 The Authors.

The adipokine lipocalin 2 (LCN2) has been implicated in inflammation and obesity. Herein, we investigated the protective effects of caloric restriction (CR) on LCN2-mediated inflammation and oxidative stress in the BAT of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Mice were fed a HFD for 20 weeks and then either continued on the HFD or subjected to CR for the next 12 weeks. CR led to the  of the white fat-like phenotype in HFD-fed mice. Increased expressions of LCN2 and its receptor in the BAT of HFD-fed mice were significantly attenuated by CR. Additionally, HFD+CR-fed mice had fewer neutrophils and macrophages expressing LCN2 and iron-positive cells than HFD-fed mice. Further, oxidative stress and mitochondrial fission induced by a HFD were also significantly attenuated by CR. Our findings indicate that the protective effects of CR on inflammation and oxidative stress in the BAT of obese mice may be associated with regulation of LCN2.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30322530>Population wide assessment of antimicrobial use in dogs and cats using a novel data source - A cohort study using pet insurance data.</a></h1><p>Antimicrobial use in veterinary practice is under increasing scrutiny as a contributor to the rising risk of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. Surveillance of antimicrobial use in food animals is extensive globally, but population level data is lacking for companion animals. Lack of census data means cohorts are usually restricted to those attending veterinary practices, which precludes aggregating data from large cohorts of animals, independent of their need for veterinary intervention. The objective of this study was to investigate the exposure of dogs and cats to antimicrobials at a population level. A retrospective cohort study was performed using a novel data source; a pet insurance database. The rate of antimicrobial prescribing, and the rate of prescribing of critically important antimicrobials, was measured in a large population of dogs (813,172 dog-years) and cats (129,232 cat-years) from 2013 - 2017. The incidence rate of antimicrobial prescribing was .8 prescriptions per 10 dog years (95% CI .8-.9 per 10 dog years) and 3.1 prescriptions per 10 cat years (95% CI 3.1-3.2 per 10 cat years). Critically important antimicrobials accounted for 8% of all the antimicrobials prescribed over the 4-year study. Cats were 4.8-fold more likely than dogs to be prescribed 3rd-generation cephalosporins. The level of antimicrobial exposure in dogs and cats was less than half that for the coincident human community. Data such as this provides a unique opportunity to monitor antimicrobial prescribing in veterinary medicine, which is a critical component of optimal antimicrobial stewardship.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Vegetation has unavoidably affected the temperature by altering surface properties, while the magnitude of this effect has remained unknown. This study aimed to investigate the patterns of global Ts-Ta and quantify the contribution of vegetation change. Trend analysis, correlation analysis and a trajectory-based method were adopted for the investigation. The results demonstrated that the global Ts-Ta decreased by -0.140 K from 2001 to 2016. The greening trend covered 24.46% of the land and played a profound role in changing Ts-Ta. In particular, vegetation changes resulted in -0.0022 K, -0.0092 K and - 0.0043 K of the Ts-Ta decreases at the global, greening and  levels, respectively accounting for 11.58%, 35.38% and 20.38% of the total decrease. Physically, vegetation influenced Ts-Ta mainly by altering atmospheric properties, rather than surface properties. Specifically, the greening of the surface reduced the albedo at a rate of -0.0003/year over 20% of the global land and enhanced atmospheric water vapor by 3 × 10 g/m over approximately 40% of the land. Meanwhile, the effect of vegetation change varied with coverage. A reduction in albedo caused by vegetation change occurred equally over different vegetated conditions, while the enhancement of atmospheric water vapor occurred mainly in sparsely (0.10 < NDVI < 0.30) and densely (0.55 < NDVI < 0.70) vegetated regions. Under these conditions, the vegetation change mainly affected Ts-Ta in sparsely vegetated regions (NDVI < 0.4). The results of this study are helpful for understanding the physical mechanism behind changes in global Ts-Ta and support climatic adaptation and environmental management.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Dysfunction of these cells may lead to the pathogenesis of human diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, identification and elucidation of key molecular mechanisms that regulate the development and function of these exocrine cells would be crucial for understanding of disease pathogenesis and discovery of new therapeutic targets. The Ufm1 conjugation system is a novel ubiquitin-like modification system that consists of Ufm1 (Ubiquitin modifier 1), Uba5 (Ufm1-activating enzyme, E1), Ufc1 (Ufm1-conjugating enzyme, E2) and poorly characterized Ufm1 E3 ligase(s). Recent mouse genetic studies have demonstrated its indispensable role in embryonic development and hematopoiesis. Yet its role in other tissues and organs remains poorly defined. In this study, we found that both Ufl1 and Ufbp1, two key components of the Ufm1 E3 ligase, were highly expressed in the intestinal exocrine cells. Ablation of either Ufl1 and Ufbp1 led to significant loss of both Paneth and goblet cells, which in turn resulted in dysbiotic microbiota and increased susceptibility to experimentally induced colitis. At the cellular and molecular levels,  deficiency caused elevation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and cell death program. Administration of small molecular chaperone partially prevented loss of Paneth cells caused by acute Ufbp1 deletion. Taken together, our results have provided unambiguous evidence for the crucial role of the Ufm1 E3 ligase in maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and protection from inflammatory diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30403821>Admixture mapping identifies novel loci for obstructive sleep apnea in Hispanic/Latino Americans.</a></h1><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Its prevalence and severity vary across ancestral background. Although OSA traits are heritable, few genetic associations have been identified. To identify genetic regions associated with OSA and improve statistical power, we applied admixture mapping on three primary OSA traits [the apnea hypopnea index (AHI), overnight average oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) and percentage time SaO2 < 90%] and a secondary trait (respiratory event duration) in a Hispanic/Latino American population study of 11 575 individuals with significant variation in ancestral background. Linear mixed models were performed using previously inferred African, European and Amerindian local genetic ancestry markers. Global African ancestry was associated with a lower AHI, higher SaO2 and shorter event duration. Admixture mapping analysis of the primary OSA traits identified local African ancestry at the chromosomal region 2q37 as genome-wide significantly associated with AHI (P < .7 × 10-), and European and Amerindian ancestries at 18q21 suggestively associated with both AHI and percentage time SaO2 < 90% (P < 10-3). Follow-up joint ancestry-SNP association analyses identified novel variants in ferrochelatase (FECH), significantly associated with AHI and percentage time SaO2 < 90% after adjusting for multiple tests (P < 8 × 10-6). These signals contributed to the admixture mapping associations and were replicated in independent cohorts. In this first admixture mapping study of OSA, novel associations with variants in the iron/heme metabolism pathway suggest a role for iron in influencing respiratory traits underlying OSA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30369849>Seed-born  Infects Rice Seedling and Maintains Bacterial Population during Vegetative and Reproductive Growth Stage.</a></h1><p>Rice world production is affected due to the growing impact of diseases such as bacterial panicle blight, produced by .

It is currently recognized the entrance of this pathogen to the plant, from infected seeds and from environmental sources of the microorganism. However, it is still not fully elucidated the dynamics and permanence of the pathogen in the plant, from its entry until the development of disease symptoms in seedlings or panicles. In this work it was evaluated the infection of  rice plants, starting from inoculated seeds and substrates, and its subsequent monitoring after infection. Various organs of the plant during the vegetative stage and until the beginning of the reproductive stage, were evaluated. In both inoculation models, the bacteria was maintained in the plant as an endophyte between 1 × 10 and 1 × 10 cfu of .g of plant throughout the vegetative stage. An increase of bacterial population towards initiation of the panicle was observed, and in the maturity of the grain, an endophyte population was identified in the flag leaf at 1 × 10 cfu of .g fresh weight of rice plant, conducting towards the symptoms of bacterial panicle blight. The results found, suggest that  in rice plants developed from infected seeds or from the substrate, can colonize seedlings, establishing and maintaining a bacterial population over time, using rice plants as habitat to survive endophyticly until formation of bacterial panicle blight symptoms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480627>Lyophilized Maqui () Berry Induces  in the Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue and Ameliorates the Insulin Resistance in High Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h1><p>Maqui () berry features a unique profile of anthocyanidins that includes high amounts of delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside--O-glucoside and delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside and has shown positive effects on fasting glucose and insulin levels in humans and murine models of type 2 diabetes and obesity. The molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of maqui on the onset and development of the obese phenotype and insulin resistance was investigated in high fat diet-induced obese mice supplemented with a lyophilized maqui berry. Maqui-dietary supplemented animals showed better insulin response and decreased weight gain but also a differential expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, multilocular lipid droplet formation and thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). These changes correlated with an increased expression of the carbohydrate response element binding protein b (), the sterol regulatory binding protein 1c () and Cellular repressor of adenovirus early region 1A-stimulated genes 1 () and an improvement in the fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) signaling. Our evidence suggests that maqui dietary supplementation activates the induction of fuel storage and thermogenesis characteristic of a brown-like phenotype in scWAT and counteracts the unhealthy metabolic impact of an HFD. This induction constitutes a putative strategy to prevent/treat diet-induced obesity and its associated comorbidities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30386318> Chi-Induced Change in ROS Metabolism and Its Relation to Pericarp  and Disease Development of Harvested Longan Fruit.</a></h1><p> Chi is a major pathogenic fungus that infects harvested longan fruit. This study aimed to investigate the effects of  on reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism and its relation to the pericarp  and disease development of harvested longan fruit during storage at 28°C and 90% relative humidity. Results showed that compared to the control longans, -inoculated longans displayed higher indexes of pericarp  and fruit disease, higher O  generation rate, higher accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA), lower contents of glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic acid (AsA), lower 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging ability and reducing power in pericarp. In addition, -infected longans exhibited higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in the first 2 days of storage, and lower activities of SOD, CAT, and APX during storage day 2- than those in the control longans. These findings indicated that pericarp  and disease development of -infected longan fruit might be the result of the reducing ROS scavenging ability and the increasing O  generation rate, which might lead to the peroxidation of membrane lipid, the loss of compartmentalization in longan pericarp cells, and subsequently cause polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) to contact with phenolic substrates which result in enzymatic  of longan pericarp, as well as cause the decrease of disease resistance to  and stimulate disease development of harvested longan fruit.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30458978>Development and validation of a robust multiplex serological assay to quantify antibodies specific to pertussis antigens.</a></h1><p>Despite wide spread vaccination, the public health burden of pertussis remains substantial. Current acellular pertussis vaccines comprise upto five Bordetella pertussis (Bp) antigens. Performing an ELISA to quantify antibody for each antigen is laborious and challenging to apply to pediatric samples where serum volume may be limited. We developed a microsphere based multiplex antibody capture assay (MMACA) to quantify antibodies to five pertussis antigens; pertussis toxin, pertactin, filamentous hemagglutinin and fimbrial antigens 2/3, and adenylate cyclase toxin in a single reaction (-plex) with a calibrated reference standard, QC reagents and SAS based data analysis program. The goodness of fit (R) of the standard curves for five analytes was ≥0.99, LLOQ 0.04-0.15 IU or AU/mL, accuracy 1.9%-23.8% (%E), dilutional linearity slopes 0.93-1.02 and regression coefficients r = 0.91-0.99. MMACA had acceptable precision within a median CV of 16.0%-22.8%. Critical reagents, antigen conjugated microsphere and reporter antibody exhibited acceptable (<12.3%) lot-lot variation. MMACA can be completed in <3 h, requires low serum volume (μL/multiplex assay) and has fast data turnaround time (<1 min).

Prescribed medication lists were ascertained from case notes and electronic medical records. Anti-Cholinergic Burden (ACB) was calculated from medication lists. Patients were categorised into three groups based on ACB; none (ACB score of 0); moderate (up to ACB score of two); high (ACB score more than two). The effect of increasing ACB on selected outcomes of 30- and 90-day mortality, hospital readmission within 30-days of discharge and increased length of hospital stay were examined using multivariable logistic regression models.The 452 patients had a mean age (SD) of 51.7 (±20.6) years, 273 (60.4%) patients had no ACB burden, 106 (23.%) had a ACB burden of up to two; and 73 (16.2%) had an ACB burden of > 2. Multivariable analyses showed no association between high ACB burden and 90-day (fully adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.56 (95%CI 0.12-2.85); P = 0.48) and 30-day mortality (fully adjusted OR = 0.75 (95%CI 0.05-11.04); P = 0.84).

For 12 weeks, C57BL/6 mice were fed a controlled high-fat diet (HFD) or HFDs with 0.2% or 0.% w/w PFE. In vitro, the differentiation of 3 T3-L1 cells was used to elicit thermogenesis in the presence of PFE. PFE obviously reduced body weight and fat mass in a dose-dependent manner, increased energy expenditure, improved insulin sensitivity, and prevented hepatic steatosis by increasing lipid oxidation and secretion in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, PFE induced clear  in sWAT, significantly increased phosphorylation of AMPKα1/2 and p38, increased BAT activity and the differentiation of 3 T3-L1 by increasing the expression of uncoupling protein 1 and other thermogenic genes.

Compared with untreated samples, dry-heated samples showed significantly higher 2,2-Diphenyl-1-Picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability with whey protein to inulin mass ratios of 1:2 and 1:3 and significantly higher 2,2'-Azinobis(2-Ethylbenzothiazoline-6-Sulfonate) (ABTS) scavenging abilities and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) at all weight ratios. Dry heat-induced interactions between whey protein and inulin was confirmed by changes in Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) protein profile, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Far-ultraviolet Circular Dichroism (Far-UV CD) spectra. Dry heating caused physicochemical and structural changes of whey protein and therefore the complexes can be used to improve the antioxidative properties of the mixture under certain conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579236>Early childhood family instability and immune system dysregulation in adolescence.</a></h1><p>Exposure to stress is one way in which social disadvantages during childhood may alter biological and psychological systems with long-term consequences. Family social and economic conditions are critical for early childhood development and exposure to difficult family conditions may have lasting physiological effects. However, there is little research linking early childhood conditions with physiological indicators of stress and system dysregulation in adolescence. In this study, we assess how family social and economic instability that occurred in early childhood (birth to age ) is associated with immune system dysregulation in adolescence, as indicated by DNA shedding of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We utilize a biomarker of EBV obtained through saliva, a non-invasive method of collecting immune-system biomarkers, in 674 adolescents 11-17 years old. Multivariable regression results indicated that experiences of moving into a new parent/caregiver household or moving in with a grandparent during early childhood was associated with an estimated 100% increase in EBV DNA shedding among prior EBV-infected adolescents. Other measures of early childhood family instability, total number of family structure changes and economic insecurity, were marginally significant. Contemporaneous family conditions were not associated with adolescents' EBV DNA shedding.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, we and others found that  of white adipose tissue (WAT) is a critical component of this complex detrimental response. Although  and inflammation have been independently delineated to occur after injury, their interaction is currently not well defined. One of the master regulators of inflammation and adipose tissue remodeling after burns is nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The aim of this this study was to determine whether NLRP3 modulates and activates WAT  after burn. To obtain molecular and mechanistic insights, we used an NLRP3 knockout (NLRP3) murine burn model. We demonstrated that genetic deletion of NLRP3 promoted persistent and augmented  in adipocytes, evidenced by increased gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and  at 3 days (.74 vs. 0.29,  < 0.05; 26.0 vs. 0.71,  < 0.05) and uncoupling protein 1 () and  at 7 days (7,406 vs. 3,894,  < 0.05; 20.6 vs. 2.52,  < 0.01) and enhanced UCP1 staining and multilocularity. Additionally, the main regulator of postburn WAT , IL-6, was elevated in the plasma acutely after burn in NLRP3 compared with wild-type counterparts (478.9 vs. 67.1 pg/mL,  < 0.05 at 3 days). These results suggest that NLRP3 has antibrowning effects and that blocking NLRP3 increases thermogenesis and augments  via increased levels of IL-6. Our findings provide insights into targeting innate inflammatory systems for regulation of adaptive thermogenesis, a critical response after burns and other hypermetabolic conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387271>Relationship of the Phytochemicals from Coffee and Cocoa By-Products with their Potential to Modulate Biomarkers of Metabolic Syndrome In Vitro.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to compare the phytochemicals from coffee and cocoa by-products and their relationship with the potential for reducing markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, adipogenesis, and insulin resistance in vitro. We characterized the phytochemical profile of extracts from coffee husk, coffee silverskin, and cocoa shell and evaluated their in vitro biological activity in RAW264.7 macrophages and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Pearson correlations and principal component regressions were performed to find the contribution of phytochemicals and underlying mechanisms of action. Coffee husk and silverskin extracts were mainly composed of caffeine and chlorogenic acid. Major components in cocoa shell included theobromine and protocatechuic acid. Both coffee and cocoa by-product extracts effectively reduced inflammatory markers in macrophages and adipocytes (NO, PGE, TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-6) and the production of reactive oxygen species (21.-66.4%). Protocatechuic and chlorogenic acids, together with caffeine, were suggested as main contributors against inflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, extracts reduced lipid accumulation (4.1-49.1%) in adipocytes by regulating lipolysis and inducing adipocyte . Gallic and chlorogenic acids were associated with reduced adipogenesis, and caffeine with adipocyte . Extracts from coffee and cocoa by-products also modulated the phosphorylation of insulin receptor signaling pathway and stimulated GLUT-4 translocation (52.4-72.9%), increasing glucose uptake. The insulin-sensitizing potential of the extracts was mainly associated with protocatechuic acid. For the first time, we identified the phytochemicals from coffee and cocoa by-products and offered new insights into their associations with biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, adipogenesis, and insulin resistance in vitro.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608562>The Janus Face of Cereals: Wheat-Derived Prebiotics Counteract the Detrimental Effect of Gluten on Metabolic Homeostasis in Mice Fed a High Fat/High Sucrose Diet.</a></h1><p>Cereals are important sources of carbohydrates, but also contain nutrients that could impact adiposity. We analyzed the contribution of gluten on obesity and the effects of prebiotics -arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (AXOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)- that can be extracted from gluten-containing cereals.Mice were fed a control diet, Western diet (WD, consisting of high fat/high sucrose), or WD with % gluten. Prebiotics were tested in the WD with gluten. Gluten did not increase body weight or intestinal permeability and had a minor effect on ileal inflammation. Gluten decreased the expression of  markers in the fat, and increased the triglycerides synthesis in the muscle. AXOS decreased body weight and adiposity in fat pads muscle and liver compared to the WD plus gluten. AXOS promoted gluten cleavage by the induction of prolyl endopeptidase that was translated into a reduction of gluten immunogenic peptides. Gluten had minor effects on cecal microbiota composition, whereas prebiotics increased Bifidobacterium, Butyricicoccus, Prevotella and Parasutterella, all negatively correlated to the cecal content of gluten peptides.While gluten may affect metabolic homeostasis, these effects are lessened when gluten is consumed along with cereal-derived fibers. If confirmed in humans, we bring new arguments to eat fiber-rich cereals to promote a healthy diet. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.This article is protected by copyright.

The selected proteases were able to inactivate PPO at pH 4., with the degree of inactivation proportional to incubation time and protease concentration. Papain was the most effective protease, with 50 μg completely inactivating PPO in less than one hour. AA prevented  reactions that occur before or during PPO inactivation by protease. The combinations of AA/proteases were highly effective  where 2 mM AA/500 μg proteases inhibited PPO activity completely over 24 h. The combination of AA/proteases was also effective , as treated apricot purees preserved their color ( < 0.0001, compared to untreated samples after 10 days of storage). The results demonstrate that AA/proteases combinations constitute a promising practical anti- method with feasible application in the food industry.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30645429>Tapless and topology agnostic calibration solution for silicon photonic switches.</a></h1><p>We leverage the photo-conductance (PC) effect in doped phase-shifter heaters for both controlling and calibrating Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) switch elements. Both the steady-state and the transient response are experimentally characterized, and compact models for the PC current are developed. Utilizing the PC effect, a topology-agnostic algorithm is then outlined. The calibration procedure is experimentally verified against calibration with external photo-detectors using a non-blocking 4×4 Benes switch consisting of six 2×2 MZIs. It is shown that our PC-based approach agrees with the PD-based procedure within less than 2.% of difference between the obtained calibrated values. Based on the calibrated PC values, all possible routing configurations are measured for extinction ratio (9.92-21.51dB), insertion loss (0.88-4.59dB), and exhibiting performances far below the 7% FEC limit (bit error rate of 3.8 × 10 ) using 25 Gbps 4-level pulse-amplitude-modulation signals (PAM4).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31318182>Macrophages protect against loss of adipose tissue during cancer cachexia.</a></h1><p>Cancer cachexia represents a central obstacle in medical oncology as it is associated with poor therapy response and reduced overall survival. Systemic inflammation is considered to be a key driver of cancer cachexia; however, clinical studies with anti-inflammatory drugs failed to show distinct cachexia-inhibiting effects. To address this contradiction, we investigated the functional importance of innate immune cells for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated cachexia.A transgenic HCC mouse model was intercrossed with mice harbouring a defect in myeloid cell-mediated inflammation. Body composition of mice was analysed via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and microcomputed tomography. Quantitative PCR was used to determine adipose tissue  and polarization of adipose tissue macrophages. The activation state of distinct areas of the hypothalamus was analysed via immunofluorescence. Multispectral immunofluorescence imaging and immunoblot were applied to characterize sympathetic neurons and macrophages in visceral adipose tissue. Quantification of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse serum was performed with a multiplex immunoassay. Visceral adipose tissue of HCC patients was quantified via the L3 index of computed tomography scans obtained during routine clinical care.We identified robust cachexia in the HCC mouse model as evidenced by a marked loss of visceral fat and lean mass. Computed tomography-based analyses demonstrated that a subgroup of human HCC patients displays reduced visceral fat mass, complementing the murine data. While the myeloid cell-mediated inflammation defect resulted in reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum of HCC-bearing mice, this unexpectedly did not translate into diminished but rather enhanced cachexia-associated fat loss. Defective myeloid cell-mediated inflammation was associated with decreased macrophage abundance in visceral adipose tissue, suggesting a role for local macrophages in the regulation of cancer-induced fat loss.Myeloid cell-mediated inflammation displays a rather unexpected beneficial function in a murine HCC model. These results demonstrate that immune cells are capable of protecting the host against cancer-induced tissue wasting, adding a further layer of complexity to the pathogenesis of cachexia and providing a potential explanation for the contradictory results of clinical studies with anti-inflammatory drugs.© 2019 The Authors Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society on Sarcopenia, Cachexia and Wasting Disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400965>The 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology Hydroxychloroquine Dosing Guidelines For Short, Obese Patients.</a></h1><p>The increasing prevalence of obesity over the past 60 years implies the need to reassess the risk of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (HR) in obese women using the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 2016 guidelines.Cross-sectional study.Medical records of 64 patients with HR from the practices of 2 ophthalmologists, 11 of whom were women with body mass index of 30 kg/m or more, were reviewed.Daily dosing based on real and ideal weight was calculated.Determine the number (and percentage) of patients given daily dosing according to real-weight and ideal-weight guidelines.In 4 patients (36%), daily dosing was more than  mg/kg based on real weight and more than 6. mg/kg based on ideal weight. In 4 patients (36%), daily dosing was  mg/kg or less based on real weight and 6. mg/kg or less based on ideal weight. In 3 patients (27%), daily dosing was  mg/kg or less based on real weight and more than 6. mg/kg based on ideal weight. No patient had daily dosing of more than  mg/kg based on real weight and 6. mg/kg or less based on ideal weight.Twenty-seven percent of cases of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in obese women had ostensibly safe dosing based on 2016 AAO guidelines. Overdosing of obese women by 2016 AAO guidelines is not rare.

Severe phytotoxic symptoms in leaves and roots including leaf chlorosis and root  were noticed when grown at ≥ 50 µM Cd. All genotypes showed high tolerance to low Cd levels ( µM and 25 µM Cd), in contrast to high Cd levels (i.e. 50 µM and 100 µM) that severely disturbed plant growth of all genotypes. Cadmium concentrations reached 165.0-1251.0 µg g DW in leaves, 22.9-331.2 µg g in stems among the genotypes at -25 µM Cd, and Cd mainly accumulated in the roots. Although willow tissues can accumulate relatively high Cd concentrations under high Cd levels (≥ 50 µM), they are not suitable for phytoextraction of Cd due to poor growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299516>Effect of sodium hydrosulphite treatment on the quality of non-centrifugal sugar: Jaggery.</a></h1><p>Jaggery is a non-centrifugal sweetener produced by thermo-chemical treatments of sugarcane juice. The traditional practices involved in making jaggery are usually tailored using chemicals to meet consumer requirements. Sodium hydrosulphite (hydros) is a commonly employed chemical in the jaggery industry to improve its colour. This article presents a comparative study of jaggery made with and without hydros treatments. The differences in properties, such as sorption behaviour, colour, polyphenols, flavonoids, minerals, and sulphur dioxide content, were measured. Hydros-treated jaggery was found to be brighter in colour with a lower  index by -10. SO content of hydros-treated jaggery was >70 ppm, while minerals, polyphenols, and flavonoids were less abundant compared to control jaggery, thereby compromising overall quality. Based on the experiments carried out, the optimum treatment of hydros can be employed to satisfy consumer demand while producing an acceptable quality of jaggery that conforms to norms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
