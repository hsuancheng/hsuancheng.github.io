Whether similar CRT is also effective for conditioning of persons with chronic tetraplegia is unknown. In addition, protein supplementation () before and immediately postexercise has been shown to enhance exercise adaptations.This study aimed to investigate whether a modified 40-45 min CRT program will improve fitness attributes in individuals with tetraplegia and whether these changes are enhanced by .Eleven individuals with chronic tetraplegia underwent 6 months of CRT performed three times per week. Six randomly assigned participants received  (whey protein = 36-37 g) in split doses immediately before and after exercise sessions. Others consumed a matched protein dose 24 h postexercise. Measurements of one-repetition maximum (1-RM) strength for six different resistance exercises, arm peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), and arm anaerobic power (Wingate) were obtained 3 months before (-3mo), at the beginning (0mo), 3 months into (3mo), and 6 months after (6mo) the beginning of CRT.One-repetition maximum increased by 8%-11% ± 6%-12% for each successive 3-month period (P ≤ .001-.012), independent of  group (P = .105). VO2peak increased significantly from 0mo to 6mo with immediate  (35% ± 29%, P = .020) but failed to reach significance for delayed  (% ± 8%, P = .147). Power drop changes during the Wingate test were also only significant for the immediate  (median difference 40W, P = .028) and not for delayed (10W, P = .500).CRT effectively increased muscular strength, aerobic capacity, and anaerobic fatigue resistance in persons with chronic tetraplegia. The latter two conditioning benefits were further enhanced by timely .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25136842>Advanced disease at enrollment in HIV care in four sub-Saharan African countries: change from 2006 to 2011 and multilevel predictors in 2011.</a></h2><p>To examine changes between 2006 and 2011 in the proportion of HIV-positive patients newly enrolled in HIV care with advanced disease and the median CD4 cell count at enrollment; and identify patient, facility, and contextual-level factors associated with late enrollment in care in 2011.Cross-sectional over time.For time-trends analyses, routinely collected patient-level data (307 110 adults newly enrolled in 138 HIV clinical care facilities) in Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda and Tanzania; and for analyses of correlates, patient-level data (46 201 in 195 facilities), and facility and population-level survey data were used. Late enrollment was defined as CD4 cell count 350 cells/μl or less and/or WHO clinical stage 3/4.Late enrollment declined from 69.9 to 57.2% (P < .0001); median CD4 cell count increased from 242 to 292 cells/μl (Ptrend < .0001). In 2011, risk of late enrollment was significantly higher for men and nonpregnant women vs. pregnant women; patients aged above 25 vs. -25 years; nonmarried vs. married; and those entering from sites other than prevention of mother-to-child transmission. More extensive HIV testing coverage in the region of a facility was significantly associated with lower risk of late enrollment.Despite improvement, in 2011, 57% of patients entered HIV care who were already antiretroviral therapy-eligible. The lower risk of late enrollment among those referred from prevention of mother-to-child transmission and in regions where HIV testing coverage was higher suggests that innovative approaches to rapidly increase testing uptake among people living with HIV prior to the development of symptoms have the potential to reduce late enrollment in care.2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins</p></html>
