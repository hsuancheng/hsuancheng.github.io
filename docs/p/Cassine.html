Such mediators contribute to oxidative stress and alter inflammatory processes in adipose tissue, leading to insulin resistance during obesity. Thus, the identification of natural compounds such as plant polyphenols able to increase the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity of the body is of high interest. We aimed to evaluate the biological properties of polyphenol-rich extracts from the medicinal plants A. borbonica, D. apetalum and G. mauritiana on preadipocytes exposed to H2O2, TNFα or LPS mediators.Medicinal plant extracts were analysed for their polyphenol contents by Folin-Ciocalteu and UPLC-ESI-MS methods as well as for their free radical-scavenging activities by DPPH and ORAC assays. To assess the ability of polyphenol-rich extracts to protect 3T3-L1 preadipocytes against H2O2, TNFα or LPS mediators, several parameters including cell viability (MTT and LDH assays), ROS production (DCFH-DA test), IL-6 and MCP-1 secretion (ELISA) were evaluated. Moreover, the expression of superoxide dismutase, catalase and NF-κB genes was explored (RT-QPCR).All medicinal plants exhibited high levels of polyphenols with free radical-scavenging capacities. Flavonoids such as quercetin, kaempferol, epicatechin and procyanidins, and phenolic acids derived from caffeic acid including chlorogenic acid, were detected. Polyphenol-rich plant extracts did not exert a cytotoxic effect on preadipocytes but protected them against H2O2 anti-proliferative action. Importantly, they down-regulated ROS production and the secretion of IL-6 and MCP-1 pro-inflammatory markers induced by H2O2, TNFα and LPS mediators. Such a protective action was associated with an increase in superoxide dismutase antioxidant enzyme gene expression and a decrease in mRNA levels of NF-κB pro-inflammatory transcription factor.This study highlights that antioxidant strategies based on polyphenols derived from medicinal plants tested could contribute to regulate adipose tissue redox status and immune process, and thus participate to the improvement of obesity-related oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14170145>THE VASCULAR RESISTANCE OF THE FOETAL AND NEWLY VENTILATED LUNG OF THE LAMB.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26990279>A pilot randomized controlled trial of telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy for preoperative bariatric surgery patients.</a></h2><p>Psychosocial interventions can improve eating behaviours and psychosocial functioning in bariatric surgery candidates. However, those that involve face-to-face sessions are problematic for individuals with severe  due to mobility issues and practical barriers.To examine the efficacy of a pre-operative telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy (Tele-CBT) intervention versus standard pre-operative care for improving eating psychopathology and psychosocial functioning.Preoperative bariatric surgery patients (N = 47) were randomly assigned to receive standard preoperative care (n = 24) or 6 sessions of Tele-CBT (n = 23).Retention was 74.5% at post-intervention.

Because this constellation of abnormalities is reminiscent of the pleiotropic in vitro activities of IL-4 and IL-5, we examined the possibility that malignant T cells in SzS may be producing increased amounts of IL-4 with a concomitant decrease in IL-2 and IFN-gamma production. Such a cytokine secretion pattern would be similar to that produced by murine Th2 cells. Serum IL-4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements revealed that 33% of SzS patients (n = 21) had levels of IL-4 significantly higher (mean, 7.2 pg/ml; range, 0-48, p less than 0.05) than normal controls (mean, 1.59; range, 0-3.1). Although the majority of tested patients had elevated serum IgE, no direct correlation between serum IL-4 levels and serum IgE levels was observed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from SzS patients and stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) produced significantly higher levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and significantly lower levels of IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma than did PBMC from normal controls (p less than 0.02, p less than 0.05, and p less than 0.02, respectively). PBMC from SzS patients in remission produced IL-4 and IL-2 levels similar to that of the normal controls. To determine if IFN-gamma could inhibit the increased IL-4 production by PHA-stimulated PBMC from SzS patients, IFN-gamma was added to culture at 0, 24, or 48 h prior to the addition of PHA. Significant decreases in IL-4 production were seen only in cultures incubated with IFN-gamma for 24 and 48 h prior to the addition of PHA. IL-2 levels were not affected by IFN-gamma incubation. The increased IL-4 and decreased IL-2 and IFN-gamma production by PBMC from SzS patients suggests that Sezary cells have a cytokine profile similar to murine Th2 cells. Moreover, this cytokine secretion pattern may play an integral role in the immunopathogenesis of advanced CTCL. The results also suggest that IFN-gamma be a useful component in the spectrum of therapeutic approaches to SzS.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292909>Eltrombopag in Immune Thrombocytopenia, Aplastic Anemia, and Myelodysplastic Syndrome: From Megakaryopoiesis to Immunomodulation.</a></h2><p>Eltrombopag is an orally available thrombopoietin receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Beyond the effect on megakaryopoiesis, the drug also showed a stimulating effect on the hematopoietic stem cell with consistent clinical efficacy in aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Eltrombopag is highly effective in ITP and less so in AA and MDS. This observation underlines the importance of residual normal hematopoiesis, which is maximal in ITP, minimal/absent in AA, and dysregulated in MDS. In ITP, the drug at 50-75 mg daily induced up to 85% responses both in clinical trials and real-life studies, with the possibility of tapering and discontinuation. In AA, eltrombopag at 150 mg daily was effective in about 40% of cases relapsed/refractory to standard immunosuppression or ineligible for bone marrow transplant. In MDS, the drug seems less effective, with responses in about a quarter of patients at various schedules. The efficacy of eltrombopag in ITP, AA, and MDS suggests the existence of common immune-pathological mechanisms in these diseases, including autoimmunity against peripheral blood cells and bone marrow precursors, as well as a possible evolution of one condition into the other. Additional mechanisms of action emerging from the clinical use of eltrombopag include modulation of T-regulatory cells, restoration of Fc-γ receptor balance in phagocytes, and an iron-mobilizing effect. In this review, we analyzed the most recent literature on eltrombopag use and efficacy in patients with ITP, AA, and MDS, exploring the basis for different dosing, combined treatments, and discontinuation in each context.</p><p>Keyword:['immunotherapy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26895728>Toronto Bariatric Interprofessional Psychosocial Assessment Suitability Scale: Evaluating A New Clinical Assessment Tool for Bariatric Surgery Candidates.</a></h2><p>Patients who are referred for possible bariatric surgery (BS) intervention undergo a series of assessments conducted by an interdisciplinary health care team to determine suitability for surgery. Herein, we report the initial validation and reliability studies of the Bariatric Interprofessional Psychosocial Assessment Suitability Scale (BIPASS) and its relationship to interdisciplinary psychosocial assessment practices for BS.This study was conducted at the Toronto Western Hospital, a Level 1A BS center of excellence accredited by the American College of Surgeons. Phase I: a total of 4 blinded raters applied the BIPASS to 31 randomly selected BS cases referred to our program to establish interrater reliability. Phase II: in all, 3 raters with clinical experience in bariatric psychosocial care applied the BIPASS to 54 randomly selected BS cases.In total, 46 of 54 (85.1%) patients were women. The median age of all patient cases was 49 years (range: 21-74). Raters׳ BIPASS scores ranged from 4-52 (median = 19.24, standard deviation =10.38). BIPASS scores were highly predictive of the BS psychosocial outcome (area under curve = 0.915; 95% CI: 0.844-0.985; p < 0.001). A BIPASS score of ≥16 was chosen as the cutoff score for further clinical assessment before proceeding with surgical evaluation based on a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (sensitivity = 0.839; specificity = 0.783). The instrument has very good interrater reliability (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.847) even among novice raters.The findings show that the BIPASS is a comprehensive screening tool in the psychosocial assessment of BS candidates, which standardizes the evaluation process and systematically identify at-risk patients for negative outcomes after BS.Copyright © 2016 The Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine.

The current pilot study evaluated the impact of Adapted Motivational Interviewing (AMI) on patients' readiness for change, self-efficacy, and adherence to dietary guidelines following bariatric surgery.A randomized wait-list controlled trial was conducted. Post-operative bariatric patients (N=51) were randomly allocated to receive the single session AMI intervention either immediately (AMI group; n=23), or in 12weeks while continuing to receive standard bariatric care (wait list control [WLC] group; n=28).Completer analyses (n=44) indicated that participants reported improvements in readiness, confidence, and self-efficacy for change immediately following the AMI intervention. They also reported improvements in binge eating symptomatology and some measures of dietary adherence across the 12-week follow-up period. Significant Group×Time interactions for confidence for change, dietary adherence, and binge eating symptomatology suggest that the AMI group improved on these outcomes whereas the control group did not.These preliminary findings suggest that AMI is an acceptable and feasible intervention with the potential to improve bariatric patients' confidence for change and eating behaviors. Future research should examine these results in comparison to routinely collected postsurgery follow-up data to learn more about AMI's efficacy for improving post-surgical adherence.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), can be challenging to access due to physical limitations and practical barriers. Telephone-based CBT (Tele-CBT) can improve eating psychopathology and psychological distress before and after surgery. Given the frequent occurrence/recurrence of problematic eating-related and psychological issues many patients face 1-year post-surgery, this open-trial pilot study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Tele-CBT delivered 1-year post-surgery as an adjunctive treatment to the usual standard of bariatric care.Patients (n=43) received six 1-h Tele-CBT sessions delivered weekly beginning at 1-year post-surgery. Patients completed questionnaire packages before and after the intervention to assess changes in binge eating (BES), emotional eating (EES), depression (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7).Thirty-two patients completed Tele-CBT yielding a 74.4% completion rate. Participants reported significant improvements on the Binge Eating Scale (t(31)=3.794, p=0.001), Emotional Eating Scale (t(31)=3.508, p=0.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item Scale (z=-2.371, p=0.018), and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 Item Scale (z=-3.546, p<0.001) immediately following Tele-CBT.The results demonstrate that Tele-CBT delivered 1-year post-surgery may improve binge eating, emotional eating, depression, and anxiety.

Mitochondria play a key role in adipose tissue energy metabolism and constitute the main source of cellular ROS such as H(2)O(2). Polyphenols constitute the most abundant antioxidants provided by the human diet. Indeed, they are widely distributed in fruits, vegetables and some plant-derived beverages such as coffee and tea. Thus, the biological effects of dietary polyphenols that may increase the antioxidant capacity of the body against obesity-induced oxidative stress are of high interest. Here, we studied the capacity of polyphenols to modulate the impact of oxidative stress on the mitochondria of preadipocytes, which are important cells governing the adipose tissue development for energy homeostasis. Whereas H(2)O(2) treatment induces a proliferation arrest associated with an increase in mitochondrial content in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, preconditioning with some major dietary polyphenols totally or partially protects the cells against oxidative stress consequences.

Due to the presence of TDZ, these calli were under permanent chemical treatment and the differentiation of adventitious shoots from protocorm-like-bodies (PLBs) was blocked. When embryogenic calli were transferred onto a medium without TDZ, shoot organogenesis and plantlet regeneration occurred. To gain better knowledge about the biochemical and molecular processes involved in the morphoregulatory role of TDZ, hormonal and metabolomic analyses were performed. Our results indicate that in the presence of TDZ, embryogenic calli contained a high amount of abscisic acid (ABA) essentially metabolized into abscisic acid glucosyl ester (ABAGE) and phaseic acid (PA), which was the most abundant. When transferred onto a medium without TDZ, shoot regeneration and development take place in four stages that include: embryogenic calli growth, differentiation of PLBs from meristmatic cells zones (MCZ), shoot organogenesis from PLBs and the elongation of well-formed shoots. From a hormonal perspective, the significant reduction in ABA metabolism and its readjustment in the ABAGE pathway triggered PLBs formation. However, this first morphogenesis was stimulated by a strong reduction in IAA metabolism. The organogenesis of PLBs into shoots is associated with an increase in ABA catabolism and a gradual shift in cellular metabolism towards shoot differentiation. Thus, the initiation of the elongation process in shoots is correlated with an alteration in metabolite composition, including an increase in  reserves (sucrose/starch) and a rapid decrease in alanine content. Our data highlighted the relationship between endogenous hormone signalling, carbohydrate metabolism and shoot organogenesis in Orchid plants.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Indeed, the nature and extent of the intermolecular contacts developed in such a species may play a role on its stability and, hence, on the overall association rate. To find the binding intermediate, a molecular simulation protocol was used to unbind the ligand by gradually decreasing the biasing forces introduced. The intermediate was subsequently refined with 17 independent stochastic boundary molecular dynamics simulations that provide a consistent picture of the intermediate state. In this state, the core region of the ligand remains stable, notably because of the two anchoring  atoms that correspond to recurrent motifs found in all FKBP12 ligand core structures. Besides, the non-core regions participate in numerous transient intermolecular and intramolecular contacts. The dynamic aspect of most of the contacts seems important both for the ligand to retain at least a part of its configurational entropy and for avoiding a trapped state along the binding pathway. Since the transient and anchoring contacts contribute to increasing the stability of the intermediate, as a corollary, the dissociation rate constant [Formula: see text] of this intermediate should be decreased, resulting in an increase of the affinity constant [Formula: see text]. The present results support our previous conclusions and provide a coherent rationale for explaining the prevalence in high-affinity ligands of (i) the two  atoms found in carbonyl or sulfonyl groups of dissimilar core structures and of (ii) symmetric or pseudo-symmetric mobile groups of atoms found as non-core moieties. Another interesting aspect of the intermediate is the distortion of the flexible 80 s loop of the protein, mainly in its tip region, that promotes the accessibility to the bound state.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17064038>Application of the aza-Achmatowicz oxidative rearrangement for the stereoselective synthesis of the Cassia and Prosopis alkaloid family.</a></h2><p>cis-2-Methyl-6-substituted piperidin-3-ol alkaloids of the Cassia and Prosopis species are readily prepared by a combination of an aza-Achmatowicz oxidative rearrangement and dihydropyridone reduction followed by a stereoselective allylsilane addition to a N-sulfonyliminium ion.

The present study examined haemodynamic responses to inhaled NO in the normal and constricted pulmonary circulation of unanaesthetized newborn lambs. Three experiments were conducted on each of 7 lambs. First, to determine a minimum concentration of NO which could reverse acute pulmonary hypertension caused by infusion of the thromboxame mimic U46619, the haemodynamic effects of 5 different doses of inhaled NO were examined. Second, the effects of inhaling 80 ppm NO during hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction were examined. Finally, to determine if tachyphalaxis occurs during NO inhalation, lambs were exposed to 80 ppm NO for 3 h during which time pulmonary arterial pressure was doubled by infusion of U46619. Breathing NO (80 ppm) caused a slight but significant decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in lambs with normal pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP). Nitric oxide, inhaled at concentrations between 10 and 80 ppm for 6 min (F1O2 = 0.60), caused decreases in PVR when PAP was elevated with U46619. Nitric oxide acted selectively on the pulmonary circulation, i.e. no changes occurred in systemic arterial pressure or any other measured variable. Breathing 80 ppm NO for 6 min reversed hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. In the chronic exposure study, inhaling 80 ppm NO for 3 h completely reversed U46619-induced pulmonary hypertension. Although arterial methaemoglobin increased during the 3-h exposure to 80 ppm NO, there was no indication that this concentration of NO impairs  loading. These data demonstrate that NO, at concentrations as low as 10 ppm, is a potent, rapid-action, and selective pulmonary vasodilator in unanaesthetized newborn lambs with elevated pulmonary tone.

Alpha-adrenergic blockade completely eliminated both of these responses. The response of the fetal pulmonary circulation was unlike that seen in the postnatal animal. Although there was a slight elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance initially, the predominant response was a decrease in resistance. The decrease in fetal pulmonary vascular resistance was unaffected by phenoxybenzamine, but reversed by propranolol. After the beta-adrenergic blockade, increased intracranial pressure produced an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. Similarly, ventilation of fetal lungs resulted in an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance after increased intracranial pressure. These results demonstrate for the first time that pulmonary vascular resistance may be altered in fetal and neonatal animals by increasing intracranial pressure. The elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance after elevated intracranial pressure must be due to an active pulmonary vascular constriction.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11464181>Complete molecular remission during biologic response modifier therapy for Sézary syndrome is associated with enhanced helper T type 1 cytokine production and natural killer cell activity.</a></h2><p>Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a clonally derived, skin-invasive malignancy of CD4(+) T lymphocytes with the phenotype of mature helper T cells.

Immunization with the protein antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin after initiation of ExP therapy resulted in sustained T-cell proliferative responses up to 6 months in 3 of 3 patients.These results, along with the observation of no increased incidence of opportunistic infections or neoplasms, suggest that ExP is not broadly immunosuppressive and does not prevent primary responses to vaccination or other antigenic challenges.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7555121>Nitric oxide administration using constant-flow ventilation.</a></h2><p>Nitric oxide (NO) gas is known as both a vasodilator and a toxin. It can react with  to form compounds more toxic than itself, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The reactions are time dependent; thus, infusing NO into breathing circuits as close to ventilated subjects as possible may help minimize toxic byproduct exposure. Unfortunately, flow rates commonly used with mechanical ventilation favor laminar gas flow (streaming) within the breathing circuits. Streaming could delay mixing of NO with other inhaled gases. This mixing delay may interfere with accurate monitoring and/or delivery of NO. We tested the hypothesis that streaming of NO infused by constant flow into the inspiratory limb of a constant-flow mechanical ventilation system can lead to NO concentration delivery estimate errors. We then compared the NO2 concentrations at the ventilator Y-piece with three different NO mixing methods: blending the gases before they reach the breathing circuit inspiratory limb, infusing NO directly into the breathing circuit inspiratory limb far enough from the Y-piece to ensure thorough mixing, and infusing NO directly into the breathing circuit inspiratory limb immediately before the gases reach an in-line mixing device placed close to the Y-piece. Our results indicate that streaming can lead to NO concentration delivery estimate errors and that these errors can be characterized by measuring NO concentration variations across the inspiratory tubing's luminal diameter. NO2 concentration measured at the ventilator Y-piece were dependent on NO concentrations (p < 0.0001), NO delivery methods (p < 0.0001), and interactions between NO concentrations and NO delivery methods (p < 0.0001). We conclude that gas streaming and toxic byproduct exposure should be considered together when choosing an NO delivery method.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6438033>Perinatal pulmonary responses to arachidonic acid during normoxia and hypoxia.</a></h2><p>Dilator prostaglandins are released from the perinatal lung in response to ventilation and also may be involved in the pressor response to hypoxia. However, arachidonic acid, precursor of bisenoic prostaglandins, causes pulmonary vasoconstriction when infused into the pulmonary circulation of perinatal goats. The effects of hypoxia on the arachidonic acid-induced increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were evaluated in ventilated fetal and neonatal lambs using an in situ pump-perfused lower left lobe preparation. These studies indicate that pulmonary vascular effects in newborns due to arachidonic acid are not altered by hypoxia. In contrast, ventilated fetuses show a greater response to arachidonic acid infused during hypoxia than during normoxia. However, this increase in PVR is merely additive to the hypoxic pressor response; thus, hypoxia does not appear to affect the actions of exogenous arachidonic acid in the perinatal pulmonary circulation. The decrease in systemic arterial pressure seen with arachidonic acid infusion is greater at the termination of the combined infusion and hypoxia than after infusion alone. This systemic hypotension is also of longer duration and may indicate a greater release of dilator prostaglandins from the lung following hypoxia and arachidonic acid.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25248509>Employment outcomes one year after bariatric surgery: the role of patient and psychosocial factors.</a></h2><p>Patients undergoing bariatric surgery generally report improved work performance after this procedure; however, previous research has been limited by a lack of standardized employment measures and a failure to account for the impact of psychiatric illness on employment outcomes. To address these limitations, this study aims to assess changes in patients' employment impairment and productivity 12 months post-surgery and to identify psychosocial predictors of change in employment outcomes.A total of 164 patients underwent bariatric surgery between February 2010 and November 2012 in this prospective cohort study. The primary outcome was a change in employment impairment (EI) as measured by total Lam Employment Absence and Productivity Scale (LEAPS) scores and changes in participants' job status category. Multiple linear regression models assessed whether baseline demographic or clinical factors, including a history of psychiatric illness and changes in depressive, anxiety and quality of life (QOL) symptoms, were associated with a change in LEAPS scores.Participants reported a significant reduction in EI post-surgery (p < 0.0001) and improvement in work productivity (p < 0.0001) 12 months after surgery. Only changes in depression (confidence interval (CI) 0.46, 0.76, p < 0.0001), anxiety (CI 0.49, 0.85, p < 0.0001) and mental QOL (CI -0.30, -0.17, p < 0.0001) were significant predictors of change in EI total scores. Logistic regression analysis did not identify significant predictors of change in participant job status.Patients with pre-bariatric surgery psychiatric distress are more likely to report greater employment impairment and worse employment productivity pre-surgery. These patients also experience the greatest improvements in post-surgery employment functioning.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22487595>Olean-18-ene triterpenoids from Celastraceae species inhibit HIV replication targeting NF-kB and Sp1 dependent transcription.</a></h2><p>In the present study we report the isolation of nine new olean-18-ene triterpenes (1-9), along with three known ones (10-12), from  xylocarpa and Maytenus jelskii.

Frigatebirds often perform that kind of flight, at daytime as well as in the night. This suggests that they are capable of flying inside clouds in a controlled and stabilized manner. The control requirements for ascents in terms of a circling flight in updrafts of trade cumulus clouds are analyzed, and the necessary aerodynamic control moments are determined. Based on a stability investigation, it is shown that there are restoring effects which act against disturbances causing possible deviations from the circling flight condition. The aerodynamic moments which effectuate that stabilization are identified. Furthermore, the problem of neutral azimuth stability which generally exists in the flight of birds and which is the reason for continually increasing deviations from the course is dealt with. It is shown for the circling flight mode of frigatebirds inside clouds that, here, deviations are small and remain constant, suggesting that a corrective control action is not required. This is particularly important for circling flight in conditions without a visual reference, like inside clouds.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the effect of pre-operative psychiatric factors on QOL and weight loss 2-years after surgery.156 patients participated in this prospective cohort study, the Toronto Bariatric Psychosocial Cohort Study, between 2010 and 2014. Patients were assessed pre-surgery for demographic factors, weight, psychiatric diagnosis using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview and symptom measures for QOL, depression and anxiety at pre-surgery and at 1 and 2years post-surgery.At 2-years post-bariatric surgery, patients experienced a significant decrease in mean weight (-48.43kg, 95% [-51.1, -45.76]) and an increase only in physical QOL (+18.91, 95% [17.01, 20.82]) scores as compared to pre-surgery. Multivariate regression analysis identified pre-surgery physical QOL score (p<0.001), younger age (p=0.005), and a history of a mood disorder as significant predictors of physical QOL. Only a history of a mood disorder (p=0.032) significantly predicted mental QOL (p=0.006). Pre-surgery weight (p<0.001) and a history of a mood disorder (p=0.047) were significant predictors of weight loss 2-years post-surgery.Bariatric surgery had a sustained impact on physical QOL but not mental QOL at 2-years post-surgery. A history of mood disorder unexpectedly increased physical QOL scores and weight loss following surgery. Further research is needed to determine if these results are due to bariatric surgery candidate selection within this program.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The research into new medicines is urgent, especially as there is currently no specific treatment. In this study, the authors have selected 64 endemic plants from the Mascarene Islands based on their endemism, their medicinal use and their registration in the French Pharmacopeia to evaluate the antiplasmodial, anti-chikungunya and antioxidant activities. The list of these 64 plants including their local name, population, data of collection and voucher number are available in the Supporting Information. Forty active extracts were identified from the 38 species: 22 responded positively to the antiplasmodial activity, 8 to the anti-chikungunya activity and 8 to the antioxidant activity. Six plants demonstrated high antiplasmodial activity (concentration inhibiting 50% of parasitic growth (IC) <5 µg/mL): Casearia coriaceae, Monimia rotundifolia, Poupartia borbonica, Psiadia retusa, Vernonia fimbrillifera and Zanthoxylum heterophyllum; and five showed high anti-chikungunya activity (IC<20 µg/mL): Aphloia theiformis, Stillingia lineata, Croton mauritianus, Indigofera ammoxylum, and Securinega durissima.

However, the absence of chromophores makes their structural elucidation by conventional methods a great challenge. In this context, mass spectrometry emerges as a powerful tool for metabolomics studies.The piperidine alkaloids (-)- and (-)-spectaline and the semisynthetic derivatives (-)-3-O-acetylcassine and (-)-3-O-acetylspectaline were investigated by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) in the positive mode and electron ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS). ESI fragmentation studies were performed with a quadrupole time-of-flight instrument; N was used as collision gas. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of the investigated compounds was evaluated by bioautography and microplate screening assays.ESI-MS/MS and EI-MS provided valuable and complementary information about the structure of the piperidine compounds. Collision-induced dissociation experiments (MS/MS) revealed that neutral elimination of water or acetic acid is the major fragmentation pathway, which agrees with the stereochemistry proposed for (-)- and (-)-spectaline and the semisynthetic derivatives (-)-3-O-acetylcassine and (-)-3-O-acetylspectaline.The ESI-MS/MS and EI-MS studies allowed us to propose fragmentation mechanisms for piperidine alkaloids and derivatives.

Circulation to the lower left lobe of the fetal lung was isolated in situ and perfused at constant flow with blood withdrawn from the inferior vena cava. Injection of graded doses of ET-1 into the left pulmonary artery decreased pulmonary arterial perfusion pressure in a dose-related manner. At doses of 100, 300, and 1,000 ng, pulmonary vascular resistance per kilogram body weight (PVR/kg) was decreased 30, 40, and 42%, respectively.

We show that alkaloids 1/2 have an important antiproliferative activity on HepG2 cells due to their ability in inducing cell cycle arrest in G1/S transition. This effect was associated to ERK inactivation and down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression.

Dietary antigen elimination induces clinical and histological remission in patients with EoE. The most restrictive of elimination diets (the elemental diet) removes all possible food antigens while empiric elimination diets remove all (or a subset) of food antigens most commonly reported to cause esophageal eosinophilia and food allergies (milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, or legumes). Elimination diets are effective treatments for EoE but pose psychosocial and financial challenges to patients and consequently may impair quality of life. Foods that are commonly eliminated, especially milk, are also nutrient-dense and therefore their elimination may result in inadequate nutrient intake or deficiencies without careful diet planning to include nutritionally comparable and safe food substitutes. After remission is achieved with elimination diets, foods can be reintroduced sequentially to identify specific food triggers, but this reintroduction is not standardized.

CGRP is released from peripheral nerves that, in the skin, are in close physical association with dendritic APC. We sought to investigate the mechanisms by which CGRP can inhibit immune responses by studying its effects on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Using allogeneic monocytes as stimulator cells, CGRP could inhibit the proliferation of PBMC by 47% when CGRP was present for the duration of culture. Interestingly, when the stimulator monocytes were incubated with CGRP for 2 h prior to irradiation then washed, the observed inhibition increased to 85%, suggesting that CGRP was exerting a direct effect on the monocyte stimulator population. Finally, the recall response to tetanus toxoid (TT) by PBMC from individuals vaccinated with TT 14 d prior was inhibited by 25-50% in the presence of CGRP. Also, CGRP decreased the levels of B7.2 but not B7.1 on treated monocytes, and this inhibition could be abrogated by the addition of anti-IL-10 antibody, suggesting that the inhibition was mediated by an increase in IL-10 production. Moreover, increased IL-10 production was confirmed by ELISA. Both IL-12 p40 and IFN-gamma levels in CGRP-treated cultures were found to be decreased by approximately 30%. The decrease in IL-12 p40 levels could be reversed by addition of anti-IL-10.

The two fungi had a similar number of peptidase genes, and trypsin was transcribed at high levels by both fungi early in infection. L. biglobosa 'canadensis' infection activated the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid defence pathways in B. napus, consistent with defence against necrotrophs. L. maculans 'brassicae' triggered a high level of expression of isochorismate synthase 1, a reporter for salicylic acid signalling.

The polyphenolic composition and antioxidant potential of Mauritian endemic plants of the Rubiaceae, Ebenaceae, Celastraceae, Erythroxylaceae and Sterculaceae family were determined. The phenolics level of the plant extracts varied from 1 to 75 mg/g FW, the maximum level measured in Diospyros neraudii (Ebenaceae). Coffea macrocarpa showed the highest flavonoids content with 18+/-0.7 mg/g FW. The antioxidant capacity based on the TEAC and FRAP values were strongly related to total phenolics and proanthocyanidins content, while a weaker correlation was observed with (-) gallic acid. Erythroxylum sideroxyloides showed the highest protective effect in the lipid peroxidation systems with IC(50) of 0.0435+/-0.001 mg FW/ml in the Fe(3+)/ascorbate system and 0.05+/-0.002 mg FW/ml in the AAPH system.  orientalis, E. sideroxyloides, Diospyros mellanida and Chassalia coriancea var. johnstonii were weakly prooxidant only at higher concentration greater of 10 g FW/L indicating potential safety. Mauritian endemic plants, particularly the genus Diospyros, are good sources of phenolic antioxidants and potential candidates for the development of prophylactic agents.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827011>Disordered Eating Among Individuals with Excess Weight: a Review of Recent Research.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this review was to examine different forms of disordered eating among individuals with excess weight, including their rates, correlates, and psychosocial treatments.Binge eating/binge eating disorder, loss of control eating, emotional eating, and food addiction are all fairly prevalent among individuals with excess weight. They appear to share many of the same correlates, including broader eating disorder psychopathology, body/shape/weight concerns, depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and third-wave (e.g., acceptance, mindfulness) therapies appear effective in improving binge eating, loss of control eating, emotional eating, associated features (e.g., weight and shape concerns), and psychological distress (e.g., depression). Certain forms of disordered eating are elevated among individuals with excess weight, and psychosocial interventions have been found effective in improving symptomatology. Empirical research examining the efficacy of treatments for food addiction is lacking, and greatly needed given both its rate and controversy.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27491293>A Pilot Study on Telephone Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Patients Six-Months Post-Bariatric Surgery.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a post-operative telephone-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention (Tele-CBT) in improving eating pathology and psychosocial functioning.Six-month post-operative bariatric surgery patients (n = 19) received six sessions of Tele-CBT. Study outcome variables included binge eating (BES), emotional eating (EES), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7).Retention was 73.7 % post-intervention.

Tele-CBT patients experienced a mean weight loss of 8.62 ± 15.02 kg between 6-months post-surgery (pre-Tele-CBT) and 12-months post-surgery.These preliminary results suggest that post-surgery Tele-CBT is feasible and can improve post-surgery symptoms of psychopathology in this uncontrolled study, supporting the need for a randomized controlled trial.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447318>Psychosocial Predictors of Response to Telephone-Based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy in Bariatric Surgery Patients.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery is an empirically supported treatment for severe ; however, it does not directly target underlying behavioural and psychological factors that potentially contribute to . Mounting evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for improving eating psychopathology and psychological distress among bariatric patients, and telephone-based CBT (Tele-CBT) is a novel delivery method that increases treatment accessibility.This study aimed to identify demographic and clinical predictors of response to Tele-CBT among 79 patients who received Tele-CBT in 3 previous studies. Listwise deletion was applied, after which 58 patients were included in a multivariate linear regression adjusted for age, sex and education status, to evaluate patient rurality index (urban or nonurban), and baseline binge eating, emotional eating and depression symptoms, as predictors of tele-CBT response.The predictors explained 31% of the observed variance [R=0.312, F(4,57)=3.238, p<0.01]. Patient rurality index (beta=0.341, p<0.01) was the only statistically significant predictor of Tele-CBT response.Given the limited psychosocial resources available in many bariatric surgery programs, the findings suggest that Tele-CBT may be particularly beneficial for patients residing in nonurban communities with limited access to other health-care services.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association.

Albumin, the major circulating protein in blood, can undergo increased glycoxidation in diabetes. Protein glycoxidation can lead to the formation of advanced glycoxidation end products, which induce various deleterious effects on cells. Herein, we report the effect of glucose or methylglyoxal-induced oxidative modifications on BSA or HSA protein structures and on THP1 monocyte physiology. The occurrence of oxidative modifications was found to be enhanced in glycoxidized BSA and HSA, after determination of their free thiol group content, relative electrophoretic migration, carbonyl content, and antioxidant activities. Cells treated with glycoxidized albumin exhibited an overgeneration of intracellular reactive  species, impairments in proteasomal activities, enhancements in RAGE expression, and an accumulation of carbonylated proteins. These novel observations made in the presence of a range of modified BSA and HSA facilitate the comparison of the glycoxidation extent of albumin with the oxidative stress induced in cultured monocytes. Finally, this study reconfirms the influence of experimental conditions in which AGEs are generated and the concentration levels in experiments designed to mimic pathological conditions.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23153925>Immunomodulatory drugs: new options for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes.</a></h2><p>Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are common adult hematologic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with progressive cytopenia and a risk of evolving into currently incurable acute myeloid leukemia. Until recently, the only treatment was bone marrow transplantation, but, over the past few years, a new therapeutic approach based on immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD) has been developed. IMiDs belong to a therapeutic class whose progenitor is thalidomide, a synthetic derivative of glutamate that was initially used because of its sedative and antiemetic properties but was then withdrawn because of its teratogenic effects. IMiDs represent a major advance in the treatment of multiple myeloma at different disease stages, 5q minus syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia with the 5q deletion, mantle cell lymphoma, relapsing or unresponsive high-grade lymphoma, and relapsing indolent lymphoma.Medical databases and conference proceedings were searched to identify articles and clinical trials that have investigated or are investigating the use of IMiDs on MDS.An important part of their in vivo efficacy is attributed to their immunomodulatory properties because they potentiate the immune response by restoring dendritic cell function and inhibiting T-cell regulatory activity, which leads to the activation of T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells by increasing the production of interleukin-2 and interferon gamma. IMiDs are characterized by antitumoral and antiangiogenic activities, and they also induce the apoptosis of neoplastic cells. Thalidomide and its derivative lenalidomide have been proposed for the treatment of MDS because of their action on the immune mechanisms that appear to play an important role in the pathophysiology of this syndrome.This article examines the pharmacology and molecular action of IMiDs and the evidence of their efficacy in treating patients with MDS in different risk classes.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Worldwide, this effluent is responsible for serious environmental issues. In Reunion Island, between 100 and 200 thousand tons of SDW are produced each year by the three local distilleries. In this study, the potential of  to reduce the pollution load of SDW and to produce interesting metabolites has been investigated.The fungal biomass yield was 35 g L corresponding to a yield of 0.47 g of biomass/g of vinasse without nutrient complementation. Analysis of sugar consumption indicated that mono-carbohydrates were initially released from residual polysaccharides and then gradually consumed until complete exhaustion. The high biomass yield likely arises from polysaccharides that are hydrolysed prior to be assimilated as monosaccharides and from organic acids and other complex compounds that provided additional C-sources for growth. Comparison of the size exclusion chromatography profiles of raw and pre-treated vinasse confirmed the conversion of humic- and/or phenolic-like molecules into protein-like metabolites. As a consequence, chemical  demand of vinasse decreased by 53%. Interestingly, analysis of intracellular lipids of the biomass revealed high content in oleic acid and physical properties relevant for biodiesel application.The soft-rot fungus  demonstrated a great ability to grow on vinasse and to degrade this complex and hostile medium. The high biomass production is accompanied by a utilization of carbon sources like residual carbohydrates, organic acids and more complex molecules such as melanoidins. We also showed that intracellular lipids from fungal biomass can efficiently be exploited into biodiesel.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7700732>The effects of nitric oxide inhalation on the pulmonary circulation of preterm lambs.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to test the hypothesis that inhalation of nitric oxide by lambs delivered prematurely would result in increased systemic arterial blood  tension and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance. Eleven premature fetal lambs were delivered by cesarean section at 126-127 d gestation. One hundred min after the onset of ventilation, nitric oxide gas was added to the lambs' breathing mixture. The animals were exposed in random order to 5 ppm for 10 min, 20 ppm for 10 min, and 20 ppm for 20 min. Each treatment period was preceded by and followed by a 10-min washout period. When compared with the washout (control) periods, all three treatment periods resulted in an improvement in both the systemic arterial blood  tension and the physiologic intrapulmonary shunt. Inhalation of nitric oxide also resulted in a selective decrease in pulmonary arterial blood pressure. Comparisons between the different treatment groups revealed a further improvement in blood oxygenation and pulmonary hemodynamics when using the higher concentration of nitric oxide. Interestingly, the rise in arterial blood oxygenation continued after inhaling 20 ppm nitric oxide for more than 10 min.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319502>Prospective Study of Attachment as a Predictor of Binge Eating, Emotional Eating and Weight Loss Two Years after Bariatric Surgery.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery remains the most effective treatment for severe , though post-surgical outcomes are variable with respect to long-term weight loss and eating-related psychopathology. Attachment style is an important variable affecting eating psychopathology among individuals with . To date, studies examining eating psychopathology and attachment style in bariatric surgery populations have been limited to pre-surgery samples and cross-sectional study design. The current prospective study sought to determine whether attachment insecurity is associated with binge eating, emotional eating, and weight loss outcomes at 2-years post-surgery. Patients ( = 108) completed questionnaires on attachment style (ECR-16), binge eating (BES), emotional eating (EES), depression (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7). Multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between attachment insecurity and 2-years post-surgery disordered eating and percent total weight loss. Female gender was found to be a significant predictor of binge eating ( = 0.007) and emotional eating ( = 0.023) at 2-years post-surgery. Avoidant attachment ( = 0.009) was also found to be a significant predictor of binge eating at 2-years post-surgery.

The cured pods of these species are the source of natural vanilla flavor. In intensive cultivation systems the vines are threatened by viruses such as Cymbidium mosaic virus (CymMV). In order to investigate the effect of CymMV on the growth and metabolome of vanilla plants, four accessions grown in intensive cultivation systems under shadehouse, CR01 (V. planifolia), CR17 (V. xtahitensis), CR03 (V. planifolia × V. xtahitensis) and CR18 (Vanilla pompona), were challenged with an isolate of CymMV. CymMV infected plants of CR01, CR03 and CR17 had a reduced growth compared to healthy plants, while there was no significant difference in the growth of CR18 vines. Interestingly, CR18 had qualitatively more phenolic compounds in leaves and a virus titre that diminished over time. No differences in the metabolomic profiles of the shadehouse samples obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were observed between the virus infected vs. healthy plants. However, using in- vitro V. planifolia plants, the metabolomic profiles were affected by virus infection. Under these controlled conditions the levels of amino acids and sugars present in the leaves were increased in CymMV infected plants, compared to uninfected ones, whereas the levels of phenolic compounds and malic acid were decreased. The metabolism, growth and viral status of V. pompona accession CR18 contrasted from that of the other species suggesting the existence of partial resistance to CymMV in the vanilla germplasm.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Part 1: aerosols and ozone interferences.</a></h2><p>Lidar measurements of temperature for the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere are commonly derived by the Raman technique. Lidar signals derived from vibrational Raman processes have been subjected to numerous simulation tests to examine their sensitivity to the presence of aerosols and ozone in the atmosphere. The influence of aerosols characteristics (wavelength dependence of aerosol extinction and particle phase function) and of ozone concentration on Raman temperature profiles is estimated. Simulations indicate large temperature deviations for post-volcanic conditions. For a Raman backscatter at 607 nm, bias is below 1 K for a total optical depth less than 9 x 10(-3) in the case of a stratospheric contamination and less than 6 x 10(-3) for a tropospheric contamination. The effect of aerosols depends on phase function and a few parameters such as altitude, optical depth and the shape of the high-altitude cloud. The wavelength dependence of aerosol extinction has some influence only for severe post-volcanic conditions (Scattering Ratio, SR >2). For a Raman backscatter at 387 nm, bias is larger and can be significant even in background aerosol conditions. Changes in the ozone density profile lead to significant Raman temperature deviations only for some specific conditions. Results suggest that both aerosol and ozone corrections are necessary to obtain an accuracy better than the 1 K requested for most atmospheric applications.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934743>Ethical, Stigma, and Policy Implications of Food Addiction: A Scoping Review.</a></h2><p>The concept of food addiction has generated much controversy. In comparison to research examining the construct of food addiction and its validity, relatively little research has examined the broader implications of food addiction. The purpose of the current scoping review was to examine the potential ethical, stigma, and health policy implications of food addiction. Major themes were identified in the literature, and extensive overlap was identified between several of the themes. Ethics sub-themes related primarily to individual responsibility and included: (i) personal control, will power, and choice; and (ii) blame and weight bias. Stigma sub-themes included: (i) the impact on self-stigma and stigma from others, (ii) the differential impact of substance use disorder versus behavioral addiction on stigma, and (iii) the additive stigma of addiction plus  and/or eating disorder. Policy implications were broadly derived from comparisons to the tobacco industry and focused on addictive foods as opposed to food addiction. This scoping review underscored the need for increased awareness of food addiction and the role of the food industry, empirical research to identify specific hyperpalatable food substances, and policy interventions that are not simply extrapolated from tobacco.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p></html>
