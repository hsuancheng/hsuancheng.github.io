<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27846317>RAS-Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Signal Is Required for Enhanced PD-L1 Expression in Human Lung Cancers.</a></h2><p>Ectopic programmed  death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in non-small  lung cancers (NSCLCs) is related to  evasion by cancer, and it is a molecular target of   therapies. Although some altered signals in NSCLCs are responsible for ectopic PD-L1 expression, the precise mechanisms remain obscure. Because we found a higher frequency of EGFR/KRAS mutations in NSCLC  lines with high PD-L1 expression (p < 0.001), we evaluated the relationships between downstream signals and PD-L1 expression, particularly in three KRAS-mutant adenocarcinoma  lines. The MEK inhibitor U0126 (20 μM) significantly decreased the surface PD-L1 levels by 50-60% compared with dimethyl sulfoxide (p < 0.0001). Phorbol 12-myristate 13- stimulation (100 nM, 15 min) increased (p < 0.05) and two ERK2 siRNAs as well as KRAS siRNAs decreased (p < 0.05) PD-L1 expression. The transcriptional activity of the potential AP-1 site (+4785 to +5056 from the transcription start site) in the PD-L1 gene was demonstrated by luciferase assays, which was inhibited by U0126. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated the binding of cJUN to the AP-1 site. Two STAT3 siRNAs decreased PD-L1 expression by 10-32% in two of the three KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma  lines (p < 0.05), while the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (40 μM) did not change the expression level. Supervised cluster analysis and gene set enrichment analysis between the PD-L1-high and -low NSCLCs revealed a correlation between PD-L1 expression and genes/pathways related to  motility/adhesion. These results indicate that MAPK signaling is the dominant downstream signal responsible for ectopic PD-L1 expression, in which STAT3 is also involved to some extent. Furthermore, MAPK signaling may control the expression of PD-L1 and several genes related to enhanced  motility. Our findings suggest that MAPK, along with STAT3, is important for determining PD-L1 expression, which could be useful for targeted therapies against lung cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29734647>Recent Advances in Prostate Cancer Treatment and Drug Discovery.</a></h2><p>Novel drugs, drug sequences and combinations have improved the outcome of prostate cancer in recent years. The latest approvals include abiraterone , enzalutamide and apalutamide which target androgen receptor (AR) signaling, radium-223 dichloride for reduction of bone metastases, sipuleucel-T immunotherapy and taxane-based chemotherapy. Adding abiraterone  to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in order to achieve complete androgen blockade has proven highly beneficial for treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer and metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Also, ADT together with docetaxel treatment showed significant benefit in mHSPC. Ongoing clinical trials for different subgroups of prostate cancer patients include the evaluation of the second-generation AR antagonists enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide, of inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, of inhibitors of DNA damage response, of targeted alpha therapy and of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting approaches. Advanced clinical studies with   inhibitors have shown limited benefits in prostate cancer and more trials are needed to demonstrate efficacy. The identification of improved, personalized treatments will be much supported by the major progress recently made in the molecular characterization of early- and late-stage prostate cancer using &ldquo;omics&rdquo; technologies. This has already led to novel classifications of prostate tumors based on gene expression profiles and mutation status, and should greatly help in the choice of novel targeted therapies best tailored to the needs of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409649>Local therapy for cancer therapy-associated uveitis: a case series and review of the literature.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy and targeted therapy for metastatic cancer may cause -related adverse events (irAEs) such as uveitis. If irAEs are severe or require systemic steroids, cancer therapy is often held or discontinued. Local steroid therapy for cancer therapy-associated uveitis allows the continuation of cancer therapy. This series demonstrates successful management of cancer therapy-associated uveitis with local therapy based on uveitis subtype.This is an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective case series of patients with uveitis secondary to immunotherapy or targeted therapy managed with local treatment, and focused literature review.Five patients (median age: 54, range 31 to 75) were included. Time to uveitis onset following cancer therapy initiation was 3 to 12 months. All patients received  inhibitor therapy; one patient additionally received targeted therapy. Two patients presented with anterior uveitis, two with panuveitis and one with posterior uveitis. Four of five patients demonstrated evidence of posterior segment inflammation on multimodal imaging. Anterior uveitis was successfully treated with topical prednisolone  1% (PA 1%) alone, and posterior segment involvement recalcitrant to topical PA 1% was treated successfully with topical difluprednate, intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide or a combination. Patients with isolated anterior uveitis did not require maintenance topical therapy; those with posterior and panuveitis required chronic low-dose topical therapy.Based on our series as well as the existing literature demonstrating the use of local therapy for irAEs, we propose an approach to local therapy for cancer therapy-associated uveitis starting with topical steroids and initiating injectable steroids in cases of recalcitrant panuveitis or posterior uveitis. Subclinical inflammation on posterior segment imaging responds robustly to difluprednate or intravitreal steroid therapy, and patients with posterior segment involvement may require more aggressive management and long-term maintenance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

We show here that kinetics of proliferation of PHA activated T cells follows the expression of cMyc. Expression of p53 is also elevated and remains high several days after activation. To investigate the role of p53 in activated T cells, its expression was further elevated with nultin-3 treatment, a small molecule that dissociates the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase MDM2 from p53. Concomitantly, cMyc expression and proliferation decreased. At the other end of the cMyc-p53 axis, inhibition of cMyc with 10058-F4 led to down regulation of p53, likely through the lower level of cMyc induced p14ARF, which is also known to dissociate the p53-MDM2 complex. Both compounds induced   arrest and apoptosis. We conclude that the feedback regulation between cMyc and p53 is important for the T  homeostasis. We also show that the two compounds modulating p53 and cMyc levels inhibited proliferation without abolishing the cytotoxic function, thus demonstrating the dichotomy between proliferation and cytotoxicity in activated T cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31100377>Anhydroglucitol-core gallotannins from red maple buds modulate viability of human blood neutrophils.</a></h2><p>Apoptosis of neutrophils is an essential  for the resolution of inflammation by shutting down the deleterious functions of these  cells. This study investigated the role of anhydroglucitol-core gallotannins (ACGs) in apoptosis increase of human blood neutrophils treated by the hot water extract from red maple buds (RMB). Fractions obtained by liquid-liquid partitioning (ethyl , butanol and water-remaining fractions) of the hot water extract from RMB were assessed for their effects on neutrophil viability by using flow cytometry. These fractions were then phytochemically analyzed to investigate the ability of major compounds to induce neutrophil apoptosis individually. Ethyl  and butanol fractions that contained the major ACGs ginnalin A, ginnalin 3,6 and ginnalin C stimulated the apoptosis of neutrophils. The three ACGs at 100 μM significantly increased the rate of the late apoptotic cells. When differentially combined, these ACGs have additive or antagonist effects. These effects are related to the concentrations of the constituents in the mixtures studied, especially so for ginnalin C. GinA increased FADD, phospho-Rad17, SMAC/Diablo and cytochrome C, while decreasing the anti-apoptotic protein catalase. These compounds could be useful for the development of novel therapeutic approaches that facilitate resolution of neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed an improved humanized mouse model, derived from fresh cord blood CD34 stem cells (CD34 HSC), and combined it with lung cancer  line-derived human xenografts or patient-derived xenografts (Hu-PDX). Fresh CD34 HSCs could reconstitute detectable mature human leukocytes (hCD45) in mice at four weeks without the onset of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Repopulated human T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DC), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) increased in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow over time. Although cultured CD34 HSCs labeled with luciferase could be detected in mice, the cultured HSCs did not develop into mature human  cells by four weeks, unlike fresh CD34 HSCs. , reconstituted T cells, obtained from the tumor-bearing humanized mice, secreted IFNγ upon treatment with phorbol myristate  (PMA) or exposure to human A549 lung tumor cells and mediated antigen-specific CTL responses, indicating functional activity. Growth of engrafted PDXs and tumor xenografts was not dependent on the human leukocyte antigen status of the donor. Treatment with the anti-PD-1  inhibitors pembrolizumab or nivolumab inhibited tumor growth in humanized mice significantly, and correlated with an increased number of CTLs and decreased MDSCs, regardless of the donor HLA type. In conclusion, fresh CD34HSCs are more effective than their expanded counterparts in humanizing mice, and do so in a shorter time. The Hu-PDX model provides an improved platform for evaluation of immunotherapy.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30644695>Elevated Expression of Tim-3 and PD-1   Receptors on T-CD4+ Lymphocytes of Patients with Asthma.</a></h2><p>Asthma is a chronic disorder of the airways characterized by reversible airflow obstruction, inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Different  cells and molecules have been attributed to involve in pathogenesis of asthma. In the current case-control study, the expression of T  Ig and mucin domain-containing molecule-3 (Tim-3) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) was studied on CD4+ T cells of patients with asthma and normal controls. The frequency of Tim-3+/PD-1+/CD4+ T cells was determined by a three color flow cytometry method in 37 patients with asthma and 32 healthy controls. To evaluate the Th1/Th2 ratio, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from all samples and stimulated with phorbol 12- myristate 13-  ( PMA)/ionomycin for 18 h. IFN-γ) and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) were measured in culture supernatants by-(ELISA). Serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) was also measured in all samples. Significant increase in percentage and absolute count of Tim-3+/PD-1+/CD4+, Tim-3+/CD4+ and PD-1+/CD4+ T cells was found in asthmatic patients compared to healthy controls (p=0.02 and p=0.003, respectively). The IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio (Th1/Th2 ratio) was significantly higher in healthy controls than that of asthmatic patients (p=0.029). Our data regarding the increased expression of PD-1 and Tim-3 on CD4+ T cells of patients with asthma suggest the potential roles of these   receptors in  dys-regulation of asthma.</p></html>
