<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26529074>Differences in efficiency, satisfaction and adverse events between self-administered intradermal and nurse-administered intramuscular influenza vaccines in hospital workers.</a></h2><p>Vaccinating healthcare workers against influenza takes tens of thousands of hours of work annually. This study was undertaken to determine the acceptability, success rate, and time to vaccinate healthcare workers in nurse-led groups that self-vaccinated with intradermal influenza vaccine compared with nurse-administered intramuscular vaccine.Volunteer hospital workers were randomly assigned to groups that either self-administered intradermal influenza vaccine (Intanza(®)) in a nurse-led group or received nurse-administered intramuscular vaccine (Vaxigrip(®)). Research assistants timed vaccination procedures; pre- and post-injection questionnaires assessed acceptability and reactogenicity.810 adults, 21-69 years of age, from two study sites were vaccinated: 401 self-administered the intradermal vaccine while 409 received their intramuscular vaccine from a nurse. Of those who self-administered for the first time, 98.5% were successful on their first attempt with an additional 1.5% on their second attempt. Acceptability was high: 96% were very or somewhat certain that they administered the vaccine correctly, 83% would choose intradermal influenza vaccine again and of those, 75% would choose self-administration again, if given the choice. It took 51.3-72. per person for the nurses to guide the groups through the self-administration process, which was significantly less time than it took to individually administer the intramuscular vaccines (93.).Self-administration of intradermal influenza vaccine by people working in healthcare settings is a possible alternative to nurse administered vaccinations, with nurse-led group sessions a good way of teaching the technique while being available to respond to unanticipated problems ().Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Pneumococcal antibody responses were measured using 22F-inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and functional opsonophagocytic activity. Responses to other antigens were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Adverse events were recorded.One month postprimary vaccination, for each vaccine serotype ≥98% of infants in the < and <6NS groups had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL, except for 6B (≥85%) and 23F (≥89%). Immune responses to PHiD-CV after age-appropriate vaccination in children <2 years did not appear influenced by SCD. All infants were seroprotected/seropositive for diphtheria, tetanus and Bordetella pertussis antigens postprimary and booster vaccination. Safety and reactogenicity profiles were similar in children with or without SCD.PHiD-CV was immunogenic with an acceptable safety profile in children with and without SCD starting vaccination at 8 weeks to 23 months of age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28284607>Transmission of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 1 to and from vaccinated pigs in a one-to-one model.</a></h2><p>The present study examined transmission by contact of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) 1 in a one-to-one model to vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs and from vaccinated infected pigs to other vaccinated pigs. The experiment started by randomly assigning weaned pigs to groups V (n=24) and U (n=26). V pigs were vaccinated with a commercial live attenuated PRRSV vaccine and the U animals were kept as unvaccinated controls. Twenty-eight days later, 6U pigs were separated and allocated in individual boxes. The remaining 20U pigs were intranasally inoculated with PRRSV isolate 3267 (from now on designated as seeder (S) pigs) and 48h later were distributed in boxes where they were commingled with either V or U pigs in 1:1 groups (first contact phase), resulting in :U and 14S:V pairs. As soon as a V pig was detected to be viremic because of contact with a S, the infected V (from now on designated as V) was transferred (<24h after detection) to a new pen where it was comingled with a new V pig (designated as V) in a second contact phase. For the first contact phase, pigs were maintained 21days at maximum and for the second contact phase the maximum exposure period was 14days. Two V pigs tested positive for the vaccine virus (>99.5% similarity) when they were relocated with the corresponding V pigs and they were removed; thus, only 12V were finally considered. All V pigs (12/12) exposed to S animals became infected although the first detection of viremia occurred at 13.6±3.6days, one week later than in U (p<0.05). Also, duration of viremia was shorter for V compared to U, (5.5±4.3days versus 12.5±2.7days). The V group showed remarkable individual variability: eight animals had a viremic period of 5 or less days (3.0±1.4) while the remaining four had a longer viremic period of more than one week (10.8±2.9). This situation was not observed in U. In the second contact phase, transmission from V to V pigs occurred in 7/8 cases (87.5%). The mean duration of viremia for V was 4.8±3.4 and two different patterns were again observed: two animals had viremias of 9-10days and the rest averaged 3.0±1.4days (range: 2-5days). Vaccinated groups V and V had a significantly lower PRRSV shedding in oral fluids for at least the first 9days after the onset of the viremia compared to U, and shedding for V2 was even significantly lower (p<0.05) than shedding for V. Our experimental design reproduced the worst-case scenario for evaluating the effect of vaccination and, under such conditions; it was still efficacious in slowering PRRSV transmission and decreasing the global viral load and particularly oral shedding.Copyright © 2016.

The heterogeneity of this group of patients has been shown, as well as many different prognostic factors, that will determine a specific management to each of them. Although the standard treatment is based on a multimodality therapy consisting of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, surgery is not always indicated. The selection of patients who are going to be operated, reminds being a key point of the treatment of this disease. Recent reports on operable N2 disease have been reviewed by our group in order to discuss surgery indications and when to bring it about, with the possibility to go straight to surgery.</p></html>
