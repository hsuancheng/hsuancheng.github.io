The nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway has been considered a potential target for neuroprotection in stroke. Acetyl-11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid (AKBA) is an active triterpenoid compound from the extract of Boswellia serrate. The present study was to determine whether AKBA, a novel Nrf2 activator, can protect against cerebral ischemic injury. The stroke model was produced in Sprague-Dawley rats via middle cerebral artery occlusion. To model ischemia-like conditions in vitro, primary cultured cortical neurons were exposed to transient oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Treatment of AKBA significantly reduced infarct volumes and apoptotic cells, and also increased neurologic scores by elevating the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in brain tissues in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats at 48 hours post reperfusion. In primary cultured neurons, AKBA increased the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, which provided protection against OGD-induced oxidative insult. Additionally, AKBA treatment increased Nrf2 binding activity to antioxidant-response elements (ARE). The protective effect of AKBA was attenuated by knockdown of Nrf2 or HO-1. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence that AKBA protects neurons against ischemic injury, and this neuroprotective effect involves the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26162321>Enhanced Neuroprotection of Acetyl-11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid (AKBA)-Loaded O-Carboxymethyl Chitosan Nanoparticles Through Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Pathways.</a></h1><p>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a main active constituent from Boswellia serrata resin, is a novel candidate for therapy of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Nevertheless, its poor solubility in aqueous solvent, bioavailability, and rapid clearance limit its curative efficacy. To enhance its potency, in our study, AKBA-loaded o-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticle (AKBA-NP) delivery system was synthesized. The transmission electron microscopy and transmission electron microscope images of AKBA-NPs suggested that particle size was 132 ± 18 nm, and particles were spherical in shape with smooth morphology. In pharmacokinetics study, AKBA-NPs apparently increases the area under the curve of plasma concentration-time and prolonged half-life compared with AKBA. The tissue distribution study confirmed that AKBA-NPs had a better brain delivery efficacy in comparison with AKBA. The results from our pharmacodynamic studies showed that AKBA-NPs possess better neuroprotection compared with AKBA in primary neurons with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model and in animals with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Additionally, AKBA-NPs modulate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways more effectively than AKBA by increasing nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 expression, and by decreasing nuclear factor-kappa B and 5-lipoxygenase expression. Collectively, our results suggest that AKBA-NPs serve as a potent delivery vehicle for AKBA in cerebral ischemic therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28363852>Understanding the role of 3-O-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid in conditions of oxidative-stress mediated hepatic dysfunction during benzo(a)pyrene induced toxicity.</a></h1><p>The present study was planned to see whether 3-O-Acetyl-11- keto-β-boswellic acid has any protective effects against benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) induced toxicity or not. In vitro studies show concentration dependent linear association of radical scavenging activity of AK which is comparable to ascorbic acid taken as reference compound. For in vivo studies, the animals were divided randomly into five groups which included a) normal control, b) vehicle treated (olive oil), c) BaP treated, d) AK treated and e) AK + BaP (combined treated). BaP was administered at a dose of 50mg/kg in olive oil twice a week orally for 4 weeks and AK (50mg/kg) was given in olive oil thrice a week for 4 weeks before and after BaP exposure. BaP treated animals showed a significant increase (p < 0.001) in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonyl contents (PCC) in hepatic tissue. Further, a significant increase (p < 0.001) in the liver marker enzymes as well as citrulline and nitric oxide levels in the hepatic tissue was also observed. Interestingly, AK when supplemented to BaP treated animals ameliorated the above said biochemical indices appreciately. The histopathological observations also showed appreciable improvement when BaP treated animals were supplemented with AK, thus emphasing the protective potential of AK.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these drugs have the poor bioavailability, which may be caused by their extensive . In this study, we systemically characterized both phase I and II  of AKBA and KBA in vitro. In total, four major metabolites were firstly biosynthesized and identified using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Among them, three metabolites were novel. The kinetic parameters (K m , V max , CL int, and K i ) were also analyzed systematically in various biological samples. Finally, the deacetylation of AKBA and hydroxylation of KBA were confirmed to be the major   based on their large CL int and the high amounts of KBA (46.7%) and hydroxylated KBA (50.8%) along with a low amount of AKBA (2.50%) in human primary hepatocytes. Carboxylesterase 2 (CE2) selectively catalyzed the deacetylation of AKBA to form KBA. Although CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 catalyzed the  of KBA, CYP3A4 played a predominant role in the hydroxylation reaction of KBA in human. Notably, deacetylation and regioselective hydroxylation exhibited considerable species differences. Deacetylation was only observed in human liver microsomes and primary human hepatocytes; 21- and 20-mono-hydroxylation of KBA were primarily observed in human, monkey, and dog; and 16- and 30-mono-hydroxylation were observed in other species. More importantly, all four mono-hydroxylation metabolites exhibited a moderate anti-inflammatory activity. The 21- and 20-hydroxylation metabolites inhibited the expression of iNOS, the LPS-induced activation of IkBα and p65 phosphorylation, and suppressed p65 nuclear translocation in RAW264.7 cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29513961>NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECT OF BOSWELLIA SERRATA AND ITS ACTIVE CONSTITUENT ACETYL 11-KETO-β-BOSWELLIC ACID AGAINST OXYGEN-GLUCOSE-SERUM DEPRIVATION-INDUCED CELL INJURY.</a></h1><p>Oxidative stress plays a key role in pathophysiology of brain ischemia. This study aimed to test whether B. serrata hydroalcoholic extract (BSE) and its active constituent 3-acetyl-1 1-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) could protect neurons against ischemic condition induced by oxygen, glucose and serum deprivation (OGSD). First, PC12 neural cells were incubated with BSE (0-400 pg/mL) or AKBA (0-40 pg/mL) for 24 h to find non-cytotoxic concentrations of BSE and AKBA. Then, the cells were pre- (for 2 h) and co-treated with 1.5-6 μg/mL BSE or 0.5-2.5 pg/mL AKBA, and then exposed to OGSD condition for 6 h. The IC50. values of BSE and AKBA were 95 and 12.2 μg/mL, respectively. BSE (3 and 6 pg/mL) and AKBA (1 and 2.5 pg/mL) significantly increased viability of ischemic cells, in a concertation-dependent manner. The levels of intracellular oxygen free radicals, lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage were also significantly and concentration-dependently decreased following treatment of ischemic cells with BSE or AKBA. Using HPLC analysis, the mount of AKBA in a sample of BSE was found to be 9.2%. In conclusion, B. sernata and AKBA reduce neuronal cell death induced by OGSD and this neuroprotective effect is mediated via attenuation of oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29079998>Role of 3-Acetyl- in Counteracting LPS-Induced Neuroinflammation via Modulation of miRNA-155.</a></h1><p>Neuroinflammation is one of the most important mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent inflammogen which causes cognitive dysfunction. Boswellia serrata is known since many years as a powerful anti-inflammatory herbal drug. Its beneficial effect mainly arises from inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) enzyme. 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is the most potent 5-LO inhibitor extracted from the oleo-gum-resin of Boswellia serrata. The aim of the present work is to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of AKBA and dexamethasone (DEX) in LPS-induced neuroinflammatory model. A single intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of LPS (0.8 mg/kg) was injected to induce cognitive dysfunction. The LPS-treated mice were administered for 7 days with either AKBA or DEX at intraperitoneal doses of 5 and 1 mg/kg, respectively. Cognitive, locomotor functions, and anxiety level were first examined. The level of the phosphorylated inhibitory protein for NF-κB, IκB-α (P-IκB-α), was measured, and the expression levels of the inflammatory microRNA-155 (miR-155) and its target gene, suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1), were determined in the brain. Moreover, the level of carbonyl proteins as a measure of oxidative stress and several cytokines as well as markers for apoptosis and amyloidogenesis was detected. Results showed that AKBA and DEX reversed the behavioral dysfunction induced by LPS. AKBA decreased P-IκB-α, miRNA-155 expression level, and carbonyl protein content. It restored normal cytokine level and increased SOCS-1 expression level. It also showed anti-apoptotic and anti-amyloidogenic effects in LPS-injected mice. These findings suggest AKBA as a therapeutic drug for alleviating the symptoms of neuroinflammatory disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24329130>Preparation of amorphous solid dispersions by rotary evaporation and KinetiSol Dispersing: approaches to enhance solubility of a poorly water-soluble gum extract.</a></h1><p>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a gum resin extract, possesses poor water-solubility that limits bioavailability and a high melting point making it difficult to successfully process into solid dispersions by fusion methods. The purpose of this study was to investigate solvent and thermal processing techniques for the preparation of amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) exhibiting enhanced solubility, dissolution rates and bioavailability. Solid dispersions were successfully produced by rotary evaporation (RE) and KinetiSol® Dispersing (KSD). Solid state and chemical characterization revealed that ASD with good potency and purity were produced by both RE and KSD. Results of the RE studies demonstrated that AQOAT®-LF, AQOAT®-MF, Eudragit® L100-55 and Soluplus with the incorporation of dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium provided substantial solubility enhancement. Non-sink dissolution analysis showed enhanced dissolution properties for KSD-processed solid dispersions in comparison to RE-processed solid dispersions. Variances in release performance were identified when different particle size fractions of KSD samples were analyzed. Selected RE samples varying in particle surface morphologies were placed under storage and exhibited crystalline growth following solid-state stability analysis at 12 months in comparison to stored KSD samples confirming amorphous instability for RE products. In vivo analysis of KSD-processed solid dispersions revealed significantly enhanced AKBA absorption in comparison to the neat, active substance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27121241>Antioxidant effects of hydroxysafflor yellow A and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid in combination on isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury in rats.</a></h1><p>Oxidative stress plays an important role in the initiation and development of myocardial injury (MI). The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC‑1α)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway is considered to be a potential target for cardioprotection in MI. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is the major organic acid component extracted from Boswellia serrata Roxb. ex Colebr. Hydroxysafﬂor yellow A (HSYA) is the principal active constituent of Carthamus tinctorius L. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of HSYA and AKBA in combination in vivo and in vitro, as well as the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects. For this purpose, MI was produced in Sprague-Dawley rats by subcutaneous injection with isoproterenol. To model ischemic-like conditions in vitro, H9C2 cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The levels of creatine kinase-MB (CK‑MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were examined as well as apoptotic cell death. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm or MMP) were measured using MitoSOX Red and 5,5',6,6'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) dye. The expression of PGC-1α and Nrf2 was quantified by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. HSYA and AKBA prevented myocardial pathological changes, signiﬁcantly reduced the blood levels of CK-MB and LDH, and decreased apoptotic cell death. They significantly increased the expression of PGC-1α and Nrf2, and the activity of the antioxidant enzyme SOD and also decreased the levels of MDA and ROS. Moreover, the reduction in MMP was partly prevented by HSYA and AKBA. Taken together, these findings elucidate the underlying mechanisms through which HSYA and AKBA protect against MI. Additionally, HSYA and AKBA appear to act synergistically in order to exert cardioprotective effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28009003>Acetyl-11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid Attenuates Prooxidant and Profibrotic Mechanisms Involving Transforming Growth Factor-β1, and Improves Vascular Remodeling in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats.</a></h1><p>Vascular remodeling is an important complication of hypertension with oxidative stress-related profibrotic  involved. The transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) has been shown to be a potential target of vasoprotection, and has multiple roles in vascular remodeling. Acetyl-11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid (AKBA) is one of the active principles of Boswellic acids, and shows antioxidant activity in many diseases. The study is to determine effects of AKBA on systemic oxidative stress of hypertension and vascular remodeling. In the experiments, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used. And in vitro, fibroblast was pretreated with AKBA before Ang II stimuli. In the results, treatment of AKBA markedly reduced oxidative stress, and decreased vascular remodeling by restoring vascular wall parameters and improving vascular reactivity. AKBA dramatically reduced TGF-β1 and Smad3 expression, as shown in immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. In cultured fibroblast, AKBA decreased intracellular ROS levels. Cell viability and proliferation, as well as migration were inhibited by AKBA. Additionally, treatment of AKBA significantly decreased TGF-β1 secretion in culture supernatant. Expression of TGF-β1, Smad3, P-Smad3 and Smad7 were also decreased by AKBA in fibroblast. In conclusion, AKBA is able to attenuate oxidative stress and profibrotic mechanisms, and improve vascular remodeling in hypertension through TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25819335>Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of boswellic acid derivatives as potent VEGFR-2 inhibitors.</a></h1><p>A series of AKBA derivatives were synthesized, and evaluated as potent VEGFR-2 inhibitors. The initial biological evaluation indicated that the introduction of C-24 amide group or a heterocycle at C-2,3 position effectively improved the potency. Further structure-activity relationship analysis showed that amide (7, 23, 25, and 26) and heterocycle (19, 34, and 36) substituted AKBA derivatives displayed more potential anti-proliferation activities than AKBA (1) on HUVECs that express high levels of VEGFR-2. Among all tested compounds, compounds 7 and 19 exhibited the best potency (IC₅₀: 2.36 and 2.13 μM) and obvious inhibitory activities with VEGFR-2 inhibition rates of 96% and 94% at 50 μM, respectively.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

(Burseraceae) is widely used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Anti-inflammatory activity of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA) is impeded by poor oral bioavailability due to its high lipid solubility, rapid phase-1  and poor intestinal permeability.This study developed a poly-dl-lactide-co-glycolide-based nanoparticle formulation of KBA to improve its oral bioavailability and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity.KBA was isolated from the oleo-gum resin of B. serrata, and its nanoparticle formulation (KBA-NPs) was prepared by the emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method. Oral bioavailability of KBA and KBA-NPs was studied at 50 mg/kg p.o. dose in Sprague-Dawley rats, and further evaluated for in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema assay at the same dose level.The prepared KBA-NPs had a particle size of 152.6 nm with polydispersity index of 0.194, 79.7% entrapment efficiency and a cumulative 61.5% release of KBA from KBA-NPs, at 72 h. KBA-NPs showed 60.8% inhibition of rat paw oedema at 5 h as compared to 34.9% as that of KBA. The results of oral bioavailability study and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity showed 7- and 1.7-fold increase in bioavailability and anti-inflammatory activity, respectively, of KBA in KBA-NPs as compared to KBA alone.The results of improved oral bioavailability and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of KBA-NPs suggested successful development of KBA nanoparticle formulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26454138>Bioavailability enhancement of a BCS IV compound via an amorphous combination product containing ritonavir.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the effect of ritonavir (RTV) co-administration on the bioavailability of an amorphous dispersion of acetyl- (AKBA) and to develop a pharmaceutically acceptable AKBA-RTV combination tablet.A pharmacokinetic (PK) study in rats was conducted to evaluate the influence of RTV co-administration on the oral bioavailability of an AKBA amorphous dispersion. KinetiSol was utilized to enable production of an improved RTV formulation that facilitated the development of an AKBA-RTV combination tablet. Following in-vitro characterization, the PK performance of the tablets was evaluated in male beagles.Co-administration of RTV increased oral absorption of AKBA by about fourfold over the AKBA dispersion alone and approximately 24-fold over the pure compound. The improved RTV amorphous dispersion exhibited similar purity and neutral-phase dissolution to Norvir. The AKBA-RTV combination tablets yielded a substantial increase in AKBA's bioavailability in dogs.Oral absorption of AKBA is substantially limited by intestinal CYP3A activity and poor aqueous solubility. Consequently, AKBA's oral bioavailability is maximized by administration from a supersaturating formulation in conjunction with a CYP3A inhibitor.

The nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway has been considered a potential target for neuroprotection in stroke. 11-Keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA) is a triterpenoid compound from extracts of Boswellia serrata. The aim of the present study was to determine whether KBA, a novel Nrf2 activator, can protect against cerebral ischemic injury. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was operated on male Sprague-Dawley rats. KBA (25 mg/kg) applied 1 h after reperfusion significantly reduced infarct volumes and apoptotic cells as well as increased neurologic scores at 48 h after reperfusion. Meanwhile, posttreatment with KBA significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, restored the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and increased the protein Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in brain tissues. In primary cultured astrocytes, KBA increased the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, which provided protection against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced oxidative insult. But knockdown of Nrf2 or HO-1 attenuated the protective effect of KBA.

Also, the available marketed formulation for intravenous administration has its inherent drawbacks owing to the presence of polysorbate 80. Here, we exploited the anticancer and P-gp inhibitory potential of naturally occurring frankincense oil to fabricate a stable docetaxel loaded nanoemulsified carrier system for oral delivery. The nanoemulsion possessing desirable particle size (122±12nm), polydispersity (0.086±0.007) and zeta potential (-29.8±2.1mV) was stable against all type of physical stresses and simulated physiological conditions tested. The formulation showed higher uptake in Caco-2 cells and inhibited P-gp transporter significantly (P<0.05). In MDA-MB-231 cells, it showed less IC, arrested cells in G2-M phase and exhibited higher degree of apoptosis than marketed formulation Taxotere. The 182.58±4.16% increment in relative oral bioavailability led to higher in vivo anti-proliferative activity manifesting 19% more inhibition than Taxotere.

The extract, used at 2.3, 4.6 and 9.3 µg/ml, had no effect, but in combination with IL-1α showed MMP-9 inhibition at the lowest dose and increased upregulation at the highest one. AKBA alone, at the same concentrations (corresponding to 5, 10, and 20 µM), did not stimulate MMP-9, but together with IL-1α induced an increased upregulation at the lowest dose that progressively disappeared at higher doses. WB analysis showed that IL-1α induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, while AKBA abolished this effect at 20 µM, but conversely increased it at 5 µM. Screening of MAP kinase phosphorylation showed a combined activation of IL-1α/AKBA on JNK, while the JNK inhibitor SP600125 abolished MMP-9 upregulation induced by IL-1α/AKBA.The enhancing effect of IL-1α/AKBA on MMP-9 at low AKBA concentration seems to involve the activation of JNK-mediated NF-κB pathway. Conversely, the extract inhibits the IL-1α effect at low doses, but not at higher ones, where AKBA and possibly other β-boswellic acids reach concentrations that potentiate the effect of IL-1α. The extract at low doses could protect the skin against degenerative processes of extracellular matrix, while keto-β-boswellic acids seem unsuitable for this purpose.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Using a simple and reliable reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the amount of 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) in the BSE was found to be 18.5% w/w. The results confirmed that BSE and AKBA, at concentrations as high as 100 μg/mL or 10 μM, respectively, caused no significant cytotoxicity or apoptotic cell death. Co- and pretreatment with BSE (25-100 μg/mL) or AKBA (5 μM) restored the viability of PC12 and N2a cells under glutamate toxicity (8 mM). Treatment with BSE and AKBA also attenuated the toxic effects of glutamate on intracellular reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase activity, and oxidative DNA damage compared with the untreated glutamate-injured cells. Furthermore, BSE and AKBA decreased the apoptotic cell population in the sub-G1 region and the rate of both early and late-stage apoptosis induced by glutamate in the cells. Our data suggest that the protective effects of Boswellia extract and AKBA against glutamate toxicity in PC12 and N2a cells may be mediated through the amelioration of the oxidative stress and the resultant apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26984336>Co-administration of 3-Acetyl- Potentiates the Protective Effect of Celecoxib in Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Cognitive Impairment in Mice: Possible Implication of Anti-inflammatory and Antiglutamatergic Pathways.</a></h1><p>Neuro- is known to initiate the underlying pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders which may progress to cognitive, behavioral, and functional impairment.

The results showed that the combination therapy of AKBA and celecoxib reversed the behavioral and molecular changes caused by LPS cognitive dysfunction model that predispose cognitive dysfunction in mice.

The most efficient were selected for constructing phase diagrams for ME preparation. The bioactive fraction was assayed by high performance liquid chromatography for 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), at 210 nm. The bioactive fraction was incorporated in 6 MEs. ME systems were evaluated for drug content and optimized systems were tested for characterization, permeation, skin irritancy and in vivo evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity.Two systems were selected; ME1 and ME4 composed of Tween 80: PEG 400 at 1:1 and 2:1 ratio, with oil content 7.78 and 17.5%, respectively. The systems showed high encapsulation efficiency >83%, small droplet size <100 nm, and suitable pH for topical application. Permeation parameters for ME1 were higher compared to ME4. Both MEs were non irritant. ME1 showed significantly higher anti-inflammatory activity versus the standard TD anti-inflammatory piroxicam.Optimized TD BC MEs could be used as a safe, effective and long acting alternative to oral anti-inflammatories, providing higher and prolonged efficacy and better patient compliance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26117531>Comparative studies of pharmacokinetics and anticoagulatory effect in rats after oral administration of Frankincense and its processed products.</a></h1><p>Frankincense (FRA), Ruxiang, is the resin of Boswellia carterii Birdw and Boswellia bhaw-dajiana Birdw which has been used for centuries as formulas to improve the circulation and to relieve pain against carbuncles. Stir-fried Frankincense (SFF) and vinegar processed Frankincense (VPF) are two major processed Frankincense, and the processing procedures reportedly enhance the curative efficacy or reduce the side effects of FRA. This paper describes the comparisons in plasma pharmacokinetic behaviors of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA) and 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) in FRA and its processed products, and their effects on coagulation factors and blood clotting tetrachoric, using an acute cold blood-stasis animal model after oral administration of FRA, SFF, and VPF.For pharmacokinetic study, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups, including group FRA, group SFF and group VPF. And the plasma samples were analyzed by HPLC. For study of anticoagulatory effect, SD rats were randomly divided into six groups, including control, acute cold blood-stasis model, Fu-fang-dan-shen tablet- (0.75g/kg), FRA-, SFF-, and VPF-treated (2.7g/kg) groups, respectively. The serum contents of thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), D-dimer (D-D), and prostacyclin (PGI2) of each group were measured by ELISA. The values of prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen (FIB) were also assessed by hematology analyzer.Significantly increased levels of Cmax, AUC, T1/2, and MRT were found in rats treated with the processed products. In addition, decreased levels of D-D and TAT and increased contents of PGI2 were observed in rats given FRA and its processed products, compared with that of the model group. Moreover, VPF improved anticoagulation more than SFF in the animals.The observed improvement of anticoagulation by processed FRA may result from the increased absorption and bioavailability of triterpenoids.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Up to now, the chemotherapy approaches for GBM were limited. 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), the major active ingredient of the gum resin from Boswellia serrata and Boswellia carteri Birdw., was reported to inhibit the growth of many types of  cells; however, the underlying mechanism of its anticancer effects are still unclear.The effects of AKBA on cell viability and its cytotoxicity were determined using CCK8 and LDH kits respectively. The EdU-DNA synthesis assay was used to evaluate inhibition of cell proliferation by AKBA. The role of AKBA in glioblastoma cell functions such as migration/invasion, and colony formation was evaluated using transwell chambers and soft agar, respectively. Flow cytometry and western blotting were used to detect AKBA-induced apoptosis. Potential mechanisms of AKBA action were explored by RNA sequencing and the identified hub genes were validated by real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting. Finally, the in vivo anti-tumor activity of AKBA was evaluated against a human glioblastoma cell line, U87-MG, in a xenograft mouse model.AKBA inhibited cell proliferation, caused the release of LDH, decreased DNA synthesis, and inhibited the migration, invasion, and colony formation of U251 and U87-MG human glioblastoma cell lines. AKBA increased apoptosis as well as the activity of caspase 3/7 and the protein expression of cleaved-caspase 3 and cleaved PARP, while decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential. RNA-sequencing analyses showed that AKBA suppressed the expression of pRB, FOXM1, Aurora A, PLK1, CDC25C, p-CDK1, cyclinB1, Aurora B, and TOP2A while increasing the expression of p21 and GADD45A. These findings were validated by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The data are consistent with a mechanism in which AKBA arrested the cell cycle in glioblastoma cells at the G2/M phase by regulating the p21/FOXM1/cyclin B1 pathway, inhibited mitosis by downregulating the Aurora B/TOP2A pathway, and induced mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Oral administration of AKBA (100 mg/kg) significantly suppressed the tumorigenicity of U87-MG cells in a xenograft mouse model.Taken together, these results suggest that AKBA (molecular weight, 512.7 Da) might be a promising chemotherapy drug in the treatment of GBM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28627258>New water soluble glycosides of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid: A paradigm.</a></h1><p>Though several glycosides of various triterpenes are known, but surprisingly no boswellic acid glycosides are reported so far.

Using male mice (n = 6) diabetes was induced by daily i.p. injections of 40 mg/kg STZ for 5 days. In a second series together with STZ, daily i. p. injections of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA) and O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) (7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg) were applied for 10 days. Thereafter, pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the blood, histochemistry of pancreatic islets, and blood glucose levels were assayed. Five days after the last injection of STZ, a significant burst of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the blood, infiltration of lymphocytes (CD3) into pancreatic islets, and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells were observed. Plasma glucose increased significantly (124.4 ± 6.65 vs. 240.2 ± 27.36 mg/dl, p <0.05). Simultaneous treatment with KBA and AKBA significantly reduced pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ p < 0.01, p < 0.01; IL-1A p < 0.001, p < 0.001; IL-1B p < 0.001, p < 0.001; IL-2 p < 0.001, p < 0.001; IL-6 p < 0.01, p < 0.001; TNF-α p < 0.05, p < 0.001; IL-4 p < 0.01, p < 0.001; IL-10 p < 0.001, p < 0.001) in the blood. No infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular cells were detected.

The main mechanism of action of RA induced bone loss is the significant inhibitory effect of TNF-α on osteoblast differentiation. TNF-α inhibits osteoblast differentiation mainly by activating nuclear factor (NF) -κB signaling pathway. Owing to the crucial role of TNF-α and NF-κB in the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation, they are considered as targets for the development of therapeutic drugs. In the present study, we evaluated the NF-κB inhibitor Boswellic acid (BA) and its derivatives in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and the molecular mechanism. Based on the cell model of TNF-α induced inhibition of osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3-E1, the regulatory role of BAs was studied. The result of MTT assay indicated that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) -2, TNF-α, or acetyl-11-keto-β-BA (AKBA) impact no significant effect for cell viability of MC3T3-E1. The results of alkaline phosphatase (ALP activity assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction indicated that AKBA blocked TNF-α-induced inhibition of the expression of osteoblast markers, suggesting that AKBA rescued osteoblast differentiation from TNF-α-induced inhibition. Additionally, AKBA stimulated the BMP-2-induced expression of osteoblast markers, suggesting that AKBA promotes osteoblast differentiation directly. The results of western blotting and luciferase assay indicated that N-κB signaling was activated by TNF-α. The overexpression of NF-κB component p65 in MC3T3-E1 was found to attenuate the positive effect of AKBA in osteoblast differentiation, suggesting that AKBA potentiates osteoblast differentiation by inhibiting NF-κB signaling. Collectively, AKBA promotes osteoblast differentiation by inhibiting TNF-α and NF-κB. Our study revealed a new discovery of AKBA in regulating osteoblast differentiation, and demonstrated that AKBA may be a potential anabolic agent in the treatment of RA-derived bone loss disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27346540>Pharmacological evidences for cytotoxic and antitumor properties of Boswellic acids from Boswellia serrata.</a></h1><p>Increasing research on traditional herbal medicines and their phytoconstituents has recognized their usefulness in complementary as adjuvant to chemotherapy in various types of cancers. The oleo-gum resin of Boswellia serrata tree is one such folk medicine, which has been traditionally used for religious, cosmetic as well as medical purposes since ages. The oleo-gum resin of the plant has been used in traditional medicine to treat variety of conditions including inflammatory diseases like arthritis, asthma, chronic pain, bowel conditions and many other diseases. This review presents an overview of scientific studies on cytotoxic and antitumor properties of B. serrata and its constituents.Literature search was carried out for activities of B. serrata and various isolated boswellic acids such as β-boswellic acid, 11-keto-β-boswellic acid and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid reported in various cancer types in vitro as well as in vivo.The triterpenoidal fraction of B. serrata (containing boswellic acids) is responsible for the cytotoxic and antitumor properties. Among the screened compounds, 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid has been found to be most promising cytotoxic molecule. The cytotoxic and antitumor effects are mainly due to induction of apoptosis through caspase activation, increased Bax expression, NF-κB down regulation and induction of poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage.Boswellic acids appear to be promising candidates for anticancer drug development in future. However, further in vivo studies are needed. Studies in combination with clinically used anticancer drugs and QSAR studies on individual boswellic acid also need to be carried out.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is a pentacyclic triterpenic acid isolated from the fragrant gum resin of the Boswellia serrata tree, which has shown intriguing antitumor activity against human cell lines established from PCa, colon cancer, malignant glioma, and leukemia. In this study, we examined the effects of AKBA against docetaxel-resistant PCa in vitro and in vivo as well as its anticancer mechanisms. We showed that AKBA dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in docetaxel-resistant PC3/Doc cells; its IC value in anti-proliferation was ∼17 μM. Furthermore, AKBA dose-dependently suppressed the chemoresistant stem cell-like properties of PC3/Doc cells, evidenced by significant decrease in the ability of mammosphere formation and down-regulated expression of a number of stemness-associated genes. The activation of Akt and Stat3 signaling  was remarkably enhanced in PC3/Doc cells, which contributed to their chemoresistant stem-like phenotype. AKBA (10-30 μM) dose-dependently suppressed the activation of Akt and Stat3 signaling  in PC3/Doc cells. In contrast, overexpression of Akt and Stat3 significantly attenuated the inhibition of AKBA on PC3/Doc cell proliferation. In docetaxel-resistant PCa homograft mice, treatment with AKBA significantly suppresses the growth of homograft RM-1/Doc, equivalent to its human PC3/Doc, but did not decrease their body weight. In summary, we demonstrate that AKBA inhibits the growth inhibition of docetaxel-resistant PCa cells in vitro and in vivo via blocking Akt and Stat3 signaling, thus suppressing their cancer stem cell-like properties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25851251>Development and optimisation of 3-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid loaded poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid-nanoparticles with enhanced oral bioavailability and in-vivo anti-inflammatory activity in rats.</a></h1><p>3-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is a potent anti-inflammatory compound of Boswellia serrata.

Although therapies directed toward vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) represent a significant step forward in the treatment of proliferative retinopathies, further improvements are needed. In the last few years, an intense research activity has focused around the use of herbal and traditional natural medicines as an alternative for slowing down the progression of proliferative retinopathies. In the present study, we investigated the antiangiogenic effects of acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), one of the active principles derived from the plant Boswellia serrata, used in Ayurvedic systems of medicine. We studied the antiangiogenic properties of AKBA using the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), which mimics the neovascular response seen in human retinopathy of prematurity. We first evaluated the effects of subcutaneously administered AKBA on the expression/activity of proteins which are known to play a role in the OIR model. In the retina, AKBA increased expression and activity of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 and reduced the phosphorylation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as well as VEGF expression and VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 phosphorylation. Likely as a result of these effects, AKBA significantly reduced retinal neovascularization in OIR mice without affecting retinal cell survival and retinal function. Using retinal explants cultured in hypoxia and an activator of STAT3 phosphorylation, we showed that the AKBA-induced inhibition of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation is likely to be mediated by a mechanism depending on an SHP-1/STAT3/VEGF axis. In the OIR model, neovascularization results from the activation of retinal endothelial cells, therefore we evaluated whether AKBA affected the angiogenic response of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). We observed that AKBA reduced proliferation, migration and tube formation in HRMECs stimulated with exogenous VEGF, while it reduced migration and tube formation in untreated HRMECs. Taken together, our results demonstrate the antiangiogenic effects of AKBA in a model of pathologic neovascularization, providing a rationale for further investigation of AKBA as a promising therapeutic agent to reduce the impact of proliferative retinopathies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this work was to study whether or not KBA can also prevent/attenuate infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells in an animal model of autoimmune  caused by genetic dysfunction resembling human type 1  in several important features. Four weeks old female NOD mice received daily i.p. injections of 7.5 mg/kg of KBA over a period of 3 weeks. Compared to 4 weeks old animals there was significant infiltration of lymphocytes (CD3) into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells in the period between 4 and 7 weeks. During this time plasma glucose dropped significantly and body weight did not increase. As far as pro-inflammatory cytokines are concerned, except a small increase of IFN-γ, there was no change in the blood. In mice that had been treated with KBA between 4 and 7 weeks after birth no significant infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells was observed, when compared to 4 weeks old mice. Moreover, there was no drop of blood glucose and the animals gained body weight. It is concluded that - similar to the model of MLD-STZ- - also in the NOD mouse model KBA is able to attenuate or even prevent development of insulitis, suggesting that KBA protects islets from autoimmune reaction regardless whether the signal is provided by a chemical compound or by genetic dysfunction. Whether this also holds for human type 1  remains to be established.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27545217>Reversal of the multidrug resistance of human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cells by acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid via downregulation of P-glycoprotein signals.</a></h1><p>Multidrug resistance (MDR) represents a clinical obstacle to cancer chemotherapy since it causes cancer recurrence and metastasis. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), an active ingredient derived from the plant Boswellia serrata, has been found to inhibit the growth of a wide variety of tumor cells, including glioma, colorectal cancer, leukemia, human melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate cancer cells. However, the actions of AKBA in multidrug-resistant cancer cells have not been fully elucidated. The current study examined the reversal of MDR by AKBA in a human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cell line with vincristine-induced resistance, HCT-8/VCR. A 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that cytotoxicity increased drastically and the IC50 of VCR in HCT-8/VCR cells decreased in the presence of AKBA. AKBA had a maximum "fold reversal" of MDR (FR) of 9.19-fold. In addition, HCT-8/VCR cells treated with AKBA and VCR exhibited a higher percentage of apoptotic tumor cells according to flow cytometry. The reversal of MDR by AKBA was evident in an intracellular increase in Rhodamine (Rh123), indicating that the activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was blocked. Furthermore, AKBA inhibited the expression of P-gp and decreased levels of expression of multidrug resistance gene 1 in HCT-8/VCR cells. The current results indicated that AKBA might be a potential agent to reverse MDR in human ileocecal adenocarcinoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881407>Quantification of AKBA in Boswellia sacra Using NIRS Coupled with PLSR as an Alternative Method and Cross-Validation by HPLC.</a></h1><p>3-O-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), one of the pentacyclic triterpenoids, is the main biologically active constituent in the resin of Boswellia sacra and has received significant pharmacological interest in recent years.It was aimed to develop a robust method to quantify the AKBA content in methanolic extracts of different parts of B. sacra plants and in various fractions of its resin exudates through near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) coupled with partial least squares regression (PLSR).The near-infrared (NIR) spectra were used to measure the AKBA standards and B. sacra samples at a wavelength range between 700 and 2500 nm in absorption mode. A PLSR model was built from the obtained spectral data using 70% of the AKBA working standard solutions (training set), ranging from 0.1 ppm to 100 ppm. The final PLSR showed a R value of 99% with a root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) value of 0.39% and a R value of 99%.The results showed that a 50% CHCl /n-hexane sub-fraction has the highest concentration of AKBA (14.8%), followed by 55% CHCl /n-hexane (13.6%), and 40% CHCl /n-hexane (6.1%).As the results achieved with the proposed NIRS methodology are in close agreement to the results of AKBA analysis using HPLC, we suggest that our proposed NIRS method is a fast alternative and non-destructive method for the analysis of AKBA in different samples of B. sacra.

A subgroup of boswellic acids, characterized by an 11-keto group, elevates intracellular Ca concentrations [Ca] and causes moderate aggregation of human platelets. How different BAs and their mixtures in pharmacological preparations affect these parameters in activated platelets has not been addressed, so far. Here, we show that boswellic acids either antagonize or induce Ca mobilization and platelet aggregation depending on defined structural determinants with inductive effects predominating for a  gum resin extract. 3--Acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid potently suppressed Ca mobilization (IC = 6 µM) and aggregation (IC = 1 µM) when platelets were activated by collagen or the thromboxane A receptor agonist U-46619, but not upon thrombin. In contrast, -boswellic acid and 3--acetyl--boswellic acid, which lack the 11-keto moiety, were weak inhibitors of agonist-induced platelet responses, but instead they elicited elevation of [Ca] and aggregation of platelets (≥ 3 µM). 11-Keto--boswellic acid, the structural intermediate between 3--acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid and -boswellic acid, was essentially inactive independent of the experimental conditions.

Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is the most bioactive ingredient of boswellic acids, a group of compounds with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Target identification of AKBA and metabolomics analysis of psoriasis helped to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying its effect, and provide new target(s) to treat the disease.To explore the targets and molecular mechanism of AKBA, we performed affinity purification, metabolomics analysis of HaCaT cells treated with AKBA, and epidermis of imiquimod (IMQ) induced mouse model of psoriasis and psoriasis patients.AKBA directly interacts with methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A), inhibited its enzyme activity, decreased level of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and SAM/SAH ratio, and reprogrammed one‑carbon  in HaCaT cells. Untargeted metabolomics of epidermis showed one‑carbon  was activated in psoriasis patients. Topical use of AKBA improved inflammatory phenotype of IMQ induced psoriasis-like mouse model. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis revealed AKBA bound to an allosteric site at the interface of MAT2A dimer.Our study extends the molecular mechanism of AKBA by revealing a new interacting protein MAT2A. And this leads us to find out the dysregulated one‑carbon  in psoriasis, which indicates the therapeutic potential of AKBA in psoriasis.

Here, we describe the identification of human LL-37 as functional target of BAs. In unbiased target fishing experiments using immobilized BAs as bait and human neutrophils as target source, LL-37 was identified as binding partner assisted by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Thermal stability experiments using circular dichroism spectroscopy confirm direct interaction between BAs and LL-37. Of interest, this binding of BAs resulted in an inhibition of the functionality of LL-37. Thus, the LPS-neutralizing properties of isolated LL-37 were inhibited by 3-O-acetyl-β-BA (Aβ-BA) and 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-BA (AKβ-BA) in a cell-free limulus amoebocyte lysate assay with EC50=0.2 and 0.8 μM, respectively. Also, LL-37 activity was inhibited by these BAs in LL-37-enriched supernatants of stimulated neutrophils or human plasma derived from stimulated human whole blood. Together, we reveal BAs as inhibitors of LL-37, which might be a relevant mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory properties of BAs and suggests BAs as suitable chemical tools or potential agents for intervention with LL-37 and related disorders.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Radiation effects on cell morphology, cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and antioxidant enzymes were examined.AKBA reduces UVA irradiation-induced cell viability loss, accompanied by a decreased production of UVA-induced ROS, decreased malondialdehyde, and increased superoxide dismutase expression. In addition, AKBA increased basal and UVA-induced levels of Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2), the redox-sensitive factor, and its target genes NQO1 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), whereas expression of the transcriptional repressor Bach1 (BTB and CNC homology 1) was reduced. Furthermore, the cytoprotective effects of AKBA against UVA-derived oxidative damage were accompanied by modulating expression of inflammatory mediators (i.e., cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor-κB) and NOX1.AKBA protects skin cells from UVA-induced damage by modulating inflammatory mediators and/or ROS production. Therefore, AKBA has potential in the development of skin care products.© 2017 S.

Meanwhile complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is increasing, particularly herbal medicine. Boswellia serrata is a traditional Ayurvedic remedy with anti- properties, of interest for its usefulness in IBDs. The mechanism of this pharmacological potential of Boswellia serrata was investigated in colonic epithelial cell monolayers exposed to H2O2 or INF-γ+TNF-α, chosen as in vitro experimental model of intestinal inflammation. The barrier function was evaluated by the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and paracellular permeability assay, and by the tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, ZO-1 and occludin) immunofluorescence. The expression of phosphorylated NF-κB and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were determined by immunoblot and cytofluorimetric assay, respectively. Boswellia serrata oleo-gum extract (BSE) and its pure derivative acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), were tested at 0.1-10 μg/ml and 0.027 μg/ml, respectively. BSE and AKBA safety was demonstrated by no alteration of intestinal cell viability and barrier function and integrity biomarkers. H2O2 or INF-γ+TNF-α treatment of Caco-2 cell monolayers significantly reduced TEER, increased paracellular permeability and caused the disassembly of tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1. BSE and AKBA pretreatment significantly prevented functional and morphological alterations and also the NF-κB phosphorylation induced by the  stimuli. At the same concentrations BSE and AKBA counteracted the increase of ROS caused by H2O2 exposure. Data showed the positive correlation of the antioxidant activity with the mechanism involved in the physiologic maintenance of the integrity and function of the intestinal epithelium. This study elucidates the pharmacological mechanisms mediated by BSE, in protecting intestinal epithelial barrier from  damage and supports its use as safe adjuvant in patients affected by IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28110820>Synthesis of new analogs of AKBA and evaluation of their anti-inflammatory activities.</a></h1><p>A new series of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid and 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid analogs (5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 18a-d, 27a-c, 28a-d) were synthesized by modification of hydroxyl and acid functional moieties of boswellic acids. The structures of these analogs were confirmed by spectral data analysis (H, C NMR and mass). Compounds 18b, 27a and 8 showed potent 5-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitory activity (IC: 19.53, 20.31 and 44.14μg/mL). The computational studies revealed that selectivity of AKBA is due to its fitment into the 5-LOX receptor, which is missing for the other enzymes like 12-LOX, COX-1 and COX-2. Our study found potentiating effects of 2-formyl and 3-keto substituents in reviving inactive AKBA analogues possessing essential COOH group at 4th position.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The current standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM patients involves maximal surgical debulking, followed by radiation therapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. Despite the advances in GBM therapy, its outcome remains poor with a median survival of less than two years. This poor outcome is partly due to the ability of GBM tumors to acquire adaptive resistance to therapy and in particular to radiation. One of the mechanisms contributing to GBM tumor progression and resistance is an aberrant activation of NF-ĸB, a family of inducible transcription factors that play a pivotal role in regulation of many immune, inflammatory and carcinogenic responses. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is a pentacyclic terpenoid extracted from the gum Ayurvedic therapeutic plant Boswellia serrata. AKBA is anti-inflammatory agent that exhibits potent cytotoxic activities against various types of tumors including GBM. One of the mechanisms underlying AKBA anti-tumor activity is its ability to modulate the NF-ĸB signaling pathway. The present study investigated in vitro and in vivo the effect of combining AKBA with ionizing radiation in the treatment of GBM and assessed AKBA anti-tumor activity and radio-enhancing potential. The effect of AKBA and/or radiation on the survival of cultured glioblastoma cancer cells was evaluated by XTT assay. The mode of interaction of treatments tested was calculated using CalcuSyn software. Inducing of apoptosis following AKBA treatment was evaluated using flow cytometry. The effect of combined treatment on the expression of PARP protein was analysed by Western blot assay. Ectopic (subcutaneous) GBM model in nude mice was used for the evaluation of the effect of combined treatment on tumor growth. Immunohistochemical analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor sections was used to assess treatment-related changes in Ki-67, CD31, p53, Bcl-2 and NF-ĸB-inhibitor IĸB-α. AKBA treatment was found to inhibit the survival of all four tested cell lines in a dose dependent manner. The combined treatment resulted in a more significant inhibitory effect compared to the effect of treatment with radiation alone. A synergistic effect was detected in some of the tested cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining of AKBA treated cells indicated induction of apoptosis. AKBA apoptotic activity was also confirmed by PARP cleavage detected by Western blot analysis. The combined treatment suppressed tumor growth in vivo compared to no treatment and each treatment alone. Immunohistochemical analysis showed anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative activity of AKBA in vivo. It also demonstrated a decrease in p53 nuclear staining and in Bcl-2 staining and an increase in IĸB-α staining following AKBA treatment both alone and in combination with radiotherapy. In this study, we demonstrated that AKBA exerts potent anti-proliferative and apoptotic activity, and significantly inhibits both the survival of glioblastoma cells in vitro and the growth of tumors generated by these cells. Combination of AKBA with radiotherapy was found to inhibit factors which involved in cell death regulation, tumor progression and radioresistence, therefore it may serve as a novel approach for GBM patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27515127>Aqueous and Ethanolic Extracts of Boswellia serrata Protect Against Focal Cerebral Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury in Rats.</a></h1><p>Oxidative stress and cell apoptosis play major roles in neuronal injury after ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury. Boswellia serrata is a medicinal plant with antioxidant properties. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is an active triterpenoid compound from B. serrate. In the current study, the neuroprotective effects of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of B. serrata (named ABS and EBS, respectively) and AKBA were investigated against middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced cerebral I-R injury in rats. ABS and EBS with doses of 125, 250 and 500 and AKBA with a dose of 50 mg/kg were administered (intraperitoneally) just after middle cerebral artery occlusion induction for 30 min and reperfusion for 24 h. HPLC analysis suggested that ABS and EBS had AKBA of 8.8% and 9.5% (w/w), respectively. B. serrata and AKBA significantly improved neurological deficit and reduced brain infarction, neuronal cell loss and apoptosis and also attenuated lipid peroxidation while increasing glutathione content and superoxide dismutase activity in the cerebral cortex following a stroke. Apoptosis suppression was found to be mediated through regulating caspase-3 and bax/bcl-2 expressions. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that B. serrata and AKBA attenuate oxidative damage and inhibit cell apoptosis, subsequently protecting cerebral I-R injury in rats.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30084990>Chemoprevention of inflammation-related colorectal  by silymarin-, acetyl--, curcumin- and maltodextrin-enriched dietetic formulation in animal model.</a></h1><p>On the basis of preliminary in vitro experience, we assessed whether an enriched nutritional formulation with estrogen receptor (ER)-beta agonist and anti-inflammatory properties may prevent inflammation-associated colorectal  (CRC) in an animal model. Study sample enclosed 110 C57BL/6J male mice. Forty underwent dietary supplement safety assessment (20 standard diet and 20 enriched formulation). Seventy were treated with azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium and divided into two groups: 35 received standard diet and 35 enriched formulation (curcumin, boswellic acids, silymarin and maltodextrins). Miniature colonoscopy demonstrated colitis and solid lesion development in five mice/group 100 days after first AOM injection. Mice were killed after 10 days. In each group, four subgroups received intraperitoneal bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) injection at 24th/48th/72nd/96th hour before killing. Anti-inflammatory effect and chemoprevention were evaluated by lesion number/size, histological inflammation/dysplasia/neoplasia assessment, pro-inflammatory cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA), ER-beta/ER-alpha/BrdU immunohistochemistry and TUNEL immunofluorescence. Standard formulation assumption was associated with  shortening compared with enriched one (P = 0.04), which reduced solid lesion number and size (P < 0.001 for both), histological inflammation score (P = 0.04), pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression (P < 0.001), number of low-grade dysplasia (LGD; P = 0.03) and high-grade dysplasia (P < 0.001) areas. CRC was observed in 69.6% in standard and 23.5% in enriched formulation assuming animals (P < 0.001). Enriched formulation induced lower ER-alpha expression in CRC (P < 0.001) and higher ER-beta expression in LGD (P < 0.001) being associated to higher epithelial turnover (BrdU; P<0.001) in normal mucosa and increased apoptosis in LGD and CRC (P < 0.001 for both). Our results are promising for a successful anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive effect of enriched formulation in CRC arising from inflamed tissue.</p></html>
