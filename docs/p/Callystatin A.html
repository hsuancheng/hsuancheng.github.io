This protocol employs a sequential Wadsworth-Emmons reaction using a GAPPS reagent followed by alkylation of an allylic sulfone anion, and finally ligand-mediated, palladium-catalyzed desulfonylation.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12298019>Asymmetric total synthesis of (-)- and (-)-20-epi- employing chemical and biological methods.</a></h2><p>An efficient asymmetric total synthesis of the potent cytotoxic marine natural product (-)- and its 20-epi analogue has been achieved. The synthetic pathway involved the preparation of three fragments to be coupled with each other at the end of the route. The first fragment 3 was obtained using a biocatalytic enantioselective reduction of a 3,5-dioxocarboxylate as the key step. For the second intermediate 4 the asymmetric alpha-alkylation of an O-protected derivative of 4-hydroxybutanal was performed exploiting the SAMP/RAMP hydrazone alkylation methodology, and followed by a highly Z-selective Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction under modified conditions. For the synthesis of the polypropionate fragment 5 a diastereoselective syn-aldol reaction was employed between a chiral ethyl ketone and an alpha-substituted chiral aldehyde, both prepared in enantiopure form again by means of the asymmetric alkylation of their corresponding RAMP hydrazones. Finally, these three building blocks were coupled using highly E-selective Wittig reactions via allyltributylphosphonium ylides to afford the target compounds after a final oxidation/deprotection sequence.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12270151>New Rev-transport inhibitor with anti-HIV activity from Valerianae Radix.</a></h2><p>Bioassay-guided separation by use of the fission yeast expressing NES of Rev, a HIV-1 viral regulatory protein, resulted in isolation of valtrate (1) as a new Rev-transport inhibitor from the nucleus to cytoplasm from Valerianae Radix. Valtrate (1) also inhibited the p-24 production of HIV-1 virus without showing any cytotoxicity against the host MT-4 cells.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11893212>Asymmetric total synthesis of (-)- employing the SAMP/RAMP hydrazone alkylation methodology.</a></h2><p>[structure: see text] The asymmetric total synthesis of (-)- has been achieved. The key steps generating the stereogenic centers rely on the asymmetric alpha-alkylation of aldehydes or ketones exploiting the SAMP/RAMP hydrazone alkylation methodology, as well as an enzymatic enantioselective reduction of a 3,5-dioxocarboxylate. For the construction of the alkene moieties, highly selective Wittig or Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reactions were employed.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p></html>
