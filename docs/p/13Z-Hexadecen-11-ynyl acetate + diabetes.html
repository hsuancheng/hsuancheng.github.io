<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537625>In vitro profiling of volatile organic compounds released by Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Breath analysis offers a non-invasive and rapid diagnostic method for detecting various volatile organic compounds that could be indicators for different diseases, particularly metabolic disorders including type 2 . The development of type 2  is closely linked to metabolic dysfunction of adipose tissue and adipocytes. However, the VOC profile of human adipocytes has not yet been investigated. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection and head-space needle trap extraction (two-bed Carbopack X/Carboxen 1000 needle traps) were applied to profile VOCs produced and metabolised by human Simpson Golabi Behmel Syndrome adipocytes. In total, sixteen compounds were identified to be related to the metabolism of the cells. Four sulphur compounds (carbon disulphide, dimethyl sulphide, ethyl methyl sulphide and dimethyl disulphide), three heterocyclic compounds (2-ethylfuran, 2-methyl-5-(methyl-thio)-furan, and 2-pentylfuran), two ketones (acetone and 2-pentanone), two hydrocarbons (isoprene and n-heptane) and one ester (ethyl ) were produced, and four aldehydes (2-methyl-propanal, butanal, pentanal and hexanal) were found to be consumed by the cells of interest. This study presents the first profile of VOCs formed by human adipocytes, which may reflect the activity of the adipose tissue enzymes and provide evidence of their active role in metabolic regulation. Our data also suggest that a previously reported increase of isoprene and sulphur compounds in diabetic patients may be explained by their production by adipocytes. Moreover, the unique features of this profile, including a high emission of dimethyl sulphide and the production of furan-containing VOCs, increase our knowledge about metabolism in adipose tissue and provide diagnostic potential for future applications.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Here, heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp 90, adiponectin, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, Hsp32) are profiled in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum from 25 T2DM patients and 25 healthy control subjects. Cells cultured with phorbol 12-myristate 13-/ionomycin were evaluated by three-color flow cytometry for immunophenotypic biomarkers. Plasma HO-1, Hsp, and adiponectin levels were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Relative to healthy controls, T2DM patients exhibited significantly elevated plasma Hsp70, and representation of T helper immunophenotypes activated to express inflammatory cytokines, including CD4+ IFN-γ+, CD4+ TNF-α+, CD4+ IL-6+, CD4+ IL-1β+ T cells, significantly lower representation of CD4+ IL-10+ T cells, plasma adiponectin and cell-associated HO-1 expression-with no significant differences in plasma Hsp90 between T2DM and healthy controls. Plasma HO-1 and adiponectin in T2DM patients inversely correlated with TNF-α and showed inverse correlation between serum LDL and plasma HO-1. Moreover, TNF-α and Hsp90 in T2DM patients correlated positively with fasting blood glucose (FBG). These results demonstrate correlation between potentially pathogenic T cells, HO-1, and adiponectin, additionally revealing a T helper (Th)1-related character of T2DM immunopathogenesis, suggesting potential for novel T cell-related management strategies for T2DM and related co-morbidities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546691>Iso-Mukaadial  from  Enhances Glucose Uptake in the L6 Rat Myoblast Cell Line.</a></h2><p> (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder which has become a major risk to the health of humankind, as its global prevalence is increasing rapidly. Currently available treatment options in modern medicine have several adverse effects. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop alternative cost-effective, safe, and active treatments for . In this regard, medicinal plants provide the best option for new therapeutic remedies desired to be effective and safe. Recently, we focused our attention on drimane sesquiterpenes as potential sources of antimalarial and antidiabetic agents. In this study, iso-mukaadial  (Iso) (), a drimane-type sesquiterpenoid from the ground stem bark of , was investigated for glucose uptake enhancement in the L6 rat myoblast cell line. In vitro assays with L6 skeletal muscle cells were used to test for cytotoxicity, glucose utilisation, and western blot analysis. Additionally, the inhibition of carbohydrate digestive enzymes and 1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity were analysed in vitro. The cell viability effect of iso-mukaadial  was the highest at 3 µg/mL with a percentage of 98.4. Iso-mukaadial  also significantly and dose-dependently increased glucose utilisation up to 215.18% (12.5 µg/mL). The increase in glucose utilisation was accompanied by enhanced 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)and protein kinase B (AKT) in dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, iso-mukaadial  dose-dependently inhibited the enzymes α-amylase and α-glucosidase. Scavenging activity against DPPH was displayed by iso-mukaadial  in a concentration-dependent manner. The findings indicate the apparent therapeutic efficacy of iso-mukaadial  isolated from  as a potential new antidiabetic agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31151640>Molecular and technical aspects on the interaction of serum albumin with multifunctional food preservatives.</a></h2><p>Synthetic food preservatives like sodium  (SA), sodium benzoate (SB), potassium sorbate (PS) and Butyl paraben (BP) have been widely used in food and pharmacy industries. One of the toxicological aspects of food additives is evaluation of their interaction with serum proteins such as albumin. These additives interaction with human serum albumin (HSA) can exert considerable effect on the absorption, distribution, metabolism and toxicity of chemical compounds. It should be noticed that the aforementioned food preservatives intake increase mainly in the presence of glucose may lead to complex formation of SA, SB, PS and BP with HSA and accelerate the development of variety disease such as cancer, , multiple sclerosis, brain damage, nausea and cardiac disease. Therefore, to understand the mechanisms of aforementioned food additives interaction and conformational changes of proteins, we aim to review various studies that investigated albumin interaction with these additives using several procedures.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, we compared the effects of diets varying in inulin concentrations on food intake, energy expenditure, body composition, gut microbiota and hormones, and assessed whether inulin-induced hypophagia was due to reduced diet preference. In experiment 1, male rats were randomized to six high-fat diet groups: control (CON, 0% inulin), 2.5% inulin (2.5IN), 10% inulin (10IN), 25% inulin (25IN), 25% cellulose (25CE) or pair-fed to 25IN (25PF) for 21 days. We demonstrate that inulin dose-dependently decreased caloric intake and respiratory quotient; improved glucose tolerance; increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Bifidobacterium spp.; decreased Clostridium clusters I and IV; increased butyryl-CoA: CoA-transferase in cecum; upregulated peptide YY, cholecystokinin and proglucagon transcripts in the cecum and colon; and increased plasma peptide YY and glucagon-like peptide-1 concentrations. Importantly, unlike 25PF, 25IN attenuated the reduction in energy expenditure associated with calorie restriction and decreased adiposity. In experiment 2, following four training periods, diet preferences were determined. Although 10IN and 25IN decreased caloric intake, and 25CE increased caloric intake, during training, all high-fiber diets were less preferred. Taken together, this work demonstrates that inulin dose-dependently decreased caloric intake, modulated gut microbiota and upregulated satiety hormones, with metabolic effects being largely independent of caloric restriction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to measure the risk-benefit ratio of this treatment.Twenty patients with well-controlled  were included in a prospective study. In a first preinjection phase, patients were asked to measure glycemia for 7 days, before breakfast and dinner, and then 2 hours after lunch and dinner. Baseline data including Constant Score (CS), Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV), and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain were collected. Patients were treated with subacromial injection with 40 mg of Methylprednisolone  and 2 ml of Lidocaine. At discharge, patients were asked to remeasure glycemia for the following week.The overall pain improved and patients graded their shoulder as "greatly improved". At 30-day follow-up, the SSV and the CS improved, considering pain but not ROM. The average daily glycemia was 136 mg/dl before injection, 161 mg/dl the day of the injection (p<0.001), and 170 mg/dl one day after injection (p<0.001). Glycemia was not statistically different 3 days after injection.Subacromial injection is an effective short-term treatment in type 2 diabetic patients affected by shoulder pain, but a closed follow-up is recommended in all these patients.

Here, a high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection method was developed to simultaneously determine nine monoamines and amino acids including three excitatory neurotransmitters (aspartate, glutamate, and serotonin), four inhibitory neurotransmitters (glycine, γ-aminobutyric acid, taurine, dopamine), a precursor of 5-HT (tryptophan) and methionine using homoserine as the internal standard. The separation was performed on a BDS column with methanol-buffer solution of 35 mmol/L sodium  and 5 mmol/L citric acid (pH 6.0) using a simple gradient elution. Several parameters including specificity, precision, and recovery were validated after optimization of the analytical conditions.

An in-depth understanding of metabolic alterations in the brain associated with DM will facilitate our understanding of the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction. The present study used an  culture of primary neurons in a high-glucose (HG) environment to investigate characteristic alterations in neuron metabolism using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was also used to measure changes in the adenosine phosphate levels in the hippocampal regions of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Our results revealed significant elevations in phosphocholine and ATP production in neurons and decreased formate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), tyrosine, methionine,  and phenylalanine levels after HG treatment. However, the significant changes in lactate, glutamate, taurine and myo-inositol levels in astrocytes we defined previously in astrocytes, were not found in neurons, suggested cell-specific metabolic alterations. We also confirmed an astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle between different compartments in the brain under HG conditions, which was accompanied by abnormal  transport. These alterations reveal specific information on the metabolite levels and transport processes related to neurons under diabetic conditions.

Herein we report a novel high throughput "sample-in-answer-out" integrated platform for continuous leukocyte sorting and single-cell electrical profiling in a label-free manner. The multi-staged platform enables isolation of neutrophils and monocytes from diluted or lysed blood samples directly within minutes based on Dean flow fractionation (DFF) (stage 1). Next DFF-purified leukocytes are inertially focused in serpentine channels into a single stream (stage 2) prior to impedance detection (stage 3). As a proof-of-concept for neutrophil functional characterization towards  testing, we characterized the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis) of healthy and glucose-treated neutrophils and observed significant changes in dielectric properties (size and opacity) between both groups. Interestingly, the NETosis profiles induced by calcium ionophore (CaI) and phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) were also electrically different, which could be attributed to the differential rates of cell enlargement and attenuated membrane permeability.

Taub. is an ethnomedicinal tree of remedial value in the treatment of , bone fractures, and liver and neurological disorders. However, the information available on DNA-protective and anti-proliferative potential of bark of this tree is scarce. In the present study, the extract/fractions obtained from bark of B. monosperma were evaluated for antioxidant, DNA-protective, and anti-proliferative activities, along with their phytochemical profiling for identifying major constituents present in them. Different extract/fractions, namely, Bmth (methanol), Bhex (hexane), Bchl (chloroform), and Beac (ethyl ), were prepared and evaluated for antioxidant activity using in vitro assays. Extract/fractions were also evaluated for anti-proliferative and apoptotic activity in human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, using in vitro assays, namely, MTT, clonogenic, and neutral comet assay, along with confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Among all extract/fractions, a pronounced antioxidant activity was exhibited by Bchl and Beac fractions, in DPPH· (EC 213.2 and 161.5 µg/mL, respectively), ABTS· (EC 139.3 and 44.1 µg/mL, respectively), and reducing power assay (EC 86.7 and 84.5 µg/mL, respectively). Both fractions protected plasmid DNA against hydroxyl radical induced damage in plasmid nicking assay. Bchl and Beac were also observed to inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells (GI 203.7 and 246.5 µg/mL, respectively). Both fractions induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, by arresting the cell cycle in G1 and sub-G1 phase, respectively, enhancing ROS levels, decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential, and inducing double-strand DNA breaks.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are associated with a greater risk of . However, the role of GnRH in diabetic wound healing is unclear. We determined whether GnRH-promoted NETosis and induced more severe and delayed diabetic wound healing. A mouse model of  was established using five injections with streptozotocin. Mice with blood glucose levels >250 mg/dL were then used in the experiments. GnRH agonist treatment induced delayed wound healing and increased NETosis at the skin wounds of diabetic mice. In contrast, GnRH antagonist treatment inhibited GnRH agonist-induced delayed wound healing. The expression of NETosis markers PAD4 and citrullinated histone H3 were increased in the GnRH-treated diabetic skin wounds in diabetic mice and patients. In vitro experiments also showed that neutrophils expressed a GnRH receptor and that GnRH agonist treatment increased NETosis markers and promoted phorbol myristate  (PMA)-induced NETosis in mouse and human neutrophils. Furthermore, GnRH antagonist treatment suppressed the expression of NETosis markers and PMA-induced NETosis, which were increased by GnRH treatment. These results indicated that GnRH-promoted NETosis and that increased NETosis induced delayed wound healing in diabetic skin wounds. Thus, inhibition of GnRH might be a novel treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29933236>Serum polyfluoroalkyl chemicals are associated with risk of cardiovascular diseases in national US population.</a></h2><p>Perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs) as possible cardiovascular disrupters are universally detected in humans. However, evidence from epidemiological studies appears insufficient and ambiguous.We aim to examine the serum PFCs levels and their associations with the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related outcomes in general US population.We investigated the serum levels of 12 major PFCs, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), 2-(N-ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido)  (EPAH), 2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido)  (MPAH), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDE), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHP), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFSA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUA), and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDO), in 10,859 participants from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2014. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between serum PFCs and 5 self-reported CVD outcomes, including congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, heart attack, and stroke. Linear regression analyses were used to estimate the PFCs and their associations with 8 traditional CVD risk factors like serum triglyceride and total cholesterol.In multivariable-adjusted models, total PFCs were positively associated with total CVD (p for trend = 0.0166), independent of traditional CVD risk factors, such as smoking status, , hypertension and serum cholesterol level. Compared with reference quartile of total PFCs levels, the multivariable adjusted odds ratios in increasing quartiles were 1.23 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91-1.66], 1.47 (95% CI: 1.14-1.89) and 1.45 (95% CI: 1.06-1.98) for total CVD. Similar positive associations were found if considering individual PFCs including PFOS, PFUA, MPAH, EPAH, PFDO, PFSA and PFBS. In addition, serum levels of MPAH and PFDO were positively associated with congestive heart failure; PFNA, PFDE, and PFUA were positively associated with coronary heart disease; PFUA and PFDO were positively associated with angina pectoris; and PFNA was positively associated with heart attack.Our findings suggested that exposure to PFCs was positively associated with risk of CVD.

The aim of this study was to investigate in high fat diet-induced obese male rats the effects of GbE supplementation for 2 weeks on adipocyte volume and adipose tissue lipid accumulation. GbE supplementation was effective in reducing energy intake in obese rats compared to the saline-treated placebo group. Epididymal adipocyte volume was reduced in GbE-supplemented rats, as were epididymal [1-C]- incorporation into fatty acids, perilipin () and fatty acid synthase () mRNA, and FAS protein levels. Adipocyte hypertrophy in obesity is associated with insulin resistance, and in the present study we observed a reduction in the adipocyte volume of GbE-supplemented obese rats to dimensions equivalent to adipocytes from non-obese rats. GbE supplementation significantly reduced  accumulation and tended to reduce [H]-oleate incorporation, into epididymal adipose tissue, suggesting a potentially anti-obesogenic effect in longer term therapies.

The antiandrogens are used for a variety of hyperandrogenic states such as acne, hirsutism, and paraphilias, but their major use is in therapy of prostate cancer. Chemically, antiandrogens are classified into steroidal (such as cyproterone ) and nonsteroidal (including flutamide, nilutamide and bicalutamide). Cyproterone, despite evaluation in many clinical trials, has yet to receive FDA approval for use the United States, largely because of its potential for hepatotoxicity. In contrast, flutamide, nilutamide and bicalutamide are now approved and in general clinical use for therapy of prostate cancer. The largest and longest clinical experience has been with flutamide which has been shown to produce clinical remission in patients with prostate cancer, and is also used in hyperandrogenic states including acne and hirsutism. Nilutamide has been extensively studied and is indicated for use in combination with surgical castration for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer and is recommended to be started at the time of orchiectomy. Unlike flutamide, nilutamide has not been evaluated in detail as therapy of hirsutism or acne. Bicalutamide, the most recent antiandrogen to be approved for use in the United States, is also used in therapy of prostate cancer, but has not been approved for use in nonmalignant hyperandrogenic states. All three nonsteroidal antiandrogens have been linked to instances of liver injury. Minor asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels occur in 10% to 62% of patients on long term antiandrogen therapy, and prominent elevations (3 to 5 times the ULN) in 1% to 10%, the rates being somewhat higher for flutamide than nilutamide or bicalutamide. Instances of acute hepatitis with jaundice and even acute liver failure have been reported with all three antiandrogens. While most reports have related to flutamide, this may be due to its more extensive use. The rate of clinically apparent acute liver injury during prolonged antiandrogen therapy is reported to be as high as 9%, but is probably in the range of 0.1% to 1%. Screening for serum aminotransferase levels during the first few months of therapy is often recommended, but the effectiveness of this approach in preventing serious liver injury and death has not been shown. Abiraterone is a more recently developed antiandrogen used to treat prostate cancer. Abiraterone is a steroid inhibitor of CYP17, an enzyme in the pathway of androgen production which has been shown to be effective in prolonging relapse free and overall survival in men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. Abiraterone has been linked to a moderate rate of serum aminotransferasae elevations during therapy, but the abnormalities are usually mild and transient, and instances of clinically apparent liver injury have not been linked to use of this agent, although its general use has been limited.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30561288>Gut microbiota and health: connecting actors across the metabolic system.</a></h2><p>Overweight-related metabolic diseases are an important threat to health in the Western world. Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for metabolic syndrome, CVD and type 2 . The human gut microbiota is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and metabolic health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human metabolism through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. , propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, lipid oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, endothelial function and gut barrier integrity, and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 , hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota is also involved in bile acid metabolism and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in metabolic health. Similarly, the gut microbiota renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce metabolic disease risk. This review summarises how dietary patterns, specific foods and a healthy lifestyle may modulate metabolic health through the gut microbiota and their molecular cross-talk with the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30303695>Elevation of the adiponectin/leptin ratio in women with gestational  after supplementation with alpha-lipoic acid.</a></h2><p>Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a short chain fatty acid and is known as a universal antioxidant.

The red propolis, collected in the northeast region of Brazil has been highlighted due to its popular use as an antimicrobial, with anti-inflammatory and healing properties, which are associated with its chemical composition. Here, we combine a bacterial membrane with red propolis to treat wounds of diabetic mice. This work aims to evaluate a biocurative from bacterial cellulose associated with red propolis in diabetic mice as wound healing model. Biocuratives from bacterial cellulose membrane and different extracts of red propolis were produced. The qualification and quantification of the presence of propolis chemical compounds in the membrane were investigated through high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Tests in vivo with biocuratives were performed on Swiss male diabetic mice induced by estroptozotocin. The animals were submitted to a surgical procedure and a single lesion was produced in the dorsal region, which was treated with the biocuratives. Macroscopic assessments were performed at 2, 7 and 14 postoperative days, and biopsies were collected on days 0, 7 and 14 for histological analysis, myeloperoxidase enzyme activity (MPO) and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and TGF-β). Altogether, ten compounds were identified in membranes and five were further quantified. The ethyl  extract showed more red propolis markers, and the most prevalent compound was Formononetin with 4423.00-2907.00 μg.g. Macroscopic analyses demonstrated that the two groups treated with red propolis (GMEBT and GMEAE) showed significantly greater healing capabilities compared to the control groups (GS and GMS). An increase in leukocyte recruitment was observed, confirmed by the activity of the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) in GMEBT and GMEAE groups. The levels of TNF-α were significantly higher in wounds stimulated with red propolis, as well as in TGF-β (GMEBT and GMEAE) on day 7. This was different from the IL-1β levels that were higher in the control groups (GS and GMS). In summary, the biocuratives produced in this work were able to accelerate the wound healing process in a diabetic mouse model. In this way, the traditional knowledge of red propolis activity helped to create a biotechnological product, which can be used for diabetic wound healing purpose.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone and urinary mineralocorticoid metabolites after 8 weeks were higher with prednisone, 2.5 mg, twice daily and 5 mg once daily than with 5 mg twice daily or dexamethasone, 0.5 mg, once daily. The level of urinary glucocorticoid metabolites appeared higher in patients who did not meet the primary end point, regardless of glucocorticoid regimen. Total lean body mass decreased in the prednisone groups and total body fat increased in the prednisone, 5 mg, twice daily and dexamethasone groups. In the dexamethasone group, there was an increase in serum insulin and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, while total bone mineral density decreased. In the prednisone, 5 mg, twice daily, 5 mg once daily, 2.5 mg twice daily, and dexamethasone groups, median radiographic progression-free survival was 18.5, 15.3, 12.8, and 26.6 months, respectively.Abiraterone  with prednisone, 5 mg, twice daily or dexamethasone, 0.5 mg, once daily met the prespecified threshold for the primary end point (95% CI excluded 50% mineralocorticoid excess); abiraterone  with prednisone, 5 mg, once daily or 2.5 mg twice daily did not meet the threshold.

We aimed here to develop a combined fixed-dose formulation of pramlintide with fast-acting insulin. We have investigated the compatibility of regular and fast-acting insulin analogues (Aspart, Asp, and LisPro, LysPro) with the amylin analogue pramlintide by using electrospray ionization - ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (ESI-IMS-MS), kinetic aggregation assays monitored by thioflavin T, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in the evaluation of the aggregation product. Insulin interacts with pramlintide, forming heterodimers as probed by ESI-IMS-MS. While their interaction is likely to delay the amyloid aggregation of pramlintide in phosphate-buffered solution pH 7.0, they do not prevent aggregation at this condition. At acidic sodium  solution pH 5.0, combination of pramlintide and the fast-acting insulin analogues become stable against amyloid aggregation. The co-formulated product at high concentration of both pramlintide (600 μg/mL,150 μM) and LisPro insulin (50 IU/mL, 300 μM) showed also stability against amyloid aggregation. These data indicate the physico-chemical short-term stability of the co-formulated preparation of LisPro insulin with pramlintide, which could bring benefits for the combined therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Bertoni besides being a source of noncaloric sweeteners is also an important source of bioactive molecules. Many plant extracts, mostly obtained with ethyl  solvent, are rich in polyphenol compounds that present insulinotropic effects. To investigate whether the nonsweetener fraction, which is rich in phenolic compounds isolated from  with the solvent ethyl  (EAF), has an insulinotropic effect, including interference at the terminals of the autonomic nervous system of the pancreatic islets of rats. Pancreatic islets were isolated from Wistar rats and incubated with EAF and inhibitory or stimulatory substances of insulin secretion, including cholinergic and adrenergic agonists and antagonists. EAF potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) only in the presence of high glucose and calcium-dependent concentrations. EAF increased muscarinic insulinotropic effects in pancreatic islets, interfering with the muscarinic receptor subfamily M. Adrenergic inhibitory effects on GSIS were attenuated in the presence of EAF, which interfered with the adrenergic  receptor.

Dietary fibers are non-digestible polysaccharides that are composed of complex carbohydrates. Based on their relative solubility in water, dietary fibers can be divided into insoluble and soluble forms. An important property of insoluble fibers is their ability to bind with carcinogens, mutagens, and other toxic chemicals that are formed during digestion of food and eliminate them through the feces. Soluble fibers can often be degraded to short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, propionate, and  by microbial fermentation. This review discusses mechanisms of action of fibers and their beneficial effects on the GI tract as well as on other organs. Among short-chain fatty acids, butyrate has been most extensively studied and the effects of sodium butyrate on cell culture and animal models are discussed in order to emphasize its potential value in prevention of certain diseases.Copyright © 2018.

The production of extracellular traps by activated leukocytes in response to a range of inflammatory stimuli is increasingly recognised as an important process within a range of disease settings. We show that exposure of human monocyte-derived macrophages to pathophysiological levels of HOCl results in the dose-dependent extrusion of DNA and histones into the cellular supernatant, consistent with extracellular trap formation. Concurrent with, but independent of these findings, macrophage exposure to HOCl also resulted in an immediate and sustained cytosolic accumulation of Ca, culminating in the increased production of cytokines and chemokines. Polarisation of the macrophages prior to HOCl exposure revealed a greater propensity for inflammatory M1 macrophages to produce extracellular traps, whereas alternatively-activated M2 macrophages were less susceptible to HOCl insult. M1 macrophages also produced extracellular traps on exposure to phorbol myristate  (PMA), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα). Taken together, these data indicate a potential role for macrophages in mediating extracellular trap formation, which may be relevant in pathological conditions characterised by chronic inflammation or excessive HOCl formation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

"Arterialized" venous blood and breath samples were collected over 3 hours for measurements of plasma glucose, GLP-1, insulin and glucagon, and GE, respectively.Compared with control, both proximal and distal metformin reduced plasma glucose and augmented GLP-1 responses to oral glucose comparably (P < 0.05 each), without affecting plasma insulin or glucagon. GE was slower after proximal metformin than after control (P < 0.05) and tended to be slower after distal metformin, without any difference between proximal and distal metformin.In diet-controlled T2DM patients, glucose-lowering via a single dose of metformin administered to the upper and lower gut was comparable and was associated with stimulation of GLP-1 and slowing of GE. These observations suggest that the site of gastrointestinal administration is not critical to the glucose-lowering capacity of metformin.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921227>Adrenocortical hypofunction with simultaneous primary aldosteronism: A case report.</a></h2><p>Cases of adrenocortical hyperfunction combined with primary aldosteronism have been reported in the literature, and the underlying mechanism involves the secretion of aldosterone and glucocorticoids by a tumor or an adenoma. However, adrenocortical hypofunction and coexisting primary aldosteronism have not been reported until now. Herein, we report a case of adrenocortical hypofunction combined with primary aldosteronism.A 66-year-old Chinese woman with rheumatoid arthritis who had been diagnosed with secondary adrenal insufficiency and was taking prednisone  tablets for replacement treatment presented to our department. She also had type 2 , osteoporosis, bilateral knee osteoarthritis, and lumbar vertebral compression fracture. She had previously developed tuberculosis, which had been cured.The cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone rhythm indicated cortisol dysfunction in the patient. A 64-slice computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging both showed bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. A postural stimulation test indicated a high level of aldosteronism and a high aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR, supine position: aldosterone 1788.73 pg/mL, ARR 146.62; upright position: aldosterone 2916.21 pg/mL, ARR 92.29). The captopril test showed the aldosterone level decreased by 364.70 pg/mL 1 hour after administration of captopril (from 2153.28 to 1788.58 pg/mL). The decline in aldosterone level was approximately 16.90% (i.e., <30%), and the ARR was still >40. Based on the above-mentioned findings, we diagnosed the patient with adrenocortical hypofunction with primary aldosteronism.We administered spironolactone 20 mg twice daily and continued the glucocorticoid replacement therapy.One week after diagnosis, the patient had an aldosterone level of 2201.16 pg/mL, plasma renin activity of 3.88 ng/mL/h, and an ARR of 56.7 (upright position). Her blood pressure was maintained within the normal range.Although adrenocortical hypofunction with primary aldosteronism is rare, cases of primary aldosteronism complicated with hypercortisolism are occasionally encountered. Hence, whenever possible, we recommend testing both aldosterone and cortisol levels in all patients with adrenal dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29914670>Supplementation of oat (Avena sativa L.) extract abates alcohol-induced acute liver injury in a mouse model.</a></h2><p>Dietary supplementation of oats has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, , and gastrointestinal disorders. The role of oat extract as prophylactic in treating acute liver injury is not thoroughly established. We, therefore, hypothesized that oat extract would exert protective effect against alcohol-induced acute liver injury in a mouse model. To test this hypothesis, male C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with phenolic-enriched ethyl  (EA) fraction of oats (prepared by fractionating aqueous ethanolic extract with solvents of increasing polarity) at dosages of 125 and 250 mg kg d for 12 consecutive days. Acute liver injury was induced by administering 5 doses of 50% ethanol intragastrically (10 g/kg body weight) to mice at an interval of 12 hours. The alcohol-induced liver injury was evaluated by measuring serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, antioxidant parameters, mitochondrial function, and histology of liver tissue. Our results demonstrated that pretreatment with EA fraction at 250 mg kg d significantly (P < .001 for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive species and P < .01 for lactate dehydrogenase and nitrites) reduced the levels of liver injury markers and significantly (P < .001 for glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase; P < .01 for catalase, superoxide dismustase, and vitamin C; P < .05 for reduced glutathione and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1) increased the levels of antioxidant defenses. Furthermore, EA-pretreated mice showed mechanistic inhibition of nuclear factor κB signaling pathway through decreased phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. We conclude that phenolic-enriched EA fraction of oats has immense potential to serve as dietary intervention against alcohol-induced liver damage.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Hence, microbiome modulators such as probiotics may be helpful in maintaining or even restoring normal gut microbiome composition to benefit host health. Herein, we developed a human-origin probiotic cocktail with the ability to modulate gut microbiota to increase native SCFA production. Following a robust protocol of isolation, characterization and safety validation of infant gut-origin Lactobacillus and Enterococcus strains with probiotic attributes (tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions, adherence to intestinal epithelial cells, absence of potential virulence genes, cell-surface hydrophobicity, and susceptibility to common antibiotics), we select 10 strains (5 from each genera) out of total 321 isolates. A single dose (oral gavage) as well as 5 consecutive doses of this 10-strain probiotic cocktail in mice modulates gut microbiome and increases SCFA production (particularly propionate and butyrate). Inoculation of these probiotics in human feces also increases SCFA production along with microbiome modulation. Results indicate that human-origin probiotic lactobacilli and enterococci could ameliorate gut microbiome dysbiosis and hence may prove to be a potential therapy for diseases involving reduced SCFAs production in the gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31356781>Propionate suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis via GPR43/AMPK signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as , propionate, and butyrate are generated by gut microbial fermentation of dietary fiber. SCFAs may exert multiple beneficial effects on human lipid and glucose metabolism. However, their actions and underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. In this study, we examined the direct effects of propionate on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism using human HepG2 hepatocytes. Here, we demonstrate that propionate at a physiologically-relevant concentration effectively suppresses palmitate-enhanced glucose production in HepG2 cells but does not affect intracellular neutral lipid levels. Our results indicated that propionate can decline in gluconeogenesis by down-regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a major regulator of the hepatic glucose metabolism. Mechanistic studies also revealed that propionate-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation can be ascribed to Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) activation in response to an increase in intracellular Ca concentration. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the propionate receptor GPR43 prevented propionate-inducible activation of AMPK and abrogates the gluconeogenesis-inhibitory action. Thus, our data indicate that the binding of propionate to hepatic GPR43 elicits CaMKKβ-dependent activation of AMPK through intracellular Ca increase, leading to suppression of gluconeogenesis.

NADPH oxidase-derived O2- can inactivate nitric oxide and induce vascular injury.The crude ethanolic extract of Lysimachia christinae Hance were separated out 4 fractions of different olarities by petroleum ether, ethyl , n-butanol (NB), and aqueous. The endothelial integrity was appraised by vascular tension measurement. Dihydroethidium was utilized to observe the vascular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Western-blot was adopted to detect protein expression.Among the 4 fractions of L. christinae Hance, the NB fraction showed the most potent capacity of promoting endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation and inhibiting ROS formation in aortic rings, which were likely attributed by suppressing the expression of NAD(P)H oxidase subunit (gp91phox, p47phox, and p67phox) and enhancing the phosphorylation of endothelial NOS in vascular tone.These results suggest that the NB fraction possess the strongest vascular pharmacological activities among the crude ethanolic extract of L. christinae Hance, which may help us for purifying bioactive constituents and discovering new drugs from this herb in future.© 2019 S.

We investigated the effect of the ethyl  fraction (QCL) of Cortex Lycii on the enzymes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrate in diabetic rat models. Streptozotocin-nicotinamide (110 and 65mg/kg body weight, respectively) was used to induce . Diabetic rats were treated with QCL (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) and glibenclamide (600 μg/kg) daily for six weeks. Upon the completion of treatment, fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), haemoglobin (Hb), hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase levels were measured by biochemical assays. Likewise, the body weight, food and water intake was monitored and measured. Diabetic rats displayed significant elevation in the blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and a marked decrease in plasma insulin and hemoglobin. Furthermore, the levels of key enzymes including fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase were significantly increased while the activity levels of hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycogen were significantly down regulated in diabetic rats. However, treatment of diabetic rats with Cortex Lycii led to a significant reduction the FGB, food and water intake and an increase in the plasma insulin level. Treatment with Cortex Lycii also reversed the altered activity profiles of the key enzymes mentioned above in a dose dependent manner. Our results suggested that Cortex Lycii has a promising therapeutic option in the management of diabetic complications relating to glucose homeostasis and carbohydrate metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30609575>Simultaneous determination of alpha-, beta- and gamma-hydroxybutyric acids in micro-pulverized human hair by GC-MS: Method development, validation and application.</a></h2><p>An analytical method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of alpha, beta and gamma-hydroxybutyric acids (AHB, BHB and GHB, respectively) in human hair. Hair samples (10 mg) were pulverized and submitted to extraction using methanol (1 mL) for 10 min. The extract was centrifuged, filtered, and evaporated to dryness at 40 °C under a gentle N flow, dissolved in ethyl  (0.050 mL) and derivatized using 0.050 mL of BSTFA containing 1% TMCS, at °C for 40 min. The derivatives were determined by GC/MS. Aliquots of natural hair ("blank") samples after water extraction (3 steps) were pulverized, spiked with AHB, BHB, GHB or d-GHB and used for method validation. Figures of merit showed the method's feasibility. The LOQ values were 1 ng mg for BHB and AHB and 0.6 ng mg for GHB, and mean recoveries were 54%, 69% and 75% for AHB, BHB and GHB respectively. Precision and bias were better than 15% and 20% respectively. Calibration curves (LOQ to 20 ng mg for AHB and BHB and LOQ to 16 ng mg for GHB) obtained in 5 days were pooled for statistical analysis, but the data were heteroscedastic, as demonstrated by the White test. Therefore, weighted linear regression and data transformations were applied and the best results were obtained using the Box-Cox transformation [c' = (c-1)/λ] for GHB and log transformation for AHB and BHB. Authentic hair samples were collected from the posterior head vertex of 23 volunteers (16 females and 7 males). Four of them declared having type-2  (T2D). Only female volunteers reported hair treatments such as dyeing, flat ironing, straightening and/or bleaching. Dyeing appeared not to affect GHB levels in hair, but no data were found in the literature about other cosmetic treatments. GHB levels varied from < LOQ to 1.5 ng mg. BHB levels varied from < LOQ to 3.4 ng mg and from < LOQ to 1.8 ng mg in non-diabetic volunteers with or without family history of T2D, respectively. However, in diabetics, BHB levels varied from 3.4 to 5.2 ng mg. The levels of AHB varied from < LOQ to 1.2 ng mg in non-diabetic individuals, and from 1.1 to 6.2 ng mg in diabetics. Our results showed that AHB levels in hair have potential to as a biomarker for T2D, but this needs to be further studied with larger groups of volunteers. To our knowledge, this is the first published method for the determination of AHB and BHB in human hair.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, two advanced bioactivity-profiling techniques, i.e., ligand fishing and high-resolution inhibition profiling, have shown great promises for accelerating identification of α-glucosidase inhibitors from complex plant extracts. Non-specific affinities and non-specific inhibitions are major sources of false positive hits from ligand fishing and high-resolution inhibition profiling, respectively. In an attempt to minimize such false positive hits, we describe a new screening approach based on ligand fishing and high-resolution inhibition profiling for detection of high-affinity ligands and assessment of inhibitory activity, respectively. The complementary nature of ligand fishing and high-resolution inhibition profiling was explored to identify α-glucosidase inhibitory ligands from a complex mixture, and proof-of-concept was demonstrated with crude ethyl  extract of Ginkgo biloba. In addition to magnetic beads with a 3-carbon aliphatic linker, α-glucosidase was immobilized on magnetic beads with a 21-carbon aliphatic linker; and the two different types of magnetic beads were compared for their hydrolytic activity and fishing efficiency.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the effect of glyburide on Ca movement and its related cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells is unclear. This study examined whether glyburide altered Ca signalling and viability in PC3 human prostate cancer cells and investigated those underlying mechanisms. Intracellular Ca concentrations ([Ca ] ) in suspended cells were measured by using the fluorescent Ca -sensitive dye fura-2. Cell viability was examined by WST-1 assay. Glyburide at concentrations of 100-1000 μM induced [Ca ] rises. Ca removal reduced the signal by approximately 60%. In Ca -containing medium, glyburide-induced Ca entry was inhibited by 60% by protein kinase C (PKC) activator (phorbol 12-myristate 13 , PMA) and inhibitor (GF109203X), and modulators of store-operated Ca channels (nifedipine, econazole and SKF96365). Furthermore, glyburide induced Mn influx suggesting of Ca entry. In Ca -free medium, inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122 significantly inhibited glyburide-induced [Ca ] rises. Treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca pump inhibitor 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) abolished glyburide-evoked [Ca ] rises. Conversely, treatment with glyburide abolished BHQ-evoked [Ca ] rises. Glyburide at 100-500 μM decreased cell viability, which was not reversed by pretreatment with the Ca chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM). Together, in PC3 cells, glyburide induced [Ca ] rises by Ca entry via PKC-sensitive store-operated Ca channels and Ca release from the ER in a PLC-dependent manner. Glyburide also caused Ca -independent cell death.

In addition to regulating glucose metabolism, they also alter lipid metabolism. Due to the clear association between  and atherosclerosis, the purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of sodium orthovanadate on the amount of individual fatty acids and the expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD or Δ-desaturase), Δ-desaturase, and Δ-desaturase in macrophages. THP-1 macrophages differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) were incubated in vitro for 48 h with 1 μM or 10 μM sodium orthovanadate (NaVO). The estimation of fatty acid composition was performed by gas chromatography. Expressions of the genes SCD, fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1), and fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) were tested by qRT-PCR. Sodium orthovanadate in THP-1 macrophages increased the amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) such as palmitic acid and stearic acid, as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)-oleic acid and palmitoleic acid. Sodium orthovanadate caused an upregulation of SCD expression. Sodium orthovanadate at the given concentrations did not affect the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In conclusion, sodium orthovanadate changed SFA and MUFA composition in THP-1 macrophages and increased expression of SCD. Sodium orthovanadate did not affect the amount of any PUFA.

In pregnancy, the maternal gut microbiome has associations with maternal and infant metabolic status. There is little known regarding the impact of a vegetarian diet in pregnancy on maternal gut microbiota. This study explored the gut microbiota profile in women who were vegetarian or omnivorous in early gestation. Women were selected from participants in the Study of PRobiotics IN Gestational  (SPRING) randomised controlled trial. Nine women identified as vegetarians were matched to omnivorous women in a 1:2 ratio. Microbiota analyses were performed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and analysed using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) and Calypso software tools. There was no difference in alpha diversity, but beta diversity was slightly reduced in vegetarians. There were differences seen in the relative abundance of several genera in those on a vegetarian diet, specifically a reduction in , , and increases in the relative abundances of  and .

Various serum parameters, blood cell parameters and oxidative stress induced parameters of the liver and kidneys were investigated.Results showed that aqueous fraction of F. olivieri (FOAE) potentially inhibited activity of pancreatic α-amylase, intestinal maltase and sucrase. Administration of FOAE (200 mg/kg; 400 mg/kg) to diabetic rats for 21 days increased body weight, hemoglobin and its indices, RBCs, platelets, lymphocytes and neutrophils against diabetic group. In serum level of glucose, transaminases, ALP, LDH, total bilirubin, creatinine and lipids decreased while insulin, total protein and albumin increased in contrast to diabetic group. Further, level of cytokines; TGF-β1, TNF-α and IL-6 in serum and altered level of antioxidant enzymes, glutathione and lipid peroxides of liver and kidney tissues restored towards control animals.This study demonstrated that FOAE inhibited activity of digestive enzymes and exhibited antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antihyperglycemic activity in STZ-nicotinamide prompted diabetic rats and suggested that FOAE might be used as a therapeutic agent for the management of type-2 .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

There is increasing evidence that sustained brain inflammation may account for this long-term prejudicial outcome in diabetic patients in particular. We sought to demonstrate that experimental permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo) in the diabetic mouse aggravates stroke, induces cognitive decline, and is associated with exacerbated brain inflammation, and that these effects can be alleviated and/or prevented by the immunomodulator, glatiramer  (GA). Male diabetic C57Bl6 mice (streptozotocin IP) subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo), were treated by the immunomodulator, GA (Copaxone®) (1 mg/kg daily, sc) until 3 or 7 days post stroke. Infarct volume, brain pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, microglial/macrophage density, and neurogenesis were monitored during the first week post stroke. Neurological sensorimotor deficit, spatial memory and brain deposits of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were assessed until six weeks post stroke. In diabetic mice with pMCAo, proinflammatory mediators (IL-1β, MCP1, TNFα and CD68) were significantly higher than in non-diabetic mice. In GA-treated mice, the infarct volume was reduced by 30% at D3 and by 40% at D7 post stroke (P < 0.05), sensorimotor recovery was accelerated as early as D3, and long-term memory loss was prevented. Moreover, proinflammatory mediators significantly decreased between D3 (COX2) and D7 (CD32, TNFα, IL-1β), and neurogenesis was significantly increased at D7. Moreover, GA abrogates the accumulation of insoluble Aβ40. This work is the first one to evidence that the immunomodulatory drug GA reduces infarct volume and proinflammatory mediators, enhances early neurogenesis, accelerates sensorimotor recovery, and prevents long-term memory loss in diabetic mice with pMCAo.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The rats were divided into normal control, diabetic control (DC), standard, sham, and test groups. The test groups were treated with an oral dose of 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg of crude, aqueous, and ethyl  partition of S. persica extract. After 21 days of experiment, the fasting blood glucose (FBS), LPs, lipid peroxidation, IS, liver enzymes levels, liver histopathology, and body weight alteration were evaluated. A significant decrease in FBS and lipid profile (except HDL) were observed in rats treated with various dose of extract compared with the DC rats ( P < 0.05). Treating diabetic rats with various extracts of S. persica meaningfully decreased the level of malondialdehyde ( P < 0.05). Animals treated with various dose of aqueous extract showed better results ( P < 0.01). On the basis of used indirect indexes to determine IS, all partitions of extracts showed anti-insulin resistance effects in diabetic rats. On the basis of our statistical analyzing, treating diabetic rats with all of the three extracts of S. persica decreased the elevated levels of alanine phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine transferase. Also, pathological changes in the liver tissue were reduced following treatment with the S. persica. In conclusion, our results give evidence that the S. persica extract, especially aqueous partition, has a healing effect on  and can be considered as an alternative therapy for this disease.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29775155>Long-term surgical outcomes following transsphenoidal surgery in patients with Rathke's cleft cysts.</a></h2><p>Rathke's cleft cysts (RCCs) are benign epithelial lesions of the sellar region typically treated via a transsphenoidal approach with cyst fenestration and drainage. At present, there is limited evidence to guide patient selection for operative treatment. Furthermore, there is minimal literature describing factors contributing to cyst recurrence.The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of 109 consecutive cases of pathology-confirmed RCCs treated via a transsphenoidal approach at a single center from 1995 to 2016. The majority of cases (86.2%) involved cyst fenestration, drainage, and partial wall resection. Long-term outcomes were analyzed.A total of 109 surgeries in 100 patients were included, with a mean follow-up duration of 67 months (range 3-220 months). The mean patient age was 44.6 years (range 12-82 years), and 73% were women. The mean maximal cyst diameter was 14.7 mm. Eighty-eight cases (80.7%) were primary operations, and 21 (19.3%) were reoperations. Intraoperative CSF leak repair was performed in 53% of cases and was more common in reoperation cases (71% vs 48%, p < 0.001). There were no new neurological deficits or perioperative deaths. Two patients (1.8%) developed postoperative CSF leaks. Transient  (DI) developed in 24 cases (22%) and permanent DI developed in 6 (5.5%). Seven cases (6.4%) developed delayed postoperative hyponatremia. Of the 66 patients with preoperative headache, 27 (44.3%) of 61 reported postoperative improvement and 31 (50.8%) reported no change. Of 31 patients with preoperative vision loss, 13 (48.1%) reported subjective improvement and 12 (44.4%) reported unchanged vision. Initial postoperative MRI showed a residual cyst in 25% of cases and no evidence of RCC in 75% of cases. Imaging revealed evidence of RCC recurrence or progression in 29 cases (26.6%), with an average latency of 28.8 months. Of these, only 10 (9.2% of the total 109 cases) were symptomatic and underwent reoperation.Transsphenoidal fenestration and drainage of RCCs is a safe and effective intervention for symptomatic lesions, with many patients experiencing improvement of headaches and vision. RCCs show an appreciable (although usually asymptomatic) recurrence rate, thereby mandating serial follow-up. Despite this, full RCC excision is typically not recommended due to risk of hypopituitarism, DI, and CSF leaks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30704618>Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitory activities of ursane-type triterpenes from Chinese raspberry, fruits of Rubus chingii.</a></h2><p>Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has led to an intense interest in developing its inhibitors as anti-, anti-obesity and anti-cancer agents. The fruits of Rubus chingii (Chinese raspberry) were used as a kind of dietary traditional Chinese medicine. The methanolic extract of R. chingii fruits exhibited significant PTP1B inhibitory activity. Further bioactivity-guided fractionation resulted in the isolation of three PTP1B inhibitory ursane-type triterpenes: ursolic acid (1), 2-oxopomolic acid (2), and 2α, 19α-dihydroxy-3-oxo-urs-12-en-28-oic acid (3). Kinetics analyses revealed that 1 was a non-competitive PTP1B inhibitor, and 2 and 3 were mixed type PTP1B inhibitors. Compounds 1-3 and structurally related triterpenes (4-8) were further analyzed the structure-activity relationship, and were evaluated the inhibitory selectivity against four homologous protein tyrosine phosphatases (TCPTP, VHR, SHP-1 and SHP-2). Molecular docking simulations were also carried out, and the result indicated that 1, 3-acetoxy-urs-12-ene-28-oic acid (5), and pomolic acid-3β- (6) bound at the allosteric site including α3, α6, and α7 helix of PTP1B.Copyright © 2019 China Pharmaceutical University.

In recent years, PTP1B has become an important target for controlling insulin resistance and type 2 . In the present study, the ethyl  extract of leaves of  (IC = 4.92 µg/mL) was assessed by high-resolution PTP1B inhibition profiling combined with HPLC-HRMS-SPE-NMR for identification of antidiabetic compounds. This disclosed eleven PTP1B inhibitors, including five polyphenolics: 1--()-caffeoyl-4,6-di--galloyl-β-d-glucopyranose (), myricetin 3--α-l-rhamnopyranoside (), quercetin 3--(2″-galloyl)-α-l-rhamnopyranoside (), mearnsetin 3--α-l-rhamnopyranoside (), and kaempferol 3--α-l-arabinopyranoside () as well as eight triterpenoids: maslinic acid (), 3--sumaresinolic acid (), sumaresinolic acid (), 3----coumaroyl maslinic acid (), 3----coumaroyl maslinic acid (), 3----coumaroyl 2α-hydroxydulcioic acid (), oleanolic acid (), and ursolic acid ().

Interestingly, some reports suggested that javamide-II found in coffee may have anti-inflammatory activity greater than that of caffeine, but there is limited information about its effect on TNF-α production by activated lymphocytes. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of javamide-II on TNF-α was investigated in PMA/PHA-treated lymphocytic Jurkat cells. At 5 μM, javamide-II, not caffeine, inhibited TNF-α production in the cells (45 ± 4%, P < 0.001). To elucidate the underlying mechanism, the phosphorylation of MAP kinases (ERK, p38, and JNK) was investigated in the Jurkat cells. Javamide-II had little effect on JNK or p38 phosphorylation, but javamide-II (<20 μM) decreased ERK phosphorylation, consequently reducing TNF-α mRNA expression in the cells ( P < 0.001). The involvement of ERK phosphorylation was also confirmed by an ERK1/2 inhibitor (SCH772984). Furthermore, javamide-II was also found to inhibit IL-2 production, which is up-regulated by ERK phosphorylation in cells ( P < 0.001). These data suggested that javamide-II may be a potent compound to suppress TNF-α production more efficiently than caffeine by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation in Jurkat cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30419343>Spectrum-effect relationships between high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprints and anti-inflammatory activities of Leontopodium leontopodioides (Willd.) Beauv.</a></h2><p>Leontopodium leontopodioides (Willd.) Beauv. is used therapeutically to prevent numerous diseases. Historically, L. leontopodioides extracts have been used to treat influenza infections, bronchitis, acute and chronic nephritis, proteinuria, hematuria, and . However, the bioactive compounds that are responsible for the associated therapeutic effects have not yet been characterized. In this study, high-performance liquid chromatography was utilized to study the anti-inflammatory properties of L. leontopodioides through analysis of spectrum-effect relationships. The bioactive compounds that correlated with anti-inflammatory activities were partially identified. Following aqueous extraction, a variety of different polar organic solvents including petrol ether extracts, ethyl  extracts, n-butanol extracts, and residual aqueous extracts were successfully isolated from L. leontopodioides. These extracts were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography to generate HPLC fingerprints. A total of 32 common peaks were selected following a similarity analysis (SA). The spectrum-effect relationship was subsequently studied and inflammatory factors were identified following acute inflammatory experiments. The results revealed that the main peaks associated with anti-inflammatory activities were x1, x3, x4, x13, x14, x16 for interleukin-1 (IL-1), x5, x8, x9, x18, x26, x27, x30, x31, x32 for interleukin-6 (IL-6), and x28 and x29 for leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Following analysis of HPLC data, peaks x9 and x14 were identified as chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid, respectively. The current study utilized HPLC and pharmacological analyses to formulate a spectrum-effect relationship and identify bioactive compounds in L. leontopodioides.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It is most likely caused by a gradual, intermittent autoimmune destruction of myelin. The disorder is characterized by a relapsing-remitting course, but in a small proportion of paitents, it is unremittingly progressive even from the onset. The disease typically presents between the ages of 20 and 40 years and is more common in women than men. Rates of multiple sclerosis vary geographically, being highest in Northern parts of Europe and the United States and in Canada. Multiple sclerosis affects an estimated 400,000 persons in the United States and is the most common cause of neurologic disability in young adulthood. Therapies of multiple sclerosis can be divided into disease modifying agents and symptomatic therapies. The disease modifying agents are largely immunomodulatory drugs including interferon beta-1a (Avonex, 1994 and Rebif, 2003), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron, 1993 and Extavia, 2008), peginterferon beta-1a (Plegridy, 2014), glatiramer  (Copaxone, 1996), alemtuzumab (Lemtrada, 2001), fingolimod (Gilenya, 2010), teriflunomide (Aubagio, 2012), and dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera, 2013). Disease modifying agents that are used in resistant cases of multiple sclerosis some of which are not specifically approved for this use (off-label use) include methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulins, mitoxantrone (Novantrone), and natalizumab (Tysabri [now withdrawn]). The disease modifying agents are more effective in relapsing-remitting forms of disease than in the more severe and intractable progressive forms. Symptomatic therapies developed for multiple sclerosis include dalfampridine (4-aminopyrine, Ampyra: 2010), a potassium channel blocker that improves mobility and walking speed in patients with relapsing-remitting forms of multiple sclerosis. While transient, asymptomatic and mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations occur not uncommonly with most of the drugs used to treat multiple sclerosis, clinically apparent hepatotoxicity is rare. Nevertheless, several convincing instances of acute liver injury have been reported for the various forms of interferon beta and glatiramer . Importantly, clinically apparent liver injury was usually first attributed to these two agents several years after their introduction, and initially they were not believed to be hepatotoxic. Thus, the more recently introduced agents (fingolimod, teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate) have not had wide enough general use to state that they do not cause clinically apparent liver injury, and all three have been associated occasionally with marked but transient increases in serum aminotransferase levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31436116>Bioassay-guided fractionation and identification of antidiabetic compounds from the rind of  Var. nana.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the antidiabetic potential of the rind of  var. nana. Acute oral toxicity test revealed the safety profile of its ethanolic extract. The extract was administered at 200 mg/kg b.wt to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Serum diagnostic markers of  (insulin, glucose and glycated hemoglobin), inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and nitric oxide), and oxidative stress (total antioxidant capacity and reduced glutathione and malondialdehyde) were assayed. The ethanolic extract was further fractionated and assessed for the aforementioned bioactivities at two different doses (100 and 200 mg/kg b.wt). The results revealed that the ethyl  fraction of rind exhibited the highest activities. Using different chromatographic techniques, four compounds were isolated and identified as rutin, gallic acid, nictoflorin, and tulipanin.

Animals were exposed to heavy metals for 30 days, Pb was injected as lead  (CHOPb), Mn was injected as manganese chloride (MnCl), Cd was injected as cadmium chloride (CdCl), and As was administered orally to rats in the form of sodium arsenite (AsONa). Results showed that metal deposition trends in tissues were Pb > As > Cd > Mn and the urinary metal levels were Pb > Cd > As > Mn. Diabetic metal alone, as well as metal mixture-treated groups, showed decreased urinary metal levels as compared with non-diabetic metal alone and metal mixture-treated groups. Both diabetic- and non-diabetic metal mixture-treated groups revealed an increasing trend of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine. In addition, heavy metal treatments resulted in elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the kidney tissue while decreased levels of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione (GHS) were observed in the kidney tissue in comparison with the control group. The histological analysis of the kidney tissues showed tubular degeneration, fibrosis, and vacuolation as a result of heavy metal exposure. The present study revealed that co-exposure of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Mn, As) induced more nephrotoxicity as compared with the metal alone treatment. Moreover, diabetic Wistar rats are more prone to kidney damage as a result of heavy metal exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382601>Antioxidant, Antidiabetic, and Anticholinesterase Activities and Phytochemical Profile of  Wedd.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress is involved in different diseases, such as  and neurodegenerative diseases. The genus  includes about 70 species of flowering plant species; most of them are commonly used as food and in particular as a tea infusion in the Andean region of South America in folk medicine to treat various chronic diseases.  Wedd. aerial parts were firstly analyzed for their in vitro antioxidant activity using different complementary assays. In particular, radical scavenging activity was tested against biological neutral radical DPPH; ferric reducing power and lipid peroxidation inhibitory capacity (FRAP and -Carotene Bleaching tests) were also determined. The Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index (RACI) was used to compare data obtained by different assays. Then, the inhibitory ability of samples was investigated against -amylase and -glucosidase enzymes involved in  and against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes considered as strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's or Alzheimer's diseases.

This naturally occurring molecule is present at high concentrations in several mammalian excitable tissues such as muscles and brain, while it can be found at low concentrations in a few invertebrates. Carnosine has been shown to be involved in different cellular defense mechanisms including the inhibition of protein cross-linking, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species detoxification as well as the counteraction of inflammation. As a part of the immune response, macrophages are the primary cell type that is activated. These cells play a crucial role in many diseases associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, including atherosclerosis, , and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, carnosine was first tested for its ability to counteract oxidative stress. In our experimental model, represented by RAW 264.7 macrophages challenged with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitors, carnosine was able to decrease the intracellular concentration of superoxide anions (O•) as well as the expression of Nox1 and Nox2 enzyme genes. This carnosine antioxidant activity was accompanied by the attenuation of the PMA-induced Akt phosphorylation, the down-regulation of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNAs, and the up-regulation of the expression of the anti-inflammatory mediators IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β1. Additionally, when carnosine was used at the highest dose (20 mM), there was a generalized amelioration of the macrophage energy state, evaluated through the increase both in the total nucleoside triphosphate concentrations and the sum of the pool of intracellular nicotinic coenzymes. Finally, carnosine was able to decrease the oxidized (NADP)/reduced (NADPH) ratio of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate in a concentration dependent manner, indicating a strong inhibitory effect of this molecule towards the main source of reactive oxygen species in macrophages. Our data suggest a multimodal mechanism of action of carnosine underlying its beneficial effects on macrophage cells under oxidative stress and inflammation conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353702>4,5-dicaffeyolquinic acid improves high-fat diet-induced cognitive dysfunction through the regulation of insulin degrading enzyme.</a></h2><p>This study was performed to investigate the effects of Artemisia argyi and 4,5-dicaffeyolquinic acid (4,5-diCQA) as a main compound of ethyl  fraction from Artemisia argyi (EFAA) on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced cognitive dysfunction. Both EFAA and 4,5-diCQA were effective in improving cognitive function on HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction. In brain tissue analysis, it was confirmed that EFAA and 4,5-diCQA inhibited the reduction of neurotransmitters as well as oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, they inhibited amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation by increasing the expression of insulin-degrading enzyme and consequently prevented apoptosis. In conclusion, it is presumed that Artemisia argyi may help to improve the cognitive impairment due to the HFD, and it is considered that this effect is closely related to the physiological activity of 4,5-diCQA. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Artemisia argyi is used in traditional herbal medicine in Asia. Type 2  has been proven by a variety of epidemiological studies to be a risk factor for cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease. This study confirmed that 4,5-diCQA is a bioactive compound of Artemisia argyi on improving HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, this study can provide useful information to the effect of Artemisia argyi and related substance.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620140>Preoperative anti-inflammatory treatment of diabetic patients does not improve recovery from cataract surgery when postoperatively treated with a combination of prednisolone  and nepafenac.</a></h2><p>To examine preoperative anti-inflammatory treatment on recovery from cataract surgery in eyes of diabetic patients.A Prospective randomized clinical trial.

Quantifying the potential risks facing adult patients taking desmopressin has taken on added importance because a new intranasal formulation of desmopressin was approved by the FDA in 2017. Like the old formulation, the main active ingredient is desmopressin , but the new formulation also contains an excipient designed to enhance absorption. Our objective was to quantify the rate of hyponatremia in routine clinical care for patients prescribed the older formulation of desmopressin.We conducted a population-based new-user cohort study from 1 February 2006 to 1 February 2017 using a nationwide commercial health plan database. Patients newly prescribed the older formulation of desmopressin were propensity-score (PS)-matched to patients newly prescribed oxybutynin. As a sensitivity analysis, tamsulosin was used as the comparator rather than oxybutynin. The primary outcome was a primary position diagnosis of hyponatremia. Proportional hazard models after 1:1 PS matching were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We identified 3,137 adults who were newly prescribed desmopressin and matched them to 3,137 adults who were newly prescribed oxybutynin. Mean age was 70, 55% were male, 13% filled a prescription for a diuretic during the baseline time period, and the mean baseline sodium prior to receiving either study drug was 140 mmol/L (normal: 135-145). The rate of hyponatremia was 146 per 1,000 person-years for adults prescribed desmopressin compared to 11 per 1,000 person-years for adults prescribed oxybutynin, corresponding to a 13-fold higher rate (HR 13.19; 95% CI 6.69, 26.01; p < 0.01). When follow-up was truncated at 30 days, a similar increased rate was observed (HR 19.41; 95% CI 7.11, 52.99; p < 0.01). A higher rate of hyponatremia was also observed with desmopressin when tamsulosin was the comparator (HR 12.10; 95% CI 6.54, 22.37; p < 0.01). Important limitations of our study include unmeasured confounding (for example, over-the-counter medication use, dietary intake), missing data (i.e., only 20% of patients had a baseline serum sodium), and a lack of data on the newer formulation of desmopressin.Use of an older formulation of desmopressin was associated with a marked increased rate of subsequent hyponatremia compared to use of other medications indicated for lower urinary tract symptoms.

Oxysterols were quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Genes and proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis were detected by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. Cholesterol efflux was determined from [H]-cholesterol labeled HPEC and [C]- was used as cholesterol precursor to measure cholesterol biosynthesis and esterification. We detected enhanced formation of ROS and of specific, ROS-derived oxysterols in HPEC isolated from GDM versus control pregnancies. ROS-generated oxysterols were simultaneously elevated in cord blood of GDM neonates. Liver-X receptor activation in control HPEC by synthetic agonist TO901319, 7-ketocholesterol, or 7β-hydroxycholesterol upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC)A1 and ABCG1 expression, accompanied by increased cellular cholesterol efflux. Upregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 and increased cholesterol release to apoA-I and HDL (78 ± 17%, 40 ± 9%, respectively) were also observed in GDM versus control HPEC. The LXR antagonist GGPP reversed ABCA1 and ABCG1 upregulation and reduced the increased cholesterol efflux in GDM HPEC. Similar total cellular cholesterol levels were detected in control and GDM HPEC, while GDM enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis along with upregulated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1) mRNA and protein levels. Our results suggest that in GDM cellular cholesterol homeostasis in the fetoplacental endothelium is modulated via LXR activation and helps to maintain its proper functionality.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TG in plasma and lipoprotein fractions were measured, along with measurement of blood flow in superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries using Doppler ultrasound in six participants.Teduglutide rapidly increased mesenteric blood flow and TG concentrations in plasma, in TG-rich lipoproteins, and most robustly in chylomicrons. L-NMMA significantly attenuated teduglutide-induced enhancement of mesenteric blood flow but not TG mobilization and chylomicron secretion.GLP-2 mobilization of TG stores and stimulation of chylomicron secretion from the small intestine appears to be independent of systemic NO in humans.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30098126>The effects of dietary supplementation with inulin and inulin-propionate ester on hepatic steatosis in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The short chain fatty acid (SCFA) propionate, produced through fermentation of dietary fibre by the gut microbiota, has been shown to alter hepatic metabolic processes that reduce lipid storage. We aimed to investigate the impact of raising colonic propionate production on hepatic steatosis in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Eighteen adults were randomized to receive 20 g/d of an inulin-propionate ester (IPE), designed to deliver propionate to the colon, or an inulin control for 42 days in a parallel design. The change in intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL) following the supplementation period was not different between the groups (P = 0.082), however, IHCL significantly increased within the inulin-control group (20.9% ± 2.9% to 26.8% ± 3.9%; P = 0.012; n = 9), which was not observed within the IPE group (22.6% ± 6.9% to 23.5% ± 6.8%; P = 0.635; n = 9). The predominant SCFA from colonic fermentation of inulin is , which, in a background of NAFLD and a hepatic metabolic profile that promotes fat accretion, may provide surplus lipogenic substrate to the liver.

We hypothesized that faster growth in early infancy may be associated with maternal PFAS concentrations.Among 415 mother-infant pairs in a longitudinal cohort study, we estimated associations between maternal pregnancy serum concentrations of six PFAS and offspring weight and adiposity at ~5 months of age, and growth in early infancy. Linear and logistic regression models were adjusted for potential confounders including maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index. Effect modification by infant sex was evaluated. We evaluated potential confounding by correlated exposures via multipollutant linear regression and elastic net penalized regression.Associations between maternal PFAS concentrations and infant weight and adiposity differed by offspring sex. In male infants, maternal perfluorooctanoate and perfluorononanoate were positively associated with adiposity, with percent fat mass increases of 1.5-1.7% per ln-ng/mL increase in PFAS (median adiposity at ~5 months: 24.6%). Maternal perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) were associated with lower weight-for-age z-score among female infants only (-0.26 SD per ln-ng/mL PFOS, 95% CI -0.43, -0.10; -0.17 SD per ln-ng/mL PFHxS, 95% CI -0.33, -0.01). In analyses pooled by sex, 2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido)  above vs. below the limit of detection was associated with greater odds of rapid growth in weight-for-age (odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.1, 4.3) and weight-for-length (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.8, 6.2). Multipollutant models generally confirmed the results and strengthened some associations.We observed sex- and chemical-specific associations between maternal serum PFAS concentrations and infant weight and adiposity. Multipollutant models suggested confounding by correlated PFAS with opposing effects. Although maternal PFAS concentrations are inversely associated with infant weight and adiposity at birth, rapid gain may occur in infancy, particularly in fat mass.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The crude extracts were evaluated for their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. On the basis of results obtained, the methanolic crude extract of Cornus capitata Wall. was further sequentially fractionated in hexane, diethyl ether, ethyl , n-butanol. Fractions obtained were also evaluated for their α-glucosidase inhibitory potential. The kinetic study was performed using Lineweaver Burk plot to evaluate the type of inhibition. Furthermore, in silico analysis was also carried with active sites of the enzyme (PDB ID: 3WY1) using Autodock4.Among all the plant extracts, Cornus capitata extract showed maximum inhibitory activity. Therefore its methanolic extract was further fractionated with the help of different solvents and the maximum activity was shown by the ethyl  fraction (IC 50 μg/mL). Kinetic analysis indicated that Vmax and Km were increased indicating a competitive type of inhibition. In docking studies, among different constituents known in this plant, betulinic acid showed minimum binding energy (- 10.21 kcal/mol). The kinetic and docking studies have strengthened the observation made in the present study regarding the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of Cornus capitata.The study provided partial evidence for pharmacological basis regarding clinical applications of Cornus capitata in the treatment of  suggesting it to be a suitable candidate for the treatment of postprandial hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668111>Identification of α-Glucosidase Inhibitors in Machilus litseifolia by Combined Use of High-Resolution α-Glucosidase Inhibition Profiling and HPLC-PDA-HRMS-SPE-NMR.</a></h2><p>Type 2  is a chronic multifactorial disease affecting more than 425 million people worldwide, and new selective α-glucosidase inhibitors with fewer side effects are urgently needed. In this study, a crude ethyl  extract of Machilus litseifolia was fractionated by solid-phase extraction using C cartridges to give a fraction enriched in α-glucosidase inhibitors. Subsequent microfractionation and bioassaying of the eluate by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a complementary pentafluorophenyl column allowed construction of a high-resolution α-glucosidase inhibition profile (biochromatogram). This was used to target high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection-high-resolution mass spectrometry-solid-phase extraction-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HPLC-PDA-HRMS-SPE-NMR) analysis toward α-glucosidase inhibitors. This led to the identification of 13 dicoumaroylated flavonol rhamnosides, of which seven (8, 10, 12a, 12b, 16, 17, and 18) are reported for the first time, and two lignans, of which one (5) is reported for the first time.

Current study aimed at isolation and characterization of a furanocoumarin from Bael (Aegle marmelos L.) fruit that can modulate both oxidative stress and inflammation effectively. Ethyl  extract of Bael fruit (EAFB) was subjected to HPLC for identification, purified and characterized using FTIR, NMR and ESI-MS analysis. Predominant peak of EAFB at RT 12.54 min on HPLC was identified as marmelosin with molecular weight of m/z ∼ 271.2. Marmelosin was evaluated for antioxidant, antiproliferative, apoptotic, cancer (Tyrosinase & Galectin-3) and immunomodulatory (NO, TNF-α) potentials employing standard assay systems. Marmelosin possessed potent antioxidant activity with IC of ∼ 15.4 ± 0.32 μM as opposed to standard - gallic acid (IC 1.1 ± 0.08 μM), antiproliferative activity with IC of ∼ 6.24 ± 0.16 μM as opposed to deferoxamine (∼10.8 ± 0.28 μM) and protected cells against cellular/DNA damage. Anti-inflammatory property was evident with significant reduction in the release of NO (∼3.9 fold) and TNF-α (∼3.4 fold), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in addition to the inhibition of NFκB (∼2.7 fold), a transcription factor in Raw 264.7 cells. Marked down regulation of galectin-3 (∼5.5 folds) and tyrosinase (∼11.1 folds) by gene expression analysis substantiated by tyrosinase inhibition (IC - 20.3 ± 1.26 μM Vs.

T1DM was experimentally induced by a single injection of alloxan (135 mg/kg) while T2DM was induced by feeding the animals with drinking water enriched with fructose (10%). Cetrorelix  (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal for 1 week) treatment group was used as a positive control. All rats were killed and blood and testes were collected after 8 weeks of the study. The effects of induced  on the levels of blood glucose and insulin were assessed. The levels of sex hormones and insulin were determined by radioimmunoassay. Histological staining was used to check abnormal patterns of testicular morphology, the diameter of seminiferous tubules, testicular diameter, and germinal layer thickness.A significant reduction in the testosterone, FSH, and LH levels were observed in T1DM, T2DM, and also in cetrorelix -treated groups. Analysis of testicular histology sections revealed significantly reduced thickness of cell layer in T1DM and cetrorelix -treated groups compared with the T2DM group. In T2DM, the cell numbers, the thickness of cell layer, the diameter of seminiferous tubules, and weight of testicles were slightly increased. In contrast, total tubules of empty seminiferous increased significantly in T1D and cetrorelix treated groups compared with the control group.Overall,  can induce hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis dysfunction, affects hormonal secretion, and causes histological damage to testes, collectively leading to deleterious effects on male fertility.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678666>11β Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase - 1 activity in type 2 : a comparative study.</a></h2><p>A comparative study of 11 β HSD 1 activity in type 2  subjects with respect to fasting blood glucose and other metabolic parameters was conducted.A case control experimental study was performed enrolling thirty type 2  patients and thirty age, gender and BMI matched controls using cortisone  test.The rise of serum cortisol after oral 25 mg cortisone  from baseline (dexamethasone suppressed level) is higher in subjects with type 2  and is associated with exercise, BMI, SGOT but not daily calorie intake, lipid parameters and thyroid status.

Because of this, there is a high interest in healthy natural products that could prevent the appearance of such diseases. This paper aims to study the content of fatty acids (FAs) and phenolic compounds of brown alga Laminaria ochroleuca (L. ochroleuca) and to determine the nutritional quality of the lipids extracted using pressurized liquids extraction (PLE) technique. PLE was applied to the algae using four solvents of different polarity (hexane, ethyl , ethanol and ethanol:water 1:1). Results showed that the higher yield (52%), is obtained with ethanol: water solvent, however, both ethyl  and ethanol enrich unsaturated fatty acid (USFA) (palmitoleic, linolenic, linoleic, oleic, araquidonic and eicosapenataenoic) in the lipid fraction of L. ochroleuca, providing extracts up to 55% of their total fatty acid content compared to other solvents. The nutritional quality of the lipids in all PLE extracts was assessed by considering the ω-6/ ω-3 fatty acid ratio and two dietary indexes involved in the risks of coronary heart disease, atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenic (TI). The lower (best) index values are for ethanol extract, 4.4 (ω-6/ ω-3), 0.74 (AI) and 1.05 (TI), followed of ethyl , 4.4 (ω-6/ ω-3), 0.87 (AI) and 1.24 (TI). Finally, the antioxidant capacity of PLE alga extracts in terms of total phenol content (TPC) was analyzed by the Folin-Ciocalteu method.

Medication-induced suppression of these axes can cause adrenal insufficiency (AI) and hypogonadism. Exogenous glucocorticoid use is the most common cause of iatrogenic AI. Our aim is to bring attention to another broadly prescribed medication, megestrol  (MA), as the cause of suppression of both these axes. We report a case of symptomatic hypogonadism and asymptomatic AI in a male patient secondary to MA. The patient presented with decrease in testicular size and erectile dysfunction. His total testosterone and morning cortisol levels were low, but FH, LH, and TSH were normal. His pituitary MRI was unremarkable. Upon discontinuation of MA, the patient's testosterone and cortisol levels normalized and his symptoms resolved. Hypogonadism and AI are known adverse effects of MA, but symptomatic hypogonadism as the primary manifestation has only been reported once in previous literature. Prolonged hypogonadism can lead to sarcopenia, depression, and osteoporosis, while asymptomatic AI carries the risk of becoming overt AI.

Protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated dorsal root ganglia (DRG) P2X3 receptor upregulation is one important mechanism underlying PDN. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that electroacupuncture (EA) at low frequency could effectively attenuate neuropathic pain. Our previous study showed that 2-Hz EA could relieve pain well in PDN. The study aimed to investigate whether 2-Hz EA relieves pain in PDN through suppressing PKC-mediated DRG P2X3 receptor upregulation. A 7-week feeding of high-fat and high-sugar diet plus a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ) in a dose of 35 mg/kg after a 5-week feeding of the diet successfully induced type 2 PDN in rats as revealed by the elevated body weight, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin and insulin resistance, and the reduced paw withdrawal threshold (PWT), as well as the destructive ultrastructural change of sciatic nerve. DRG plasma membrane P2X3 receptor level and DRG PKC expression were elevated. Two-hertz EA failed to improve peripheral neuropathy; however, it reduced PWT, DRG plasma membrane P2X3 receptor level, and DRG PKC expression in PDN rats. Intraperitoneal administration of P2X3 receptor agonist αβ-meATP or PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) blocked 2-Hz EA analgesia. Furthermore, PMA administration increased DRG plasma membrane P2X3 receptor level in PDN rats subject to 2-Hz EA treatment. These findings together indicated that the analgesic effect of EA in PDN is mediated by suppressing PKC-dependent membrane P2X3 upregulation in DRG.

Very few patients with pituitary metastasis are symptomatic. It is often associated with presence of co-existing metastases to other organs. Isolated pituitary metastasis as the first presentation of primary malignancy is uncommon.A 72-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of polyuria, increasing thirst and unexplained weight loss. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was scheduled as part of the investigation. She was kept nil per os for 10 h prior to EGD, after which she developed alteration of consciousness. Further investigation revealed hypernatremia with sodium level of 161 mmol/L and low urine osmolality of 62 mOsm/kg. Her urine output was 300 mL per hour.  (DI) was diagnosed based on evidence of polyuria, hypernatremia, and low urine osmolality. Her urine output decreased and urine osmolality increased to 570 mOsm/kg in response to subcutaneous desmopressin , confirming central DI. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneous gadolinium enhancing lesion at the sellar and suprasellar regions, measuring 2.4 × 2.6 × 3.9 cm compressing both the hypothalamus bilaterally and the inferior aspect of optic chiasm as well as displacing the residual pituitary gland anteriorly. The posterior pituitary bright spot was absent. These MRI findings suggested pituitary macroadenoma. There were also multiple small gadolinium-enhancing lesions up to 0.7 cm in size with adjacent vasogenic brain edema at the subcortical and subpial regions of the left frontal and parietal areas, raising the concern of brain metastases. Pituitary hormonal evaluation was consistent with panhypopituitarism. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies of the pituitary tissue revealed an adenocarcinoma, originating from the lung. Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen was subsequently performed, showing a 2.2-cm soft tissue mass at the proximal part of right bronchus. There was no evidence of distant metastases elsewhere. The final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma of the lung with pituitary metastasis manifesting as panhypopituitarism and central DI. Palliative care along with hormonal replacement therapy was offered to the patient. She died 4 months after diagnosis.Diagnosis of pituitary metastasis is challenging, especially in patients with previously undiagnosed primary cancer.

A relative NP deficiency in men could contribute to their higher risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Epidemiological studies suggest testosterone may contribute to sex-specific NP differences.This study aimed to determine the effect of testosterone administration on NP levels using a randomized, placebo-controlled design.One hundred and fifty-one healthy men (20 to 50 years of age) received goserelin  to suppress endogenous production of gonadal steroids, and anastrazole to suppress conversion of testosterone to estradiol. Subjects were randomized to placebo gel or 4 different doses of testosterone (1%) gel for 12 weeks. Serum N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and total testosterone levels were measured at baseline and follow-up.Men who did not receive testosterone replacement (placebo gel group) after suppression of endogenous gonadal steroid production experienced a profound decrease in serum testosterone (median 540 to 36 ng/dl; p < 0.0001). This was accompanied by an increase in median NT-proBNP (+8 pg/ml; p = 0.02). Each 1-g increase in testosterone dose was associated with a 4.3% lower NT-proBNP at follow-up (95% confidence interval: -7.9% to -0.45%; p = 0.029). An individual whose serum testosterone decreased by 500 ng/dl had a 26% higher predicted follow-up NT-proBNP than someone whose serum testosterone remained constant.Suppression of testosterone production in men led to increases in circulating NT-proBNP, which were attenuated by testosterone replacement. Inhibition of NP production by testosterone may partly explain the lower NP levels in men.

This study, METS-Microbiome, proposes to examine the influence of novel risk factors, the gut microbiota and SCFAs, on obesity, adiposity and weight change in an international established cohort spanning the epidemiologic transition.The parent study; Modeling the Epidemiologic Transition Study (METS) is a well-established and ongoing prospective cohort study designed to assess the association between body composition, physical activity, and relative weight, weight gain and cardiometabolic disease risk in five diverse population-based samples in 2500 people of African descent. The cohort has been prospectively followed since 2009. Annual measures of obesity risk factors, including body composition, objectively measured physical activity and dietary intake, components which vary across the spectrum of social and economic development. In our new study; METS-Microbiome, in addition to continuing yearly measures of obesity risk, we will also measure gut microbiota and stool SCFAs in all contactable participants, and follow participants for a further 3 years, thus providing one of the largest gut microbiota population-based studies to date.This new study capitalizes upon an existing, extensively well described cohort of adults of African-origin, with significant variability as a result of the widespread geographic distributions, and therefore variation in the environmental covariate exposures. The METS-Microbiome study will substantially advance the understanding of the role gut microbiota and SCFAs play in the development of obesity and provide novel obesity therapeutic targets targeting SCFAs producing features of the gut microbiota.Registered  Date first posted: December 20, 2017.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30616569>Antioxidants and α-glucosidase inhibitors from Neptunia oleracea fractions using H NMR-based metabolomics approach and UHPLC-MS/MS analysis.</a></h2><p>Neptunia oleracea is a plant cultivated as vegetable in Southeast Asia. Previous works have revealed the potential of this plant as a source of natural antioxidants and α-glucosidase inhibitors. Continuing our interest on this plant, the present work is focused in identification of the bioactive compounds from different polarity fractions of N. oleracea, namely hexane (HF), chloroform (CF), ethyl  (EF) and methanol (MF).The N. oleracea fractions were obtained using solid phase extraction (SPE). A metabolomics approach that coupled the use of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR) with multivariate data analysis (MVDA) was applied to distinguish the metabolite variations among the N. oleracea fractions, as well as to assess the correlation between metabolite variation and the studied bioactivities (DPPH free radical scavenging and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities). The bioactive fractions were then subjected to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis to profile and identify the potential bioactive constituents.The principal component analysis (PCA) discriminated EF and MF from the other fractions with the higher distributions of phenolics. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis revealed a strong correlation between the phenolics and the studied bioactivities in the EF and the MF. The UHPLC-MS/MS profiling of EF and MF had tentatively identified the phenolics present. Together with some non-phenolic metabolites, a total of 37 metabolites were tentatively assigned.The findings of this work supported that N. oleracea is a rich source of phenolics that can be potential antioxidants and α-glucosidase inhibitors for the management of . To our knowledge, this study is the first report on the metabolite-bioactivity correlation and UHPLC-MS/MS analysis of N. oleracea fractions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31282201>Evaluation of prolyl oligopeptidase and acetylcholinesterase inhibition by  Roxb. from Brazil.</a></h2><p> Roxb.

The aim of this study is to investigate and characterize  as a potential source of antidiabetic compounds. The screening of the active parts used, such as trunk bark, heartwood, and the leaves of  indicated that all these extracted parts used with methanol demonstrated potent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. The in vitro antidiabetic property of  was notably recorded for the first time and showed activity (EC = 0.17⁻0.78 mg/mL) comparable to those of reported potent herbal extracts (EC = 0.25⁻4.0 mg/mL) and higher activity than that of acarbose, a commercial antidiabetic drug (EC = 1.21 mg/mL). The stability tests revealed that the heartwood of  extract (HDT) possesses high pH stability with relative activity in the range of 80⁻98%. Further bioassay-guided purification led to the isolation of 2 active compounds identified as sativanone and formononetin from the ethyl  fraction and water fraction of HDT, respectively. These α-glucosidase inhibitors (aGIs) show promising inhibition against various types of α-glucosidases. Remarkably, these inhibitors were determined as new mammalian aGIs, showing good effect on rat α-glucosidase. The results suggest that  is a potent source of aGIs and suggest promise in being developed as functional food with antidiabetic efficacy.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of short-term intervention with WG rye on cognitive functions, mood and cardiometabolic risk markers in middle-aged test subjects.Rye-based breads were provided to 38 healthy test subjects (aged 52-70y) during three consecutive days in a crossover study design, using white wheat flour bread (WWB) as a reference. The rye-based bread consisted of a WG rye kernel/flour mixture (1:1 ratio) supplemented with resistant starch type 2 (RS2) (RB + RS2). The last bread portion was ingested at 2100 h, and cognitive function, mood and cardiometabolic risk markers were determined the following morning, 11 - 14 h post intake.In comparison to WWB, the RB + RS2 product increased ratings of mood parameters (valance, P < 0.001; activation P < 0.05). No differences were seen in the cognitive tests depending on intervention (P > 0.05). RB + RS2 increased insulin sensitivity (P < 0.05), fasting levels of gut hormones (PYY, P < 0.05; GLP-2, P < 0.01) and fasting concentrations of plasma , butyrate and total SCFA (P < 0.001). In contrast, fasting levels of IL - 1β were decreased (P < 0.05). Insulin sensitivity was positively correlated with working memory test performance (P < 0.05).This study display novel findings regarding effects of WG rye products on mood, and glucose and appetite regulation in middle-aged subjects, indicating anti-diabetic properties of WG rye. The beneficial effects are suggested to be mediated through gut fermentation of dietary fiber in the RB + RS2 product.The study was retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, register number  .

The determination of pharmacokinetic parameters for these two classes of compounds using a simultaneous chromatographic method with a low detection limit is a challenge. In this study, a highly sensitive and simultaneous LC-MS/MS-based bioanalytical method was developed and validated in rat plasma for the estimation of four novel anti-cancer compounds, BIT-15-67 and BNT-11, belonging to the Thiazolidinedione class, and BNUA-108 and BNUA-48, from the quinazolin-4-one class. The analytes were extracted from plasma samples by protein precipitation and separated on a short reverse phase Hypersil Phenyl BDS, 50 × 4.6 mm, 2.4 μm column at a column oven temperature of 40 °C. An isocratic mobile phase, a 20:80 (v/v) mixture of 5 mM ammonium  solution and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, was used for the elution at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The analytes and internal standard, sulfaphenazole, were quantified in the multiple reaction monitoring mode using positive electrospray ionization with specific pair of mass by charge ratio. All standard validation parameters were assessed as per current bioanalytical method validation guidelines in rat plasma. The area response for the four analytes was found to be linear over the concentration range of 1.00 to 1000 ng/mL in rat plasma. The signal to noise at LLOQ of 1 ng/mL was adequate for application to different pre-clinical studies. The intra- and inter-day precision were <11% and accuracy deviated -1.8 to 9.60% from the nominal. The mean recovery was high (about 90%) and consistent for all the analytes over the linear dynamic range of the method. This simple, robust and validated method can be employed to determine the rat plasma concentrations of the four selected anticancer compounds in preclinical studies such as the pharmacodynamic and the pharmacokinetic studies including tissue distribution and excretion, and the toxicokinetic studies. In this study, pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using this method for all the four compounds individually following intravenous administration in rats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and to determine the polyphenolic contents of the  and  fractions.  Plant fractions were obtained using Soxhlet procedures with hexane, dichloromethane, acetonitrile, ethyl , methanol, and butanol solvent, successively. The different fractions were compared according to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities, total phenolic, and total flavonoid contents. The phenolic contribution to the biological activity was evaluated.  The  and  fractions showed the highest antioxidant abilities, notably the polar fractions, which inhibited significantly the radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2--azinobis(3-ethylbenzoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS).

Nonetheless, when dysfunctional, QECs contribute to multiple diseases. Previously, we demonstrated that proliferating endothelial cells (PECs) use fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) for de novo dNTP synthesis. We report now that QECs are not hypometabolic, but upregulate FAO >3-fold higher than PECs, not to support biomass or energy production but to sustain the tricarboxylic acid cycle for redox homeostasis through NADPH regeneration. Hence, endothelial loss of FAO-controlling CPT1A in CPT1A mice promotes EC dysfunction (leukocyte infiltration, barrier disruption) by increasing endothelial oxidative stress, rendering CPT1A mice more susceptible to LPS and inflammatory bowel disease. Mechanistically, Notch1 orchestrates the use of FAO for redox balance in QECs. Supplementation of  (metabolized to acetyl-coenzyme A) restores endothelial quiescence and counters oxidative stress-mediated EC dysfunction in CPT1A mice, offering therapeutic opportunities. Thus, QECs use FAO for vasculoprotection against oxidative stress-prone exposure.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Standard methods for screening and isolating isoflavones are typically labor intensive and time consuming. In this study, a new assay based on ultrafiltration with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry was developed for the rapid screening and identification of ligands for α-glucosidase, xanthine oxidase and lactate dehydrogenase in the extract of Puerariae Flos. Three isoflavones were identified as α-glucosidase inhibitors, three isoflavones were identified as lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors, and no specific binding ligands were identified for xanthine oxidase in the extract. Subsequently, specific binding ligands, puerarin, genistin, and tectorigenin (purities were 90, 60, 99, and 91.73%, respectively), were separated by high-speed counter-current chromatography. The partition coefficient values of the target compounds and resolutions of peaks were employed as indicators and the solvent system and mobile phase flow rate were optimized for two-stage separation. An optimized two-phase solvent system comprised of ethyl /ethanol/water (4:0.5:3, v/v/v) was successfully used to isolate the three compounds from Puerariae Flos. The monomer compounds isolated, collected, and purified by high-speed counter-current chromatography were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, resulting in the isolation of three targeted compounds. The chemical structures of all three targeted compounds were individually identified by ultra high performance liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry. The results demonstrate that ultrafiltration with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry combined with high-speed counter-current chromatography is not only a powerful tool for screening and isolating α-glucosidase and lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors in complex samples, but also a useful platform for identifying bioactive compounds for preventing and treating  and stroke.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The present study investigated the role of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) in the trafficking of the glucose transporter GLUT4 and the glucose homeostasis.Monitoring of GLUT4 trafficking, GLUT4 internalization assay, and glucose uptake assay were carried out using differentiated 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc adipocytes. Akt1/2 and PKC isozymes were knocked-down by transfecting each siRNA. Cell-free PKC assay and in situ PKCα assay with a FRET probe were carried out. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed using BKS.Cg-+Lepdb/+Lebdb/Jcl mice, an animal model of type 2  (DM).DOPE increased cell surface localization of the glucose transporter GLUT4 in differentiated 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc adipocytes, regardless of Akt activation. Likewise, PKCα deficiency increased cell surface localization of GLUT4, that occludes the effect of DOPE. DOPE clearly suppressed phorbol 12-myristate 13--induced PKCα activation in the cell-free and in situ PKC assay. DOPE and PKCα deficiency cancelled endocytic internalization of GLUT4 localized on the plasma membrane after insulin stimulation. DOPE significantly enhanced glucose uptake into cells. A similar effect was obtained by knocking-down PKCα, that occludes the effect of DOPE. In OGTT, oral administration with DOPE effectively restricted an increase in the blood glucose levels after glucose loading in type 2 DM model mice.The results of the present study show that DOPE retains cell surface GLUT4 by suppressing PKCα-driven endocytic internalization of GLUT4, to enhance glucose uptake into cells and restrict an increase in the blood glucose levels after glucose loading in type 2 DM.© 2018 The Author(s).

Therefore, regulating platelet hyperactivity is an ever growing interest. Very recently, basal autophagic process has been demonstrated to be essential for normal functioning of platelets. However, autophagy can be elevated above basal level under conditions like starvation, and how platelets respond in these settings remains to be elucidative. Therefore, in this study we demonstrate a substantial autophagy induction (above basal level) by starvation, which decreases platelet aggregation responses to various agonists. The decreased aggregation in starved platelets was restored in combination with autophagy inhibitors (3-methyladenine and NHCl) and  supplementation. Starved platelets also showed decreased calcium mobilization, granule release, and adhesive properties. Furthermore, ex vivo platelets obtained from starved rats showed increased autophagy markers and decreased aggregation responses to various agonists. Our results distinctly explain that enhanced autophagy and cellular energy depletion are the cause for decreased platelet activation and aggregation.

Thus, we investigated the differences between these cells in insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylation in DR.Retinas were removed from streptozotocin-induced diabetic or healthy rats, and IR expression levels were compared by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry. In vitro assays also were performed in order to determine the expressions of phosphorylated IR in both cells cultured under 5.5 or 25 mM glucose by immunoblot. Cell viability was determined in both cells cultured under different concentrations of phorbol myristate  (PMA), a PKC activator. To determine the involvement of the PI3 kinase pathway of IR, PMA with or without wortmannin-induced changes in Akt was also analyzed.Immunoreactivity to the IR was decreased in diabetic retina. High glucose (25 mM) increased phosphorylated IR levels in endothelial cells but not in pericytes. PMA (1 nM or higher) induced death of pericytes, while endothelial cells were increased. PMA increased phosphorylated Akt in endothelial cells and decreased in pericytes. Wortmannin suppressed the PMA-induced phosphorylation of Akt in endothelial cells.The different responses to 25 mM glucose and PMA were observed between retinal endothelial cells and pericytes.

Octreotide , a long-acting somatostatin analogue, suppresses the secretion of insulin and is recognized as a possible treatment for sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia. However, there are few reports on its use in an actual clinical setting, especially in the elderly. We herein report a case in which subcutaneous injection of octreotide was effective for treating prolonged and recurrent hypoglycemia caused by sulfonylureas in an elderly man. An 89-year-old man was transported to the emergency department of our hospital for disturbance of consciousness in the morning. He had been treated for type 2  with 0.5 mg glimepiride, with the most recent HbA1c measurement being 5.7%. His plasma glucose level was low (22 mg/dL), and he was in a coma (Japan Coma Scale: 300). Under a diagnosis of hypoglycemic coma caused by sulfonylurea, we dripped 10% glucose solution and administered 50% glucose solution every 1 to 2 h through a peripheral vein, but his hypoglycemia recurred several times. Finally, 50 μg octreotide was subcutaneously injected. Thereafter, hypoglycemia did not recur, and additional injections of 50% glucose solution were not required. The same dose of octreotide was additionally administered after 8 h. In conclusion, the subcutaneous injection of octreotide can be an effective and safe method of treating prolonged hypoglycemia caused by sulfonylureas in the elderly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894560>Metabolic phenotypes and the gut microbiota in response to dietary resistant starch type 2 in normal-weight subjects: a randomized crossover trial.</a></h2><p>Resistant starch (RS) has been reported to reduce body fat in obese mice. However, this effect has not been demonstrated in humans. In this study, we tested the effects of RS in 19 volunteers with normal body weights. A randomized, double-blinded and crossover design clinical trial was conducted. The study subjects were given either 40 g high amylose RS2 or energy-matched control starch with three identical diets per day throughout the study. The effect of RS was evaluated by monitoring body fat, glucose metabolism, gut hormones, gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and metabolites. The visceral and subcutaneous fat areas were significantly reduced following RS intake.  and early-phase insulin, C-peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion were increased, and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were decreased after the RS intervention. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, certain gut microbes were significantly decreased after RS supplementation, whereas the genus Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 showed an increase in abundance. Other potential signatures of the RS intervention included Akkermansia, Ruminococcus_2, Victivallis, and Comamonas. Moreover, the baseline abundance of the genera Streptococcus, Ruminococcus_torques_group, Eubacterium_hallii_group, and Eubacterium_eligens_group was significantly associated with the hormonal and metabolic effects of RS.

We investigated the effect of factorial randomisation to a 6-month lycopene and green tea dietary advice or supplementation intervention on 159 serum metabolite measures in 128 men with raised PSA levels (but prostate cancer-free), analysed by intention-to-treat. The causal effects of metabolites modified by the intervention on prostate cancer risk were then assessed by Mendelian randomisation, using summary statistics from 44,825 prostate cancer cases and 27,904 controls. The systemic effects of lycopene and green tea supplementation on serum metabolic profile were comparable to the effects of the respective dietary advice interventions (R = 0.65 and 0.76 for lycopene and green tea respectively). Metabolites which were altered in response to lycopene supplementation were  [β (standard deviation difference vs. placebo): 0.69; 95% CI = 0.24, 1.15; p = 0.003], valine (β: -0.62; -1.03, -0.02; p = 0.004), pyruvate (β: -0.56; -0.95, -0.16; p = 0.006) and docosahexaenoic acid (β: -0.50; -085, -0.14; p = 0.006). Valine and diacylglycerol were lower in the lycopene dietary advice group (β: -0.65; -1.04, -0.26; p = 0.001 and β: -0.59; -1.01, -0.18; p = 0.006). A genetically instrumented SD increase in pyruvate increased the odds of prostate cancer by 1.29 (1.03, 1.62; p = 0.027). An intervention to increase lycopene intake altered the serum metabolome of men at risk of prostate cancer. Lycopene lowered levels of pyruvate, which our Mendelian randomisation analysis suggests may be causally related to reduced prostate cancer risk.© 2018 The Authors.

In addition, treatment with imperatorin () and phellopterin () increased the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ (PPARγ). In diabetic animal model induced by high-fat diets (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ), administration of phellopterin ((), 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) significantly reduced the levels of blood glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol. Taken together, these results indicate that phellopterin () enhances adipocytes differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, phellopterin () significantly prevents HFD/STZ-induced type Ⅱ . The present study also provides phellopterin () may be a valuable therapeutic alternative for enhancing insulin sensitivity through promotion of adipocyte differentiation and by increasing mRNA expression levels of PPARγ, which is a major mediator of insulin sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30339820>Hydrogen sulfide primes diabetic wound to close through inhibition of NETosis.</a></h2><p>-induced neutrophil NETosis impairs wound healing through neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-triggered activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1/2 and p38 is involved in NETosis. Hydrogen sulfide (HS), an endogenous signaling molecule, accelerates diabetic wound healing (DWH), and inhibits ROS production, ERK1/2 and p38 activation, while its level is decreased in . However, it remains unknown whether HS could accelerate DWH through inhibition of NETosis, and whether this inhibitory effect was associated with blockage of ROS-induced ERK1/2 and p38 activation. In order to solve these problems, serum NETs content was measured in diabetic foot patients and healthy individuals. Wound was created in dorsal skin of LepR and control mice and NETs content in wound tissues was tested. An in vitro NETosis model was induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) in isolated neutrophils. Effects of HS in form of NaS on skin wound healing and NETosis were investigated both in vivo and in vitro. It was found that NETs level was highly increased in diabetic foot patients. Comparing with LepR mice, DWH was delayed in LepR mice, accompanied with high NETs level. In PMA-induced NETosis model, peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD)-4 and citrullinated histone H, as well as NETs components dsDNA framework, myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase, were significantly increased. PMA-induced neutrophil NETosis and NETs formation were abolished by treatment with HS. The delayed DWH of diabetic mice was partially restored by intraperitoneal injection of HS, meanwhile, the highly expressed NETosis and NETs release were also down-regulated. The treatment with HS not only attenuated ROS production but also abolished MAPK ERK1/2 and p38 activation. Like the effects of HS, inhibition of MAPK ERK1/2 or p38 could decrease NETs release. These findings suggests that HS attenuates NETosis and primes diabetic wound to heal through blockage of ROS-mediated MAPK ERK1/2 and p38 activation.Copyright © 2018.

The effects of SA and SP on dynamic insulin secretion from perifused islets were quantified by radioimmunoassay, signalling downstream of SCFAs was profiled by single-cell calcium microfluorimetry, and measurement of cAMP was performed using a fluorescence assay. Islet apoptosis was induced by exposure to cytokines or sodium palmitate, and the effects of SA and SP in regulating islet apoptosis were assessed by quantification of caspase 3/7 activities.Deletion of FFAR2 did not affect islet morphology or insulin content. SA and SP reversibly potentiated insulin secretion from mouse islets in a FFAR2-dependent manner. SCFA-induced potentiation of insulin secretion was coupled to Gq activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C, with no evidence of Gi-mediated signalling. SA and SP protected human and mouse islets from apoptosis, and these pro-survival properties were dependent on islet expression of FFAR2.Our results indicate that FFAR2 directly mediates both the stimulatory effects of SA and SP on insulin secretion and their protection against islet apoptosis. We have also shown that SCFA coupling in islets occurs via Gq-coupled intracellular signalling.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29767564>Interorgan Metabolic Crosstalk in Human Insulin Resistance.</a></h2><p>Excessive energy intake and reduced energy expenditure drive the development of insulin resistance and metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 . Metabolic signals derived from dietary intake or secreted from adipose tissue, gut, and liver contribute to energy homeostasis. Recent metabolomic studies identified novel metabolites and enlarged our knowledge on classic metabolites. This review summarizes the evidence of their roles as mediators of interorgan crosstalk and regulators of insulin sensitivity and energy metabolism. Circulating lipids such as free fatty acids, , and palmitoleate from adipose tissue and short-chain fatty acids from the gut effectively act on liver and skeletal muscle. Intracellular lipids such as diacylglycerols and sphingolipids can serve as lipotoxins by directly inhibiting insulin action in muscle and liver. In contrast, fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids have been recently shown to exert a series of beneficial effects. Also, ketoacids are gaining interest as potent modulators of insulin action and mitochondrial function. Finally, branched-chain amino acids not only predict metabolic diseases, but also inhibit insulin signaling. Here, we focus on the metabolic crosstalk in humans, which regulates insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592146>Increased formation of neutrophil extracellular traps is associated with gut leakage in patients with type 1 but not type 2 .</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) with gut leakage in type 1 (T1D) and type 2  (T2D).In all, 105 subjects (56 T1D, 49 T2D) were included in the study. Eight biomarkers of NET formation and gut leakage (ie, protein arginine deiminase type 4 [PAD4], neutrophil elastase [NE], proteinase 3 [PR3], complement 5a [C5a], α -antitrypsin [AAT], DNase I, zonulin, and lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) were measured in serum samples by ELISA. Neutrophils were isolated and stimulated by phorbol myristate  to form NETs in vitro. Neutrophil intracellular contents were then collected and used as antigens to detect anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in the serum.There was an increase in NET-associated proteins (PAD4, NE, PR3, C5a, AAT and DNase I) in new-onset T1D patients but not in those with T2D. Of PAD4, NE, and PR3, PAD4 was found to be the most sensitive biomarker for the diagnosis of T1D. Furthermore, circulating levels of zonulin and LPS were not only increased, but were also strongly correlated with NET formation and ANCA generation in T1D patients.This study provides evidence that increased formation of NETs, particularly PAD4, is closely associated with gut leakage in T1D but not T2D, and suggests that microorganisms and the release of neutrophil cytoplasmic antigen during the formation of NETs may be involved in the pathogenesis of T1D.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643883>Retinoids.</a></h2><p>Retinoids are both natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A, several of which have been developed for medical uses, largely to replace vitamin A which in high, therapeutic doses is associated with considerable toxicity. Retinoids have multiple actions and play important roles in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, vision, bone growth, tumor suppression and immunity. The effects of retinoids are thought to be mediated by their binding to and activation of the retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors which regulate gene expression, important in normal growth and differentiation. Vitamin A in doses that have medical effects was found to be toxic, particularly when given long term. Modification of the vitamin A structure led to retinoid molecules that had many of its beneficial, but fewer of its adverse effects. Oral retinoids in use in the United States include acitretin for psoriasis and isotretinoin for severe nodular acne. Tretinoin is used topically and several other retinoids have been developed for therapy of uncommon forms of cancer (alitretinoin, bexarotene). The commonly used retinoids have many of the side effects of vitamin A including dry skin, cheilosis and nosebleeds and hair loss, but are not stored in the liver and do not cause the typical form of chronic liver disease associated with excessive vitamin A intake. Both acitretin and isotretinoin are teratogenic and embryotoxic and are contraindicated in women who are or intend to become pregnant. Retinoids have been implicated in causing mild-to-moderate elevations in routine liver tests, but these elevations are usually asymptomatic and transient, resolving spontaneously even with continued therapy. Marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during retinoid therapy are uncommon, and dose adjustment or drug discontinuation are rarely required for liver test abnormalities. Nevertheless, laboratory monitoring is recommended with routine liver tests at baseline and one month later, and testing thereafter only if abnormalities were found or symptoms arise. Several retinoids (acitretin, etretinate, retinal ) have been associated with a clinically apparent acute liver injury which typically arises during the first 3 months of therapy, has many features of hypersensitivity and can be severe and even fatal. Interestingly, isotretinoin often causes mild serum aminotransferase elevations and is commonly listed as having frequent adverse effects on the liver, but it has not been convincingly linked to instances of severe clinically apparent, acute liver injury with jaundice. Two retinoids used in dermatology, acitretin and isotretinoin, are discussed in this record and their combined references of retinoids are provided at the end of this introductory section. The hepatotoxicity of vitamin A is discussed separately in another record.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545352>Phytochemical analysis and antidiabetic potential of Elaeagnus umbellata (Thunb.) in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats: pharmacological and computational approach.</a></h2><p>The fruit of Elaeagnus umbellata has high medicinal values and is an excellent source of phytochemicals. This study was aimed to evaluate the antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory and antidiabetic potential of Elaeagnus umbellata.The antioxidant potential of the crude extract and subfractions of E. umbellata fruit were determined using DPPH (2, 20-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2, 2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) assays. The enzyme inhibitory potentials of extracts against α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes were also determined. The in vivo anti-hyperglycemic effects of the extract in STZ-induced type 2  were determined using Sprague Dawley adult rats. HPLC system (Agilent 1260) was used for the identification of bioactive compounds present in extracts. Molecular docking was used to identify and compare the interaction between the compounds (active constituents) and standard inhibitor acarbose with the α-amylase and α-glucosidase active sites.The chloroform, ethyl , and butanol fractions showed significant antioxidant potential with IC values of 40, 45 and 60 μg/mL against DPPH and 57, 70 and 120 μg/mL against ABTS free radicals respectively. The chloroform and ethyl  were highly active against α-amylase and α-glucosidase (IC values 58 and 200 μg/ml against α-amylase 60 and 140 μg/ml against α-glucosidase. The crude extract, chloroform, and ethyl  fractions were more potent in controlling the hyperglycemia in STZ-induced type 2  in rats and considerable reduction of glucose level was observed compared to the non-treated group. Furthermore, the extracts were also found useful in controlling the secondary complications associated with type 2  which was evident from the observed substantial reduction in the blood level of serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, and triglycerides. The molecular docking approach indicated the favorable inhibitory interaction between the docked compounds and the active sites of the α-amylase and α-glucosidase. All docked compounds occupied the same binding site as occupied by acarbose.It was concluded that E. umbellata can be used in the treatment of type 2  and oxidative stress.

Well diffusion method was employed in evaluating the antimicrobial property of the extracts.The ethyl  extract of  leaves had the greatest inhibitory effect on α-glucosidase, followed by the n-hexane with IC 43.95 μg/ml and IC ˃50 μg/ml respectively. The ethyl  also exhibited significant DPPH and ABTS antioxidant activity with IC of 24.96 μg/ml and 6.48 μg/ml as compared to Ascorbic acid and Trolox (12.24 μg/ml and 5.91 μg/ml) respectively. The zones of inhibition of the ethyl  extract of  leaves ranges from 10 - 25 mm at a concentration of 6.25-200 mg/ml, and it showed a greater antibacterial activity than the n-hexane extract, having a zone of inhibition from 10 - 20 mm at concentration of 12.5-200 mg/ml when compared to the standard Gentamycin. Similarly, the ethyl  extract of  showed a better anti fungi activity at concentration range 12.5-200 mg/ml than the n-hexane extract at concentration range of 25-200 mg/ml with reference to Tioconazole. These results indicated for the first time that the ethyl  extract of  leaves extracts exerted potent inhibitory effects against α-glucosidase, actively scavenge DPPH and ABTS free radicals and successfully inhibits the proliferation of Gram positive and Gram negative microorganism.TBL is an important source of antidiabetic, antimicrobial and antioxidant agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537713>Gonadotropin- and Adrenocorticotropic Hormone-Independent Precocious Puberty of Gonadal Origin in a Patient with Adrenal Hypoplasia Congenita Due to DAX1 Gene Mutation - A Case Report and Review of the Literature: Implications for the Pathomechanism.</a></h2><p>Mutations in the DAX1 gene cause X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) classically associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Unexpectedly, precocious puberty (PP) has been reported in some cases, its mechanism remaining unclear.We longitudinally studied a boy with AHC due to DAX1 gene mutation who developed peripheral PP at age 4.5 years. Initially he presented pubic hair, penile enlargement, advanced bone age and elevated testosterone levels. PP progressed with acne, body odour and ejaculations. In addition, we summarized reported findings of patients with DAX1 mutations and PP in the literature in a structured manner providing a basis to discuss possible pathomechanisms of PP in DAX1 patients.In our patient, hydrocortisone treatment was increased to 20 mg/m2/day as suggested in similar published cases. However, despite the suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), this remained without clinical effect or change in laboratory results. The progression of symptoms of pubertal development was well suppressed under cyproterone  treatment. Twenty-four-hour steroid urine excretion rate measurements excluded an effect of adrenal androgens and showed a prepubertal rise of excreted testosterone. Testes size remained small. GnRH testing showed peripheral PP.We hypothesize that an intrinsic, gonadotropin- and ACTH-independent activation of steroidogenesis in the DAX1 deficient testes leads to PP in AHC patients with DAX1 mutations.© 2018 S.

Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Kuntze has been shown to lower blood glucose and attenuate high glucose-induced vascular endothelial cells injury. In the present study we investigated the effects of ethyl  extract of C. chinense (CCE) on PA-induced inflammation and IR in the vascular endothelium and its molecular mechanism. We found that CCE significantly inhibited PA-induced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Consequently, this led to the inhibition of the following downstream adapted proteins myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-  and TNF receptor-associated factor 6. Moreover, CCE inhibited the phosphorylation of Ikappa B kinase  , nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-  B), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular regulated protein kinases, p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and subsequently suppressed the release of tumor necrosis factor-  , interleukin-1  (IL-1  ) and IL-6. CCE also inhibited IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and ameliorated insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Moreover, CCE restored serine/threonine kinase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and thus increased insulin-mediated nitric oxide (NO) production in PA-treated HUVECs. This led to reverse insulin mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation, eNOS phosphorylation and NO production in PA-treated rat thoracic aortas. These results suggest that CCE can significantly inhibit the inflammatory response and alleviate impaired insulin signaling in the vascular endothelium by suppressing TLR4-mediated NF-  B and MAPK pathways. Therefore, CCE can be considered as a potential therapeutic candidate for endothelial dysfunction associated with IR and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29701757>Rapid and Sensitive Quantification of Ursolic Acid and Oleanolic Acid in Human Plasma Using Ultra-performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) interfaced with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass-spectrometry was used to separate and quantify ursolic acid (UA) and oleanolic acid (OA) in human plasma.

Four weeks after induction of  (40 mg kg streptozotocin, i.p.), male Wistar rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (intraluminal thread technique, 60 minutes) and assigned to one of three groups treated with either: vehicle, BZA (3 mg kg  day , i.p.) or 17β-oestradiol (E ) (100 μg kg  day , i.p.). At 24 hours post-ischaemia-reperfusion, brain damage (neurofunctional score, infarct size and apoptosis), expression of oestrogen receptors (ER)α, ERβ and G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor), and activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK)1/2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathways were analysed. At 24 hours after the ischaemic insult, both BZA- and E -treated animals showed lower brain damage in terms of improved neurofunctional condition, decreased infarct size and decreased apoptotic cell death. Ischaemia-reperfusion induced a significant decrease in ERα and ERβ expression without affecting that of G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor, whereas BZA and E reversed such a decrease. The ischaemic insult up-regulated the activity of both the MAPK/ERK1/2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathways; BZA and E attenuated the increased activity of the ERK1/2 pathway, without affecting that of the Akt pathway.

The effects of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) on glucose dysmetabolism and poor fetal outcome induced by gestational androgen excess is also not known. We tested the hypothesis that blockade of androgen receptor (AR) and suppression of late gestational androgen excess prevents glucose dysmetabolism and poor fetal outcome through suppression of adenosine deaminase (ADA)/xanthine oxidase (XO) pathway. Twenty-four pregnant Wistar rats were treated (sc) with olive oil, testosterone propionate (0.5 mg/kg) singly or in combination with SCFA (sodium ; 200 mg/kg; p.o.) or AR blocker (flutamide; 7.5 mg/kg; p.o.) between gestational days 14 and 19. The results showed that late gestational androgen excess led to glucose deregulation, poor fetal outcome, increased plasma and hepatic free fatty acid and lactate dehydrogenase, liver function marker enzymes, malondialdehyde, uric acid, ADA and XO activities. Conversely, gestational androgen excess resulted in reduced body weight gain, visceral adiposity, plasma and hepatic anti-oxidant defenses (glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione/glutathione disulphide ratio, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, adenosine and nitric oxide). However, all these effects were ameliorated by either sodium  or flutamide treatment. The study demonstrates that suppression of testosterone by SCFA or AR blockade protects against glucose deregulation and poor fetal outcome by improvement of anti-oxidant defenses and replenishment of hepatic oxidative capacity through suppression of ADA/XO pathway. Hence, utility of SCFA should be encouraged for prevention of glucose dysmetabolism and poor fetal outcome.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Another patient with a 6-year history of type 2  presented irregular episodes of hypoglycemia after 6 months of treatment with insulin. One patient with a history of Graves' disease showed hypoglycemia after administration of thiamazole.Serum islet cell antibody (ICA) and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA) were negative, while antibody insulin autoantibodies were positive in all the 3 patients. Two patients demonstrated  after an oral glucose tolerance test, while one had normal glucose tolerance. Furthermore, serum insulin levels significantly elevated and did not matched C peptide levels. No abnormalities were found on enhanced MRI of the pancreas, and all 3 patients were clinically diagnosed with IAS.In case one, insulin aspart 30 injection was withdrawn after admission. In addition, the patient was prescribed sublingual acarbose 3 times daily. Two weeks after admission, prednisone  was administered orally once daily at night. In case 2, insulin aspart 30 injection was withdrawn after admission, the patient was prescribed sublingual acarbose 3 times daily with a meal. Five days after admission, oral prednisone  was administered once daily at night.

As partially recruiting reaction steps from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the malate-aspartate shuttle, glutaminolysis takes essential place in physiological and pathological situations. We herein developed a sensitive, rapid, and reproducible liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to determine the perturbation of glutaminolysis in human plasma by quantifying 13 involved metabolites in a single 20-min run. A pHILIC column with a gradient elution system consisting of acetonitrile-5 mM ammonium  was used for separation, while an electrospray ionization source (ESI) operated in negative mode with multiple reaction monitoring was employed for detection. The method was fully validated according to FDA's guidelines, and it generally provided good results in terms of linearity (the correlation coefficient no less than 0.9911 within the range of 0.05-800 μg/mL), intra- and inter-day precision (less than 18.38%) and accuracy (relative standard deviation between 89.24 and 113.4%), with lower limits of quantification between 0.05 and 10 μg/mL. The new analytical approach was successfully applied to analyze the plasma samples from 38 healthy volunteers and 34 patients with type 2  (T2D). Based on the great sensitivity and comprehensive capacity, the targeted analysis revealed the imperceptible abnormalities in the concentrations of key intermediates, such as iso-citrate and cis-aconitate, thus allowing us to obtain a thorough understanding of glutaminolysis disorder during T2D.

We further studied the effects of the GnRH antagonist cetrorelix  (CTX) on cultured adrenocortical tumor (ACT) cells (mouse Cα1 and Y-1, and human H295R), and in vivo in transgenic mice (SV40 T-antigen expression under inhibin α promoter) bearing Lhcgr and Gnrhr in ACT. Both models were treated with control (CT), CTX, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or CTX+hCG, and their growth and transcriptional changes were analyzed. In situ hybridization and qPCR analysis of human adrenocortical carcinomas (n = 11-13) showed expression of GNRHR in 54/73%, LHCGR in 77/100% and FSHR in 0%, respectively. CTX treatment in vitro decreased cell viability and proliferation, and increased caspase 3/7 activity in all treated cells. In vivo, CTX and CTX+hCG (but not hCG alone) decreased ACT weights and serum LH and progesterone concentrations. CTX treatment downregulated the tumor markers Lhcgr and Gata4.

Our data suggest that CTX treatment may improve the therapy of human adrenocortical carcinomas by direct action on GNRHR-positive cancer cells inducing apoptosis and/or reducing gonadotropin release, directing tumor cells towards a healthy adrenal gene expression profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30038575>Age-Related Differential Structural and Transcriptomic Responses in the Hypertensive Heart.</a></h2><p>While aging is a critical risk factor for heart failure, it remains uncertain whether the aging heart responds differentially to a hypertensive stimuli. Here we investigated phenotypic and transcriptomic differences between the young and aging heart using a mineralocorticoid-excess model of hypertension. Ten-week ("young") and 36-week ("aging") mice underwent a unilateral uninephrectomy with deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA) pellet implantation ( = 6-8/group) and were followed for 6 weeks. Cardiac structure and function, blood pressure (BP) and the cardiac transcriptome were subsequently examined. Young and aging DOCA mice had high BP, increased cardiac mass, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased in aging DOCA-treated mice in contrast to young DOCA mice. Interstitial and perivascular fibrosis occurred in response to DOCA, but perivascular fibrosis was greater in aging mice. Transcriptomic analysis showed that young mice had features of higher oxidative stress, likely due to activation of the respiratory electron transport chain. In contrast, aging mice showed up-regulation of collagen formation in association with activation of innate immunity together with markers of inflammation including cytokine and platelet signaling. In comparison to younger mice, aging mice demonstrated different phenotypic and molecular responses to hypertensive stress. These findings have potential implications for the pathogenesis of age-related forms of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29860177>Aromatic aldehydes as selective fluorogenic derivatizing agents for α-dicarbonyl compounds. Application to HPLC analysis of some advanced glycation end products and oxidative stress biomarkers in human serum.</a></h2><p>α-Dicarbonyl compounds (α-DCs) are very clinically important as they are considered as advanced glycation end products (AGEs) precursors and biomarkers for many chronic diseases such as  and vascular diseases, in addition to their major role in progression of complications of such diseases. Aromatic aldehydes and ammonium  were productively used as a one-pot co-reagents for fluorogenic derivatization of α-DCs yielding fluorescent imidazole derivatives. Among the tried aromatic aldehydes, 4-carbomethoxybenzaldehyde yielded the products with best fluorescent characters. This approach for fluorogenic derivatization of α-DCs overcome the selectivity problem of the most commonly used derivatization reagent for α-DCs, α-diamino compounds, that can react unselectively with α-DCs and aldehydes. Separation of the formed imidazole derivatives of five α-DCs including glucosone, 3-deoxyglucosone, glyoxal, methyl glyoxal and dimethyl glyoxal together with ethylmethylglyoxal as an internal standard was carried out on an octyl column using a mobile phase consisted of methanol-water (15:85, v/v%) containing 0.2% formic acid with time programed flow, followed by fluorescence detection at excitation/emission wavelengths of 310/410 nm. The method showed excellent sensitivity for the targeted α-DCs with limits of detections ranging from 0.4 to 5.0 nM in human serum. Simple protein precipitation procedure was used for human serum treatment yielding very good recovery (91-105%) for the targeted α-DCs. The developed method was fully validated, then applied to the analysis of the five above mentioned clinically important α-DCs in serum samples of healthy, diabetic, rheumatic and cardiac disorders human volunteers. Due to the excellent analytical features of the developed method, including high selectivity and sensitivity, it was able to detect the pattern of the targeted α-DCs serum levels under the investigated different clinical conditions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Saliva sampling is advantageous for multisample profiling over longer periods of time, as it is non-invasive, cheap, can be carried out at home and does not require the attendance of clinical personnel. We developed a rapid LC-MS/MS for the measurement of salivary progesterone, frequently assessed as ovulation marker in patients desiring fertility.Samples (300 μL) were prepared by supported liquid extraction using dichloromethane and were reconstituted in 40% methanol. Chromatography was performed using a C8 column with a water/methanol gradient containing 0.1% formic acid and 2 mmol/L ammonium . Quantification was performed with a Waters TQ-S mass spectrometer.Total run time was 5.5 min. The lower limit of quantification was 20 pmol/L (1.2 fmol on column). Inter- and intra-assay comparison showed coefficients of variation and bias between measured and nominal concentrations of less than 11%. Mean recovery was 91%. Interference with a large set of natural and synthetic steroids was excluded. The assay was successfully applied to measure progesterone variation during the menstrual cycle ( n = 9) and diurnal variations during luteal phase ( n = 7) in regularly cycling women.We present a novel LC-MS/MS assay for the determination of salivary progesterone with high-throughput potential.

All patients who had a sensor subcutaneously implanted across 534 participating centers in Europe and South Africa from June 2016 until August 2018 were enrolled. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded at each visit and patients were instructed to inform their clinic if they experienced any AEs between visits. Adverse events were adjudicated for relatedness to the device, procedure, or drug (dexamethasone ). The primary safety endpoint was the rate of related serious adverse events (related SAEs) through 4 sensor insertion/removal cycles.The registry enrolled 3,023 patients. As of last follow-up, 5,417 sensors had been inserted with a total of 1,260 patient-years (PYs) of follow-up; 969 patients had used the system for at least 6 months and 173 patients had used the system for at least one year. No related SAEs were reported. The most frequently reported related AEs were sensor location site infection (0.96%; 2.46 events per 100 PYs), inability to remove the sensor upon first attempt (0.76%; 1.90 events per 100 PYs), and adhesive patch location site irritation (0.66%; 1.59 events per 100 PYs). One non-serious allergic reaction to lidocaine was reported, which resolved with administration of an antihistamine. The full intended sensor life was achieved by 91% of 90-day sensors and 75% of 180-day sensors.The PMCF registry provides real-world evidence that the Eversense CGM system is safe over multiple cycles of use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469342>Short-chain fatty acids and regulation of pancreatic endocrine secretion in mice.</a></h2><p>The intestinal microbiota has been demonstrated to influence host metabolism, and has been proposed to affect the development of obesity and type 2  (T2D), possibly through short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by fermentation of dietary fiber. There are some indications that SCFAs inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in rodents, but research on this subject is sparse. However, it has been reported that receptors for SCFAs, free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) and FFAR3 are expressed not only on gut endocrine cells secreting GLP-1 and PYY, but also on pancreatic islet cells. We hypothesized that SCFAs might influence the endocrine secretion from pancreatic islets similar to their effects on the enteroendocrine cells. We studied this using isolated perfused mouse pancreas which responded adequately to changes in glucose and to infusions of arginine. None of the SCFAs, , propionate and butyrate, influenced glucagon secretion, whereas they had weak inhibitory effects on somatostatin and insulin secretion. Infusions of two specific agonists of FFAR2 and FFAR3, CFMB and Compound 4, respectively, did not influence the pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon, whereas both induced strong increases in the secretion of somatostatin. In conclusion, the small effects of , propionate and butyrate we observed here may not be physiologically relevant, but the effects of CFMB and Compound 4 on somatostatin secretion suggest that it may be possible to manipulate pancreatic secretion pharmacologically with agonists of the FFAR2 and 3 receptors, a finding which deserves further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31479151>Relaxin reduces endothelium-derived vasoconstriction in hypertension: revealing new therapeutic insights.</a></h2><p>Endothelium-derived vasoconstriction is a hallmark of vascular dysfunction in hypertension. In some cases, an overproduction of endothelium-derived prostacyclin (PGI ) can cause contraction rather than relaxation. Relaxin is well-known for its vasoprotective actions, but the possibility that this peptide could also reverse endothelium-derived vasoconstriction has never been investigated. We tested the hypothesis that short-term relaxin treatment mitigates endothelium-derived vasoconstriction in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).Male Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHRs were subcutaneously infused with either vehicle (20 mM sodium ) or relaxin (13.3 μg/kg/h) using osmotic minipumps for 3 days. Vascular reactivity to the endothelium-dependent agonist acetylcholine, was assessed in vitro by wire-myography. Quantitative PCR and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry were used to identify changes in gene expression of prostanoid pathways, and prostaglandin production, respectively.Relaxin treatment ameliorated hypertension-induced endothelial dysfunction by increasing nitric oxide-dependent relaxation and reducing endothelium-dependent contraction. Notably, short-term relaxin treatment upregulated mesenteric PGI receptor (IP) expression, permitting PGI -IP mediated vasorelaxation. In the aorta, reversal of contraction was accompanied by suppression of the hypertension-induced increase in prostanoid-producing enzymes and reduction in PGI -evoked contractions.Relaxin has region-dependent vasoprotective actions in hypertension. Specifically, relaxin has distinct effects on endothelium-derived contracting factors and their associated vasoconstrictor pathways in mesenteric arteries and the aorta. Taken together, these observations reveal the potential of relaxin as a new therapeutic for vascular disorders that are associated with endothelium-derived vasoconstriction including hypertension.This article is protected by copyright.

The NLRP3 inflammasome mediates inflammation in several chronic diseases by processing the cytokines pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and pro-IL-18. In this study, we investigated whether MCC950, a recently-identified inhibitor of NLRP3 activity, reduces blood pressure (BP), renal inflammation, fibrosis and dysfunction in mice with established hypertension.C57BL6/J mice were made hypertensive by uninephrectomy and treatment with deoxycorticosterone  (2.4 mg/day, s.c.) and 0.9% NaCl in the drinking water (1K/DOCA/salt). Normotensive controls were uninephrectomized and received normal drinking water. Ten days later, mice were treated with MCC950 (10 mg/kg/day, s.c.) or vehicle (saline, s.c.) for up to 25 days. BP was monitored by tail-cuff or radiotelemetry; renal function by biochemical analysis of 24-h urine collections; and kidney inflammation/pathology was assessed by real-time PCR for inflammatory gene expression, flow cytometry for leucocyte influx, and Picrosirius red histology for collagen. Over the 10 days post-surgery, 1K/DOCA/salt-treated mice became hypertensive, developed impaired renal function, and displayed elevated renal levels of inflammatory markers, collagen and immune cells. MCC950 treatment from day 10 attenuated 1K/DOCA/salt-induced increases in renal expression of inflammasome subunits (NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1) and inflammatory/injury markers (pro-IL-18, pro-IL-1β, IL-17A, TNF-α, osteopontin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, CCL2, vimentin), each by 25-40%. MCC950 reduced interstitial collagen and accumulation of certain leucocyte subsets in kidneys of 1K/DOCA/salt-treated mice, including CD206+ (M2-like) macrophages and interferon-gamma-producing T cells. Finally, MCC950 partially reversed 1K/DOCA/salt-induced elevations in BP, urine output, osmolality, [Na+], and albuminuria (each by 20-25%). None of the above parameters were altered by MCC950 in normotensive mice.MCC950 was effective at reducing BP and limiting renal inflammation, fibrosis and dysfunction in mice with established hypertension. This study provides proof-of-concept that pharmacological inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a viable anti-hypertensive strategy.© The Author(s) 2018.

DMP had a degree of amidation of 48.7% and was characterized further by FTIR, XRD and DSC analyses. MFM-loaded composites were subsequently accomplished by green synthesis via ionotropic gelation technique using zinc  as cross-linker. The thermal, X-ray and infrared analyses suggested an environment in the composites compatible with the drug, except certain degree of attenuation in drug's crystallinity. Scanning electron microscopy revealed almost spherical shape of the composites. Depending upon the mass ratios of GG:DMP, types of nanofiller (neusilin/bentonite/Florite) and oil inclusion, the composites exhibited variable drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE, 50-85%) and extended drug release behaviours (Q, 69-94%) in  buffer (pH 4.5). The optimized oil-entrapped Florite R NF/GG: DMP (1:1) composites eluted MFM via case-II transport mechanism and its drug release data was best fitted in zero-order kinetic model. The optimized formulation demonstrated excellent gastroretentive properties and substantial hypoglycemic effect in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.

Increasing evidence supports a major role for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) within the brain in the control of RMR.The angiotensin II (ANG) Agtr1a receptor colocalizes with the leptin receptor (Lepr) primarily within cells of the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus that also express Agouti-related peptide (Agrp). This sub-population of Agtr1a receptors is required for stimulation of thermogenic sympathetic nervous activity and RMR, but not the suppression of food intake or increasing blood pressure, in response to various stimuli including high-fat diet, deoxycorticosterone  and salt, and leptin. Agtr1a is localized to a specific subset (SST3) of Agrp neurons within the ARC.The RAS within the ARC is implicated specifically in RMR control, primarily through Agtr1a localized to the SST3 subset of Agrp neurons. Ongoing research is focused on understanding the unique anatomical projections, neurotransmitter utilization, and signal transduction pathways of Agtr1a within this subset of neurons. Understanding these projections and molecular mechanisms may identify therapeutic targets for RMR and thus obesity, independent of blood pressure and appetite.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30266729>Metagenomic Insights into the Degradation of Resistant Starch by Human Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Several studies monitoring alterations in the community structure upon resistant starch (RS) interventions are available, although comprehensive function-based analyses are lacking. Recently, a multiomics approach based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metaproteomics, and metabolomics on fecal samples from individuals subjected to high and low doses of type 2 RS (RS2; 48 g and 3 g/2,500 kcal, respectively, daily for 2 weeks) in a crossover intervention experiment was performed. In the present study, we did pathway-based metagenomic analyses on samples from a subset of individuals ( = 12) from that study to obtain additional detailed insights into the functional structure at high resolution during RS2 intervention. A mechanistic framework based on obtained results is proposed where primary degradation was governed by , with  as a major taxon involved, providing fermentation substrates and increased  concentrations for the growth of various major butyrate producers exhibiting the enzyme butyryl-coenzyme A (CoA): CoA-transferase. H-scavenging sulfite reducers and acetogens concurrently increased. Individual responses of gut microbiota were noted, where seven of the 12 participants displayed all features of the outlined pattern, whereas four individuals showed mixed behavior and one subject was unresponsive. Intervention order did not affect the outcome, emphasizing a constant substrate supply for maintaining specific functional communities. Manipulation of gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a promising approach to reduce various noncommunicable diseases, such as obesity and type 2 . Specific dietary supplements, including resistant starches (RS), are often a focus, yet comprehensive insights into functional responses of microbiota are largely lacking. Furthermore, unresponsiveness in certain individuals is poorly understood. Our data indicate that distinct parts of microbiota work jointly to degrade RS and successively form health-promoting fermentation end products. It highlights the need to consider both primary degraders and specific more-downstream-acting bacterial groups in order to achieve desired intervention outcomes. The gained insights will assist the design of personalized treatment strategies based on an individual's microbiota.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29729383>Ameliorative potential of Lavandula stoechas in metabolic syndrome via multitarget interactions.</a></h2><p>Decoction and infusion prepared from aerial parts of Lavandula stoechas L. (L. stoechas) have been traditionally used as remedy against several components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and associated disorders including type II  and cardiovascular diseases by Anatolian people.The aim is to elucidate the potential ameliorative effects of L. stoechas aqueous extracts on insulin resistance and inflammation models through multitarget in vitro approaches and also to elucidate mechanism of action by analyzing transcriptional and metabolic responses.An aqueous extract was prepared and fractionated to give rise to ethyl  (EE) and butanol (BE) extracts. The anti-insulin resistance effects of BE and EE were evaluated on palmitate induced insulin resistance model of H4IIE, C2C12 and 3T3L1 cells by using several metabolic parameters. Specifically, whole genome transcriptome analysis was performed by using microarray over 55.000 genes in control, insulin resistant and EE (25 µg/mL) treated insulin resistant H4IIE cells. Anti-inflammatory effects of both extracts were analyzed in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages.Both EE and BE at low doses (25-50 µg/mL) significantly decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis in H4IIE cell line by suppressing the expression of PEPCK and G6Pase. In C2C12 myotubes, both extracts increased the insulin stimulated glucose uptake more effectively than metformin. Both extracts decreased the isoproterenol induced lipolysis in 3T3L1 cell line. Moreover, they also effectively increased the expression of lipoprotein lipase protein level in insulin resistant myotubes at low doses. EE increased the protein level of PPARγ and stimulated the activation AKT in insulin resistant H4IIE and C2C12 cell lines. The results obtained from biochemical assays, mRNA/protein studies and whole genome transcriptome analyses were found to be complementary and provided support for the hypothesis that EE might be biologically active against insulin resistance and act through the inhibition of liver gluconeogenesis and AKT activation. Besides, LPS induced inflammation in RAW264.7 macrophages was mainly inhibited by EE through suppression of iNOS/NO signaling, IL1β and COX-2 genes. HPLC-TOF/MS analysis of EE of L. stoechas mainly resulted in caffeic acid, apigenin, luteolin, rosmarinic acid and its methyl ester, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, ferrulic acid and salicylic acid.Data suggest that EE of L. stoechas contains phytochemicals that can be effective in the treatment/prevention of insulin resistance and inflammation.

The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), DPPH scavenging activity and the ameliorative effects of the extracts on Fe-induced oxidative injury was investigated both in vitro and ex vivo. Alpha glucosidase and pancreatic lipase inhibitory potentials of the extracts were examined in vitro, while the effects of the ethanol extract on abdominal glucose intake and muscle glucose uptake were determined in freshly harvested tissues ex vivo. The extracts were subjected to Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to identify their possible bioactive components. The ethanol extract showed the most potent FRAP and DPPH radical scavenging activities compared to other extracts. All extracts increased catalase and SOD activities, and GSH levels in oxidative pancreatic injury. Both ethanol and aqueous extracts exhibited remarkable enzyme inhibitory activities, which was significantly higher than ethyl  extract and acarbose but was not comparable to orlistat. The ethanol extract portrayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on jejunal glucose uptake and enhancement of muscle glucose uptake. 9-(4 methoxyphenyl) xanthene, xanthone and stigmasterol showed strong binding affinities for α-glucosidase and lipase enzymes tested. Data from this study suggest that aerial parts of B. diffusa (particularly the ethanol extract) may not only exhibit antioxidant potentials but may also mediate anti-lipidemic and anti-hyperglycemic effects via inhibiting fat and carbohydrate digestion as well as abdominal glucose intake and enhancing muscle glucose uptake.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The disease is a major burden on both economic and social levels, and there is a need for improved drugs with fewer side effects in the management of the disease. Current methods for isolation of anti-diabetic lead compounds from complex mixtures suffer from low resolution and sensitivity, and there is a need for improved alternatives. In this work, magnetic ligand fishing combined with high-performance liquid chromatography - photodiode-array detection - high-resolution mass spectrometry - solid-phase extraction - nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HPLC-PDA-HRMS-SPE-NMR) was developed and validated, with the aim of accelerating discovery of natural products targeting α-amylase. The enzyme was successfully immobilized onto magnetic beads and retained its catalytic activity for a period of 75 days, and the specificity of this method was successfully validated by testing the N-terminus coupled α-amylase immobilized magnetic beads on an artificial mixture. A proof of concept experiment, using a crude ethyl  extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves, proved that it was possible to fish out four α-amylase ligands.

In this in vitro study, rat myoblast (L6) cells were differentiated to myotubes and were exposed to sub-toxic concentrations (10 mg/l and 20 mg/l) of Malathion for 18 hours. Total antioxidant level and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by myotubes were assayed. Activation of JNK, NFκB, p38MAPK and insulin signaling from tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and serine phosphorylation of Akt were assessed in myotubes after Malathion exposure by western blot and was compared with those in controls. Paraoxonase (PON) activity was measured in cell lysate using p-nitrophenyl  as substrate. PON1 and PON2 expression in myotubes were assessed by PCR. The glucose uptake and total antioxidant level in L6-derived myotubes after sub-toxic exposure to Malathion were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Phosphorylation levels of RSKs (JNK, p38MAPK and IκBα component of NFκB) were increased and that of IRS-1 and Akt on insulin stimulation was decreased following Malathion exposure as compared to those in controls. PON1 and PON2 genes were expressed in myotubes with and without Malathion exposure. Significant PON activity was present in cell lysate. We conclude that sub-toxic Malathion exposure induces oxidative stress in muscle cells activating RSKs that impairs insulin signaling and thereby insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle cells.

Nevertheless, -induced changes in macrophage secretory products remained largely unknown. We thus analyzed high-glucose (HG)-induced changes in secretome of human macrophages derived from U937 human monocytic cell line after phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) activation. Serum-free culture supernatants were collected from macrophages exposed to 5.5 mM glucose (NG-M-sup) (normal control), 25 mM glucose (HG-M-sup), or 5.5 mM glucose + 19.5 mM mannitol (MN-M-sup) (osmotic control) for 16 h. After dialysis and lyophilization, secreted proteins were subjected to 2-DE analysis (n = 5 gels derived from 5 independent cultures per group). Quantitative analysis and statistics revealed 23 protein spots whose secretory levels significantly differed among the three conditions. These proteins were successfully identified by nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS analyses and changes in levels of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), HSP70, HSP60, and β-actin were confirmed by Western blotting. Global protein network and functional enrichment analyses revealed that the altered proteins in HG-M-sup were involved mainly in regulation of immune response that might communicate with other bystander cells through the release of extracellular vesicles.

Therefore, the control of hyperglycemia is the main target in the treatment of . The present study investigated the scavenging and ameliorative potentials of different fractions of Azadirachta indica (A. indica) ethanol stem bark extract in Fe-induced oxidative injury in hepatic tissue as well as their ability to inhibit enzymes linked to  and in enhancing muscle glucose uptake via some in vitro and ex vivo experimental models. The results revealed that the butanol fraction of the extract showed a significantly (p < 0.05) higher DPPH scavenging activity than the other fractions (IC 0.0154 μg/mL), while the aqueous fraction showed the highest FRAP activity (IC 25.32 μg/mL). Although all the fractions ameliorated Fe-induced oxidative injury in hepatic tissue by significantly reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in a dose dependent manner, the butanol fraction showed the highest activity in this regard. In addition, the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly improved by the butanol and dichloromethane fractions. Butanol and ethyl  fractions showed the highest inhibitory effect on α-glucosidase (IC 0.23 μg/mL) and α-amylase (IC 14.79 μg/mL) activities, respectively. Although all the fractions significantly improved glucose uptake in psoas muscle with or without insulin, the butanol fraction showed the highest activity (GU 6.22 μg/mL) in this regard. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis of the fractions revealed the presence of sistosterol, stigmasterol, campestrol, squalene, nimbiol among others. Molecular docking of some of these compounds with AMP-activated protein kinase (α-AMPK), α-amylase and α-glucosidase showed a positive interaction.

Under metformin treatment, disturbances of the intestinal microbes lead to increased abundance of  spp.,  and decreased abundance of . This alteration may potentially lead to adverse effects on the host metabolism, with the depletion of butyrate producer genus. However, an increased production of butyrate and propionate was verified in metformin-treated Type 2  (T2D) patients. The mechanisms underlying these nutritional alterations and their relation with gut microbiota dysbiosis remain unclear. Here, we used Genome-scale Metabolic Models of the representative gut bacteria  spp., , and  to elucidate their bacterial metabolism and its effect on intestinal nutrient pool, including macronutrients (e.g., amino acids and short chain fatty acids), minerals and chemical elements (e.g., iron and oxygen). We applied flux balance analysis (FBA) coupled with synthetic lethality analysis interactions to identify combinations of reactions and extracellular nutrients whose absence prevents growth. Our analyses suggest that  sp. is the bacteria least vulnerable to nutrient availability. We have also examined bacterial contribution to extracellular nutrients including short chain fatty acids, amino acids, and gasses. For instance,  sp. and  may contribute to the production of important short chain fatty acids (e.g.,  and butyrate, respectively) involved in the host physiology under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. We have also identified pathway susceptibility to nutrient availability and reaction changes among the four bacteria using both FBA and flux variability analysis.

() in high yield. The mixture of chloroform-ethyl  (70:30) was chosen as the solvent system because rosmarinic acid gave the lowest solvation free energy in that solvent system based on the computational solubility prediction. The crude extract of the plant was fractionated by C18 reversed phase absorbent to recover rosmarinic acid. The content of rosmarinic acid was increased from 4.0% / to 6.7% / after fractionation. The radical scavenging activity of rosmarinic acid rich fraction (IC = 38.3 μg/mL) was higher than the crude extract (IC = 58.85 μg/mL) based on the DPPH assay. Several phytochemicals were also identified based on the detection of fragment ions of target compounds. Fractions 1 to 3 could be combined to be a rosmarinic acid rich fraction. Simultaneously, the combination of fractions 4 to 6 could obtain a plant fraction rich in rosmarinic acid, sinensetin and eupatorin, whereas fractions 7 to 9 could be combined as a sinensetin rich fraction. The preparation of known phytochemical profile of  fraction is highly required for value added product formulation and pharmacological studies, particularly for anti- and kidney related diseases which had previously been reported attributed to this herbal plant. This is the first study using solvation free energy to predict the suitable solvent system for rosmarinic acid extraction from highly complex herbal sample using the technology of solid phase extraction.

Therefore, anti-inflammatory therapy is important for the prognosis of patients with . Linagliptin is the only bile-excreted, anti-diabetic oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. Although the anti-inflammatory effects of DPP-4 inhibitors in vivo and in vitro have been reported, few in vitro studies have examined the effects of linagliptin using monocytes, which play a central role in arteriosclerosis-related inflammation. Herein, we assessed the anti-inflammatory effects of linagliptin in human U937 monocytes.U937 cells at densities of 1 × 10 cells/mL were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum and treated with 100 nM phorbol myristate  for 48 h for differentiation into macrophages. The media were replaced, and the cells were pretreated with 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 nM linagliptin for 1 h or were left untreated.

The process is implemented by using complex or minimal media with different feeding strategies. To understand the effect of amino acids, E. coli B and K were grown at a steady state of 0.35 h in glucose minimal medium with and without amino acids, while their metabolism, protein abundance and gene expression were compared. The results showed that amino acids promoted higher  excretion, higher fatty acid biosynthesis (K strain), repressed glucose uptake rate, and decreased expression of proteins associated with the TCA cycle, glyoxylate shunt and amino acid biosynthesis. In presence of amino acids, E. coli K upregulated fatty acid biosynthesis and repressed more genes and proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis than E. coli B. These findings are correlated with higher yield on glucose (Y) and high specific biomass production rate (q) in K strain in the presence of amino acids. In contrast, pre-formed precursor molecules such as amino acids did not affect fatty acid biosynthesis in E. coli B or Y and q, which were higher than those of E. coli K, suggesting that constitutive synthesis of energetically demanding precursors and higher fatty acid β-oxidation activity is key for high biomass-performer E. coli B. Both strains turned off unnecessary pathways and directed their metabolism to proteome efficient overflow metabolism likely to generate energy and provide protein to functions supporting higher growth rate.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30120944>Attenuation of high glucose induced apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways in RIN-m5F pancreatic β cell lines by Hibiscus rosa sinensis L. petals and its phytoconstituents.</a></h2><p>Hibiscus rosa sinensis petals possess wide range of pharmacological properties, with remarkable nutritional values.  is one of the most devastating diseases affecting the world today.

HCT116 cancer cells were treated with D. bulbifera and stained with Annexin/PI or Hoechst 33342/PI for preliminary confirmation of apoptosis. The dissipation of mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) was determined by flow cytometry. The protein expressions of apoptosis-related proteins such as Bcl-2 family, caspases, Fas, PARP, ERK1/2 and JNK were detected by western blot analysis. Moreover, the HCT116 cells were treated with UO126 and SP600125 inhibitors to verify the involvement of ERK1/2 and JNK protein expressions in inducing apoptotic cell death. Based on the result, D. bulbifera ethyl  fraction (DBEAF) exhibited the most compelling cytotoxicity on HCT116 cells with an IC50 of 37.91 ± 1.30 µg/mL. The induction of apoptosis was confirmed by phosphatidylserine externalization and chromatin condensation. Depolarization of MMP further conferred the induction of apoptosis was through the regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins. Activation of caspase cascades (caspase-3, -9, -8 and -10) was elicited followed by the observation of cleaved PARP accumulation in DBEAF-treated cells. Furthermore, death receptor, Fas was activated upon exposure to DBEAF. Collective apoptotic evidences suggested the involvement of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways by DBEAF in HCT116 cells. Interestingly, the attenuation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation accompanied by the activation of JNK was detected in DBEAF-treated cells.

The results of this comprehensive study revealed that the TTEA significantly restored the altered parameters in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The -induced elevated levels of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis metabolism were significantly controlled by TTEA. In the same, the decreased glycogenesis, glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolisms were significantly increased by TTEA. The enzymatic and non- enzymatic antioxidant levels were significantly elevated in TTEA treated diabetic rats and also the total non-enzymatic antioxidants capacity of serum and liver homogenate were calculated though DPPH inhibition. To conclude, this study demonstrates the anti-diabetic effect of TTEA possibly mediated through regulating carbohydrate metabolism and antioxidant status.Copyright © 2019.

In the present study, we evaluated the acute effects of metformin on the BP and heart rate (HR) responses to oral glucose in patients with T2DM. Ten diet-controlled T2DM patients were evaluated on two occasions in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Participants received either metformin 1 g or saline (control) intraduodenally 60 minutes before ingesting a 50 g glucose drink labelled with 150 mg  C-. BP, HR, plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric emptying (breath test) were evaluated over 180 minutes. Systolic and diastolic BP decreased and HR increased after oral glucose (P < 0.001 for all) on both days. Metformin attenuated the fall in systolic BP (P < 0.001), increased plasma GLP-1 concentrations (P < 0.05) and slowed gastric emptying (P < 0.05) without significantly affecting diastolic BP or HR. In conclusion, metformin acutely attenuates the hypotensive response to oral glucose, associated with augmented GLP-1 secretion and delayed gastric emptying, effects potentially relevant to its favourable cardiovascular profile.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30935088>Paraoxonase 1 Activity, Polymorphism and Atherosclerosis Risk Factors in Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Surgery.</a></h2><p>Paraoxonase1 (PON1), an enzyme connected to high density lipoproteins (HDL) particles, plays an important role in protecting arteries against atherosclerosis. The serum activity and concentration of PON1 depends on several genetic polymorphisms as well as environmental factors.Investigated population consisted of 71 patients aged 43⁻76 years with confirmed coronary heart disease (CHD). Established risk factors of CHD such as hypertension, elevated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), , obesity, smoking and premature CHD in family history were assessed. PON1 genotype for ⁻108C/T promotor region was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragments length polymorphism (PCR⁻RFLP) method. Paraoxonase activity towards paraoxon and arylesterase activity towards phenyl  were measured spectrophotometrically.Significant correlations between  and paraoxonase activity ( ⁻0.264,  0.026) and between the premature coronary heart disease in family history and PON1 activity ( ⁻0.293,  0.013) were found. In multivariate analysis, PON1 paraoxonase activity was independently of confounding factors associated with  (OR = 0.985;  0.024) and premature CHD in family history (OR = 0.983;  0.027). PON1 activity towards aryl  positively correlated with HDL-C level ( 0.255,  0.032). In patients treated with statins, PON1 paraoxonase activity was significantly ( 0.033) higher than in patients without treatment.In diabetic patients with CHD, paraoxonase activity is lower than in normoglycemic patients despite similar lipid profiles.  and positive family history in patients with overt CHD are associated with the serum PON1 activity, which might be an additional factor helpful in evaluating cardiovascular risk in this group of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30245236>α-Glucosidase inhibitory effects of polyphenols from Geranium asphodeloides: Inhibition kinetics and mechanistic insights through in vitro and in silico studies.</a></h2><p>Some Geranium species have been used to treat . To evaluate the scientific basis of this ethnopharmacological use, we aimed to isolate potent α-glucosidase inhibitory metabolites of Geranium asphodeloides Burm. through in vitro bioactivity-guided fractionation. All the tested extracts showed high α-glucosidase inhibitory effect compared to acarbose. Among the tested extracts, the ethyl  subextract showed the highest activity with an IC value of 0.85 ± 0.01 µM. A hydrolysable tannin, 1,2,4-tri-O-galloyl-β-d-glucopyranose (1), and five flavonoid glycosides, kaempferol-3-O-α-rhamnopyranoside (2), kaempferol-3-O-α-arabinofuranoside (3), quercetin-3-O-β-glucopyranoside (4), quercetin-3-O-α-rhamnopyranoside (5), and quercetin-3-O-α-rhamnofuranoside (6), were isolated from the ethyl  subextract.

RA has been reported to be an effective treatment for allergy, , thrombosis, liver steatosis, lung fibrosis and colitis. In addition, RA effectively inhibits tumor growth and induces apoptosis; however, the effects of RA, at non-cytotoxic doses, on the metastasis and angiogenesis of malignant cancer cells have, to be the best of our knowledge, not been identified. In the present study, it was identified that RA suppressed the metastatic potential of MDA‑MB231 breast cancer cells, including colony formation, migration and invasion. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with RA exhibited a decreased ability to form tube-like networks and to migrate across a Transwell membrane, when compared with RA‑untreated HUVECs. Using the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, RA treatment significantly suppressed spontaneous and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis. Furthermore, RA inhibited the production of pro-angiogenic factors, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, pentraxin‑3, interleukin-8, VEGF and placental growth factor under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and suppressed the phorbol 12-myristate 13--induced increase in the gelatinolytic MMP‑9 activity and MMP‑9 expression in HT1080 cells. RA also significantly inhibited the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α pathway, leading to decreased HIF‑1α accumulation and HIF‑1α nuclear expression under hypoxia. These results indicated that RA exhibits potent anti‑metastatic and anti‑angiogenic activities with no cytotoxicity via suppression of the HIF‑1α signaling pathway. Thus, RA may control malignant cancer cells by inhibiting the spread from primary tumors and expansion to distant organs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30650147>Identification and functional characterization of CD8+ T regulatory cells in type 1  patients.</a></h2><p>Type 1  is an autoimmune disease where autoreactive T lymphocytes destroy pancreatic beta cells. We previously reported a defect in CD4+ Tregs cell proliferation and reduced CD4+ Tregs PD-1 expression in patients. Another 'memory-like' regulatory subset, CD8+ Tregs, evaluated as CD8+CD25+FOXP3+, has recently raised interest for their effective suppressive activity. Different CD8+ T cell populations, their proliferation capacity and expression of PD-1 molecule were evaluated by flow-cytometer analysis in newly diagnosed, long-term Type 1  patients compared to healthy normal donors. Under basal conditions, CD8+ Tregs and CD8+ Teffs were seemingly represented among study groups while there was evidence of diminished expression of PD-1 in Teff subsets of long-term patients. After 3 days of PMA/ionomycin stimulation, patients CD8+ Tregs showed decreased percentage in respect to control group. CD8+ Teffs were instead increased in long-term diabetics versus controls. PD-1+CD8+ Tregs were represented at a much lower percentage in long-term diabetic patients, in respect to controls. Importantly, patients CD8+ Tregs and CD8+ Teffs presented a significant proliferation defect in respect to the control group. In conclusion, our study indicates that a defect of CD8+ Tregs is observed in diabetics. This subset could thus represent a novel target of immunotherapy in patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671360>Antidiabetic potential of  Willd leaf extracts through inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase.</a></h2><p>The aim of this work was to evaluate the inhibitory activities of different extracts of  Willd on α - amylase and α - glucosidase at varying concentrations.  is a clinical condition characterized by hyperglycaemia in which an elevated amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma. α - amylase and α - glucosidase inhibitors are used to achieve greater control over hyperglycemia in type 2 .

The water extracts had the highest antioxidant activity, especially those from roots and flowers, and were further appraised for in vitro inhibition of enzymes implicated on the onset of human ailments, namely acetyl- (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) for Alzheimer's disease, α-glucosidase and α-amylase for , and tyrosinase for skin hyperpigmentation disorders. The extracts had a higher activity towards BuChE, and the roots extract had the highest capacity to inhibit tyrosinase. Samples showed a low capacity to inhibit carbohydrate hydrolysing enzymes, except for the root extract with a good inhibition on glucosidase. Samples were then characterized by NMR (1D and 2D): the main metabolites identified in the flowers extract were iridoid glycosides, in particular gluroside and bartsioside. In stems, phenylehanoid glycosides (PhGs) and iridoids were detected, especially acteoside. In roots were detected essentially PhGs, mainly echinacoside and tubuloside A. Docking studies were performed on the identified compounds. A favorable binding energy of tubuloside A to tyrosinase was calculated, and indicated this compound as a possible competitive inhibitor of α-glucosidase and tyrosinase.

Its leaves are widely used in Brazilian folk medicine to treat  and cardiovascular disorders. Although this species' biological potential has been extensively proven as an antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent, there is a lack of studies to evidence its action on the cardiovascular system.This study was designed to investigate the vascular effects of B. forficata leaves preparations and its majority compound kaempferitrin, as well as its aglycone form kaempferol, in rat aortic rings of normotensive (NTR) and hypertensive (SHR) rats.Aorta rings from NTR and SHR precontracted with phenylephrine were exposed to cumulative concentrations of B. forficata extract, fractions (1-50 μg/mL) and compounds (0.001-0.3 μg/mL). The mechanisms involved in the vasorelaxant effect of ethyl- plus butanol fraction (EAButF) were also evaluated.Although kaempferitrin is the most abundant compound found in both methanolic extract and EAButF, 24 minor phenolic compounds were identified in B. forficata leaves, including kaempferol. EAButF was the only with endothelium-dependent and independent vasorelaxant properties in both NTR and SHR. The incubation with L-NAME or ODQ completely blocked EAButF-induced vasorelaxation. On the other hand, the incubation with propranolol, atropine, indomethacin, glibenclamide or barium chloride did not change the vasorelaxant activity of EAButF (50 μg/mL). Nevertheless, the incubation with tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine significantly influenced the EAButF activity. It was also shown that Ca influx or efflux is not related to EAButF vasorelaxation potential. Kaempferitrin and kaempferol were also able to relax the rat aortic rings in 34.70% and 40.54%, respectively.This study shows, for the first time, the vasorelaxant effect of EAButF from B. forficata leaves, an effect that may be attributed to the modulation of vascular tone through nitric oxide/soluble guanylate cyclase pathway, and potassium channels. The bioactive kaempferitrin and kaempferol seem to be important for the effects observed with the fraction. Finally, preparations obtained from the leaves of B. forficata may be interesting candidates for new or complementary strategies regarding cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Electron microscopy (EM) provides the resolution required to observe changes in fine subcellular structures caused by such physiological and pathological processes, but samples are observed in vacuum. Environmental capsule EM can directly observe cells in a more natural aqueous environment, but the size-limited capsules restrict cell culturability. The recently developed atmospheric scanning electron microscope (ASEM) has an open, 35 mm sample dish, allowing the culture of primary cells, including neurons, on the electron-transparent film window fabricated in its base. The system's inverted scanning electron microscope observes aldehyde-fixed cells or tissues from below through the silicon nitride film; the optical microscope located above allows direct correlation of fluorescence labeling. To observe fixed biological samples, damage due to low dose electron radiation is minimized in three ways. First, knock on damage that pushes out atoms is decreased by the low accelerating voltage of 10-30 kV. Second, increased radical generation due to the decreased acceleration voltage is countered by the addition of a radical scavenger, glucose or ascorbic acid, to the sample solution. Third, the large volume (max. 2 ml) of aqueous buffer surrounding the sample has a high specific heat capacity, minimizing the temperature increase caused by irradiation. Using ASEM, we have developed protocols for heavy metal staining in solution to selectively visualize intracellular structures. Various EM staining methods served as a starting point. Uranyl  preferably stains proteins and nucleic acid, and prior tannic acid treatment enhances membranes. Osmium tetroxide is suggested to enhance lipids, especially oil droplets. Imaging primary-culture neurons stained with platinum blue or uranyl  revealed growth cones, synapses, and 50-500 nm spines, together with neurite backbones and their associated structures. Correlative microscopy with immuno-fluorescence labeling suggested that these were mainly microtubule associated objects; some showed signs of a fission process and were, thus, possibly mitochondria. Liver tissue excised from the ob/ob type 2  model mouse, was stained with osmium tetroxide and observed using ASEM. Swollen bright balls occupied a large area of the cytoplasm and could be distinguished from vacuoles, suggesting that they are oil droplets. In some of the images, oil-like droplets were pressing surrounding structures, including sinusoids, significant for blood circulation in the liver. Based on these studies, ASEM combined with metal staining methods promises to allow the study of various mesoscopic-scale phenomena of cells and tissues immersed in natural aqueous environment in the near future. The quick nature of ASEM could facilitate not only the precise imaging for neuroscience but also the diagnosis of fatty liver disease and related diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Secondly, the anti- effects of the ethyl  extracts of the aerial parts/fruit (EAP/EAF) of P. alkekengi were evaluated in high-fat diet-fed and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (seven groups, n = 7) daily at doses of 300 and 600 mg/kg for 28 days. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) was measured with a glucometer and the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), glycated serum protein (GSP), and fasting insulin (FINS) were measured by ELISA. Furthermore, insulin sensitivity index (ISI) and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) were calculated based on FBG and FINS. Changes in blood glucose concentration were assessed after an oral glucose challenge in diabetic rats treated with EAF and EAP extracts. In all assays, rosiglitazone, a current antidiabetic drug and insulin sensitizer, was also tested. Finally, the compounds in EAP were identified by HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis.EAP increased the uptake of 2-NBDG, a measure of direct glucose uptake, in HepG2 cells. Next, in diabetic rats treated with P. alkegenki extracts for 28 days, the levels of FBG, TC, TG and GSP and were lowered effectively, while FINS was increased significantly. EAP/EAF enhanced insulin sensitivity significantly as measured by ISI and HOMA-IR along with oral glucose tolerance test analysis. The EAP generally exerted the greatest effects. Lastly, a HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS analysis identified 50 compounds, including 26 physalins, 10 flavonoids, and 9 phenolic acids, with 21 compounds found for the first time in P. alkekengi.The results support the merit of P. alkekengi as an antidiabetic herbal medicine or dietary supplement.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A critical attribute of the microbiota is high species diversity, which provides system robustness through overlapping and redundant metabolic capabilities. The gradual loss of bacterial diversity has been associated with a broad array of gut pathologies and diseases including malnutrition, obesity,  and inflammatory bowel disease. We formulated an in silico community model of the gut microbiota by combining genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of 28 representative species to explore the relationship between species diversity and community growth. While the individual species offered a broad range of metabolic capabilities, communities optimized for maximal growth on simulated Western and high-fiber diets had low diversities and imbalances in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis characterized by  overproduction. Community flux variability analysis performed with the 28-species model and a reduced 20-species model suggested that enhanced species diversity and more balanced SCFA production were achievable at suboptimal growth rates. We developed a simple method for constraining species abundances to sample the growth-diversity tradeoff and used the 20-species model to show that tradeoff curves for Western and high-fiber diets resembled Pareto-optimal surfaces. Compared to maximal growth solutions, suboptimal growth solutions were characterized by higher species diversity, more balanced SCFA synthesis and lower exchange rates of crossfed metabolites between more species. We hypothesized that modulation of crossfeeding relationships through host-microbiota interactions could be an important means for maintaining species diversity and suggest that community metabolic modeling approaches that allow multiobjective optimization of growth and diversity are needed for more realistic simulation of complex communities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744084>Antioxidant, α-Amylase and α-Glucosidase Inhibitory Activities and Potential Constituents of  Bark.</a></h2><p>The fruits of  are commonly used as foods and cooking ingredients in Vietnam, Laos, and the southeast region of China, whilst the leaves are traditionally used for treating diarrhea and rheumatism. This study was conducted to investigate the potential use of this plant bark as antioxidants, and α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitors. Five different extracts of  bark (TDB) consisting of the extract (TDBS) and factional extracts hexane (TDBH), ethyl  (TDBE), butanol (TDBB), and water (TDBW) were evaluated. The TDBS extract contained the highest amount of total phenolic (112.14 mg gallic acid equivalent per g dry weight), while the TDBB extract had the most effective antioxidant capacity compared to other extracts. Its IC values were 12.33, 47.87, 33.25, and 103.74 µg/mL in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (ABTS), reducing power (RP), and nitric oxide (NO) assays, respectively. Meanwhile, the lipid peroxidation inhibition of the four above extracts was proximate to that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as a standard antioxidant. The result of porcine pancreatic α-amylase inhibition showed that TDB extracts have promising effects which are in line with the commercial diabetic inhibitor acarbose. Interestingly, the inhibitory ability on α-glucosidase of all the extracts was higher than that of acarbose. Among the extracts, the TDBB extract expressed the strongest activity on the enzymatic reaction (IC = 18.93 µg/mL) followed by the TDBW extract (IC = 25.27 µg/mL), TDBS (IC = 28.17 µg/mL), and TDBE extract (IC = 141.37 µg/mL). The phytochemical constituents of the TDB extract were identified by gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The principal constituents included nine phenolics, eight terpenoids, two steroids, and five compounds belonging to other chemical classes, which were the first reported in this plant. Among them, the presence of α- and β-amyrins were identified by GC-MS and appeared as the most dominant constituents in TDB extracts (1.52 mg/g). The results of this study revealed that  bark possessed rich phenolics and terpenoids, which might confer on reducing risks from .

The aqueous-methanol and ethyl  fractions also significantly ( P < .05) reversed the alterations in oxidative stress markers (GSH, MDA, CAT, and SOD) observed in the diabetic control group. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that the methanol extract of Dacryodes edulis ameliorates hyperglycemia and the associated oxidative stress in STZ-induced diabetic Wistar rats. These observed activities are largely due to the compounds that partitions into the aqueous-methanol (55:45) solvent fraction. This provides scientific evidence for the use of this plant extract in folk medicine and also a baseline data for its further characterization. Further work should be carried out to characterize the aqueous-methanol solvent fractions for the active compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605782>New compounds of Siolmatra brasiliensis and inhibition of in vitro protein glycation damage.</a></h2><p>Twenty compounds were isolated from the hydroethanolic extract of the stems of Siolmatra brasiliensis, five flavonoids, two lignans, one glucosyl phytosterol, seven nor-cucurbitacins, one new phenolic derivative named siolmatrin (1) and four new dammarane-type saponins named siolmatrosides II-V (2-5), the structures of the compounds were assigned by means of 1D and 2D NMR experiments and HRESIMS of the natural compounds and some acetyl derivatives. The effects of the crude hydroethanolic extract (SbExt) and the ethyl  fraction (SbEtAc) of Siolmatra brasiliensis stems on the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) were also investigated. In the in vitro model system of protein glycation using bovine serum albumin (BSA) and glucose, addition of SbExt or SbEtAc inhibited the formation of fluorescent AGEs, in parallel to minor levels of fructosamine (SbEtAc) and markers of tyrosine and tryptophan oxidation (SbExt and SbEtAc). Protein crosslinking, which represents changes of late stages of protein glycation, was reduced in the presence of SbExt and SbEtAc. Siolmatra brasiliensis stems seem to be a promising source of compounds having ability to prevent glycoxidation changes, arising as an interesting option to be studied as a complementary therapy for complications of .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Isaurica (Fabaceae), endemic to the eastern Mediterranean region, is a poorly studied medicinal plant. This study sets out to investigate into antioxidant and inhibitory activities of O. argyrea extracts (ethyl , methanol, and water) against key enzymes linked to  (α-amylase, α-glucosidase), Alzheimer's disease (acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase), and skin hyperpigmentation (tyrosinase). Phytochemical composition was determined by HPLC-DAD and in silico approach used to provide additional insight of the possible interaction of the identified phenolic compounds with the studied enzymes. The methanol extract showed potent inhibitory action against acetylcholinesterase (1.55 mg GALAE/g extract), tyrosinase (61.61 mg KAE/g extract), and glucosidase (20.17 mmol ACAE/g extract). The methanol extract of O. argyrea exhibited potent radical scavenging potential (126.51 mg TE/g extract for DPPH scavenging assay) and reducing capacities (311.36 and 200.70 mg TE/g extract, for CUPRAC and FRAP assays, respectively). Quercetin, apigenin, and benzoic acid were identified in significant amounts in the methanol extract of O. argyrea. Quercetin interacted with the catalytic pocket of glucosidase by establishing hydrogen bonds with Ser157, Ser241, Asp307, and π-π interactions with His280 and Tyr158. The observed inhibitory effects of O. argyrea extracts on the studied enzyme suggest that this plant could be a promising source of naturally occurring chemical compounds for the management of , Alzheimer's disease, skin hyperpigmentation disorders, as well as, oxidative stress-related complications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

There has been an exponential surge in the use of animal models that can mimic different phenotypes of the human intestinal ecosystem. However, data on host species-specific signatures of gut microbiome and its metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; i.e., , propionate, and butyrate) and lactate in these models and their similarities/differences from humans remain limited, due to high variability in protocols and analyses. Here, we analyze the fecal microbiota composition and the fecal levels of SCFAs and lactate in three of the most-widely used animal models, i.e., mice, rats, and non-human primates (NHPs) and compare them with human subjects, using data generated on a single platform with same protocols. The data show several species-specific similarities and differences in the gut microbiota and fecal organic acids between these species groups. Based on β-diversity, the gut microbiota in humans seems to be closer to NHPs than to mice and rats; however, among rodents, mice microbiota appears to be closer to humans than rats. The phylum-level analyses demonstrate higher  ratio in humans and NHPs vs. mice and rats. Human microbiota is dominated by  followed by  and . Mouse gut is predominated by members of the family  followed by those from the order , whereas rats and NHPs have higher abundance of  compared with mice and humans. Also, fecal levels of lactate are higher in mice and rats vs. NHPs and humans, while  is highest in human feces. These data of host species-specific gut microbiota signatures in some of the most widely used animal models in context to the human microbiota might reflect disparities in host factors, e.g., diets, genetic origin, gender and age, and hence call for prospective studies investigating the features of gut microbiome in such animal models by controlling for these host elements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30228829>Inhibition of -Glucosidase, Intestinal Glucose Absorption, and Antidiabetic Properties by .</a></h2><p>Many medicinal plants around the world are used for therapeutic purposes against several diseases, including .

The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant potential of the extracts of leaves of this plant. Methods The crude hydroethanolic extract (HEE) of the leaves of Z. mauritiana and their partitionates in n-hexane, dichloromethane, and ethyl , and in the residual aqueous solution (the F1, F2, F3, and F4 fractions, respectively) were first prepared. The content of polyphenols was determined and the antioxidant effects of the extracts were evaluated by their 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity, inhibition of lipid peroxidation (TBARS), and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Results The HEE as well as the F3 and F4 fractions were rich in polyphenols with contents between 58 and 84 mg equivalent gallic acid per 100 mg. The flavonoid content was 4 mg quercetin equivalents in the HEE and the F4 fraction. Except for the F1 fraction, the HEE and the other fractions showed significant DPPH scavenging activity (IC50 between 8 and 12 μg/mL). The IC50 of TBARS by different extracts was in the range 1-5 μg/mL, and the FRAP activity was 7-85 mg ascorbic acid equivalent per 100 mg. Total polyphenol content was highly correlated with the antioxidant activities. Conclusions The HEE, F3, and F4 fractions were found to be the richest in polyphenols and had the best antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of the extracts of the leaves of Z. mauritiana is due to these polyphenolic compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316568>A New Flavanone as a Potent Antioxidant Isolated from  L.

The main focus of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial property of crude ethyl  (CEA) extract of A. paniculata against E. coli clinical isolates along with molecular docking of 10 different bioactive components from this plant with CTX-M-15.CEA extract was subjected to phytochemical and FTIR analysis. The E. coli isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility through disk-diffusion method to observe their resistance pattern towards different antibiotics. Antibacterial activity and biofilm assay were performed through broth microdilution using a 96-well microplate. CEA extract was further utilized to observe its effect on the expression of a gene encoding CTX-M-15. Finally, in-silico studies were performed where 10 different bioactive compounds from A. paniculata were molecularly docked with CTX-M-15.Phytochemical and FTIR analysis detected the presence of various secondary metabolites and functional groups in CEA extract respectively. Molecular docking provided the number of residues and bond lengths together with a positive docking score. Antibiotic susceptibility showed the multi-drug resistance of all the clinical strains of E. coli. The antibacterial and antibiofilm efficiency of CEA extract (25, 50 and 100 μg/ml) was tested and 100 μg/ml of the extract was more effective in all the strains of E. coli. All 3 ESBL producing strains of E. coli were subjected to gene expression analysis through PCR. Strains treated with 100 μg/ml of the extract showed a downregulation of the gene encoding CTX-M-15 compared to untreated controls.The utilization of CEA extract of A. paniculata proved an economical way of controlling the growth and biofilm formation of ESBL strains of E. coli.

Yet, a systematic H NMR based metabolomics characterisation of most tissues in this animal model has not been published. Here, we provide a systematic organ-specific metabolomics analysis of this widely employed model using NMR spectroscopy.The aim of this study was to characterise the metabolic modulations associated with T2D in db/db mice in 18 relevant biological matrices.High-resolution H-NMR and 2D-NMR spectroscopy were applied to 18 biological matrices of 12 db/db mice (WT control n = 6, db/db = 6) aged 22 weeks, when  is fully established.61 metabolites associated with T2D were identified. Kidney, spleen, eye and plasma were the biological matrices carrying the largest metabolomics modulations observed in established T2D, based on the total number of metabolites that showed a statistical difference between the diabetic and control group in each tissue (16 in each case) and the strength of the O-PLS DA model for each tissue. Glucose and glutamate were the most commonly associated metabolites found significantly increased in nine biological matrices. Investigated sections where no increase of glucose was associated with T2D include all intestinal segments (i.e. duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon). Microbial co-metabolites such as  and butyrate, used as carbon sources by the host, were identified in excess in the colonic tissues of diabetic individuals.The metabolic biomarkers identified using H NMR-based metabolomics will represent a useful resource to explore metabolic pathways involved in T2D in the db/db mouse model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081243>Gut microbiome dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability in children with islet autoimmunity and type 1 : A prospective cohort study.</a></h2><p>To investigate the longitudinal relationship between the gut microbiome, circulating short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and intestinal permeability in children with islet autoimmunity or type 1  and controls.We analyzed the gut bacterial microbiome, plasma SCFAs, small intestinal permeability and dietary intake in 47 children with islet autoimmunity or recent-onset type 1  and in 41 unrelated or sibling controls over a median (range) of 13 (2-34) months follow-up.Children with multiple islet autoantibodies (≥2 IA) or type 1  had gut microbiome dysbiosis.

Previous studies had indicated that the ethyl  extract of  Kitam. leaves (EAEG) exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. In this report, we demonstrated that EAEG possessed potent anticancer activity through autophagy-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation. EAEG induced a strong cytostatic effect towards HeLa cells and, to a lesser extent, HepG2 and MCF-7 cells. This cytostatic effect of EAEG was not a consequence of increased apoptosis, as neither DNA fragmentation nor change in protein expression level for a number of apoptosis-related genes including Bid, Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 was observed after EAEG treatment, and the apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK did not inhibit the EAEG-elicited cytostatic effect. On the other hand, EAEG induced autophagy in a dose-dependent fashion, as shown by increased GFP puncta formation, enhanced conversion of the microtubule-associated protein light chain LC3-I to LC3-II, and downregulation of the p62 protein. Treating the HeLa cells with EAEG together with Chloroquine (CQ) further accelerated LC3 conversion and p62 clearance, indicating that EAEG induced complete autophagy flux. Importantly, the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3MA) significantly abrogated the cytostatic effect of EAEG, strongly suggesting that EAEG inhibited HeLa cell proliferation through the induction of autophagy rather than apoptosis. Our results provided a novel and interesting mechanistic insight into the anticancer action of EAEG, supporting the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of the cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30013435>Pregnancy outcomes of women who received conservative therapy for endometrial carcinoma or atypical endometrial hyperplasia.</a></h2><p>Approximately 3%-25% of cases of endometrial carcinoma (EC) or atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AH) occur in women aged <40 years and conservative treatment with high-dose medroxyprogesterone  (MPA) is administered to women who wish to preserve their fertility.

Gut microbiota may play a regulatory role in gastrointestinal health, substrate metabolism, and peripheral tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver, and pancreas via its metabolites short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Animal and human data demonstrated that, in particular,  beneficially affects host energy and substrate metabolism via secretion of the gut hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY, which, thereby, affects appetite, via a reduction in whole-body lipolysis, systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and via an increase in energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Thus, potential therapies to increase gut microbial fermentation and  production have been under vigorous scientific scrutiny. In this review, the relevance of the colonically and systemically most abundant SCFA  and its effects on the previously mentioned tissues will be discussed in relation to body weight control and glucose homeostasis. We discuss in detail the differential effects of oral  administration (vinegar intake), colonic  infusions, acetogenic fiber, and acetogenic probiotic administrations as approaches to combat obesity and comorbidities.

This study aimed to investigate whether metformin regulates atrial SK2 and SK3 protein expression in T2DM rats though the protein kinase C (PKC)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway.A T2DM rat model was established using a high-fat and high-sugar diet combined with a low-dose intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). The rats were randomly divided into the following five groups: the control group, the untreated T2DM group, the metformin-treated only group, the phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA; a PKC agonist administered by intraperitoneal injection) treatment group, and the recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rh-EGF; an ERK agonist administered by tail vein injection) treatment group. The activity of PKC in atrial tissues was assayed by a PKC kinase activity assay kit. The protein expression of SK2, SK3, and phosphorylated ERK (pERK) were determined by western blotting and immunohistochemistry.Compared with the Control group, atrial PKC activity and pERK and SK3 protein expression were increased, while SK2 protein expression was decreased in atrial tissues of T2DM rats. Eight weeks of metformin treatment inhibited the PKC activity and pERK and SK3 expression, and elevated SK2 expression compared with the T2DM group. Compared with the metformin-treated only group, the injection of rh-EGF increased pERK and SK3 expression, and decreased SK2 expression; the injection of PMA increased PKC activity and SK3 expression, and decreased SK2 expression. In addition, the injection with PMA significantly elevated the expression of pERK.The PKC/ERK signaling pathway is involved in the downregulation of SK2 expression and the upregulation of SK3 expression in the atrium of T2DM rats. Long-term metformin treatment prevents the SK2 downregulation and the SK3 upregulation through inhibiting the PKC/ERK signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564549>PRDM16 Maintains Homeostasis of the Intestinal Epithelium by Controlling Region-Specific Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Metabolic pathways dynamically regulate tissue development and maintenance. However, the mechanisms that govern the metabolic adaptation of stem or progenitor cells to their local niche are poorly understood. Here, we define the transcription factor PRDM16 as a region-specific regulator of intestinal metabolism and epithelial renewal. PRDM16 is selectively expressed in the upper intestine, with enrichment in crypt-resident progenitor cells. Acute Prdm16 deletion in mice triggered progenitor apoptosis, leading to diminished epithelial differentiation and severe intestinal atrophy. Genomic and metabolic analyses showed that PRDM16 transcriptionally controls fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in crypts. Expression of this PRDM16-driven FAO program was highest in the upper small intestine and declined distally. Accordingly, deletion of Prdm16 or inhibition of FAO selectively impaired the development and maintenance of upper intestinal enteroids, and these effects were rescued by  treatment. Collectively, these data reveal that regionally specified metabolic programs regulate intestinal maintenance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Corn silk is a traditional medicine used to treat DM. The aim of this study is to investigate the antioxidant capacity of corn silk, as well as its inhibitory potential on DM and diabetic nephropathy (DN). The ethanol extract of corn silk (CS) was liquid-liquid fractionated to get petroleum ether fraction (PCS), ethyl  fraction (ECS), n-butanol fraction (BCS) and water fraction (WCS). The Folin-Ciocalteu and AlCl assay showed that silk corn contained considerable amount of phenolics and flavonoids, ECS and BCS were the two phenolic-enriched fractions with highest TPC and TFC values. The ECS and BCS showed the highest total antioxidant activity and reducing power, as well as the strongest scavenging activity against DPPH and hydroxyl radicals, compared to CS and other fractions. The ECS and BCS displayed appreciable anti-hyperglycaemic effect indicated by the significant inhibition on α-amylase and α-glucosidase in enzymatic assays. In BSA-glucose model, ECS and BCS effectively inhibited the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). In addition, the anti-diabetic nephropathy activity assay displayed that CS, ECS and BCS significantly inhibited the production of Col IV, FN and IL-6 in high-glucose stimulated mesangial cells at 200 μg/mL. These findings suggested the antioxidant activities of corn silk could contribute, at least in part, to its traditionally claimed therapeutic benefits on DM and DN. The phenolic-enriched CS fractions could be considered as a source of natural antioxidants and further developed for the prevention and treatment of DM and its complications including DN.Copyright © 2018.

The UV detector was set at 269nm. The method was validated according to FDA guidelines. The present method showed good linearity (R=0.9998) from 0.1 to 2.0µg/ml standards, with a limit of detection 0.1 µg/ml. Intra-day accuracy and precision in terms of %CV (range: 93.33% to 100.4% and 3.8% to 9.2%) and interday accuracy and precision (range: 94.1% to 102.7% and 4.8% to 9.6%) were in agreement with FDA guidelines. Freeze thaw stability showed that the plasma samples could be stored for one month at -20oC without any appreciable degradation. The present method was successfully applied to the blood samples obtained from one volunteer after oral administration of 30 mg pioglitazone tablet.

Upon stimulation, they are able to decondense and release their chromatin as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). This process (NETosis) is part of immune defense mechanisms but also plays an important role in many chronic and inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, , and cancer. For this reason, much effort has been invested into understanding biochemical signaling pathways in NETosis. However, the impact of the mechanical micro-environment and adhesion on NETosis is not well-understood. Here, we studied how adhesion and especially substrate elasticity affect NETosis. We employed polyacrylamide (PAA) gels with distinctly defined elasticities (Young's modulus  within the physiologically relevant range from 1 to 128 kPa and coated the gels with integrin ligands (collagen I, fibrinogen). Neutrophils were cultured on these substrates and stimulated with potent inducers of NETosis: phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Interestingly, PMA-induced NETosis was neither affected by substrate elasticity nor by different integrin ligands. In contrast, for LPS stimulation, NETosis rates increased with increasing substrate elasticity ( > 20 kPa). LPS-induced NETosis increased with increasing cell contact area, while PMA-induced NETosis did not require adhesion at all. Furthermore, inhibition of phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase (PI3K), which is involved in adhesion signaling, completely abolished LPS-induced NETosis but only slightly decreased PMA-induced NETosis. In summary, we show that LPS-induced NETosis depends on adhesion and substrate elasticity while PMA-induced NETosis is completely independent of adhesion.Copyright © 2019 Erpenbeck, Gruhn, Kudryasheva, Günay, Meyer, Busse, Neubert, Schön, Rehfeldt and Kruss.</p></html>
