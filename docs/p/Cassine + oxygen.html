Such mediators contribute to oxidative stress and alter inflammatory processes in adipose tissue, leading to insulin resistance during obesity. Thus, the identification of natural compounds such as plant polyphenols able to increase the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity of the body is of high interest. We aimed to evaluate the biological properties of polyphenol-rich extracts from the medicinal plants A. borbonica, D. apetalum and G. mauritiana on preadipocytes exposed to H2O2, TNFα or LPS mediators.Medicinal plant extracts were analysed for their polyphenol contents by Folin-Ciocalteu and UPLC-ESI-MS methods as well as for their free radical-scavenging activities by DPPH and ORAC assays. To assess the ability of polyphenol-rich extracts to protect 3T3-L1 preadipocytes against H2O2, TNFα or LPS mediators, several parameters including cell viability (MTT and LDH assays), ROS production (DCFH-DA test), IL-6 and MCP-1 secretion (ELISA) were evaluated. Moreover, the expression of superoxide dismutase, catalase and NF-κB genes was explored (RT-QPCR).All medicinal plants exhibited high levels of polyphenols with free radical-scavenging capacities. Flavonoids such as quercetin, kaempferol, epicatechin and procyanidins, and phenolic acids derived from caffeic acid including chlorogenic acid, were detected. Polyphenol-rich plant extracts did not exert a cytotoxic effect on preadipocytes but protected them against H2O2 anti-proliferative action. Importantly, they down-regulated ROS production and the secretion of IL-6 and MCP-1 pro-inflammatory markers induced by H2O2, TNFα and LPS mediators. Such a protective action was associated with an increase in superoxide dismutase antioxidant enzyme gene expression and a decrease in mRNA levels of NF-κB pro-inflammatory transcription factor.This study highlights that antioxidant strategies based on polyphenols derived from medicinal plants tested could contribute to regulate adipose tissue redox status and immune process, and thus participate to the improvement of obesity-related oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14170145>THE VASCULAR RESISTANCE OF THE FOETAL AND NEWLY VENTILATED LUNG OF THE LAMB.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18722986>Low community photosynthetic quotient in coral reef sediments.</a></h2><p>Fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon and  at the water-sediment interface were measured at eight coral reef stations (Indian Ocean) in summer and winter. The dark fluxes provided the community respiratory quotient (CRQ = dissolved inorganic carbon release /  uptake) and the diurnal fluxes corrected from the dark fluxes gave the community photosynthetic quotient (CPQ =  gross release / dissolved inorganic carbon gross uptake). The CRQ and the winter CPQ were not significantly different from 1. Summer CPQ (0.79; SD 0.02) was significantly lower than 1 due to the combined effect of the daily evolution of the community respiration and the discrepancy between the daily evolution in community  respiration and community carbon respiration. These results highlight the importance of measuring simultaneously the benthic community production and respiration for long term integrated data sets, instead of the traditional daily or seasonal budget calculations from limited measures of community respiration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2309050>The role of lung perfusate PO2 in the control of the pulmonary vascular resistance of exteriorized fetal lambs.</a></h2><p>The isolated perfused lower left lung lobe of the exteriorized fetal lamb was used to define quantitatively the relationship between pulmonary perfusate  tension and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in the fetus at multiple  tensions over the range from 8.3 to 433 mm Hg. This allowed variation of the perfusate PO2 over the range of partial pressures from less than 10 mm Hg to over 400 mm Hg while constant values of PCO2, temperature and perfusate flow were maintained. In all animals, calculated pulmonary vascular resistance varied in an inverse manner with the perfusate PO2. The relationship between PVR and perfusate  tension is described by the equation: PVR = 7.67 - 1.54 (log PO2) R2 = 0.70. While others have shown that a single, large increase in blood  tension will decrease the PVR in fetal lambs, these data present the first quantitative description of the role of  tension in the modulation of fetal pulmonary vascular resistance as determined at multiple perfusate  tensions over a fifty-fold range.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23103716>Dietary polyphenols preconditioning protects 3T3-L1 preadipocytes from mitochondrial alterations induced by oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Numerous studies indicate that an increase in reactive  species (ROS) significantly affects white adipose tissue biology and leads to an inflammatory profile and insulin resistance, which could contribute to obesity-associated diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Mitochondria play a key role in adipose tissue energy metabolism and constitute the main source of cellular ROS such as H(2)O(2). Polyphenols constitute the most abundant antioxidants provided by the human diet. Indeed, they are widely distributed in fruits, vegetables and some plant-derived beverages such as coffee and tea. Thus, the biological effects of dietary polyphenols that may increase the antioxidant capacity of the body against obesity-induced oxidative stress are of high interest. Here, we studied the capacity of polyphenols to modulate the impact of oxidative stress on the mitochondria of preadipocytes, which are important cells governing the adipose tissue development for energy homeostasis. Whereas H(2)O(2) treatment induces a proliferation arrest associated with an increase in mitochondrial content in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, preconditioning with some major dietary polyphenols totally or partially protects the cells against oxidative stress consequences.

Indeed, the nature and extent of the intermolecular contacts developed in such a species may play a role on its stability and, hence, on the overall association rate. To find the binding intermediate, a molecular simulation protocol was used to unbind the ligand by gradually decreasing the biasing forces introduced. The intermediate was subsequently refined with 17 independent stochastic boundary molecular dynamics simulations that provide a consistent picture of the intermediate state. In this state, the core region of the ligand remains stable, notably because of the two anchoring  atoms that correspond to recurrent motifs found in all FKBP12 ligand core structures. Besides, the non-core regions participate in numerous transient intermolecular and intramolecular contacts. The dynamic aspect of most of the contacts seems important both for the ligand to retain at least a part of its configurational entropy and for avoiding a trapped state along the binding pathway. Since the transient and anchoring contacts contribute to increasing the stability of the intermediate, as a corollary, the dissociation rate constant [Formula: see text] of this intermediate should be decreased, resulting in an increase of the affinity constant [Formula: see text]. The present results support our previous conclusions and provide a coherent rationale for explaining the prevalence in high-affinity ligands of (i) the two  atoms found in carbonyl or sulfonyl groups of dissimilar core structures and of (ii) symmetric or pseudo-symmetric mobile groups of atoms found as non-core moieties. Another interesting aspect of the intermediate is the distortion of the flexible 80 s loop of the protein, mainly in its tip region, that promotes the accessibility to the bound state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8795107>Nitric oxide inhalation: effects on the ovine neonatal pulmonary and systemic circulations.</a></h2><p>Others have shown that inhaled nitric oxide causes reversal of pulmonary hypertension in anaesthetized perinatal sheep. The present study examined haemodynamic responses to inhaled NO in the normal and constricted pulmonary circulation of unanaesthetized newborn lambs. Three experiments were conducted on each of 7 lambs. First, to determine a minimum concentration of NO which could reverse acute pulmonary hypertension caused by infusion of the thromboxame mimic U46619, the haemodynamic effects of 5 different doses of inhaled NO were examined. Second, the effects of inhaling 80 ppm NO during hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction were examined. Finally, to determine if tachyphalaxis occurs during NO inhalation, lambs were exposed to 80 ppm NO for 3 h during which time pulmonary arterial pressure was doubled by infusion of U46619. Breathing NO (80 ppm) caused a slight but significant decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in lambs with normal pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP). Nitric oxide, inhaled at concentrations between 10 and 80 ppm for 6 min (F1O2 = 0.60), caused decreases in PVR when PAP was elevated with U46619. Nitric oxide acted selectively on the pulmonary circulation, i.e. no changes occurred in systemic arterial pressure or any other measured variable. Breathing 80 ppm NO for 6 min reversed hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. In the chronic exposure study, inhaling 80 ppm NO for 3 h completely reversed U46619-induced pulmonary hypertension. Although arterial methaemoglobin increased during the 3-h exposure to 80 ppm NO, there was no indication that this concentration of NO impairs  loading. These data demonstrate that NO, at concentrations as low as 10 ppm, is a potent, rapid-action, and selective pulmonary vasodilator in unanaesthetized newborn lambs with elevated pulmonary tone. Furthermore, these data support the use of inhaled NO for treatment of infants with pulmonary hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18019>Effects of increased intracranial pressure on pulmonary vascular resistance of fetal and neonatal goats.</a></h2><p>The effects of increased intracranial pressure on the pulmonary circulation were investigated in fetal and neonatal goats. Pulmonary vascular resistance and systemic arterial pressure increased with elevation of intracranial pressure in neonatal animals. Alpha-adrenergic blockade completely eliminated both of these responses. The response of the fetal pulmonary circulation was unlike that seen in the postnatal animal. Although there was a slight elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance initially, the predominant response was a decrease in resistance. The decrease in fetal pulmonary vascular resistance was unaffected by phenoxybenzamine, but reversed by propranolol. After the beta-adrenergic blockade, increased intracranial pressure produced an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. Similarly, ventilation of fetal lungs resulted in an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance after increased intracranial pressure. These results demonstrate for the first time that pulmonary vascular resistance may be altered in fetal and neonatal animals by increasing intracranial pressure. The elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance after elevated intracranial pressure must be due to an active pulmonary vascular constriction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7555121>Nitric oxide administration using constant-flow ventilation.</a></h2><p>Nitric oxide (NO) gas is known as both a vasodilator and a toxin. It can react with  to form compounds more toxic than itself, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The reactions are time dependent; thus, infusing NO into breathing circuits as close to ventilated subjects as possible may help minimize toxic byproduct exposure. Unfortunately, flow rates commonly used with mechanical ventilation favor laminar gas flow (streaming) within the breathing circuits. Streaming could delay mixing of NO with other inhaled gases. This mixing delay may interfere with accurate monitoring and/or delivery of NO. We tested the hypothesis that streaming of NO infused by constant flow into the inspiratory limb of a constant-flow mechanical ventilation system can lead to NO concentration delivery estimate errors. We then compared the NO2 concentrations at the ventilator Y-piece with three different NO mixing methods: blending the gases before they reach the breathing circuit inspiratory limb, infusing NO directly into the breathing circuit inspiratory limb far enough from the Y-piece to ensure thorough mixing, and infusing NO directly into the breathing circuit inspiratory limb immediately before the gases reach an in-line mixing device placed close to the Y-piece. Our results indicate that streaming can lead to NO concentration delivery estimate errors and that these errors can be characterized by measuring NO concentration variations across the inspiratory tubing's luminal diameter. NO2 concentration measured at the ventilator Y-piece were dependent on NO concentrations (p < 0.0001), NO delivery methods (p < 0.0001), and interactions between NO concentrations and NO delivery methods (p < 0.0001). We conclude that gas streaming and toxic byproduct exposure should be considered together when choosing an NO delivery method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6438033>Perinatal pulmonary responses to arachidonic acid during normoxia and hypoxia.</a></h2><p>Dilator prostaglandins are released from the perinatal lung in response to ventilation and also may be involved in the pressor response to hypoxia. However, arachidonic acid, precursor of bisenoic prostaglandins, causes pulmonary vasoconstriction when infused into the pulmonary circulation of perinatal goats. The effects of hypoxia on the arachidonic acid-induced increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were evaluated in ventilated fetal and neonatal lambs using an in situ pump-perfused lower left lobe preparation. These studies indicate that pulmonary vascular effects in newborns due to arachidonic acid are not altered by hypoxia. In contrast, ventilated fetuses show a greater response to arachidonic acid infused during hypoxia than during normoxia. However, this increase in PVR is merely additive to the hypoxic pressor response; thus, hypoxia does not appear to affect the actions of exogenous arachidonic acid in the perinatal pulmonary circulation. The decrease in systemic arterial pressure seen with arachidonic acid infusion is greater at the termination of the combined infusion and hypoxia than after infusion alone. This systemic hypotension is also of longer duration and may indicate a greater release of dilator prostaglandins from the lung following hypoxia and arachidonic acid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30063998>Antiplasmodial, anti-chikungunya virus and antioxidant activities of 64 endemic plants from the Mascarene Islands.</a></h2><p>Vector-borne diseases cause more than 1 million deaths annually. The research into new medicines is urgent, especially as there is currently no specific treatment. In this study, the authors have selected 64 endemic plants from the Mascarene Islands based on their endemism, their medicinal use and their registration in the French Pharmacopeia to evaluate the antiplasmodial, anti-chikungunya and antioxidant activities. The list of these 64 plants including their local name, population, data of collection and voucher number are available in the Supporting Information. Forty active extracts were identified from the 38 species: 22 responded positively to the antiplasmodial activity, 8 to the anti-chikungunya activity and 8 to the antioxidant activity. Six plants demonstrated high antiplasmodial activity (concentration inhibiting 50% of parasitic growth (IC) <5 µg/mL): Casearia coriaceae, Monimia rotundifolia, Poupartia borbonica, Psiadia retusa, Vernonia fimbrillifera and Zanthoxylum heterophyllum; and five showed high anti-chikungunya activity (IC<20 µg/mL): Aphloia theiformis, Stillingia lineata, Croton mauritianus, Indigofera ammoxylum, and Securinega durissima. Eight plants displayed an important antioxidant activity, with values of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) or  Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) >2000 µM of Trolox equivalent per mg/mL of extract: Bertiera borbonica, Erythroxylon laurifolium, Erythroxylon sideroxyloides, I. ammoxylum, P. borbonica, Scolopia heterophylla, Sophora denudata, and Terminalia bentzoe. Some data obtained tend to corroborate the reported traditional use of the plant, such as Z. heterophyllum (antiplasmodial), A. theiformis (anti-chikungunya), and E. laurifolium (antioxidant).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Circulation to the lower left lobe of the fetal lung was isolated in situ and perfused at constant flow with blood withdrawn from the inferior vena cava. Injection of graded doses of ET-1 into the left pulmonary artery decreased pulmonary arterial perfusion pressure in a dose-related manner. At doses of 100, 300, and 1,000 ng, pulmonary vascular resistance per kilogram body weight (PVR/kg) was decreased 30, 40, and 42%, respectively. However, when fetuses were ventilated with 100% , 100- and 300-ng doses of ET-1 decreased PVR/kg by 5 and 9%, respectively. In contrast, injection of 1,000 ng of ET-1 resulted in a reversal of the response, and PVR/kg was increased by 70%. Ventilation of the right lung alone resulted in a similar reversal of the vasodilator response to 1,000 ng of ET-1, and a 138% increase in PVR/kg was recorded. These studies demonstrate for the first time that ET-1 has vasodilator activity in the normally high-tone ovine fetal pulmonary circulation. In addition, these results show that ET-1 has vasoconstrictor activity in the newly ventilated low-tone pulmonary vasculature. The present data indicate the pulmonary vascular responses to ET-1 are tone dependent in the ovine fetal pulmonary circulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/961866>Maturation of contractile response of ductus arteriosus to  and drugs.</a></h2><p>Contractile responses of rings of ductus arteriosus from fetal and neonatal guinea pigs were studied in buffered Krebs-Henseleit solutions of various  tensions. -induced contraction of ductus arteriosus increased with gestational age, peaking at term and attenuating within 24 h after birth.

Albumin, the major circulating protein in blood, can undergo increased glycoxidation in diabetes. Protein glycoxidation can lead to the formation of advanced glycoxidation end products, which induce various deleterious effects on cells. Herein, we report the effect of glucose or methylglyoxal-induced oxidative modifications on BSA or HSA protein structures and on THP1 monocyte physiology. The occurrence of oxidative modifications was found to be enhanced in glycoxidized BSA and HSA, after determination of their free thiol group content, relative electrophoretic migration, carbonyl content, and antioxidant activities. Cells treated with glycoxidized albumin exhibited an overgeneration of intracellular reactive  species, impairments in proteasomal activities, enhancements in RAGE expression, and an accumulation of carbonylated proteins. These novel observations made in the presence of a range of modified BSA and HSA facilitate the comparison of the glycoxidation extent of albumin with the oxidative stress induced in cultured monocytes. Finally, this study reconfirms the influence of experimental conditions in which AGEs are generated and the concentration levels in experiments designed to mimic pathological conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29372063>Production of  biomass on sugarcane distillery wastewater: physiological aspects and potential for biodiesel production.</a></h2><p>Sugarcane distillery waste water (SDW) or vinasse is the residual liquid waste generated during sugarcane molasses fermentation and alcohol distillation. Worldwide, this effluent is responsible for serious environmental issues. In Reunion Island, between 100 and 200 thousand tons of SDW are produced each year by the three local distilleries. In this study, the potential of  to reduce the pollution load of SDW and to produce interesting metabolites has been investigated.The fungal biomass yield was 35 g L corresponding to a yield of 0.47 g of biomass/g of vinasse without nutrient complementation. Analysis of sugar consumption indicated that mono-carbohydrates were initially released from residual polysaccharides and then gradually consumed until complete exhaustion. The high biomass yield likely arises from polysaccharides that are hydrolysed prior to be assimilated as monosaccharides and from organic acids and other complex compounds that provided additional C-sources for growth. Comparison of the size exclusion chromatography profiles of raw and pre-treated vinasse confirmed the conversion of humic- and/or phenolic-like molecules into protein-like metabolites. As a consequence, chemical  demand of vinasse decreased by 53%. Interestingly, analysis of intracellular lipids of the biomass revealed high content in oleic acid and physical properties relevant for biodiesel application.The soft-rot fungus  demonstrated a great ability to grow on vinasse and to degrade this complex and hostile medium. The high biomass production is accompanied by a utilization of carbon sources like residual carbohydrates, organic acids and more complex molecules such as melanoidins. We also showed that intracellular lipids from fungal biomass can efficiently be exploited into biodiesel.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7700732>The effects of nitric oxide inhalation on the pulmonary circulation of preterm lambs.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to test the hypothesis that inhalation of nitric oxide by lambs delivered prematurely would result in increased systemic arterial blood  tension and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance. Eleven premature fetal lambs were delivered by cesarean section at 126-127 d gestation. One hundred min after the onset of ventilation, nitric oxide gas was added to the lambs' breathing mixture. The animals were exposed in random order to 5 ppm for 10 min, 20 ppm for 10 min, and 20 ppm for 20 min. Each treatment period was preceded by and followed by a 10-min washout period. When compared with the washout (control) periods, all three treatment periods resulted in an improvement in both the systemic arterial blood  tension and the physiologic intrapulmonary shunt. Inhalation of nitric oxide also resulted in a selective decrease in pulmonary arterial blood pressure. Comparisons between the different treatment groups revealed a further improvement in blood oxygenation and pulmonary hemodynamics when using the higher concentration of nitric oxide. Interestingly, the rise in arterial blood oxygenation continued after inhaling 20 ppm nitric oxide for more than 10 min.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15798803>Stratospheric temperature monitoring using a vibrational Raman lidar. Part 1: aerosols and ozone interferences.</a></h2><p>Lidar measurements of temperature for the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere are commonly derived by the Raman technique. Lidar signals derived from vibrational Raman processes have been subjected to numerous simulation tests to examine their sensitivity to the presence of aerosols and ozone in the atmosphere. The influence of aerosols characteristics (wavelength dependence of aerosol extinction and particle phase function) and of ozone concentration on Raman temperature profiles is estimated. Simulations indicate large temperature deviations for post-volcanic conditions. For a Raman backscatter at 607 nm, bias is below 1 K for a total optical depth less than 9 x 10(-3) in the case of a stratospheric contamination and less than 6 x 10(-3) for a tropospheric contamination. The effect of aerosols depends on phase function and a few parameters such as altitude, optical depth and the shape of the high-altitude cloud. The wavelength dependence of aerosol extinction has some influence only for severe post-volcanic conditions (Scattering Ratio, SR >2). For a Raman backscatter at 387 nm, bias is larger and can be significant even in background aerosol conditions. Changes in the ozone density profile lead to significant Raman temperature deviations only for some specific conditions. Results suggest that both aerosol and ozone corrections are necessary to obtain an accuracy better than the 1 K requested for most atmospheric applications.</p></html>
