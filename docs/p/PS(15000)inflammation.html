The aim of our study was to assess whether plasma markers of  increased after exercise in patients with PAD. The study was conducted on two groups of 20 subjects each: one group (mean age 68.4 +/- 5.09 years) was affected by PAD with claudication, while the other group consisted of healthy controls (66.9 +/- 6.1 years). Concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) were determined in plasma, in supernatants and in cells stimulated with 1 mg lipopolysaccharide in all patients. E-selectin (ES), L-selectin (LS) and P-selectin () concentrations and plasma concentrations of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were also determined. All determinations were performed in patients at rest and after the treadmill exercise. Resting values of soluble mediators were greater in PAD patients than in controls. They increased in both groups after the treadmill test, even if post-treadmill concentrations were significantly higher in PAD patients (PAD p < .001 or .0001, controls p < .05 or .001). These results confirm that white blood cell activation is characteristic of systemic atherosclerosis and that these  markers increase in conditions of hemodynamic stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20926496>Polymorphisms of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 gene and peripheral artery disease.</a></h1><p>Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) is a key regulator of angiogenesis and is involved in , which are two important features of the pathogenesis of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The gene for the HIF1-alpha subunit (HIF1A) carries two common mis-sense mutations, P582S (C>T, rs11549465) and A588T (G>A, rs11549467), which both have been related to increased trans-activation capacity of HIF1-alpha. The aim of the present study was to analyze the role of these polymorphisms in PAD. The study was designed as a case-control study including 917 patients with documented PAD and 969 control subjects. HIF1A genotypes were determined by exonuclease (TaqMan) assays. HIF1A P582S genotype frequencies were not significantly different between PAD patients (PP 82.2%;  16.5%; SS 1.3%) and control subjects (83.2%; .3%; 1.5%; p = .72). Similarly, HIF1A A588T genotype frequencies did not differ significantly between PAD patients (AA 95.9%; AT 4.1%) and control subjects (AA 96.8%; AT 3.2%; p = .28). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis including age, sex, smoking, diabetes, arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, neither the HIF1A P582S polymorphism (odds ratio: 1.26; 95% confidence interval .92-1.74; p = .16) nor the A588T polymorphism (odds ratio: 1.17; 95% confidence interval .59-2.35; p = .66) was significantly associated with the presence of PAD. Both polymorphisms were furthermore not associated with age at onset of PAD, Fontaine stage of the disease or the ankle/brachial index of patients. We conclude that functional polymorphisms in the HIF1A gene do not contribute to susceptibility to PAD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2612447>Effect of lung collapse on alveolar surfactant in rabbits subjected to unilateral pneumothorax.</a></h1><p>To determine whether atelectasis might modify lung surfactant, we injected N2 into the right pleural space of adult rabbits. Daily, under sedation, pleural gas volume and pressure were measured and adjusted to 20 ml/kg and  to +2 cm H2O with N2. On the sixth day, pHa, PaCO2, PaO2, and FRC were measured. Pressure-volume diagrams or bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were performed separately on right and left lungs. Surfactant subfractions were obtained from BAL fluid, and total protein, LDH, and cell counts were determined. Phospholipid (PL) was assayed in lung homogenate, BAL fluid, and subfractions, and PL composition was determined on the largest BAL subfraction (P4). On the sixth day the pleural gas volume was 19.7 +/- 2.7 (SD) ml/kg, and PaO2 and FRC were significantly decreased. Air volume in excised right lungs at 30 cm H2O was 13.1 +/- 2.8 (SE) ml/kg with pneumothorax (PN) and 22.8 +/- 1.9 (SE) ml/kg in controls. Total PL was decreased 43% in BAL and 59% in P4 of collapsed lungs. Phosphatidylglycerol to phosphatidylinositol (PI) plus phosphatidylserine () ratio of P4 was substantially decreased in both lungs of PN animals. Cell counts, LDH, and protein in BAL did not suggest inflammation or epithelial damage. We conclude that pneumothorax decreases the quantity of alveolar surfactant in the collapsed lung and alters its phospholipid composition toward the fetal pattern in both lungs, possibly due in part to the proliferative response of the lungs to pneumothorax.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26345866>Effect of phosphatidylserine on memory in patients and rats with Alzheimer's disease.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of phosphatidylserine () on memory of patients and rats with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In total, 57 AD patients were recruited from our hospital, and were divided into two groups: 25 in the control group and 32 in the observation group. Next, 300 mg/d of  was given to the rats in the observation group for 12 continuous weeks based on the control group. AD rats were divided into three groups: control group,  30 mg/kg group, and   mg/kg group. Learning memory ability and free radical levels in the brain were detected after treatment. In AD patients, vocabulary and picture matching scores in the two treatment groups increased after treatment (P < .05). Moreover, the scores in the treated group were significantly greater than the control group (P < .05). In AD rats,  treatment reduced the escape latent period of AD rats, increased SOD and OH(-), and decreased acetylcholinesterase levels (P < .05). Compared with   mg/kg,  30 mg/kg group was significantly more efficacious (P < .05). Compared with the AD model group, hippocampal cells showed normal arrangement, karyopyknosis decreased, and the pathological changes in the two  groups were considerable. In conclusion,  decreased cholinesterase, improved memory, and improved hippocampal  injury in AD brains by increasing SOD and OH(-) levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26710892>Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy as an alternative to systemic antibiotics: results from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical study on type 2 diabetics.</a></h1><p>This double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study compared multiple applications of the antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) treatment protocol, to systemic doxycycline as adjuvant to scaling and root planing (SRP) on type 2 diabetic patients on clinical, systemic and immune-inflammatory outcomes.Thirty patients with Hba1c >7% were allocated in two groups, SRP + Doxy (n = ) using systemic doxycycline 100 mg/day (14 days) and SRP + aPDT (n = ) with multiple applications (, 3, 7 and 14 days). Primary outcome was glycated haemoglobin levels (HbA1c). Clinical parameters: plaque score (), bleeding on probe, probing depth, suppuration, gingival recession, and clinical attachment level, percentage of pockets with desired clinical endpoint were measured at baseline and 3 months after therapy. Cytokine profile was assessed at , 1 and 3 month to measure IL1-β, TNF-α and TGF-β on gingival crevicular fluid.No significant difference was detected on HbA1c, between treatments. The SRP + aPDT group showed advantage on reducing moderate pockets in single-rooted teeth at 3 months. SRP + aPDT presented better results at 3 months on IL1-β levels. There were no significant differences between TNF-α and TGF-β.Both treatments improved clinical and systemic outcomes (Hba1c). SRP + aPDT performed better in moderate probing pocket depth on single-rooted teeth, reduced favourably  in short term, and may be an alternative to systemic antibiotics.

We aimed to measure concentrations of 8-isoprostane (8-IsoP) in the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and exhaled nitric oxide (FE) in patients with SBD and healthy children, in order to assess the relationship between these two biomarkers, disease severity, and overnight changes.Patients with SDB (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 20) aged 4.5-.1 years (M/F: 36/30) underwent exhaled measurements. Patients with SDB underwent standard polysomnography to define primary snoring (: AHI < 1) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Upon awakening the following morning, FE was measured and EBC was collected for the measurement of EBC 8-IsoP.OSA patients yielded higher awakening levels of 8-IsoP in EBC than  patients and control subjects. The 8-IsoP levels, though not FE, correlated with AHI (r = .40, p = .003) and SaO2 (r = -.50, p = .001). Cut-off levels of 8-IsoP predicted OSA with a high AUC value (.84, p = .000). Sensitivity and specificity for 8-IsoP levels above the percentile 50 (33.3 pg/mL) were 76.5% and 78.1%, respectively. 8-IsoP levels did not change from the evening to morning session, whereas morning FE levels rose significantly only in patients with mild OSA (p = .03).Levels of 8-IsoP, though not FE, distinguish children with OSA from those with  or healthy, correlate with disease severity and closely predict OSA in the whole sample.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In the study, 24 female and 24 male adult Wistar-Albino rats were divided into five groups: (1) the non-wounded group having no incision wounds, (2) the control group having incision wounds, (3) the TENS (2 Hz,  min) group, (4) the physiological saline () group and (5) the povidone iodine (PI) group. In the skin sections, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were assessed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemical methods. In the non-wounded group, the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α signaling molecules was weaker in the whole tissue; however, in the control group, significant inflammatory response occurred, and strong cytokine expression was observed in the dermis, granulation tissue, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands (P < .05). In the TENS group, the decrease in TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 immunoreaction in the skin was significant compared to the other forms of treatment (P < .05). Distinctive decreases of pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in the dermis in the TENS group suggest that TENS shortened the healing process by inhibating the  phase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29402840>Elevations of Thrombotic Biomarkers in Hemoglobin H Disease.</a></h1><p>Thalassemia is a group of hereditary hemoglobinopathies caused by decreased or absent synthesis of α and/or β globin chains. Studies have shown that hypercoagulability and thrombosis are common clinical symptoms in β-thalassemia, especially β-thalassemia intermedia, but little is known about in α-thalassemia. This study aims to examine phosphatidylserine () levels, platelet activation, and coagulation markers in splenectomized (S) and nonsplenectomy (NS) patients with hemoglobin (Hb) H disease.The NS group comprised 20 patients (median age . years, range, 14-16.5 years), and the S group consisted of 11 patients (median age 16.4 years, range, 14-19.9 years) with Hb H disease; the control group consisted of 20 normal subjects. Hematological parameters were collected. Flow cytometry was used to measure  exposure on red blood cells. The levels of intercellular adhesive molecule (ICAM)-1, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), β-thromboglobulin (TG) and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1.2) were determined using ELISA test kits.Significant increases in the levels of , ICAM-1, TNFα, β-TG, and F1.2 were observed in both patient groups compared to normal controls (p < .01).This observation indicates blood coagulation, endothelial injury, chronic low-grade , platelet activation, and thrombin generation are present in Hb H disease; these findings merit further assessment in a larger prospective cohort to establish possible links with thrombotic manifestations.© 2018 S.

We measured this variable in 87 subjects classified into five study groups: 19 controls (C), 18 alcoholics (E),  patients diagnosed as liver cirrhosis (CH), 11 chronic liver disease (HC) and 24 pregnant women (EMB). In our environment, the serum level of P-III-P in the healthy population was 9.12-12.8 ng/ml. In 27.77% of the alcoholics studied (5 cases) the mean value exceeded this level, 19.35 +/- 3.05 ng/ml. Forty percent of the cirrhotics (6 cases) presented the highest values, 26.54 +/- 11.45 ng/ml, while 83.33% of the patients with chronic active hepatitis presented a mean value of 18.53 +/- 3.8 ng/ml. Of the 24 pregnant women, 95.83% (23 cases) had higher than normal values, and concentrations roses in the last trimester of gestation with respect to the previous trimesters. Analysis of the correlations of all the biochemical parameters of liver function with P-III- disclosed a relationship between P-III- and alkaline phosphatase in the groups of cirrhotics and chronic persistent hepatitis (p less than .05).

Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease. Our goal was to study CRP metabolism, and to determine its relationship with lipoprotein metabolism using stable isotope methodology.Eight subjects with combined hyperlipidemia underwent a -h primed-constant infusion with deuterated leucine. CRP was purified from the plasma density fraction greater than 1.21g/ml by affinity chromatography. Lipoprotein fractions were separated by sequential ultracentrifugation. Isotope enrichment was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.The subjects had mean LDL-C levels of 147.5mg/dl and mean CRP levels of 3.4mg/l. The mean CRP production rate (PR) was .050±.012mg/kg/day and the mean CRP fractional catabolic rate (FCR) was .343±.056 pools/day (residence time 2.92days). CRP pool size () was significantly related to production (r=.93; p<.001), but not FCR. CRP  was also related to body mass index (r=.79; p=.02). There was a significant association between CRP FCR and TRL apoB-100 FCR (r=.74, p=.04), as well as between CRP  and TRL apoB-48 FCR (r=-.90, p=.002), indicating linkage between CRP and TRL metabolism.The main determinant of plasma CRP levels was CRP production rate. Moreover a significant linkage between CRP metabolism and both TRL apoB-100 and apoB-48 catabolism was noted.Copyright © 2013.

In an attempt to identify the -binding proteins, we raised polyclonal antibodies against a -amino-acid synthetic peptide (amino acid residues 390-403 of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase), which was shown to bind specifically to . One polyclonal antibody, designated aPSD-2, crossreacted with GAPDH, and its binding to GAPDH was inhibited by  but not by other phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol. Kinetic analysis of GAPDH binding to phospholipid membranes by measuring surface plasmon resonance showed that GAPDH associated with the phospholipid membrane containing  rapidly (k[on] =2.8 X 10(4) M(-1) X s[-1]) and dissociated extremely slowly (k[off]=5.9 X 10(-5) s[-1]), giving a low dissociation constant (KD=2.6nM). GAPDH bound less effectively to membranes without  with a dissociation constants of .2 microM. GAPDH-induced vesicle fusion was also inhibited by aPSD-2, suggesting that this antibody recognizes the putative -binding site on GAPDH involved in the enzyme-induced membrane fusion. Chemical fragmentation of GAPDH with cyanogen bromide followed by separation and sequence analysis of the reactive peptide resulted in the identification of a single reactive peptide with the sequence of amino acid residues 45-103 of GAPDH. Analysis of aPSD-2 binding to synthetic peptides derived from the corresponding region localized the antibody-binding site to amino acid residues 70-94 of GAPDH. Both the 25-amino-acid synthetic peptide (amino acid residues 70-94 of GAPDH) and polyclonal antibody raised against this peptide inhibited GAPDH-induced membrane fusion, suggesting that these amino acid residues play a crucial role in this membrane fusion process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524075>Prednisolone Pretreatment Enhances Intermittent Hypoxia-Induced Plasticity in Persons With Chronic Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury.</a></h1><p>.

Fourteen subjects with incomplete spinal cord injury (ASIA level C or D; mean age = 46 years) participated in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover, and placebo-controlled study. Subjects received either 60 mg oral prednisolone or a matching placebo, 1 hour before administration of AIH (, 60-second hypoxic exposures; fraction of inspired oxygen [FO] = .09). Changes in voluntary ankle strength, lower extremity electromyograms (EMG), and serum inflammatory biomarkers were quantified. . Maximal ankle plantarflexion torque was significantly higher following prednisolone + AIH versus placebo + AIH (mean difference [MD] 9, 11, and 7 newton meter [N∙m] at 30, 60, and 120 minutes post-AIH, respectively; all s <.02). Soleus surface EMG during maximal voluntary contraction was also significantly increased following prednisolone + AIH (MD 3.5,  = .02 vs placebo + AIH), while activity of other leg muscles remained unchanged. Individuals had significantly higher levels of the anti-inflammatory serum biomarker interleukin-10 after prednisolone versus placebo ( = .004 vs placebo + AIH). .

We compared the IOPs induced by the injection of different microbeads [7- and 17-µm polyurethane (PU), 7- and -µm polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), 13-µm silica, and -µm polystyrene ()] and selected the appropriate microbeads for a chronic ocular hypertensive model in terms of IOP elevation and adverse events. IOP changes were observed for 4 weeks after microbead injections. Axonal degeneration was assessed with transmission electron microscopic photographs and RGC loss was assessed with retrograde labeling.Seventy-eight rats were included. Three days after a single injection of microbeads, IOPs were increased by 24.% by 7-µm PU microbeads, 101.8% by 17-µm PU microbeads, 56.6% by 7-µm PMMA microbeads, 22.% by -µm PMMA microbeads, 153.% by 13-µm silica microbeads, and 34.7% by -µm  microbeads. 17-µm PU microbeads produced constant IOP elevation with good reproducibility (standard deviation of <6.5 mmHg). Silica injected eyes showed severe . Sustained IOP elevation by two injections of 17-µm PU microbeads resulted in a 42% axon loss and 36.5% RGC loss (p < .05, Mann-Whitney U test).PU microbead injections offer an applicable and versatile model for a chronic ocular hypertensive model in rats.

Treatment of this disorder has been limited by the lack of quantitative information regarding retinal responses to severe inflammation. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of endotoxin-induced endophthalmitis on blood-retinal  (BRB)  in vivo using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Endophthalmitis was produced by injecting Escherichia coli endotoxin into the midvitreous of pigmented rabbits. Contrast-enhanced MRI was performed at selected intervals thereafter. In all cases, a clinical grading system was used to assess the severity of inflammation before imaging. In a dose-response experiment, total vitreous protein was measured from vitreous specimens obtained 1 day after endotoxin injection and immediately after the imaging procedure.At 1 day after injection, endotoxin produced a selective breakdown of the inner BRB at all doses evaluated (.01 microgram to 500 micrograms). Permeability-surface area product normalized to the area of leaky retina (') increased from 1.35 +/- .78 x 10(-4) cm/minute (mean +/- SEM, n = 4 eyes) at a dose of .01 microgram to 8. +/- 2.22 x 10(-4) cm/minute n = 4) eyes) at a dose of 10 micrograms. Inner BRB integrity was restored by day 28 after injection. In general, changes in ', blood-aqueous  leakage, mean clinical score, and vitreous protein concentration were found, but the correlation between any two of these parameters was poor.Leakage of contrast appears early in the course of endotoxin-induced endophthalmitis and is a self-limited process. In future studies, these quantifiable changes in BRB permeability should prove useful in the assessment of various therapeutic interventions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19706826>Inflammatory biomarkers and fatigue during radiation therapy for breast and prostate cancer.</a></h1><p>Biomarkers of radiation-induced behavioral symptoms, such as fatigue, have not been identified. Studies linking inflammatory processes to fatigue in cancer survivors led us to test the hypothesis that activation of the proinflammatory cytokine network is associated with fatigue symptoms during radiation therapy for breast and prostate cancer.Individuals with early-stage breast (n = 28) and prostate cancer (n = 20) completed questionnaires and provided blood samples for determination of serum levels of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-6 at assessments conducted before, during, and after a course of radiation therapy. Serum markers of proinflammatory cytokine activity, including IL-1 receptor antagonist and C-reactive protein, were examined in a subset of participants. Random coefficient models were used to evaluate the association between changes in cytokine levels and fatigue.As expected, there was a significant increase in fatigue during radiation treatment. Changes in serum levels of inflammatory markers C-reactive protein and IL-1 receptor antagonist were positively associated with increases in fatigue symptoms ( < .05), although serum levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 were not associated with fatigue. These effects remained significant ( < .05) in analyses controlling for potential biobehavioral confounding factors, including age, body mass index, hormone therapy, depression, and sleep disturbance.Results suggest that activation of the proinflammatory cytokine network and associated increases in downstream biomarkers of proinflammatory cytokine activity are associated with fatigue during radiation therapy for breast and prostate cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11705271>A contribution to the diagnosis of the small dentigerous cyst or the paradental cyst.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to verify the relationship between the radiographically measured width of the pericoronal space () and the microscopic features of the follicle in order to contribute to the diagnosis of small dentigerous cysts and paradental cysts.

After each phase, determinations of lipoprotein cholesterol distribution, particle concentration via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), apolipoproteins, inflammatory markers, and fat-soluble dietary antioxidants were made.Body mass, body composition, dietary energy and macronutrients, and physical activity were unaffected throughout the study. Compared to the control 2% milk, LDL-C was significantly (p < .05) decreased by fPS (-9.1%) and was further decreased by TRP (-.4%); reductions with TRP were significantly greater. Total LDL particle concentration was decreased to a greater extent after TRP (-8.8%) than fPS (-4.8%; p < .05). Only TRP significantly decreased serum levels of apolipoprotein B (apoB; -6%), interleukin-8 (IL-8; -11%) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1; -19%). Plasma α- and γ-tocopherols and carotenoids, normalized to cholesterol, remained unchanged throughout the study with the exception that β-carotene was lowered by 18%.In summary, TRP in fat-free milk may provide cardiovascular benefits beyond that of fPS by inducing more substantial decreases in LDL cholesterol and particle concentration, associated with declines in markers of vascular .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11210069>Relationship between crevicular aspartate aminotransferase levels and periodontal disease progression.</a></h1><p>Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), an enzyme released from necrotic cells, has been identified in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), and elevated levels are associated with periodontal tissue destruction. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between elevated GCF levels of AST and periodontal disease progression.Over a 12-month period, 8 to 10 interproximal sites in 41 periodontitis subjects () and  healthy subjects (HS) were monitored. Clinical measurements included relative attachment level (RAL), probing depth, and bleeding on probing (BOP). Semiquantitative levels of GCF AST (< 800 microIU, > or = 800 microIU, and > or = 1,200 microIU) were determined using a chairside assay. At the 6- and 12-month visits, scaling and root planing and prophylaxis were performed in the  and HS, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated for 2 diagnostic criteria (AST > or = 800 microIU, AST > or = 1,200 microIU) utilizing 4 thresholds of disease progression as determined by 2 methods (absolute change in relative attachment level and cumulative sum [CUSUM]).The percentage of sites exhibiting AST > or = 800 microIU, AST > or = 1,200 microIU, and BOP in the  was significantly (P<.02) lower at 6 and 12 months compared to baseline. The use of crevicular AST activity to monitor periodontal disease progression was associated with many false-positive results. Overall, low specificities, PPV, and odds ratios were demonstrated by the assay when using 2 diagnostic criteria and 4 thresholds of disease progression. The high NPV suggest that a negative AST test result was indicative of a periodontally stable site.These results demonstrate that elevated levels of AST were present at sites that did not subsequently exhibit disease progression. The high prevalence of AST-positive sites due to gingival  diminished the test's ability to discriminate between progressive and stable, but inflamed, sites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26139992>Grape seed proanthocyanidin protects liver against ischemia/reperfusion injury by attenuating endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h1><p>To explore the effect of grape seed proanthocyanidin (GSP) in liver ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury and alleviation of endoplasmic reticulum stress.Male Sprague-Dawley rats (220-250 g) were divided into three groups, namely, sham, IR, and GSP groups (n = 8 each). A liver IR (70%) model was established and reperfused for 6 h. Prior to reperfusion, the GSP group was administered with GSP (100 mg/kg) for  d, and liver histology was then investigated. Serum aminotransferase and inflammatory mediators coupled with superoxide dismutase and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde were detected. Western blot was conducted to analyze the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, activating transcription factor-4, inositol-requiring enzyme-1, procaspase-12, and nuclear factor-κb. Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL staining.The serum aminotransferase, apoptotic cells, and Suzuki scores decreased in the GSP group compared with the IR group ( < .05). The methane dicarboxylic aldehyde level was decreased in the GSP group, but the superoxide dismutase level was reversed ( < .05). Similarly, GSP downregulated the proinflammatory factors and upregulated the levels of anti-inflammatory factors ( < .05). Western blot data showed that GSP increased glucose-regulated protein 78 expression and suppressed expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, activating transcription factor-4, inositol-requiring enzyme-1, procaspase-12, and nuclear factor-κb compared with the IR group.GSP possesses antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects by relieving endoplasmic reticulum stress through regulation of related signaling pathways to protect the liver against IR injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28620471>Effect of a plant sterol-enriched spread on biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and low-grade  in hypercholesterolaemic subjects.</a></h1><p>Plant sterols () lower LDL-cholesterol, an established risk factor for CHD. Endothelial dysfunction and low-grade  are two important features in the development of atherosclerosis. Whether  affect biomarkers of endothelial function and low-grade  is not well studied.

However, some patients survive intensive chemotherapy, and complete resection of primary and metastatic tumors may even be possible. In the present study, we examined the prognostic factors associated with survival after intensive chemotherapy in patients with unresectable colorectal cancer.This retrospective study enrolled 61 patients diagnosed with unresectable locally advanced colorectal cancer between January 2004 and December 2013. Among the prognostic parameters, we found that the prognoses of patients with abnormal performance status () of 2 or 3, high Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) of 1 or 2, high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) >5, and low prognostic nutritional index (PNI) <40 were poor. Thus, we scored each patient according to our scoring system (abnormal , 2 or 3 = +1; high GPS, 1 or 2 = +1; high NLR, >5 = +1; and low PNI, <40 = +1). If the patient showed abnormalities in every parameter, the score would be +4.Sixteen patients had a score of , 17 scored +1, 10 scored +2, 17 scored +3, and one scored +4. The median survival time (MST) of the 61 patients was 9 months. Patients were divided into two groups, a low-score group ( and +1) and a high-score group (+2, +3, and +4). The MST of the 33 patients in the low-score group was significantly longer than that of the 28 patients in the high-score group ( months versus 4 months, P < .001). Also, conversion chemotherapy was performed in 4.9% (3/61) of patients. And these 3 patients were in a low-score group.This new prognostic scoring system may help to select patients with unresectable advanced colorectal cancer who are able to survive through intensive chemotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11059940>Human biliary beta-glucuronidase activity before and after relief of bile duct obstruction: is it the major role in the formation of pigment gallstones?</a></h1><p>The bacterial beta-glucuronidase (bBG) can deconjugate conjugated bilirubin to form calcium bilirubinate gallstone. Yet, the role of the human biliary beta-glucuronidase (hBG) in the pathogenesis of pigment gallstone formation still remains unsolved.Hepatic bile was collected from bile-duct-obstructed patients on the day of, and 3 days after, biliary drainage. Patients were divided into pigment-stone () group (n = 34) and stone-free (SF) group (n = 29). All patients of the  group had the complication of cholangitis. The concentrations of bile contents and the activities of bBG and hBG were measured.The activities of hBG and bBG in bile obtained on the day of biliary drainage were higher in the  group than in the SF group (activities corrected for bile salt concentration: hBG 128.7 +/- 340. vs 13.1 +/- 25. U/mmol; bBG 12.5 +/- 22.2 vs 4.6 +/- 7.7 U/mmol, P < .05). This difference disappeared after biliary drainage. The changes of enzyme activity in the bile of the SF group were unremarkable before and after biliary drainage. The mean concentrations of bile pigments and free calcium in the  group were lower than those in the SF group.An increase in the activity of hBG may be a secondary response, developed after bile duct  because it was elevated only when the bile duct obstruction was associated with infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28529239>Formulation Optimization of Gastro-Retention Tablets of Paeonol and Efficacy in Treatment of Experimental Gastric Ulcer.</a></h1><p>This study aims to develop a gastroretentive sustained-release drug delivery system of paeonol using floating properties and to investigate its therapeutic effects in rat models. The gastric retention tablets of paeonol (GRT-) were prepared by a direct compression method, and the Box-Behnken design was used to optimize its formulation. The optimized formulation containing % NaHCO and a 2 : 1 ratio of paeonol and HPMC-K4M floated within 1 min and remained afloat for more than 8 h in the simulated gastric fluid (200 mL, pH=1.2) and simultaneously showed the desired sustained drug release. Moreover, small tablets (3 mm) were prepared according to the same formulation and the process technology of big tablets (8 mm). A similar drug release behavior was observed between two kinds of tablets (f=52), and then the evaluations of efficacy and retention capacity in vivo were conducted with small tablets. In vivo retention studies showed that the T (2 h) of GRT-P in rat stomachs was significantly extended compared with the T (.5 h) of normal reference preparation. Compared with the model group, low and high doses of GRT-P could significantly inhibit the increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum. Studies showed that the higher MDA content in  tissue increases the inflammatory response. The ulcer inhibition rates of GRT-P in the high-dose group were 59. and 64.1% in the ranitidine group.

The resultant activation and/or release of mediators can modulate the structure, function and survival of circulating neutrophils. Little is known of plasma factors that influence apoptosis of neutrophils in hemodialyzed patients. Hence, we investigated the effect of uremic plasma obtained during HD on the survival of neutrophils obtained from healthy volunteers. Neutrophils harvested from healthy volunteers were incubated in ultrafiltered culture medium supplemented with either 50% heterologous normal plasma obtained from healthy volunteers (n = ) or 50% uremic plasma collected from long-term HD patients dialyzed with cuprophan (CU) (n = 8), cellulose triacetate (CTA) (n = 8) or polysulfone () (n = 8) dialyzers. Plasma samples were drawn predialysis,  min after starting dialysis, and postdialysis. After 24-hour incubation, neutrophil aliquots were processed for quantification of apoptosis by flow cytometry, using propidium iodide DNA staining. In addition, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured in normal and predialysis uremic plasma samples. Neutrophils from healthy volunteers exposed to heterologous normal plasma samples exhibited 10.3 +/- 1.2% apoptosis. In contrast, the proportion of apoptosis was significantly higher among neutrophils exposed to predialysis (28.5 +/- 2.3%, p < .0001),  min (23. +/- 2.4%, p < .0001), or postdialysis uremic plasma samples (25.7 +/- 2. 3%, p < .0001). Compared to neutrophils exposed to predialysis uremic plasma samples, a significantly lower proportion of apoptosis was observed in neutrophils exposed to the -min plasma samples among patients dialyzed with CU (26.4 +/- 2.9 vs. 18.2 +/- 3.5%; p < .001) but not with CTA or  dialyzers. Further, CU membranes induced the greatest percentage decrease in neutrophil apoptosis at  min. There was a direct correlation between neutrophil apoptosis and plasma levels of TNFalpha (r = .424, p = .02) and IL-10 (r = . 744, p < .0001). The results of the study suggest that normal neutrophils exposed to uremic plasma undergo accelerated in vitro apoptosis compared to those incubated with normal plasma. Further, during HD, the apoptosis-inducing activity of uremic plasma is modulated by the use of dialyzers with different degrees of biocompatibility. The identification of soluble factors that are responsible for the increased apoptosis-inducing activity of uremic plasma needs to be further investigated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29089030>Systemic immune- index predicting chemoradiation resistance and poor outcome in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h1><p>There is increasing evidence that the existence of systemic  response is correlated with poor prognosis in several solid tumors. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the association between systemic immune- index (SII) and therapy response and overall survival in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The prognostic values of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) were also evaluated.In total, 332 patients with new diagnosis of stage III NSCLC were included in this retrospective analysis. SII was defined as platelet counts × neutrophil counts/lymphocyte counts. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the optimal cut-off value for SII, NLR, PLR and PNI. Univariate and multivariate survival analysis were performed to identify the factors correlated with overall survival.Applying cut-offs of ≥ 660 (SII), ≥ 3.57 (NLR), ≥ 147 (PLR), ≤ 52.95 (PNI), SII ≥ 660 was significantly correlated with worse ECOG  (< .001), higher T stage (< .001), advanced clinical stage (p = .019), and lower response rate (p = .018). In univariate analysis, SII ≥ 660, NLR ≥ 3.57, PLR ≥ 147, and PNI ≤ 52.95 were significantly associated with worse overall survival (p  < .001).

A study of 59 cases.</a></h1><p>A new one-step ELISA using two monoclonal antibodies specific for distinct epitopes of the free form of protein S (ELISA-m) has been developed for the direct measurement of free protein S in untreated plasma. This assay has been compared with the classic method using polyclonal antibodies to protein S (ELISA-p). The latter method has the drawback of requiring PEG precipitation of plasma which is time-consuming, difficult to perform with accuracy and therefore poorly reproducible in most laboratories. Results of both ELISAs were compared with those of a functional assay. In 30 normal subjects, there was an excellent correlation between ELISA-m and ELISA-p (r = .95) as well as between ELISA-m and the functional assay (r = .96). In twelve patients with a congenital deficiency, the levels of free protein S antigen were similarly decreased with ELISA-m and ELISA-p and in good agreement with those of protein S activity. In 20 patients with miscellaneous inflammatory diseases, the levels of free proteins S were normal with good correlation between both ELISAs and  activity, despite high levels of C4bBP-protein S complexes. As expected, in  dicoumarol-treated patients, there was a significant and parallel decrease of free protein S antigen with both ELISAs, with even lower levels of protein S activity. In 14 patients with liver cirrhosis, the mean values for free protein S antigen were normal using both assays, but with wide extreme values, whereas protein S activity was significantly lower.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15696051>Poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase inhibition modulates spinal cord dysfunction after thoracoabdominal aortic ischemia-reperfusion.</a></h1><p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a source of morbidity after thoracoabdominal aortic reconstruction. These studies were designed to determine whether PJ34, a novel ultrapotent inhibitor of the nuclear enzyme poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) could modulate neurologic injury after thoracic aortic ischemia reperfusion (TAR) in a murine model of SCI.Forty-one anesthetized male mice were subject to thoracic aortic occlusion (11 minutes) through a cervical mediastinotomy followed by 48 hours of reperfusion (TAR) under normothermic conditions. PJ34-treated mice (PJ, n = 12) were given 10 mg/kg PJ34 intraperitoneally 1 hour before ischemia and 1 hour after unclamping. The control group (UN, n = 21) received normal saline intraperitoneally 1 hour before ischemia and 1 hour after unclamping. Sham animals (n = 10) were subject to thoracic aortic exposure with no aortic clamping and similar intraperitoneal normal saline injections. PARP-1-/- (KO, n = 8) mice were subjected to the same conditions as the UN mice. Blinded observers rated murine neurologic status after TAR by using an established rodent paralysis scoring system.

Paralysis scores () and GRO-1 levels were compared with analysis of variance, and survival data were compared with chi 2 .Immediately after TAR, UN and PJ mice had severe neurologic dysfunction ( = 5.8 +/- .1 and 4.6 +/- .6, respectively; P > .05), which was significantly worse than the KO mice ( = 1. +/- .7, P < .001). After 6, 24, and 48 hours KO mice had no discernable neurologic injury ( = ). Six hours after TAR, PJ mice significantly improved ( = 1.1 +/- .73, P < .001) and remained improved at 24 ( = .7 +/- .6) and 48 hours ( = .6 +/- .6). UN mice did not improve their , and Sham mice showed no neurologic abnormality at any time during these experiments. The mortality at 48 hours was % for PJ and KO mice, 43% for UN (P = .012), and % for Sham. GRO-1 levels were significantly decreased in PJ and KO versus UN mice (UN, 583 +/- 119 vs PJ, 5.8 +/-  vs KO, 5.3 +/- 1.4 mg/pg; P < .0001). Immunohistochemistry showed evidence of decreased PAR staining and ventral motor neuron injury in PJ mice.Genetic deletion of PARP or inhibition of its activity (PJ34) rescued neurologic function in mice subjected to TAR.

All ACRC patients attending the clinic for palliative treatment were eligible for study. Demographics, including performance status (), C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin (Alb), Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), weight, weight history, body mass index (BMI), and nutritional status using the patient-generated subjective global assessment (PGSGA), were collected and correlated with survival. At a median follow-up of 29.8 mo, with a minimum follow-up of .7 mo, the median survival was 9.9 mo (.8-21.8 mo). Fifteen (29%) patients were newly diagnosed (stage IV colorectal cancer), and 36 (71%) had received prior chemotherapy. Although the median BMI was 27 kg/m2 (range = 17-41 kg/m2), 28 of 50 (56%) were nutritionally at risk.

Several bioactive peptides and hydro lysates from natural sources have now been tested in animal models of human diseases for potential anti-inflammatory effects. Eggshell membrane (ESM) is a well-known natural bioactive material. In this study, we aim to study the anti-inflammatory activity of ESM hydro lysate (AL-) in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, AL- was shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 secretion. In vivo treatment with AL- was shown to reduce dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced weight loss, clinical signs of colitis and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 (p < .05). In addition, treatment with AL- also attenuated the severity of intestinal  via down-regulation of IL-10 an anti-inflammatory cytokine. This validates potential benefits of AL- as a novel preventative target molecule for treatment of IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20352294>Phase I study of pemetrexed and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in patients with refractory breast, ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.</a></h1><p>Pemetrexed and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) are clinically active as single agents and preclinically synergistic. This phase I, open-label trial evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of pemetrexed followed by PLD in patients with breast or gynecologic cancers.Using 3 + 3 dose escalation, cohorts of 3-9 patients received escalating doses of pemetrexed 400-500 mg/m(2) on days 1 and  and PLD 30-45 mg/m(2) on day 1 of a 28-day cycle. All patients received folic acid and vitamin B(12) until 21 days after last pemetrexed dose. Patients continued until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or progression (PD).From 11/05 to 2/08, 29 patients entered treatment; median age: 60.6 years (range, 47.5-80.1); ECOG  /1: 27.6%/72.4%; primary disease site: ovarian (55.2%), breast (34.5%), peritoneum (10.3%); prior therapies: chemotherapy (100.%), surgery (72.4%), hormones/biologics (35%), and radiation (20.7%). Pemetrexed/PLD dose levels: L1 = 400/30 (n = 4), L2 = 400/35 (n = 6), L3 = 500/35 (n = 9), L4 = 500/40 (n = 7), and L5 = 500/45 (n = 3). Treatment-related grade 3-4 toxicities: hematologic-neutropenia (86.2%), leukopenia (58.6%), thrombocytopenia (48.3%), anemia (41.4%); nonhematologic-mucosal  (24.1%), febrile neutropenia (24.1%), hand-foot syndrome (13.8%), hypokalaemia (10.3%). Reasons for discontinuation: PD (48.3%), toxicity (27.6%), patient request (13.8%), and investigator request (10.3%).5 ovarian patients (20.8%) achieved partial response; median time to progression (TTP) was 6.1 months (range, 1.2-12.5).Pemetrexed plus PLD was reasonably tolerated in this heavily-pretreated population. MTD: pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) and PLD 40 mg/m(2) may be carried forward to phase II studies in specific patient populations. TTP in platinum-refractory ovarian patients was greater than expected.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28737591>HIV Incidence and Predictors of HIV Acquisition From an Outside Partner in Serodiscordant Couples in Lusaka, Zambia.</a></h1><p>Evaluate the incidence and predictors of HIV acquisition from outside partners in serodiscordant couples.Demographic, behavioral, and clinical exposures were measured quarterly in a cohort of serodiscordant cohabiting couples in Zambia from 1995 to 2012 (n = 3049). Genetic analysis classified incident infections as those acquired from the study partner (linked) or acquired from an outside partner (unlinked). Factors associated with time to unlinked HIV infection were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression stratified by sex.There were 100 unlinked infections in couples followed for a median of 806 days. Forty-five infections occurred in women [1.85/100 couple-years; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35 to 2.47]. Risk of female unlinked infection (vs. nonseroconverting females) was associated with reporting being drunk weekly/daily vs. moderate/nondrinkers at baseline [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 5.44; 95% CI: 1.03 to 28.73], genital ulcers (aHR = 6.09; 95% CI: 2.72 to 13.64), or genital  (aHR = 11.92; 95% CI: 5.60 to 25.37) during follow-up adjusting for age, years cohabiting, income, contraceptive use, previous pregnancies, history of sexually transmitted infections, and condomless sex with study partner. Fifty-five infections occurred in men (1.82/100 couple-years; 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.37). Risk of male unlinked infection was associated with genital  (aHR = 8.52; 95% CI: 3.82 to 19.03) or genital ulceration (aHR = 2.31; 95% CI: 2.05 to 8.89), reporting ≥1 outside sexual partner (aHR = 3.86; 95% CI: .98 to .17) during follow-up, and reporting being drunk weekly/daily vs. moderate/nondrinkers at baseline (aHR = 3.84; 95% CI: 1.28 to 11.55), controlling for age, income, circumcision status, and history of sexually transmitted infection.Predictors of unlinked infection in serodiscordant relationships were alcohol use, genital , and ulceration. Causes of genital  and ulceration should be screened for and treated in HIV-negative individuals. Counseling on risk of alcohol use and sex with outside partners should be discussed with couples where 1 or both are HIV-negative, including in counseling on use of pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV acquisition in the HIV-negative partner (when feasible and affordable).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26991546>Using propensity score adjustment method in genetic association studies.</a></h1><p>The statistical tests for single locus disease association are mostly under-powered. If a disease associated causal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) operates essentially through a complex mechanism that involves multiple SNPs or possible environmental factors, its effect might be missed if the causal SNP is studied in isolation without accounting for these unknown genetic influences. In this study, we attempt to address the issue of reduced power that is inherent in single point association studies by accounting for genetic influences that negatively impact the detection of causal variant in single point association analysis. In our method we use propensity score () to adjust for the effect of SNPs that influence the marginal association of a candidate marker. These SNPs might be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and/or epistatic with the target-SNP and have a joint interactive influence on the disease under study. We therefore propose a propensity score adjustment method (PSAM) as a tool for dimension reduction to improve the power for single locus studies through an estimated  to adjust for influence from these SNPs while regressing disease status on the target-genetic locus. The degree of freedom of such a test is therefore always restricted to 1.We assess PSAM under the null hypothesis of no disease association to affirm that it correctly controls for the type-I-error rate (<.05). PSAM displays reasonable power (>70%) and shows an average of % improvement in power as compared with commonly-used logistic regression method and PLINK under most simulated scenarios. Using the open-access multifactor dimensionality reduction dataset, PSAM displays improved significance for all disease loci. Through a whole genome study, PSAM was able to identify 21 SNPs from the GAW16 NARAC dataset by reducing their original trend-test p-values from within .001 and .05 to p-values less than .0009, and among which 6 SNPs were further found to be associated with immunity and .PSAM improves the significance of single-locus association of causal SNPs which have had marginal single point association by adjusting for influence from other SNPs in a dataset. This would explain part of the missing heritability without increasing the complexity of the model due to huge multiple testing scenarios. The newly reported SNPs from GAW16 data would provide evidences for further research to elucidate the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis. PSAM is proposed as an exploratory tool that would be complementary to other existing methods.

The objective of the present study was to determine whether early life exposure to air pollution causes persistent cardiovascular consequences measured at adulthood. Pregnant FVB mice were exposed to filtered (FA) or concentrated ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) during gestation and nursing. Mice were exposed to PM2.5 at an average concentration of 51.69 μg/m(3) from the Columbus, OH region for 6 h/day, 7 days/wk in utero until weaning at 3 wk of age. Birth weight was reduced in PM2.5 pups compared with FA (1.36 ± .12 g FA, n = 42 mice; 1.30 ± . g PM2.5, n = 67 P = .012). At adulthood, mice exposed to perinatal PM2.5 had reduced left ventricular fractional shortening compared with FA-exposed mice (43.6 ± 2.1% FA, 33.2 ± 1.6% PM2.5, P = .001) with greater left ventricular end systolic diameter. Pressure-volume loops showed reduced ejection fraction (79.1 ± 3.5% FA, 35.5 ± 9.5% PM2.5, P = .005), increased end-systolic volume (10.4 ± 2.5 μl FA, 39.5 ± 3.8 μl PM2.5, P = .001), and reduced dP/dt maximum (11,605 ± 200 μl/s FA, 9,569 ± 800 μl/s PM2.5, P = .05) and minimum (-9,203 ± 235 μl/s FA, -7,045 ± 189 μl/s PM2.5, P = .0005) in PM2.5-exposed mice. Isolated cardiomyocytes from the hearts of PM2.5-exposed mice had reduced peak shortening (%, 8.53 ± 2.82% FA, 6.82 ± 2.04% PM2.5, P = .003), slower calcium reuptake (τ, .22 ± .09 s FA, .26 ± .07 s PM2.5, P = .048), and reduced response to β-adrenergic stimulation compared with cardiomyocytes isolated from mice that were exposed to FA. Histological analyses revealed greater picro-sirius red-positive-stained areas in the PM2.5 vs. FA group, indicative of increased collagen deposition. We concluded that these data demonstrate the detrimental role of early life exposure to ambient particulate air pollution in programming of adult cardiovascular diseases and the potential for PM2.5 to induce persistent cardiac dysfunction at adulthood.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501951>[Pathological physiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Hypothesis (Literature review)].</a></h1><p>Currently prolonged pH-monitoring is considered as Gold standard for diagnosis of Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). Criteria and norms based on prolonged pH-monitoring were the basic concepts of pathophysiology of GERD. For example, it is accepted that esophageal hernia (EG) can be present without GERD, as well as GERD without EG. X-ray diagnosis compared to the pH- monitoring has a low sensitivity (70%) and specificity (74%). Meanwhile, in recent decades, it has been found that the pH-metry is not effective in a non-erosive reflux disease. We figured that the criteria and norms of pH-monitoring are not accurate. The purpose of this study is to determine the radiological norms of gastroesophageal junction (EGJ) and, to clarify the pathological physiology of GERD according to the new criteria and analysis of the literature.The analysis of the survey of 452 patients was done. Among them were 263 children aged from 1 day to  years who have applied to the Belarusian Center of Pediatric Surgery (BCPS) in 1983-1987 and 189 patients aged -92 years surveyed in the BCPC, as well as in the Government Geriatric Center (Israel) in 1994-2004. The standard radiography of the upper digestive tract was supplemented by provocative tests. In 21 children and 36 adults survey was carried out to locate space-occupying lesions of the chest or abdomen. Other patients had symptoms of GERD.The 21 children and 17 of 34 adult patients without of GERD symptoms had the same radiographic picture, indicating of the normal LES function: the width of the esophagus was the same all over and no more than 1.5 cm; in a horizontal position a peristaltic wave opens the LES and pushes its contents into the stomach without delay, despite the provocative tests. In  out of 34 adults with no symptoms of GERD radiographic findings show signs of LES weakness. In these patients, with a mild GERD, abdominal compression caused contraction of the GEJ with length of (3.60 +/- .8 cm) in adults which corresponds to the length of the LES, according to the manometric studies. A rounded cavity (phrenic ampoule) is formed above the contracted LES when the functional'proximal sphincter' () is closed cranially. When, during the am ampoule contraction the pressure in it reaches a threshold level, LES is opened, and the ampoule injects its contents into the stomach.  of the esophageal wall leads to the gradual ampoule expansion. With a width of the ampulla 2 cm and more we found no evidence of the displacement of the stomach into the chest cavity. The radiological symptoms of GERD are described, the identification of which at rest and during provocation, can be used for grading the antireflux function impairment of LES.1. In GERD the last peristaltic wave expands, forming a phrenic ampoule, which is closed cranially by the . 2. The width of the ampoule is proportional to the stages of GERD. This means that ampoule as well as the so-called esophageal hernia are symptoms of GERD. 3. During the ampoule formation the inner surface of it increases by at least to 11 cm2. The deficit of the mucosa is compensated by the motion of the mucosa from GEJ. The shortening of the longitudinal muscle during the ampulla contraction does not significantly affect the length of the esophagus. 4. Transient LES relaxation is caused by a deficiency of the LES capacity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22691084>Nightguard vital bleaching: side effects and patient satisfaction 10 to 17 years post-treatment.</a></h1><p>  The long-term patient satisfaction and safety of nightguard vital bleaching (NGVB) requires further evaluation.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients' satisfaction and identify side effects of NGVB up to 17 years post-treatment.  Thirty-one participants who had completed previous NGVB studies using 10% carbamide peroxide were contacted at least 10 years post-treatment (range 10-17 years, average 12.3 years). Participants reported shade satisfaction (very satisfied [VS], partially satisfied [], or not satisfied [NS]) as well as potential complications. Participants had teeth # 6 to 11 examined for tooth vitality, gingival  (Löe's Gingival Index [GI]), and radiographically for external cervical resorption (ECR).  All of the participants had successful lightening of their teeth. Sixty-one percent (19) had not retreated their teeth. Of those who had not retreated their teeth and who responded to the question of whitening satisfaction, 31% (4/13) were VS, 54% (7/13) were , and % (2/13) were NS with their current shade. Of those who had retreated their teeth, all were VS or . Ninety-one percent of the examined teeth had GI =  (normal), 7% had GI = 1 (mild ), and 2% had GI = 2 (moderate ). Sixty-nine percent of teeth tested responded to a cold stimulus. Radiographs did not detect ECR or apical lesions. No participant reported having a gingival biopsy post-treatment, and 87% would whiten again.  Patient satisfaction with NGVB may last as long as 12.3 years in average (range 10-17 years) post-treatment. GI and ECR findings were considered within the normal expectations for the sample studied, suggesting minimal clinical post-NGVB side effects up to 17 years.Nightguard vital bleaching provides patient satisfaction with minimal side effects up to 17 years post-treatment.© 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24323759>Proteasome Inhibitor Reduces Astrocytic iNOS Expression and Functional Deficit after Experimental Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Rats.</a></h1><p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with perihematoma  and edema. We have recently shown cell death and a robust activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in brain areas adjacent to the hematoma. Proteasome represents a key component necessary for the activation of NF-κB. The aim of our present study was to examine if selective proteasome inhibition with a clinically relevant agent, -519, might influence the ICH pathogenesis, and improve functional outcome. ICH was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by the double blood injection method. -519 was administered intravenously 4 h and  min after induction of ICH. Behavioral testing was performed 3, 5, and 7 days later. The animals were sacrificed on day 7, and their brains were evaluated for hemorrhage size and  using immunohistochemistry with antibody to various inflammatory markers. Treatment with -519 significantly (p < .05) reduced behavioral impairment post-ICH as determined by the footfault test. This effect was not due to difference in ICH volume. The improved functional status of -519 treated animals correlated positively (p < .01) with reduced expression of astroglial iNOS in areas adjacent to the hemorrhage 7 days post-ICH. No delayed changes in expression of OX-42 and ED-1 (microglia/macrophages marker), or vimentin (intermediate filament; marker of astroglia activation) were detected in animals treated with -519. This data suggests that modulation of proteasome-activated processes may represent a strategic target for treatment of ICH in humans.</p></html>
