Antiinflammation, a useful and attractive approach in experimental oncology, helps to investigate the inflammation preventive potential of natural products and synthetic entities. During the course of our research work in natural product chemistry and synthesis of novel structures in the field of heterocyclic chemistry, we found interesting results. In natural product , α-amyrin acetate, lupeol acetate, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid and their derivatives showed interesting potential analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. In this review specific reference has been made to novel classes and newly discovered compounds in the literature, which exhibited required activities. Indomethacine is a potent synthetic compound, which becomes the basis of novel anti-inflammatory agents. Shen postulated a receptor theory which indicates the physical parameters responsible for anti-inflammatory activity. Attempt has been made to cover almost all the anti-inflammatory agents which fall under the various chemical structural classes of compounds showing required activity. The objective of this review is to compile relevant data on the mechanism of action of terpenes isolated from active ethnomedicinal plants to examine the role terpenoids have in medicinal plants used against inflammatory diseases, especially those in which an immune response is implicated. In addition, a selection of several structurally related compounds has been compiled in order to analyze the possible structural characteristics and relationships between the different types of structures found in triterpenoids. The selection of active species was made on the basis of their immunomodulatory activity, and their role in the resolution of diseases in which the immune system is implicated to examine the mechanism by which they are useful as ethnopharmacological medicines. These terpenes include ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, . This review discusses in detail the preclinical studies conducted with triterpenes and provides an insight into its mechanism of action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17496167>Reciprocal regulation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase and NADPH oxidase by  in human endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Nitric oxide (NO) produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is a protective principle in the vasculature. Many cardiovascular diseases are associated with reduced NO bioactivity and eNOS uncoupling due to oxidative stress. Compounds that reverse eNOS uncoupling and increase eNOS expression are of therapeutic interest. Zizyphi Spinosi semen (ZSS) is one of the most widely used traditional Chinese herbs with protective effects on the cardiovascular system. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and HUVEC-derived EA.hy 926 cells, an extract of ZSS increased eNOS promoter activity, eNOS mRNA and protein expression, and NO production in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Major ZSS constituents include saponins, such as jujuboside A and B, and pentacyclic triterpenes, such as betulin and . Jujuboside A, jujuboside B, or betulin had no significant effect on eNOS expression, whereas  increased eNOS mRNA and protein expression in HUVEC and EA.hy 926 cells. Interestingly,  also attenuated the expression of NADPH oxidase subunits Nox4 and p22phox, thereby reducing oxidative stress and improving eNOS function. Consequently, -treated endothelial cells showed an increased production of bioactive NO (as indicated by a higher efficacy in stimulating cGMP generation in RFL-6 reporter cells). Thus,  possesses combined properties of eNOS up-regulation and NADPH oxidase down-regulation. Compounds such as  may have a therapeutic potential in cardiovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22771545>Poly (lactide-co-glycolide) encapsulated extract of Phytolacca decandra demonstrates better intervention against induced lung adenocarcinoma in mice and on A549 cells.</a></h2><p>We tested relative efficacy of the extract of Phytolacca decandra (PD) and its PLGA nano-encapsulated form (NPD) in mice intoxicated with benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) (25 mg/kg b.w.) plus sodium-arsenite (SA) (10 mg/kg b.w.) and on A549 lung cancer cells in vitro. We characterized nanoparticles by physico-chemical and morphological studies using dynamic light scattering, scanning electron and atomic force microscopies. We also conducted FTIR and (1)H NMR studies to determine if NPD had a co-polymeric nature and analyzed drug-DNA interaction through circular dichroism spectra (CD) and melting temperature profiles (T(m)) taking calf thymus DNA as target. An oral dose of 0.3mg/kg b.w. for NPD and 30 mg/kg b.w. for PD in mice showed chemopreventive effects in regard to DNA fragmentation, comet tail length and toxicity biomarkers like ROS generation, NFκβ, p53, PARP, CYP1A1 and caspase 3. NPD showed greater effects than that by PD. Results of in vivo studies showed similar effects on A549 in regard to cell viability, DAPI and PI staining, Comet tail length, DNA fragmentation. To further confirm the biological molecule present in PD we analyzed its chromatographic fraction through mass spectroscopy, NMR and FT-IR studies and characterized it to be a tri-terpenoid, a derivative of  with a molecular formula C(30)H(46)O(2.) Thus, overall results suggest that nano-encapsulation of PD (NPD) increases drug bioavailability and thereby has a better chemo-preventive action against lung cancer in vivo and on A549 cells in vitro than that of PD.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-KO) mice, 2h of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion followed by 22h of reperfusion led to an enhanced expression of NADPH oxidase subunits (NOX2, NOX4 and p22phox) and isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (neuronal nNOS and inducible iNOS) in the ischemic hemisphere compared with the non-ischemic contralateral hemisphere. This was associated with elevated levels of 3-nitrotyrosine, an indicator of peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative protein modification. Pre-treatment with  (50mg/kg/day for 7days via gavage) prior MCA occlusion prevented the ischemia reperfusion-induced upregulation of NOX2, nNOS and iNOS. In parallel,  reduced the levels of 3-nitrotyrosine. In addition, treatment with  enhanced the expression of endothelial eNOS in the non-ischemic hemispheres. Finally,  reduced infarct volume and ameliorated the neurological deficit in this mouse stroke model. In conclusion,  protects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. This is likely to result from a reduction of oxidative stress (by downregulation of NOX2) and nitrosative stress (by reduction of nNOS and iNOS), and an enhancement of blood flow (by upregulation of eNOS).Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we previously constructed the  biosynthetic pathway, in which several enzymes function in a NADPH or oxygen-dependent manner. To seek whether the intracellular supply of the NADPH/oxygen of S. cerevisiae could be managed for improving  production, the expressions of the mutated 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (mBDH1) and the yeast codon optimized Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (mvhb) were separately introduced into the  forming yeast strain.

Our results showed that the expression of mBDH1 and mvhb increased the concentration of  to 1.5 and 3.2 times, respectively relative to the controls. Meanwhile, the growth property of these engineered yeast strains was also monitored. Though the mvhb expression greatly improved the production of  but exerted a serious inhibition on yeast growth. However, it was possible to keep desirable yeast growth phenotype using an appropriate concentration of acetoin with the expression of mBDH1.

A wide variety of neuroprotective herbs have been reported in Ayurveda. Brahmi, Bacopa monnieri is a nootropic ayurvedic herb known to be effective in neurological disorders from ancient times. Numerous approaches including natural and synthetic compounds have been applied against Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-β and Tau are the hallmarks proteins of several neuronal dysfunctions resulting in Alzheimer's disease. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein known to be involved in progression of Alzheimer's disease. The generation of reaction  species, increased neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity are the major physiological dysfunctions associated with Tau aggregates, which leads to dementia and behavioural deficits. Bacoside A, Bacoside B, Bacosaponins, , etc; are the bioactive component of Brahmi belonging to various chemical families. Each chemical component known have its significant role in neuroprotection. The neuroprotective properties of Brahmi and its bioactive components including reduction of ROS, neuroinflammation, aggregation inhibition of Amyloid-β and improvement of cognitive and learning behaviour. Here on basis of earlier studies we hypothesize the inhibitory role of Brahmi against Tau-mediated toxicity. The overall studies have concluded that Brahmi can be used as a lead formulation for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In order to address these issues, herein, we developed  loaded polylactide-co-glycolide- monomethoxy polyethylene glycol nanoparticles (PLGA-mPEG NPs). The PLGA-mPEG co-polymer was synthesized and characterized using NMR and FT-IR. BA loaded PLGA-mPEG NPs were prepared by an emulsion solvent evaporation method. The developed nanoparticles had a desirable particle size (∼147nm) and exhibited uniform spherical shape under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The PLGA-mPEG NPs were able to decrease the uptake by macrophages (i.e. J774A.1 and Raw 264.7 cells) as compared to PLGA nanoparticles. In vitro cytotoxicity in MCF7 and PANC-1 cells demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity of BA loaded PLGA-mPEG NPs as compared to free BA. The cellular uptake study in both the cell lines demonstrated time dependent uptake behavior. The enhanced cytotoxicity of BA NPs was also supported by increased cellular apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, generation of high reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell cycle arrest. Further, intravenous pharmacokinetics study revealed that BA loaded PLGA-mPEG NPs could prolong the circulation of BA and remarkably enhance half-life by ∼7.21 folds. Consequently, in vivo studies in Ehrlich tumor (solid) model following intravenous administration demonstrated superior antitumor efficacy of BA NPs as compared to native BA. Moreover, BA NPs treated Ehrlich tumor mice demonstrated no biochemical, hematological and histological toxicities. These findings collectively indicated that the BA loaded PLGA-mPEG NPs might serve as a promising nanocarrier for improved therapeutic efficacy of .Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, metronidazole and tinidazole are the only drugs approved for treatment of the condition. However, problems such as metronidazole-resistant T. vaginalis isolates and allergic reactions have been reported. Based on data previously published by our group, structural changes in  (1) were performed, generating three new compounds that were tested for in vitro anti-T.vaginalis activity in this study. Whereas derivative 2 did not demonstrate anti-T. vaginalis activity, derivatives 3 and 4 reduced trophozoite viability by 100%, with MIC values of 50μM. The structural difference of two compounds was performed only on the C-28 position. Derivative 3 showed low cytotoxicity against Vero cells in 24h; however, derivative 4 was highly cytotoxic, but efficient when associated with metronidazole in the synergism assay. ROS production by neutrophils was reduced, and derivative 3 showed anti-inflammatory effect. Collectively, the results of this study provide in vitro evidence that  derivatives 3 and 4 are potential compounds with anti-T. vaginalis activity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Previous studies show that BA induces proteasome-dependent degradation of specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in prostate cancer cells and this study focused on the mechanism of action of BA in colon cancer cells.The effects of BA on colon cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis and tumor growth in vivo were determined using standardized assays. The effects of BA on Sp proteins and Sp-regulated gene products were analyzed by western blots, and real time PCR was used to determine microRNA-27a (miR-27a) and ZBTB10 mRNA expression.BA inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in RKO and SW480 colon cancer cells and inhibited tumor growth in athymic nude mice bearing RKO cells as xenograft. BA also decreased expression of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 transcription factors which are overexpressed in colon cancer cells and decreased levels of several Sp-regulated genes including survivin, vascular endothelial growth factor, p65 sub-unit of NFκB, epidermal growth factor receptor, cyclin D1, and pituitary tumor transforming gene-1. The mechanism of action of BA was dependent on cell context, since BA induced proteasome-dependent and proteasome-independent downregulation of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in SW480 and RKO cells, respectively. In RKO cells, the mechanism of BA-induced repression of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 was due to induction of reactive  species (ROS), ROS-mediated repression of microRNA-27a, and induction of the Sp repressor gene ZBTB10.These results suggest that the anticancer activity of BA in colon cancer cells is due, in part, to downregulation of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 transcription factors; however, the mechanism of this response is cell context-dependent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28554130> derivative B10 inhibits glioma cell proliferation through suppression of SIRT1, acetylation of FOXO3a and upregulation of Bim/PUMA.</a></h2><p>Glioma is the most common primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. B10 is a new glycosylated derivative of  with enhanced cytotoxic activity. The present study was designed to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the anticancer effect of B10 in glioma cells. 25-50μM B10 resulted in a significant decrease of cell viability and BrdU incorporation. 25-50mg/kg B10 significantly reduced the implanted tumor weight and volume in nude mice. Activation of apoptosis was found in glioma cells when the cells were exposed to B10, as evidenced by increased number of TUNEL-stained cells, increased caspase 3 and 9 activities, and Bax and cleaved PARP expression. B10 caused a significant decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, mitochondrial complex I, II, III, IV, and V activities, and ATP level, and increase of mitochondrial ROS production, indicating the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction. B10 reduced the expression of sirtuin (SIRT) 1 and resulted in an increase in forkhead box O (FOXO) 3a expression and acetylation. Activation of SIRT1 by SRT-1720 and downregualtion of FOXO3a using shRNA significantly inhibited B10-induced cytotoxicity. B10 markedly increased the expression of Bim and PUMA. Downregualtion of FOXO3a or activation of SIRT1 significantly inhibited B10-induced increase of Bim and PUMA expression. Downregualtion of Bim or PUMA could suppress B10-induced increase of Bax expression. Moreover, B10-induced cytotoxicity was significantly suppressed by downregulation of Bim or PUMA. In summary, we identified B10 as a potent therapeutic candidate for glioma treatment and SIRT1-FOXO3a-Bim/PUMA axis as a novel therapeutic target.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In this study, we determined the effects of BA on proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis in HCC cell lines and on tumour growth and pulmonary metastasis in mice. The results suggested that BA could inhibit cell viability and proliferation of HCC cell lines including HepG2, LM3, and MHCC97H. In addition, BA induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells characterised condensed nuclei and nuclear fragmentation. Moreover, western blot analysis showed that BA-induced apoptosis associated with increasing of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and decreasing of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.

This study provides evidence that  is highly effective against the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa by inducing dose- and time-dependent apoptosis. The apoptotic process was further investigated using a proteomics approach to reveal protein expression changes in HeLa cells following  treatment. Proteomic analysis revealed that there were six up- and thirty down-regulated proteins in -induced HeLa cells, and these proteins were then subjected to functional pathway analysis using multiple analysis software. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase decarboxylating, chain A Horf6-a novel human peroxidase enzyme that involved in redox process, was found to be down-regulated during the apoptosis process of the oxidative stress response pathway. Consistent with our results at the protein level, an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species was observed in -treated cells.

Moreover, BA significantly inhibited the increase of ROS level, as well as the decrease of NO level, the endothelial NOS (eNOS) activity, and the SOD activity in aortas induced by pyrogallol-derived superoxide anion.These results indicate that BA reduces the impairment of EDR in rat aortas exposed to exogenous superoxide anion, which may closely relate to the reduction of oxidative stress and activation of eNOS-NO pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344390> derivatives can protect human Müller cells from glutamate-induced oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Müller cells are the predominant retinal glial cells. One of the key roles of Müller cells is in the uptake of the neurotransmitter glutamate and in its conversion to glutamine. Müller cell dysfunction due to oxidative stress elicited by high glutamate concentrations can lead to toxicity, which promote the pathogenesis of retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. This study investigated the anti-oxidant activity and mechanisms of  (BA) and its derivatives in human Müller cells. Human MIO-M1 Müller cells were pre-treated in the presence or absence of BA, BE as well as their derivatives (named H3-H20) followed by incubation with glutamate. Cell viability was evaluated with the MTT and calcein-AM assays. Reactive  species (ROS) production in MIO-M1 cells was measured using CM-HDCFDA and flow cytometry. The activation of cellular apoptosis and necrosis was analyzed with annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometry. The modulation of signaling pathways involved in glutamate-mediated cytotoxicity and ROS production was evaluated by immunoblotting. The BA derivatives H3, H5 and H7 exhibited minimal cytotoxicity and significant anti-oxidant activity. These compounds significantly suppressed ROS production and attenuated cellular necrosis elicited by glutamate-induced oxidative stress. The protective effects of H3, H5 and H7 in MIO-M1 cells were associated with the attenuation of Akt, Erk, and JNK signaling. The BA analogues H3, H5 and H7 are protective against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in human Müller cells, and elicit their actions by modulation of the Erk, Akt and JNK signaling pathways. These agents are potential candidate molecules for the prevention or treatment of human retinal diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, its mechanism against multiple myeloma (MM) remains elusive. Herein, for the first time, we studied the antitumor activity of BA against MM both  and . We showed that BA mediated cytotoxicity in MM cells through apoptosis, S-phase arrest, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse, and overwhelming reactive  species (ROS) accumulation. Moreover, when the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) effectively abated elevated ROS, the BA-induced apoptosis was partially reversed. Our results revealed that BA-mediated ROS overproduction played a pivotal role in anticancer activity. Molecularly, we found that BA resulted in marked inhibition of the aberrantly activated NF-B pathway in MM. As demonstrated by using the NF-B pathway-specific activator TNF- and the inhibitor BAY 11-7082, BA-mediated inhibition of the NF-B pathway directly promoted the overproduction of ROS and, ultimately, cell death. Furthermore, BA also exerted enormous tumor-inhibitory effects via repressing proliferation and inhibiting the NF-B pathway in our xenograft model. Overall, by blocking the NF-B pathway that breaks redox homeostasis, BA, as a potent NF-B inhibitor, is a promising therapeutic alternative for MM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29555058> induces DNA damage and apoptosis in SiHa cells.</a></h2><p> (BA) is a naturally occurring terpenoid found principally in the bark of birch trees as well as in numerous other plants.

The cell viability was measured by using MTT assay and the morphological changes, DNA damage, changes in cell cycle and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were used for the assessment of apoptosis. BA was shown to destroy SiHa cells preferentially in a concentration dependent manner with a 50% inhibition of the cells at 39.83 μg/ml.

In this study, we show that , a catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerases, inhibits the formation of apoptotic topoisomerase I-DNA cleavable complexes in prostate cancer cells induced by drugs like camptothecin, staurosporine, and etoposide. Although events like ROS generation, oxidative DNA damage, and DNA fragmentation were observed after  treatment, there is no topoisomerase I-DNA cleavable complex formation, which is a key step in ROS-induced apoptotic processes.

Recent evidence suggests that rather diverse cellular signaling events may be attributed to the same common upstream switch in cellular metabolism. In this study we therefore examined the metabolic changes induced by BA (10 µM) administration, with focus on cellular glucose metabolism. We demonstrate that BA elevates the rates of cellular glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts with concomitant reduction of glucose oxidation. Without eliciting signs of obvious cell death BA leads to compromised mitochondrial function, increased expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1 and 2, and liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-dependent activation AMP-activated protein kinase. AMPK activation accounts for the increased glucose uptake and glycolysis which in turn are indispensable for cell viability upon BA treatment.

Recent studies have shown that BA has significant cytotoxicity to various types of human cancer cells, and shows potential in cancer treatment. However, the efficacy of BA on human colorectal cancer tumor cells is still unclear. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the anti-cancer activity of BA in human colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo to investigate the possible mechanism. In this experiment, we found that BA inhibited colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro with a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, BA could induce cell apoptosis by upregulating expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and downregulating protein of Bcl-2. BA could increase the production of reactive  species and reduce mitochondrial membrane potential of cancer cell, suggesting that BA induced cancer cells apoptosis by mitochondrial mediated pathways. Furthermore, BA significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells, reduced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) and increased the expression of MMPs inhibitor (TIMP-2). In addition, the growth of tumor was significantly suppressed by intraperitoneal administration of 20 mg/kg/day of BA in a xenograft tumor mouse model of HCT-116. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis showed that MMP-2+ cells and Ki-67+ cells were reduced and cleaved caspase-3+ cells were increased in tumor tissues of mice after BA administration. The results showed that BA not only promoted the apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells, but also inhibited the metastasis of cancer cells.

We previously reported that BA inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin-6 production through modulation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). This study attempted to identify other mechanisms through which BA modulates LPS signalling in mononuclear cells. The effects of BA on signalling pathways downstream were focused on in this study.We determined the ability of BA to interfere with p38 and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation as well as Akt phosphorylation and nuclear factor-κB activation using LPS-activated hPBMCs as an in vitro model. LPS-induced endotoxin shock in mice was the in vivo model employed.BA inhibited LPS-induced COX-2 protein expression and prostaglandin E(2) production and also attenuated LPS-induced ERK and Akt phosphorylation, but not p38 in hPBMCs. BA abolished LPS-induced IκBα phosphorylation and thus normalized the levels of IκBα in cytosol. BA also inhibited LPS-induced reactive  species formation and lactate dehydrogenase release. Interestingly, BA improved the life span of mice in endotoxin shock and also inhibited PGE(2) production and myeloperoxidase activity in vivo.BA modulates LPS-induced COX-2 expression in hPBMCs by inhibiting ERK and Akt pathways as well as by modulating IκBα phosphorylation. At the same time, no cell toxicity was observed. The effect of the drug was confirmed through in vivo experiments. The study gives an insight into the molecular mechanisms of BA.© 2011 The Authors.

The current treatment for ischemic stroke is mainly focused on intravenous thrombolytic therapy. However, ischemia/ reperfusion induces neuronal damage, which significantly influences the outcome of patients with ischemic stroke, and the exact mechanism implicated in ischemia/reperfusion injury remains unclear, although evidence shows that oxidative stress is likely to be involved.  is mainly known for its anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activities. Our previous study showed that  could decrease the reactive  species (ROS) production by regulating the expression of NADPH oxidase. Thus, we hypothesized that  may protect against brain ischemic injury in the animal model of stroke. Focal cerebral ischemia was achieved by using the standard intraluminal occlusion method and reperfusion enabled after 2 h ischemia. Neurological deficits were scored. Infarct size was determined with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride monohydrate (TTC) staining and the mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) was determined by RT-PCR in infarct tissue. ROS generation and apoptosis in ischemic tissue were analyzed by measuring the oxidative conversion of cell permeable 2',7'-dichloro-fluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF) in fluorescence microplate reader and TUNEL assay, respectively. In Kunming mice, 2 h of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion followed by 24 or 72 h of reperfusion led to an enhanced NOX4 expression in the ischemic hemisphere. This was associated with elevated levels of ROS generation and neuronal apoptosis. Pre-treatment with  (50 mg/kg/day for 7 days via gavage) prior to MCA occlusion prevented the ischemia/reperfusion-induced up-regulation of NOX4 and ROS production. In addition, treatment with  could markedly blunt the ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal apoptosis. Finally,  reduced infarct volume and ameliorated the neurological deficit in this stroke mouse model. Our results suggest that  protects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice and the down-regulation of NOX4 may represent a mechanism contributing to this effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25299784>Inhibition of phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase pathway by a novel naphthol derivative of  induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells of different origin.</a></h2><p> (BA) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid natural product reported to inhibit cell growth in a variety of cancers. However, the further clinical development of BA got hampered because of poor solubility and pharmacological properties. Interestingly, this molecule offer several hotspots for structural modifications in order to address its associated issues. In our endeavor, we selected C-3 position for the desirable chemical modification in order to improve its cytotoxic and pharmacological potential and prepared a library of different triazoline derivatives of BA. Among them, we previously reported the identification of a potential molecule, that is, 3{1N(5-hydroxy-naphth-1yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4yl}methyloxy  (HBA) with significant inhibition of cancer cell growth and their properties. In the present study, we have shown for the first time that HBA decreased the expression of phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) p110α and p85α and caused significant downregulation of pAKT and of NFκB using human leukemia and breast cancer cells as in vitro models. Further it was revealed that PI3K inhibition by HBA induced cell cycle arrest via effects on different cell cycle regulatory proteins that include CDKis cyclins and pGSK3β. Also, this target-specific inhibition was associated with mitochondrial apoptosis as was reflected by the increased expression of mitochondrial bax, downregulated bcl2 and decreased mitochondrial levels of cytochrome c, together with reactive oxygen species generation and decline in mitochondrial membrane potential. The apoptotic effectors such as caspase 8, caspase 9 and caspase 3 were found to be upregulated besides DNA repair-associated enzyme, that is, PARP cleavage caused cancer cell death. Pharmacodynamic evaluation revealed that both HBA and BA were safe upto the dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight and with acceptable pharmacodynamic parameters. The in vitro data corroborated with in vivo anticancer activity wherein Ehrlich solid tumor showed that HBA as a more potent agent than BA without any body weight loss and mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15451550>Protection of Ewing's sarcoma family tumor (ESFT) cell line SK-N-MC from  induced apoptosis by alpha-DL-tocopherol.</a></h2><p> (BA) is known to induce apoptosis in melanoma neuroectodermal and malignant brain cancer cell lines. Present report describes the role of antioxidants on the BA-induced toxicity to human cell line SK-N-MC. Hydrophilic antioxidants viz., L-ascorbic acid (VitC) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (l-NAC) had no protective effect on BA-induced apoptosis at the maximal concentrations tested. The lipophilic antioxidant, alpha-DL-tocopherol (VitE) showed a concentration and a time dependent effect on the protection of SK-N-MC cells from BA-induced apoptosis. The apoptotic parameters were analyzed using FACS analysis of propidium iodide (PI) stained nuclei, PS externalization using Annexin-V assay and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Generation of superoxide radical was monitored by the fluorescent dye hydroethidium (HE). Cells showed Annexin-V positivity and an increase in the propidium iodide (PI) uptake in the early hours of treatment with BA, which was concomitant with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Addition of alpha-DL-tocopherol to the cell cultures 1-h prior to the treatment with BA abolished all the effects of BA-induced apoptosis. These observations suggest that BA initiates events at membrane level leading to induction of apoptosis. The observed ineffectiveness of hydrophilic antioxidants and substantial protection by lipophilic antioxidants indicate involvement of membrane-associated damages that form the basis of BA-induced cytotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15363977>Apoptotic activity of  derivatives on murine melanoma B16 cell line.</a></h2><p>The mitochondrion plays a crucial role in the process of apoptosis and has thus become one of the targets for the search for potential chemotherapeutic agents.  [3beta-hydroxy-lup-20(19)lupaen-28-carbonic acid], a lupane-type triterpene which is abundant in many plant species, has been shown to exert a direct effect on the mitochondria and subsequent apoptosis in melanoma cells. Chemical synthesis and modification of  are being explored to develop more potent derivatives. We present here the apoptotic activity of several natural derivatives of  which were isolated from the roots of a Chinese medicinal herb, Pulsatilla chinensis (Bge) Regel [Ye, W., Ji, N.N., Zhao, S.X., Liu, J.H., Ye, T., McKervey, M.A., Stevenson, P., 1996. Triterpenoids from Pulsatilla chinensis. Phytochemistry 42, 799-802]. Of the five compounds tested, 3-oxo-23-hydroxybetulinic acid was the most cytotoxic on murine melanoma B16 cells (IC50=22.5 microg/ml), followed by 23-hydroxybetulinic acid and  (IC50=32 and 76 microg/ml, respectively), with lupeol and betulin exhibiting the weakest cytotoxicity (IC50> or =100 microg/ml). Exposure of B16 cells to , 23-hydroxybetulinic acid and 3-oxo-23-hydroxybetulinic acid caused a rapid increase in reactive oxidative species production and a concomitant dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which resulted in cell apoptosis, as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy, gel electrophoresis and flow-cytometric analysis. Cell cycle analysis further demonstrated that both 3-oxo-23-hydroxybetulinic acid and 23-hydroxybetulinic acid dramatically increased DNA fragmentation at the expense of G1 cells at doses as low as 12.5 and 25 microg/ml, respectively, thereby showing their potent apoptotic properties. Our results showed that hydroxylation at the C3 position of  is likely to enhance the apoptotic activity of  derivatives (23-hydroxybetulinic acid and 3-oxo-23-hydroxybetulinic acid) on murine melanoma B16 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28977893>Combination of  and chidamide synergistically inhibits Epstein-Barr virus replication through over-generation of reactive oxygen species.</a></h2><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has widely infected more than 90% of human populations. Currently, there is no efficient way to remove the virus because the EBV carriers are usually in a latent stage that allows them to escape the immune system and common antiviral drugs. In the effort to develop an efficient strategy for the removal of the EBV virus, we have shown that  (BA) slightly suppresses EBV replication through SOD2 suppression with subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage in EBV-transformed LCL (lymphoblastoid cell line) cells. Chidamide (CDM, CS055), a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), could significantly switch EBV from the latent stage to the lytic stage with increased gene expression of BZLF1 and BMRF1, but has a small effect on EBV replication due to the suppression effect of CDM-mediated ROS generation. Interestingly, a combination of BA and CDM synergistically inhibits EBV replication with ROS over-generation and subsequent DNA damage and apoptosis. Overexpression of SOD2 diminishes this effect, while SOD2 knockdown mimics this effect. An  xenograft tumor development study with the tail vein injection of EBV-transformed LCL cells in nude mice proves that the combination of BA and CDM synergistically increases superoxide anion release in tumor tissues and suppresses EBV replication and tumor growth, and significantly prolongs mouse survival. We conclude that the combination of BA and CDM could be an efficient strategy for clinical EBV removal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25585916>A potent tumoricidal co-drug 'Bet-CA'--an ester derivative of  and dichloroacetate selectively and synergistically kills cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Selective targeting of cancer cells employing multiple combinations as co-drug holds promise for new generation therapeutics.  (BA), a plant secondary metabolite kills cancer cells and Dichloroacetate (DCA) is capable of reversing the Warburg phenotype by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Here, we report synthesis, characterization and tumoricidal potential of a co-drug Bet-CA, where a DCA molecule has been appended on C-3 hydroxyl group of BA to generate an ester derivative for increased solubility and subsequent cleavage by internal esterase(s) to release one unit each of BA and DCA. In vitro studies revealed pronounced synergistic cytotoxicity of Bet-CA against a broad spectrum of cancer cells and it selectively killed them when co-cultured with human fibroblasts. Bet-CA treatment increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, significantly altered mitochondrial membrane potential gradient (ΔΨm); followed by the release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) which prompted cells to undergo mitochondria mediated apoptosis. In vivo experimentation expectedly exhibited tumor inhibitory potential of Bet-CA and clinically achievable doses did not produce any apparent toxicity. Taken together, results suggestively raise an important corollary hypothesis stating that Bet-CA selectively and synergistically combats cancer without producing toxic manifestations and emerges to be the prospect for the new generation therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18433854>Nitric oxide induces caspase activity in boar spermatozoa.</a></h2><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive free radical that plays a key role in intra- and intercellular signaling. Production of radical  species and an apoptotic-like phenomenon have recently been implicated in cryodamage during sperm cryopreservation. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, on boar sperm viability. Semen samples were pooled from four boars that were routinely used for artificial insemination. Flow cytometry was used to compare semen incubated with SNP to control semen. Specifically, NO production was measured using the NO indicator dye diaminofluorescein diacetate, and caspase activity was determined using the permeable pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD linked to FITC. SNP induced a significant increase in the percentage of sperm cells showing caspase activity, from 9.3% in control samples to 76.2% in SNP-incubated samples (P<0.01). This study suggests that NO is a major free radical involved in boar sperm damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26542288> downregulates expression of oxidative stress-induced lipoprotein lipase via the PKC/ERK/c-Fos pathway in RAW264.7 macrophages.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis is a major cause of coronary artery disease, which is characterized by cellular lipid accumulation. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme in lipid . Studies have shown that macrophage-derived LPL exhibits proatherogenic properties, and plays a major role in lipid accumulation in macrophages. Evidence suggests that oxidative stress can effectively enhance macrophage LPL production.  (BA) is a pentacyclic lupane triterpene with a potent antioxidant activity. In this study, we investigated whether BA affects the expression of macrophage LPL and how it regulates cellular lipid accumulation.We revealed that BA downregulated H2O2-simulated macrophage LPL protein, mRNA levels and its activity in both concentration- and time-dependent manners. Furthermore, BA decreased LPL-involved total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in macrophages. In addition, cellular lipid staining by Oil Red O showed that BA decreased cellular lipid droplet deposition. Next, we confirmed that pretreatment with BA decreased H2O2-induced production of intracellular reactive oxygen species in a concentration-dependent manner. Further studies demonstrated that BA inhibited H2O2-induced membrane translocation of PKC, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and c-Fos. Finally, the induction of LPL production and activity by H2O2 was abolished by BA, inhibition of PKC or ERK or depletion c-Fos, respectively.BA, through its role of antioxidant activity, attenuated macrophage-derived LPL expression and activity induced by oxidative stress, and effectively reduced cellular lipid accumulation, likely through inhibition of the  involving PKC, ERK and c-Fos. These effects of BA may contribute to its mitigation of atherosclerosis and help develop BA as a therapeutic compound in treatment of atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Most patients respond well to standard therapy, while a majority relapse, and development of an effective therapy for AML patients is still urgently needed. In this study, we demonstrated that  (BA) significantly increased Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) expression through demethylation on the AHR promoter in AML cells, and the increased AHR expression interacts with and sequesters ARNT, subsequently suppressing hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) pathway. We also found that histone deacetylase inhibitor chidamide (CDM) treatment significantly increased p300 over-acetylation in AML cells with dissociation of p300 with HIF1α, and subsequently suppressed the HIF1α pathway. Further investigation showed that BA/CDM combination additively increased generation of reactive  species (ROS) with DNA damage, apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Also, BA/CDM combination additively suppressed the HIF1α pathway with decreased VEGF expression.  mice study showed that BA/CDM combination significantly suppressed AML tumor growth, and overexpression of SOD2 and a constitutive HIF1α (HIF1C) completely diminished this effect. We conclude that a BA/CDM combination inhibits AML tumors through ROS over-generation and HIF1α pathway suppression. This is the first time we have shown the potential effect and possible mechanism of BA and CDM on the inhibition of AML tumor growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31193405>Potential antigenotoxicity assessment of  fruit.</a></h2><p> Mill. fruits are nutritionally rich and have a broad spectrum of health benefits. In this work we hypothesized that this natural product rich in polyphenols might protect humans against DNA damage and its consequences. This has led to our investigation to find out if the fruit extract showed an ability to decrease the frequency of DNA damage (antigenotoxicity) induced by two known genotoxins namely an alkylating agent methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) and a reactive  species (ROS) inducer hydrogen peroxide (HO). Human lymphocytes were incubated with the  fruit ethanol extracts (ZFE) or  (BA) followed by an exposure to either 50 μM of MMS or 250 μM of HO. Results suggest that ZFE (250, 500, 1000 μg/ml) and BA (10, 20, 40 μg/ml) were able to inhibit the DNA damaging effect caused by MMS and HO indicative of their protection against the genotoxin. This could be attributed to the interactions of the phenolics, flavonoid and BA present in the fruits. Additional  experiments were carried since BA is an important phytochemical detected in ample amounts in the fruit extract. Mice were primed with BA (2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg body weight) for a period of 6 days. The animals were injected with MMS (10 mg/kg body weight) 24 h later and sacrificed. The genotoxic activity of MMS was inhibited in a dose - related manner by BA. BA reduced the frequency of MMS - induced DNA damage in liver, kidney and bone marrow cells of mice thereby exhibiting its antigenotoxic properties. It could also reduce total glutathione level, lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide content in liver cells of mice through the up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes. Therefore taking into account the antioxidant and antigenotoxic properties, the consumption of the  fruit should be more popularized worldwide.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22180353>Betulin,  and butein are inhibitors of acetaldehyde-induced activation of liver stellate cells.</a></h2><p>Liver fibrosis has been reported to be inhibited in vivo by oleanolic and ursolic acids; however, the activity of other triterpenes like betulin and  has not been examined. Butein has also been reported to prevent and partly reverse liver fibrosis in vivo, although its mechanism of action is poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the antifibrotic potential of butein, betulin, and  and examine their mechanisms of action in vitro. This study was conducted in rat stellate cells (HSCs) that were treated with acetaldehyde, which is the most reactive product of ethanol metabolism. Butein, betulin, and  were preincubated with rat HSCs at non-toxic concentrations. Treatment effects were measured in regard to acetaldehyde-induced toxicity and cell migration, and several markers of HSC activation were evaluated, including smooth muscle α-actin (α-SMA) and procollagen I expression. In addition, changes in the release of reactive  species (ROS) and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and tumor growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and changes in the production of metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) were determined. In vitro, HSCs were protected against acetaldehyde-induced toxicity by betulin but not by  and butein. However, butein, betulin, and  inhibited the production of ROS by HSCs treated with acetaldehyde and inhibited their migration. Butein also inhibited acetaldehyde-induced TGF-β1 production. Butein, betulin, and  down-regulated acetaldehyde-induced production of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. Betulin decreased the acetaldehyde-induced activity of MMP-2, but butein and  did not. The results indicated that butein, betulin, and  inhibited the acetaldehyde-induced activation of HSCs. Each drug functioned in a different manner, whereby some were acting as either antioxidants or inhibitors of TIMPs expression and butein additionally acted as an inhibitor of TGF-β production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27131434>Dillenia suffruticosa dichloromethane root extract induced apoptosis towards MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Dillenia suffruticosa is traditionally used for treatment of cancerous growth including breast cancer in Malaysia.Dillenia suffruticosa is a well-known medicinal plant in Malaysia for the treatment of cancer. Nevertheless, no study has been reported the cytotoxicity of this plant towards MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells. The present study was designed to investigate the mode of cell death and signalling pathways of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with dichloromethane Dillenia suffruticosa root extract (DCM-DS).Extraction of Dillenia suffruticosa root was performed by the use of sequential solvent procedure. The cytotoxicity of DCM-DS was determined by using MTT assay. The mode of cell death was evaluated by using an inverted light microscope and flow cytometry analysis using Annexin-V/PI. Cell cycle analysis and measurement of reactive  species level were performed by using flow cytometry. The cells were treated with DCM-DS and antioxidants α-tocopherol or ascorbic acid to evaluate the involvement of ROS in the cytotoxicity of DCM-DS. Effect of DCM-DS on the expression of antioxidant, apoptotic, growth, survival genes and proteins were analysed by using GeXP-based multiplex system and Western blot, respectively. The cytotoxicity of compounds isolated from DCM-DS was evaluated towards MDA-MB-231 cells using MTT assay.DCM-DS induced apoptosis, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and oxidative stress in MDA-MB-231 cells. The induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells by DCM-DS is possibly due to the activation of pro-apoptotic JNK1 and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic ERK1, which in turn down-regulates anti-apoptotic BCL-2 to increase the BAX/BCL-2 ratio to initiate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The cell cycle arrest in DCM-DS-treated MDA-MB-231 cells is possibly via p53-independent but p21-dependent pathway. A total of 3 triterpene compounds were isolated from DCM-DS.  appears to be the most major and most cytotoxic compound in DCM-DS.The data suggest the potential application of DCM-DS in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential splenocytes protective effect and underlying mechanism of BA using dexamethasone (Dex)-induced mice as a model system. Pretreatment with BA (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg) dose-dependently ameliorated Dex-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis after 14 days of feeding. In addition to reactive oxygen species scavenging activity in Dex-induced splenocytes, BA administration up-regulated antioxidant enzymes, decreased lipid peroxidation, restored mitochondrial function, decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, prevented the decline of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, inhibited caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, and improved cell survival. These findings reveal that BA was able to mitigate Dex-induced oxidative stress and might play an important role in repairs of oxidative damage in immunological system.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

(BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid. The present study was designed to explore the effects of BA on OSCC KB cell proliferation in vitro and on implanted tumor growth in vivo and to examine the possible molecular mechanisms. The results showed that BA dose-dependently inhibited KB cell proliferation and decreased implanted tumor volume. In addition, BA significantly promoted mitochondrial apoptosis, as reflected by an increase in TUNEL+ cells and the activities of caspases 3 and 9, an increase in Bax expression, and a decrease in Bcl-2 expression and the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate. BA significantly increased cell population in the G0/G1 phase and decreases the S phase cell number, indicating the occurrence of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. ROS generation was significantly increased by BA, and antioxidant NAC treatment markedly inhibited the effect of BA on apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and proliferation. BA dose-dependently increased p53 expression in KB cells and implanted tumors. p53 reporter gene activity and p53 binding in the promoters of Bax were significantly increased by BA. Knockdown of p53 blocked BA-induced increase in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cell proliferation. NAC treatment suppressed BA-induced increase in p53 expression. Furthermore, phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was increased by BA. Taken together, the data demonstrated that ROS-p53 signaling was crucial for BA-exhibited antitumor effect in OSCC. BA may serve as a potential drug for the treatment of oral cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26248310>Synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel  derivative as an inducer of apoptosis in human colon carcinoma cells (HT-29).</a></h2><p>A novel family of  analogues, carrying a triazole unit at C-3 attached through a linker, was synthesized by the application of azide-alkyne "Click reaction". These were screened for their anticancer activity against different cancer cells and normal human PBMC by MTT assay. Compound 2c [(3S)-3-{2-(4-(hydroxymethyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)acetyloxy}-lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid] was found as the most potent inhibitor of cell line HT-29 with IC50 value 14.9 μM. Its role as an inducer of apoptosis was investigated in this cell line by Annexin-V/PI binding assay and by following its capability for ROS generation, depolarization of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, activation of caspases, PARP cleavage, nuclear degradation and expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. It exhibited much higher cytotoxicity than the standard drug 5-fluorouracil but showed negligible cytotoxicity towards normal PBMC. Elevated level of ROS generation, activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9, DNA fragmentation, higher expression of Bax and Bad, lower expression of Bcl2 and Bcl-xl, and increased level of Bax/Bcl-xl ratio identified 2c as a promising inducer of apoptosis that follows a mitochondria dependent pathway.

The objective of the present work was to investigate the mechanisms of mitochondrial toxicity induced by novel dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) derivatives of pentacyclic triterpenes, which were previously shown to inhibit the growth of melanoma cells in vitro. MCF-7, Hs 578T and BJ cell lines, as well as isolated hepatic mitochondria, were used to investigate direct mitochondrial effects. On isolated mitochondrial hepatic fractions, respiratory parameters, mitochondrial transmembrane electric potential, induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore and ion transport-dependent osmotic swelling were measured. Our results indicate that the DMAP triterpenoid derivatives lead to fragmentation and depolarization of the mitochondrial network in situ, and to inhibition of uncoupled respiration, induction of the permeability transition pore and depolarization of isolated hepatic mitochondria. The results show that mitochondrial toxicity is an important component of the biological interaction of DMAP derivatives, which can explain the effects observed in cancer cells.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

NO bioavailability is decreased in atherosclerosis due to increased NO inactivation by reactive  species and reduced NO synthesis. Various types of vascular pathophysiology are associated with oxidative stress, with NADPH oxidases as the major source of reactive  species. These inactivate NO. Also, oxidative stress is likely to be the main cause for oxidation of the essential NOS cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). A lack of BH(4) leads to eNOS uncoupling (i.e., uncoupling of  reduction from NO synthesis in eNOS). Based on these pathomechanisms, the therapeutic potential of a number of compounds is discussed in this review: (1) NO donors; (2) L-arginine; (3) folic acid; (4) BH(4) and its precursor sepiapterin; (5) compounds that upregulate eNOS and concomitantly maintain eNOS activity (e.g. midostaurin, , ursolic acid, AVE9488 and AVE3085); (6) compounds that enhance the de novo synthesis of BH(4) by stimulating expression or activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I; and (7) 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A inhibitors (statins) and drugs interrupting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Statins, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone and the renin inhibitor aliskiren enhance NO bioactivity and reduce atherosclerosis progression through multiple mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26469741>Self assembled nano fibers of : A selective inducer for ROS/TNF-alpha pathway mediated leukemic cell death.</a></h2><p>The main complication in  (BA) based drug delivery has been observed due to its bulk structure. The present study demonstrates the potential effects of self assembled nano size  (SA-BA) by treating human leukemic cell lines (KG-1A and K562) and its normal counterpart. Self assembly property of BA was investigated using SEM and DLS study which showed that the BA forms fibrous structure having few nanometers in diameter. Selective anti-leukemic efficacy study of SA-BA was investigated by cell viability assay. Mode of leukemic cell death and probable pathway of apoptosis was monitored by measuring ROS level, pro and anti-inflammatory cytokine status and expression of caspase-8 and caspage-3 by immunocytochemistry. Higher efficacy of SA-BA over non-assemble BA was monitored toward cancer cells, with no relevant toxicity to normal blood cells. SA-BA facilitated reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated leukemic cell death, confirmed by pre-treatment of N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Induction of apoptosis by SA-BA treatment increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically potentiated TNF-α mediated cell death, confirmed by expression of caspase-8 and caspage-3 by immunocytochemistry. This study explored the better anti-leukemic efficacy of SA-BA over BA and this modification will enrich the use of BA in cancer therapy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

All the derivatives were evaluated for cytotoxic activity by MTT assay against five different human cancer cell lines: lung (A549), colon (HCT116), prostate (PC3), pancreatic (MIA PaCa-2) and breast (T47D). The data revealed that compounds 11c, 11d, 11g, 11h and 13a possess most promising cytotoxic potential. The compound 11h was one of the most active compounds, with IC values in the range of 4-6µM against all the five cancer cell lines. The results of this study suggested that derivatives with free -OH (11c, 11d and 11g) and free -COOH (11h and 13a) substitutions in the triazole moiety introduced at the C-28 position significantly improved the anti-tumor activity and may be the favourable position to synthesize potent anticancer leads from BA. Introduction of a non polar alkyl groups at C-28 position (10, 12 and 14) resulted in the significant loss of the activity. Further, DAPI staining, ROS generation and wound healing experiments revealed that compound 11h induces apoptosis in HCT-116 cells.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was focused on deciphering the detailed molecular mechanism of BA-induced apoptosis. In the present study, results indicated that BA was highly effective against HeLa cells via induction of time-dependent apoptosis, and the authors demonstrated that the BA treatment acted through downregulating a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) subunit and suppressing the Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 after increasing the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Then, BA induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, which was consistent with the cell cycle-related protein results in which BA significantly enhanced the expression of p27Kip and p21Waf1/Cip1 in HeLa cells. This target-specific inhibition was associated with mitochondrial apoptosis, as reflected by the increased expression of Bad and caspase-9, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the decline in mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, preincubation of the cells with glutathione (antioxidant) blocked the process of apoptosis, prevented the phosphorylation of downstream substrates. These results established that ROS acted as a key factor to effect apoptosis by BA treatment in HeLa cells. Therefore, these findings demonstrated that BA induced apoptosis in HeLa cells by downregulating the expression of PI3K/Akt signaling molecules via ROS, and triggering a mitochondrial pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30578788>A derivative of  protects human Retinal Pigment Epithelial (RPE) cells from cobalt chloride-induced acute hypoxic stress.</a></h2><p>The Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) is a monolayer of cells located above the choroid. It mediates human visual cycle and nourishes photoreceptors. Hypoxia-induced oxidative stress to RPE is a vital cause of retinal degeneration such as the Age-related Macular Degeneration. Most of these retinal diseases are irreversible with no efficient treatment, therefore protecting RPE cells from hypoxia stress is an important way to prevent or slow down the progression of retinal degeneration.  (BA) and betulin (BE) are pentacyclic triterpenoids with anti-oxidative property, but little is known about their effect on RPE cells. We investigated the protective effect of BA, BE and their derivatives against cobalt chloride-induced hypoxia stress in RPE cells. Human ARPE-19 cells were exposed to BA, BE and their eighteen derivatives (named as H3H20) that we customized through replacing moieties at C3 and C28 positions. We found that cobalt chloride reduced cell viability, increased Reactive  Species (ROS) production as well as induced apoptosis and necrosis in ARPE-19 cells. Interestingly, the pretreatment of 3-O-acetyl-glycyl- 28-O-glycyl- effectively protected cells from acute hypoxia stress induced by cobalt chloride. Our immunoblotting results suggested that this derivative attenuated the cobalt chloride-induced activation of Akt, Erk and JNK pathways. All findings were further validated in human primary RPE cells. In summary, this BA derivate has protective effect against the acute hypoxic stress in human RPE cells and may be developed into a candidate agent effective in the prevention of prevalent retinal diseases.Copyright © 2018.

The present study aims at investigating whether a similar situation prevails in insulin-secreting BRIN-BD11 and rat β-cells. Exogenous H(2)O(2) (100 to 200 μM) at basal glucose concentration (1.1 to 2.8 mM) stimulated insulin secretion. The inhibitor of VRAC, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate (NPPB) inhibited the secretory response to exogenous H(2)O(2). In patch clamp experiments, exogenous H(2)O(2) was observed to stimulate NPPB-sensitive anion channel activity, which induced cell membrane depolarization. Exposure of the BRIN-BD11 cells to a hypotonic medium caused a detectable increase in intracellular level of reactive  species (ROS) that was abolished by diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), a universal NOX inhibitor. NOX inhibitors such as DPI and plumbagin nearly totally inhibited insulin release provoked by exposure of the BRIN-BD11 cells to a hypotonic medium. Preincubation with two other drugs also abolished hypotonicity-induced insulin release and reduced basal insulin output: 1) N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a glutathione precursor that serves as general antioxidant and 2)  a compound that almost totally abolished NOX4 expression. As NPPB, each of these inhibitors (DPI, plumbagin, preincubation with NAC or ) strongly reduced the volume regulatory decrease observed following a hypotonic shock, providing an independent proof that VRAC activation is mediated by H(2)O(2). Taken together, these data suggest that NOX-derived H(2)O(2) plays a key role in the insulin secretory response of BRIN-BD11 and native β-cells to extracellular hypotonicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28671831>-Targeted Lupane Triterpenoid Derivatives and Their Selective Apoptosis-Inducing Anticancer Mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Betulin and  have been widely studied for their anticancer activities.

Biological characterization established that uptake of -targeted compound 1a in the  of cancer cells was increased compared to betulin. The -targeted derivatives of betulin and  showed stronger cytotoxicity than their parent drugs and exhibited more cytotoxic effects in cancer cells than normal cells.

It is therefore of high importance to find methods to reduce cadmium accumulation in the human body. Herein, we report that administration of  (BA) protects mice from cadmium chloride (CdCl2)-induced toxicity by inhibiting cadmium-induced apoptosis in both kidney and liver. Mice were given oral doses of 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg of BA daily for ten consecutive days, and were injected with one dose of 1 mg/kg CdCl2 after one hour of BA administration every day. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were assessed by ELISA. Residual cadmium was determined by atomic absorption analysis. Protein expression was evaluated by western blotting. Pretreatment with BA significantly reduced residual cadmium levels in the liver, kidney and testis, increased the cadmium output in urine, and reduced tissue damage induced by CdCl2. Moreover, BA prevented body weight loss by CdCl2 in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, BA treatment increased the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), decreased Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), and inhibited the levels of active caspase-3. Importantly, BA within a dose of 30 mg/kg did not induce any signs of toxicity, and protected mice from the toxicity induced by CdCl2 in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that BA inhibits CdCl2 induced apoptosis in the kidney and liver, and BA may be an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of cadmium-induced diseases in humans.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Damage of the parotid glands are caused by radical  species (ROS) as by-products of  metabolism. This study investigated the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) on Carbachol (CCh)-evoked secretory responses and caspase-3 activity in the isolated rat parotid gland to understand the role of oxidative stress on the function of the gland. Amylase secretion, cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and caspase-3 activity in parotid gland tissue were measured using fluorimetric methods. H(2)O(2) had little or no effect on amylase secretion compared to basal level. Combining H(2)O(2) with CCh resulted in an attenuation of the CCh-evoked amylase secretion compared to the effect of CCh alone. CCh can evoke a large increase in [Ca(2+)](i) comprising an initial peak followed by a plateau. In a Ca(2+)-free medium containing 1 mM EGTA, CCh evoked only the initial peak of [Ca(2+)](i). H(2)O(2) alone evoked a gradual and dose-dependent increase in [Ca(2+)](i). Combining H(2)O(2) with CCh resulted in a decrease in [Ca(2+)](i) compared to the effect of CCh alone. In a Ca(2+)-free medium, H(2)O(2) still evoked a small increase in [Ca(2+)](i), but this response was less compared to the results obtained with H(2)O(2) in normal [Ca(2+)](0). Combining H(2)O(2) with CCh resulted in only a small transient increase in [Ca(2+)](i). Following CCh stimulation, H(2)O(2) application resulted in a large increase in [Ca(2+)](i) in normal [Ca(2+)](0). This effect of H(2)O(2) was partially abolished in a nominally free Calcium medium containing EGTA. H(2)O(2) can stimulate caspase-3 activity in parotid gland tissue. Similar response was obtained with  and thapsigargin (TPS) on caspase-3 activity compared to basal. The results have demonstrated that like CCh, H(2)O(2) can also mobilise Ca(2+) from intracellular stores and facilitate its influx into the cell from extracellular medium. This effect of H(2)O(2) may be due to its activity to induce apoptosis in the parotid gland, since H(2)O(2) can stimulate the activity of caspase-3, a marker of cellular apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26721359>In vivo protective effect of  on dexamethasone induced thymocyte apoptosis by reducing oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Dexamethasone (Dex), a synthetic glucocorticoid, is strictly controlled for use due to its serious side effects, including immune suppression.  (BA), an antioxidant prepared from the white birch, exhibits immunomodulation properties. To assess the implications and investigate the mechanisms of BA-elicited immunomodulation, we hypothesized that Dex induced thymocyte apoptosis via oxidative stress could be lessened by BA.Mice were given oral doses of BA (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0mg/kg) daily for 14 days, and induced oxidative stress by giving a single dose of Dex intraperitoneal at the dosage of 25mg/kg body weight 8h after the last administration of BA.Dex administration alone significantly decreased antioxidant enzyme activities, while significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunctions, caspase-3 activation and cellular apoptosis. However, pretreatment with BA dose-dependently mitigated Dex-induced oxidative damage after 14 days of feeding. In addition to ROS scavenging activity in Dex-induced thymocyte, BA administration decreased lipid peroxidation, up-regulated antioxidant enzymes, restored mitochondrial function, increased Bcl-2 expression but reduced Bax expression, inhibited caspase-3 activation, and improved cell survival.These findings reveal a protective capability of BA against Dex-induced cell death by reducing oxidative stress via mitochondrial mediated signal pathway which could be the potential mechanism underlying BA-elicited immunomodulation.Copyright © 2015 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations of betulin,  and ursolic acid against E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are 1024-, 256- and 1024-μg/mL; 512-, 256- and 256 μg/mL; 256-, 256- and 64 μg/mL respectively. Cell viability of betulin-, - and ursolic acid-treated bacteria decrease in time dependent manner. Treatment of bacteria in the presence of 2,2'-bipyrydyl increased cell viability. Superoxide anion radical production increased significantly (p < 0.05) in bacterial cells-treated with betulin,  and ursolic acid. Furthermore, NAD/NADH ratio increased significantly (p < 0.05) in betulin-, - and ursolic acid-treated bacteria. Similarly, level of reduced glutathione in E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus decreased significantly with corresponding increase in glutathione disulphide, malondialdehyde and fragmented DNA following betulin,  and ursolic acid treatments. It is evident from the above findings that betulin,  and ursolic acid enhanced electron transport chain activity in E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus leading to increased ROS generation, Fenton reaction,  peroxidation, fragmented DNA and consequentially bacterial death.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Computer-assisted sperm analysis, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy were performed to analyze changes in the acrosomal status and in apoptotic features. , thapsigargin, and the calcium ionophore treatment resulted in an increased number of sperm cells with caspase 9 and caspase 3 activation, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, and a reacted acrosome. Sperm motility was decreased in all cases. Transmission electron analyses showed ultra-morphological changes, such as membrane integrity, membrane blebbing, the formation of head vacuoles, defects of the nuclear envelope, nuclear fragmentation, and the acrosome reaction. Acrosome reaction and apoptotic features decreased due to the reduction in intracellular calcium by the calcium chelator NP-EGTA, AM.

BA triggered an apoptosis pathway different from the one previously identified for standard chemotherapeutic drugs. BA-induced apoptosis was independent of CD95-ligand/receptor interaction and accumulation of wild-type p53 protein, but it critically depended on activation of caspases (interleukin 1beta-converting enzyme/Ced-3-like proteases). FLICE/MACH (caspase-8), considered to be an upstream protease in the caspase cascade, and the downstream caspase CPP32/YAMA/Apopain (caspase-3) were activated, resulting in cleavage of the prototype substrate of caspases PARP. The broad-spectrum peptide inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, which blocked cleavage of FLICE and PARP, also completely abrogated BA-triggered apoptosis. Cleavage of caspases was preceded by disturbance of mitochondrial membrane potential and by generation of reactive  species. Overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL conferred resistance to BA at the level of mitochondrial dysfunction, protease activation, and nuclear fragmentation. This suggested that mitochondrial alterations were involved in BA-induced activation of caspases. Furthermore, Bax and Bcl-xs, two death-promoting proteins of the Bcl-2 family, were up-regulated following BA treatment. Most importantly, neuroblastoma cells resistant to CD95- and doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis were sensitive to treatment with BA, suggesting that BA may bypass some forms of drug resistance. Because BA exhibited significant antitumor activity on patients' derived neuroblastoma cells ex vivo, BA may be a promising new agent for the treatment of neuroectodermal tumors in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15057642>: a promising anticancer candidate.</a></h2><p> is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid which has demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against a number of specific tumor types, a variety of infectious agents such as HIV, malaria and bacteria, and the inflammatory process in general.

Supplemental reports suggest that the generation of reactive  species, inhibition of topoisomerase I, activation of the MAP kinase cascade, inhibition of angiogenesis, and modulation of pro-growth transcriptional activators and aminopeptidase N activity may play a role in -induced apoptosis. These potential mechanisms of action may enable  to be effective in cells resistant to other chemotherapeutic agents.

Moreover, these results support a link between the MAPKs and reactive  species (ROS). As demonstrated previously, cells treated with  generate ROS. Preincubation of cells with antioxidants blocks the process of programmed cell death, and prevents the phosphorylation of p38 and stress activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase. These data suggest that ROS act upstream of the MAPKs in the signaling pathway of . In addition to mediating these responses, treatment of cells with  resulted in a gradual depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, a phenomenon established to contribute to the induction of programmed cell death. Interestingly, p38 was capable of partially modulating this perturbation, and investigations of mitochondria-associated apoptotic events indicate no involvement of known caspases.

In hepatocytes from HBV-transgenic mice, we showed that BetA substantially inhibited HBV replication by downregulation of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) expression, with subsequent reactive  species generation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Also, the HBV X protein (HBx) is suppressed and translocated into the mitochondria followed by cytochrome c release. Further investigation revealed that SOD2 expression was suppressed by BetA-induced cAMP-response element-binding protein dephosphorylation at Ser133, which subsequently prevented SOD2 transcription through the cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding motif on the SOD2 promoter. SOD2 overexpression abolished the inhibitory effect of BetA on HBV replication, whereas SOD2 knockdown mimicked this effect, indicating that BetA-mediated HBV clearance was due to modulation of the mitochondrial redox balance. This observation was further confirmed in HBV-transgenic mice, where both BetA and PC crude extracts suppressed SOD2 expression, with enhanced reactive  species generation in liver tissues followed by substantial HBV clearance. We conclude that BetA from PC could be a good candidate for anti-HBV drug development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30413111>Ginkgolic Acid Rescues Lens Epithelial Cells from Injury Caused by Redox Regulated-Aberrant Sumoylation Signaling by Reviving Prdx6 and Sp1 Expression and Activities.</a></h2><p>Sumoylation is a downstream effector of aging/oxidative stress; excess oxidative stress leads to dysregulation of a specificity protein1 (Sp1) and its target genes, such as Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6), resulting in cellular damage. To cope with oxidative stress, cells rely on a signaling pathway involving redox-sensitive genes. Herein, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of the small molecule Ginkgolic acid (GA), a Sumoylation antagonist, to disrupt aberrant Sumoylation signaling in human and mouse lens epithelial cells (LECs) facing oxidative stress or aberrantly expressing Sumo1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier). We found that GA globally reduced aberrant Sumoylation of proteins. In contrast,  (BA), a Sumoylation agonist, augmented the process. GA increased Sp1 and Prdx6 expression by disrupting the Sumoylation signaling, while BA repressed the expression of both molecules. In vitro DNA binding, transactivation, Sumoylation and expression assays revealed that GA enhanced Sp1 binding to GC-boxes in the Prdx6 promoter and upregulated its transcription. Cell viability and intracellular redox status assays showed that LECs pretreated with GA gained resistance against oxidative stress-driven aberrant Sumoylation signaling. Overall, our study revealed an unprecedented role for GA in LECs and provided new mechanistic insights into the use of GA in rescuing LECs from aging/oxidative stress-evoked dysregulation of Sp1/Prdx6 protective molecules.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19465458>Mitochondrial membrane potential disruption pattern in human sperm.</a></h2><p>Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) in spermatozoa is correlated with high levels of reactive  species in semen, abnormal spermiogram parameters, and low success rates of IVF. In somatic cells, the loss of DeltaPsi(m) is primarily associated with several mechanisms of cell death, mainly the activation of caspases. The impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on sperm function is still not fully elucidated, although disruption of DeltaPsi(m) and activation of caspases are processes thoroughly studied in human ejaculates. Disruption of DeltaPsi(m) in sperm can be externally triggered by the antineoplastic agent  (BA). In this study, we determined whether caspase activation is necessary for the BA-induced disruption of DeltaPsi(m) in human sperm.Viable and highly motile sperm cells were selected through a swim-up process and incubated with 90 microg/ml BA. To elucidate the caspase dependency of BA-triggered disruption of DeltaPsi(m), we used the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk and the caspase-3/7 inhibitor DEVD-cho.Exposing highly motile sperm to BA caused a specific disruption of DeltaPsi(m) (P < 0.001 versus control) and a corresponding increase in caspase-3/7 activity (P < 0.001 versus control). Pre-incubation of the sperm with zVAD-fmk or DEVD-cho only partially inhibited BA-induced loss of DeltaPsi(m) (P < 0.05 versus control).We found that caspases directly participate in the loss of DeltaPsi(m) caused by BA in human sperm cells.

Here, we show that BA triggers apoptosis in five human glioma cell lines. BA-induced apoptosis requires new protein, but not RNA, synthesis, is independent of p53, and results in p21 protein accumulation in the absence of a cell cycle arrest. BA-induced apoptosis involves the activation of caspases that cleave poly(ADP ribose)polymerase. Interactions of death ligand/receptor pairs of the CD95/CD95 ligand family do not mediate BA-induced caspase activation. BA enhances the levels of BAX and BCL-2 proteins but does not alter the levels of BCL-xS or BCL-xL. Ectopic expression of BCL-2 prevents BA-induced caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and cell death. Furthermore, BA induces the formation of reactive  species that are essential for BA-triggered cell death. The generation of reactive  species is blocked by BCL-2 and requires new protein synthesis but is unaffected by caspase inhibitors, suggesting that BA toxicity sequentially involves new protein synthesis, formation of reactive  species, and activation of crm-A-insensitive caspases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19399186>Betulin is a potent anti-tumor agent that is enhanced by cholesterol.</a></h2><p> (BetA) and its derivatives have been extensively studied in the past for their anti-tumor effects, but relatively little is known about its precursor Betulin (BE).

Similar to all NOS isoforms, functional eNOS transfers electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), via the flavins flavin adenine dinucleotide and flavin mononucleotide in the carboxy-terminal reductase domain, to the heme in the amino-terminal oxygenase domain. Here, the substrate L-arginine is oxidized to L-citrulline and NO. Cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia or cigarette smoking reduce bioactive NO. These risk factors lead to an enhanced production of reactive  species (ROS) in the vessel wall. NADPH oxidases represent major sources of this ROS and have been found upregulated in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. NADPH-oxidase-derived superoxide avidly reacts with eNOS-derived NO to form peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)). The essential NOS cofactor (6R-)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4) ) is highly sensitive to oxidation by this ONOO(-). In BH(4) deficiency,  reduction uncouples from NO synthesis, thereby converting NOS to a superoxide-producing enzyme. Among conventional drugs, compounds interfering with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and statins can reduce vascular oxidative stress and increase bioactive NO. In recent years, we have identified a number of small molecules that have the potential to prevent eNOS uncoupling and, at the same time, enhance eNOS expression. These include the protein kinase C inhibitor midostaurin, the pentacyclic triterpenoids ursolic acid and , the eNOS enhancing compounds AVE9488 and AVE3085, and the polyphenolic phytoalexin trans-resveratrol. Such compounds enhance NO production from eNOS also under pathophysiological conditions and may thus have therapeutic potential.© 2011 The Authors.

Derivatives bearing terpene-terminated 6-alkyl residues were tested in cells of human HL-60 leukemia, 518A2 melanoma, multidrug-resistant KB-V1/Vbl cervix, and MCF-7/Topo breast carcinomas, as well as in non-malignant human foreskin fibroblasts. Derivatives with a short four-atom spacer between quinone and cyclic monoterpene moieties were more antiproliferative than analogues with longer spacers. 6-(Menthoxybutyryl)thymoquinone (3a) exhibited single-digit micromolar IC(50) (72 h) values in all four cell lines. It was seven times more active than TQ (1) in 518A2 melanoma cells and four times in KB-V1/Vbl cervix carcinoma cells, while only half as toxic in the fibroblasts. Compound 3a was also not a substrate for the P-gp and BCRP drug transporters of the resistant cancer cells. The caryophyllyl and germacryl conjugates 3e and 3f specifically inhibited the growth of the resistant MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. Conjugation of TQ with the triterpene  via the OH group as in 3g led to a loss in activity, while conjugation via the carboxylic acid afforded compound 4 with nanomolar IC(50) (72 h) activity against HL-60 cells.

However, it is not clear whether these bio-active ingredients can significantly contribute to the protection of embryonic stem (ES) cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. In the present study, hypoxia-induced ES cells apoptosis with time, which were abrogated by pretreatment with all ingredients. Hypoxia-induced ROS generation was blocked by pretreatment with all ingredients in a dose-dependent manner, with the maximum ROS scavenging effect observed for delphinidin. Hypoxia increased phosphorylation of JNK and NF-κB were blocked by pretreatment of delphinidin as well as NAC. Hypoxia decreased phosphorylation of Akt(thr308) and (ser473); these decreases were reversed by pretreatment with delphinidin or NAC. However, Akt inhibition did not affect NF-κB phosphorylation. Delphinidin attenuated the hypoxia-induced increase in Bax, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, and decrease in Bcl-2, which were diminished by pretreatment of Akt inhibitor. Hypoxia induced Bax translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria. Furthermore, hypoxia induced mitochondria membrane potential loss and cytochrome c release in cytosol, which were blocked by delphinidin pretreatment. Hypoxia induced cleavage of procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 which were blocked by delphinidin or SP600125, but Akt inhibitor abolished the protection effect of delphinidin. Moreover, inhibition of JNK and NF-κB abolished hypoxia-induced ES cell apoptosis and inhibition of Akt attenuated delphinidin-induced blockage of apoptosis. The results indicate that delphinidin can prevent hypoxia-induced apoptosis of ES cells through the inhibition of JNK and NF-κB phosphorylation, and restoration of Akt phosphorylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360210>Cytotoxicity of Crude Extract and Isolated Constituents of the  Bark towards Multifactorial Drug-Resistant Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>The effectiveness of anticancer chemotherapy is greatly impeded by the resistance of malignant cells to cytotoxic drugs.

Assessments of cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and reactive  species (ROS) were performed by flow cytometry. Constituents of DCB were isolated by column chromatography. Triterpenoid  and flavone  had cytotoxic effects towards the 9 tested cancer cell lines with IC values below 50 M.

However, the effects of BA on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remain unclear. Hence, this study was to investigate the effects of BA on oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) induced neuronal injury in rat hippocampal neurons. Our results showed that BA pretreatment greatly attenuated OGD/R-induced neuronal injury. BA also inhibited OGD/R-induced intracellular ROS production and MDA level in rat hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the down-regulation of Bcl-2, up-regulation of Bax and the consequent activation of caspase-3 induced by OGD/R were reversed by BA pretreatment. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that BA pretreatment up-regulated the expression levels of p-PI3K and p-Akt in hippocampal neurons induced by OGD/R. Taken together, these data suggested that BA inhibits OGD/R-induced neuronal injury in rat hippocampal neurons through the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Evidence is accumulating that BA is cytotoxic against multiple types of human cancer cells; however, its effects on renal carcinoma cells remain obscure. This study aimed to evaluate the anticancer activity of BA in human renal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, we found that BA inhibited renal cancer cell proliferation in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner in vitro. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis revealed that BA affected the survival of renal cancer cells via the induction of apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that the occurrence of apoptosis was associated with upregulation of Bcl2-associated X protein and cleaved caspase-3 and downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 in renal cancer cells. Additionally, BA treatment augmented the production of reactive oxygen species and induced a significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in renal cancer cells, suggesting that BA may trigger apoptosis via the -mediated apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, the migrative and invasive capabilities of renal cancer cells were markedly repressed by BA treatment, which was related to upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, MMP9, and vimentin, and downregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and E-cadherin. Notably, administration of BA retarded tumor growth in 786-O-bearing mice in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrated the anticancer potential of BA in human renal cancer cells by triggering apoptosis and suppressing migration and invasion.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26013878>PI3K target based novel cyano derivative of  induces its signalling inhibition by down-regulation of pGSK3β and cyclin D1 and potentially checks cancer cell proliferation.</a></h2><p>In spite of the  (BA) being recognized as anticancerous source; its further use in clinical development is greatly hampered because of its poor pharmacokinetic properties. To circumvent these limitations, we synthesized a PI3K target based library of 18 triazole based derivatives and we identified a C-3 cyano analog of  (CBA) with significant cell death effects with 5-7 fold higher potency than BA in various cancers. Importantly, no such report is available demonstrating the involvement of BA or its structural analogs in the modulation of PI3K pathway. Using, human leukemia HL-60 cells as a model, we for the first time report that CBA decreased expression of PI3K p110α, p85α, and pAKT in HL-60. Furthermore, we could find significant depletion of pGSK3β, cyclin D1 and increased expression of p21/cip, p27/Kip proteins. CBA induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, increased sub-G0 DNA fraction and annexin V binding of the cells besides imparting the typical surface features of cell death. Also, this target specific inhibition was associated with mitochondrial apoptosis as was reflected by expression studies of various proteins together with reactive oxygen species generation and decline in mitochondrial trans membrane potential. The apoptotic effectors i.e., caspase 8 and caspase 9 were found to get upregulated besides PI3K associated DNA repair enzyme i.e., PARP cleavage was observed. Thus, our results elucidated that CBA or other BA based small molecules inhibit PI3K/AKT pathway with induction of subsequent cancer cell death which may be useful therapeutic strategy against leukemias and possibly other cancers.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20872792> inhibits high glucose-induced vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation and migration.</a></h2><p>The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells may perform a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disease. The principal objective of this study was to determine the effects of  (BA) on human aortic smooth muscle cell (HASMC) proliferation induced by high glucose (HG). In this study, [(3) H]-thymidine incorporation under 25 mM HG was accelerated significantly as compared with 5.5 mM glucose, and this increase was inhibited significantly by BA treatment. We utilized Western blotting analysis to evaluate the effects of BA on cell-cycle regulatory proteins. HG induced the expression of cyclins/CDKs and reduced the expression of p21(waf1/cip1) /p27(kip1). However, BA also attenuated the expression of HG-induced cell-cycle regulatory proteins. The results of gelatin zymography demonstrated that the HG-treated HASMC secreted gelatinases, probably including MMP-2/-9, which may be involved in the invasion and migration of HASMC. Additionally, BA suppressed the protein and mRNA expression levels of MMP-2/-9 in a dose-dependent manner. BA inhibited the production of HG-induced hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and the formation of DCF-sensitive intracellular reactive  species (ROS). Further, BA suppressed the nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of IκB-α of NF-κB under HG conditions. Our results showed that BA exerts multiple effects on HG-induced HASMC proliferation and migration, including the inhibition of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 transcription, protein activity, and the downregulation of ROS/NF-κB signaling, thereby suggesting that BA may be a possible therapeutic approach to the inhibition of diabetic vascular disease.Copyright © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21907795> ameliorates endothelium-dependent relaxation in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats by reducing oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Zizyphi Spinosi semen (ZSS) is one of the most widely used traditional Chinese herbs with protective effects on the cardiovascular system. It is not clear whether  (BA), the key active constituent of ZSS, has beneficial cardiovascular effects on N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME)-induced hypertensive rats. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of BA on endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in isolated aortic rings from L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats and its underlying mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with L-NAME (15 mg/kg/d, i.p.) for 4 weeks to induce hypertension. After treatment with L-NAME for 2 weeks, rats with mean blood pressure >120 mm Hg measured by tail-cuff method were considered hypertensive and then injected with BA (0.8, 4, 20 mg/kg/d, i.p.) for the last 2 weeks. The effect of BA on the tension of rat thoracic aortic rings was measured in an organ bath system. The levels of nitric oxide (NO), reactive  species (ROS), and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in aortas were assayed. We found that BA (0.1-100 μM) evoked a concentration-dependent vasorelaxation in endothelium-intact normal rat aortic rings, which was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with L-NAME (100 μM) or methylene blue (MB, 10 μM), but not by indomethacin (10 μM). Pretreatment with EC(50) (1.67 μM) concentration of BA enhanced the acetylcholine (ACh)-induced vasorelaxation, which was also markedly reversed by both L-NAME and MB. The blood pressure in hypertensive rats increased to 135.22±5.38 mm Hg (P<0.01 vs. control group), which was markedly attenuated by high dose of BA. The ACh-induced vasorelaxation in hypertensive rat aortic rings was impaired, which was markedly improved by chronic treatment with BA (20 mg/kg/d) for 2 weeks. The increase of ROS level and the decrease of NO level, SOD and eNOS activities in hypertensive rat aortas were all markedly inhibited by BA. These results indicate that BA decreased blood pressure and improved ACh-induced endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in L-NAME-induced hypertension rats, which may be mediated by reducing oxidative stress and retaining the bioavailability of NO in the cardiovascular system.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although their effects on multiple pathways have been reported, unifying mechanisms of action have not been reported. Studies in this laboratory have now demonstrated that several triterpenoids including BA and some derivatives, celastrol, methyl ursolate, β-boswellic acid derivatives, and the synthetic analogs CDDO, CDODA and their esters decreased expression of specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors and several pro-oncogenic Sp-regulated genes in multiple cancer cell lines. The mechanisms of this response are both compound- and cell context-dependent and include activation of both proteasome-dependent and -independent pathways. Triterpenoid-mediated induction of reactive  species (ROS) has now been characterized as an important proteasome-independent pathway for downregulation of Sp transcription factors. ROS decreases expression of microRNA-27a (miR-27a) and miR-20a/miR-17-5p and this results in the induction of the transcriptional "Sp-repressors" ZBTB10 and ZBTB4, respectively, which in turn downregulate Sp and Sp-regulated genes. Triterpenoids also activate or deactive nuclear receptors and G-protein coupled receptors, and these pathways contribute to their antitumorigenic activity and may also play a role in targeting Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 which are highly overexpressed in multiple cancers and appear to be important for maintaining the cancer phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172400>Betulin and  attenuate ethanol-induced liver stellate cell activation by inhibiting reactive  species (ROS), cytokine (TNF-α, TGF-β) production and by influencing intracellular signaling.</a></h2><p>Liver fibrosis has been reported to be inhibited in vivo by oleanolic and ursolic acids.

In this study, we aimed to determine the antifibrotic potential of other triterpenes, betulin and , and to characterize their influence on the signal transduction pathways involved in ethanol-activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).Investigated was the influence of preincubation of rat HSCs with betulin and , at non-toxic concentrations, on ethanol-induced toxicity, migration, and several markers of HSC activation such as smooth muscle α-actin (α-SMA) and procollagen I expression, release of reactive  species (ROS) and cytokines: tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and tumor growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and production of metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2). To assess the mechanism of the action of those triterpenes, intracellular signals such as nuclear factor-κB (NFκB), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) induced by ethanol were examined.In vitro, betulin, but not , protected HSCs against ethanol toxicity. However, both betulin and  inhibited the production of ROS by HSCs treated with ethanol and inhibited their migration as well as ethanol-induced TNF-α, and TGF-β1, production. Betulin and  down-regulated ethanol-induced production of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. Betulin and , also decreased ethanol-induced activity of MMP-2. In ethanol-induced HSCs, betulin inhibited the activation of the p38 MAPK and the JNK transduction pathways, while  inhibited the JNK transduction pathway only. They also significantly inhibited phosphorylation of IκB and Smad 3 and attenuated the activation of TGF-β1 and NFκB/IκB transduction signaling.The results indicated that betulin and  inhibited ethanol-induced activation of HSCs on different levels, acting as antioxidants, inhibitors of cytokine production, and inhibitors of TGF-β, and NFκB/IκB transduction signaling. Betulin was also inhibitor of both JNK and p38 MAPK signal transduction, while  inhibited only JNK.

This study was conducted to evaluate the potency of self-assembled  (SA-BA) against DOX induced chemotherapeutic toxicity in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). The isolated  from the bark of Ziziphus jujuba tree was purified by column chromatography and characterized by FT-IR, XRD, (1)H NMR and self-assembly property was investigated by SEM imaging. DOX treatment produced significant reduction of viability of PBLs mainly by lowering cellular anti-oxidant pool and elevating the reactive oxygen species level. Pre-treatment with SA-BA followed by DOX exposure for 24h protected the PBLs from DOX induced oxidative stress. Potent anti-apoptotic role of SA-BA was also confirmed by FACS analysis and western blot assay. Severe inflammation is one of the major concerns in DOX treatment. We found that pre-treatment with SA-BA on PBLs significantly protected the PBLs from DOX induced inflammation.

All six fractions were evaluated for their in-vitro anticancer activity in nine different cancer cell lines and ethyl acetate fraction was found to be one of the most potent fractions in terms of inducing cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines. By utilizing column chromatography, six triterpenes namely betulin, , lupeol, ursolic acid (UA), oleanolic acid and β-amyrin have been isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of BUB and structures of these compounds were unraveled by spectroscopic methods. β-amyrin and UA were isolated for the first time from Betula utilis. Isolated triterpenes were tested for in-vitro cytotoxic activity against six different cancer cell lines where UA was found to be selective for breast cancer cells over non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A). Tumor cell selective apoptotic action of UA was mainly attributed due to the activation of extrinsic apoptosis pathway via up regulation of DR4, DR5 and PARP cleavage in MCF-7 cells over non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells. Moreover, UA mediated intracellular ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential disruption also play a key role for its anti cancer effect. UA also inhibits breast cancer migration.

In particular, the poor prognosis is due to the lack of therapeutic efficacy of chemical agents and irradiation in hypoxic tumor areas. New therapeutic strategies could improve the treatment of glioblastoma. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of a conjugate of cisplatin (DDP), a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, and  (BA), a natural product from plane tree bark, in glioblastoma cells under different  conditions. We investigated the effects of the BA-DDP conjugate κN',N''-{3-acetyloxy-BA-28-[2-(2-aminoethyl)aminoethyl]amide} dichlorido platinum(II) (APC) and its precursor 3-acetyloxy-BA-28-[2-(2-aminoethyl)aminoethyl]amide (DE9B) on cytotoxicity, cell growth, apoptosis, migration and radiosensitivity compared to BA or DDP alone under different  conditions. Based on the EC values, the precursor DE9B exhibited the strongest cytotoxic effects of the analyzed chemotherapeutic agents. The BA-DDP conjugate APC achieved a moderate cytotoxic effect in glioma cells. Both of the newly developed agents induced cell growth delay, apoptosis and inhibition of migration. Furthermore, additive effects could be achieved in combination with irradiation. In contrast to those of BA and DDP, the cell biological effects of APC and DE9B were not influenced by the  concentration. In this study, the linking of BA and DDP did not produce a compound with additive therapeutic effects on glioblastoma cell lines in vitro. Nevertheless, the results of this study suggest that the precursor DE9B is an effective BA derivative for the treatment of glioblastoma in vitro.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated apoptosis was determined by examining the changes in the intracellular calcium content, the reactive  species accumulation, the cytochrome c release, the upregulation of Bcl-2-associated-X protein (Bax) and caspase 3, the downregulation of B cell lymphoma 2, and the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) depolarization. Apoptosis was also verified by acridine orange staining observed under fluorescence microscopy and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining through flow cytometric studies. The levels of intracellular adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate ratio decreased, and the ATPase activity increased more strikingly in A549 cells exposed to NdBA than in A549 cells exposed to dBA. Overall results showed that both drugs directly target the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system, with NdBA having a stronger effect, indicating NdBA to be a better candidate for the development of an anticancer drug for use against lung adenocarcinomas.Copyright © 2013.

Recently,  and its derivatives have attracted attention because they showed anti-cancer effects via a ROS- and -related mechanism. However, the source of ROS overproduction and the role of  were poorly identified, and the weak in vivo antitumour activity of these compounds limits their development as drugs.Cytotoxicity was detected using MTT assays. In vivo anti-HCC effects were assessed using nude mice bearing HepG2 tumour xenografts. Cell cycle analysis, apoptosis rate and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry. ROS production was detected using a microplate reader or a fluorescence microscope. Changes in gene and protein levels were measured by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Other assays were performed using related detection kits.B5G9, a piperazidine derivative of 23-hydroxy  (23-HBA), showed excellent in vivo anti-HCC effects, with a tumour growth inhibitory rate of greater than 80%, and no significant side effects. B5G9 stimulated the production of ROS, which were derived from the , but it had no effect on various other antioxidant systems. Moreover, B5G9 induced mitochondrial dysfunction, which was characterized by morphological changes, membrane potential collapse, membrane permeabilization, and decreases in the O consumption rate and ATP production. Furthermore, mtDNA-depleted ρ0 HepG2 cells were less sensitive to B5G9 treatment than wt HepG2 cells, indicating the importance of  in B5G9-induced cell death.We discovered a piperazidine derivative of 23-HBA, B5G9, with excellent anti-HCC effects both in vivo and in vitro and no obvious toxic effects. The underlying mechanism was associated with -derived ROS overproduction, and  played essential roles in B5G9-induced cell death. This study identified a potential agent for anti-HCC therapy and elucidated the -related mechanism of BA and its derivatives.</p></html>
