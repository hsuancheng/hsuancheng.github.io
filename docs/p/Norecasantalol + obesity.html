Along with , diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile acid metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty acids caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on liver damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Anthropometric measurements, body composition (BIA), aerobic capacity (VO2 max) and food preferences were assessed in 19 healthy normal-weight young adults (21 ± 0.5 years old, 10 men). They randomly completed 3 experimental sessions: i) control session without exercise (CON); ii) High Intensity exercise session (HIE); iii) Low intensity exercise session (LIE). Thirty minutes after exercise or rest, then received a fixed lunch. Food reward (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire) was assessed before and after the meal. Appetite sensations were assessed at regular intervals, SQ was calculated from the lunch meal and self-reported food intake was collected for the rest of the day. Mean body weight was 66.7 ± 9.2 kg, body mass index was 22.3 ± 2.9 kg/m and FM% was 18.7 ± 6.8%. Appetite feelings did not differ between conditions and were not affected by exercise. SQ for satiety was not different between conditions. SQ hunger on CON was significantly higher than on LIE and HIE (p ≤ 0.05) with no difference between exercise conditions. SQ for desire to eat was significantly higher on CON versus HIE (p ≤ 0.01) with no differences between CON and LIE and between exercise sessions. SQ PFC was significantly lower on HIE compared with CON (p = 0.02) with no differences between LIE and CON and between LIE and HIE. Food reward was not significantly different between the three condition as well as self-reported total food and macronutrient intake for the rest of the days. Acute exercise, depending on its intensity, might affect the satiating response to food intake in healthy adults, without altering food reward.Copyright © 2019.

Many prospective studies have reported the benign condition relating the MHO phenotype and its potential role in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. However, inconsistent results were found and the question remains controversial. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the associations these associations from relevant prospective studies.The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015 statement was used to prepare this protocol. MEDLINE, Web of Science databases, EMBASE and Cochrane Database will be used for literature search from their inception up to December 2019 with restriction of published studies in English. Published prospective studies reporting adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates for the association between MHO phenotype and cardiovascular disease, total cancer, all-cause or cause-specific mortality will be included. The process of study screening, selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers, and the risk of bias for the studies included will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. HRs or RRs for disease events and mortality with 95% CIs will be considered as primary outcomes, and summary HRs/RRs will be pooled using random-effects models. The Cochrane's Q and the I statistics will be used to assess and quantify heterogeneity, respectively. Subgroup analysis will also be carried out according to study characteristics to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity.As this meta-analysis is performed based on the published studies, no ethical approval and patient safety considerations are required.

Our objective was to determine the rate of delayed graft function (DGF) in patients on preoperative PD. Additionally, we sought to identify which patients can safely have their PD catheter removed during transplantation due to a low risk of DGF.We conducted a retrospective observational study between June 2011 and December 2015. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of DGF, defined as the need for dialysis within the first week of transplantation. Clinical and transplant factors, including graft type and donor criteria, were assessed for association with the primary outcome. Catheter-related complication rates were also compared between post-transplant PD and hemodialysis (HD).Of our cohort of 567 patients, 145 patients (25.6%) developed DGF.  (odds ratio [OR] 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.11; p=0.04) and increased perioperative blood loss (OR 1.002; 95% CI 1.000-1.003; p=0.03) were predictors of DGF. Protective factors included living donor (LD) grafts (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05-0.49; p=0.002) and intraoperative graft urine production (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.23-0.65; p<0.001). In our PD cohort, only LD grafts demonstrated lower DGF rates (0 LD vs. 20.8% deceased donor; p=0.003). In terms of post-transplant renal replacement therapy, patients on PD and HD had similar duration of temporary dialysis (one day PD vs. two days HD; p=0.48) and catheter-related complication rates (4.5% PD vs. 2.6% HD; p=0.30).Carefully selected patients, such as those receiving LD grafts, may benefit from concurrent PD catheter removal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663251>Microbiome-immune-metabolic axis in the epidemic of childhood : Evidence and opportunities.</a></h2><p> epidemic responsible for increase in diabetes, heart diseases, infections and cancer shows no signs of abating.  in children is also on rise, indicating the urgent need of strategies for prevention and intervention that must begin in early life.

Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with  had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with , muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with  had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS.

Since the role of cardiac steatosis  in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF. Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 months before the study. Electron microscopy of the atrium of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small lipid droplets around mitochondrial chains, and 5- to 9-fold greater atrial triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared to wildtype (Wt) mice. Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in significantly higher prevalence of sustained (>5 min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-month-old) mice. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated discs in Wt atria, but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg atria compared with Wt atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF susceptibility. The results suggest that PLIN2-induced steatosis is associated with Cx43 remodeling, impaired conduction propagation, and higher incidence of AF in aged mice. Therapies targeting cardiac steatosis could be potentially beneficial against AF in patients with  or diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658819>Body Mass Index Change Between Referral to and Enrollment in Pediatric Weight Management.</a></h2><p>This study describes changes in body mass index  score (BMI) and percent of 95th percentile (P95) between referral to pediatric weight management (PWM) and initial PWM visit.

Major facilitator superfamily domain 3 (MFSD3) is a family of membrane-bound solute carriers whose expression has been recently associated with nutrient intake and adipose tissue homeostasis. This study aimed to evaluate a possible association between MFSD3 preoperative methylation pattern and weight regain after bariatric surgery.This is a longitudinal study comprising 24 obese (body mass index > 35 m/kg) women submitted to gastric bypass. Anthropometric measurements were evaluated at preoperative time and 1, 2, and 3 y after surgery, and then weight regain was calculated. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes and was bisulfite modified by specific kits, according manufacturer's instructions. Methylation analysis was performed with the Infinium Human Methylation 450 K bead chip technology, and methylation level was expressed as a β value ranging from 0 (unmethylated) to 1 (fully methylated). Shapiro-Wilk, repeated-means analysis of variance, Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney, and independent t tests were used in statistical analysis (P < 0.05).A total of 25% of patients regained significant weight. Weight regain after bariatric surgery was positively correlated with cg00010266 MFSD3 preoperative methylation levels (r = 0.6804, P = 0.0126). Moreover, cg00010266 MFSD3 baseline methylation levels were significantly higher in regainer patients than non-regainers (6.2 ± 1.5 versus 3.9 ± 1.2%, P = 0.026). Patients allocated in the higher cg00010266 MFSD3 preoperative methylation group had higher weight regain (4.1 ± 1.8 versus 6.7 ± 2.2 kg, P = 0.037).Preoperative hypermethylation of MFSD3 gene is significantly associated with weight regain and a worse response to gastric bypass.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this review, the beneficial effects of pterostilbene on diabetes, liver steatosis and dyslipidemia are summarized. Pterostilbene is a useful bioactive compound in preventing type 1 diabetes, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in animal models. Concerning type 1 diabetes, the main mechanisms described to justify the positive effects of this phenolic compound are increased liver glycogen content and hepatic glucokinase and phosphofructokinase activities, the recovery of pancreatic islet architecture, cytoprotection and a decrease in serum and pancreatic pro-inflammatory cytokines. As for type 2 diabetes, increased liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase and decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activities are reported. When insulin resistance is induced by diets, a greater activation of insulin signaling cascade has been reported, increased cardiotrophin-1 levels and liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities, and a decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activity. Data concerning pterostilbene and liver steatosis are scarce so far, but the reduction in oxidative stress induced by pterostilbene may be involved since oxidative stress is related to the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis. Finally, pterostilbene effectivelly reduces total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels, while increases HDL-cholesterol in animal models of dyslipidemia.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657069>The moderator effect of age in the association between mood and adiposity in the elderly is specific for the subcutaneous adipose compartment: an MRI study.</a></h2><p>The positive association between  and depressive mood in young and middle age individuals is a phenomenon with major clinical implications in public health. Interestingly, the trend of this association in older individuals is not clear, given the conflicting results of multiple studies. Since aging is accompanied by changes in body fat distribution, we questioned whether age is a modulator of such association. This study explores the role of age in the association between mood and general (BMI) and abdominal adiposity (waist circumference - WC) in older adults characterizing the different abdominal adipose tissue compartments (subcutaneous adipose tissue - SAT and visceral adipose tissue - VAT) with magnetic resonance imaging techniques (MRI).120 aged community-dwelling individuals, (≥50 year of age), were assessed regarding depressive mood (Geriatric depression scale), and adiposity (BMI and WC). From these, 96 were assessed for SAT and VAT using MRI.Using multiple linear regression models depressive mood was positively associated with BMI, WC and VAT. Age was a significant moderator of the association between depressive mood and BMI, WC and SAT: positive in younger participants and null or negative the older. On the other hand, higher VAT was significantly associated with a more depressive mood, independently of age.This study identifies age as a relevant moderator in the association between depressive mood and adiposity in the elderlies. Furthermore, the body fat compartment analysis revealed that the effect of age is specific for the SAT, suggesting its protective role in depressive mood.This article is protected by copyright.

Sargaquinoic acid (SQA) is a major component in MES. We investigated the effects of SQA on the differentiation of preadipocytes to the beige adipocytes. SQA was treated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated under a special condition that has been reported to induce the browning of adipocytes. SQA at 10 µM reduced lipid accumulation by approximately 23%. SQA at 2.5 - 10 µM induced the differentiation of white adipocytes to beige adipocytes partially by increasing the mitochondrial density and the expression of beige/brown adipocyte markers. In addition, SQA activated lipid catabolic pathways, evidenced by the increased expression levels of perilipin, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1. As a partial mechanism, biochemical and  analyses indicate that SQA activated AMP-activated protein kinase signaling in adipocytes.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655323>Night-time cardiac autonomic modulation as a function of sleep-wake stages is modified in otherwise healthy overweight adolescents.</a></h2><p>Even though sympathetic dominance during the daytime period is well known, currently, scarce data exist on autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation during sleep in pediatric . We aimed to evaluate sleep cardiac ANS regulation in normal-weight (NW) and overweight and obese (OW) adolescents.In this study, 60 healthy adolescents (15.7 ± 0.7 years) belonging to a birth cohort since infancy were classified based on body mass index percentiles criteria as: OW (N = 27) or NW (N = 33). Sleep was evaluated by polysomnography (PSG) during two consecutive in-lab overnight sessions. Non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep stages (stages 1, 2, and slow-wave sleep [SWS]), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and wakefulness (Wake) were scored. R-waves were detected automatically in the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal. An all-night heart rate variability analysis was conducted in the ECG signal, with several time- and frequency-domain measures calculated for each sleep-wake stage. Sleep time was divided into thirds (T1, T2, T3). The analysis was performed using a mixed-effects linear regression model.Sleep organization was comparable except for reduced REM sleep percentage in the OW group (p < 0.04). Shorter R-R intervals were found for all sleep stages in the OW group; time-domain measured standard deviation of all R-R intervals (RRSD) was lower during stage 2, SWS and REM sleep (all p < 0.05). The square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent R-R intervals (RMSSD) was also lower only during wake after sleep onset (WASO) in T1 and T3 (p < 0.05). The OW group had increased very low- and low-frequency (LF) power during WASO (in T1 and T2), and LF power during stage 2 and REM sleep (in T2). During WASO in the OW group, high-frequency (HF) power was lower (in T1 and T2), and LF/HF ratio was higher (in T2, p < 0.007).Several sleep-stage-dependent changes in cardiac autonomic regulation characterized the OW group. As sleep-related ANS balance was disturbed in the absence of concomitant metabolic alterations in this sample of otherwise healthy OW adolescents, their relevance for pediatric  should be further explored throughout development.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Participants completed an online survey about EWC awareness, its perceived effectiveness among parents and their meal planning practices (attitudes, behaviours and self-efficacy).A federal mass-media campaign disseminated by Health Canada (2013-2014) to promote meal planning to Canadian parents.Parents (n 964) of children aged 2-12 years from all Provinces and Territories.Of respondents, 41 % (390/964) were aware of the campaign; Quebec City and rural Quebec had the highest rates of awareness, whereas Vancouver, Winnipeg and Toronto had the lowest. Awareness was greater among parents with lower income, basic education and French-speakers. Campaign intensity was significantly associated with greater odds of reporting positive attitudes towards the EWC and meal planning (P < 0·05). Campaign awareness was significantly associated with greater odds of believing that meal planning helps maintain a healthy diet (OR = 1·68, 95 % CI 1·03, 2·74) and planning meals (OR = 1·66, 95 % CI 1·03, 2·54), but not self-efficacy, in adjusted models.The present study is the first to evaluate an initiative that promoted meal planning with mass media. The EWC demonstrated evidence of success in terms of equitable access to a nutrition initiative by reaching lower-income and less-educated parents. Understanding behavioural factors among different segments of the population will be important to target appropriate audiences and develop tailored interventions that support healthy eating practices.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654405>Weight bias and grading among middle and high school teachers.</a></h2><p>Weight bias is a pervasive problem for adolescents in school contexts. Despite evidence of negative attitudes towards students who are overweight, comparatively little research has examined whether teachers provide biased assessments of student work.The purpose of this study was to experimentally test whether middle and high school teachers unfairly assess students who are overweight and perceive them to be less competent.Participants included 133 teachers from first-ring suburban middle and high schools (M  = 16 years; 38% male).Teachers evaluated the quality of a bogus student essay assignment accompanied by photographs that portrayed the student as either not overweight or overweight. Weight bias was assessed by having teachers grade the essay and provide perceptions of student sufficiency (perceived effort, need for tutoring, and overall success in school). Opinions about bias in grading for other teachers and self were also assessed.Essays for students who were overweight were judged to be similar in structural quality, but were assigned lower grades compared to their healthy weight counterparts. Further, teachers estimated that students who were overweight put forth more effort, needed more remedial assistance, and had lower overall grades in school. Teachers' beliefs about grading bias showed low levels of supposed bias among other teachers and a significantly lesser degree for themselves.This study confirms prior research on anti-fat attitudes and provides new evidence of biased attitudes in school settings.© 2019 The British Psychological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662362>Risk factors for cardiovascular disease in rural South India: cohort study.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) accounted for one-third of the deaths in India.

We did baseline (2005-2007) and two follow-up surveys in 2008-2009 and 2013-2015. Risk factors studied were tobacco, alcohol, hypertension, self-reported diabetes and central .Outcome measures were fatal or non-fatal ischaemic heart disease or cerebrovascular event. We estimated HRs for the risk factors and population attributable fraction (PAF).We followed up 5641 (94.4%) subjects, and follow-up duration was 33 371 person years. The overall incidence of cardiovascular event or death was 4.6 per 1000 person years. Current smoking (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6) and hypertension (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.4) were the risk factors among men and accounted for 47% of the PAF. Among women, hypertension (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.4), self-reported diabetes (HR 4.3, 95% CI 2.2 to 8.1) and central  (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.0) were associated with CVD and accounted for more than half of the PAF.We described the high burden of fatal CVD and identified the role of CVD risk factors such as hypertension, self-reported diabetes, smoking and central . There is an urgent need to implement low-cost interventions such as smoking cessation and treat hypertension and diabetes in primary care settings.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti- effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against  and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655530>Relationship of mesenteric panniculitis with visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Mesenteric panniculitis (MP) is an idiopathic benign disease characterized by fat necrosis, chronic inflammation and fibrosis.

Furthermore, -related adipokines have been shown to be closely related to the incidence of CRC, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of high-fat diet-induced adipokines and cytokines on the development of CRC in vitro and in vivo. For the in-vivo assays, we divided 2-week-old C57BL/6J-ApcMin/J male mice into three groups: normal-fat diet (ND), high-fat and high-sugar feed (HFHS), and high-fat and low-sugar feed (HFLS). After 1 week, all mice were injected with 20 mg/kg 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine once weekly for 10 consecutive weeks. Body weight, liver weight, epididymal fat weight, and blood glucose level were greatly increased in HFHS and HFLS groups compared with the ND group, and the expression levels of some adipokines and cytokines were obviously higher in HFHS or HFLS mice compared to ND mice. For the in-vitro assays, HCT116 CRC cells were treated with sera of ND, HFHS, or HFLS groups, or serum-free media (SFM) as a negative control. We observed that sera derived from HFHS or HFLS mice that contain excess adipokines and cytokines promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCT116 cells compared with ND-sera-conditioned medium or SFM group. Therefore, high-fat diet-induced adipokines and cytokines may promote the progression of CRC in vivo and in vitro.© 2019 The Authors.

As effective pharmacological treatment has recently been developed, diagnosing LepR deficiency is urgent. However, recognition is challenging and prevalence is unknown. We aim to elucidate the clinical spectrum and to estimate prevalence of LepR deficiency in Europe.Comprehensive epidemiologic analysis and systematic literature review.We curated a list of LEPR variants described in patients and elaborately evaluated their phenotypes. Subsequently, we extracted allele frequencies from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), consisting of sequencing data of 77,165 European individuals. We then calculated the number of individuals with biallelic disease-causing LEPR variants.Worldwide, 86 patients with LepR deficiency are published. We add two new patients, bringing the total of published patients to 88, of which 21 are European. All patients had early-onset ; 96% had hyperphagia; 34% had one or more pituitary hormone deficiencies. Our calculation results in 998 predicted patients in Europe, corresponding to a prevalence of 1.34 per 1 million people (95% CI 0.95-1.72).This study shows that LepR deficiency is more prevalent in Europe (n=998 predicted patients) than currently known (n=21 patients), suggesting that LepR deficiency is underdiagnosed. An important cause for this could be lack of access to genetic testing. Another possible explanation is insufficient recognition, as only one-third of patients has pituitary hormone deficiencies. With novel highly effective treatment emerging, diagnosing LepR deficiency is more important than ever.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654570>Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against lipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction via regulation of AMPK signaling and lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is known as a potent metabolic regulator but its protective mechanisms against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis remain elusive. Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet lipid metabolism in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic acid (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant insulin secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21. Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

The micro strains on the femur during single-leg stance of gait were measured on critical stress points based on the Gruen femoral zones.The micro strains increase as the weight increases implying that the displacement in the hip joint endoprosthesis is higher for overweight subjects enhancing the risk of failure. The highest increase was measured in Gruen zone 1 by 5.60% indicating that the great trochanter is subjected to higher stress shielding with increasing the weight. Also, the statistically significant increase of the micro strain values with increasing the weight in Gruen Zones 3 (2.91%), 5 (1.56%), and 11 (1.75%) may enhance the risk for a periprosthetic fracture at the lower region of the prosthesis.This is the first biomechanical study which quantifies the effect of increasing weight loading conditions on the mechanical environment of the hip joint endoprosthesis considering different positions of evaluation.Copyright © 2019.

While the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) is well recognized for its peripheral effects on reproductive behavior, release of OXT from somatodendrites and axonal terminals within the central nervous system (CNS) is also implicated in the control of control of energy balance. In this review we summarize historical data highlighting the effects of exogenous OXT as a short-term regulator of food intake in a context specific manner and the receptor populations that may mediate these effects. We also describe what is known about the physiological role of endogenous OXT in the control of energy balance and whether serum and brain levels of OXT relate to  on a consistent basis across animal models and humans with . We describe recent data on the effectiveness of chronic CNS administration of OXT to decrease food intake and weight gain or to elicit weight loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) and genetically obese mice and rats. Of clinical importance is the finding that both chronic central and peripheral OXT treatment evoke weight loss in obese animal models with impaired leptin signaling at doses that are not associated with visceral illness, tachyphylaxis, or adverse cardiovascular effects. Moreover, these results have been largely recapitulated following chronic subcutaneous or intranasal treatment in DIO nonhuman primates (rhesus monkeys) and obese humans, respectively. We also identify plausible mechanisms that contribute to the effects of OXT on body weight and glucose homeostasis in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans.

Erosion may be partial or complete with intragastric migration of the band. Once in the stomach lumen, the band has the potential to migrate into the small bowel.A 43-year-old male with history of morbid  and laparoscopic adjustable gastric band placement presented with abdominal pain secondary to biliary obstruction. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed eroded gastric band tubing into the lumen of the stomach and duodenum with resultant distortion of the ampulla. Upon surgical exploration, the band was found to have migrated into the jejunum and was removed through an enterotomy. The patient did well and was discharged home on postoperative day 8.Once completely eroded into the gastric lumen, a gastric band can migrate into the small bowel with the distance traveled being limited by the length of the connecting tube. The stretched tubing can result in distortion of the ampulla leading to biliary obstruction.

The adiponectin subsequently imparts a crucial role in metabolic and hepato-inflammatory diseases. The most recent evidences indicate that lipotoxicity-induced inflammation in the liver is associated with -derived alterations and remolding in adipose tissue that culminates in most prevalent liver pathology named as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A comprehensive crosstalk of adiponectin and its cognate receptors, specifically adiponectin receptor-2 in the liver mediates ameliorative effects in -induced NAFLD by interaction with hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Recent studies highlight the implication of molecular mediators mainly involved in the pathogenesis of  and -driven NAFLD, however, the plausible mechanisms remain elusive. The present review aimed at collating the data regarding mechanistic approaches of adiponectin and adiponectin-activated PPARs as well as PPAR-induced adiponectin levels in attenuation of hepatic lipoinflammation. Understanding the rapidly occurring adiponectin-mediated pathophysiological outcomes might be of importance in the development of new therapies that can potentially resolve  and -associated NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657456>Predictors of postoperative overall and severe complications after surgical treatment for endometrial cancer: The role of the fragility index.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the predictive value of , comorbidities, and fragility on overall and severe complication rate and survival among patients surgically treated for endometrial cancer.Consecutive patients with endometrial cancer treated at the Royal Infirmary Hospital of Edinburgh from June 1, 2015, to June 30, 2017, were retrospectively enrolled in an observational study. Considering pre-existing medical conditions, comorbidities, and complications, modified fragility index (mFI) was calculated. Logistic regression was used to evaluate predicting variables of overall (G1-G4) and severe (G3-G4) complication rate.One hundred patients were surgically treated for endometrial cancer. Elevated mFI >3 was related to a statistically higher access rate to the high dependency unit (HDU) or intensive care unit (ITU) (33.3% vs 6.6%, P=0.013). Overall, 31% of women had postoperative complications. Using multivariate analysis, it was shown that undergoing laparotomy (odds ratio [OR] 7.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.52-19.71; P<0.001) and having an mFI >3 (OR 7.19, 95% CI 1.43-36.25; P=0.021) were independent predictors of overall complications (G1-G4). Moreover, only smoking (OR 5.01, 95% CI 1.15-21.75; P=0.031) and mFI >3 (OR 5.16, 95% CI 1.07-24.94; P=0.047) were independent factors for severe complications (G3-G4).Modified fragility index was an important predictor of complications among patients treated for endometrial cancer and could be a useful tool for assisting clinicians in perioperative management.© 2019 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665382>Time to diagnosis in Cushing's syndrome: A meta-analysis based on 5367 patients.</a></h2><p>Signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome (CS) overlap with common diseases, such as the metabolic syndrome, , osteoporosis, and depression.

How long-term dietary BCAAs impact late-life health and lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that when dietary BCAAs are varied against a fixed, isocaloric macronutrient background, long-term exposure to high BCAA diets leads to hyperphagia,  and reduced lifespan. These effects are not due to elevated BCAA  or hepatic mTOR activation, but rather due to a shift in the relative quantity of dietary BCAAs and other AAs, notably tryptophan and threonine. Increasing the ratio of BCAAs to these AAs resulted in hyperphagia and is associated with central serotonin depletion. Preventing hyperphagia by calorie restriction or pair-feeding averts the health costs of a high BCAA diet. Our data highlight a role for amino acid quality in energy balance and show that health costs of chronic high BCAA intakes need not be due to intrinsic toxicity but, rather, a consequence of hyperphagia driven by AA imbalance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662837>Common risk factors for major noncommunicable disease, a systematic overview of reviews and commentary: the implied potential for targeted risk reduction.</a></h2><p>Noncommunicable disease now contributes to the World Health Organization top 10 causes of death in low-, middle- and high-income countries. Particular examples include stroke, coronary heart disease, dementia and certain cancers. Research linking clinical and lifestyle risk factors to increased risk of noncommunicable disease is now well established with examples of confirmed risk factors, including smoking, physical inactivity,  and hypertension. However, despite a need to target our resources to achieve risk reduction, relatively little work has examined the overlap between the risk factors for these main noncommunicable diseases. Our high-level review draws together the evidence in this area. Using a systematic overview of reviews, we demonstrate the likely commonality of established risk factors having an impact on multiple noncommunicable disease outcomes. For example, systematic reviews of the evidence on physical inactivity and poor diet found each to be associated with increased risk of cancers, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus and dementia. We highlight the potential for targeted risk reduction to simultaneously impact multiple noncommunicable disease areas.

Using 17,370 term labor inductions without documented medical indications occurring at 14 U.S. hospitals, 2007-2012, we created and evaluated a model predicting cesarean delivery. We assessed model calibration and discrimination, and we used bootstrapping for internal validation. We externally validated the model by using 2122 labor inductions from a hospital not included in the development cohort.  The model contained eight variables-gestational age, maternal race, parity, maternal age, , fibroids, excessive fetal growth, and history of herpes-and was well calibrated with good risk stratification at the extremes of predicted probability. The model had an area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.81-0.83), and it performed well on internal validation. The AUC in the external validation cohort was 0.82.

The majority of diabetes mellitus (DM) patients belong to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is highly associated with . The general principle of current therapeutic strategies for patients with T2DM mainly focuses on restoring cellular insulin response by potentiating the insulin-induced signaling pathway. In late-stage T2DM, impaired insulin production requires the patients to receive insulin replacement therapy for maintaining their glucose homeostasis. T2DM patients also demonstrate a drop of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in their circulation, which suggests that replenishing BDNF or enhancing its downstream signaling pathway may be beneficial. Because of their protein nature, recombinant insulin or BDNF possess several limitations that hinder their clinical application in T2DM treatment. Thus, developing orally active "insulin pill" or "BDNF pill" is essential to provide a more convenient and effective therapy. This article reviews the current development of non-peptidyl chemicals that mimic insulin or BDNF and their potential as anti-diabetic agents.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665209>Knowledge and debate in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition: new sections, new science, and looking forward and outward.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661008> ipopulation!nducing acute respiratory distress syndrome: we should choose the right</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657237>Midlife women's health consequences associated with polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common female endocrinopathies.

The major cell type in the adipose tissue, the adipocytes or fat cells, are remarkably plastic and can increase or decrease their size and number to adapt to changes in systemic or local metabolism. Changes in adipocyte size occur through hypertrophy or atrophy, and changes in cell numbers mainly involve de novo generation of new cells or death of existing cells. Recently, dedifferentiation, whereby a mature adipocyte is reverted to an undifferentiated progenitor-like status, has been reported as a mechanism underlying adipocyte plasticity. Dedifferentiation of mature adipocytes has been observed under both physiological and pathological conditions. This review covers several aspects of adipocyte dedifferentiation, its relevance to adipose tissue function, molecular pathways that drive dedifferentiation, and the potential of therapeutic targeting adipocyte dedifferentiation in human health and metabolic diseases.© 2019 The Author(s).

We measured the anesthetized Hoffmann's or H-reflex, the electrical analog of the muscle stretch reflex. Adult mice of both sexes were fed a control diet (CD; 10% kcal from fat) or a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal from fat) for 5, 10, or 15 weeks. We used three quantitative measures of H-reflex excitability: (1) H-reflex latency; (2) the percentage of motor neurons recruited from electrical stimulation of Group Ia muscle spindle afferents (H /M ); and (3) rate-dependent depression (RDD), the decrease in H-reflex amplitude to high frequency stimulation (20 stimuli at 5 Hz). A HFD did not significantly alter H latency (P = 0.16) or H /M ratios (P = 0.06), but RDD was significantly lower in HFD compared to CD groups (P < 0.001). Interestingly, HFD males exhibited decreased RDD compared to controls only after 5 and 10 weeks of feeding, but females showed progressive decreases in RDD that were only significant at 10 and 15 weeks on the HFD.

Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is frequently documented in chronic kidney disease, , diabetes and advanced age, all of which are risk factors for resistant hypertension. Sympathetic overactivity and chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system are salient features of resistant hypertension. Interestingly, recent data indicate that renal sympathetic overactivity can reduce the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the paraventricular nucleus. Reduced NO levels in the paraventricular nucleus can increase sympathetic outflow and this can create a vicious cycle contributing to resistant hypertension. Angiotensin II can reduce l-arginine transport and hence NO production. Reduced NO levels may reduce the formation of angiotensin 1-7 dampening the cardio-protective effects of the renin-angiotensin system contributing to resistant hypertension. In addition, interleukin-6 (IL-6) is demonstrated to be independently associated with resistant hypertension, and IL-6 can reduce NO synthesis. Despite this, NO levels have not been quantified in resistant hypertension. Findings from a small proof of concept study indicate that NO donors can reduce blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension but more studies are required to validate these preliminary findings. In the present paper, we put forward the hypothesis that reduced NO bioavailability contributes substantially to the development of resistant hypertension.© 2019 The Author(s).

Aspirin is used as a tool for both primary and secondary prevention, but recent studies suggest that its lack of efficacy for primary prevention is partly attributable to . Several mechanisms have been described that contribute to AR in obese patients using pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

The mechanisms by which maternal  can induce alterations in fetal and later neonatal metabolism are not fully elucidated due to its complexity and multifactorial causes. Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, are involved in fetal and postnatal growth trajectories, and both are altered in women with pregestational . The placenta synthesizes leptin, which goes mainly to the maternal circulation and in lesser amount to the developing fetus. Maternal pregestational  and hyperleptinemia are associated with placental dysfunction and changes in nutrient transporters which directly affect fetal growth and development. By the other side, the embryo can produce its own leptin from early in development, which is associated to fetal weight and adiposity. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is downregulated in maternal . High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin is the most abundant form and with most biological actions. In maternal  lower total and HMW adiponectin levels have been described in the mother, paralleled with high levels in the umbilical cord. Several studies have found that cord blood adiponectin levels are related with postnatal growth trajectories, and it has been suggested that low adiponectin levels in women with pregestational  enhance placental insulin sensitivity and activation of placental amino acid transport systems, supporting fetal overgrowth. The possible mechanisms by which maternal pregestational , focusing in the actions of leptin and adiponectin, affects the fetal development and postnatal growth trajectories in their offspring are discussed.Copyright © 2019.

This prospective study quantifies vancomycin pharmacokinetics in morbidly obese and non-obese individuals, in order to guide vancomycin dosing in the obese.Morbidly obese individuals (n=20) undergoing bariatric surgery and non-obese healthy volunteers (n=8) (total body weight (TBW) 60.0-234.6 kg) received a single vancomycin dose (obese: 12.5 mg kg , maximum 2500 mg; non-obese: 1000 mg) with plasma concentrations measured over 48 hours (11-13 samples per individual). Modelling, internal validation, external validation using previously published data and simulations (n=9950 individuals, TBW 60-230 kg) were performed using NONMEM.In a three-compartment model, peripheral volume and clearance increased with TBW (both p<0.001), which was confirmed in the external validation. A dose of 35 mg kg per day (maximum 5500 mg/day) resulted in a >90% target attainment (AUC>400 mg*h L ) in individuals up to 200 kg, with corresponding trough concentrations of 5.7-14.6 mg L (twice daily dosing). For continuous infusion, a loading dose of 1500 mg is required for steady state on day 1.In this prospective, rich sampling pharmacokinetic study, vancomycin clearance was well predicted using TBW. We recommend that in obese individuals without renal impairment, vancomycin should be dosed as 35 mg kg per day (maximized at 5500 mg/day). When given over two daily doses, trough concentrations between 5.7-14.6 mg L correspond to the target exposure in obese individuals.This article is protected by copyright.

Microbiota-derived metabolites act both as nutrients and as messenger molecules and can signal to distant organs in the body to shape host pathophysiology. In this review, we provide a new perspective on succinate as a gut microbiota-derived metabolite with a key role governing intestinal homeostasis and energy metabolism. Thus, succinate is not merely a major intermediary of the TCA traditionally considered as an extracellular danger signal in the host, but also a by-product of some bacteria and a primary cross-feeding metabolite between gut resident microbes. In addition to maintain a healthy microbiome, specific functions of microbiota-derived succinate in peripheral tissues regulating host nutrient metabolism should not be rule out. Indeed, recent research point to some probiotic interventions directed to modulate succinate levels in the intestinal lumen, as a new microbiota-based therapies to treat  and related co-morbidities. While further research is essential, a large body of evidence point to succinate as a new strategic mediator in the microbiota-host cross-talk, which might provide the basis for new therapeutically approaches in a near future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661341>Thinness, overweight, and  in indigenous school children and youth in Mexico.</a></h2><p> The prevalence of overweight (OWT) and  (OB), defined by the body mass index (BMI, kg/m) among children and youth has increased worldwide in the last 30-40 years. To evaluate the weight status, defined by the BMI, of indigenous school children and youth resident in different regions of Mexico Students 6-18 years (31,448 boys, 27,306 girls) were enrolled in bilingual schools for indigenous children and youth in Mexico in 2012. Height and weight were measured; the BMI was calculated. The BMI of each student was classified relative to International  Task Force (IOTF) age- and sex-specific criteria as thin (three grades), normal, overweight (OWT) or obese (OB). The sample was divided into five geographic regions for analysis: North, Central, South-Gulf, South-Pacific, and South-Southeast.

Night temperature is an important factor that influences the plug seedling quality. However, little research has focused on how the night temperature affects the growth and development of plug seedlings of these two medicinal species. In this study, uniform plug seedlings were cultivated in three environmentally controlled chambers for four weeks under three sets of day/night temperatures (25/10 °C, 25/15 °C, or 25/20 °C), the same relative humidity (75%), photoperiod (12 h), and light intensity (150 μmol·m·s PPFD) provided by white LEDs. The results showed that night temperature had a marked influence on the growth and development of both species. The night temperature of 15 °C notably enhanced the quality of plug seedlings evidenced by the increased shoot, root, and leaf dry weights, stem diameter, and Dickson's quality index. Moreover, a night temperature of 15 °C also stimulated and increased contents of primary and secondary metabolites, including soluble sugar, starch, total phenols and flavonoids. Furthermore, the 15 °C night temperature increased the chlorophyll content and stomatal conductance and decreased the hydrogen peroxide content.

There is a relationship between the high activity of this enzyme and the development of  and metabolic disorders. The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)-5-((benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats. The in vitro results showed that C1 was a better inhibitor of human 11β-HSD1 than CLX. The ex vivo assay results demonstrated that C1 was capable of reducing 11β-HSD1 overexpression in mesenteric adipose tissue. Therefore, C1 was able to decrease the activity and expression of 11β-HSD1 better than CLX.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661783>A Lipidomic Analysis of Docosahexaenoic Acid (22:6, ω3) Mediated Attenuation of Western Diet Induced Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Male  Mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health problem worldwide. NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC).  and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced NASH. We previously used a preclinical mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse,  model to assess transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in membrane lipids and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as well as C ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins. NASH markers of inflammation and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted -value;  ≤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial remission of WD-induced NASH, at least in part, by lowering hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C ω3 PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660674>In vivo imaging of hemodynamic redistribution and arteriogenesis across microvascular network.</a></h2><p>Arteriogenesis is an important mechanism that contributes to restoration of oxygen supply in chronically ischemic tissues, but remains incompletely understood due to technical limitations. This study presents a novel approach for comprehensive assessment of the remodeling pattern in a complex microvascular network containing multiple collateral microvessels.We have developed a hardware-software integrated platform for quantitative, longitudinal, and label-free imaging of network-wide hemodynamic changes and arteriogenesis at the single-vessel level. By ligating feeding arteries in the mouse ear, we induced network-wide hemodynamic redistribution and localized arteriogenesis. The utility of this technology's was demonstrated by studying the influence of  on microvascular arteriogenesis.Simultaneously monitoring the remodeling of competing collateral arterioles revealed a new, inverse relationship between initial vascular resistance and extent of arteriogenesis. Obese mice exhibited similar remodeling responses to lean mice through the first week, including diameter increase and flow upregulation in collateral arterioles. However, these gains were subsequently lost in obese mice.Capable of label-free, comprehensive, and dynamic quantification of structural and functional changes in the microvascular network in vivo, this platform opens up new opportunities to study the mechanisms of microvascular arteriogenesis, its implications in diseases, and approaches to pharmacologically rectify microvascular dysfunction.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657972>RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTORC1 and TP53 pathways and regulatory miRs as therapeutic targets in hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant problem globally because of viral infections and the increasing incidence of  and fatty liver disease.

The Bill established the requirement of a 100% pass-through of the tax to the final consumer and two levels of the tax: 0.08 euro/liter for products with 5-less than 8 g of sugar and 0.12 euro/liter for products with 8 g of sugar or more. Previous literature focusing on the impact of SSB taxes finds that pass-though is only complete in the long-term. Our paper provides new evidence that, when the tax increases prices substantially and immediately, the sales response is also significant. In particular, we estimate that the new SSB tax in Catalonia reduced SSB purchases by 7.7%. We document that part of this reduction is substituted by an increase in sales of zero/light drinks (substitution effect). Importantly, the reduction in purchases is stronger in areas with a higher incidence of , in areas with higher household incomes and for products with higher sugar content.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

SPRY2 is a candidate gene identified in GWAS of body fat percentage and T2DM, and has recently been linked to insulin production in pancreatic β-cells. In the present study, we aimed to further understand SPRY2 via functional characterisation in HepG2 cells, an in vitro model of human hepatocytes widely used to investigate T2DM and insulin resistance.CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to target SPRY2 in HepG2 cells, and the functional consequences of SPRY2 knockout (KO) and overexpression subsequently assessed using glucose uptake and lipid droplet assays, measurement of protein kinase phosphorylation and RNA sequencing.The major functional consequence of SPRY2 KO was a significant increase in glucose uptake, along with elevated lipid droplet accumulation. These changes were attenuated, but not reversed, in cells overexpressing SPRY2. Phosphorylation of protein kinases across key signalling pathways (including Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases) was not altered after SPRY2 KO. Transcriptome profiling in SPRY2 KO and mock (control) cells revealed a number of differentially expressed genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and cellular signalling pathways.

In contrast,  is one of the most strongly TZD-induced transcripts in human adipocytes, although not in cells from all individuals. Two putative PPARγ binding sites exist near the gene's transcription start site (TSS) in human but not mouse adipocytes. The -4 kb upstream site falls in a segmental duplication of a nearly identical intronic region +2.5 kb downstream of the TSS, and this duplication occurred in the primate lineage and not in other mammals, like mice. PPARγ binding and gene activation occur via this upstream duplicated site, thus explaining the species difference. Furthermore, this functional upstream PPARγ site exhibits genetic variation among people, with 1 SNP allele disrupting a PPAR response element and giving less activation by PPARγ and TZDs. In addition to this upstream variant that determines PPARγ regulation of  in adipocytes, distinct variants downstream of the TSS have strong effects on  expression in human fat as well as other tissues. A haplotype of 7 tightly linked downstream SNP alleles is associated with very low  expression and correspondingly high DNA methylation at the TSS.

At the vascular level, T presents genomic and non-genomic effects, and both effects may overlap. The genomic actions assume that androgens can freely cross the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to nuclear androgen receptors, inducing gene transcription and protein synthesis. The non-genomic effects have a more rapid onset and may be related to the interaction with protein/receptor/ion channels of the plasma membrane. The key T effect at the vascular level is vasorelaxation, which is primarily due to its rapid effect. Thus, the main purpose of this review is to discuss the T non-genomic effects at the vascular level and the molecular pathways involved in its vasodilator effect observed in in vivo and in vitro studies. In this sense, the nuclear receptor activation, the influence of vascular endothelium and the activation or inhibition of ion channels (potassium and calcium channels, respectively) will be reviewed regarding all the data that corroborated or not. Moreover, this review also provides a brief update on the association of T with the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, namely metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, , atherosclerosis, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension.

Initial areas of interest include nutrition and ; tobacco, marijuana, and other substance use; and cardiovascular risk factors.Twenty-three cohorts with data on almost 200 000 women have combined to form this consortium, begun in 2018. Twelve studies are of women or couples actively planning pregnancy, and six are general-population cohorts that cover the reproductive years; the remainder have some other design. The primary focus for four was cardiovascular health, eight was fertility, one was environmental exposures, three was child health, and the remainder general women's health. Among other cohorts assessed for inclusion, the most common reason for ineligibility was lack of prospectively collected preconception data.The consortium will serve as a resource for research in many subject areas related to preconception health, with implications for science, practice, and policy.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662704>Corrigendum to "CD36-Mediated Lipid Accumulation and Activation of NLRP3 Inflammasome Lead to Podocyte Injury in -Related Glomerulopathy".</a></h2><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1155/2019/3172647.].Copyright © 2019 Jing Zhao et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653901>Prognosis and Associated Factors among Elderly Patients with Small Artery Occlusion.</a></h2><p>Small artery occlusion (SAO) is the one of the primary subtype of ischemic stroke in China. However, its outcomes among elderly patients are unclear. Consecutive patients with SAO were recruited at Jiamusi University First Hospital, China between January 2008 and December 2016. Stroke subtype, severity, and risk factors were collected; outcomes at 3, 12, and 36 months after stroke onset were assessed. A total of 1464 SAO patients were included in this study. Participants aged ≥75 years had higher dependency rates than Participants aged <75 years with SAO in all three follow-up periods, in addition to a higher recurrence rate at 12 months and a higher mortality rate 36 months after stroke. After adjusting for confounders, elevated triglyceride level was found to be a protective factor against mortality 36 months after stroke. Stroke severity, diabetes mellitus, artery stenosis, gender, , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level were independently associated with the risk of dependency; elevated triglyceride level was an independent risk factor for recurrence at 3 months point after stroke onset. These findings suggest that it is vital to manage risk factors that may affect prognosis of stroke among elderly patients with SAO to improve patient prognosis and reduce the burden of stroke in China.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661025>Association between cognitive impairment patient with solid cancer and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>In an aging population, an increase in the number of elderly cancer patients with cognitive impairment is expected. The possible association between cancer and cognitive impairment is important to elucidate, because it can have a serious impact on quality of life. Here, we focused on glucose metabolism as a factor that links cancer and cognitive impairment.Thirteen subjects with solid cancers and cognitive impairment were recruited. As a control group, 14 subjects with cognitive impairment alone and 8 subjects with cancer alone were recruited. A Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and that of β-cell function (HOMA-B) were used. In comparison with patients with solid cancer alone, those with cognitive impairment alone and those with both cancer and cognitive impairment had increased HOMA-IR values. Insulin resistance was increased in patients with cognitive impairment alone and those with both cognitive impairment and solid cancer than in patients without cognitive impairment; however, β-cell function was not affected. The present data indicated that elderly cancer patients with high HOMA-IR score may be at a relatively high risk for developing cognitive impairment. Furthermore, early treatment to reduce insulin sensitivity may prevent cognitive impairment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660449>Dietary Exposure to Transgenic Rice Expressing the Spider Silk Protein Fibroin Reduces Blood Glucose Levels in Diabetic Mice: The Potential Role of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 Phosphorylation in Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by insulin resistance (IR). T2DM is correlated with  and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy metabolism and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and tyrosine 632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and tyrosine 632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655800>Second Trimester Maternal Leptin Levels Are Associated with Body Mass Index and Gestational Weight Gain but not Birth Weight of the Infant.</a></h2><p> is increasing among the pregnant population. Leptin has an important role in the regulation of energy balance and hunger. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between maternal leptin levels with maternal , gestational weight gain (GWG), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the leptin gene, and the age-adjusted birth weight of the child.Maternal leptin levels (n = 740) and SNPs (n = 504) were analyzed in blood samples taken within the Uppsala Biobank of Pregnant women at pregnancy weeks 16-19.Maternal leptin levels differed significantly between body mass index (BMI) groups. Normal weight women had the lowest median leptin levels and levels increased with each BMI group. Leptin SNP genotype was not associated with leptin levels or BMI. There was also no association between maternal leptin levels and age-adjusted birth weight of the child except for a negative association between leptin levels and birth weight in the morbid obese group.Maternal BMI was identified as the best positive explanatory factor for maternal leptin levels. Leptin was a strong positive explanatory factor for GWG. Birth weight of children of uncomplicated pregnancies was, however, dependent on maternal height, BMI, GWG, and parity but not leptin levels, except for in morbid obese women where a negative association between maternal leptin levels and birth weight was found. We speculate that this indicates altered placental function, not manifested in pregnancy complication. We conclude that maternal leptin levels do not affect the birth weight of the child more than BMI, GWG, and parity.© 2019 S.

The current study aims to assess the effect of interpregnancy weight change on the risk of developing gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension, preterm birth, or delivering a large- or small-for-gestational age neonate.Pubmed, Ovid Embase, ClinicalTrial.gov and the Cochrane library were systematically searched up until July 24th, 2019. Interpregnancy weight change was defined as the difference between pre-pregnancy weight of an index pregnancy and a consecutive pregnancy. Inclusion criteria included full text original articles reporting quantitative data about interpregnancy weight change in multiparous women with any time interval between consecutive births and the risk of any perinatal complication of interest. Studies reporting adjusted odds ratios and a reference group of - 1 to + 1 BMI unit change between pregnancies were harmonised by meta-analysis.Twenty-three cohort studies identified a total of 671,906 women with two or more consecutive pregnancies. Seven of these studies were included in the meta-analysis (280,672 women). Interpregnancy weight gain was consistently associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension and large-for-gestational age births. In contrast, interpregnancy weight loss was associated with a lower risk of delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate. The effect magnitude (relative risk) of interpregnancy weight gain on pregnancy induced hypertension or delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate was greater among women with a normal BMI in the index pregnancy compared to women with a starting BMI ≥25 kg/m.These findings confirm that interpregnancy weight change impacts the risk of developing perinatal complications in a subsequent pregnancy. This provides evidence in support of guidelines encouraging women to achieve post-partum weight loss, as their risk of perinatal complications might be minimised if they return to their pre-pregnancy weight before conceiving again.

To support further investigations of BMI and cognition, this study aimed to create a concise test battery to be used in future trials.Twenty neurocognitive measures were regressed on BMI in the Human Connectome Project Healthy Young Adult S1200 data release by using linear mixed models and by adjusting for major confounders. Measures were then identified by using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis to select tests most strongly associated with BMI. To guide further test selection, the explained variance for each variable was visualized in the final model.BMI was negatively associated with seven neurocognitive measures. Variable selection yielded a model that included years of education and, in order of model weight, delay discounting, the relational task, the Penn Progressive Matrices test, the oral reading recognition test, the Variable Short Penn Line Orientation test, and the Penn Word Memory test.This research resulted in an approximate 40-minute test battery for the BMI-cognition relationship in young adults that can be used in trials investigating the interrelationship between  and cognitive performance.© 2019 The  Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646115>Metabolically healthy versus unhealthy  and risk for diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases.</a></h2><p> presents one of the biggest issues of modern-day life for a wide variety of medical specialties, starting with the cardiologist and ending with the diabetologist or the bariatric surgeon. However, in the last few years a new entity has emerged, the metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individual. This category encompasses obese individuals without the presence of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, or hypertension. Several studies have thus been undertaken to determine the risk of these MHO individuals for diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular diseases compared with the 'unhealthy' obese. Data are still controversial on this matter, but one trend seems to be emerging: MHO is but a transient phase in the path toward insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Patients were categorized as overweight or class I, II, III obese based on established body mass index (BMI) cut-offs. Liver disease severity was determined using biochemical, imaging (magnetic resonance elastography [MRE]), and histologic evidence of liver injury.Three cohorts were studied individually based on the method used to assess disease severity (biochemical n = 767, imaging n = 366, and histology n = 249). Between the three cohorts, there were significant differences in age, proportion of patients with class II and class III , and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels. In the biochemistry cohort, the odds of having ALT > 80 U/L were highest in patients with class III  (P = .026). In the imaging cohort, liver stiffness was significantly different between BMI groups of patients (P = .001). In the histology cohort, those with class III  had significantly higher odds of NAFLD activity score (NAS) ≥ 5 (P = .012). severity is associated with liver disease severity.

We conducted meta-analyses and subgroup analyses to determine the overall effects of  prevention programs and effect differences by various characteristics of intervention components on body mass index (BMI) or BMI Z-score of children.This systematic review included a total of 50 trials (reported by 56 publications). Significant differences were found between groups on BMI (- 0.14 kg/m (95% confidence interval: - 0.21, - 0.06)) and BMI Z-score (- 0.05 (- 0.10, - 0.01)) for single-component interventions; significant differences were also found between groups on BMI (- 0.32 (- 0.54, - 0.09) kg/m) and BMI Z-score (- 0.07 (- 0.14, - 0.001)) for multi-component interventions. Subgroup analyses consistently demonstrated that effects of single-component (physical activity) interventions including curricular sessions (- 0.30 (- 0.51, - 0.10) kg/m in BMI) were stronger than those without curricular sessions (- 0.04 (- 0.17, 0.09) kg/m in BMI); effects of single-component (physical activity) interventions were also strengthened if physical activity sessions emphasized participants' enjoyment (- 0.19 (- 0.33, - 0.05) kg/m in BMI for those emphasizing participants' enjoyment; - 0.004 (- 0.10, 0.09) kg/m in BMI for those not emphasizing participants' enjoyment). The current body of evidence did not find specific characteristics of intervention components that were consistently associated with improved efficacy for multi-component interventions (P > 0.05).School-based interventions are generally effective in reducing excessive weight gain of children. Our findings contribute to increased understandings of potentially effective intervention characteristics for single-component (physical activity) interventions.

Although excess leptin levels have been associated with vascular inflammation and cardiovascular disease in the context of , the effects of chronic leptin treatment on vascular function remain unknown in CGL. Here, we hypothesized that leptin treatment will improve endothelial function via direct vascular mechanisms. We investigated the cardiovascular consequences of leptin deficiency and supplementation in male gBscl2 ( gene-deficient) mice-a mouse model of CGL. CGL mice exhibited reduced adipose mass and leptin levels, as well as impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation. Blood vessels from CGL mice had increased NADPH Oxidase 1 (Nox1) expression and reactive oxygen species production, and selective Nox1 inhibition restored endothelial function. Remarkably, chronic and acute leptin supplementation restored endothelial function via a PPARγ-dependent mechanism that decreased Nox1 expression and reactive oxygen species production. Selective ablation of leptin receptors in endothelial cells promoted endothelial dysfunction, which was restored by Nox1 inhibition. Lastly, we confirmed in aortic tissue from older patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery that acute leptin can promote signaling in human blood vessels. In conclusion, in gBscl2 mice, leptin restores endothelial function via peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma-dependent decreases in Nox1. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that vessels from aged patients remain leptin sensitive. These data reveal a new direct role of leptin receptors in the control of vascular homeostasis and present leptin as a potential therapy for the treatment of vascular disease associated with low leptin levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658534>[Food environment and its relation to diet behavior and  in China].</a></h2><p> In this study, a systematic review was made on scientific evidence regarding the impact of food environment on diet-related behavior and  in China.

The stage of each tooth was converted into a score using the table suggested by Demirjian, and the sum of these scores was designated as the 'maturity score'. : This study found statistically significant differences in dental maturity between the weight groups (analysis of variance, P=0.003), with the maturity score being higher in the obese group than in normal-weight subjects (Tukey's post-hoc test, P=0.004). The linear regression showed a positive association between BMI and the maturity score after adjusting for sex and age (β=0.34, P<0.001). The linear regression coefficient was higher in girls (β=0.61, P<0.001) than in boys (β=0.31, P=0.02). : These data suggest that dental maturation is positively associated with BMI in Korean children. Since many treatment decisions are made in relation to dental maturity, these findings may have implications for pediatric dental care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646124>Effect of vitamin D status on lipid profile in premenopausal women: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>High lipid levels play important roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and some authors suggest vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D status on lipid profile in premenopausal women.A total of 315 nonsmoking premenopausal female volunteers without diabetes mellitus were included in the study. Patients were divided into four subgroups. The groups were as follows: patients with less than or equal to 12 ng/ml (group 1, =126) vitamin D levels, between 20 and 12 ng/ml (group 2, =48), between 30 and 20 ng/ml (group 3, =21), and at least 30 ng/ml (group 4, =120) vitamin D levels. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and non-HDL-C levels of the four groups were compared.HDL-C levels of group 4 were the highest (=0.03), and TG and non-HDL-C levels of group 1 were the highest (=0.04, 0.016, respectively) in all groups. There was no significant difference between serum parathormone, calcium, and phosphorus levels of the four groups (=0.778, 0.121, 0.184, respectively). In unadjusted analysis, 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were found to be correlated negatively with BMI (=0.0005), LDL-C (=0.01), and non-HDL-C (=0.003) and correlated positively with HDL-C levels (=0.006). After adjustments for age, sex, BMI, and log parathormone levels were made, no correlation was found between 25-hydroxy vitamin D and lipid (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG) levels (=0.91, 0.06, 0.95, 0.79, respectively).There may be an association between vitamin D insufficiency and dyslipidemia.

The establishment of these epigenetic changes may precede cardiovascular (CV) complications and help us to predict vascular lesions in diabetic patients. Importantly, these epigenetic marks may be transmitted across several generations (transgenerational effect) and increase the individual risk of disease. Aberrant DNA methylation and imbalance of histone modifications, mainly acetylation and methylation of H3, represent key determinants of vascular lesions and, thus, putative useful biomarkers for prevention and diagnosis of CV risk in diabetics. Moreover, a differential expression of some micro-RNAs (miRNAs), mainly miR-126, may be a useful prognostic biomarker for atherosclerosis development in asymptomatic subjects. Recently, also environmental-induced chemical perturbations in mRNA (epitranscriptome), mainly the N6-methyladenosine, have been associated with  and diabetes. Importantly, reversal of epigenetic changes by modulation of lifestyle and use of metformin, statins, fenofibrate and apabetalone may offer useful therapeutic options to prevent or delay CV events in diabetics increasing the opportunity for personalized therapy. Network medicine is a promising molecular-bioinformatic approach to identify the signaling pathways underlying the pathogenesis of CV lesions in diabetic patients. Moreover, machine learning tools combined with tomography are advancing the individualized assessment of CV risk in these patients. We remark the need of combining epigenetics and advanced bioinformatic platforms to improve the prediction of vascular lesions in diabetics increasing the opportunity for CV precision medicine.© The Author(s) 2019.

Data analysis was done using the statistical package for social sciences version 21. Association between variables was determined using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 247 open prostatectomy surgeries were reviewed, with the patients' ages ranging from 43 - 91 years and a mean age of 67.0 ± 8.8 years. Elective procedures were 98.8% while the remaining 1.2% were emergency cases. There were 24 (9.8%) surgical site infections. The duration of admission of the patients with SSI ranged from 6 - 15 days with a mean of 9.5 ± 3.2 days, as against 4 - 9 days (mean of 5.0 ± 2.1days) for those without SSI. All the patients with SSI were successfully managed with no resultant mortality. Risk factors identified for SSI were emergency surgery (p=0.001),  (p<0.0001), diabetes mellitus (p=0.008), smoking (p<0.0001), pre-operative catheterization (p<0.0001), excessive haemorrhage (p<0.0001) and post-operative suprapubic bladder drainage (p<0.0001).SSI is a recognized complication of open prostatectomy. Identified risk factors for its occurrence from this audit are emergency operation, , diabetes mellitus, smoking, pre-operative catheterization, excessive haemorrhage and post-operative suprapubic bladder drainage. Age, approach to prostatectomy (retropubic vs transvesical), incision type (lower midline vs pfannenstiel), level of the surgeon, catheter type and modality of irrigation were however not significant risk factors for post-prostatectomy SSI in this study.© 2019 Salako et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646132>Androgenic alopecia, premature graying, and hair thinning as independent predictors of coronary artery disease in young Asian males.</a></h2><p>We herewith aimed to explore the association of premature graying, androgenic alopecia (AGA), and hair thinning with coronary artery disease (CAD) in young (≤40 years) male individuals from Western India.In this prospective, case-control study, 1380 male individuals from a super speciality cardiac care center were enrolled, of which 468 were established cases of CAD and 912 were age-matched healthy male individuals not having history of any major illness including CAD. Details of demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and cutaneous markers were collected for both the groups.Prevalence of hypertension (30.3 vs. 13.6%),  (28.8 vs. 12.2%), hair thinning (36.3 vs. 14.6%), premature graying (49.6 vs. 29.9%), AGA (49.1 vs. 27.4%), and lipid abnormalities (total cholesterol - 16.7 vs. 8.8%; low-density lipoprotein - 7.3 vs. 2.2%; and high-density lipoprotein - 92.5 vs. 88.7%) were higher in cases as compared with control. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that AGA [5.619, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.025-7.845, <0.0001] is the strongest predictor of CAD among young Asian male individuals, closely followed by premature graying (5.267, 95% CI: 3.716-7.466, <0.0001),  (4.133, 95% CI: 2.839-6.018, <0.0001), and hair thinning (3.36, 95% CI: 2.452-4.621, <0.0001). SYNTAX score, left ventricle ejection fraction, and degree of disease severity were also found to be independent associates of premature graying and AGA.Our findings support the hypothesis that cutaneous markers are independently associated with underlying CAD irrespective of other classical cardiovascular risk factors. This, in combination with classical markers, could be effectively used for early identification and risk stratification of young patients with occult or established CAD.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the long-term effects of SG on T2DM remission with remission seen after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or gastric banding (GB).A literature search was performed in PubMed and Cochrane Library using the following search terms: 'sleeve gastrectomy', 'diabetes', 'gastric bypass' and 'gastric banding'. Studies published between January 2000 and April 2018, and with following inclusion criteria were selected for this review: BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2, age ≥ 18 years, follow-up ≥ 1 year, T2DM. Data was statistically analysed using a random-effects model and results were expressed as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval.After exclusion, 35 out of an initial 748 studies, consisting of 18 138 T2DM patients, remained for inclusion. Of these patients, 2480 underwent a SG. The remaining patients underwent a RYGB (n = 10,597) or GB (n = 5061). One year postoperatively, SG patients reached significantly (OR 0.71, p = 0.003) less T2DM remission than RYGB. After stratifying for different criteria for remission, RYGB still tended to result in higher remission rates, but the difference was not statistically significant. Beyond 1 year of follow-up, the difference between RYGB and SG in terms of T2DM remission decreased. SG was superior to the GB (OR 2.17, p = 0.001) after 1 year of follow-up.This review demonstrates important remission of T2DM following SG. Nevertheless, as remission was significantly more often observed following RYGB surgery, the latter procedure remains the gold standard for reaching T2DM remission in patients with concurrent .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655012>Hypocretin/orexin modulates body weight and the metabolism of glucose and insulin.</a></h2><p>The hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt/orexin) unit affects the functions of several organ systems including the nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and the reproductive systems.

Factors that either stimulate or inhibit the expression of hcrt/orexin system were also addressed in addition to its link to , and insulin and glucose metabolism. Hcrt/orexin ligands and receptors have been localized to different parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hcrt/orexin, orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors are also present in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) and in the exocrine (pancreas, salivary, lacrimal) as well as endocrine (pancreatic islets, pituitary, adrenal) glands. Several factors including stress, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, glutamate, nicotine, glucose, hypoglycemia stimulate the expression of Hcrt/orexin system, but it is inhibited by ageing, bone morphogenetic protein, hypoxia/hypercapnia, melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 and glucagon. Literature reports show that hcrt/orexin can significantly increase insulin secretion from normal and diabetic rat pancreata. Moreover, several studies reported that the tissue expression of glucose transporter type 4 is markedly higher after treatment with orexin. Hcrt/orexin also decreases blood glucose concentration and reduces insulin resistance. It reduces  by increasing browning of fat cells and energy expenditure. Taken together, hcrt/orexin modulates  and the metabolism of glucose and insulin.

Evidence has shown considerable interpersonal variation of changes in BP among people experiencing weight loss, and such variation might be partly determined by genetic factors. We assessed the changes in systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) among 692 participants randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets varying in macronutrient content for 2 years. Two separate polygenic scores (SBP/DBP-PGS derived from 52/50 single nucleotide polymorphisms) were built for each participant based on 66 BP-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. During a 2-year intervention, participants in the bottom versus upper tertile of SBP/DBP-PGS had a greater decrease in SBP (△SBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.84 versus -1.61, -4.76 versus -2.75, -2.49 versus -1.63; =0.001) or in DBP (△DBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.09 versus -1.34, -2.69 versus -1.44, -1.82 versus -0.53; <0.001). We also found gene-diet interaction on changes in SBP from baseline to 24 months (=0.009). Among participants assigned to a high-protein diet, those with a lower SBP-polygenic scores had greater decreases in SBP at months 6 (=0.018), months 12 (=0.007), and months 24 (=0.089); while no significant difference was observed across the SBP-polygenic scores tertile groups among those assigned to an average-protein diet (all  values >0.05).

Studies suggest that similar fat accumulation in a given population might result in different levels of dyslipidemia risk among individuals; for example, despite similar or leaner body composition compared with Caucasians, Asians of Korean descent experience a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia. These variations imply a possible role of gene- interactions on lipid profiles. Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 500 loci regulating plasma lipids, but the interaction structure between genes and  traits remains unclear. We hypothesized that some loci modify the effects of  on dyslipidemia risk and analyzed extensive gene-environment interactions (GxEs) at genome-wide levels to search for replicated gene- interactive single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In four Korean cohorts (n=18,025), we identified and replicated 20 gene- interactions, including novel variants ( and ) and known lipid-associated variants (, , , and ). When we estimated the additional heritability of dyslipidemia by considering GxEs, the gain was substantial for triglycerides (TGs) but mild for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (Total-C); the interaction explained up to 18.7% of TG, 2.4% of LDL-C, and 1.9% of Total-C heritability associated with waist-hip ratio. Our findings suggest that some individuals are prone to develop abnormal lipid profiles, particularly with regard to TGs, even with slight increases in  indices; ethnic diversities in the risk alleles might partly explain the differential dyslipidemia risk between populations.

However, leucine-related effects in tumour tissues are still poorly understood. Thus, we described the effects of leucine in both in vivo and in vitro models of a Walker-256 tumour. Tumour-bearing Wistar rats were randomly distributed into a control group (W; normoprotein diet) and leucine group (LW; leucine-rich diet [normoprotein + 3% leucine]). After 20 days of tumour evolution, the animals underwent -fludeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (F-FDG PET-CT) imaging, and after euthanasia, fresh tumour biopsy samples were taken for oxygen consumption rate measurements (Oroboros Oxygraph), electron microscopy analysis and RNA and protein extraction. Our main results from the LW group showed no tumour size change, lower tumour glucose (F-FDG) uptake, and reduced metastatic sites. Furthermore, leucine stimulated a shift in tumour metabolism from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, higher mRNA and protein expression of oxidative phosphorylation components, and enhanced mitochondrial density/area even though the leucine-treated tumour had a higher number of apoptotic nuclei with increased oxidative stress. In summary, a leucine-rich diet directed Walker-256 tumour metabolism to a less glycolytic phenotype profile in which these metabolic alterations were associated with a decrease in tumour aggressiveness and reduction in the number of metastatic sites in rats fed a diet supplemented with this branched-chain amino acid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663614>Association between Health Insurance and Health among Adults with Diabetes: Evidence from Medicare.</a></h2><p>Gaining Medicare eligibility at age 65 is associated with increased health insurance coverage and reduced medical expenditure risk, but few studies have examined changes in health outcomes among adults with a specific chronic condition.

Of those, 2498 veterans who underwent bariatric surgery were allocated to the surgery cohort. Sequential stratification was used to match each patient in the surgery cohort with up to 3 patients who had not undergone bariatric surgery but were of the same sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes status, and VA regional network and were closest in age, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and comorbidities. A total of 7456 patients were identified and allocated to the nonsurgery (control) cohort. The VA health care expenditures among the surgery and nonsurgery cohorts were estimated using regression models. Data were analyzed from July to August 2018 and in April 2019.The bariatric surgical procedures (n = 2498) included in this study were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (1842 [73.7%]), sleeve gastrectomy (381 [15.3%]), adjustable gastric banding (249 [10.0%]), and other procedures (26 [1.0%]).The study measured total, outpatient, inpatient, and outpatient pharmacy expenditures from 3 years before surgery to 10 years after surgery, excluding expenditures associated with the initial bariatric surgical procedure.Among 9954 veterans with severe , 7387 (74.2%) were men; the mean (SD) age was 52.3 (8.8) years for the surgery cohort and 52.5 (8.7) years for the nonsurgery cohort. Mean total expenditures for the surgery cohort were $5093 (95% CI, $4811-$5391) at 7 to 12 months before surgery, which increased to $7448 (95% CI, $6989-$7936) at 6 months after surgery. Postsurgical expenditures decreased to $6692 (95% CI, $6197-$7226) at 5 years after surgery, followed by a gradual increase to $8495 (95% CI, $7609-$9484) at 10 years after surgery. Total expenditures were higher in the surgery cohort than in the nonsurgery cohort during the 3 years before surgery and in the first 2 years after surgery. The expenditures of the 2 cohorts converged 5 to 10 years after surgery. Outpatient pharmacy expenditures were significantly lower among the surgery cohort in all years of follow-up ($509 lower at 3 years before surgery and $461 lower at 7 to 12 months before surgery), but these cost reductions were offset by higher inpatient and outpatient (nonpharmacy) expenditures.In this cohort study of 9954 predominantly older male veterans with severe , total health care expenditures increased immediately after patients underwent bariatric surgery but converged with those of patients who had not undergone surgery at 10 years after surgery. This finding suggests that the value of bariatric surgery lies primarily in its associations with improvements in health and not in its potential to decrease health care costs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654282>Multimodal non-invasive monitoring to apply an open lung approach strategy in morbidly obese patients during bariatric surgery.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the use of non-invasive variables for monitoring an open-lung approach (OLA) strategy in bariatric surgery. Twelve morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery received a baseline protective ventilation with 8 cmHO of positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP). Then, the OLA strategy was applied consisting in lung recruitment followed by a decremental PEEP trial, from 20 to 8 cmHO, in steps of 2 cmHO to find the lung's closing pressure. Baseline ventilation was then resumed setting open lung PEEP (OL-PEEP) at 2 cmHO above this pressure. The multimodal non-invasive variables used for monitoring OLA consisted in pulse oximetry (SpO), respiratory compliance (Crs), end-expiratory lung volume measured by a capnodynamic method (EELV), and esophageal manometry. OL-PEEP was detected at 15.9 ± 1.7 cmHO corresponding to a positive end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (P) of 0.9 ± 1.1 cmHO. ROC analysis showed that SpO was more accurate (AUC 0.92, IC95% 0.87-0.97) than Crs (AUC 0.76, IC95% 0.87-0.97) and EELV (AUC 0.73, IC95% 0.64-0.82) to detect the lung's closing pressure according to the change of P from positive to negative values. Compared to baseline ventilation with 8 cmHO of PEEP, OLA increased EELV (1309 ± 517 vs. 2177 ± 679 mL) and decreased driving pressure (18.3 ± 2.2 vs. 10.1 ± 1.7 cmHO), estimated shunt (17.7 ± 3.4 vs. 4.2 ± 1.4%), lung strain (0.39 ± 0.07 vs. 0.22 ± 0.06) and lung elastance (28.4 ± 5.8 vs. 15.3 ± 4.3 cmHO/L), respectively; all p < 0.0001.

Faecal butyric acid was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric acid has antiobesogenic effects, reduces insulin resistance, and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the weight-reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose weight is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric acid.Copyright © 2019 Per G.

Our aim was to evaluate implant reconstruction outcomes in the obese female in the presence of coincident surgical risk factors and identify potential risk-reducing interventions. A review of consecutive obese women (BMI ≥ 30) who underwent mastectomy and implant breast reconstruction was performed. Patient demographics, comorbidities, oncologic treatments, and reconstructive procedures and their complications were recorded. A total of 151 women (242 breast reconstructions) were included with mean follow-up of 28 months. Average BMI was 36. Eighty percent of cases were immediate and 20% delayed. ADMs were utilized in 58% of cases. About 25% of patients had diabetes with one-third achieving perioperative glycemic control. About 18% of women were active smokers, and 33% had radiotherapy. Major and minor complications occurred in 42% and 11% of patients, respectively. About 24% of reconstructed breasts required implant removal. Obese patients with prior radiation were three times as likely to develop infection (P = 0.008) and 2.5× as likely to undergo explantation (P = 0.002). Skin flap necrosis was three times as likely in obese smokers (P = 0.01). Increased rates of wound breakdown were identified in obese patients with increasing age (P = 0.005), smoking (P = 0.0035), and radiation (P = 0.023). In the obese radiated and smoking patient subgroups, surgical modifications (use of autologous tissue, delayed breast reconstruction timing, and no ADM) were associated with reduction in the relative risk for implant complications. While  alone increases implant breast reconstruction complication rates, the presence of additional risk factors compounds these rates. The use of surgical modifications may reduce the occurrence of perioperative complications in the obese female with coincident surgical risk factors undergoing implant breast reconstruction.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654447>Perceived social support mediates the association between attachment and cardiovascular reactivity in young adults.</a></h2><p>To understand the influence of social relationships on cardiovascular responses to stress, the present study investigated perceived affectionate support as a mediating variable explaining the association between specific attachment bonds (i.e., mother, father, partner, best friend) and cardiovascular reactivity (CVR). Utilizing a standardized stress testing protocol, 138 young adults completed measures of attachment and social support, with continuous cardiovascular measurements obtained using the Finometer Pro hemodynamic monitor. Results showed that the association between anxious and avoidant attachment and reactivity were mediated by perceived affectionate support; insecure attachment was linked to lower levels of perceived social support, which in turn was associated with lower CVR. For anxious attachment, this was noted only for mothers (SBP: B = -0.94, 95% CI [-1.94, -0.20]; DBP: B = -0.57, [-1.27, -0.10]), fathers (SBP: B = -0.72, [-1.42, -0.17]; DBP: B = -0.48, [-1.01, -0.13]), and best friends (SBP: B = -0.64, [-1.23, -0.18]; DBP: B = -0.40, [-0.81, -0.12]). For avoidant attachment, it was evident only for fathers (SBP: B = -0.70, [-1.33, -0.17]; DBP: B = -0.48, [-0.92, -0.15]) and partners (SBP: B = -0.78, [-1.64, -0.09]; DBP: B = -0.53, [-1.10, -0.11]). These findings suggest that insecure attachment is associated with lower levels of reactivity, which have been linked to negative health outcomes such as poor self-reported health, depression, and . Overall, this research expands on the support and relationship science literature by incorporating under-researched aspects of social relationships (i.e., specific attachment styles) and focusing on the mechanisms by which they are associated with physiological stress responses.© 2019 Society for Psychophysiological Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659611>College Climate and Sexual Orientation Differences in Weight Status.</a></h2><p>Previous research has identified significant sexual orientation disparities in .

Individual-level, serial cross-sectional data from the 2009-2013 College Student Health Survey, which includes 2- and 4-year college students (n = 29,118) attending 46 Minnesota colleges, were used. College-level data on LGB context were primarily collected through college websites. Multinomial logistic regression models were fit to examine associations between LGB college climate scores (including non-discrimination policies, presence of LGB or diversity-related student groups, LGB courses offered, LGB housing accommodations, and prevalence of LGB students) and students' weight status (underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and obese), based on self-reported height and weight. Higher LGB climate scores (i.e., more supportive environments) were associated with lower risk of overweight and  among all students. Sexual orientation-stratified findings among female students suggested that the association between LGB climate scores and weight status was similar to the overall female sample. Sexual orientation-stratified findings among male students showed a more complex relationship between LGB climate scores and weight status.

We sought to examine the associations between prenatal dog or cat keeping with caregiver-reported ADHD in preadolescents in the Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy and Asthma Longitudinal Study (WHEALS) birth cohort (N = 1258).At an interview with the caregiver at child age 10-12 years, caregivers reported if the WHEALS child had ever been diagnosed with ADHD. Similarly, during an interview with the mother prenatally, pet keeping (defined as dog or cat kept inside ≥1 h/day) was ascertained. Logistic regression models were fit to examine the association of prenatal pet keeping (dog keeping and cat keeping, separately) with ADHD.A subset of 627 children were included in the analyses: 93 who had ADHD and 534 with neurotypical development. After accounting for confounders and loss to follow-up, maternal prenatal dog exposure was associated with 2.23 times (95% CI: 1.15, 4.31; p = 0.017) greater odds of ADHD among boys. Prenatal dog keeping was not statistically significantly associated with ADHD in girls (odds ratio = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.06, 1.12; p = 0.070). Prenatal cat keeping was not associated with ADHD.In boys, but not girls, maternal prenatal dog keeping was positively associated with ADHD.

We evaluated the effectiveness of different doses of iron supplementation adjusted for the initial levels of hemoglobin (Hb) on maternal iron status and described some associated prenatal determinants. The ECLIPSES study included 791 women, randomized into two groups: Stratum 1 (Hb = 110-130g/L, received 40 or 80mg iron daily) and Stratum 2 (Hb > 130g/L, received 20 or 40mg iron daily). Clinical, biochemical, and genetic information was collected during pregnancy, as were lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics. In Stratum 1, using 80 mg/d instead of 40 mg/d protected against ID on week 36. Only women with ID on week 12 benefited from the protection against anemia and IDA by increasing Hb levels. In Stratum 2, using 20 mg/d instead of 40 mg/d reduced the risk of hemoconcentration in women with initial serum ferritin (SF) ≥ 15 μg/L, while 40 mg/d improved SF levels on week 36 in women with ID in early pregnancy. Mutations in the  gene increased the risk of hemoconcentration. Iron supplementation should be adjusted to early pregnancy levels of Hb and iron stores.

However, disproportionally changing body mass index (BMI) distributions pose particular challenges. Flexible modeling of the shape of BMI distributions may improve prediction performance.We used data from repeated national health surveys conducted in Mexico, Colombia and Peru at four or five time points between 1988 and 2014. Data from all surveys except the last survey were used to construct prediction models for three  indicators (median BMI, overweight/ prevalence and  prevalence) for the time of the last survey. We assessed their performance using predicted curves, absolute prediction errors and comparison of actual and predicted distributions. With one method, we modeled the shape of BMI distributions assuming BMI follows a Box-Cox Power Exponential (BCPE) distribution, whose parameters were modeled as a function of interval or nominal 5-year age groups, time and their interaction terms. In a second method, we modeled each of the  indicators directly as a function of the same covariates using quantile and logistic regression.The BCPE model with interval age groups yielded the best prediction performance in predicting  prevalence. Average absolute prediction errors across all age groups were 4.3 percentage points (95% percentile interval: 1.9, 7.5), 2.5 (1.2, 6.1) and 1.7 (1.0, 9.3), with data from Mexico, Colombia and Peru, respectively. This superiority was weak or none for overweight/ prevalence and median BMI.The BCPE model performed better for prediction of the extremes of BMI distribution, possibly by incorporating its shape more precisely.© The Author(s) 2019; all rights reserved.

Early screening and prevention of  is critical for averting associated morbidity, disability, and mortality. Ethiopia has been using the international (WHO's) BMI cut-off for diagnosing  even though its validity among Ethiopian population was questioned. To address this problem, a new body mass index cut-off was developed for Ethiopian adults using population-specific data. However, its performance in diagnosing  has not been validated. Therefore, this study determined the performance of the newly developed Ethiopian and World Health Organization (WHO) BMI cut-offs in detecting  among Ethiopian adults.A cross-sectional study was carried out among 704 employees of Jimma University from February to April 2015. The study participants were selected using simple random sampling technique based on their payroll. Data on sociodemographic variables were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Anthropometric parameters including body weight and height were measured according to WHO recommendation. Body fat percentage (BF%) was measured using the air displacement plethysmography (ADP) after calibration of the machine. The diagnostic accuracy of the WHO BMI cut-off (≥ 30 kg/m) for  in both sexes and Ethiopian BMI cut-off (> 22.2 kg/m for males and >  24.5 kg/m for females) were compared to  diagnosed using ADP measured body fat percentage (> 35% for females and >  25% for males). Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and kappa agreements were determined to validate the performance of the BMI cut-offs.In males, WHO BMI cut-off has a sensitivity of 5.3% and specificity of 99.4% (Kappa = 0.047) indicating a slight agreement. However, the Ethiopian cut-off showed a sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 87.7% (Kappa = 0.752) indicating a substantial agreement. Similarly, in females, the WHO BMI cut-off showed a sensitivity of 46.9%, while its specificity was 100% (Kappa = 0.219) showing a fair agreement. The Ethiopian BMI cut-off demonstrated a sensitivity 80.0% and a specificity 95.6% (Kappa = 0.701) showing a substantial agreement. The WHO BMI cut-off underestimated the prevalence of  by a maximum of 73.7% and by a minimum of 28.3% among males, while the values for underestimation ranged from 31.4-54.1% in females. The misclassification was minimal using the newly developed Ethiopian BMI cut-off. The prevalence of  was underestimated by a maximum of 9.2% and overestimated by a maximum of 6.2%. The WHO BMI cut-off failed to identify nearly half (46.6%) of Ethiopian adults who met the criteria for  using BF% in the overall sample.The findings suggest that WHO BMI cut-off (≥ 30 kg/m) is not appropriate for screening  among Ethiopian adults. The newly developed Ethiopian BMI cut-off showed a better performance with excellent sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and agreement indicating the diagnostic significance of it use as a simple, cost-effective, and valid indicator in clinical and community setups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664383>Sleep pattern,  and healthcare expenditures in Brazilian adults.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between sleep pattern and healthcare expenditures in adults, as well as to identify whether physical activity, biochemical markers and  affect this relationship.

Currently, there are little to no data describing prevalences and correlates of movement behaviours among children in low-middle-income countries. The few available reports do not include both urban and rural respondents, despite the large proportion of rural populations in low-middle-income countries. We compared the prevalence of meeting 24-h movement guidelines and examined correlates of meeting the guidelines in a sample of urban and rural Mozambican schoolchildren.This is cross-sectional study of 9-11 year-old children (n = 683) recruited from 10 urban and 7 rural schools in Mozambique. Moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and sleep duration were measured by waist-worn Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers. Accelerometers were worn 24 h/day for up to 8 days. Recreational screen time was self-reported. Potential correlates of meeting 24-h movement guidelines were directly measured or obtained from validated items of context-adapted questionnaires. Multilevel multivariable logit models were used to determine the correlates of movement behaviours. Meeting 24-h movement guidelines was defined as ≥60 min/day of MVPA, ≤2 h/day of recreational screen time, and between 9 and 11 h/night of sleep.More rural (17.7%) than urban (3.6%) children met all three 24-h movement guidelines. Mean MVPA was lower (82.9 ± 29.5 min/day) among urban than rural children (96.7 ± 31.8 min/day). Rural children had longer sleep duration (8.9 ± 0.7 h/night) and shorter recreational screen time (2.7 ± 1.9 h/day) than their urban counterparts (8.7 ± 0.9 h/night and 5.0 ± 2.3 h/day respectively). Parental education (OR: 0.37; CI: 0.16-0.87), school location (OR: 0.21; CI: 0.09-0.52), and outdoor time (OR: 0.67; CI: 0.53-0.85) were significant correlates of meeting all three 24-h movement guidelines.Prevalence and correlates of meeting movement guidelines differed between urban and rural schoolchildren in Mozambique. On average, both groups had higher daily MVPA minutes, shorter sleep duration, and higher recreational screen time than the 24-h movement guidelines recommend. These findings (e.g., higher than recommended mean daily MVPA minutes) differ from those from high-income countries and highlight the need to sample from both urban and rural areas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664418>Changes in the intestinal microbiota of superobese patients after bariatric surgery.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota is associated with  and weight loss after bariatric surgery and has been related to its changing pattern.

These should be evaluated before and after active hypercortisolism, and each should be treated specifically. Antihypertensives may be chosen based on probable pathophysiology. Thus, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensinogen system are recommended. Mineralocorticoid antagonists are helpful in hypokalemic patients. Other agents are often needed to normalize blood pressure.

To understand how these interactions contribute to metabolic homeostasis and disease states, we analysed the steady state response of metabolic regulation (catabolic or anabolic) with respect to structural and input perturbations in the integrated signalling network, for varying levels of plasma glucose. Structural perturbations revealed: the positive feedback of AKT on IRS is responsible for the bistability in anabolic zone (glucose >5.5 mmol); the positive feedback of calcium on cAMP is responsible for ensuring ultrasensitive response in catabolic zone (glucose <4.5 mmol); the crosstalk between AKT and PDE3 is responsible for efficient catabolic response under low glucose condition; the crosstalk between DAG and PKC regulates the span of anabolic bistable region with respect to plasma glucose levels. The macronutrient perturbations revealed: varying plasma amino acids and fatty acids from normal to high levels gradually shifted the bistable response towards higher glucose range, eventually making the response catabolic or unresponsive to increasing glucose levels. The analysis reveals that certain macronutrient composition may be more conducive to homeostasis than others. The network perturbations that may contribute to disease states such as diabetes,  and cancer are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664579>Performing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in an obese patient with systemic lupus erythematosus undergoing long-term steroid therapy: a case report.</a></h2><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic inflammatory lesions, is often associated with .  aggravates symptoms of SLE; however, these symptoms can be improved by weight loss through diet therapy and bariatric surgery. However, there are only a few reports regarding the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in obese patients with SLE. Herein, we discuss the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) performed in an obese patient with SLE while undergoing long-term steroid therapy.A 36-year-old female, suffering from SLE for 10 years with effects on the central nervous system, developed diabetes mellitus (DM) triggered by the steroid therapy for SLE. The patient was undergoing steroid therapy (6 mg/day) for SLE since a long time. For DM management, her HbA1c level was maintained at 7.4%. She was 158 cm tall and 91.6 kg in weight. Her body mass index was 36.7. She could not work and depended on welfare services. To improve her  and DM, physicians suggested that she should undergo bariatric surgery in our hospital. Eventually, she underwent LSG, which lasted for 185 min, with minimal blood loss and without complications. Her blood glucose level stabilized immediately after the surgery; hence, her antidiabetic medication was discontinued. She was discharged 8 days after surgery, and her weight decreased steadily. In the first year after surgery, her weight was 54.4 kg, and she had lost approximately 37 kg from her initial weight. Her steroid requirement had also reduced to 4 mg/day. Through weight loss, she could begin to work and became a part of society again.LSG was safely performed in an obese patient with SLE undergoing long-term steroid therapy. We noted substantial weight loss, improved DM condition, and reduced requirement of SLE therapy after surgery. Hence, surgical risks must be carefully examined before patients undergo bariatric surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656291>The Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy on  and -related Disease : the Results of 10 Initial Cases.</a></h2><p>Introduction : The number of patients who undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been increasing.

Rosiglitazone is a synthetic ligand while 15-deoxy-Δ -prostaglandin J (15d-PGJ ) is the endogenous agonist of PPARγ. Reticulon 4B (Nogo-B) is the detectable Nogo protein family member in the liver and secreted into circulation. Herein, we determined if rosiglitazone can alleviate intrahepatic cholestasis in mice.Wild type, hepatocyte-specific PPARγ or Nogo-B knockout mice received intragastric administration of α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) and/or rosiglitazone, followed by determination of intrahepatic cholestasis and the involved mechanisms. Serum samples were collected from PBC patients and non-PBC controls to analyze cholestasis-related serum parameters.Rosiglitazone prevented wild type but not hepatocyte-specific PPARγ deficient mice from ANIT-induced intrahepatic cholestasis by activating expression of bile homeostatic molecules, reducing hepatic necrosis, and correcting abnormal serum parameters and bile enterohepatic circulation. Nogo-B deficiency had similar protections to rosiglitazone. ANIT-induced intrahepatic cholestasis reduced 15d-PGJ but increased Nogo-B in serum, and both were corrected by rosiglitazone. Nogo-B deficiency in the liver boosted 15d-PGJ production, thereby activating expression of PPARγ and bile homeostatic molecules. Rosiglitazone and Nogo-B deficiency also alleviated cholestasis-associated dyslipidemia. Furthermore, reduced 15d-PGJ and increased Nogo-B in PBC patients' serum were determined, with a negative or positive correlation to classical cholestatic parameters.

We investigated the association between pre-pregnancy BMI and the risk of SGA infants in a Chinese population. We performed a cohort study among 12029 mothers with a pregnancy. This cohort consisted of pregnant women that were: normal-weight (62.02%), underweight (17.09%), overweight (17.77%) and obese (3.12%). Birth sizes were reduced in the underweight and obese groups compared with the normal-weight group. Linear regression analysis indicated that birth size was positively associated with BMI in both the underweight and normal-weight groups. Further analysis showed that 12.74% of neonates were SGA infants in the underweight group, higher than 7.43% of neonates reported in the normal-weight group (adjusted RR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.61, 2.30). Unexpectedly, 17.60% of neonates were SGA infants in the obese group, much higher than the normal-weight group (adjusted RR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.57, 3.00). Additionally, 18.40% of neonates were large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants in the obese group, higher than 7.26% of neonates reported in the normal-weight group (adjusted RR = 3.00; 95% CI: 2.21, 4.06). These results suggest that pre-pregnancy underweight increases the risk of SGA infants, whereas  increases the risks of not only LGA infants, but also SGA infants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655853>Histone deacetylase inhibitor CG200745 ameliorates high-fat diet-induced hypertension via inhibition of angiotensin II production.</a></h2><p> is growing rapidly worldwide due to consumption of westernized diet and lack of exercise.  is one of the major risk factors of hypertension. The novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor CG200745 was originally developed to treat various cancers. Previous studies showed that CG200745 attenuated hypertension through inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in deoxycorticosterone acetate-induced hypertensive rat. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of CG200745 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hypertension. Nine-week old C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet (ND) or HFD for 17 weeks. Each group of mice was treated with vehicle or CG200745 by intraperitoneal injection for 9 days. HFD group showed higher body weight, blood pressure (BP), HDAC activities, angiotensinogen and renin expressions in kidney, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) expression in the lung, serum angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration, and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation in mesenteric artery compared with ND group. CG200745 lowered BP, HDAC activity, renin and angiotensinogen in the kidney, ACE in the lung, serum Ang II level, and phosphorylation of MLC in HFD group. In conclusion, CG200745 ameliorated HFD-induced hypertension through inhibition of HDAC/Ang II/vascular contraction axis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the alterations in serum oestradiol and adiponectin levels and in the expression of some important genes in the uterine and ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. The therapeutic effect of quercetin on PCOS was also assessed. Rats were divided into five groups: control, ethanol, quercetin (Q), PCOS and PCOS+Q. After 30 days of oral treatments, the rats' ovaries and uteri were removed and nesfatin-1, aromatase and adipoR1 expressions were quantified with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Serum adiponectin and oestradiol levels were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. The results of this study showed that expression of nesfatin-1 and adipoR1 genes and adiponectin serum levels decreased in the PCOS rats, but aromatase expression and oestradiol level increased. Treatment with quercetin increased the adiponectin level and expression of adipoR1 and nesfatin-1 and decreased both the expression of aromatase and the oestradiol level. Quercetin improved PCOS by phytoestrogenic effects and mimicking oestrogen's function.

We excluded patients with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus and any other type of diabetes.We collected data on diabetes-related comorbidities (ie, chronic complications, associated cardiovascular risk factors and treatment complications). Diagnoses were based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10 Revision codes recorded in the database or, for some entities, on the cut-off points for a particular test result or a specific treatment indicated for that entity. The presence and stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) were based on the glomerular filtration rate, the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine equation and the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio.A total of 373 185 patients were analysed. 82% of patients exhibited ≥2 comorbidities and 31% exhibited ≥4 comorbidities. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (72%), hyperlipidaemia (60%),  (45%), CKD (33%), chronic renal failure (CRF)(28%) and cardiovascular disease (23%). The most frequently coprevalent pairs of chronic conditions were the combination of hypertension with hyperlipidaemia (45%),  (35%), CKD (28%), CRF (25%) or cardiovascular disease (19%), as well as the combination of hyperlipidaemia with  (28%), CKD (21%), CRF (18%) or cardiovascular disease (15%); other common pairs of comorbidities were /CKD, /CRF, hypertension/retinopathy, hypertension/albuminuria, hypertension/urinary tract infection, CVD/CRF and CVD/CKD, which were each present in more than 10% of patients.Patients with type 2 diabetes have a high frequency of coprevalence of metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease and CKD and thus require an integrated management approach.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The accumulation of senescent cells is considered a hallmark of aging and thought to contribute to the aging pathologies. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates a myriad of cellular processes and has important roles in embryonic development, physiological tissue homeostasis, and various pathological conditions. TGF-β exerts potent growth inhibitory activities in various cell types, and multiple growth regulatory mechanisms have reportedly been linked to the phenotypes of cellular senescence and stem cell aging in previous studies. In addition, accumulated evidence has indicated a multifaceted association between TGF-β signaling and aging-associated disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, muscle atrophy, and . The findings regarding these diseases suggest that the impairment of TGF-β signaling in certain cell types and the upregulation of TGF-β ligands contribute to cell degeneration, tissue fibrosis, inflammation, decreased regeneration capacity, and metabolic malfunction. While the biological roles of TGF-β depend highly on cell types and cellular contexts, aging-associated changes are an important additional context which warrants further investigation to better understand the involvement in various diseases and develop therapeutic options. The present review summarizes the relationships between TGF-β signaling and cellular senescence, stem cell aging, and aging-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662026>Adapting a Prediction Rule for Metabolic Syndrome Risk Assessment Suitable for Developing Countries.</a></h2><p> Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardiometabolic disturbances that increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The early identification of high-risk individuals is the key for halting these conditions. The world is facing a growing epidemic MetS although the magnitude in Egypt is unknown.  To describe MetS and its determinants among apparently healthy individuals residing in urban and rural communities in Egypt and to establish a model for MetS prediction.  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt. Participants were clinically evaluated and interviewed for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary habits. MetS was defined according to the harmonized criteria set by the AHA/NHLBI. The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and fatty liver were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and fatty liver. Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were  [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid  [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (5.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (2.23-8.61)]. Consumption of caffeine once per week protected against MetS by 27.8-fold. The derived prediction rule was accurate in predicting MetS, fatty liver, high risk of DM, and, to a lesser extent, a 10-year lifetime risk of IHD.  Central  and sedentary lifestyles are accountable for the rising rates of MetS in our society.

However, little is known about the effect of acute mood states on vascular function. Here we examine the relation between vascular function and mood state in individuals with bipolar disorder.This prospective study followed 40 individuals with bipolar disorder for up to 6 months. Participants were assessed for mood state and vascular function at baseline, 2 weeks, and 6 months. Mood state was determined using clinician-administered Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale. Vascular function was assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, forearm vascular resistance (FVR), and arterial stiffness.Participants had a mean age of 30.1 years and 75% were male. Primary outcome measures FMD and nitroglycerine-mediated dilation were not found to have statistically significant associations with depressive or manic symptoms. In unadjusted models, higher manic symptoms were significantly associated with increased FVR nitroprusside-mediated dilation and diastolic blood pressure. In adjusted models, higher depressive symptoms were significantly associated with increases in augmentation index adjusted for heart rate of 75 bpm, and higher manic symptoms remained associated with increases in diastolic blood pressure.FMD may have limited sensitivity as a biomarker for measuring short-term effects of mood state. Longer-term prospective studies are needed to clarify the temporal relation between chronic mood symptoms and vascular function in bipolar disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656624>Association between adiposity levels and cognitive impairment in the Chilean older adult population.</a></h2><p>Although both  and ageing are risk factors for cognitive impairment, there is no evidence in Chile on how  levels are associated with cognitive function.

Cognitive impairment was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination. BMI and waist circumference (WC) were used as measures of adiposity. Compared with people with a normal BMI, the odds of cognitive impairment were higher in participants who were underweight (OR 4·44; 95 % CI 2·43, 6·45;  < 0·0001), overweight (OR 1·86; 95 % CI 1·06, 2·66;  = 0·031) and obese (OR 2·26; 95 % CI 1·31, 3·21;  = 0·003). The associations were robust after adjustment for confounding variables. Similar results were observed for WC.

These pathological conditions make mitochondria of a particular interest in the regulation of cell function and death by both apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate mitochondria function, autophagy and apoptosis protein markers in the kidney from rat model of intra-abdominal  and renal damage induced by high sucrose diet. Mitochondria from sucrose fed (SF) kidney in the presence of pyruvate/malate generated hydrogen peroxide (HO) at a higher rate than from control (79.81 ± 4.98 vs 65.84 ± 1.95 pmol/min/mg protein). With succinate, the release of HO was significantly higher compared with pyruvate/malate and it remained higher in SF than in control mitochondria (146.4 ± 8.8 vs 106.1 ± 5.9 pmol/min/mg protein). However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney mitochondria was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF mitochondria due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin. Cardiolipin was also found enriched with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids which are less susceptible to peroxidative stress involved in cytochrome c release. Furthermore, Beclin-1, LC3-B, as autophagy protein markers, and caspase 9 as apoptosis protein marker, were found decreased in SF kidney. These results suggest that the decline of autophagy protein markers and the lack of apoptosis process could be a pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction leading to the progression of renal disease in SF rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661739>Associations between dietary patterns and metabolic syndrome in adolescents.</a></h2><p>Evaluate association of dietary patterns with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and metabolic markers.654 adolescents from Guadalajara, Jalisco, participated in a cross-sectional study.

Instruments used to measure QoL included: SF-36, EQ-5D, KOOS, WHOQOL, HAS, AIMS, NHP and JKOM. All studies reported worse QoL in KOA patients when compared to a control group. When females were compared to males, females reported worse QOL.  as well as lower level of physical activity were reported with lower QoL scores. Knee self-management programs delivered by healthcare professionals improved QoL in patients with KOA. Educational level and higher total mindfulness were reported to improve QoL whereas poverty, psychological distress, depression and lacking familial relationships reduce it. Surgical KOA interventions resulted in good to excellent outcomes generally; although, results varied by age, weight, and depression.KOA has a substantial impact on QoL. In KOA patients, QoL is also influenced by specific individual factors including gender, body weight, physical activity, mental health, and education. Importantly, education and management programs designed to support KOA patients report improved QoL.

However, there are concerns regarding potential adverse effects on body composition.To compare the long-term effects of weight loss via severe vs moderate energy restriction on lean mass and other aspects of body composition.The Type of Energy Manipulation for Promoting Optimum Metabolic Health and Body Composition in  (TEMPO) Diet Trial was a 12-month, single-center, randomized clinical trial. A total of 101 postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 65 years with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) from 30 to 40, who were at least 5 years after menopause, had fewer than 3 hours of structured physical activity per week, and lived in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia, were recruited between March 2013 and July 2016. Data analysis was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019.Participants were randomized to either 12 months of moderate (25%-35%) energy restriction with a food-based diet (moderate intervention) or 4 months of severe (65%-75%) energy restriction with a total meal replacement diet followed by moderate energy restriction for an additional 8 months (severe intervention). Both interventions had a prescribed protein intake of 1.0 g/kg of actual body weight per day, and physical activity was encouraged but not supervised.The primary outcome was whole-body lean mass at 12 months after commencement of intervention. Secondary outcomes were body weight, thigh muscle area and muscle function (strength), bone mineral density, and fat mass and distribution, measured at 0, 4, 6, and 12 months.A total of 101 postmenopausal women were recruited (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [4.2] years; mean [SD] weight, 90.8 [9.1] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 34.4 [2.5]). Compared with the moderate group at 12 months, the severe group lost more weight (effect size, -6.6 kg; 95% CI, -8.2 to -5.1 kg), lost more whole-body lean mass (effect size, -1.2 kg; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4 kg), and lost more thigh muscle area (effect size, -4.2 cm2; 95% CI, -6.5 to -1.9 cm2). However, decreases in whole-body lean mass and thigh muscle area were proportional to total weight loss, and there was no difference in muscle (handgrip) strength between groups. Total hip bone mineral density (effect size, -0.017 g/cm2; 95% CI, -0.029 to -0.005 g/cm2), whole-body fat mass (effect size, -5.5 kg; 95% CI, -7.1 to -3.9 kg), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (effect size, -1890 cm3; 95% CI, -2560 to -1219 cm3), and visceral adipose tissue (effect size, -1389 cm3; 95% CI, -1748 to -1030 cm3) loss were also greater for the severe group than for the moderate group at 12 months.Severe energy restriction had no greater adverse effect on relative whole-body lean mass or handgrip strength compared with moderate energy restriction and was associated with 2-fold greater weight and fat loss over 12 months. However, there was significantly greater loss of total hip bone mineral density with severe vs moderate energy restriction.

The family is also related to a healthy status in a number of other different disease contexts, including  and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, Christensenellaceae is highly heritable across multiple populations, although specific human genes underlying its heritability have so far been elusive. Further research into the microbial ecology and metabolism of these bacteria should reveal mechanistic underpinnings of their host-health associations and enable their development as therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662187>Correlates of psychiatric inpatient readmissions of children and adolescents with mental disorders.</a></h2><p>To identify correlates of psychiatric readmission of youth, we conducted a consecutive, retrospective 1-year cohort study (07.01.2014-06.30.2015) of youth (age = 5-17.9) admitted to psychiatric inpatient facility. Stepwise elimination, multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify independent correlates of 1-year and 30-day psychiatric readmissions. The Family/Caregiver Interview Tool (FCIT) was given to caregivers of 30-day readmitted youth and analyzed using generalized linear model to predict time to readmission. Altogether, 1231 youth experienced 1534 hospitalizations. The 1-year readmission rate was 32.4%; 30-day readmission rate was 10.2%. Significant independent correlates of readmissions were longer length of stay, higher antipsychotic treatment rates, living closer to the hospital, and comorbid , all accounting for 12.2% of variance. FCIT revealed that caregiver's ability to fill prescription after discharge delayed readmission, while shorter time to follow-up appointment hastened it. Illness exacerbation was responsible for 73% of 30-day readmissions; system of care factors accounted for 13%. Compared to clinicians, caregivers significantly underestimated environment of care factors (including caregiver's mental health) as the primary cause for readmission. Readmissions are common and correlate with illness severity and systems of care factors. Family support services may help reduce readmissions. Hospital-specific qualitative investigation may help identify intervention targets to reduce readmissions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Rare cases of loss-of-functions mutations affecting leptin and its receptor, as well as polymorphisms concerning ghrelin and its receptor, have been documented in human , apparently validating the relevance of leptin and ghrelin for human physiology. Paradoxically, however, the overwhelming majority of obese individuals manifest high leptin and low ghrelin plasma levels, suggesting that both factors are not directly disease-relevant. We recently discovered that acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), also known as diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), acts as an efficient lipogenic and appetite stimulator in mice. Indeed, in response to starvation, ACBP/DBI is released from tissues in an autophagy-dependent fashion and increases in the plasma. Intravenous injection of ACBP/DBI stimulates feeding behavior through a reduction of circulating glucose levels, and consequent activation of orexigenic neurons in the hypothalamus. In contrast, neutralization of ACBP/DBI abolishes the hyperphagia observed after starvation of mice. Of note, ACBP/DBI is increased in the plasma of obese persons and mice, pointing to a convergence (rather than divergence) between its role in appetite stimulation and human . Based on our results, we postulate a novel 'hunger reflex' in which starvation induces a surge in extracellular ACBP/DBI, which in turn stimulates feeding behavior. Thus, ACBP/DBI might be the elusive 'hunger factor' that explains increased food uptake in .Copyright: © 2019 Bravo-San Pedro et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661672>Elucidating the role of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in metabolic PCOS models.</a></h2><p>PCOS is the most common endocrinopathy in women; associated with  and insulin resistance (IR). IR leads to accumulation of advanced-glycation-end-products (AGEs) and their receptor, RAGE. PCOS patients have increased levels of vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (VEGF), interleukin 6/8 (IL-6/8) and anti-Mϋllerian-hormone (AMH). PEDF is a secreted-glycoprotein known for its anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. We aimed to elucidate the role of PEDF in the pathogenesis and treatment of PCOS. We used a prenatal PCOS mouse model and fed the female offspring a high-fat-diet, inducing metabolic PCOS (met.PCOS) characteristics. Female offspring were divided into three groups: control; met.PCOS; met.PCOS+recombinant PEDF (rPEDF). Met.PCOS mice gained more weight, had elevated serum IL-6 and higher mRNA levels of AMH, PEDF and RAGE in their granulosa-cells (GCs) than met.PCOS+rPEDF mice. An in-vitro met.PCOS model in human GCs (KGN) line was induced by prolonged incubation with insulin/AGEs, causing development of IR. Under the same conditions, we observed an elevation of VEGF, IL-6/8 mRNAs, concomitantly with an increase in PEDF mRNA, intracellular protein levels, and an elevation of PEDF receptors (PEDF-Rs) mRNA and protein. Simultaneously, a reduction in the secretion of PEDF from GCs, was measured in the medium. The addition of rPEDF (5nM) activated P38 signaling, implying that PEDF-Rs maintained functionality, and negated AGE-induced elevation of IL-6/8 and VEGF mRNAs. Decreased PEDF secretion may be a major contributor to hyper-angiogenesis and chronic inflammation, which lie at the core of PCOS pathogenesis. rPEDF treatment may restore physiological angiogenesis-inflammatory balance, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic role in PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665164>Caesarean section delivery and childhood  in a British longitudinal cohort study.</a></h2><p>Several studies reported an association between Caesarean section (CS) birth and childhood . However, there are several limitations in the current literature. These include an inability to distinguish between planned and emergency CS, small study sample sizes and not adjusting for pre-pregnancy body-mass-index (BMI). We examined the association between CS delivery and childhood  using the United Kingdom Millennium Cohort Study (MCS).Mother-infant pairs were recruited into the MCS. Use of sampling weights ensured the sample was representative of the population. The exposure was categorised as normal vaginal delivery (VD) [reference], assisted VD, planned CS and emergency CS. Childhood  prevalence, at age three, five, seven, eleven and fourteen years was calculated using the International  Taskforce criteria. Mixed-effects linear regression models were fitted with associations adjusted for several potential confounders like maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, education and infant macrosomia. Linear regression models were fitted evaluating body fat percentage (BF%), at age seven and fourteen years.Of the 18,116 infants, 3872 (21.4%) were delivered by CS; 9.2% by planned CS.  prevalence was 5.4%, 5.7%, 6.5%, 7.1% and 7.6% at age three, five, seven, eleven and fourteen years respectively. The mixed-effects linear regression model showed no association between planned (adjusted mean difference = 0.00; [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10; 0.10], p-value = 0.97) or emergency CS (adjusted mean difference = 0.08; [95% CI -0.01; 0.17], p-value = 0.09) and child BMI. At age seven years, there was no association between planned CS and BF% (adjusted mean difference = 0.13; [95% CI -0.23; 0.49]); there was no association at age fourteen years.Infants born by planned CS did not have a significantly higher BMI or BF% compared to those born by normal VD. This may suggest that the association, described in the literature, could be due to the indications/reasons for CS birth or residual confounding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663475>Gum Acacia Functional Significance in the Management of .</a></h2><p>Consumption of diets rich in fat and refined sugars are recognized to be the cause of altered intestinal functionality and metabolic disorders like , insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

However, the role of assisted reproductive technology (ART) in increasing the risk of insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated with GDM remained elusive. The current study aimed to determine the role of ART in predicting insulin therapy in GDM women and investigate the clinical and biochemical factors predicting the need for insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated with GDM.In this prospective cohort study, 236 Iranian women with GDM were diagnosed by one-step oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between October 2014 and June 2017. They were mainly assigned to two groups; the first group (n = 100) was designated as ART which was further subdivided into two subgroups as follows: 60 participants who received medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and 40 participants who received MNT plus insulin therapy (MNT-IT). The second group (n = 136) was labeled as the spontaneous conception (SC), consisting of 102 participants receiving MNT and 34 participants receiving MNT in combination with IT (MNT-IT). The demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were compared between groups. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate prognostic factors for insulin therapy.A higher rate of insulin therapy was observed in the ART group as compared with the SC group (40% vs. 25%; P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that maternal age ≥ 35 years [OR: 2.91, 95% CI: (1.28-6.62)], high serum FBS [1.10: (1.04-1.16)], HbA1c [1.91 (1.09-3.34)], and ART treatment [2.94: (1.24-6.96)] were independent risk factors for insulin therapy in GDM women.Apart from risk factors mentioned earlier, ART may be a possible prognostic factor for insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated with GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664652>Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Female Sexual Function in Obese Patients: a Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>We aimed to make a meta-analysis regarding the effect of bariatric surgery on female sexual function.

These structural variants are present in 0.5% to 1.0% of the population, making 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 the site of the most prevalent known pathogenic copy number variation (CNV). It is unknown to what extent this CNV influences brain structure and affects cognitive abilities.To determine the association of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion and duplication CNVs with cortical and subcortical brain morphology and cognitive task performance.In this genetic association study, T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging were combined with genetic data from the ENIGMA-CNV consortium and the UK Biobank, with a replication cohort from Iceland. In total, 203 deletion carriers, 45 247 noncarriers, and 306 duplication carriers were included. Data were collected from August 2015 to April 2019, and data were analyzed from September 2018 to September 2019.The associations of the CNV with global and regional measures of surface area and cortical thickness as well as subcortical volumes were investigated, correcting for age, age2, sex, scanner, and intracranial volume. Additionally, measures of cognitive ability were analyzed in the full UK Biobank cohort.Of 45 756 included individuals, the mean (SD) age was 55.8 (18.3) years, and 23 754 (51.9%) were female. Compared with noncarriers, deletion carriers had a lower surface area (Cohen d = -0.41; SE, 0.08; P = 4.9 × 10-8), thicker cortex (Cohen d = 0.36; SE, 0.07; P = 1.3 × 10-7), and a smaller nucleus accumbens (Cohen d = -0.27; SE, 0.07; P = 7.3 × 10-5). There was also a significant negative dose response on cortical thickness (β = -0.24; SE, 0.05; P = 6.8 × 10-7). Regional cortical analyses showed a localization of the effects to the frontal, cingulate, and parietal lobes. Further, cognitive ability was lower for deletion carriers compared with noncarriers on 5 of 7 tasks.These findings, from the largest CNV neuroimaging study to date, provide evidence that 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 structural variation is associated with brain morphology and cognition, with deletion carriers being particularly affected. The pattern of results fits with known molecular functions of genes in the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region and suggests involvement of these genes in neuronal plasticity. These neurobiological effects likely contribute to the association of this CNV with neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665202>Dietary quality among children from 6 months to 4 years, NHANES 2011-2016.</a></h2><p>The US Dietary Guidelines for Americans provide dietary recommendations for individuals aged ≥2 y and metrics exist to assess alignment.

The impact of sugar on health centres on , diabetes and dental caries; these also have a disproportionate impact upon low income communities. Sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) are recognised as a universal major source of sugar, and it has been recommended that the amount and frequency of intake of SSBs should be limited. SSB taxes are a possible way of reducing sugar intake, as well as an effective method of integrating oral health (OH) into general health promotion. There is widespread support for these taxes from PH professionals as they have the potential to improve diet and nutrition, and by OH professionals since nutrition is an integral component of OH, and sugar reduction can reduce the incidence of caries. SSB taxes can also generate revenues which can be reinvested in healthcare to further health improvement. Despite the self-evident benefits for integration, few countries have made a concentrated effort to integrate.

Observational studies in COPD indicate that low body mass index (BMI) is associated with worse outcomes, and overweight/ has a protective effect - the so-called " paradox". We aimed to determine the relationship between BMI and the rate of FEV decline in data from published clinical trials in COPD.We performed a systematic review of the literature, and identified 5 randomized controlled trials reporting the association between BMI and FEV decline. Four of these were included in the meta-analyses. We analyzed BMI in 4 categories: BMI-I (< 18.5 or <  20 kg/m), BMI-II (18.5 or 20 to < 25 kg/m), BMI-III (25 to < 29 or < 30 kg/m) and BMI-IV (≥29 or ≥ 30 kg/m). We then performed a meta-regression of all the estimates against the BMI category.The estimated rate of FEV decline decreased with increasing BMI. Meta-regression of the estimates showed that BMI was significantly associated with the rate of FEV decline (linear trend p = 1.21 × 10).These novel findings support the  paradox in COPD: compared to normal BMI, low BMI is a risk factor for accelerated lung function decline, whilst high BMI has a protective effect.

In this study, we evaluated several anthropometric measurements for the prediction of HTN in middle-aged and elderly populations in Taiwan.Cross-sectional observational study.Community-based investigation in Guishan Township of northern Taiwan.A total of 396 people were recruited from a northern Taiwan community for a cross-sectional study. Anthropometrics and blood pressure were measured at the annual health exam. The  indices included body mass index (BMI), body fat (BF) percentage and waist circumference (WC).Statistical analyses, including Pearson's correlation, multiple logistic regression and the area under ROC curves (AUCs) between HTN and anthropometric measurements, were used in this study.Of the 396 people recruited, 200 had HTN.

Antenatal care provided by a general practitioner (GP) in the primary care setting is an important model of care, particularly for women in regional areas where rates of overweight and  are highest. The aim of this study is to explore GPs' perceptions and experiences of implementing GWG recommendations in GP-led antenatal care.A qualitative exploratory approach recorded GPs' experiences and insights regarding the application of GWG recommendations in practice. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews informed by the revised Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Deductive thematic analysis grouped coded text into TDF domains from which main themes were generated.Twenty GPs (13 female, 7 male) from metropolitan and regional Victoria, Australia participated. Codes related to at least one of 11 TDF domains. Five main themes were apparent: 1) Despite low awareness of guidelines, GWG advice is provided; 2) 'I should do this more'; 3) Lack of everyday resources; 4) Working 'against the odds' at times; and 5) Optimism and reality. GPs were aware of the importance of optimal GWG however, other pregnancy-related issues are given precedence during consultations. Enablers for the implementation of GWG guidelines were practitioner-based and included GPs' strong sense of their professional role to provide advice, and ongoing and trusting relationships with women throughout pregnancy. Barriers were mostly health system-based with limited time, remuneration, and restrictive referral pathways being limiting factors.There is a need to support GPs to provide GWG advice in accordance with current national guidelines.

We examined the frequency and phenotype of circulating preproinsulin (PPI)-specific and Insulin B (InsB)-specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children newly diagnosed with T1D and in high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children before the appearance of disease-specific autoantibodies and before diagnosis of T1D. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were detected using HLA class I tetramers and flow cytometry was used to assess memory status. In HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D, we observed an increase in PPI -specific transitional memory CD8+ T cells compared to non-diabetic, age- and HLA-matched subjects. Furthermore, PPI -specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D showed a significantly more antigen-experienced phenotype compared to polyclonal CD8+ T cells. In longitudinal samples from high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children, the percentage of terminal effector cells within the InsB -specific CD8+ T cells was increased before diagnosis relative to samples taken before the appearance of autoantibodies. This is the first study to report HLA-B*3906-restricted autoreactive CD8+ T cells in T1D. Collectively, our results provide evidence that β-cell-reactive CD8+ T cells restricted by disease-associated HLA class I molecules display an antigen-experienced phenotype and acquire enhanced effector function during the period leading to clinical diagnosis, implicating these cells in driving disease.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661887>Pyrogallol-Phloroglucinol-6,6-Bieckol Alleviates  and Systemic Inflammation in a Mouse Model by Reducing Expression of RAGE and RAGE Ligands.</a></h2><p> () can alleviate diet-induced  in animal models, and phlorotannins contained in  help prevent hypertrophy-induced adipocyte differentiation.

Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut microbiota, have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or 5 g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal microbiota analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti- property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly -associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress.

Lipodystrophy is also a source of major cardiovascular disorders which, in addition to hepatic failure and infection, contribute to a significant reduction in life expectancy.

Data are drawn from the Growing Up in Ireland suites of studies. Parents rated their child's personality at age 13, and trained staff measured weight and height at ages 13 and 17 ( = 4962). Logistic regression was used to predict risk of incident  and  remission between ages 13 and 17.  Among children who were not in the  category at age 13, higher Conscientiousness was associated with lower risk of moving into the  category by age 17, and, among children with  at age 13, Conscientiousness was associated with greater likelihood of moving to the nonobesity category by age 17. These associations were independent of sociodemographic characteristics, parent body mass index, and were similar across gender. The other five-factor model personality traits were unrelated to weight outcomes.

Serum leptin and ApN levels were determined by radioimmunoassay.Our results showed that serum ApN levels were significantly associated with  measures in both men and women, and the greater effect was observed in men. In contrast, the relationship between ApN and BMD was sex-dependent. Levels of ApN were negatively associated with BMD in women, but not in men. This relationship persisted even after adjustment for potential confounding factors, such as leptin and body mass index. Moreover, serum ApN was found to be a major determinant of BMD in women on the multivariate regression analysis.Our results suggest that ApN, an adipocyte-derived hormone, may affect bone metabolism, which may be mediated by sex hormones.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Impact of learning curves on operative outcome has been well shown, but the necessary learning curves have not been clearly defined. This study provides a systematic review of the literature and proposes a standardization of phases of learning curves for RYGB and LSG.A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases. All studies specifying a number or range of approaches to characterize the learning curve for RYGB and LSG were selected.A total of 28 publications related to learning curves for 27,770 performed bariatric surgeries were included. Parameters used to determine the learning curve were operative time, complications, conversions, length of stay, and blood loss. Learning curve range was 30-500 (RYGB) and 30-200 operations (LSG) according to different definitions and respective phases of learning curves. Learning phases described the number of procedures necessary to achieve predefined skill levels, such as competency, proficiency, and mastery.Definitions of learning curves for bariatric surgery are heterogeneous. Introduction of the three skill phases competency, proficiency, and mastery is proposed to provide a standardized definition using multiple outcome variables to enable better comparison in the future. These levels are reached after 30-70, 70-150, and up to 500 RYGB, and after 30-50, 60-100, and 100-200 LSG.

In recent years, the negative role of  during BC development and progression has been made abundantly clear in several studies. However, the distribution of body fat may be more important to analyze than the overall body weight. In our review of literature, we reported some key findings regarding the role of  in BC development, but focused more on central adiposity. Firstly, the adipose microenvironment in obese people bears many similarities with the tumor microenvironment, in respect to associated cellular composition, chronic low-grade inflammation, and high ratio of reactive oxygen species to antioxidants. Secondly, the adipose tissue functions as an endocrine organ, which in obese people produces a high level of tumor-promoting hormones, such as leptin and estrogen, and a low level of the tumor suppressor hormone, adiponectin. As follows, in BC this leads to the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways: NFκB, JAK, STAT3, AKT. Moreover, overall , but especially central , promotes a systemic and local low grade chronic inflammation that further stimulates the increase of tumor-promoting oxidative stress. Lastly, there is a constant exchange of information between BC cells and adipocytes, mediated especially by extracellular vesicles, and which changes the transcription profile of both cell types to an oncogenic one with the help of regulatory non-coding RNAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657463>Isothiazolinones in cleaning products.

We investigated trends in the age- and sex-adjusted body mass index (ISO-BMI) and the prevalence of malnutrition in a Finnish cohort of 139 consecutive children receiving chemotherapy for cancer, with a follow-up period of 42 months after diagnosis. In total, 28% (39/139) of the patients experienced malnutrition (ISO-BMI < 17 or > 10% weight loss), and 12% (16/139) had a nasogastric tube or underwent gastrostomy. Patients with acute or chronic myeloid leukemia (5/10), central nervous system (CNS) tumors (5/13), or solid tumors (13/31) most frequently suffered from malnutrition. There was a significant increase in the ISO-BMI of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (+ 2.1 kg/m) and lymphomas (+ 2.4 kg/m) during the first 6 months, and the ISO-BMI of patients with ALL remained higher at 42 months compared to baseline (+ 1.9 kg/m).Conclusion: The cumulative incidence of malnutrition in Finnish pediatric cancer patients is comparable to that reported in other populations.

However, the mechanism underlying this association remains poorly understood. In the present study, a gilt  model was developed by exposure to different energy diets and used to investigate the role of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) in the placenta. Specifically, 99 gilts (Guangdong Small-ear Spotted pig) at day 60 of gestation were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatments: low-energy group (L, DE = 11.50 MJ/kg), medium-energy group (M, DE = 12.41 MJ/kg), and high-energy group (H, DE = 13.42 MJ/kg), with 11 replicate pens per treatment and 3 gilts per pen. At the start of the study, maternal body weight and backfat thickness were not significantly different in the three treatments. After the study, data indicated that the H group had higher body weight and backfat thickness gain for gilts during gestation and lower piglet birth weight compared with the other two groups. Additionally, the H group showed glucolipid metabolic disorders and increased triglyceride and nonesterified fatty acid contents in the placenta of gilts. Compared with the L group, the H group exhibited lower mitochondrial biogenesis and increased oxidative damage in the placenta. Importantly, increased mRNA expression and protein abundance of Nox2 were observed for the first time in H group placentae. Furthermore, compared with the L group, the H group showed a decrease in the density of placental vessels and the protein levels of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (p-VEGFR2) as well as the immunostaining intensity of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31).

Preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1), a preadipocyte secreted protein, plays an inhibitory role in adipogenic differentiation. However, the role of Pref-1 in adipose tissue browning remains unknown. We investigated whether Pref-1 regulates thermogenic program and beige fat biogenesis.Pref-1 expression levels were examined in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes in thermogenic conditions induced by cold exposure or a beta-adrenergic stimulus (CL316,243). Overexpression and knockdown studies were performed both in vivo and in vitro to clarify the role of Pref-1 in iWAT browning.Cold exposure or CL316,243 induced a thermogenic program in adipose tissue of C57BL/6 N mice and in 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. Notably, Pref-1 levels were down-regulated in iWAT and adipocytes under these conditions. Overexpressing Pref-1 showed reduced thermogenic gene expressions in response to CL316,243 treatment, whereas depletion of Pref-1 augmented thermogenic program in 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. Correspondingly, treating C57BL/6 N mice with Pref-1 resulted in reduced expression of thermogenic and beige fat markers, a reduced rate of oxygen consumption, blunting of UCP1 expression and beige fat formation in iWAT in response to cold exposure or CL316,243 injection compared to the untreated mice. The opposite phenotype was observed in mice with inducible fat-specific knock-out of Pref-1. Mechanistically, these effects were regulated by modulation of TNF-α-converting enzyme activity and Pref-1 cleavage.Our findings establish a novel role of Pref-1 that regulates adaptive thermogenesis.

However, the direct link between internalized weight bias and stress response to acute stressors via cortisol secretion has not been investigated so far. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between internalized weight stigma as a stressor and cortisol reactivity in an acute psychosocial stress situation induced by the Trier Socials Stress Test for groups (TSST-G). Participants with BMI >30 kg/m (n = 79) were included in the study. Results reveal that while individuals with low internalized stigma reacted as predicted with an increase in cortisol secretion to acute psychosocial stress, individuals with medium or high internalized stigma did not show a typical cortisol response. However, these findings depend on the several factors, for instance on gender. In sum, acute stress in individuals with internalized weight bias seems to blunt HPA axis reactions to acute psychosocial stress.

It is still controversial as to whether OP is associated with either a low or high body mass index, but it is quite clear that the latter condition increases the risk for OA development. Bone marrow adipocytes (BMAs) have the same precursors of osteoblasts, which are the primary cells involved in bone formation, and the amount of BMAs appears to be inversely related to bone mineral density. Although adipokines released by these adipocytes influence bone loss progress, their exact role remains controversial. Differently, the infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP) is indicated to protect the function of joint regarding OA. However, there is relatively limited information about the secretion of adipokines and other inflammatory mediators by the IPFP. Despite some inconsistencies, nutritional interventions targeting  may also benefit patients with OP and OA. The association among , OP, and OA is quite complex, and many factors need to be explored that are mainly related to the role of adipokines derived locally rather than from visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Also, nutritional intervention may affect fatty tissue mass and secretion of inflammatory mediators that may, at least in part, influence other tissues in the organism such as bone and articular cartilage. The aim of this review was to present the latest knowledge about the interrelationship between  and OA or OP and to discuss whether a dietary intervention for  will hold promise for patients with OA or OP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

During this time, adult  grew by 5%.This study aimed to evaluate the demand and associated costs for hospital-based back surgery by geolocation over time to evaluate provider practice variation. The study then leveraged hierarchical time series to generate tight demand forecasts on an unobserved test set. Finally, explanatory financial, technical, workload, geographical, and temporal factors as well as state-level  rates were investigated as predictors for the demand for hospital-based back surgery.Hospital data from January 2012 to December 2017 were used to generate geospatial-temporal maps and a video of the Current Procedural Terminology codes beginning with the digit 63 claims. Hierarchical time series modeling provided forecasts for each state, the census regions, and the nation for an unobserved test set and then again for the out-years of 2018 and 2019. Stepwise regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, elastic net, and gradient-boosted random forests were built on a training set and evaluated on a test set to evaluate variables important to explaining the demand for hospital-based back surgery.Widespread, unexplained practice variation over time was seen using geographical information systems (GIS) multimedia mapping. Hierarchical time series provided accurate forecasts on a blind dataset and suggested a 6.52% (from 497,325 procedures in 2017 to 529,777 in 2018) growth of hospital-based back surgery in 2018 (529,777 and up to 13.00% by 2019 [from 497,325 procedures in 2017 to 563,023 procedures in 2019]). The increase in payments by 2019 are estimated to be US $323.9 million. Extreme gradient-boosted random forests beat constrained and unconstrained regression models on a 20% unobserved test set and suggested that  is one of the most important factors in explaining the increase in demand for hospital-based back surgery.Practice variation and  are factors to consider when estimating demand for hospital-based back surgery. Federal, state, and local planners should evaluate demand-side and supply-side interventions for this emerging problem.©Lawrence Fulton, Clemens Scott Kruse.
