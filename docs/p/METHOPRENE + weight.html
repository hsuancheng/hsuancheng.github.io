Treated commodities were stored at ambient conditions on the floor of an empty grain bin in Manhattan, KS, USA, in 5-kg lots for individual replicates. The commodities were sampled and bio-assayed every three months for 15 months by exposing 10 mixed-sex parental adults of selected adult stored product insects on 70⁻80 g of the commodity. For all treatments, there was no regression of declining efficacy with respect to the month. Therefore, the data were combined for analysis. On wheat and brown rice, there was no reproduction of  (Fabricius) in any of the treatments, and there was no  loss in either commodity that was caused by feeding of the parental adults or developing progeny. There was reproduction of  (L.) on wheat but, for several combinations, the EC formulation gave better suppression of progeny compared to the standard SC. However, on brown rice, only the combination of 1.0 ppm deltamethrin EC and 2.5 ppm  was different than other treatments with respect to progeny development, sample  loss caused by feeding, and  of the feeding damage itself. Progeny production was correlated with grain damage. No progeny of  (Herbst) developed on the treated corn, but there was some variation in insect damage, with less damage in those treatments involving the EC formulation. Progeny production of  (Motschulsky) was at the lowest in the combination of 1.0 ppm deltamethrin EC and 2.5 ppm . The resulting insect damage was the lowest in this combination as well. Results of this study were used by the registrant (Central Life Sciences) in the United States (US) to modify the commercial formulation to replace the deltamethrin SC with the EC, at label rates of either 0.5 ppm EC+ 1.25 ppm , or 1.0 ppm EC + 2.5 ppm , on wheat, corn, and rice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122282>Efficacy of a spot-on combination of fluralaner plus moxidectin (Bravecto Plus) in cats following repeated experimental challenge with a field isolate of Ctenocephalides felis.</a></h2><p>A spot-on formulation of fluralaner plus moxidectin has been designed to provide long-term protection against fleas and ticks, prevent heartworm disease and treat gastrointestinal nematode infections in cats. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of this product against fleas collected from a household with repeated fipronil failures following owner-administered treatments.Thirty cats were randomized to three equal groups: (A) untreated controls; (B) to receive a single application of fluralaner plus moxidectin (Bravecto Plus) at 40 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg , respectively; and (C) three applications at one month intervals with a spot-on formulation of fipronil and (S)- (Frontline Plus) at 0.5 ml manufacturer recommended dose. Flea challenges were completed on Days -6 (for randomization), -1, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 77, 84 and 91. Flea counts were completed 48 hours after initial treatment and 48 hours following each subsequent challenge.Fleas were found on all control and all fipronil and (S)- treated cats at every assessment. From Day 2 to Day 93, all cats in the fluralaner plus moxidectin group were flea-free, with one exception (Day 58; three fleas counted on one cat); control group flea counts ranged between 34-109, and fipronil and (S)- group counts ranged between 1-79. At each assessment after Day 0, compared to the control group, geometric mean flea counts were significantly lower in the fipronil and (S)- group (P ≤ 0.04) and in the fluralaner plus moxidectin group (P < 0.001), and mean flea counts in the fluralaner plus moxidectin group were significantly lower than those of the fipronil and (S)- group (P < 0.001). The efficacy of fluralaner plus moxidectin, based on geometric means, was 100% at each assessment post-Day 0 except on Day 58 when efficacy was 99.7%. In the fipronil and (S)- group efficacy ranged between 30.6-65.6%.These findings demonstrate complete efficacy of fluralaner plus moxidectin against a flea isolate that was not controlled by fipronil and (S)-. This study provides confirmation of the consistent, sustained efficacy of topically applied fluralaner in the treatment and control of flea infestations in cats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21777738>Efficacy of fipronil, amitraz and (S)- combination spot-on for dogs against adult dog fleas (Ctenocephalides canis, Curtis, 1826).</a></h2><p>A novel spot-on formulation combining fipronil, amitraz and (S)- (CERTIFECT™, Merial Limited, GA, USA) was evaluated in adult Beagle dogs in a study to determine its adulticidal efficacy against the dog flea (Ctenocephalides canis, Curtis, 1826). Sixteen dogs were randomly allocated to treatment groups: 8 dogs served as untreated controls, and 8 dogs were treated once. Treatment consisted of applying a new combination formulation to deliver at least 6.7mg fipronil/kg  (bw), 8.0mg amitraz/kg bw, and 6.0mg (S)-/kg bw. The combination was designed to enhance the efficacy against ticks of the original fipronil/(S)- combination. Each dog was infested with 100 adult unfed dog fleas within 24h prior to treatment and then at weekly intervals for 8 weeks after treatment. At 24h after treatment or after each subsequent infestation, each dog was combed thoroughly to remove live fleas to be counted. A single treatment with CERTIFECT provided excellent knock-down of fleas within 24h after treatment and controlled re-infestations for up to 7 weeks (efficacy ≥96.5%, p<0.05).Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The degree of parasitic castration, as assessed by measurements of testicular volume, was correlated with the stadium in which parasitization occurred. A mathematical formula requiring the measurement of testicular length, width and depth was used to calculate testicular volume. The use of the depth parameter revealed a negative correlation between host weight and testicular volume in parasitized larvae. Testicular volumes of fifth instar hosts, which had been parasitized in the first stadium, were significantly smaller than those originally parasitized as fourth or fifth instar larvae and were not correlated with parasitoid load. Effects of natural parasitism were not duplicated by injections of C. congregata polydnavirus and venom, topical treatment with the juvenile hormone analog , or starvation of nonparasitized larvae. Larvae receiving virus plus venom or  grew larger due to delayed wandering and had larger testes than controls. Deleterious effects on host testes may be due to the effects of nutrient competition between the developing parasitoid progeny and the gonads, combined with the juvenilizing effects believed to be caused by the polydnavirus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16039664>Relationship between an increase of juvenile hormone titer in early instars and the induction of diapause in fully grown larvae of Sesamia nonagrioides.</a></h2><p>The larvae of Sesamia nonagrioides (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) grown at 25 degrees C and long photoperiod (16:8h light:dark) pupate in the 5th or 6th (mostly) larval instar, while the larvae reared under a short photoperiod (12:12h) enter diapause during which they consume some food and undergo up to 12 (usually 3-4) stationary larval molts. Diapause programming includes an increase of juvenile hormone (JH) titer in the hemolymph from about 20 to 50 nM in the 4th and 5th instar larvae (titer in earlier instars was not measured). JH I, II, and III are present in approximate ratio 1-2:10:1. The JH titer drops to zero before pupation but remains around 20 nM during diapause. Perfect extra larval molts associated with a  increase can be induced in the non-diapausing larvae with a JH analogue (JHA). The  rise is due to accumulation of reserves and not to a general  growth. The timing of extra molts is similar to the molting pattern of the diapausing larvae only when JHA is present since early larval instars. In the diapausing larvae, JHA application affects neither molting periodicity nor the . It is concluded that (1) Increased JH titer in early larval instars is a part of diapause programming; (2) The extension of larval stage in the diapausing larvae, but not the timing pattern of extra molts, is due to continuously high JH titer; (3) The diapause program includes low food intake, maintenance of a certain , and periodic larval molts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703077>Efficacy of a single dose of a novel topical combination product containing eprinomectin to prevent heartworm infection in cats.</a></h2><p>Cats may be infected by heartworm, Dirofilaria immitis, through mosquito bites. They can develop severe heartworm disease when infective D. immitis larvae migrate and develop into adults in the pulmonary vasculature or other tissues. As there is no curative treatment for feline heartworm infection, the monthly administration of preventative treatment is recommended in endemic areas. Three controlled, blinded laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate the preventative efficacy of BROADLINE(®), a novel combination of fipronil, (S)-, eprinomectin, and praziquantel against D. immitis in cats. In each study, 28 cats were inoculated with approximately 100 (studies 1 and 2) or 40 (study 3) infective third stage D. immitis larvae by subcutaneous injection, thirty days prior to treatment. The larvae were from recent field isolates from naturally infected dogs from three distinct geographic areas (two in the USA and one in Europe). In each study, the cats were allocated randomly to two study groups of 14 cats each. The control group remained untreated. On Day 0, each cat in the treated group received one topical application of the novel topical formulation, delivering the minimum intended dose of 0.5mg of eprinomectin per kilogram of body weight. At 6 months after infection, all cats were humanely euthanized and examined for adult D. immitis. Across all three studies, 28 (68%) of the 41 untreated cats harbored one or more heartworms, while 100% of the 42 treated cats remained free of heartworm infection, demonstrating the 100% preventive efficacy of BROADLINE(®) against D. immitis in cats.

Cross-hybridization was not observed between the M. sexta cDNAs and S. frugiperda DNA and mRNA. Vitellogenin cDNA from M. sexta did not hybridize to L. dispar DNA or mRNA. However, the 834 bp microvitellogenin cDNA from M. sexta hybridized to an approximately 850 bp transcript in L. dispar mRNA. A 2.5 kb cDNA clone, pz64, was isolated from late last instar larvae of female L. dispar by differential screening. This clone has 38% amino acid sequence (deduced) and 55% nucleic acid sequence similarities with the 3'-end of high molecular  vitellogenin in Bombyx mori (silkworm). When used as a probe in northern analysis of L. dispar mRNA, this cDNA hybridized to a 5.3 kb transcript in female last instar larvae, pupae, and adults, but not to male last instar larvae and adults. This cDNA did not hybridize to mRNA from M. sexta or S. frugiperda. Expression of the 5.3 kb vitellogenin transcript hybridizing to the 2.5 kb cDNA clone was suppressed in 5-day-old last instar larvae of female L. dispar treated on day 2 with doses of the juvenile hormone analog, , greater than 10 nmol.

The first day of the study, the E. canis PCR were positive in 18 dogs (53%). A. platys was found in one dog and all dogs were negative for Babesia spp. After one month of doxycycline treatment, the number of PCR positive dogs decreased significantly to 2 (5.9%). During seven months, all dogs were treated monthly topically with a novel combination (Certifect(®), Merial) delivering at least 6.7 mg fipronil/kg , 8.0mg amitraz/kg and 6 mg (S)-/kg. The number of PCR positive dogs remained stable all over the seven months, with 4 dogs being positive at Day 90 and 2 at Day 210. The combination of treatment and monthly prevention had a significant effect in the two kennels. All dogs remained healthy, which was not the case in previous years.Copyright © 2013 The Authors.

Although considered as generally causing no or little harm, infection with urinary capillarids may be associated with clinical disease which requires an appropriate treatment including the use of anthelmintics. Therefore, the efficacy of a novel topical combination formulation of fipronil 8.3% (w/v), (S)- 10% (w/v), eprinomectin 0.4% (w/v), and praziquantel 8.3% (w/v) (BROADLINE(®), Merial) was evaluated against urinary capillarids in naturally infected cats. Sixteen European Short Hair cats (5 male, 11 female) with capillarid eggs in their urine pre-treatment were included in the study. At the time of treatment, the cats were approximately ten months to eight years old and weighed 1.6-3.6 kg. Cats were ranked based on decreasing bodyweight and then randomly allocated within replicates of two animals to one of the treatment groups.

The survival and reproduction rates of F. candida were evaluated after 28 days of exposure to six IGRs (, fenoxycarb, precocene II, tebufenozide, hexaflumuron and teflubenzuron) and to one herbicide (diuron) in artificial soil. The differences in the sensitivity of F. candida to these different substances are high. The chitin synthesis inhibitors teflubenzuron and hexaflumuron were the most toxic compounds with an EC50 of 0.05 mg/kg (dry ) for teflubenzuron and an EC50 of 0.6mg/kg for hexaflumuron. Teflubenzuron is toxic for F. candida at concentrations that are probably close to environmental levels of this insecticide. Inhibition of reproduction is strongly related to adult survival for the juvenile hormone agonist  and for the antijuvenile hormone precocene II, with an EC50 of 173 mg/kg and a LC50 of 178mg/kg for  and an EC50 of 15 mg/kg and a LC50 of 26 mg/kg for precocene II. Fenoxycarb, another juvenile hormone analog, showed a dose-response curve for mortality different from that of ; at concentrations such as 3052 mg/kg no effect on adult survival was observed. However, the EC50 value of 113mg/kg is of the same order of magnitude as that obtained for . A test with compressed soil contaminated with fenoxycarb was conducted to observe parameters such as numbers of eggs laid and juveniles hatched. No differences were observed between these two endpoints for fenoxycarb. An EC50 of 109 mg/kg was obtained for the ecdysone agonist tebufenozide. The herbicide diuron showed a relatively high toxicity for F. candida with an EC50 of 20 mg/kg.

Cats were selected based on a pre-treatment faecal examination indicating a patent infection with at least hookworms (two studies), Toxocara ascarids (one study), taeniid cestodes (two studies) or Dipylidium cestodes (two studies). In each study, cats were assigned randomly to blocks of two animals each, based on decreasing pre-treatment  and were randomly allocated to one of two groups of six to 12 cats: untreated (control) or treated with topical fipronil (8.3%, w/v), (S)- (10%, w/v), eprinomectin (0.4%, w/v) and praziquantel (8.3%, w/v) (BROADLINE(®), Merial) at 0.12 mL/kg  (providing a minimum of 10mg fipronil+12 mg S-+0.5mg eprinomectin+10mg praziquantel per kg ). The topical treatment was administered directly on the skin in the midline of the neck in a single spot once on Day 0. For parasite recovery and count, cats were euthanized humanely and necropsied seven or ten days after treatment. A single treatment with the novel topical combination product provided 91% efficacy against Ancylostoma braziliense, ≥ 99% efficacy against Ancylostoma tubaeforme, and >97% efficacy against Toxocara cati. Similarly, excellent efficacy was established against Taenia taeniaeformis, Dipylidium caninum and Diplopylidium spp. as demonstrated by >97% and up to 100% reductions of cestode counts in the treated cats when compared to the untreated controls (P<0.01). All cats accepted the treatment well based on health observations post-treatment and daily health observations. No adverse experiences or other health problems were observed throughout the studies. The results of this series of controlled studies demonstrated high efficacy and excellent acceptability of the novel topical combination formulation of fipronil, (S)-, eprinomectin and praziquantel against a broad range of feline intestinal nematode and cestode infections.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

The complete cDNA (2121bp) encodes a 706-amino acid protein with a molecular mass ~82kDa. Expression of RbHex 82 was predominant in fat body among larval tissues. Further, it is prominently expressed during the last instar larval development. Homology modeling and docking studies predicted riboflavin binding site of the hexamerin. Spectrofluorimetric analysis further confirmed riboflavin release from the hexamerin fraction. Quantitative RT-PCR studies demonstrated hormonal regulation of RbHex 82. 20-Hydroxyecdysone (20HE) had a stimulatory effect on its transcription whereas JH alone did not show any effect. However, JH in the presence of 20HE maintains the RbHex 82 expression which indicates the JH's role as a status quo factor.

Previously we have demonstrated that larval growth period influences the effect of insulin on the accumulation of glycogen in the fat body of Bombyx larvae. In the present study we demonstrate that Bombyx larvae at the terminal growth period (TGP, after critical weight) had a significantly greater increase in the expression level of Akt in the fat body than at the active growth period (AGP, before critical weight). The larvae at TGP also showed an increase in the expression level of ecdysone receptors (EcRB1 and USP1) and ecdysone-induced early genes (E75A and broad). The treatment of bovine insulin and  to larvae at AGP induced the transcript levels of Akt, irrespective of the nutritional status of the larvae. However, in larvae at TGP, insulin repressed the transcript level of Akt. On contrary, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) induced the expression level of Akt in TGP larvae, but at feeding only. Insulin and 20E thus showed an antagonistic action on the Akt expression level in TGP larvae under feeding. The studies thus showed that larval growth period influences the expression level of Akt and ecdysone receptors in Bombyx. Further, the growth period and nutrition modulate the effect of exogenous hormones on Akt expression.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Concerns include slow-release  formulations and its environmental breakdown products which mimic an endogenous crustacean hormone and retinoids, respectively. Our primary objective was to evaluate the effect that a chronic  exposure would have on male and female Uca pugnax limb regeneration and molting. After single limb autonomy, limb growth and molt stage were monitored every two days while eyestalk ablation was used to induce proecdysis.

However, little is known about how polyphenisms evolve in natural populations, the developmental mechanisms that may mediate such evolution, and the consequences of such modification for patterns of morphological variation. Here we examine the developmental mechanisms of polyphenism evolution in highly divergent natural populations of the dung beetle, Onthophagus taurus. Males of this species express two alternative morphologies in response to larval feeding conditions. Favorable conditions cause males to grow larger than a threshold body size and to develop a pair of horns on their heads. Males that encounter relatively poor conditions during larval life do not reach this threshold size and remain hornless. Exotic populations of O. taurus have diverged dramatically in body size thresholds in less than 40 years since introduction to new habitats, resulting in the expression of highly divergent and novel horn length-body size scaling relationships in these populations. Here we show that larvae of populations that have evolved a larger threshold body size (1) have to accumulate greater mass to become competent to express the horned morph, (2) require more time to complete the final instar, (3) are less sensitive to the juvenile hormone (JH) analogue , and (4) exhibit a delay in the sensitive period for  relative to other developmental events. JH has been shown previously to control horn expression in this species. Our results show that threshold evolution may be mediated via changes in the degree and timing of sensitivity to JH and may result in correlated changes in the dynamics and duration of larval development. Strain-specific differences in JH sensitivity have previously been demonstrated in other insects. However, to the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration that changes in the timing of the sensitive period for JH may play an equally important role in the evolution of novel thresholds. We discuss our findings in the context of the developmental regulatory mechanisms that underlie polyphenic development and use our results to explore the consequences of, and constraints on, polyphenism evolution in nature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7679110>Properties and sequence of a female-specific, juvenile hormone-induced protein from locust hemolymph.</a></h2><p>In the  body of Locusta migratoria, an RNA transcript of about 800 nucleotides has been detected that is specific to the adult female and dependent on induction by juvenile hormone (JH) or an analog. The corresponding cDNA has been cloned (lambda 21) and a 718-base pair sequence determined. It encodes a 196-amino acid polypeptide, including a signal peptide. An NH2-terminal sequence has 24 out of 28 amino acids identical with those of a previously described 19K locust hemolymph protein, but the remainder of the sequence shows no similarity. From adult female hemolymph, a 21-kDa protein, designated 21K protein, has been purified, with an NH2-terminal sequence exactly matching that deduced from clone lambda 21. This 21K protein is found only in the adult female, is dependent on induction by JH, and is assumed to represent the product of the lambda 21 gene. It shows no immunochemical cross-reaction with locust 19K protein, apolipophorin III, nor with vitellogenin (Vg). Its isoelectric point is pH 5.4; it contains some carbohydrate. 21K protein is synthesized in adult female  body, accumulates in hemolymph, and is taken up into the developing oocytes in parallel with Vg. In locusts deprived of JH with precocene, production of 21K protein and of lambda 21-hybridizing transcripts is induced by the JH analog, , in parallel with Vg and its mRNA. Because of its sex-, stage-, and JH-dependent regulation, coordinate with Vg, the 21K protein will be valuable for analysis of gene expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2105312>Evidence for a juvenile hormone receptor involved in protein synthesis in Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h2><p>The larval  body of newly eclosed adults of Drosophila melanogaster was found to contain a single major binding protein specific for juvenile hormone (JH). Binding to this protein was saturable, of high affinity, and specific for JH III. The protein has a subunit molecular weight (Mr) of 85,000, as determined by photoaffinity labeling. The same or similar JH-binding protein was found in larval  body and cuticle of third instar larvae and in male accessory glands and heads of newly eclosed adults. It was not found in several other tissues in adults. Male accessory gland cytosol from wild-type flies was found to contain a single binder with a dissociation constant (KD) of 6.7 nM for JH III; a binder in similar preparations from the -tolerant (Met) mutant had a KD value 6-fold higher. JH III stimulated protein synthesis in glands cultured in vitro, but this effect was reduced in Met flies as compared to wild-type flies, establishing a correlation between JH binding and biological activity of the hormone. In addition, glandular protein accumulation during the first 2 days of adult development was less in Met flies than in wild-type flies. These results strongly suggest that the binding protein we have identified mediates this JH effect in male accessory glands and thus is acting as a JH receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17683439>Juvenile hormone as a regulator of the trade-off between reproduction and life span in Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h2><p>Trade-offs between reproduction and life span are ubiquitous, but little is known about their underlying mechanisms. Here we combine treatment with the juvenile hormone analog (JHa)  and experimental evolution in Drosophila melanogaster to study the potential role of juvenile hormone (JH) in mediating such trade-offs at both the physiological and evolutionary level. Exposure to JHa in the larval medium (and up to 24 h posteclosion) increased early life fecundity but reduced life span of normal (unselected) flies, supporting the physiological role of JH in mediating the trade-off. This effect was much smaller for life span, and not detectable for fecundity, in fly lines previously bred for 19 generations on a medium containing JHa. Furthermore, these selection lines lived longer than unselected controls even in the absence of JHa treatment, without a detectable reduction in early life fecundity. Thus, selection for resistance to JHa apparently induced some evolutionary changes in JH metabolism or signaling, which led to longer life span as a correlated response. This supports the hypothesis that JH may mediate evolution of longer life span, but--contrary to our expectation-this apparently does not need to trade--off with fecundity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20688076>Total body nitrogen and total body carbon as indicators of body protein and body lipids in the melon fly Bactrocera cucurbitae: effects of , a juvenile hormone analogue, and of diet supplementation with hydrolyzed yeast.</a></h2><p>The application of , and providing access to diet including hydrolyzed yeast, are treatments known to enhance mating success in the male melon fly Bactrocera cucurbitae Coquillett (Diptera: Tephritidae), supporting their use in mass rearing protocols for sterile males in the context of sterile insect technique (SIT) programmes. The objective of the present laboratory study was to investigate the effect of  application and diet supplementation with hydrolyzed yeast (protein) on the turnover of body lipids and protein to confirm the feasibility of their application in melon fly SIT mass-rearing programmes. While females had access to a diet that included hydrolyzed yeast (protein), males were exposed to one of the following treatments: (1) topical application of  and access to diet including protein (M+P+); (2) only diet including protein (M-P+); (3) only  (M+P-) and (4) untreated, only sugar-fed, control males (M-P-). Total body carbon (TBC) and total body nitrogen (TBN) of flies were measured at regular intervals from emergence to 35 days of age for each of the different treatments. Nitrogen assimilation and turnover in the flies were measured using stable isotope ((15)N) dilution techniques. Hydrolyzed yeast incorporation into the diet significantly increased male body weight, TBC and TBN as compared to sugar-fed males. Females had significantly higher body weight, TBC and TBN as compared to all males. TBC and TBN showed age-dependent changes, increasing until the age of sexual maturity and decreasing afterwards in both sexes.  treatment did not significantly affect TBC or TBN. The progressive increase with age of TBC suggests that lipogenesis occurs in adult male B. cucurbitae, as is the case in other tephritids. Stable isotope dilution was shown to be an effective method for determining N uptake in B. cucurbitae. This technique was used to show that sugar-fed males rely solely on larval N reserves and that the N uptake rate in males with access to diet including hydrolyzed yeast was higher shortly after emergence and then stabilized. The implications of the results for SIT applications are discussed.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To investigate these inter-relationships in female burying beetles (Nicrophorus spp.), we examined the effect of diet quality on juvenile hormone (JH) levels and reproduction, and the effect of JH supplementation on reproduction and resistance to starvation. Nicrophorus orbicollis adult females fed a less preferred mealworm larvae diet gained less  mass, had smaller ovaries and had lower titers of JH in their hemolymph than females fed a preferred blowfly diet. When presented a carcass for breeding, females on a less preferred diet oviposited 33% fewer eggs, and eggs were of 18% less mass. Females on the less preferred diet also took longer to begin oviposition as indicated indirectly by the time when their eggs hatched. To investigate the effects of JH, independent of nutrition, JH was topically applied to single and paired females of Nicrophorus tomentosus. When presented a carcass, JH-treated paired females oviposited more eggs (28%-year 1, 44%-year 2) than control females, and also showed a trend toward faster oviposition. JH supplementation had a greater effect on single females. JH treatment increased the proportion of single females attempting reproduction (at least one viable larva), increased the number of eggs (69%-year 1, 123%-year 2), and increased the proportion of females ovipositing early. In separate experiments, treatment with JH or a JH analog negatively affected resistance to starvation in three species. Treatment with JH reduced starvation survival by 10.3% days in N. tomentosus females. Treatment with the JH analog  reduced starvation survival 17.8% in N. orbicollis females and by 18% in Ptomascopus morio females. These results suggest that JH has positive and negative effects on different components of life history.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8016136>A nuclear juvenile hormone-binding protein from larvae of Manduca sexta: a putative receptor for the metamorphic action of juvenile hormone.</a></h2><p>A 29-kDa nuclear juvenile hormone (JH)-binding protein from the epidermis of Manduca sexta larvae was purified by using the photoaffinity analog for JH II ([3H]epoxyhomofarnesyldiazoacetate) and partially sequenced. A 1.1-kb cDNA was isolated by using degenerate oligonucleotide primers for PCR based on these sequences. The cDNA encoded a 262-amino acid protein that showed no similarity with other known proteins, except for short stretches of the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, rhodopsin, and human nuclear protein p68. Recombinant baculovirus containing this cDNA made a 29-kDa protein that was covalently modified by [3H]epoxyhomofarnesyldiazoacetate and specifically bound the natural enantiomer of JH I (Kd = 10.7 nM). This binding was inhibited by the natural JHs but not by . Immunocytochemical analysis showed localization of this 29-kDa protein to epidermal nuclei. Both mRNA and protein are present during the intermolt periods; during the larval molt, the mRNA disappears but the protein persists. Later when cells become pupally committed, both the mRNA and protein disappear with a transient reappearance near pupal ecdysis. The properties of this protein are consistent with its being the receptor necessary for the antimetamorphic effects of JH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20185241>Efficacy of the fipronil 10%+(S)- 9% combination against Rhipicephalus sanguineus in naturally infested dogs: speed of kill, persistent efficacy on immature and adult stages and effect of water.</a></h2><p>This field trial was designed to test the efficacy, in terms of treatment and prevention, of the fipronil 10%+(S)- 9% combination against immature and adult stages of Rhipicephalus sanguineus in naturally infested dogs, and to assess the effect of a single plain water exposure. Twenty-four dogs of various age, sex, weight and coat length were divided into two homogeneous groups, treated (T) and control (C), and housed into twin outdoor kennels. Trial baseline was designed as day 0, when dogs from group T were treated with a commercial spot-on formulation of fipronil 10%+(S)- 9%, while subjects from group C were left untreated and served as control. After treatment, tick load for each included dog was estimated, for both adult and immature ticks, using the localization and count over the entire body surface at the following time-points: day 2, to evaluate the speed of kill and at days 7, 14, 21 and 28 to assess the persistence of efficacy. The effect of water exposure on the product efficacy was tested at day 14 of the study, when six dogs, homogenously selected from group T, were soaked through with plain water. The overall tick load in dogs from group C was high throughout the entire study period, ranging from 103.2 (day 28) to 161.3 (day 0), and confirmed the high tick pressure. Speed of kill calculated at 48 h post-treatment was slightly higher for adult ticks (96.2%) than for immature stages (91.6%). Compared to the control, dogs treated with the fipronil+(S)- maintained a significantly lower mean tick load for both adult and immature stages in the four weeks of observation. Persistence of efficacy against immature stages ranged from 97.1% the first week, 99.6% second week, 99.7 third week and 93.1% in the last week. In the same way, efficacy against adult ticks was constantly high, shifting from 94.5% to 92.5%. Overall efficacy (adults+immatures) was the strongest in the first two weeks (i.e., 96.1% and 96.6%) and lowered in the two remaining weeks (i.e., 94.2% and 93.4%). Results showed that water exposure did not affect the activity and persistence of the tested combination. On the basis of this field trial, the fipronil+(S)- combination represents a highly efficacious product to control all stages of R. sanguineus ticks on dogs.(c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

On the final day of feeding (Day 3) before the onset of metamorphosis many endocuticular proteins were no longer synthesized and new isoelectric variants of 27,000-Da polypeptides were deposited into the cuticle coincident with the formation of lamellae 5- to 10-fold thinner than those previously deposited.

Starvation experiments indicate that the Aedes aegypti critical weight is achieved by 24 h after the last larval-larval molt. When grown at 24 degrees C with excess food, the time between the critical weight and maximum weight (interval to cessation of growth) is about 24 h and pupation occurs about 24 h after the maximum weight is achieved. Oil Red O staining of 3rd and early 4th instars indicates that the midgut is a neutral  storage organ during this period. Coincident with the attainment of the critical weight is the depletion of stored midgut neutral . Application of  to 24 h post-molt 4th instars results in renewed midgut storage of neutral  suggesting that midgut neutral  storage is a JH dependent process. Starvation of 4th instars during the 24 h post-molt period suspends development in a fraction of the larvae, and with the resumption of feeding, development resumes. A regimen of starvation and resumption of feeding of 4th instars suggests that JH concentration decreased over a 40 h period after the resumption of feeding and maximum weight is attained about 48 h after the resumption of feeding. We hypothesize that this results in a shortening of the interval to cessation of growth. Real-time PCR experiments indicate that shortening the interval to cessation of growth compresses the time period during which increases in AHR3, AaEcR-B and AaUSP-a expression occur.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29680288>Involvement of -tolerant (Met) in the determination of the final  size in Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) larvae.</a></h2><p>In the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta, juvenile hormone (JH) is critical for the control of species-specific size. However, whether the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim domain receptor -tolerant (Met) is involved remains unconfirmed. In the present paper, we found that RNA interference (RNAi)-aided knockdown of Met gene (LdMet) lowered the larval and pupal fresh  and shortened the larval development period in the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata. Dietary introduction of JH into the LdMet RNAi larvae rescued neither the decreased  nor the reduced development phase, even though JH ingestion by control larvae extended developmental time and caused large pupae. Moreover, the transcript levels of five genes involved in prothoracicotropic hormone and cap 'n' collar isoform C/Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 pathways were upregulated in the LdMet silenced larvae. Ecdysteroidogenesis was thereby activated; 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) titer was increased; and 20E signaling pathway was elicited in the LdMet RNAi larvae. Therefore, JH, acting through its receptor Met, inhibits PTTH production and release before the attainment of critical . Once the critical  is reached, JH production and release are averted; and the hemolymph JH is removed. The elimination of JH allows the brain to release PTTH. PTTH subsequently stimulates ecdysteroid biosynthesis and release to start larval-pupal transition in L. decemlineata.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The fitness cost of resistance in target pests is regarded as one of the main factors delaying resistance when adopting the refuge strategy. In this study, we compared the life-history traits of three independent sets of Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner, 1809) adults, of each there were a susceptible population and a Cry1Ac-resistant population derived by selection from it. Confirming to the previous studies, resistant individuals exhibited fewer progeny, less fecundity, lower egg hatching rate, and longer adult longevity. And poor fecundity in resistant strains was associated with the decline of the mature follicular amount, the ovarian weight ratio, and the length of the longest ovarian tubule. Interestingly, the juvenile hormone (JH) level appeared higher in resistant strains relative to susceptible strains. Application of  (JH analogue) in vivo was effective in reducing fecundity and hatchability with the up-regulation of detected JH titer. These results suggested that resistance against Bt toxin reduced the reproductive capacity of H. armigera, and JH level is affected in the tradeoff between reproductive capacity and Bt resistance.© Crown copyright 2016.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22929589>Effect of juvenile hormone analog,  on H-fibroin regulation during the last instar larval development of Corcyra cephalonica.</a></h2><p>Juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), co-ordinately orchestrate insect growth and development. The process of silk synthesis and secretion in lepidopteran insects is known to be under hormonal control. However, the role of JH in this process has not been demonstrated hitherto. The present study is aimed to elucidate the role of JH in H-fibroin regulation in Corcyra cephalonica, a serious lepidopteran pest. Reiterated amino acid stretches and the large molecular  of H-fibroin render its cloning and characterization cumbersome. To address this, a commercially synthesized short amino acid peptide conjugated with a carrier protein was used to generate antibodies against the N-terminal region of H-fibroin. ELISA and immunoblot experiments demonstrated the sensitivity and specificity of antibody. Further, immunohistochemical analyses revealed the antibody's cross-reactivity with H-fibroins of C. cephalonica and Bombyx mori in the silk gland lumen. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated the tissue-specificity and developmental expression of H-fibroin. Hormonal studies revealed that JH alone does not alter the expression of H-fibroin. However, in the presence 20E, JH reverses the declined expression caused by 20E administration to normal levels. This study provides molecular evidence for the regulation of H-fibroin by the cumulative action of JH and 20E.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

After completing metamorphosis, young workers have low titers of juvenile hormone and spend the first several weeks of their adult lives performing tasks within the hive. Older workers, approximately 3 weeks of age, have high titers of juvenile hormone and forage outside the hive for nectar and pollen. We have previously reported that changes in the volume of the mushroom bodies of the honey bee brain are temporally associated with the performance of foraging. The neuropil of the mushroom bodies is increased in volume, whereas the volume occupied by the somata of the Kenyon cells is significantly decreased in foragers relative to younger workers. To study the effect of flight experience and juvenile hormone on these changes within the mushroom bodies, young worker bees were treated with the juvenile hormone analog  but a subset was prevented from foraging (big back bees). Stereological volume estimates revealed that, regardless of foraging experience, bees treated with  had a significantly larger volume of neuropil in the mushroom bodies and a significantly smaller Kenyon cell somal region volume than did 1-day-old bees. The bees treated with  did not differ on these volume estimates from untreated foragers (presumed to have high endogenous levels of juvenile hormone) of the same age sampled from the same colony. Bees prevented from flying and foraging nonetheless received visual stimulation as they gathered at the hive entrance. These results, coupled with a subregional analysis of the neuropil, suggest a potentially important role of visual stimulation, possibly interacting with juvenile hormone, as an organizer of the mushroom bodies. In an independent study, the brains of worker bees in which the transition to foraging was delayed (overaged nurse bees) were also studied. The mushroom bodies of overaged nurse bees had a Kenyon cell somal region volume typical of normal aged nurse bees. However, they displayed a significantly expanded neuropil relative to normal aged nurse bees. Analysis of the big back bees demonstrates that certain aspects of adult brain plasticity associated with foraging can be displayed by worker bees treated with  independent of foraging experience. Analysis of the overaged nurse bees suggests that the post-metamorphic expansion of the neuropil of the mushroom bodies of worker honey bees is not a result of foraging experience.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15482895>Efficacy of fipronil/(S)- combination spot-on for dogs against shed eggs, emerging and existing adult cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis, Bouché).</a></h2><p>The inhibitory activities of fipronil (10% (w/v) solution), (S)- (9% (w/v) solution), and fipronil/(S)- (10 and 9% (w/v) solution, respectively) combination against eggs and emerging adult cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) and adulticidal activity were tested on experimentally infested dogs. Thirty-two Beagle dogs were selected for this study and eight replicates of four animals were formed based on  within sex. One dog in each replicate was randomly allocated to treatment with: (1) untreated control; (2) fipronil 10% (w/v) solution, (3) (S)- 9% (w/v) solution, and (4) fipronil 10% (w/v) and (S)- 9% (w/v) combination solution. Treatments were applied once topically on Day 0 at the rate of 0.067 ml/kg. On Days -12, -1, 21, and weekly to Day 84 each dog was infested with approximately 200 fleas and comb counted approximately 24h later, or 2 days (our 48 h) after in the case of Day -1 infestation. On Days -11, 1, 22, and weekly to Day 85 each dog was again infested with approximately 200 fleas. Flea eggs were collected over approximately 24 h beginning 3 days after infestation. Fleas were combed off of the dogs and counted at the end of the egg collection period (approximately 96 h count). One aliquot of up to about 100 eggs, if available, from each animal at each infestation time was incubated for approximately 72 h to determine larval hatch and the other for 35 days to determine the number of adults that developed. The 10% (w/v) fipronil spot-on provided excellent control (>95%) of adult fleas on dogs for 5 weeks. Similarly, the combination spot-on of 10% (w/v) fipronil and 9% (w/v) (S)- provided excellent control of adult fleas, i.e., >95% for 5 weeks. From week 6 post-treatment onward, the relatively low inhibition of adult flea emergence substantiated the lack of significant ovicidal/larvicidal activity in the fipronil (10%, w/v) treatment group. However, the combination product provided excellent (>90%) ovicidal activity for 8 weeks and high (91.4%) inhibition of adult flea emergence for 12 weeks. In addition, a synergistic effect of the two compounds in combination was demonstrated with fipronil enhancing the ovicidal and inhibition of adult flea emergence activity of (S)- against cat flea eggs. When all stages of the life cycle of the cat flea are considered, the combination spot-on product provided a high level of total flea control yielding a curative effect against adult fleas and inhibition of flea development stages with little to no potential reinfestation pressure on the animal or in the environment for 12 weeks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703069>Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of eprinomectin in cats when administered in a novel topical combination of fipronil, (S)-, eprinomectin and praziquantel.</a></h2><p>Four studies were conducted to determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics and in vitro metabolism of eprinomectin, a semi-synthetic avermectin, in cats. Pharmacokinetic parameters including bioavailability of eprinomectin were determined in a parallel study design comprised of one group of eight cats which were treated once topically at 0.12 mL/kg bodyweight with BROADLINE(®), a novel combination product (fipronil 8.3% (w/v), (S)- 10% (w/v), eprinomectin 0.4% (w/v) and praziquantel 8.3% (w/v)), delivering a dose of 0.5mg eprinomectin per kg , and a group of six cats which received 0.4% (w/v) eprinomectin at 0.4 mg/kg bodyweight once by intravenous injection. For cats treated by topical application, the average eprinomectin (B1a component) maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 20 ng/mL. The maximum concentrations were reached 24h after dosing in the majority of the animals (six of eight cats). The average terminal half-life was 114 h due to slow absorption ('flip-flop' kinetics). Following intravenous administration the average Cmax was 503 ng/mL at 5 min post-dose, and the mean elimination half-life was 23 h. Eprinomectin was widely distributed with a mean volume of distribution of 2,390 mL/kg, and the clearance rate was 81 mL/h/kg. Mean areas under the plasma concentration versus time curves extrapolated to infinity were 2,100 ngh/mL and 5,160 ngh/mL for the topical and intravenous doses, respectively. Topical eprinomectin was absorbed with an average absolute bioavailability of 31%. In a second parallel design study, the dose proportionality of eprinomectin after single topical administration of BROADLINE(®) was studied. Four groups of eight cats each were treated once topically with 0.5, 1, 2 or 5 times the minimum recommended dose of the combination, 0.12 mL/kg bodyweight. Based on comparison of areas under the plasma concentration versus time curves from the time of dosing to the last time point at which eprinomectin B1a was quantified, and Cmax, dose proportionality was established. In addition, the metabolic pathway of eprinomectin using cat liver microsomes, and plasma protein binding using cat, rat, and dog plasma were studied in vitro. Results of the analyses of eprinomectin B1a described here showed that it is metabolically stable and highly protein bound (>99%), and thus likely to be, as with other species, excreted mainly as unchanged parent drug in the feces of cats.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

In Lepidoptera which major agricultural pests belong to, JH signaling is critically controlled by a species-specific high-affinity, low molecular  JH-binding protein (JHBP) in hemolymph, which transports JH from the site of its synthesis to target tissues. Hence, JHBP is expected to be an excellent target for the development of novel specific insect growth regulators (IGRs) and insecticides. A better understanding of the structural biology of JHBP should pave the way for the structure-based drug design of such compounds. Here, we report the crystal structure of the silkworm Bombyx mori JHBP in complex with two molecules of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), one molecule (MPD1) bound in the JH-binding pocket while the other (MPD2) in a second cavity. Detailed comparison with the apo-JHBP and JHBP-JH II complex structures previously reported by us led to a number of intriguing findings. First, the JH-binding pocket changes its size in a ligand-dependent manner due to flexibility of the gate α1 helix. Second, MPD1 mimics interactions of the epoxide moiety of JH previously observed in the JHBP-JH complex, and MPD can compete with JH in binding to the JH-binding pocket. We also confirmed that , which has an MPD-like structure, inhibits the complex formation between JHBP and JH while the unepoxydated JH III (methyl farnesoate) does not. These findings may open the door to the development of novel IGRs targeted against JHBP. Third, binding of MPD to the second cavity of JHBP induces significant conformational changes accompanied with a cavity expansion. This finding, together with MPD2-JHBP interaction mechanism identified in the JHBP-MPD complex, should provide important guidance in the search for the natural ligand of the second cavity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531857>Interactive effects of mosquito control insecticide toxicity, hypoxia, and increased carbon dioxide on larval and juvenile eastern oysters and hard clams.</a></h2><p>Mosquito control insecticide use in the coastal zone coincides with the habitat and mariculture operations of commercially and ecologically important shellfish species. Few data are available regarding insecticide toxicity to shellfish early life stages, and potential interactions with abiotic stressors, such as low oxygen and increased CO2 (low pH), are less understood. Toxicity was assessed at 4 and 21 days for larval and juvenile stages of the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, and the hard clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, using two pyrethroids (resmethrin and permethrin), an organophosphate (naled), and a juvenile growth hormone mimic (). Acute toxicity (4-day LC50) values ranged from 1.59 to >10 mg/L. Overall, clams were more susceptible to mosquito control insecticides than oysters. Naled was the most toxic compound in oyster larvae, whereas resmethrin was the most toxic compound in clam larvae. Mortality for both species generally increased with chronic insecticide exposure (21-day LC50 values ranged from 0.60 to 9.49 mg/L). Insecticide exposure also caused sublethal effects, including decreased swimming activity after 4 days in larval oysters (4-day EC50 values of 0.60 to 2.33 mg/L) and decreased growth (shell area and ) in juvenile clams and oysters after 21 days (detected at concentrations ranging from 0.625 to 10 mg/L). Hypoxia, hypercapnia, and a combination of hypoxia and hypercapnia caused mortality in larval clams and increased resmethrin toxicity. These data will benefit both shellfish mariculture operations and environmental resource agencies as they manage the use of mosquito control insecticides near coastal ecosystems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17875330>Imposex induction is mediated through the Retinoid X Receptor signalling pathway in the neogastropod Nucella lapillus.</a></h2><p>The imposex phenomenon in female prosobranch gastropods provides one of the best documented examples of endocrine disruption in wildlife. While many field studies have demonstrated the negative impact of tributyltin (TBT) upon female gastropods, the mechanism(s) underlying imposex development has not yet been fully clarified. Over the years several hypotheses have been raised to determine the biochemical and molecular determinants of this process. Nevertheless, the interplay between the different suggested pathways (neuroendocrine, steroid and retinoid) is still unknown. Hence, through a combination of exposure experiments, we show that the 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cisRA), the proposed natural ligand of the retinoic X receptor (RXR), induces imposex in females of Nucella lapillus to the same degree as tributyltin, when administered at similar concentrations (1 microg/g ).  acid, a selective ligand for RXR, also induces imposex, albeit to a lower degree than that of the positive control. In contrast, testosterone significantly induced imposex, but had no effect on female penis induction, while the neuropeptide APGWamide had no effect on imposex development. These results clearly demonstrate that imposex induction in N. lapillus is mediated through the modulation of the RXR signalling pathways. In addition to the effects reported in female dogwhelks, both TBT and RA significantly increased male penis length, thus suggesting that TBT may also impact male secondary sex organs through the RXR signalling pathways. As a step for future studies, we have cloned the orthologue of N. lapillus RXR and provide experimental evidence that it binds 9cisRA. Finally, the basal expression level of RXR in several tissues of N. lapillus was determined through real-time PCR, thus showing that RXR is ubiquitously expressed in mollusc tissues, with the highest expression levels being recorded in female and male gonads. The mechanistic impacts of the overall findings to the imposex process are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17118399>Programmed cell death in flight muscle histolysis of the house cricket.</a></h2><p>We have characterized the process of flight muscle histolysis in the female house cricket, Acheta domesticus, through analysis of alterations of tissue wet weight, total protein content, and percent shortening of the dorsal longitudinal flight muscles (DLMs). Our objectives were to (1) define the normal course of histolysis in the cricket, (2) analyze the effects of juvenile hormone (JH) removal and replacement, (3) determine the effects of cycloheximide treatment, and (4) examine patterns of protein expression during histolysis. Our results suggest that flight muscle histolysis in the house cricket is an example of an active, developmentally regulated cell death program induced by an endocrine signal. Initial declines of total protein in DLMs indicated the JH signal that induced histolysis occurred by Day 2 and that histolysis was essentially complete by Day 3. Significant reductions in tissue weight and percent muscle shortening were observed in DLMs from Day 3 crickets. Cervical ligation of Day 1 crickets prevented histolysis but this inhibition could be reversed by continual topical treatments with  (an active JH analog) although ligation of Day 2 crickets did not prevent histolysis. A requirement for active protein expression was demonstrated by analysis of synthesis block by cycloheximide and short-term incorporation of (35)S-methionine.

Altosid XR briquets were weighed before and after 6-18 months of exposure in temporary wetlands to determine the rate of physical degradation of the briquets. Degradation rate was influenced mainly by the number of days a briquet remained under water. The average briquet degraded to 19% of its weight within 150 days of immersion and was completely degraded after 1.5 yr under water. The active ingredient () content of briquets declined faster among those exposed to air and more slowly among those that were immersed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15683831>Chitinase activity in the epidermis of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, as an in vivo screen for molt-interfering xenobiotics.</a></h2><p>We describe an in vivo screening assay that uses epidermal chitinase activity as the endpoint following a 7-day exposure of Uca pugilator to test chemicals. Chitinase, a chitinolytic enzyme, is the end product of endocrine cascades of a multi-hormonal system for control of crustacean molting. Wherever a molt-interfering agent adversely impacts the Y-organ-ecdysteroid receptor axis, the effect should be manifested by the activity of chitinase in the epidermis. Therefore, epidermal chitinase activity is an ideal endpoint for molt-interfering effects of xenobiotics. The validity of epidermal chitinase activity being used for such a purpose is supported by our finding that two injections of 20-hydroxyecdysone at 25 microg/g live  induced a twofold increase in chitinase activity in the epidermis of U. pugilator. A total of nine chemicals were screened for molting hormone and anti-molting activities. o,p'-DDT was found to significantly inhibit epidermal chitinase activity while kepone and methoxychlor exhibited a tendency of inhibition of enzymatic activity. None of the remaining six chemicals, namely, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT), atrazine, tributyltin (TBT), , dieldrin and permethrin, had an effect on epidermal chitinase activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1343777>Characterization of a cDNA clone encoding a glycine-rich cuticular protein of Tenebrio molitor: developmental expression and effect of a juvenile hormone analogue.</a></h2><p>The complete sequence of a cDNA clone, isolated from epidermal mRNA of Tenebrio molitor using a monoclonal antibody raised against an adult-specific cuticular antigen only present in the hard cuticle, was obtained after primer extension at the 5' end. From this cDNA sequence, the deduced protein encompasses 199 amino acids (including a signal peptide) with a total molecular weight of 20.7 kDa. The protein exhibits a bipartite structure: glycine-rich region located in its NH2-terminal part and a carboxy-terminal domain sharing homologies with other cuticular proteins of Orthoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera. In-situ hybridization analysis shows that the corresponding mRNA is present only in epidermal cells secreting the adult fibrous cuticle destined to become heavily sclerotized. In supernumerary pupae obtained after the application of the juvenile hormone analogue (JHA) to newly ecdysed pupae, the mRNA was undetectable, indicating that JHA can prevent the switch to the adult programme. However, in pupal-adult intermediates, obtained when JHA is applied later, the mRNA is detected.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15893431>Efficacy of a combination of imidacloprid 10%/permethrin 50% versus fipronil 10%/(S)- 12%, against ticks in naturally infected dogs.</a></h2><p>Preventing tick bites is a fundamental step towards reducing the impact of tick-borne protozoal, bacterial and viral diseases (TBDs) in humans and animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of imidacloprid 10%/permethrin 50% and of fipronil 10%/S- 12% against ticks in naturally infected dogs and to assess methodological parameters to calculate drug efficacy on tick immature stages. From July to August 2004, 45 privately owned dogs of various sexes, ages, breeds, coat length and habits were enrolled in a trial carried out in an area (radius approximately 50km) in Southern Italy. Three homogeneous groups (both for dog population and tick population) were formed: 15 dogs treated with imidacloprid 10% and permethrin 50% spot-on (group A), 15 dogs treated with fipronil 10% and  12% spot-on (group B) and 15 untreated dogs (group C). The dogs in each group were then sub-grouped according to their age and . Two different treatments were administered (time 0 and +28 days) to groups A and B, and the dogs were checked weekly for tick infestation until day +56 post-treatment (p.t.). Twenty-four areas distributed on the whole  surface were examined for ticks at each follow-up, while only at time 0 and at day +56 p.t., ticks were collected from the dogs and identified. For the immature stages a semi-quantitative method was adopted and the load of immature stages was evaluated and grouped into four classes up to day +56 p.t. when the mean number of immature ticks (MIT) for each infection class was evaluated. All the adult ticks collected were identified as brown dog ticks (Rhipicephalus sanguineus). Immature stages were first compared at day +28 p.t.. The efficacy of both products used in groups A and B on adult ticks was high and generally very similar. Conversely, the efficacy of imidacloprid 10% and permethrin 50% against immatures was higher than that of fipronil 10% and  12% throughout the observation period with statistically significant differences (p<0.05) at day +28 p.t. (i.e. group A=98.52%, group B=72.40%). On the whole, in analysing the efficacy of both products against adult plus immature ticks, it was found that the combination of imidacloprid 10% and permethrin 50% was more effective than fipronil 10% and  12%, with the differences being statistically significant at day +28 p.t. (group A=98.43%, group B=77.56%).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727669>Ecdysone differentially regulates metamorphic timing relative to 20-hydroxyecdysone by antagonizing juvenile hormone in Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h2><p>In insects, a steroid hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), plays important roles in the regulation of developmental transitions by initiating signaling cascades via the ecdysone receptor (EcR). Although 20E has been well characterized as the molting hormone, its precursor ecdysone (E) has been considered to be a relatively inactive compound because it has little or no effect on classic EcR mediated responses. I found that feeding E to wild-type third instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster accelerates the metamorphic timing, which results in elevation of lethality during metamorphosis and reduced body size, while 20E has only a minor effect. The addition of a juvenile hormone analog (JHA) to E impeded their precocious pupariation and thereby rescued the reduced body size. The ability of JHA impeding the effect of E was not observed in the -tolerant (Met) and germ-cell expressed (gce) double mutant animals lacking JH signaling, indicating that antagonistic action of JH against E is transduced via a primary JH receptor, Met, or a product of its homolog, Gce. I also found that L3 larvae are susceptible to E around the time when they reach their minimum viable weight. These results indicate that E, and not just 20E, is also essential for proper regulation of developmental timing and body size. Furthermore, the precocious pupariation triggered by E is impeded by the action of JH to ensure that animals attain body size to survive metamorphosis.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

For that purpose, fleas from different colonies from North America, Germany and South Africa were used to induce infestations in cats under laboratory conditions. In each study, between 12 and 16 cats were allocated randomly to 2 groups. Cats in Group 1 were not treated and served as controls. Cats in Group 2 were treated once on Day 0 with BROADLINE(®) at the minimum recommended dosage of 0.12 mg/kg body weight. In 4 studies, all animals were infested experimentally with unfed C. felis (100 ± 5) on Days 2 (or 1), 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. Live fleas were counted 24h post-treatment or infestation. In 2 additional studies, animals were infested at the same frequency with gravid C. felis fleas (100 ± 5) that were fed previously on an untreated host. Forty-eight hours post-infestation, flea eggs were collected, counted and incubated for the evaluation of the reduction of emergence of adults. The combined curative efficacy against adult fleas at 24h after treatment was 94.3% and the combined preventive efficacy values remained greater than 95.9% at 24h after 5 subsequent weekly infestations. In addition, the product reduced dramatically the emergence of new adult fleas for at least 5 weeks (>98.1% for one month and 93.2% at 5 weeks after infestation), demonstrating its efficiency in preventing environmental contamination by immature stages.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

To evaluate the efficacy of Broadline (Merial), a combination of fipronil 8.3% w/v, (S)- 10% w/v, eprinomectin 0.4% w/v and praziquantel 8.3% w/v against C. aerophila, a controlled study with 20 naturally infected cats was conducted. Following blocking by body weight, cats were allocated randomly to two groups of ten animals each: control (untreated) or treated once with Broadline according to the label instructions. For evaluation of efficacy, faeces were examined for capillarid egg shedding prior to and weekly for 3 weeks after treatment, when the cats were necropsied for C. aerophila recovery. Following single topical administration of Broadline, faecal capillarid egg counts were significantly reduced by 93.5 to 99.1% (p < 0.01) compared to the controls. Cats treated harboured significantly fewer C. aerophila lungworms compared to the untreated controls (efficacy 82.4%, p = 0.016). Results of this study demonstrate that Capillaria lungworm burdens can be markedly reduced and that faecal egg shedding can be substantially lowered or eliminated following a single treatment with Broadline.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3770309>Developmental expression of three genes for larval cuticular proteins of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta.</a></h2><p>Three cDNA clones coding for the 12.8, 13.3, and 14.6 kDa larval cuticular proteins of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, were isolated and characterized. Hybridization to abdominal epidermal RNA from different stages showed that the genes for the 12.8 and 13.3 kDa proteins were expressed only during larval life. By contrast, the gene for the 14.6 kDa protein was expressed throughout the segment during the feeding, growing larval stages, then only in the flexible intersegmental regions during the deposition of endocuticle in the pharate pupa and adult. Quantitative RNA dot blot hybridizations showed that the RNA for each protein disappeared during the larval molt when the ecdysteroid titer was high, then reappeared during the preecdysial deposition of endocuticle. All disappeared when the epidermis became pupally committed at the onset of wandering. Exposure of the fourth instar epidermis to 20-hydroxyecdysone (20HE) in vitro under conditions that lead to the formation of a new larval cuticle by 48 hr caused the disappearance of these RNAs by 18 hr. Exposure of Day 2 fifth instar epidermis to 20HE in vitro caused a depression of these RNAs which in the case of the RNAs coding for the 12.8 and 13.3 kDa proteins was partially prevented by simultaneous exposure to , a juvenile hormone (JH) mimic. By contrast, the RNA for the 14.6 kDa protein was suppressed by exposure to  alone. Thus, each of these larval cuticular genes is turned off by high ecdysteroid; the presence or absence of JH determines whether or not this suppression is permanent in some or all cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12173294>Purification and characterization of biliverdin-binding vitellogenin from the hemolymph of the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura.</a></h2><p>Biliverdin-binding vitellogenin (Vg) was purified from adult female hemolymph of the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura, by using gel filtration and ion exchange chromatographies. The molecular mass of the protein was 490 kDa and it was composed of two 188-kDa subunits. Three internal amino acid sequences obtained by digestion of the protein with lysylendopeptidase showed high similarity to those of Bombyx mori Vg, supporting the purified blue protein to be vitellogenin. latroscan analyses demonstrated the presence of biliverdin in Vg that occupied 2.4% of total  components. Among the lipids of Vg (9.5 micrograms total lipids per 100 micrograms protein), diacylglycerol was the most predominant, followed by phospholipid, hydrocarbons, and then triacylglycerol, while in biliverdin-binding proteins (BPs) purified from larval hemolymph (3.1 micrograms total lipids per 100 micrograms protein), phospholipid was the most abundant  followed by diacylglycerol; hydrocarbons and triacylglycerol were minor components. Vg was first detected in the hemolymph of female pupae one day before eclosion, but injection of 5 micrograms of  into a 3-day-old pupa induced Vg in the hemolymph 4 days earlier than in the control.  also induced a faster decline in BP-A and BP-B titers in the hemolymph with a corresponding increase of the Vg titer. These results suggest that juvenile hormone (JH) induces not only vitellogenesis but also the uptake of these proteins by stimulating the metamorphosis of  body during the pupal stage.</p></html>
