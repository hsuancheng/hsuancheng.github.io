Nicolson (Araceae), commonly called Suran or Jimmikand, has high medicinal value and is used ethnomedicinally for the treatment of different gastrointestinal and inflammatory disorders.The present study evaluated the effects of extracts of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius tubers on acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats.Wistar rats were orally administered methanol extract (APME) or aqueous extract (APAE) (250 and 500 mg/kg) or standard drug, prednisolone (PRDS) (4 mg/kg) for 7 days. On 6th day of treatment, UC was induced by transrectal instillation of 4% acetic acid (AA) and after 48 h colitis was assessed by measuring colitis parameters, biochemical estimations and histology of colon.APME or APAE pretreatment significantly (p < .05-.001) prevented AA-induced reduction in  and increase in colitis parameters viz. stool consistency, colon /length ratio and ulcer score, area and index. Extracts treatment attenuated (p < .001) increase in alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase in serum and myeloperoxidase activity and cytokines in colon tissue due to AA administration. Extracts treatment prevented AA-induced elevation in lipid peroxidation and decline in activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase and reduced-glutathione content (p < .05-.001) along with histopathological alterations. PRDS also showed similar ameliorative effect on colitis.APME and APAE showed a preventive effect on UC, and ameliorated inflammation and oxidative damage in colon. The effects may be attributed to presence of phytochemicals, , β-sitosterol, and glucomannan. In conclusion, the tuber of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius exhibited an anticolitic effect through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30520575>Comparison of Different Strains of Agrobacterium rhizogenes for Hairy Root Induction and Betulin and  Production in Morus alba.</a></h2><p>Three Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains were tested for their ability to transform the plant Mois alba L. and to induce production of the secondary metabolites betulin and . All the tested strains of A. rhizogenes (R1601, LBA9402 and R1000) were able to induce hairy root formation in leaf tissue explants. Strain LBA9402 had the highest rate of infection (92.7% ± 8.8%), whereas strain R1601 had the lowest rate (87.4% ± 9.3%). The highest number of hairy roots per explant (5.6 ±0.5) and the greatest root length (2.4 ± 0.2 mm) were obtained with strain LBA9402. We also evaluated dry weight (a measure of growth) and betulin and  production in hairy roots and found that the highest growth (167.8 ± 14.5 mg/flask) occurred after infection with strain LBA9402. Furthermore the highest production of betulin (5.4 ± 0.4 mg/g dry weight) and  (2.3 ± 0.2 mg/g dry weight) was noted using strain LBA9402. Among three elicitors, yeast extract showed the highest induction of betulin production (8.7 ± 0.4 mg/g) and silver nitrate induced the highest yield of  (4.1 ± 0.2 mg/g). Our study showed that A. rhizogenes strain LBA9402 was the most effective of the three tested strains for production-of transformed root cultures and betulin and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29677535> attenuates dexamethasone-induced oxidative damage through the JNK-P38 MAPK signaling pathway in mice.</a></h2><p>Dexamethasone (Dex), a potent anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive agent, has been shown to induce oxidative stress.  (BA) is a pentacyclic lupane triterpene with a potent antioxidant activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the ameliorative effect and underlying mechanisms of BA on Dex-induced oxidative damage. Mice were pretreated with BA orally (0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg) daily for 14 days, and then a single dose of Dex (25 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally 8 h after the last administration of BA to induce oxidative stress. BA pretreatment significantly alleviated Dex-induced changes of blood biochemical indices, increased the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the ability of inhibiting hydroxyl radical (AIHR), reduced the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum. Moreover, BA pretreatment enhanced the T-AOC, AIHR and the activity of peroxidase (POD) in liver, spleen and thymus. Concomitant with these biochemical parameters, BA pretreatment significantly reduced gene and protein expressions of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38 MAPK) in the lymphatic organs of Dex-treated mice. BA was found to effectively attenuate Dex-induced oxidative damage. These protective effects may be mediated in part through the JNK-P38 MAPK signaling transduction pathway and BA may be a potential therapeutic agent due to its anti-oxidative properties.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

There is a dearth of information of its effect in testis. This study evaluated the protective role of  (BA) against NDMA-induced redox imbalance in testes of rats.Twenty-four male rats were assigned into four groups and treated with normal saline, BA, NDMA and [BA+NDMA]. BA (25 mg/kg) was given for 14 days, while NDMA (5 mg/kg) was given on days 7 and 12.Administration of NDMA significantly increased the weight and relative weight of testes by 51 and 71%, respectively, while treatment with BA attenuated the weight-gain. Furthermore, NDMA decreased the sperm count, motility and live-dead ratio by 57, 36 and 37%, respectively, and increased total sperm abnormality by 56%. However, BA attenuated the changes in the spermiogram of NDMA-treated rats. NDMA significantly decreased the activities of antioxidative enzymes, follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones, while testicular levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and total cholesterol were increased. Also, NDMA increased the activities of aniline hydroxylase and aminopyrine-N-demethylase. Supplementation with BA attenuated NDMA-induced alteration in these biochemical indices.BA protects against NDMA-induced redox imbalance via activation of antioxidative pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28554130> derivative B10 inhibits glioma cell proliferation through suppression of SIRT1, acetylation of FOXO3a and upregulation of Bim/PUMA.</a></h2><p>Glioma is the most common primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. B10 is a new glycosylated derivative of  with enhanced cytotoxic activity. The present study was designed to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the anticancer effect of B10 in glioma cells. 25-50μM B10 resulted in a significant decrease of cell viability and BrdU incorporation. 25-50mg/kg B10 significantly reduced the implanted tumor weight and volume in nude mice. Activation of apoptosis was found in glioma cells when the cells were exposed to B10, as evidenced by increased number of TUNEL-stained cells, increased caspase 3 and 9 activities, and Bax and cleaved PARP expression. B10 caused a significant decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, mitochondrial complex I, II, III, IV, and V activities, and ATP level, and increase of mitochondrial ROS production, indicating the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction. B10 reduced the expression of sirtuin (SIRT) 1 and resulted in an increase in forkhead box O (FOXO) 3a expression and acetylation. Activation of SIRT1 by SRT-1720 and downregualtion of FOXO3a using shRNA significantly inhibited B10-induced cytotoxicity. B10 markedly increased the expression of Bim and PUMA. Downregualtion of FOXO3a or activation of SIRT1 significantly inhibited B10-induced increase of Bim and PUMA expression. Downregualtion of Bim or PUMA could suppress B10-induced increase of Bax expression. Moreover, B10-induced cytotoxicity was significantly suppressed by downregulation of Bim or PUMA. In summary, we identified B10 as a potent therapeutic candidate for glioma treatment and SIRT1-FOXO3a-Bim/PUMA axis as a novel therapeutic target.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Thus, we aimed to prepare novel 50:50 poly(lactic--glycolic acid) (PLGA)-loaded B nanoparticles (BNP) and to compare its anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) activity with parent B.BNP were synthesized and characterized using different methods such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry and particle size analyses. Particle size of BNP was optimized through the application of the stabilizer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The anti-HCC response was evaluated through in vitro cell line study using Hep-G2 cells, confocal microscopy, in vivo oral pharmacokinetics and animal studies. Further, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was conducted to observe the changes in the expression of specific genes.Particle size of BNP was optimized through the application of the stabilizer, polyvinyl alcohol. Physicochemical characterization exhibited particle size of 257.1 nm with zeta potential -0.170 mV (optimized batch B, BNP). SEM and FTIR analyses of BNP showed that cylindrical particles of B converted to spherical particles in BNP and there were no interaction between B and used polymers. The release study of optimized BNP was highest (≥80%) than any other formulation. Later, in vitro cell culture analysis using Hep-G2 cells and confocal microscopy studies revealed that BNP had the highest inhibition and penetration properties than parent B. Oral pharmacokinetics studies using albino Wistar rats at single 100 mg dose again exhibited BNP had the higher 50% of plasma concentration (t), a higher maximum plasma concentration () and took longer to reach the maximum plasma concentration (T) than parent B. Next, our in vivo study using nitrosodiethyl amine (NDEA)-induced HCC model documented BNP decreased in number of nodules, restored body weight, oxidative stress parameters, liver marker enzymes and histological architecture than parent B. Lastly, qRT-PCR studies further demonstrated that anti-HCC properties of BNP may be due to over expression of antiapoptotic caspases i.e., caspase 3 and 8.The prepared BNP showed a better therapeutic response against HCC and could be attributed as future candidate molecule for HCC treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31193405>Potential antigenotoxicity assessment of  fruit.</a></h2><p> Mill. fruits are nutritionally rich and have a broad spectrum of health benefits. In this work we hypothesized that this natural product rich in polyphenols might protect humans against DNA damage and its consequences. This has led to our investigation to find out if the fruit extract showed an ability to decrease the frequency of DNA damage (antigenotoxicity) induced by two known genotoxins namely an alkylating agent methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) and a reactive  species (ROS) inducer hydrogen peroxide (HO). Human lymphocytes were incubated with the  fruit ethanol extracts (ZFE) or  (BA) followed by an exposure to either 50 μM of MMS or 250 μM of HO. Results suggest that ZFE (250, 500, 1000 μg/ml) and BA (10, 20, 40 μg/ml) were able to inhibit the DNA damaging effect caused by MMS and HO indicative of their protection against the genotoxin. This could be attributed to the interactions of the phenolics, flavonoid and BA present in the fruits. Additional  experiments were carried since BA is an important phytochemical detected in ample amounts in the fruit extract. Mice were primed with BA (2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg body weight) for a period of 6 days. The animals were injected with MMS (10 mg/kg body weight) 24 h later and sacrificed. The genotoxic activity of MMS was inhibited in a dose - related manner by BA. BA reduced the frequency of MMS - induced DNA damage in liver, kidney and bone marrow cells of mice thereby exhibiting its antigenotoxic properties. It could also reduce total glutathione level, lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide content in liver cells of mice through the up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes. Therefore taking into account the antioxidant and antigenotoxic properties, the consumption of the  fruit should be more popularized worldwide.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27165106>Diversity-oriented natural product platform identifies plant constituents targeting Plasmodium falciparum.</a></h2><p>A diverse library of pre-fractionated plant extracts, generated by an automated high-throughput system, was tested using an in vitro anti-malarial screening platform to identify known or new natural products for lead development. The platform identifies hits on the basis of in vitro growth inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum and counter-screens for cytotoxicity to human foreskin fibroblast or embryonic kidney cell lines. The physical library was supplemented by early-stage collection of analytical data for each fraction to aid rapid identification of the active components within each screening hit.A total of 16,177 fractions from 1300 plants were screened, identifying several P. falciparum inhibitory fractions from 35 plants. Although individual fractions were screened for bioactivity to ensure adequate signal in the analytical characterizations, fractions containing less than 2.0 mg of dry  were combined to produce combined fractions (COMBIs). Fractions of active COMBIs had EC50 values of 0.21-50.28 and 0.08-20.04 µg/mL against chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant strains, respectively. In Berberis thunbergii, eight known alkaloids were dereplicated quickly from its COMBIs, but berberine was the most-active constituent against P. falciparum. The triterpenoids α- and β- of Eugenia rigida were also isolated as hits. Validation of the anti-malarial discovery platform was confirmed by these scaled isolations from B. thunbergii and E. rigida.These results demonstrate the value of curating and exploring a library of natural products for small molecule drug discovery. Attention given to the diversity of plant species represented in the library, focus on practical analytical data collection, and the use of counter-screens all facilitate the identification of anti-malarial compounds for lead development or new tools for chemical biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308098>Production of anti-cancer triterpene () from callus cultures of different Ocimum species and its elicitation.</a></h2><p> (BA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid, is gaining unmatched attention owing to its unique anti-cancer activity with selective melanoma growth inhibition without damaging normal cells. It is also well-known for its multifaceted pharmacokinetics, entailing antibacterial, antimalarial, anti-HIV and antioxidant merits. Considering the escalating demand with diminishing bioresource of this molecule, the present study was undertaken that revealed the untapped potentials of Ocimum calli, contrasting to that in the in vitro derived leaves, as effective production alternative of BA in three out of four tested species (i.e. Ocimum basilicum, Ocimum kilimandscharicum, Ocimum sanctum excluding Ocimum grattisimum). Callus inductions were obtained in all the four species with different 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)/α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) concentrations with kinetin. Notably, 2,4-D favoured maximum callus growth in all whereas NAA proved beneficial for the highest metabolite yield in the calli of each BA-producing species. The O. basilicum calli demonstrated the maximum growth (growth index (GI) 678.7 ± 24.47) and BA yield (2.59 ± 0.55 % dry weight [DW]), whereas those in O. kilimandscharicum (GI 533.33 ± 15.87; BA 1.87 ± 0.6 % DW) and O. sanctum (GI 448 ± 16.07; BA 0.39 ± 0.12 % DW) followed a descending order. The O. gratissimum calli revealed minimum growth (GI 159 ± 13.25) with no BA accumulation. Elicitation with methyl jasmonate at 200-μM concentration after 48-h exposure doubled the BA yield (5.10 ± 0.18 % DW) in NAA-grown O. basilicum calli compared to that in the untreated counterpart (2.61 ± 0.19 % DW), which further enthused its future application.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26549273>Protection of testis through antioxidant action of Mallotus roxburghianus in alloxan-induced diabetic rat model.</a></h2><p>Mallotus roxburghianus is used for its antihyperglycaemic properties in Southeast Asia especially in Northeast India (Mizoram) and is also recognized in traditional medicine. About 90% of diabetic patients have been associated with reproductive impairments. The primary aim of this investigation is to examine the effects of diabetes on oxidative stress, steroidogenesis, histopathology, proliferation of germ cells with proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and antioxidant status, and alleviative effect of M. roxburghianus on the testis dysfunction.Methanolic leaf extract of M. roxburghianus was given to male albino Wistar rats by oral gavage to study the acute toxicity. Phyto-chemical composition of the methanol extract of M. roxburghianus was analyzed by GC-MS. Male Wistar rats were divided into six groups with seven animals in each group: untreated control; M. roxburghianus methanolic extract control (MRME, 400mg/kg); Alloxan diabetic control group (150 mg/kg); diabetic with 100mg/kg MRME treatment; diabetic with 400mg/kg MRME treatment; and diabetic with glibenclamide (0.1mg/kg) treatment. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of 150 mg/kg alloxan and was confirmed by testing fasting plasma blood glucose levels 5 days after injection. MRME was administered orally for 28 days. Body and testis weights, serum testosterone, testis malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), glutathione S transferase (GST) and protein levels were measured, and testis tissue was examined histopathologically and immunohistochemically (PCNA).No sign of mortality and organ toxicity was observed up to 3000 mg/kg in acute toxicity assay of MRME and inferred to be non-toxic and safe. Bergenin and  are the major components of MRME with many biological activities. MRME treatment rendered significant increases in body weight, testis weight, testes-body weight ratio, down regulated the MDA levels, reduced the degeneration and disruption of seminiferous tubule structure, restored the antioxidant enzymes and serum testosterone levels, increased the PCNA activities and attenuated the testes injury.MRME treatment to diabetic rats improves diabetes induced oxidative damage in testis as well as provides protection to testis. Phenols (Bergenin) and terpenes () were the main compounds of MRME that show antioxidant and antidiabetic activities and indeed validated its traditional use in the management of diabetes related testicular impairment.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It is therefore of high importance to find methods to reduce cadmium accumulation in the human body. Herein, we report that administration of  (BA) protects mice from cadmium chloride (CdCl2)-induced toxicity by inhibiting cadmium-induced apoptosis in both kidney and liver. Mice were given oral doses of 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg of BA daily for ten consecutive days, and were injected with one dose of 1 mg/kg CdCl2 after one hour of BA administration every day. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were assessed by ELISA. Residual cadmium was determined by atomic absorption analysis. Protein expression was evaluated by western blotting. Pretreatment with BA significantly reduced residual cadmium levels in the liver, kidney and testis, increased the cadmium output in urine, and reduced tissue damage induced by CdCl2. Moreover, BA prevented body weight loss by CdCl2 in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, BA treatment increased the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), decreased Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), and inhibited the levels of active caspase-3. Importantly, BA within a dose of 30 mg/kg did not induce any signs of toxicity, and protected mice from the toxicity induced by CdCl2 in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that BA inhibits CdCl2 induced apoptosis in the kidney and liver, and BA may be an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of cadmium-induced diseases in humans.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

(BA), an antioxidant prepared from the white birch, exhibits immunomodulation properties. To assess the implications and investigate the mechanisms of BA-elicited immunomodulation, we hypothesized that Dex induced thymocyte apoptosis via oxidative stress could be lessened by BA.Mice were given oral doses of BA (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0mg/kg) daily for 14 days, and induced oxidative stress by giving a single dose of Dex intraperitoneal at the dosage of 25mg/kg body weight 8h after the last administration of BA.Dex administration alone significantly decreased antioxidant enzyme activities, while significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunctions, caspase-3 activation and cellular apoptosis. However, pretreatment with BA dose-dependently mitigated Dex-induced oxidative damage after 14 days of feeding. In addition to ROS scavenging activity in Dex-induced thymocyte, BA administration decreased lipid peroxidation, up-regulated antioxidant enzymes, restored mitochondrial function, increased Bcl-2 expression but reduced Bax expression, inhibited caspase-3 activation, and improved cell survival.These findings reveal a protective capability of BA against Dex-induced cell death by reducing oxidative stress via mitochondrial mediated signal pathway which could be the potential mechanism underlying BA-elicited immunomodulation.Copyright © 2015 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

In the initial phase, the acute effects were evaluated on the skin application site of a single extract dose. A skin irritation test was performed in male Wistar rats (n = 8/group) receiving the extract (50-150 mg/mL) with  (0.5-1.5%, respectively). A photosensitivity test was performed in male BALB/c mice (n = 6/group) receiving the extract (150 mg/mL). Afterwards, other BALB/c mice (n = 20, male:female, 1:1) were used to assess the systemic alterations caused by 14 daily repeated doses (150 mg/mL) by monitoring the effects on mortality, body morphology, behavior, nutrition status, neuromotor reactions, organ morphology and weight, and blood tests. At this time, 0.5 mg/mL clobetasol was used as the positive control. The skin irritation index suggested that negligible skin irritation had occurred, even when the extract was applied to the rat skin at 150 mg/mL. However, the extract acted as a photosensitizer on mouse skin, showing a photosensitizing activity close to that of 10 mg/mL 5-methoxypsoralen. Repeated doses caused no mouse mortality, aggressiveness, piloerection, diarrhea, convulsions, neuromotor alterations or nutrition status changes. The mouse organ weights did not change, and the mice did not have alterations in their blood compositions. Clobetasol caused a reduction in the mononuclear leukocyte numbers. In general, the data suggest that the extract was safe in healthy rodents but indicate that caution should be taken with the photosensitizing activity; in addition, this activity should be further explored as it may be useful for phototherapeutic drug development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27069720>Gastrokinetic activity of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius tuber in rats.</a></h2><p>The tuber of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Family-Araceae), commonly called suran or jimikand, has medicinal and food value. It is used in ethnomedicinal practices for correction of gastrointestinal disturbances such as constipation and hemorrhoids. The present study evaluated the effect of A. paeoniifolius tuber on gastrointestinal motor functions.The tuber was collected in December 2011, and its methanolic extract was standardized with the major phenolic compound, , by high-performance liquid chromatography. Rats were orally administered methanolic (APME) or aqueous (APAE) extract (250 and 500 mg/kg, each) of tuber for 7 days. Metoclopramide (MET) (3 mg/kg, orally) was used a reference prokinetic drug. The gastrointestinal parameters viz. number of feces, wet and dry  and moisture content of feces, gastric emptying, and intestinal transit were evaluated. The isolated tissue preparations were used to check the effect of the extracts on fundus and intestinal contractility. The glucomannan and total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined spectrophotometrically.The pre-treatment of extracts significantly increased the number of feces, wet and dry  of feces, moisture content, gastric emptying, and intestinal transit. Results were comparable to MET. Further, APME and APAE showed a contraction of fundus and ileum in isolated preparations. APME and APAE were also found to have fair amount of glucomannan, total phenolics, and flavonoids. The results indicate the gastrokinetic potential of the tuber extracts. This may be attributed to the presence of glucomannan and  present in the extracts.In conclusion, the tuber of A. paeoniifolius exhibits gastrokinetic activity and substantiates its traditional use in gastrointestinal motor disturbances.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27913938>Cardiotoxic and Dyslipidemic Effects of Doxorubicin and  Amide.</a></h2><p>Changes in the blood lipid spectrum and structural reorganization of the rat myocardium in response to injection of a single sublethal dose of doxorubicin (7 mg/kg) alone and in combination with course administration of betulonic acid amide (100 mg/kg/day for 14 days) were studied.  amide in the specified dose exhibited less pronounced cardiotoxic (necrobiotic impairment of cardiomyocytes) and dyslipidemic (increase of cholesterol and triglyceride levels) effects in comparison with doxorubicin.

In our study, we used current biomedical approaches to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of BXD and possible protective mechanism involved in inhibiting dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic ulcerative colitis model.Chronic DSS colitis was induced in C57BL/6 male mice by three cycles of 5 days of 2% DSS in drinking water, alternating with 5 days of normal water, totaling 30 days. In BXD group, the mice were administered at a dose of 8.7g/kg BXD for 5 days before and during DSS treatment via oral gavage per day. Mice in vehicle group and DSS group were given orally the same volume of drinking water, instead. Body weight, stool characters and hematochezia were observed everyday. The colorectal tissues were used to detect levels of TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-23 and MPO by ELISA or qRT-PCR. The expression of COX-2, 8-Oxoguanine and Nrf2 were examined by IHC, and p-p65 was examined by western blotting. ThOD and the content of MDA were measured according to kits respectively.BXD significantly protected against DSS-induced chronic ulcerative colitis by amelioration of body weight loss, DAI and histology score. The level of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-23, COX-2 and p-p65 were decreased significantly, while the level of IL-10 improved with the treatment of BXD. MDA, MPO and 8-Oxoguanine were decreased, meanwhile SOD activity and Nrf2 expression were elevated significantly by BXD.BXD possesses the potential of anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation to treat colitis. The protective mechanism of BXD may involve in inhibition of NF-κBp65 activation and increasement of Nrf2 expression in colorectums of mice.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

They elicit fear responses such as cowering, seeking out the owner, and attempting to escape. This can result in property damage, injury to the dog, and disruption of the owner-pet bond, possibly leading to pet abandonment or euthanasia. A novel botanical anxiolytic product was evaluated for safety in dogs as the target animal species. Its intended use is for the treatment and prevention of anxiety and noise aversion in dogs. It contains a defined mixture of  spp. vine and  spp. bark, delivering the active principle, , at a recommended dose of 1 mg/kg body weight (BW). In the current target animal safety study, 16 healthy male beagle dogs were administered either a placebo or the newly formulated botanical tablets at 0.5×, 2.5×, or 5× the recommended dose (1 mg/kg BW) over 28 d. The dogs were monitored for occurrence of any systemic or local adverse events. In the investigation presented here, there were no clinically significant adverse effects following treatment, as determined by clinical observations, physical examinations, BW, hematology, clinical biochemistry, and urinalysis. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the concentration of  in serum was below 0.020 μg/mL in treated animals. Under the conditions of these studies, the formulated blend of  and  when administered up to 5× the intended dose for 28 consecutive d, showed no adverse effects on the health of dogs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26592171>Protective effect and mechanism of action of lupane triterpenes from Cornus walteri in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.</a></h2><p>The present study reports a renoprotective effect and the mechanism of action of lupane triterpenes isolated from Cornus walteri in cisplatin-induced renal toxicity. A phytochemical investigation of the MeOH extract of the stems and stem bark of C. walteri resulted in the isolation and identification of twelve lupane triterpenes. Among these, , 29-oxobetulinic acid, betulin 3-acetate, and lupeol ameliorated cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity to 80% of the control value at 125 μM. Upregulated phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 following cisplatin treatment were markedly decreased after co-treatment with , 29-oxobetulinic acid, betulin 3-acetate, and lupeol. In addition, the protein expression level of cleaved caspase-3 and the percentage of apoptotic cells were also significantly reduced after co-treatment with , 29-oxobetulinic acid, betulin 3-acetate, and lupeol. These results show that blocking the MAPK signaling cascade plays a critical role in mediating the renoprotective effect of , 29-oxobetulinic acid, betulin 3-acetate, and lupeol isolated from C. walteri extract.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Various HPMA copolymer conjugates differing in the structure of the spacer between the drug and the carrier were synthesized, all designed for pH-triggered drug release in tumor tissue or tumor cells. The high molecular  of the micellar conjugates should improve the uptake of the drug in solid tumors due to the Enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Nevertheless, only the conjugate containing BA with methylated carboxyl groups enabled pH-dependent controlled release in vitro. Moreover, drug release led to the disassembly of the micellar structure, which facilitated elimination of the water-soluble HPMA copolymer carrier from the  by renal filtration. The methylated BA derivative and its polymer conjugate exhibited high cytostatic activity against DLD-1, HT-29, and HeLa carcinoma cell lines and enhanced tumor accumulation in HT-29 xenograft in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30799179> inhibits high-fat diet-induced obesity and improves energy balance by activating AMPK.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndromes are prevalent worldwide and result in various complications including obesity, cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes.  (BA) is a naturally occurring triterpenoid that has anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that treatment with BA may result in decreased body weight gain, adiposity and hepatic steatosis in a diet-induced mouse model of obesity.Mice fed a high-fat diet and treated with BA showed less weight gain and tissue adiposity without any change in calorie intake. Gene expression profiling of mouse tissues and cell lines revealed that BA treatment increased expression of lipid oxidative genes and decreased that of lipogenesis-related genes. This modulation was mediated by increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, which facilitates energy expenditure, lipid oxidation and thermogenic capacity and exerts protective effects against obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Overall, BA markedly inhibited the development of obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice fed a high-fat diet, and AMPK activation in various tissues and enhanced thermogenesis are two possible mechanisms underlying the antiobesity and antisteatogenic effects of BA.The current findings suggest that treatment with BA is a potential dietary strategy for preventing obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Renal fibrosis is a complication of kidney injury and associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. In our previous investigation, a lupane-type pentacyclic triterpenoid,  (BA) was found to have protective effect on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal fibrosis. This prompted us to explore the therapeutic value of UA, a chemically related compound to BA in CKD. CKD was induced by feeding adenine with the feed at a concentration of 0.75% for 28 days. UA at the dose rate of 30 mg/kg in 0.5% carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) was administered by oral route, simultaneously with adenine feeding for 28 days. Adenine feeding increased the kidney weight to body weight index, decreased the kidney function due to injury as indicated by increased markers like serum urea, uric acid, creatinine, cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and initiated the fibrotic response in kidney by increasing the profibrotic proteins viz. transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fibronectin and collagen. However, treatment with UA reversed the damage induced by adenine as shown by reduced kidney injury and fibrosis markers which was further clearly evident in histological picture indicating the suitability of UA for use in CKD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Thus, improved and more effective therapies are critical.  (BA), a pentacyclic triterpene is a compound in the pipeline of anti-cancer drug development. It has been shown to a possess variety of beneficial effects in many disease conditions. However, its efficacy against CKD is yet to be explored.The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of BA on renal fibrosis in the rat model of adenine-induced CKD.CKD rats gained significantly less weight during the experimental period when compared to control rats and BA treatment did not significantly increase the weight gain in CKD rats. CKD rats showed elevated levels of serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and uric acid along with increased levels of kidney injury markers such as cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). Further, in comparison to control rats, kidney samples from CKD rats revealed increased profibrotic protein levels like transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fibronectin, collagen type I and hydroxyproline indicating a progressive fibrotic response. These data are further fortified by histological findings where kidney damage and fibrosis are clearly evident as dilatation of tubules, glomerular degeneration and vacuolation along with deposition of collagen fibers. However, the above-mentioned findings in CKD rats were significantly reversed by BA-treatment revealing its nephroprotective potential and anti-fibrotic activity.The biochemical mechanism of the nephroprotective and anti-fibrotic effect of BA in the adenine-induced CKD rats might be mediated by inhibition of pro-fibrotic protein production thereby hindering the kidney tissue damage along with improvement in kidney function. Thus, BA could be an adjunct agent to retard fibrosis in CKD subjects.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.</p></html>
