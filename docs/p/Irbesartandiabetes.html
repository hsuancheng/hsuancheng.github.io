Relating the initial albuminuria reduction to subsequent renoprotection assumes that the initial ARB-induced albuminuria reduction remains stable during follow-up. The aim of this study was to assess individual albuminuria fluctuations after the initial ARB response and to determine whether taking individual albuminuria fluctuations into account improves renal outcome prediction.Patients with  and nephropathy treated with losartan or  in the RENAAL and IDNT trials were included. Patients with >30% reduction in albuminuria 3 months after ARB initiation were stratified by the subsequent change in albuminuria until Month 12 in enhanced responders (>50% albuminuria reduction), sustained responders (between 20 and 50% reduction), and response escapers (<20% reduction). Predictive performance of the individual albuminuria exposure until Month 3 was compared with the exposure over the first 12 months using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves.Following ARB initiation, 388 (36.3%) patients showed an >30% reduction in albuminuria. Among these patients, the albuminuria level further decreased in 174 (44.8%), remained stable in 123 (31.7%), and increased in 91 (23.5%) patients. Similar albuminuria fluctuations were observed in patients with <30% albuminuria reduction. Renal risk prediction improved when using the albuminuria exposure during the first 12 months versus the initial Month 3 change [ROC difference: 0.78 (95% CI 0.75-0.82) versus 0.68 (0.64-0.72); P < 0.0001].Following the initial response to ARBs, a large within-patient albuminuria variability is observed. Hence, incorporating multiple albuminuria measurements over time in risk algorithms may be more appropriate to monitor treatment effects and quantify renal risk.© The Author 2016.

ER stress-induced renal apoptosis seems to be involved in the development of diabetic nephropathy. The present study was designed to investigate the contribution of reduced ER stress to the beneficial effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker. Insulin-dependent  was induced by streptozotocin injections to hypertensive mRen2-transgenic rats. After 2weeks animals were treated with 0.7mg/kg/day . Blood glucose, blood pressure and protein excretion were assessed. Expression of ER stress markers was measured by real-time PCR. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect markers of ER stress, renal damage and infiltrating cells. Glomerulosclerosis and apoptosis were evaluated. Diabetic mRen2-transgenic rats developed renal injury with proteinuria, tubulointerstitial cell proliferation as well as glomerulosclerosis and podocyte injury. Moreover, an increase in inflammation, podocyte ER stress and apoptosis was detected.  somewhat lowered blood pressure and reduced proteinuria, tubulointerstitial cell proliferation and glomerulosclerosis. Podocyte damage was ameliorated but markers of ER stress (calnexin, grp78) and apoptosis were not reduced by . On the other hand, inflammatory cell infiltration in the tubulointerstitium and the glomerulus was significantly attenuated. We conclude that  reduced renal damage even in a very low dose. The beneficial effects of low dose  were paralleled by a reduction of blood pressure and inflammation but not by a reduction of ER stress and apoptosis. Thus, sustained endoplasmic reticulum stress in the kidney does not necessarily lead to increased inflammation and tubulointerstitial or glomerular injury.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Its response on different blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs was also studied. Sixty never-treated hypertensive patients (65.0% men, 46.9 years, BP 141.4/94.0 mm Hg) were randomized to an  (an angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) or a diltiazem (a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker [CCB])-based regimen. Patients with  or established cardiovascular, renal, or liver disease were excluded. Blood samples and 24-hour urine were analyzed at baseline and 6 months after pharmaceutical BP normalization. Serum creatinine was measured and eGFR was calculated. Urine albumin, creatinine, and α -microglobulin were measured and ACR was calculated. Minor changes (P=not significant [NS]) in eGFR were noted during follow-up in both groups (from 111.0 mL/min/1.73 m to 108.4 mL/min/1.73 m in the ARB group and from 111.3 mL/min/1.73 m to 114.0 mL/min/1.73 m in the CCB group). Twenty-four-hour urine indices were all significantly improved (P<.01) in the ARB group (albumin from 19.4 mg/L to 8.2 mg/L, ACR from 21.5 mg/g to 10.0 mg/g, α -microglobulin from 5.06 mg/L to 3.64 mg/L) but not (P=NS) in the CCB group (albumin from 15.6 mg/L to 13.9 mg/L, ACR from 17.6 mg/g to 17.1 mg/g, α -microglobulin from 4.94 mg/L to 4.79 mg/L). These differences between groups remained significant (P<.05) after adjusting for office heart rate and BP. α -Microglobulin was significantly correlated (P<.05) with albumin and ACR both at baseline (r=0.283 and 0.299, respectively) and at the end of follow-up (r=0.432 and 0.465, respectively) but not (P=NS) with eGFR. It was also significantly related (P<.05) to cardiovascular risk scores (Framingham and HeartScore) both at baseline (r=0.264 and 0.436, respectively) and at the end of follow-up (r=0.308 and 0.472, respectively). Urine α -microglobulin emerges as a potentially usable marker of hypertension-induced renal impairment.

In China, an estimated 34.7 percent of people diagnosed with  have renal complications and a further 50 percent die of renal failure. Hence, identification of alternative treatments for these patients should be given priority. The Shenyan Kangfu tablet (SYKFT) is a new formulation of an existing and widely acclaimed Chinese herbal tea for treating qi-yin deficiency syndrome. Because a considerable portion of DN patients presenting with symptoms of swelling, fatigue and weak limbs would be diagnosed with qi-yin deficiency syndrome according to the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnostic criteria, we hypothesize that SYKFT may represent a complementary drug for DN patients with the corresponding syndrome. In view of this, we have designed a trial to assess the efficacy and safety of SYKFT for patients with diabetic nephropathy exhibiting signs of qi and yin deficiency.This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The total target sample size is planned at 80 participants, with a balanced (1:1) treatment allocation. The experimental intervention will be SYKFY plus  (SI regimen) and the control intervention will be a placebo plus  (PI regimen). Participants will receive two courses of medication treatment each lasting 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be the composite of the quantitative 24-hour urinary protein level and urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER). Changes in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and DN staging, and TCM symptom improvement will be the secondary outcome measures. Adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the trial.This study will be the first placebo-controlled RCT to assess whether SYKFT plus  will have beneficial effects on enhancing overall response rate (ORR), changing DN staging, improving clinical symptoms, and reducing the frequency of AEs for DN patients with qi-yin deficiency syndrome.

Eight ARBs are clinically available [azilsartan, candesartan, eprosartan, , losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan]. Azilsartan (in some countries), candesartan, and olmesartan are orally administered as prodrugs, whereas the blocking action of some is mediated through active metabolites. On the basis of their chemical structures, ARBs use different binding pockets in the receptor, which are associated with differences in dissociation times and, in most cases, apparently insurmountable antagonism. The physicochemical differences between ARBs also manifest in different tissue penetration, including passage through the blood-brain barrier. Differences in binding mode and tissue penetration are also associated with differences in pharmacokinetic profile, particularly duration of action. Although generally highly specific for angiotensin II type 1 receptors, some ARBs, particularly telmisartan, are partial agonists at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. All of these properties are comprehensively reviewed in this article. Although there is general consensus that a continuous receptor blockade over a 24-hour period is desirable, the clinical relevance of other pharmacological differences between individual ARBs remains to be assessed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27216240>Chinese herbal medicine Tangshen Formula treatment of patients with type 2 diabetic kidney disease with macroalbuminuria: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.</a></h1><p>Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the most common microvascular complications of  and the main cause of end-stage renal disease.

However, the underlying mechanisms that improve hyperlipidemia and  steatosis are unclear. This study investigated the effects of Irb on lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis using the spontaneous type 2 diabetic db/db mouse model. The results demonstrated body and  weight, food consumption, lipid content in serum and  tissue, and  dysfunction as well as hepatic steatosis were increased in db/db mice compared with db/m mice, whereas the increases were reversed by Irb treatment. Moreover, Irb administration resulted in an increase in LC3BII as well as the LC3BII/I ratio through activating PPAR-γ and p-AMPK and inhibiting p-Akt and p-mTOR, thereby inducing autophagy in the db/db mouse . Therefore, our findings suggest that Irb can ameliorate hyperlipidemia and  steatosis by upregulating the expression of PPAR-γ, activating the AMPK/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and inducing  autophagy.Copyright © 2016.

However, its mechanisms still remain unclear. We examined the extent to which the angiotensin-II type 1 receptor blocker (AT1RB)  and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) perindopril affected the apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, cytochrome-c and Ku70 in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats.Animals were divided into five groups of eight each, four of which received STZ (60mg/kg in a single dose, i.p.) to induce diabetes. The groups were performed as untreated diabetic; non-diabetic control; daily  (15mg/kg/day) or perindopril (6mg/kg/day) and also combined  and perindopril (respectively, 5mg/kg/day, 3mg/kg/day) were applied by gavage for 30days to STZ-diabetic rats. The kidney tissue analysis was performed by using immunohistochemical staining with Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, cytochrome-c and Ku70 antibodies and by using Western blot analysis with caspase-3 and cytochrome-c antibodies.Immunoreactivity of Bax, caspase-3, cytochrome-c and Ku70 was increased in the tubuli and glomeruli of the untreated diabetic group, but decreased in all treated diabetic groups. In the  and perindopril treated diabetic groups Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was higher than that of the untreated diabetic group. Caspase-3 and cytoplasmic cytochrome-c protein levels increased in the untreated diabetic group.We conclude that the increased expression of Bax and caspase-3, and the increased level of cytoplasmic cytochrome-c relate to renal tissue injury. This case is also seen in the early stages of diabetes as a result of the damage caused by local increased expression of renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the renal tissue, which is induced by hyperglycemia. The increase of the cytosolic cytochrome-c, caspase-3 and Ku70 expression in the tubuli is suggestive of apoptosis. Overall, our results show that treatments of  and perindopril are effective and efficient in preventing renal tissue injury and apoptosis by blocking the RAS in experimental diabetic nephropathy and reducing the expression of proteins associated with apoptosis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs, e.g., eprosartan, losartan, candesartan, valsartan, telmisartan, olmesartan, , and azilsartan) have been developed and are available for clinical use, and basic and clinical studies have shown that ARBs are useful for preventing the development of cardiovascular disease. While most ARBs have common molecular structures (biphenyl-tetrazol and imidazole groups), they also show slightly different structures. Some of the benefits conferred by ARBs may not be class-specific effects, and instead may be molecule-specific effects. Their common molecular structures are thought to be responsible for their class effects, whereas their slightly different structures may be important for promoting molecule-specific effects.

So, we investigated renal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, alone and in combination with  in a rat model of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic rats, injected with nicotinamide-streptozotocin, were treated orally for 12 weeks with either vehicle, dapagliflozin 2 mg/kg/day,  30 mg/kg/day, or combination of both drugs; respectively. Biochemical analysis included blood glucose, HbA1c, urinary albumin excretion, creatinine clearance, TGF-β1, sRAGE, oxidative markers, and histopathological examination of kidneys. Treatment with dapagliflozin, , and especially their combination, produced significant reduction in albuminuria, improved renal function parameters, increased sRAGE level and improved inflammatory and oxidative markers, together with amelioration of renal histopathological changes. Beside glycemic control, dapagliflozin produced higher sRAGE levels than , suggesting that inhibition of AGE-RAGE axis is important in its renoprotective action. Combination of dapagliflozin and  produced more remarkable protective effects on renal function and structure, than use of either agent alone. It is concluded that, combination of SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin and ARB,  could offer more effective renal protection and represent a promising therapeutic option for management of diabetic nephropathy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Treatment of patients with MetS regularly includes drugs prescribed simultaneously to treat diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the development of novel multidrug formulations is recommended. However, the main problem with these drugs is their low solubility. The use of binary co-amorphous systems emerges as a promising strategy to increase drug solubility. In the present study,  (IBS) and glimepiride (GMP), class II active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), widely used in the treatment of arterial hypertension and diabetes, were selected to develop a novel binary co-amorphous system with remarkable enhancement in the dissolution of both APIs. The phase diagram of IBS-GMP was constructed and co-amorphous systems were prepared by melt-quench, in a wide range of compositions. Dissolution profile (studied at pH 1.2 and 37°C for mole fractions 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5) demonstrated that the x = 0.01 formulation presents the highest enhancement in its dissolution. GMP went from being practically insoluble to reach 3.9 ± 0.9 μg/mL, and IBS showed a 12-fold increment with respect to the dissolution of its crystalline form. Infrared studies showed that the increase in the dissolution profile is related to the intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonds), which were dependent of composition.

It significantly decreased to 45.6+/-62.5mg/24 hours at the end of 3 months of  treatment (p<0.001). When patients were stratified according to the change in the microalbuminuria status after treatment, 90% of them either returned to normo albuminuria or their microalbuminuria decreased. Both diastolic and systolic blood pressures, fasting and non-fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c were found to be significantly decreased after 3 months of  treatment compared to pre-treatment values. The positive effect of  on microalbuminuria occurs independently from HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and blood pressures.The short-term treatment of  is effective to decrease microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2  patients, independent of its antihypertensive effect. There is a need for multicenter prospective studies to investigate this further.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23300289>Creatinine excretion rate and mortality in type 2  and nephropathy.</a></h1><p>The creatinine excretion rate (CER) is inversely associated with mortality in the general and renal transplant population. The CER is a marker for muscle mass. It is unknown whether the CER is associated with outcome in . We therefore investigated whether the CER is a determinant of all-cause mortality in diabetic patients.We used data from the combined Reduction of Endpoints in Non-insulin dependent  with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) and  Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) studies. A total of 1,872 patients (58% of the overall population) with type 2  and nephropathy with valid 24-h urinary creatinine excretion data were included. The primary end point of the analyses was all-cause mortality.Mean age was 60 ± 8 years and median CER was 1,407 (total range 400-3,406) mg/day. Body surface area, hemoglobin, black race, and albuminuria were positive independent determinants of the CER, whereas female sex and age were inverse independent determinants of the CER. During a median follow-up of 36 (29-45) months, 300 patients died. In a Kaplan-Meier analysis of sex-stratified tertiles of the CER, risk for all-cause mortality increased with decreasing CER (P < 0.001). In a multivariable Cox regression analysis, lower CER (as a continuous variable) was independently associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.39 [95% CI 0.29-0.52], P < 0.001). Adjustment for potential collection errors did not materially change these associations.Lower CER was strongly associated with increased all-cause mortality in patients with type 2  and nephropathy. As the CER can be considered a proxy for muscle mass, this puts renewed emphasis on physical condition and exercise in this population.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23836857>Comparative effectiveness of angiotensin-receptor blockers for preventing macrovascular disease in patients with : a population-based cohort study.</a></h1><p>Telmisartan, unlike other angiotensin-receptor blockers, is a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, a property that has been associated with improvements in surrogate markers of cardiovascular health in small trials involving patients with . However, whether this property translates into a reduced risk of cardiovascular events and death in these patients is unknown. We sought to explore the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure in patients with  who were taking telmisartan relative to the risk of these events occurring in patients taking other angiotensin-receptor blockers.We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of Ontario residents with  aged 66 years and older who started treatment with candesartan, , losartan, telmisartan or valsartan between Apr. 1, 2001, and Mar. 31, 2011. Our primary outcome was a composite of admission to hospital for acute myocardial infarction, stroke or heart failure. We examined each outcome individually in secondary analyses, in addition to all-cause mortality.We identified 54,186 patients with  who started taking an angiotensin-receptor blocker during the study period. After multivariable adjustment, patients who took either telmisartan (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.97) or valsartan (adjusted HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.95) had a lower risk of the composite outcome compared with patients who took .

In secondary analyses, we found a reduced risk of admission to hospital for heart failure with telmisartan compared with  (adjusted HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.96), but no significant differences in risk were seen between angiotensin-receptor blockers in our other secondary analyses.Compared with other angiotensin-receptor blockers, telmisartan and valsartan were both associated with a lower risk of admission to hospital for acute myocardial infarction, stroke or heart failure among older adults with  and hypertension. Telmisartan and valsartan may therefore be the preferred angiotensin-receptor blockers for use in these patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25060893>Bilirubin: a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for diabetic nephropathy.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26684588>Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes of long-term angiotensin receptor blockade: meta-analyses of trials in essential hypertension.</a></h1><p>Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used in managing essential hypertension, with considerable evidence available on their short-term efficacy in lowering blood pressure (BP). However, there currently exists limited "pooled" data examining the long-term efficacy of ARB treatment in controlling BP or mitigating cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the long-term effects of ARBs as a class on BP control, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, cerebrovascular events (ie, stroke), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to March 2015. Two evaluators independently reviewed studies for eligibility. Randomized controlled hypertension trials were included if they reported on ARB efficacy in either BP control (relative to placebo for periods ≥ 6 months) or cardiovascular/cerebrovascular outcomes (relative to non-ARB antihypertensive therapies for periods ≥ 24 months). Studies were pooled with a random-effects model using weighted mean differences (WMDs) and relative risks for continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. A total of 11 articles were included in the narrative synthesis, representing seven unique trials (16,864 participants). Six ARB agents were studied: candesartan, eprosartan, , olmesartan, losartan (each represented by one trial arm), and telmisartan (represented by two arms). ARB therapy significantly reduced mean systolic BP (WMD: -4.86; 95% CI: -6.19, -3.53 mm Hg) and diastolic BP (WMD: -2.75; 95% CI: -3.65, -1.86 mm Hg] compared to placebo. The risk of stroke was reduced by 21% in the ARB group compared with alternative antihypertensives (risk ratio: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.96). ARBs did not, however, produce statistically significant reductions in the risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization, or mortality. Our findings suggest that ARBs, as a class, are more effective than placebo therapy in long-term BP lowering in patients with essential hypertension. Long-term ARB treatment may also confer enhanced protection against stroke but not other cardiovascular outcomes relative to placebo.Copyright © 2016 American Society of Hypertension.

Analysis of covariance and logistic multivariate regression models were used to estimate the blood pressure (BP) outcomes of 73,012 patients during 13 months of treatment with olmesartan, losartan, valsartan, and . Results were adjusted by baseline BP, starting dose, year, age, sex, race, body mass index, comorbid conditions, and concomitant medications of patients. All ARBs led to sustained reductions in BP, but with significant differences in the magnitude of BP reduction. Raw mean systolic BP/diastolic BP reductions with losartan, valsartan, , and olmesartan were 9.3/4.9 mm Hg, 10.4/5.6 mm Hg, 10.1/5.3 mm Hg, and 12.4/6.8 mm Hg, respectively. Adjusting for all covariates, the overall BP reductions with olmesartan were 1.88/0.86 mm Hg, 1.21/0.52 mm Hg, and 0.89/0.51 mm Hg greater than for losartan, valsartan, and , respectively, and mean differences were higher for monotherapy: 2.43/1.16 mm Hg; 2.18/0.93 mm Hg; 1.44/0.91 mm Hg, respectively (all P values <.0001). Adjusted odds ratios of the JNC 7 goal attainment for losartan, valsartan, and  compared with olmesartan were 0.76, 0.86, and 0.91 (P<.05). Differences were also found in subpopulations: African Americans, diabetics, and obese/overweight patients but not all of these reached statistical significance.

Our aim was to determine whether urinary angiotensinogen and renin are circulating RAAS-independent markers during RAAS blockade.Urinary and plasma levels of angiotensinogen, renin, and albumin were measured in 22 patients with type 2 , hypertension, and albuminuria, during 2-month treatment periods with placebo, aliskiren, , or their combination in random order in a crossover study.Aliskiren and  both increased plasma renin 3-4-fold, and above 10-fold when combined.  decreased plasma angiotensinogen by approximately 25%, and no changes in plasma angiotensinogen were observed during the combination. Urine contained aliskiren at micromolar levels, blocking urinary renin by above 90%. Both blockers reduced urinary angiotensinogen, significant for  only. Combination blockade reduced urinary angiotensinogen even further. Reductions in urinary angiotensinogen paralleled albuminuria changes, and the urine/plasma concentration ratio of angiotensinogen was identical to that of albumin under all conditions. In contrast, urinary renin did not follow albumin, and remained unaltered after all treatments. Yet, the urine/plasma concentration ratio of renin was more than 100-fold higher than that of angiotensinogen and albumin, and approximately 4-fold reduced by single RAAS blockade, and more than 10-fold by dual RAAS blockade.Aliskiren filters into urine and influences urinary renin measurements. The urine/plasma renin ratio, but not urinary renin alone, may reflect the renal efficacy of RAAS blockade. Urinary angiotensinogen is a marker of filtration barrier damage rather than intrarenal RAAS activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26880862> Ameliorates Diabetic Nephropathy by Suppressing the RANKL-RANK-NF-κB Pathway in Type 2 Diabetic db/db Mice.</a></h1><p>The receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and its receptor RANK are overexpressed in focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), IgA nephropathy (IgAN), and membranous nephropathy (MN). However, the expression and the potential roles of RANKL and RANK in diabetic nephropathy (DN) remain unclear.

Our present study investigated the effects of Irb in DN and whether the renal protective effects of Irb are mediated by RANKL/RANK and the downstream NF-κB pathway in db/db mice. Our results showed that db/db mice revealed severe metabolic abnormalities, renal dysfunction, podocyte injury, and increased MCP-1; these symptoms were reversed by Irb. At the molecular level, RANKL and RANK were overexpressed in the kidneys of db/db mice and Irb downregulated RANKL and RANK and inhibited the downstream NF-κB pathway.

And they were divided into four groups: diabetic nephropathy (vehicle treatment),  (20 mg×kg(-1)×d(-1)), low-dosage XST (900 mg×kg(-1)×d(-1)) and high-dosage XST (1800 mg×kg(-1)×d(-1)). Seven normal rats were used as control. After a 12-week intervention, urine protein was examined. Pathological morphology was observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Masson and (periodic acid Schiff) PAS stains. Blood nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and blood superoxide dismutase (SOD) and urine SOD were detected. And the expression of (matrix metalloproteinase-2) MMP-2 was detected by Western blot in each group.The model rats presented with hyperglycemia, polydipsia, hyperphagia, polyuria and hyper microalbuminuria.

Glomerular sclerosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) increased in model group and improved in  and XST groups as judged by HE, Masson and PAS stains. Three intervention groups had no effect on the elevated expression of MMP-2 in diabetic rats.

Diabetic rats were then randomly treated with vehicle (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose; SCC), TW combined with SCC (8 or 16 mg/kg) or  (50 mg/kg) daily for 8 weeks. Metabolic parameter levels and renal pathological changes were examined. mRNA and protein expression of Wnt-1, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, β-catenin, nuclear factor (NF)-κB and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in the kidneys of rats from all groups were measured. Compared with the DM group, metabolic parameters and morphological parameters, apart from blood glucose levels, were significantly improved in TW-treated rats (all P<0.01). Furthermore, levels of Wnt-1, β-catenin, NF-κB-p65 and TGF-β1 mRNA and protein were significantly reduced in the kidneys of TW-treated rats compared with DM rats, whereas levels of GSK-3β mRNA and protein did not differ significantly between any of the groups; however, the expression of P-GSK-3β protein was significantly decreased in the kidneys of TW-treated rats compared with the DM group. The protective effects of TW tended to be dose-dependent and were an improvement compared with  treatment in diabetic rats. Therefore, the results of the present study indicated that treatment with TW mitigated hyperglycemia-induced upregulated Wnt-1 and β-catenin expression in kidney tissues and ameliorated -induced kidney injury in rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22002336>Renal responses to three types of renin-angiotensin system blockers in patients with  on a high-salt diet:  a need for higher doses in diabetic patients?</a></h1><p>Activation of the renal renin-angiotensin system in patients with  appears to contribute to the risk of nephropathy. Recently, it has been recognized than an elevation of prorenin in plasma also provides a strong indication of risk of nephropathy. This study was designed to examine renin-angiotensin system control mechanisms in the patient with .We enrolled 43 individuals with type 2 . All individuals were on a high-salt diet to minimize the contribution of the systemic renin-angiotensin system. After an acute exposure to captopril (25 mg), they were randomized to treatment with either  (300 mg) or aliskiren (300 mg) for 2 weeks.All agents acutely lowered blood pressure and plasma aldosterone, and increased renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. Yet, only captopril and aliskiren acutely increased plasma renin and decreased plasma angiotensin II, whereas  acutely affected neither renin nor angiotensin II. Plasma renin and angiotensin II subsequently did increase upon chronic  treatment. When given on day 14,  and aliskiren again induced the above hemodynamic, renal and adrenal effects, yet without significantly changing plasma renin.  at that time did not affect plasma angiotensin II, whereas aliskiren lowered it to almost zero.The relative resistance of the renal renin response to acute () and chronic ( and aliskiren) renin-angiotensin system blockade supports the concept of an activated renal renin-angiotensin system in , particularly at the level of the juxtaglomerular cell, and implies that diabetic patients might require higher doses of renin-angiotensin system blockers to fully suppress the renal renin-angiotensin system.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22474255>Loss of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 exacerbates diabetic cardiovascular complications and leads to systolic and vascular dysfunction: a critical role of the angiotensin II/AT1 receptor axis.</a></h1><p>Diabetic cardiovascular complications are reaching epidemic proportions. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. We hypothesize that loss of ACE2 exacerbates cardiovascular complications induced by .To define the role of ACE2 in diabetic cardiovascular complications.We used the well-validated Akita mice, a model of human , and generated double-mutant mice using the ACE2 knockout (KO) mice (Akita/ACE2(-/y)). Diabetic state was associated with increased ACE2 in Akita mice, whereas additional loss of ACE2 in these mice leads to increased plasma and tissue angiotensin II levels, resulting in systolic dysfunction on a background of impaired diastolic function. Downregulation of SERCA2 and lipotoxicity were equivalent in Akita and Akita/ACE2KO hearts and are likely mediators of the diastolic dysfunction. However, greater activation of protein kinase C and loss of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation occurred in the Akita/ACE2KO hearts. Systolic dysfunction in Akita/ACE2KO mice was linked to enhanced activation of NADPH oxidase and metalloproteinases, resulting in greater oxidative stress and degradation of the extracellular matrix. Impaired flow-mediated dilation in vivo correlated with increased vascular oxidative stress in Akita/ACE2KO mice. Treatment with the AT1 receptor blocker,  rescued the systolic dysfunction, normalized altered signaling pathways, flow-mediated dilation, and the increased oxidative stress in the cardiovascular system.Loss of ACE2 disrupts the balance of the renin-angiotensin system in a diabetic state and leads to an angiotensin II/AT1 receptor-dependent systolic dysfunction and impaired vascular function.

ApoE KO mice placed on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks were divided into four groups: i) the control (HFD only), ii) the HFD +  (5 mg/kg/day), iii) the HFD +  + GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist (0.5 mg/kg/day) and iv) the HFD +  + anti-HGF neutralizing antibody (200 μg/week). The liver and epididymal adipose tissues were evaluated histologically. Serum adiponectin and HGF levels were also measured by ELISA.

The gradual decline in kidney function in the presence of these risk factors is also associated with increased cardiovascular disease. Excess angiotensin II production by the renin-angiotensin system is responsible, at least in part, for development of hypertension and for damage in the kidneys and the cardiovascular system. Pharmacological targeting of the renin-angiotensin system not only reduces blood pressure, but may also provides more direct vascular protection. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are better tolerated than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and, thus, may be a more practical therapeutic option. Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of , losartan, telmisartan and valsartan in the management of CKD. All ARBs tested to date have proved effective in improving at least some aspects of renal dysfunction. Few within-class comparative studies exist. Telmisartan provides superior reductions in proteinuria to losartan, however, even when blood pressures are equalized with concomitant antihypertensives. This superiority is probably linked to higher receptor affinity, longer plasma half-life and higher lipophilicity of telmisartan compared with other ARBs. The reduction of proteinuria with ARBs is also linked to improved cardiovascular outcomes.

The delapril/manidipine fixed-dose combination consists of two antihypertensive agents with different, yet complementary, mechanisms of action. Delapril/manidipine has demonstrated short- and long-term antihypertensive efficacy in a number of clinical studies in patients with hypertension with an inadequate response to monotherapy.

We excluded patients with previous history of coronary artery disease and/or ischemic pattern of hyper enhancement on LGE MRI. Myocardial enhancement was defined using signal intensity >2SD above the mean signal intensity of a remote myocardium. Major adverse cardiovascular events were defined as cardiovascular death and heart failure requiring hospitalization.During a mean follow up period of 851 ± 609 days, 10 events (2 cardiovascular death, 8 hospitalization for heart failure decompensation) were observed. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of LGE% for the detection of future events was 0.721 (95% CI: 0.628-0.802). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that LGE% is an independent predictor of future events after the adjustment with prognostic 5 factors - age, , New York Heart Association classification, history of heart failure hospitalization and left ventricular ejection fraction - which were identified in the I-PRESERVE study ( in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction Study) (hazard ratio=7.913, 95% CI: 1.603-39.05, P=0.012).Larger size of LGE was significantly associated with high rate of future cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization, suggesting that the quantification of myocardial focal fibrosis by LGE MRI could be useful for the risk stratification in HFpEF patients.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The blood pressure control remains a fundamental mechanism for prevention of cardiovascular disease. The renin-angiotensin system is believed to play an important role along different steps of the cardiovascular disease continuum. Convincing evidence accumulated over the last decade that therapeutic intervention with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is effective to slow down or block the progression of cardiovascular disease at different steps of the continuum, with measurable clinical benefits. However, despite the shared mechanism of action, each ARB is characterized by specific pharmacological properties that may influence its clinical efficacy. Indeed, important differences among available ARBs emerged from clinical studies. Therefore, generalization of results obtained with a specific ARB to all available ARBs may be misleading. The present review provides a comparative assessment of the different ARBs in their efficacy on major clinical endpoints along the different steps of the cardiovascular disease continuum.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28260186>Efficacy of Zofenopril vs.  in Combination with a Thiazide Diuretic in Hypertensive Patients with Multiple Risk Factors not Controlled by a Previous Monotherapy: A Review of the Double-Blind, Randomized "Z" Studies.</a></h1><p>Combinations between an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) are among the recommended treatments for hypertensive patients uncontrolled by monotherapy. Four randomized, double-blind, parallel group studies with a similar design, including 1469 hypertensive patients uncontrolled by a previous monotherapy and with ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor, compared the efficacy of a combination of a sulfhydryl ACE inhibitor (zofenopril at 30 or 60 mg) or an ARB ( at 150 or 300 mg) plus HCTZ 12.5 mg. The extent of blood pressure (BP)-lowering was assessed in the office and over 24 h. Pleiotropic features of the treatments were evaluated by studying their effect on systemic inflammation, organ damage, arterial stiffness, and metabolic biochemical parameters. Both treatments similarly reduced office and ambulatory BPs after 18-24 weeks. In the ZODIAC study a larger reduction in high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) was observed under zofenopril (-0.52 vs. +0.97 mg/dL under , p = 0.001), suggesting a potential protective effect against the development of atherosclerosis. In the ZENITH study the rate of carotid plaque regression was significantly larger under zofenopril (32% vs. 16%; p = 0.047). In the diabetic patients of the ZAMES study, no adverse effects of treatments on blood glucose and lipids as well as an improvement of renal function were observed. In patients with isolated systolic hypertension of the ZEUS study, a slight and similar improvement in renal function and small reductions in pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AI), and central systolic BP were documented with both treatments. Thus, the fixed combination of zofenopril and HCTZ may have a relevant place in the treatment of high-risk or monotherapy-treated uncontrolled hypertensive patients requiring a more prompt, intensive, and sustained BP reduction, in line with the recommendations of current guidelines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18359872>A health economic analysis of screening and optimal treatment of nephropathy in patients with type 2  and hypertension in the USA.</a></h1><p>Nephropathy is an indicator of end-organ damage and is a strong predictor of an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death in patients with . Screening can lead to early identification and treatment, both of which incur costs. However, identification and treatment may slow or prevent progression to a more expensive stage of the disease and thus may save money. We assessed the health economic impact of screening for nephropathy (microalbuminuria and overt nephropathy) followed by optimal renoprotective-based antihypertensive therapy in a US setting.A Markov model simulated the lifetime impact of screening with semi-quantitative urine dipsticks in a primary care setting of hypertensive patients with type 2  and subsequent treatment with  300 mg in patients identified as having nephropathy. Progression from no nephropathy to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was simulated. Probabilities, utilities, medication and ESRD treatment costs came from published sources. Clinical outcomes and direct medical costs were projected. Second order Monte Carlo simulation was used to account for uncertainty in multiple parameters. Annual discount rates of 3% were used where appropriate.Screening, followed by optimized treatment, led to a 44% reduction in the cumulative incidence of ESRD and improvements in non-discounted life expectancy of 0.25 +/- 0.22 years/patient (mean +/- SD). Quality-adjusted life expectancy was improved by 0.18 +/- 0.15 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)/patient and direct costs increased by $244 +/- 3499/patient. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $20 011 per QALY gained for screening and optimized treatment versus no screening. There was a 77% probability that screening and optimized therapy would be considered cost effective with a willingness to pay a threshold of $50 000.In patients with type 2  and hypertension, screening for nephropathy and treatment with a renoprotective-based antihypertensive agent was projected to improve patient outcomes and represent excellent value in a US setting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22939518>Effect of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system on the progression of type 2 diabetic nephropathy: a randomized trial.</a></h1><p>Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers has been shown to lessen the rate of decrease in glomerular filtration rate in patients with diabetic nephropathy.A multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of combining the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril and the angiotensin II receptor blocker  with that of each drug in monotherapy (at both high and equipotent doses) in slowing the progression of type 2 diabetic nephropathy.133 patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy (age, 66 ± 8 years; 76% men) from 17 centers in Spain.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:2) to lisinopril (n = 35),  (n = 28), or the combination of both (n = 70).The primary composite outcome was a >50% increase in baseline serum creatinine level, end-stage renal disease, or death.Baseline values for mean estimated glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure were 49 ± 21 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and 153 ± 19/81 ± 11 mm Hg. Mean geometric baseline proteinuria was protein excretion of 1.32 (95% CI, 1.10-1.62) g/g creatinine. After a median follow-up of 32 months, 21 (30%) patients in the combination group, 10 (29%) in the lisinopril group, and 8 (29%) in the  group reached the primary outcome.

There were no significant differences in proteinuria reduction or blood pressure control between groups. The number of adverse events, including hyperkalemia, was similar in all 3 groups.The study was not double blind. The sample size studied was small.We were unable to show a benefit of the combination of lisinopril and  compared to either agent alone at optimal high doses on the risk of progression of type 2 diabetic nephropathy.Copyright © 2013 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

Our previous research found that carnosic acid (CA) or rosemary extract can effectively improve glucose and lipid metabolism disorder by inhibiting SREBPs.In this study, we aimed to explore the therapeutic effects of CA on the DN.The mice glomerular mesangial cells (mGMCs) were used to evaluate the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammation effects of CA under high glucose (HG) condition. Furthermore, db/db mice and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice were used to investigate the effects of CA against DN in vivo.The results showed that CA activated Nrf2, inhibited NF-κB pathway and regulated related downstream genes in mGMC under HG condition. A 14-week treatment of mice with CA reduced water uptake and urine volume, attenuated -induced albuminuria, increased urine creatinine, and subsequently improved the glomerular sclerosis and mesangial expansion in db/db mice. Similarly, a 20-week oral administration of CA improved kidney damage in STZ-induced diabetic mice. In addition, CA inhibited the expression of profibrotic factors, such as TGF-β1, fibronectin and E-cadherin. Compared to , CA exerted better glucose lowering effect, and in kidney, CA was more potent to reduce fibronectin and E-cadherin expression. In all the animal experiment, CA did not lead to abnormal damages to other tissues.These findings suggest that CA is a safe compound which exerts the protective effects on -induced kidney complications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

We hypothesized that ARNI improves cardiac and kidney parameters in diabetic TGR(mREN2)27 rats, an angiotensin II-dependent hypertension model. Rats were made diabetic with streptozotocin for 5 or 12 weeks. In the final 3 weeks, rats were treated with vehicle,  (ARB) or +thiorphan (ARNI). Blood pressure, measured by telemetry in the 5-week group, was lowered identically by ARB and ARNI. The heart weight/tibia length ratio in 12-week diabetic animals was lower after ARNI compared with after ARB. Proteinuria and albuminuria were observed from 8 weeks of  onwards. ARNI reduced proteinuria more strongly than ARB, and a similar trend was seen for albuminuria. Kidneys of ARNI-treated animals showed less severe segmental glomerulosclerosis than those of ARB-treated animals. After 12 weeks, no differences between ARNI- and ARB-treated animals were found regarding diuresis, natriuresis, plasma endothelin-1, vascular reactivity (acetylcholine response) or kidney sodium transporters. Only ARNI-treated rats displayed endothelin type B receptor-mediated vasodilation. In conclusion, ARNI reduces proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and heart weight in diabetic TGR(mREN2)27 rats more strongly than does ARB, and this occurs independently of blood pressure.© 2016 The Author(s). published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21454798>Long-term effects of  treatment and smoking on nucleic acid oxidation in patients with type 2  and microalbuminuria: an  in patients with type 2  and Microalbuminuria (IRMA 2) substudy.</a></h1><p>We tested whether long-term treatment with the angiotensin II receptor antagonist  reduces nucleic acid oxidation in patients with type 2  and microalbuminuria.The  in Patients With Type 2  and Microalbuminuria (IRMA 2) study was a 2-year multicenter randomized double-blind trial comparing  (150 and 300 mg once daily) with placebo.

The cost-effectiveness of this therapy, however, is unknown. Here, we used a Markov model to project progression to ESRD, life years, quality-adjusted life years, and lifetime costs for aliskiren plus losartan versus losartan. We used data from the AVOID study and the  in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) to estimate probabilities of progression of renal disease. We estimated probabilities of mortality for ESRD and other comorbidities using data from the US Renal Data System, US Vital Statistics, and published studies. We based pharmacy costs on wholesale acquisition costs and based costs of ESRD and transplantation on data from the US Renal Data System. We found that adding aliskiren to losartan increased time free of ESRD, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.1772, 0.1021, and 0.0967 yr, respectively. Total expected lifetime health care costs increased by $2952, reflecting the higher pharmacy costs of aliskiren and losartan ($7769), which were partially offset by savings in costs of ESRD ($4860). We estimated the cost-effectiveness of aliskiren to be $30,500 per quality-adjusted life year gained.

Hyperglycemia induces several pathological alterations which upregulate this system, accounting for overexpression of its downstream signaling molecules, amongst which angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone hold prime pathological notoriety. Although it is well known that elevated plasma levels of Ang II play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of type-II diabetic , by inducing and aggravating insulin resistance, it is not quite much known that it equally elevates the possibility/risk of development of diabetic complications. Also, amongst the various diabetic complications, the effects of Ang II upregulation are more widely acknowledged in studies concerning the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy; however, its role in exacerbating diabetic retinopathy has not received much attention. Ang II, indeed, plays a detrimental role in the progression of diabetic retinopathy by augmenting the principal events involved in its pathogenesis, namely oxidative stress, angiogenesis and inflammation. The utility of angiotensin receptor blockers has shown positive results in research studies and hence, might potentially provide a novel adjuvant therapy for treating this complication and preventing the associated vision-loss in diabetic patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It has been widely used as an effective treatment for DKD patients in China. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying SYFSF's renoprotection. In this study, we compared the protective effect of SYFSF to  on the histology and renal cells in type 2 DKD rat model and high-glucose (HG) cultured mesangial cells, respectively. We found that SYFSF could significantly decrease urinary albumin, cholesterol, and triglyceride. And a decrease in serum creatinine was also found in SYFSF-treated group compared with -treated rats. In addition, SYFSF inhibited the interstitial expansion and glomerulosclerosis in diabetic rats. Notably, SYFSF markedly downregulated the expression of MCP-1, TGF-1, collagen IV, and fibronectin in diabetic rat models and HG-induced mesangial cell models. The renoprotection was closely associated with a reduced expression of TNF- and phosphorylated NF-Bp65. Our study suggests that SYFSF may ameliorate diabetic kidney injury.

The primary end-point was time to onset of diabetic nephropathy. Samples from a subgroup from the placebo and the 300 mg  treatment group were used in this post-hoc analysis (n = 269, 68 %). Nine biomarkers were analysed: high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), fibrinogen, von Willebrand Factor (vWf), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), sE-selectin, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and AGE peptides. Mean standard deviation scores (Z-scores) were used to combine biomarker information.In a Cox enter model with combined Z-scores for biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction (vWf, sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, sE-selectin) and for biomarkers of inflammation (hs-CRP, IL-6, fibrinogen), endothelial dysfunction (hazard ratio for a 28 % increase ( = 1 SD) in Z-score) 3.20 (1.56 to 6.56), p = 0.001) and UAER (HR for a 75 % increase ( = 1 SD) in UAER) 2.61 (1.30 to 5.23), p = 0.007) were found as independent predictors.

Till now, the mechanism underlying such relation is largely unknown. We explored the hypothesis that exposure of cardiomyocytes to AT-II caused activation of MAO-A and also of catalase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities, enzymes involved in degrading MAO's end products. Left ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated from normoglycemic (N) and streptozotocin-injected (50 mg/kg) rats (D) treated or not treated with losartan (20 mg/kg/day in drinking water; DLos and NLos, respectively), a type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist, for 3 weeks. In each group of cells, MAO, catalase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities were measured radiochemically and spectrophotometrically. The same enzymes were also measured in HL-1 immortalized cardiomyocytes not exposed and exposed to AT-II (100 nM for 18 h) in the absence and in the presence of  (1 μM), an AT1 antagonist. MAO-A catalase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities were found significantly higher in D, than in N cells. MAO-A positively correlated with catalase activity in D cells. MAO-A and aldehyde dehydrogenase but not catalase over-activation, were prevented in DLos cells. Similarly, MAO-A activity, but not catalase and aldehyde dehydrogenase increased significantly in HL-1 cells acutely exposed to AT-II and this increase was prevented when , an AT1 antagonist was present. Over-activation of cardiomyocyte MAO-A activity is among acute (18 h) and short-term (2-weeks of ) cardiac effects of AT-II and a novel target of AT1 antagonists, first line treatments of diabetic cardiomyopathy.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Since the individual blood pressure and albuminuria response to an ARB varies between and within an individual, we tested whether the variability and discordance in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and albuminuria response to ARB therapy are associated with its long-term effect on cardiovascular outcomes.The combined data of the RENAAL and IDNT trials were used. We first investigated the extent of variability and discordance in SBP and albuminuria response (baseline to 6 months). Subsequently, we assessed the combined impact of residual Month 6 SBP and albuminuria level with cardiovascular outcome. In ARB-treated patients, 421 patients (34.5%) either had a reduction in SBP but no reduction in albuminuria, or vice versa, indicating substantial discordance in response in these parameters. The initial reduction in SBP and albuminuria independently correlated with cardiovascular protection: HR per 5 mmHg SBP reduction 0.97 (95% CI 0.94-0.99) and HR per decrement log albuminuria 0.87 (95% CI 0.76-0.99). Across all SBP categories at Month 6, a progressively lower cardiovascular risk was observed with a lower albuminuria level. This was particularly evident in patients who reached the guideline recommended SBP target of ≤130 mmHg.The SBP and albuminuria response to ARB therapy is variable and discordant. Therapies intervening in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with the aim of improving cardiovascular outcomes may therefore require a dual approach targeting both blood pressure and albuminuria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24065095>Potential of the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) telmisartan, , and candesartan for inhibiting the HMGB1/RAGE axis in prevention and acute treatment of stroke.</a></h1><p>Stroke is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide. The main cause of stroke is atherosclerosis, and the most common risk factor for atherosclerosis is hypertension. Therefore, antihypertensive treatments are recommended for the prevention of stroke. Three angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), telmisartan,  and candesartan, inhibit the expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), which is one of the pleiotropic effects of these drugs. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is the ligand of RAGE, and has been recently identified as a lethal mediator of severe sepsis. HMGB1 is an intracellular protein, which acts as an inflammatory cytokine when released into the extracellular milieu. Extracellular HMGB1 causes multiple organ failure and contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, , atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and stroke. This is the first review of the literature evaluating the potential of three ARBs for the HMGB1-RAGE axis on stroke therapy, including prevention and acute treatment. This review covers clinical and experimental studies conducted between 1976 and 2013. We propose that ARBs, which inhibit the HMGB1/RAGE axis, may offer a novel option for prevention and acute treatment of stroke. However, additional clinical studies are necessary to verify the efficacy of ARBs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021475>Dendrobium candidum protects against diabetic kidney lesions through regulating vascular endothelial growth factor, Glucose Transporter 1, and connective tissue growth factor expression in rats.</a></h1><p> (DM) remains a great health problem with approximate 30% of patients with DM eventually suffering from diabetic nephropathy. The search for exogenous protective factors has recently received wide attention. The current study aimed to investigate the protective effects of Dendrobium candidum (DC) on kidneys in diabetic rats. Initially, streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were established and randomly divided into the model group, DC group (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g/kg) and  group (17.5 mg/kg). The biochemical indexes, pathological changes, and the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), GLUT-1, and CTGF were examined. It was found that as compared with the model group, the kidney index, serum creatine, blood urea nitrogen, 24-hour urine protein, and VEGF of DC treatment groups were significantly decreased, and pathological changes in kidney were improved in the DC groups and  group ( P < 0.05 for each parameter). The protein and messenger RNA levels of GLUT-1 and CTGF in treatment groups were significantly lower than those in rats' renal cortex without treatment. Our data suggest that DC may protect the kidneys of diabetic rats via regulating expression of VEGF, GLUT-1, and CTGF.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24288364>Combining rosuvastatin with angiotensin-receptor blockers of different PPARγ-activating capacity: effects on high-density lipoprotein subfractions and associated enzymes.</a></h1><p>The effects of combining angiotensin-receptor blockers of different peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-activating capacity with rosuvastatin on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions and associated enzymes in patients with mixed dyslipidemia, hypertension, and prediabetes were assessed.

This study explored the renal protective effect and possible mechanism of gliquidone in mice with diabetic nephropathy.Animal model of diabetic nephropathy was established in KKAy mice. The renal protective effect of gliquidone was studied by evaluating the kidney function through measures of urinary protein, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr) and serum triglyceride (TG) that were performed using an automatic biochemical analyzer. The levels of oxidative stress indicators, such as nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), were evaluated in renal tissue homogenates using the automatic biochemical analyzer. The inhibitory effect of gliquidone on renal interstitial fibrosis and its association with Notch / Snail1 signaling pathway in diabetic nephropathy was investigated using molecular biological techniques.It was found that low-, medium- and high-dose gliquidone improved the mice's general health condition, such as mental status, fur condition, eating, and drinking. Gliquidone reduced the body weight and the kidney weight /body weight ratio of mice. Gliquidone improved the kidney function, indicated by reductions in urinary protein, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine and triglyceride. Gliquidone treatment increased levels of nitric oxide and superoxide dismutase, but decreased level of malondialdehyde. The expression of Jagged1/Notch1/hes1/Snail1/α-SMA decreased, while the expression of E-cadherin increased in gliquidone-treated kidneys. High dose gliquidone showed the best effect, one that was similar to that of the positive control drug .Taken together, our results suggested that gliquidone can ameliorate the diabetic symptoms of diabetic nephropathy through inhibiting Notch / Snail1 signaling pathway, improving anti -oxidative response and delaying renal interstitial fibrosis.

We categorized the strength of evidence about the CE of an intervention as strong, supportive, or uncertain. CEs were classified as cost saving (more health benefit at a lower cost), very cost-effective (<or=$25,000 per life year gained [LYG] or quality-adjusted life year [QALY]), cost-effective ($25,001 to $50,000 per LYG or QALY), marginally cost-effective ($50,001 to $100,000 per LYG or QALY), or not cost-effective (>$100,000 per LYG or QALY). The CE classification of an intervention was reported separately by country setting (U.S. or other developed countries) if CE varied by where the intervention was implemented. Costs were measured in 2007 U.S. dollars.Fifty-six studies from 20 countries met the inclusion criteria. A large majority of the ADA recommended interventions are cost-effective. We found strong evidence to classify the following interventions as cost saving or very cost-effective: (I) Cost saving- 1) ACE inhibitor (ACEI) therapy for intensive hypertension control compared with standard hypertension control; 2) ACEI or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy to prevent end-stage renal disease (ESRD) compared with no ACEI or ARB treatment; 3) early  therapy (at the microalbuminuria stage) to prevent ESRD compared with later treatment (at the macroalbuminuria stage); 4) comprehensive foot care to prevent ulcers compared with usual care; 5) multi-component interventions for diabetic risk factor control and early detection of complications compared with conventional insulin therapy for persons with type 1 ; and 6) multi-component interventions for diabetic risk factor control and early detection of complications compared with standard glycemic control for persons with type 2 . (II) Very cost-effective- 1) intensive lifestyle interventions to prevent type 2  among persons with impaired glucose tolerance compared with standard lifestyle recommendations; 2) universal opportunistic screening for undiagnosed type 2  in African Americans between 45 and 54 years old; 3) intensive glycemic control as implemented in the UK Prospective  Study in persons with newly diagnosed type 2  compared with conventional glycemic control; 4) statin therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease compared with no statin therapy; 5) counseling and treatment for smoking cessation compared with no counseling and treatment; 6) annual screening for diabetic retinopathy and ensuing treatment in persons with type 1  compared with no screening; 7) annual screening for diabetic retinopathy and ensuing treatment in persons with type 2  compared with no screening; and 8) immediate vitrectomy to treat diabetic retinopathy compared with deferred vitrectomy.Many interventions intended to prevent/control  are cost saving or very cost-effective and supported by strong evidence.

We described the incidence of stroke in HF-PEF patients with and without AF and predictors of stroke in those without AF.We pooled data from the CHARM-Preserved and I-Preserve trials. Using Cox regression, we derived a model for stroke in patients without AF in this cohort and compared its performance with a published model in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF)-predictive variables: age, body mass index, New York Heart Association class, history of stroke, and insulin-treated . The two stroke models were compared and Kaplan-Meier curves for stroke estimated. The risk model was validated in a third HF-PEF trial. Of the 6701 patients, 4676 did not have AF. Stroke occurred in 124 (6.1%) with AF and in 171 (3.7%) without AF (rates 1.80 and 1.00 per 100 patient-years, respectively). There was no difference in performance of the stroke model derived in the HF-PEF cohort and the published HF-REF model (c-index 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.57-0.84 vs. 0.73, 0.59-0.85, respectively) as the predictive variables overlapped. The model performed well in the validation cohort (0.86, 0.62-0.99). The rate of stroke in patients in the upper third of risk approximated to that in patients with AF (1.60 and 1.80 per 100 patient-years, respectively).A small number of clinical variables identify a subset of patients with HF-PEF, but without AF, at elevated risk of stroke.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

In addition, angiotensin (Ang) II is able to induce insulin resistance and an inflammatory state through Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1R). Accordingly, we examined whether inhibition of AT1R with  (IRB) can protect against the development of insulin resistance in obese Zucker rats (OZRs). IRB-treatment improved the insulin-stimulated insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylation at tyrosine (Tyr) residues 1158, 1162, 1163 (involved in activation of the IR kinase) and at Tyr972 (involved in substrate recognition). AT1R blockade also originated a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. This was accompanied by a decrease in phosphorylation of IR on serine (Ser) 994, a residue that seems to be implicated in the regulation of IR kinase in OZR. In this study, we demonstrated that Ser994 of IR is a direct substrate for TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a new member of the IKK-related kinase family. TBK1 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with the IR, in the liver of OZR supporting an in vivo association between the IR and TBK1. Interestingly, a marked increase in the association between TBK1 and the IR was found in the liver of OZR as well as in other models of insulin resistance/.

Angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARBs) are effective antihypertensive drugs that have been reported to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) to differing extents, with favorable effects on glucose metabolism and the incidence of new-onset . Among the ARBs, telmisartan is a partial activator of PPARgamma,  is a weak partial activator, and olmesartan has no effect on PPARgamma activation.The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects on glucose homeostasis of combining rosuvastatin with ARBs of varying PPARgamma-activating potency in Greek adults with impaired fasting glucose, mixed dyslipidemia, and stage 1 hypertension.This was a 24-week, randomized, open-label study. Inclusion criteria were impaired fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (100-125 mg/dL [5.6-6.9 mmol/L]), mixed dyslipidemia (LDL-C >160 mg/dL [4.14 mmol/L] and triglycerides >150 mg/dL [1.69 mmol/L]), and stage 1 hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140-159 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90-99 mm Hg).

The primary end point was change in the following indices of glucose metabolism after 6 months of treatment: FPG, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), HOMA of beta-cell function (HOMA-B), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)). Secondary end points included changes in anthropometric variables, blood pressure, serum lipids, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Tolerability was monitored throughout the study.After the 12-week dietary intervention, 151 white patients (78 female, 73 male) met the inclusion criteria and were randomized to receive RT (n = 52), RI (n = 48), or RO (n = 51). The mean (SD) age of the 3 groups was 60 (10), 60 (10), and 58 (12) years, respectively; their mean weight was 79 (11), 81 (12), and 78 (11) kg. At 6 months, the RT group had a 29% decrease in HOMA-IR (from a median [range] of 2.6 [0.6-6.6] to 1.8 [0.5-5.1]), the RI group had a 16% increase (from 2.5 [0.5-6.2] to 2.9 [0.5-8.1]), and the RO group had a 14% increase (from 2.4 [0.5-7.9] to 2.7 [0.5-5.2]) (all, P < 0.05 vs baseline). The improvement in the RT group was statistically significant compared with the RI group (P < 0.01) and the RO group (P < 0.05). The changes from baseline in FPG and HbA(1c) were not significant in any group. Fasting serum insulin decreased by 21% in the RT group (from 10.4 [2.4-28.1] to 8.2 [2.4-18.8] microU/mL), whereas it increased by 12% in the RI group (from 9.1 [2.0-26.5] to 10.2 [2.0-25.2] microU/mL) and by 8% in the RO group (from 10.1 [2.0-29.6] to 10.9 [2.0-19.1] microU/mL) (all, P < 0.05 vs baseline). Again, there was a significant difference between the RT group and the RI group (P < 0.01) and RO group (P < 0.05). Levels of hs-CRP decreased by 44% in the RT group (from 2.2 [0.3-7.9] to 1.2 [0.4-7.0] mg/L), by 12% in the RI group (from 2.2 [0.3-12.3] to 1.9 [0.2-11.4] mg/L), and by 22% in the RO group (from 2.1 [0.7-4.0] to 1.7 [0.7-6.2] mg/L). The difference was statistically significant for the RT group compared with baseline and with the RI and RO groups (all comparisons, P < 0.05). Blood pressure was significantly reduced from baseline in all 3 groups, with no significant differences between groups. No serious adverse events were reported during the study, nor were there any clinically significant elevations in aminotransferases or creatine kinase.In this small, randomized, open-label study, the RT combination had favorable effects on HOMA-IR, fasting serum insulin, and hs-CRP compared with the RI and RO combinations in Greek adults with impaired fasting glucose, mixed hyperlipidemia, and stage 1 hypertension.Copyright  2010 Excerpta Medica Inc.

Further, we sought to elucidate the correlation between VEGF level and certain clinical parameters, such as albumin excretion rate (AER), before and after treatment with angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker.We recruited 166 type 2 diabetic patients at various stages of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and 46 healthy control subjects for a cross-sectional study. We recruited another 42 hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria for a longitudinal study involving a 6-month  treatment protocol. Urinary VEGF (uVEGF) levels were determined using ELISA.In the cross-sectional study, hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients who received RAS inhibitor presented lower uVEGF levels than those who did not receive the RAS inhibitor. Statistical analysis indicated that uVEGF level was independently correlated with the AER. In the longitudinal study involving the 6-month  treatment, we demonstrated that uVEGF levels decreased significantly in patients who achieved a 50% AER reduction (remission group, n=32). In contrast, uVEGF levels remained unchanged in patients who did not exhibit a 50% AER reduction (nonremission group, n=10). Furthermore, the change in uVEGF was significantly correlated with the change in AER (r=0.65, P<0.01) before and after 6 months of  treatment. This result held true even after we had adjusted for the decrease in average blood pressure.The protective effect of the RAS inhibitor in DN patients is associated with the suppression of VEGF. Accordingly, it may be possible to use uVEGF as a marker of DN progression.

Increasing the number of study eligibility criteria identifies a progressively smaller group of patients from real-life practice suitable for recruitment into clinical trials; using the J-DHF criteria, 81% of our clinic patients would have been eligible, whereas the PARAGON-HF criteria significantly reduced this proportion to 32%. The patients identified from our clinical population had similar mortality rates using the different criteria, which were consistently higher than those reported in the actual clinic trials.Trial eligibility criteria have become stricter with time, which reduces the number of eligible patients, affecting both generalizability of any findings and feasibility of completing an adequately powered trial. We could not find evidence that the additional criteria used in more recent randomized trials in HFpEF have identified patients at higher risk of all-cause mortality.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

After a 1-month washout period, 26 patients with type 2 , hypertension, and albuminuria (>100 mg/day) were randomly assigned to four 2-month treatment periods in random order with placebo, 300 mg aliskiren once daily, 300 mg  once daily, or the combination using identical doses. Patients received furosemide in a stable dose throughout the study. The primary end point was a change in albuminuria. Secondary measures included change in 24-h blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).Placebo geometric mean albuminuria was 258 mg/day (range 84-2,361), mean +/- SD 24-h blood pressure was 140/73 +/- 15/8 mmHg, and GFR was 89 +/- 27 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Aliskiren treatment reduced albuminuria by 48% (95% CI 27-62) compared with placebo (P < 0.001), not significantly different from the 58% (42-79) reduction with  treatment (P < 0.001 vs. placebo). Combination treatment reduced albuminuria by 71% (59-79), more than either monotherapy (P < 0.001 and P = 0.028). Fractional clearances of albumin were significantly reduced (46, 56, and 67% reduction vs. placebo). Twenty-four-hour blood pressure was reduced 3/4 mmHg by aliskiren (NS/P = 0.009), 12/5 mmHg by  (P < 0.001/P = 0.002), and 10/6 mmHg by the combination (P = 0.001/P < 0.001).

Exclusion criteria included economic evaluations of ARBs for other indications (e.g. heart failure, myocardial infarction, etc.), an underage population, as well as prevalence studies of hypertension for a disease-specific population.Of the 63 studies retrieved in the literature search, 35 were included in the review. The majority of the studies were of  (16) or losartan (8). In each study, the model used country-specific data to project and evaluate the clinical and cost outcomes of the treatment arms. The most common method undertaken was cost-consequence analysis (52.94%) followed by cost-effectiveness analysis (32.35%). In most cases, costs and benefits results were not synthesised. Results failed to show a clear advantage in favour of specific therapy, as the outcomes suffered from heterogeneity, referred to specific circumstances and were rather difficult to compare. For different treatment comparators, all the analyses demonstrated an improved life expectancy and a cost-saving choice. The robustness of results was tested with a series of sensitivity analyses, which showed a statistically significant result in each case.The evidence from this review suggests that the available ARBs represent a cost-saving and cost-effective treatment compared with other conventional treatment options for patients with hypertension and associated conditions. However, there are no meaningful differences between available ARBs, as the design of clinical and economic studies makes it difficult to find any such differences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27653164>Fixed-dose combination of zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide vs.  plus hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients with established metabolic syndrome uncontrolled by previous monotherapy.

Diabetic nephropathy is typically characterized by persistent microalbuminuria progressing to nephrotic syndrome, a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate, and hypertension. Diabetic nephropathy prevention strategies may involve early angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment and the control of  to reduce glomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration. Treatment strategies include the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and cholesterol-lowering agents. Early intervention is key to the prevention of more severe renal outcomes.

Diabetic rats were treated with  (50 mg/kg/d) by gavage for 8 weeks. Nondiabetic normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats, which have the same genetic background as spontaneously hypertensive rat, were used as controls. The renal histological changes were investigated by light and electron microscopy. The epithelial marker of nephrin and mesenchymal marker of desmin were detected by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.Compared with controls, diabetic rats were associated with mesangial matrix deposition, thickening of glomerular basement membrane, albuminuria, loss of podocytes and effacement of foot processes. Furthermore, the expression of nephrin was significantly reduced whereas desmin was increased.  treatment not only lowered blood pressure and albuminuria but also attenuated podocyte loss, maintenance of nephrin expression and inhibition of desmin expression.This study demonstrates that early  intervention attenuates the podocyte damage and ameliorates phenotypic alterations of podocytes, which provides a novel insight for the early application of angiotensin receptor blocker to prevent the development of DN.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25046956>[Effect of Chinese herbs for stasis removing and collaterals dredging upon angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-angiotensin-(1-7)-mas axis in the renal cortex of diabetic nephropathy rats].</a></h1><p>To observe the effect of Chinese herbs for stasis removing and collaterals dredging (CHSRCD) upon angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas axis in the renal cortex of diabetic nephropathy rats.Totally 89 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the blank control group (C group, n=22), the high-glucose high-fat control group (H group, n=10), and the streptozotocin (STZ)-injecting group (n=57).

The (P)RR is an accessory protein of vacuolar-type H⁺-ATPase (V-ATPase) and is required for V-ATPase integrity. In addition, in collecting duct cells, prorenin-induced activation of Erk depends on V-ATPase activity. However, whether prorenin binding to the (P)RR directly regulates V-ATPase activity is as yet unknown. Here, we studied the effect of prorenin on plasma membrane V-ATPase activity in Madin-Darby canine kidney clone 11 (MDCK.C11) cells, which resemble intercalated cells of the collecting duct. Prorenin increased V-ATPase activity at low nanomolar concentrations, and the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, but not the angiotensin II type 1 and 2 receptor blockers  and PD-123319, prevented this. Increased, but not basal, V-ATPase activity was abolished by small interfering RNA depletion of the (P)RR. Unexpectedly, the putative peptidic (P)RR blocker handle region peptide also increased V-ATPase activity in a (P)RR-dependent manner. Finally, [Arg⁸]-vasopressin-stimulated V-ATPase activity and cAMP production were also abolished by (P)RR depletion.

Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) has anabolic bone effects on the physicochemical properties of the bone in . We hypothesized that ARB could inhibit AGEs-induced deleterious effects.In this study, we chose seven-week-old Leprdb/Lepr+ (db/+) and Leprdb/Leprdb (db/db) mice. After 12 week intervention by , the microarchitecture and mechanical strength of the bone of seven-week-old db/db mice were investigated systematically. Meanwhile, the molecular mechanisms of the osteoblasts were analyzed, after AGEs or  were added to the culture. Also, intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured with DCF fluorescence.Results showed that 12-week  treatment could dramatically improve trabecular bone microarchitecture through increasing BV/TV (p = 0.003, +46.7%), Tb.N (p = 0.020, +52.0%), and decreasing that of Tb.Sp (p = 0.005, -21.2%) and SMI (p = 0.007, -26.4%), comparing with the db/db group.  could also substantially raise biomechanical parameters including max load (p = 0.013, +20.7%), fracture load (p = 0.014, +70.5%), energy absorption (p = 0.019, +99.4%). Besides, it could inhibit AGEs-induced damage of cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts, as well as suppressing the activation of apoptosis caused by AGEs. Moreover, co-incubation with  could prevent the AGEs-induced increase of intracellular oxidative stress and RAGE expression in osteoblasts.In conclusion, this study suggested that  might play a protective role in -related bone damages by blocking the deleterious effects of AGEs/RAGE-mediated oxidative stress.

The current study was carried out to assess the protective effect of XKP in spontaneous diabetic db/db mice and the underlying mechanism whereby XKP regulates TGF-/Smad pathway. Male C57BLKS/J db/db mice, 12 weeks old, were randomly divided into 3 groups: the model group, 17.5 mg/kg -treated group (IST group), and 8 g/kg XKP-treated group (XKP group), while age-matched db/m mice were selected as a control group. After 8 weeks of administration, serum and urea samples were collected from mice for biochemical tests, while the kidneys were removed for histological analysis. The expression of TGF-/Smad pathway-related mRNA and protein were measured by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Treatment with XKP significantly improved renal function and attenuated the pathological change of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in renal histopathology. Furthermore, the overexpression of TGF-1, Smad3, and p-Smad3 was inhibited, as well as the reduction of Smad7 and SIP1 was weakened by XKP.

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) that specifically block the AT(1) receptor offer the potential to prevent or delay progression to end-stage renal disease independently of reductions in blood pressure. Proteinuria--an early and sensitive marker for progressive renal dysfunction--is reduced by ARB use in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy and microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. Retrospective analysis of data available from early trials has confirmed this finding and has shown that albuminuria reduction is associated with lessening of cardiovascular risk. The ARB telmisartan is equivalent to enalapril in preventing glomerular filtration rate decline, and equivalent to valsartan in reducing proteinuria. Telmisartan is more effective than conventional therapy in lowering the risk of transition to overt nephropathy in hypertensive and normotensive patients. An additive effect has been seen in smaller studies when telmisartan has been added to lisinopril therapy, and high-dose telmisartan reduces albuminuria better than low-dose telmisartan. Similar data were obtained with other ARBs such as candesartan, losartan, valsartan, or . These data support the proposition that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system beyond that required for maximum blood pressure reduction provides optimum renal protection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26250359>Characterization of subgroups of heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction with possible implications for prognosis and treatment response.</a></h1><p>Patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) have a poor prognosis, and no therapies have been proven to improve outcomes. It has been proposed that heart failure, including HFpEF, represents overlapping syndromes that may have different prognoses. We present an exploratory study of patients enrolled in the  in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction Study (I-PRESERVE) using latent class analysis (LCA) with validation using the Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM)-Preserved study to identify HFpEF subgroups.In total, 4113 HFpEF patients randomized to  or placebo were characterized according to 11 clinical features.

Yet RAS blockers have only limited beneficial effects on progression of DR in clinical trials. The natriuretic peptide system offsets RAS, so that enhancing the activity of this system on top of RAS blockade might be beneficial. Neprilysin has an important role in the degradation of natriuretic peptides. Therefore, we hypothesize that dual angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibition (ARNI) may outperform angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in protection against DR. We tested this hypothesis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic transgenic (mRen2)27 rats.Adult male diabetic (mRen2)27 rats were followed for 5 or 12 weeks. Treatment with vehicle,  (ARB), or ARB combined with the neprilysin inhibitor thiorphan (+thiorphan [ARNI]) occurred during the final 3 weeks. Retinal cell death, gliosis, and capillary loss were evaluated. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses were performed to quantify the retinal level of inflammatory cell markers.Both ARB- and ARNI-treated groups showed similarly reduced retinal apoptotic cell death, gliosis, and capillary loss compared to the vehicle-treated group in the 5-week study. Treatment with ARNI reduced the expression of inflammatory markers more than ARB treatment in the 5-week study. In the 12-week study, ARNI treatment showed significantly more reduction in apoptotic cell death (51% vs. 25% reduction), and capillary loss (68% vs. 43% reduction) than ARB treatment.Treatment with ARNI provides better protection against DR in diabetic (mRen2)27 transgenic rats, compared to ARB alone.

Our data showed that TLR4 and MyD88 were up-regulated significantly in high glucose and AngII-induced MCs; meanwhile, NF-κB as well as MCP-1, IL-6 were also highly expressed. In cells that were transfected with TLR4 SiRNA，the parameters were greatly inhibited; similar effects were detected in cells that were treated with . We concluded that Ang II synergized with high glucose in the release of pro-inflammatory factors mainly through the upregulation of TLR4 signaling in MCs, Cross-talk between Ang II and TLR4 contributed to the MC inflammatory injury under high glucose conditions.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

After 1 week, two groups, one of which receiving losartan, were injected in the tail vein with citrate buffer (normoglycemic, N and normoglycemic, losartan-treated, NL). The remaining received a single injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg in citrate i.v.) thus becoming diabetic (D) and diabetic losartan-treated (DL). Plasma glycaemia and blood pressure were measured in all animals before the sacrifice (15 days after  induction).In aortic strips isolated from N, NL, D and DL rats we evaluated i) the isometric concentration-dependent contractile response to phenylephrine (Phe) and to AT-II; ii) the RhoA-kinase (ROCK1) activity and expression by enzyme-immunoassay and Western blot respectively.The concentration-dependent contractile effect of Phe was similar in aortas from all groups, whereas at all concentrations tested, AT-II contraction efficacy was 2 and half and 1 and half times higher in D and DL respectively in comparison with N and NL. AT-II contracture was similarly reduced in all groups by AT-II receptor antagonists,  or  plus PD123319.

ROCK1 activity and expression were higher in D than in N/NL and DL aortas.Aortas isolated from STZ-rats present hyper-contracture to AT-II mainly dependent on the up-regulation of ROCK1 expression/activity. In vivo losartan treatment partially corrects AT-II hyper-contracture, limiting the increase in ROCK1 expression/activity.

All patients had uncontrolled BP before initiating one of the index therapies (SPCs: valsartan/amlodipine or valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ], FCs: ARB + calcium channel blocker [CCB] or ARB + HCTZ) between 07/2008 and 06/2009. Up to three BP measures were collected starting from 45 days after the therapy initiation. BP goal was <130/80 mmHg for patients with , chronic renal disease or coronary heart disease; or <140/90 mmHg for patients without these comorbidities. The Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test was used to compare rates of BP goal achievement associated with valsartan-based SPCs vs. ARB-based FCs over time. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the likelihood of BP goal achievement associated with SPCs vs. FCs, controlling for demographics, baseline BP, hypertension history, comorbidities, prior and concurrent use of anti-hypertensive medications, and physician specialty.The study included 812 patients: 414 on valsartan-based SPCs (209 on valsartan/amlodipine and 205 on valsartan/HCTZ) and 398 on ARB-based FCs (200 on ARB + CCB and 198 on ARB + HCTZ). The ARBs in the FC group included valsartan, losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan,  and candesartan.

The binding of circulatory AGEs or AGEs included in erythrocyte membrane to the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) generates in endothelial cells an oxidative stress and enhances the expression of inflammatory molecules. Engagement of RAGE by AGEs and subsequent signaling plays an important role in the development of diabetic complications. Soluble RAGE isoforms (sRAGE) neutralize the ligand-mediated damage by acting as a decoy. If the expression of RAGE is upregulated during the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, sRAGE mostly found decreased when complications ensue. By modulating RAGE isoform expression, it could be possible to reduce the incidence of complications. This review focused on the capability of Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), which are used to treat patients with hypertension and/or , to modulate RAGE isoform expression because some data reported the interference with RAGE downstream. In this regard, three ARBs - , telmisartan, candesartan cilexetil - were tested and provided evidence for their ability to inhibit in human endothelial cells the expression of membrane-bound and soluble RAGE isoforms induced by the inflammatory factor Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), demonstrating the potential benefits of these molecules in RAGE-oriented therapies. Modulating RAGE isoforms expression by correcting endothelial dysfunction is achievable by drugs already used for hypertension or  treatment such as ARBs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25350224>Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of the DPP-4 inhibitor gemigliptin when coadministered with rosuvastatin or  to healthy subjects.</a></h1><p>Gemigliptin is a selective DPP4 inhibitor used to treat type 2 .

Subsequently, we analyzed the individual effect of both response parameters on renal outcome defined as change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during 2 years of follow-up.The median reductions in UAE and SBP in the population were -18% and -11 mmHg, respectively. In -treated patients, 85 (24.4%) had a robust (>median) reduction in UAE but not in SBP (discordant SBP response) and 67 (19.3%) had a robust (>median) reduction in SBP but not in UAE (discordant UAE response). The degree of reduction in UAE was independently associated with the rate of eGFR decline (P = 0.0037). SBP showed a similar trend (P = 0.087). The relation between a larger UAE reduction and a slower rate of renal function decline was present in both cohorts with a SBP change above and below the median.Within an individual, UAE response to ARB therapy may be discordant from SBP response. The initial change in UAE was independently associated with eGFR slope; the more UAE reduction the less eGFR decline, irrespective of the SBP change.

Serum chemerin levels are significantly elevated in type 2  patients with macroalbuminuria. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We conducted a preliminary investigation of the effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on chemerin expression in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were randomized into control, diabetic, and -treated groups. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect mRNA expression of chemerin, angiotensin II type 1a receptor (AT1a), angiotensin II type 1b receptor (AT1b) and angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2). Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect chemerin in renal tissues.Expression levels of chemerin in renal tissues were significantly elevated in the diabetic group compared to the control group.

Levels of NPs higher than certain cutoffs are often used as inclusion criteria in clinical trials of HFpEF to increase the likelihood that patients have HF and to select patients at higher risk for events. Whether treatments have a differential effect on outcomes across the spectrum of NP levels is unclear.The TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial) trial randomized patients with HFpEF and either prior hospitalization for HF or elevated natriuretic peptide levels (B-type NP [BNP] ≥100 pg/ml or N-terminal proBNP ≥360 pg/ml) to spironolactone or placebo. Baseline BNP (n = 430) or N-terminal proBNP (n = 257) levels were available in 687 patients enrolled from the Americas in the elevated-NP stratum of TOPCAT.Higher levels of NPs were independently associated with an increased risk for TOPCAT's primary endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF when analyzed either continuously or grouped by terciles, adjusting for region of enrollment, age, sex, atrial fibrillation, , renal function, body mass index, and heart rate. There was a significant interaction between the effect of spironolactone and baseline NP terciles for the primary outcome (p = 0.017), with greater benefit of the drug in the lower compared with higher NP terciles.Similar to the effects of  in the I-PRESERVE ( in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) trial, a greater benefit of spironolactone was observed in the group with lower levels of NPs and overall risk in TOPCAT. Elevated NPs in HFpEF identify patients at higher risk for events but who may be less responsive to treatment.

Huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from AM, has been proved clinically effective in improving renal inflammation and glomerular injury in CKD. However, the mechanisms of HKC are still not fully understood.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α/γ dual agonists have the potential to be used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2  and diabetic nephropathy (DN). This study evaluated the function of Huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic (AM), as a dual agonist for PPARα/γ and investigated its anti-DN effects in a DN rat model.ChIP and reporter gene assays were performed and the expression of PPARα/γ target genes was monitored to examine the ability of HKC to activate PPARα/γ. DN was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats via unilateral nephrectomy and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. HKC was administered to the diabetic nephropathy rats at three different doses: high dose HKC (300mg/kg/d); middle dose HKC (175mg/kg/d); and low dose HKC (75mg/kg/d).  (4mg/kg/d body weight) was used as a positive control. Following 12 weeks' treatment, we measured general status, renal morphological appearance, proteinuria, blood biochemical parameters, and glomerular morphological changes. The expression of collagen IV, TGFβ, TNFα and IL-6 in renal tissue was evaluated. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in renal tissue was also analyzed.HKC enhanced the transcriptional activity of PPARα and PPARγ in cultured cells, livers and kidneys of DN rats, and it reduced serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels and fat in livers of DN rats. Furthermore, HKC reduced the expressions of inflammatory genes in kidneys of DN rats. Strikingly, HKC reduced ER stress and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation in the liver and kidney of DN rats and subsequently improved renal injury.Our results show that HKC improved lipid metabolic disorders by activating PPARα/γ and attenuating ER stress. HKC could dose-dependently ameliorate renal inflammation and glomerular injury in DN rats. These results suggest that HKC has potential as an anti-DN agent for the treatment of DN in humans.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We used different complementary techniques to gain a clear picture of the involved protonation and complexation equilibria. The low solubility in water of the ligands and of the formed metal complexes prevented the use of water as solvent, so we had to perform the measurements in mixed methanol-water solvents. Further, we studied the related equilibria with Zn for evaluating a potential interference of this essential metal ion, largely present in biological fluids. Our study provided a strong evaluation of the formed complexes and of the relative stability constants. The binding of both metal ions takes place through the tetrazole moiety except for the Zn- system. In this last case, NMR measurements gave evidence of a tautomeric equilibrium involving the imidazole ring and the aliphatic chain. The estimated complexation model, and the related stability constants, allowed a speciation study in human plasma, based on a number of simplifying assumptions, which remarked that both drugs, Losartan and , could exert a chelating action, scavenging non-negligible amounts of Cu from the organism.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Paradoxically, in HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF), a high body mass index (BMI) appears to be beneficial. Approximately 50% of HF patients have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFPEF). However, there are few data regarding the relationship between BMI and outcomes in HFPEF.Baseline characteristics and cardiovascular outcomes were assessed in the 4109 patients (mean age, 72 years; mean follow-up, 49.5 months) in the  in HF with Preserved Ejection Fraction (I-PRESERVE) trial. Based on the BMI distribution, 5 BMI categories were defined: <23.5, 23.5 to 26.4, 26.5 to 30.9, 31 to 34.9, and ≥35 kg/m(2). Most patients (71%) had a BMI ≥26.5, 21% had a BMI between 23.5 and 26.4, and 8% had a BMI <23.5 kg/m(2). Patients with higher BMI were younger, more often women, and more likely to have hypertension and  and higher left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients with BMI of 26.5 to 30.9 kg/m(2) had the lowest rate for the primary composite outcome (death or cardiovascular hospitalization) and were used as reference group. After adjustment for 21 risk variables including age, sex, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, the hazard ratio for the primary outcome was increased in patients with BMI <23.5 (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.56; P=0.019) and in those with BMI ≥35 kg/m(2) (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.52; P=0.011) compared with the referent group. A similar relationship was found for all-cause mortality and for HF hospitalization.Obesity is common in HFPEF patients and is accompanied by multiple differences in clinical characteristics. Independent of other key prognostic variables, there was a U-shaped relationship, with the greatest rate of adverse outcomes in the lowest and highest BMI categories.http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Wistar-Kyoto rats served as controls. The pathological changes were investigated by microscopy. Immunofluorescence was performed to evaluate the co-expression of CD31 and fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1). FSP1 and α-SMA expressions were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. EndMT was also studied in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) that had been exposed to high glucose (HG) levels.Increased interstitial fibrosis was detected in the DM group. Double labeling revealed CD31 expression in FSP1-positive cells in the DM group, and this expression was diminished by Irb treatment (P<0.05). In vitro, we found that HG stimulated angiotensin II synthesis in HAECs. When HAECs were exposed to HG, some of the cells acquired a spindle-shaped morphology and demonstrated a loss of CD31 labeling, which was attenuated by Irb treatment. FSP1 and α-SMA mRNA and protein expression levels were markedly upregulated in diabetic rats compared to controls, and their expressions were inhibited by Irb treatment (P<0.05).The results provide the novel insight that an angiotensin II receptor blocker might prevent diabetic cardiomyopathy by abrogating EndMT in diabetic rats.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We sought to determine angiotensin II- ATR participation on a diet-induced gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) experimental model. Female Wistar rats were fed with a standard or hypercaloric diet for 7 weeks. Half of the animals were mated and became pregnant from week 4-7. Animals were treated with saline,  (30 mg/kg) or metformin (320 mg/kg) for the last two weeks of the protocol. Weight gain, systolic blood pressure (BP), oral glucose tolerance test and vascular contractility were measured at the last day of the protocol (day 19-20 of pregnancy). Hypercaloric diet increased blood glucose, impaired glucose tolerance test, and increased BP in pregnant rats, fulfilling criteria for GDM. Both drugs decreased impaired GTT and relative hyperglycemia. Metformin had no effect on BP but prevented weight increase. In isolated aortas,  and metformin decreased vasoconstriction only of non-pregnant hypercaloric diet fed animals. Results support angiotensin II/ ATR involvement in BP and glucose homeostasis disturbances observed in present GDM model.

The NOCTURNE study, a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) using our recently developed information and communication technology (ICT) nocturnal home BP monitoring (HBPM) device, was performed to compare the nocturnal HBP-lowering effects of differential ARB-based combination therapies in 411 Japanese patients with nocturnal hypertension (HT).Methods and Results:Patients with nocturnal BP ≥120/70 mmHg at baseline even under ARB therapy (100 mg  daily) were enrolled. The ARB/CCB combination therapy ( 100 mg+amlodipine 5 mg) achieved a significantly greater reduction in nocturnal home systolic BP (primary endpoint) than the ARB/diuretic combination (daily  100 mg+trichlormethiazide 1 mg) (-14.4 vs. -10.5 mmHg, P<0.0001), independently of urinary sodium excretion and/or nocturnal BP dipping status. However, the change in nocturnal home systolic BP was comparable among the post-hoc subgroups with higher salt sensitivity (, chronic kidney disease, and elderly patients).This is the first RCT demonstrating the feasibility of clinical assessment of nocturnal BP by ICT-nocturnal HBPM. The ARB/CCB combination was shown to be superior to ARB/diuretic in patients with uncontrolled nocturnal HT independently of sodium intake, despite the similar impact of the 2 combinations in patients with higher salt sensitivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19627007>[Effect of ginsenoside Rgl on the expression of TNF-alpha and MCP-1 in rats with diabetic nephropathy].</a></h1><p>To investigate the effects of Ginsenoside Rgl on proteinuria and the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in rats with diabetic nephropathy (DN).The DN rat model was established by injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 65 mg/kg) in abdominal cavity. Forty Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal group, DN group, Ginsenoside Rgl treatment group and  treatment group. The blood glucose was monitored routinely. Twenty-four hours urine protein and serum creatine were measured the day before the rats were killed when the eight weeks of treatments had been completed. The renal pathological and podocyte changes were evaluated. Immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to examine the protein expression levels of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha, respectively. The mRNA of TNF-alpha and MCP-1 were reverse transcribed and quantified by real-time PCR.The DN rats had increased volume of renal glomerulus, thickened basement membrane, and increased mesenterium mass, as well as some inflammatory cells in renal glomerulus. The number of potocyte decreased significantly in the DN group compared with the normal group (P<0.01). Compared with the DN group, the basement membrane became thinning and the number of podocyte increased in the two treatment groups (P<0.05). The rats in the DN group and the two treatment groups had significantly higher levels of twenty-four hour urine protein, serum creatine, serum glucose, serum MCP-1 and TNF-alpha than the normal rats (P<0.05). The rats in the treatment groups had lower levels of twenty-four hours urine protein and serum creatine than the rats in the DN group (P<0.05). But the serum glucose had little changes (P>0.05). There was no difference between the two treatment groups. Immunohistochemisty, ELISA and real-time PCR results indicated that the expression levels of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha in the rats in the DN group and the two treatment groups were significantly higher than those in the normal group (P<0.05). The rats in the treatment groups had lower levels of expression of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha than those in the DN group (P<0.05). The correlation analysis indicated that the levels of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha were positively related to twenty-four hours urine protein (r=0.7802, 0.6963), glomerular sclerosis index (r=0.8296, 0.7413) and thickness of podocyte membrane (r=0.7678, 0.6701, P<0.05).Ginsenoside Rgl reduces the expression of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha, repairs the pathological lesions of podocyte and nephron, and reduces the twenty-four hour urine protein rats with diabetic nephropathy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22490812>[Triptolide combined with  synergistically blocks podocyte injury in a type 2  rat model].</a></h1><p>To investigate the protective effect of combination of triptolide and  on the podocytes in a type 2 diabetic(T2DM) rat model, and evaluate its mechanism.T2DM rats were induced by fed with high-sucrose-high-fat diet combined with a low dose of streptozocin.

Aliskiren was effective in controlling blood pressure (BP) as monotherapy and in combination with other antihypertensives, in large, randomized trials. Aliskiren 150-300 mg/day as monotherapy was effective in lowering BP across short- (≤12 weeks) and longer-term (up to 54 weeks) periods, providing sustained and consistent effects with 24-hour BP control. Compared with other antihypertensives, aliskiren was generally as effective as hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), valsartan, losartan,  and lisinopril in reducing BP. Furthermore, short-term aliskiren was noninferior to ramipril in reducing BP, but with a longer treatment duration, a greater efficacy of aliskiren-based therapy over ramipril-based therapy was demonstrated. Additional BP-lowering effects occurred when aliskiren was coadministered (as a fixed-dose combination or separate tablets) with other antihypertensives, including HCTZ, valsartan and amlodipine, according to large, randomized trials of short- (≤12 weeks) and longer-term (up to 54 weeks) duration. Combination therapy with aliskiren plus HCTZ was effective in hypertensive patients when administered as initial therapy or to patients previously treated with HCTZ or aliskiren monotherapy. Aliskiren-based therapy was also effective in lowering BP in obese patients, patients with type 1 or 2 , patients with metabolic syndrome and the elderly. Aliskiren efficacy was observed irrespective of patient age, sex or ethnicity. Aliskiren monotherapy or combination therapy was generally well tolerated over short- and longer-term study durations in large, randomized clinical trials. Clinical trials to evaluate the effects of aliskiren on clinical outcomes, including renoprotective and cardioprotective effects, are currently ongoing.

Patients were randomly divided into 4 groups: low-dose  (group A), high-dose  (group B), low-dose  combined with spironolactone (group C) and high-dose  combined with spironolactone (group D). Changes in UAER, serum potassium and blood pressure were compared.There were no statistical differences in the baseline characteristics among groups. Furthermore, no significant difference in blood pressure before and after treatment was found among different groups. After 72-week treatment, UAER in group D was lower compared to group A and B (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, compared with group B, UAER in group C decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Additionally, significantly higher serum potassium was found in group D compared to other groups (P < 0.05). Also, group D had the highest count of patients who withdrew from the study due to hyperkalemia compared to other groups (P < 0.05).Our results indicate high-dose  combined with spironolactone may be more efficient in reducing UAER in elderly patients with early DN, but this treatment could cause hyperkalemia.

We therefore compared the time to RRT with the time to a fixed eGFR threshold and assessed the effect of the renoprotective drug  on both components. analysis of two clinical trials, the  Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) and Reduction of End points in Non-insulin dependent  with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan Trial, in patients with type 2  and nephropathy. The time to a predefined eGFR level of 11 ml/min per 1.73 m (eGFR), calculated by within-patient linear regression, was compared with the time to RRT or sustained serum creatinine ≥6 mg/dl.A large difference was observed in the median time to RRT (779 days) compared with eGFR (678 days; =0.01). We also observed a large variation in the difference between the time to RRT and eGFR. In IDNT, the hazard ratio for the effect of  on the serum creatinine ≥6.0 mg/dl end point was 0.60 (95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.91; =0.02), whereas it was smaller for the RRT end point (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.58 to 1.07; =0.12).This study shows a difference in the time to RRT and a fixed eGFR threshold, and shows that the effect of an angiotensin receptor blocker on a filtration-based end point versus RRT varies. This implies that evaluating renoprotective effects of drugs with a combined RRT and doubling of serum creatinine end point may result in evaluating other effects beyond renoprotection alone. Future trials should consider registering all parameters that lead to RRT decisions.Copyright © 2017 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29931880>[The mechanism of  against  induced myocardial fibrosis in rat model].</a></h1><p>To observe the protective effect of  on myocardial fibrosis in diabetic rats, and analyze the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in this protection.Thirty two male SD rats were randomly divided into two groups:normal control group (CON, =10), experimental group (=22). Twenty diabetic rats which had modelled successfully were randomly divided into two groups:diabetic group (DM, =10),  + DM group (Ir+DM, =10). After 8 weeks, fasting blood glucose (FBG) level, body weight (BW), the ratio of heart weight/body weight (H/B) and left ventricular weight index (LVWI) were measured. The myocardial morphological and fibrotic changes were observed by Masson staining. Col I and col Ⅲ contents were evaluated using ELISA method, and the protein expressions of ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2 in heart tissue were tested by Western blot.Compared with CON group, in diabetic rats, the levels of FBG, H/B and LVWI were increased while BW was decreased.

After 6 weeks washout, the 3 groups were given TwHF (1-2 mg·kg⁻¹·d⁻¹),  (150-300 mg/d), and TwHF (1-2 mg·kg⁻¹·d⁻¹) combined with  (150-300 mg/d) for 12 weeks respectively. Fifteen healthy volunteers served as controls. Urinary podocytes were identified and quantitated by immunofluorescence staining of urinary sediments labeled by monoclonal antibody podocalyxin. In addition, we studied urinary connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), osteopontin (OPN) and transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) concentrations in DKD patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Urinary detached podocytes were obviously higher in the urine of DKD patients than in healthy controls (P < 0.01). Podocyte detection rate was 86.6% in the urine of DKD patients. The protein expressions of CTGF, OPN and TGFβ1 in patients with urinary podocyte were significantly increased than those without urinary podocyte (P < 0.05 or 0.01).Correlation analysis showed that there was positive correlation between urinary protein excretion and urinary podocytes (r = 0.79, P < 0.01) and there were positive correlations between the number of urinary podocytes and urinary protein expressions of CTGF, OPN and TGFβ₁ (r = 0.56, 0.41, 0.44, respectively, all P values <0.01).

The established successfully diabetic mice were randomly divided into the model group,  group [45 mg/ (kg?d)], low-, high-dose rutin groups [50, 100 mg/ (kg?d)]. The mice in the normal and the model groups were given sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution (CMC-Na, 1 g/L) by intragastric administration respectively. After administration for 8 weeks, the levels of creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in serum were detected by blood biochemical analyzer. The cardiac myocardial morphology was observed by HE staining, Masson trichrome staining and electron microscope.Compare to the normal group, the levels of the myocardial enzyme in serum evidently increased in the model group (<0.01); Compare to the model group, the levels of the myocardial enzyme in serum decreased in low-, high-dose rutin groups; The levels of HBDH and LDH declined remarkably in the high-dose rutin group relative to the low-dose group (<0.05); Compared to the high-dose group, the level of LDH increased in the  group (<0.05).Moreover, relative to the model group, the morphology of myocardial tissue, the degree of fibrosis and the ultrastructure of myocardial tissue in mice were significantly improved in low-, high-dose rutin groups, and the effects were more significant in the high-dose rutin group.Rutin could decrease the levels of myocardial enzyme in serum in diabetic mice, improve the cardiac cell morphology and alleviate myocardial injury.Copyright© by Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Science Edition).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18949565>The effects of ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker on clusterin and apoptosis in the kidney tissue of streptozotocin-diabetic rats.</a></h1><p>Our first aim was to determine the effects of secreted clusterin (sCLU) and nuclear clusterin (nCLU) in diabetic nephropathy.

Five groups of Wistar albino rats were used: First group consisted of healthy controls; the second group included the untreated STZ-diabetics; 30 days of  or perindopril treated STZ-diabetics formed the third and the fourth groups, respectively; while the subjects receiving a combined treatment with  and perindopril for 30 days consisted the fifth group. TUNEL method for apoptosis and immunohistochemical staining for TGF-beta1, alpha-SMA, clusterin-beta and clusterin-alpha/beta antibodies were performed. Apoptotic cells especially increased in the kidney tubuli of untreated diabetic group and on the contrary, a significant decrease was observed in the group that received a combined drug treatment. While sCLU was increased in the glomeruli and tubuli of the untreated diabetic group, it was decreased in all the treated groups. An increase in the nCLU immunoreactivity was observed in the podocytes, mesangial cells, and the injured tubule cells of the untreated diabetic group. nCLU immunopositive cells were decreased in all treated diabetic groups. In addition to this, the distribution of nCLU was similar to the distribution of apoptotic cells in the diabetic groups. Our results indicate that sCLU expression in diabetic nephropathy was induced due to renal tissue damage, and the nCLU expression increase in renal tubuli was related to apoptosis.

Meanwhile, stress-related responses play critical roles in glucose metabolism in hypertensive patients. As clinical trials suggest that angiotensin-receptor blocker delays the onset of diabetes in hypertensive patients, we investigated the effects of  on stress-induced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 2-week intermittent restraint stress and orally treated with vehicle, 3 and 10 mg/kg/day . The plasma concentrations of lipid and proinflammatory cytokines [Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6] were assessed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Monocyte/macrophage accumulation in inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT) was observed with CD11b-positive cell counts and mRNA expressions of CD68 and F4/80 using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR methods respectively. The mRNA levels of angiotensinogen, proinflammatory cytokines shown above, and adiponectin in WAT were also assessed with RT-PCR method. Glucose metabolism was assessed by glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) and insulin tolerance tests, and mRNA expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in WAT. Restraint stress increased monocyte accumulation, plasma free  acids, expression of angiotensinogen and proinflammatory cytokines including MCP-1, and reduced adiponectin.  reduced stress-induced monocyte accumulation in WAT in a dose dependent manner.  treatment also suppressed induction of adipose angiotensinogen and proinflammatory cytokines in WAT and blood, and reversed changes in adiponectin expression. Notably,  suppressed stress-induced reduction in adipose tissue weight and free  acid release, and improved insulin tolerance with restoration of IRS-1 and GLUT4 mRNA expressions in WAT.

The intracellular NO and O2- levels of HUVECs were detected through flow cytometry.Our findings showed that nifedipine/sulphonylurea monotherapy significantly attenuated high glucose-induced (33 mM) HUVECs migration incapacity, while combination therapy of nifedipine and glibenclamide/glimepiride showed no protective effect. Both nifedipine/metformin monotherapy and combined therapy significantly mitigated the migration incapacity induced by high glucose in HUVECs. Combined with either metformin or sulphonylureas,  therapy was able to attenuate the high glucose-induced migration incapacity of HUVECs.

When calculating the eGFR decline from month 3, attenuation of the HR was less pronounced.Post hoc analysis.Despite increases in precision of the treatment effect, eGFR declines less than a doubling of serum creatinine value did not consistently improve statistical power of the clinical trials due to attenuation of the treatment effect. Attenuation of the treatment effect appears to be due in part to acute effects of ARBs on eGFR. These findings should be taken into account when using lesser eGFR declines as alternative end points for clinical trials.Copyright © 2014 National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-containing fibers innervate autonomic motor and premotor nuclei of the brainstem and spinal cord that regulate cardiovascular functions. We compared cardiovascular responses to application of TRH-analog in the brainstem of Wistar and T2D Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. GK rats exhibited basal systolic hypertension (152±2 mm Hg) and had a significantly potentiated, dose-related hypertensive response to intracisternal (i.c.) injection of the TRH-analog RX77368 (10-60 ng). In GK rats only, i.c. RX77368 (30-60 ng) markedly increased heart rate (HR; +88 b.p.m.) and induced acute cardiac mortality (100%), concurrent with extreme hyperglycemia (>26 mmol l(-1)), increased plasma H(2)O(2) and 8-isoprostane, and enhanced heart expression of NADPH oxidase 4 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 mRNAs. GK rats also had elevated basal plasma epinephrine, higher adrenal gene expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine β-hydroxylase (DβH), and greater plasma catecholamine and adrenal DβH responses to i.c.

In conclusion, sympathetic overactivation triggered by brainstem TRH contributes to the mechanism of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in T2D, which involves heightened cardiac inflammation and peripheral oxidative stress responses to sympathetic drive, and a mediating role of the renin-angiotensin system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24677717>Bilirubin and progression of nephropathy in type 2 : a post hoc analysis of RENAAL with independent replication in IDNT.</a></h1><p>Bilirubin, a potent endogenous antioxidant, was found to protect against the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in rodents. In humans, cross-sectional studies found an inverse relation between bilirubin and DN. We prospectively investigated whether bilirubin is associated with progression of DN toward end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To this end, we performed a post hoc analysis in the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trial with independent replication in the  Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT). Subjects with type 2  and nephropathy with alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin levels <1.5 times the upper limit of normal were included. The renal end point was defined as the composite of confirmed doubling of serum creatinine or ESRD. Bilirubin was inversely associated with the renal end point in RENAAL independent of age, sex, race, BMI, smoking, total cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c, treatment, estimated glomerular filtration rate, albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and AST. These results were confirmed in IDNT. This study indicates an independent inverse association of bilirubin with progression of nephropathy in RENAAL and IDNT. These data suggest a protective effect of bilirubin against progression of nephropathy in type 2 . The well-established role of bilirubin as an antioxidant is a potential explanation for the findings.© 2014 by the American  Association.

The diabetic model rats were then randomly divided into DM group, low-dose (8 mg/kg) and high-dose (16 mg/kg) TG treatment groups, and  (50 mg/kg) treatment group. After 8 weeks, the levels of blood glucose (BG), 24-h urine protein (24 h Upro), serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured. The pathological changes in the renal tissues were examined by optical microscopy, and the mean glomerular area (MGA) and mean glomerular volume (MGV) were measured with pathological image analysis. Immunohistochemical and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of HIF-1α and ET-1 protein in the renal tissue, and their mRNA expressions were detected using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR.HIF-1α and ET-1 expression increased in the kidney of diabetic rats. Compared with the diabetic model rats, the rats receiving TG and  treatment showed decreased levels of Scr, BUN, 24h Upro, MGA and MGV, improved renal histopathology, and reduced expression of HIF-1α and ET-1 mRNA and protein in the renal tissue. These changes were more obvious in high-dose TG treatment group. Correlation analysis showed that the expression of HIF-1α was positively correlated with that of ET-1, and they were both positively correlated with kidney weight index (KW/BW), 24 h Upro, MGA, and MGV.HIF-1α and ET-1 are overexpressed in the kidney of diabetic rats. TG can improve kidney damage in diabetic rats and delay the development of diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting the HIF-1α and ET-1 expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30430750> F-Labeled Derivatives of  for Angiotensin II Receptor PET Imaging.</a></h1><p>The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is a hormonal cascade involved in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance, and represents a common target for the treatment of various diseases including hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes.

However, it can only be measured indirectly (following its conversion to renin), with a renin immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). Unfortunately, treatment with a renin inhibitor interferes with this assay, because renin inhibitors induce a conformational change in prorenin, thereby allowing its detection as renin.We evaluated Molecular Innovation's new direct prorenin ELISA, which makes use of an antibody that recognizes an epitope near prorenin's putative cleavage site (R 43 L 44), thus no longer requiring prorenin activation. Plasma samples of 41 diabetic individuals treated with aliskiren (renin inhibitor) or  were tested. Semi-purified recombinant prorenin was used as standard, because the ELISA standard yielded approximately 10-fold lower values in the renin IRMA following its conversion to renin.The ELISA detected prorenin levels that were identical to those determined by the IRMA in untreated and -treated individuals. Yet, it yielded higher prorenin levels in aliskiren-treated individuals. Aliskiren, at levels reached in plasma during treatment, did not interfere with the ELISA, but allowed the detection of up to 20-30% of prorenin as renin in the IRMA, thereby resulting in a significant overestimation of renin and an underestimation of prorenin. The ELISA rendered results within 2 h and did not require a pretreatment period of several days to convert prorenin to renin.The new direct assay allows rapid prorenin detection, is not hampered by aliskiren when used at clinically relevant doses, and might be used to identify diabetic patients developing retinopathy and/or nephropathy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25872610>The renal protective effect of angiotensin receptor blockers depends on intra-individual response variation in multiple risk markers.</a></h1><p>Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are renoprotective and targeted to blood pressure. However, ARBs have multiple other (off-target) effects which may affect renal outcome. It is unknown whether on-target and off-target effects are congruent within individuals. If not, this variation in short term effects may have important implications for the prediction of individual long term renal outcomes. Our aim was to assess intra-individual variability in multiple parameters in response to ARBs in type 2 .Changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), albuminuria, potassium, haemoglobin, cholesterol and uric acid after 6 months of losartan treatment were assessed in the RENAAL database. Improvement in predictive performance of renal outcomes (ESRD or doubling serum creatinine) for each individual using ARB-induced changes in all risk markers was assessed by the relative integrative discrimination index (RIDI).SBP response showed high variability (mean -5.7 mmHg, 5(th) to 95(th) percentile -36.5 to +24.0 mmHg) between individuals. Changes in off-target parameters also showed high variability between individuals. No congruency was observed between responses to losartan in multiple parameters within individuals. Using individual responses in all risk markers significantly improved renal risk prediction (RIDI 30.4%, P < 0.01) compared with using only SBP changes. Results were successfully replicated in two independent trials with , IDNT and IRMA-2.In this post hoc analysis we showed that ARBs have multiple off-target effects which vary between and within individuals. Combining all ARB-induced responses beyond SBP provides a more accurate prediction of who will benefit from ARB therapy. Prospective trials are required to validate these findings.© 2015 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23040568>Incremental prognostic significance of peripheral endothelial dysfunction in patients with heart failure with normal left ventricular ejection fraction.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether peripheral endothelial dysfunction could predict the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure (HF) with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (HFNEF).Endothelial dysfunction plays an important role in HF, but the relation between peripheral endothelial dysfunction and prognosis in HFNEF remains unknown.We conducted a prospective cohort study of 321 patients with HFNEF. We evaluated cardiac function by echocardiography measuring the ratio of early transmitral flow velocity to tissue Doppler early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/e'), noninvasively assessed peripheral endothelial function by reactive hyperemia-peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) as the RH-PAT index (RHI), and followed cardiovascular events.A total of 59 patients had a cardiovascular event. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significantly higher probability of cardiovascular events in the low RHI group than in the high RHI group (mean follow-up: 20 months; log-rank test: p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox hazard analysis identified RHI (per 0.1) (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67 to 0.94; p = 0.007), E/e' (Ln[E/e'] [per 0.1]) (HR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.26; p = 0.006), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (Ln[BNP] [per picogram/milliliter]) (HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.44 to 2.28; p < 0.001) as independent predictors of cardiovascular events. The C-statistics for cardiovascular events substantially increased when the RHI was added to the HFNEF prognostic 5 factors (PF5)-age, , New York Heart Association classification, HF hospitalization history, and left ventricular ejection fraction-which were identified in the I-PRESERVE ( in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction Study) (PF5 alone: 0.671; PF5 + RHI: 0.712). The net reclassification index was significant after addition of the RHI (19.0%, p = 0.01).Peripheral endothelial dysfunction independently correlated with future cardiovascular events, adding incremental clinical significance for risk stratification in patients with HFNEF.

A Markov model was conducted from a Medicare prospective using data from the Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with  for Prevention of Vascular Events-A (ACTIVE-A) trial and other published studies. Base-case analysis evaluated patients 65 years old with AF, a CHADS(2) (congestive heart failure, 1 point; hypertension defined as blood pressure consistently >140/90 mm Hg or antihypertension medication, 1 point; age ≥75 years, 1 point; , 1 point; previous stroke or transient ishemic attack, 2 points) score of 2, and a lower risk for major bleeding. Patients received clopidogrel 75 mg/day plus aspirin or aspirin alone. Patients were followed for up to 35 years. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (in 2011 American dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Quality-adjusted life expectancy and costs were 9.37 QALYs and $88,751 with clopidogrel plus aspirin and 9.01 QALYs and $79,057 with aspirin alone. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for clopidogrel plus aspirin was $26,928/QALY. With 1-way sensitivity analysis using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, clopidogrel plus aspirin was no longer cost effective when the CHADS(2) score was ≤1, major bleeding risk with aspirin was ≥2.50%/patient-year, the relative risk decrease for ischemic stroke with clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone was <25%, and the utility of being healthy with AF on combination therapy decreased to 0.95. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that clopidogrel plus aspirin was cost effective in 55% and 73% of 10,000 iterations assuming willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000/QALY. In conclusion, clopidogrel plus aspirin appears cost-effective compared to aspirin alone for stroke prevention in patients with AF with a CHADS(2) of ≥2 and a lower risk of bleeding.Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

While angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the cleavage of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, the active peptide that causes a pressor response, the ARBs inhibit its peripheral action. The ARBs reduce blood pressure in animal models as well as in humans. Since their introduction in 1995, these agents have been used widely in the therapy of hypertension and to reduce the complications of hypertensive cardiovascular disease and diabetic nephropathy. The ARBs in clinical use in the United States include eight agents of similar chemical structure and activity, but somewhat different pharmacokinetics: losartan (Cozaar: 1995), valsartan (Diovan: 1996),  (Avapro: 1997), eprosartan (Teveten: 1997), candesartan (Atacand: 1998), telmisartan (Micardis: 1998), olmesartan (Benicar: 2002) and azilsartan (Edarbi: 2011). All of these agents have been associated with a minimal rate of serum enzyme elevations during chronic therapy (0.2% to 2%) which are usually mild-to-moderate in severity, self limited, and rarely require dose modification or discontinuation. As a class, the ARBs have been associated with rare instances of acute  injury that is usually self limited in duration, but varies in clinical expression, being usually hepatocellular but occasional cholestatic in nature. The most common presentation of  injury due to these agents is a cholestatic hepatitis arising within 1 to 8 weeks of starting and resolving as rapidly with stopping. Rare instances of prolonged jaundice have been described but not acute  failure or autoimmune chronic hepatitis. Several Individual case reports of clinically apparent  injury have been published in the literature for losartan, valsartan,  olmesartan and candesartan, but not specifically for azilsartan, eprosartan, and telmisartan, probably because these three have been in use for a shorter period of time and in fewer subjects. Most ARBs and particularly olmesartan have been linked to rare instances of severe sprue-like enteropathy. The enteropathy typically presents with severe diarrhea and weight loss with variable degrees of fatigue, nausea and abdominal discomfort arising 6 months to many years after starting the ARB. Small intestinal histological findings resemble those of celiac disease with flattening of the duodenal villuous pattern and villous atrophy. However, anti-transglutaminase and endomysial antibodies (the serologic markers of celiac disease) are negative and there is little or no response to a gluten-free diet. Withdrawal of the ARB, however, results in prompt improvement in the diarrhea and gradual resolution of duodenal villous flattening. Some cases of this drug induced enteropathy have had accompanying serum aminotransferase elevations and  by imaging or  biopsy, which, along with the diarrhea, resolve rapidly with stopping the medication.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25987260>Serum Bicarbonate and Kidney Disease Progression and Cardiovascular Outcome in Patients With Diabetic Nephropathy: A Post Hoc Analysis of the RENAAL (Reduction of End Points in Non-Insulin-Dependent  With the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan) Study and IDNT ( Diabetic Nephropathy Trial).</a></h1><p>Low serum bicarbonate level has been reported to be an independent predictor of kidney function decline and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Many studies have addressed the prognostic significance of these conditions and their treatment.Medline was selectively searched for articles published from 1948 to 2008 containing the terms "angiotensin," "microalbuminuria," and "retinopathy." The results were further amplified by screening the reference sections of the retrieved articles.Diabetic retinopathy and microalbuminuria are expressions of microvascular damage. They are promoted by hypertension, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and elevated levels of angiotensin II. They are treated by adjusting these risk factors to the near-normal range. In the IDNT study, angiotensin II blockade with  was found to lead to an absolute reduction of renal events by 7.4% as compared to standard treatment, and by 9.5% as compared to amlodipine. In the DIRECT study, candesartan reduced the progression of retinopathy by 13% and effected a regression by 34%. In the Steno-2 study, an intensive program of multifactorial risk reduction significantly lowered the rate of microvascular complications over a mean follow-up interval of 3.8 years (hazard ratios for different complications varying from 0.27 to 0.45). Over the longer term (13.3 years), this approach also led to a reduction of macrovascular events (HR 0.54 for mortality of all causes, 0.43 for cardiovascular mortality, and 0.41 for cardiovascular events).Diabetic retinopathy and microalbuminuria are expressions of microvascular damage. They often appear together and point toward possible future macrovascular events. Multifactorial intervention can lessen the consequences of these pathological conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19997579>Significance of initial blood pressure and comorbidity for the efficacy of a fixed combination of an angiotensin receptor blocker and hydrochlorothiazide in clinical practice.</a></h1><p>Two-thirds of all patients with arterial hypertension need drug combinations to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals.

The rats were randomly allotted into one of five experimental groups: A (control), B (diabetic untreated), C (diabetic treated with Q), D (diabetic treated with Irb), and E (diabetic treated with Q&Irb), each group containing 10 animals. Groups B-E received STZ.  was induced in four groups by a single intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of STZ (50 mg/kg, freshly dissolved in 5 mmol/L citrate buffer, pH 4.5). Two days after STZ treatment, development of  in four experimental groups was confirmed by measuring blood glucose levels in a tail vein blood samples. Rats with blood glucose levels of 250 mg/dL or higher were considered to be diabetic. The rats in Q-, Irb-, and Q&Irb-treated groups were given Q (in a dose of 3 mg/kg body weight), Irb (5 mg/kg body weight), and Q&Irb (in a dose of 1.5 mg/kg + 2.5 mg/kg body weight) once a day orally by using intra-gastric intubation for 12 weeks starting two days after STZ injection. Treatment of Q and especially Irb reduced the glomerular size and thickening of capsular, glomerular, and tubular basement membranes; and increased amounts of mesangial matrix and tubular dilatation and renal function as compared with diabetics untreated. Notably, the better effects were obtained when Q and Irb given together. We conclude that Q, Irb, and especially Q+Irb therapy causes renal morphologic and functional improvement after STZ-induced  in rats. We believe that further preclinical research into the utility of Q and Irb treatment, alone or its combination, may indicate its usefulness as a potential treatment in diabetic nephropathy (DNp).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29279269>Renin angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers usage among type II  patients-A Retrospective Study.</a></h1><p>Recent data showed an alarming rise of new dialysis cases secondary to diabetic nephropathy despite the growing usage of RAAS blockers. Primary objective of this study is to explore the prevalence of RAAS blockers usage among type II diabetic patients, secondary objectives are to compare the prescribing pattern of RAAS blocker between primary and tertiary care center and to explore if the dose of RAAS blocker prescribed was at optimal dose as suggested by trials.This is a retrospective study conducted at one public tertiary referral hospital and one public health clinic in Sungai Petani, Kedah, Malaysia.RAAS blockers in T2DM patients was found to be 65%. In primary care, 14.3% of the RAAS blockers prescribed was ARB. Tertiary care had higher utilization of ARB, which was 42.9%. In primary care setting, the most commonly used ACEI were perindopril (92.4%) followed by enalapril (7.6%), meanwhile perindopril was the only ACEI being prescribed in tertiary care. The most prescribed ARB was  (63.6%) and telmisartan (54.2%) respectively in primary and tertiary care. Overall, 64.9% of RAAS blockers prescribed by both levels of care were found to be achieving the target dose as recommended in landmark trials. Crude odd ratio of prescribing RAAS blocker in primary care versus tertiary care was reported as 2.70 (95% CI: 1.49 to 4.91).RAAS blockers usage among T2DM patients was higher in primary care versus tertiary care settings.

An oral hypoglycemic agent, metformin may have a potential effect on the inhibition of glycation reactions. Further, since a pathophysiological crosstalk between renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and AGEs-RAGE axis is involved in diabetic nephropathy, it is conceivable that metformin and  additively could protect against the AGEs-RAGE-induced tubular cell injury. In this study, we addressed the issues. Metformin dose-dependently inhibited the formation of AGEs modification of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Compared with AGEs-modified BSA prepared without metformin (AGEs-MF0), those prepared in the presence of 30 mM or 100 mM metformin (AGEs-MF30 or AGEs-MF100) significantly reduced RAGE mRNA level, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, apoptosis, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and transforming growth factor-β mRNA level in tubular cells.  further inhibited the harmful effects of AGEs-MF0 or AGEs-MF30 on tubular cells. Our present study suggests that combination therapy with metformin and  may have therapeutic potential in diabetic nephropathy; it could play a protective role against tubular injury in  not only by inhibiting AGEs formation, but also by attenuating the deleterious effects of AGEs via down-regulating RAGE expression and subsequently suppressing ROS generation.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the MA group, uPEDF in patients with diabetic retinopathy was significantly higher than that in patients without diabetic retinopathy. Longitudinal study:  significantly decreased uPEDF in T2DM with MA.

Evidence have shown that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a key mediator in the development of DN. However, treatment of DN by blocking the TGF-β1/Smad7 pathway remains limited. Xiaokeping mixture (XKP), a traditional Chinese herbal compound, has been used for treatment in patients with DN for many years.In the present study, TGF-β1/Smad7 pathway analysis was used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of XKP on DN rats induced by streptozotocin and to address the underlying molecular mechanism. Male rats were divided into four groups: normal control, untreated control group (fed with high fat), -treated DN, and XKP-treated DN, respectively. Levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urine protein of 24 hours, and triacylglycerol were detected. Pathological changes of renal tissues were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis were used to detect the expressions of TGF-β1 and Smad7.The results demonstrated that XKP can effectively reduce the levels of glucose, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urine protein of 24 hours, and triacylglycerol. Further studies indicated that inhibition of DN in XKP-treated DN rats was associated with inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad7 signaling as demonstrated by downregulation of TGF-β1 but upregulation of Smad7.The data obtained from the present study indicate that XKP may be a therapeutic agent for DN.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21040538>Urinary proteome analysis enables assessment of renoprotective treatment in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria.</a></h1><p>Previously the angiotensin II receptor blocker  has been demonstrated to reduce the risk for progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of treatment with  in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria on the urinary proteome.High-resolution capillary-electrophoresis coupled to mass-spectrometry (CE-MS) was used to profile the low-molecular-weight proteome in urine of a subgroup of patients from a two year randomized  versus placebo therapy trial, which included hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria on ongoing antihypertensive medication (IRMA2-substudy).We demonstrate that the therapy with 300 mg  daily over a period of two years results in significant changes of the urinary proteome. Both, a classifier developed previously that consists of urinary peptides indicative of chronic kidney disease, as well as several individual peptides changed significantly after treatment. These changes were not observed in the placebo-treated individuals. Most prominent are changes of urinary collagen fragments associated with progression of diabetic nephropathy, indicating normalization in urinary peptides.CE-MS analysis of urine enabled identification of peptides as potential surrogate markers for renoprotection in microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients, which show persistent improvement after longterm treatment with .

Three groups of male Wistar albino rats were used. The first group consisted of non-diabetic control rats. The second group was the untreated diabetic rats. The third group consisted of diabetic rats treated with , which is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, widely used in treatment for hypertension. Immunohistochemical stainings for TGF-beta 1, bax, caspase-3 and WT-1 were performed. The microalbuminuria levels of the -treated diabetic group were lower than those of the untreated diabetic group (P<0.01). The immunostaining of TGF-beta 1, bax and caspase-3 was decreased in glomeruli of the -treated diabetic group compared to the untreated diabetic group. WT-1 immunopositive podocyte numbers were found to be significantly lower in the untreated diabetic group than in the other groups (P<0.01). In the -treated diabetic group, the WT-1 immunopositive cell numbers were higher compared to the untreated diabetic group (P<0.01). We conclude that the decrease in the number of podocytes is an early marker of diabetic nephropathy, AT1 receptor blocker has renoprotective effects on the regulation of renal hemodynamics and on the control of tissue damage by preventing podocyte loss, which leads to decrease of bax and caspase-3 expressions of apoptosis related proteins, and may prevent glomerular cell apoptosis via angiotensin II.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Guidelines recommend five first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes, but compelling indications may indicate favoring one drug class over another. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have demonstrated a blood pressure lowering efficacy which is at least comparable with other drug classes, including ACE inhibitors (ACE-I), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics. They have, in addition, a lower side effect profile than other drug classes and patients on ARBs are more persistent with therapy. Compelling indications for the use of ARBs are heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, diabetic nephropathy, proteinuria/microalbuminuria, left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation, metabolic syndrome and ACE-I induced cough. The ARB  has demonstrated a high efficacy in lowering blood pressure, which has been shown to be at least comparable with ACE-Is and superior to other ARBs such as losartan and valsartan. This translated into a better cost-effectiveness for  than for valsartan and losartan in the treatment of hypertension. In addition,  has been shown to be effective in both early and late stage diabetic nephropathy. It has further demonstrated considerable cost savings over standard therapy including beta-blockers, diuretics and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers at all stages of kidney disease.

Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disease through blood pressure-independent mechanisms mediated by angiotensin II. Thus, inhibiting the RAS with either an ARB or an ACE inhibitor may confer additional benefit in people with advanced nephropathy that cannot be explained totally by reductions in blood pressure. Preclinical evidence suggests that blood pressure lowering is not solely responsible for the organ and tissue protective effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Furthermore, clinical studies evaluating effects on end organs and surrogate markers have shown that these agents have blood pressure-independent effects. There is also intriguing evidence that agents in the same class may differ in their effects on renal function despite similar blood pressure control. Support for blood pressure-independent effects comes from outcome studies. Agents evaluated in such studies and that appear to have effects independent of blood pressure lowering include , losartan, ramipril, and telmisartan. Taken together, this body of evidence indicates that the clinical benefits of ARBs and ACE inhibitors in patients with advanced nephropathy extend beyond blood pressure reduction. Therefore, although antihypertensive efficacy is of primary importance in choosing a treatment to provide cardiovascular and renal protection, consideration should be given to the effects of an agent that extend beyond blood pressure.Copyright  2010 Elsevier Inc.

Leptin may cause delayed gastric emptying in the central and peripheral pathways. Microcirculatory disturbances in the stomach make gastric smooth muscles and nerves hypoxic-ischemic, thereby impairing gastric motility.  is an angiotensin II (ATII) receptor blocker that indirectly decreases serum leptin levels and improves blood vessel endothelia. This study examined the effect of  on DG and its relationship with serum leptin levels and microcirculatory disturbances of the stomach. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with streptozotocin to induce  and were then treated with or without 0.012 g·kg(-1)·d(-1)  by gavage. After six weeks of treatment, the gastric evacuation rate (GER) was measured using phenol red. Serum leptin levels were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Endothelin (ET) in the stomach tissue was examined using a radioimmunoassay, whereas chemical colorimetry was used to measure the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity of stomach tissues. The mRNA expression of the ATII receptor (AT1R) was assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Treatment with  significantly increased the GER of diabetic rats and reduced the serum leptin levels, as well as decreased the ET content and AT1R mRNA expression in the stomach (P<0.05). Changes in the cNOS activity after  intervention were not significant (P>0.05), whereas iNOS activity was significantly decreased (P<0.05).  can alleviate hyperglycemia-induced delayed gastric emptying, which is associated with decreased serum leptin levels and improved microcirculation in the stomach.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23235349>Comparative efficacy of / hydrochlorothiazide and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination in lowering blood pressure: a retrospective observational study in Oman.</a></h1><p>To compare blood pressure (BP) control in patients receiving /hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and valsartan/HCTZ at a tertiary care university hospital in Oman.This was a retrospective observational study, where 232 patients' medical records were reviewed during a 3-month period, July to September 2010, at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital in Oman. BP readings of the previous 6 months were also retrieved from the electronic medical records. Analyses were conducted using univariate statistical techniques.The mean age of the cohort was 58 ± 11 years (range: 21-88). Sixty-nine (30%) patients were on the /HCTZ combination (150/12.5 mg) and 163 (70%) were on the valsartan/HCTZ combination. The patients on the valsartan/HCTZ combination were divided into two subgroups: 117 (72%) received 160/12.5 mg and 46 (28%) 80/12.5 mg. Diabetic patients (43/69, 62%, vs. 61/163, 37%, p < 0.001) and those with diabetic nephropathy (8/69, 12%, vs. 7/163, 4%, p = 0.039) were prescribed more often /HCTZ than valsartan/HCTZ. In comparison to the valsartan/HCTZ cohort, the /HCTZ group was associated with significant reductions in both systolic BP (SBP; -9 vs. -2 mm Hg; p = 0.021) and diastolic BP (DBP; -5 vs. 0 mm Hg; p = 0.022). BP reductions were noted more in diabetics than nondiabetics with the /HCTZ patients associated with significant reductions in both SBP (-12 vs. 5.1 mm Hg; p < 0.001) and DBP (-6.4 vs. 1.9 mm Hg; p = 0.001).The /HCTZ combination was associated with significant reductions in both SBP and DBP when compared with the valsartan/HCTZ combination.

In our study we assessed whether the combination of zofenopril + hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) was at least as effective as  + HCTZ in essential hypertensives with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, uncontrolled by a previous monotherapy.After a 2-week placebo washout, 361 treated hypertensive patients [office sitting diastolic BP (DBP), ≥90 mmHg], aged 18-75 years, were randomized double blind to 18-week treatment with zofenopril 30 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg or  150 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg once daily, in an international, multicenter study. After the first 6 and 12 weeks, zofenopril and  doses could be doubled in non-normalized subjects. The primary study end point was the office sitting DBP reduction after 18 weeks of treatment. Secondary end points included office systolic BP (SBP), ambulatory BP and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).The between-treatment difference for office DBP averaged to +1.0 (95% CI -0.4, +0.8) mmHg (P = 0.150), the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval being inferior to the protocol-defined non-inferiority limit (3 mmHg). In the subset of patients with valid ambulatory BP, no difference in 24-h average DBP [n = 181; 6.7 (8.7, 4.6) zofenopril + HCTZ vs. 6.3 (8.8, 3.7) mmHg  + HCTZ, P = 0.810] and SBP reductions [11.7 (15.4, 8.0) vs. 12.6 (17.2, 8.0) mmHg, P = 0.758] were observed between the two treatment groups. hs-CRP was reduced by zofenopril + HCTZ [-0.52 (-1.05, 0.01) mg/L], while it was increased by  plus HCTZ [0.97 (0.29, 1.65) mg/L, P = 0.001 between treatments].In previously monotherapy-treated, uncontrolled patients with hypertension, zofenopril 30-60 mg + HCTZ 12.5 mg is as effective as  150-300 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg, with the added value of a potential protective effect against vascular inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25302657>A prediction model for sudden cardiac death in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction.</a></h1><p>Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for ∼ 25% of all deaths in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, strategies to identify HFpEF patients at a higher risk of SCD have not been developed.We studied 4128 patients with HFpEF enrolled in the  in Patients with Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction (I-PRESERVE) trial. All SCDs were adjudicated by a clinical endpoint committee. Cumulative incidences of SCD were estimated counting other deaths as competing risks. Cox regression analysis was used to generate a risk model for SCD. During a mean follow-up of 4.1 years, 231 (5.6%) patients died suddenly and 650 (15.7%) died non-suddenly. A multivariable model in 3480 patients including age, gender, history of  and myocardial infarction, LBBB on ECG, and the natural logarithm of NT-proBNP identified a subgroup of 837 (24%) patients with ≥10% cumulative incidence of SCD over 5 years, accounting for other deaths as competing risk (Harrell's C index 0.75). The 5-year cumulative incidences of SCD in the higher and lower risk groups were 11% and 4%, respectively. In the higher risk group, 32% of deaths were SCD compared with 26% in the entire I-PRESERVE cohort.A multivariable prediction model identified patients with HFpEF who have a ≥10% risk of SCD over 5 years, similar to the risk of SCD in the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure (SCD-Heft) trial. This model may be useful for selecting patients with HFpEF for SCD prevention trials.© 2014 The Authors.

The authors enrolled 60 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and /prediabetes and performed clinic, home, and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring. , amlodipine, and indapamide were used according to a titration schedule from step 1 to 5 for target home BP level ≤125/75 mm Hg. The flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), radial augmentation index (AI), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and urinary albumin excretion ratio (UACR), as a surrogate marker of TOD, were measured at baseline and 6 months. Compared with baseline, clinic, home, and ambulatory BP measures were significantly lower in the sixth month. FMD was increased significantly and AI, PWV, and UACR were reduced by the treatment. The extent of the changes in PWV and UACR were associated with the changes in all BP measures, but only the change in home morning BP was associated with the change in FMD. The change in AI was not associated with the change in BP levels, but was associated with the change in PWV. A very aggressive antihypertensive therapy guided by home morning BP was effective for surrogate end points in patients with /prediabetes.© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p></html>
