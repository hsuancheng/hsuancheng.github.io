The sympathetic innervation of the GI tract modulates motility, blood flow, and secretion, and therefore defective norepinephrine release may contribute to symptom generation in . Accordingly, our aim here was to utilize the mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS; 5% wt/vol) of  to determine how norepinephrine release is reduced during GI inflammation. We hypothesized that the inflammation-induced reduction in norepinephrine release was due to inhibition of voltage-gated Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) in prevertebral sympathetic neurons. We compared [(3)H]norepinephrine release in the colon and jejunum and I(Ca) amplitude in superior mesenteric ganglion (SMG) neurons from control mice and mice with DSS-induced colitis. Changes to voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels were investigated by fura 2-AM Ca(2+) imaging, perforated patch-clamp electrophysiology, and real-time PCR. Depolarization-induced norepinephrine release from the inflamed colon and uninflamed jejunum was significantly impaired in mice treated with DSS, as was depolarization-induced Ca(2+) influx in SMG neurons. Colitis reduced I(Ca) in SMG neurons by inhibiting omega-conotoxin GVIA (300 nM)-sensitive N-type Ca(2+) channels. The omega-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive component of norepinephrine release was significantly smaller in the colon during colitis. The inhibition of I(Ca) was accompanied by a decrease in mRNA encoding the Ca(2+) channel alpha subunit (CaV 2.2) and a rightward shift in the voltage dependence of activation of I(Ca). These findings suggest that DSS-induced colitis attenuates norepinephrine release in the colon and jejunum due to inhibition of N-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. This may contribute to functional alterations in both inflamed and uninflamed regions of the GI tract during inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819742>Evidence against a systemic arterial defect in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Despite increasing interest in local microvascular alterations associated with inflammatory bowel disease (), the potential contribution of a primary systemic vascular defect in the etiology of  is unknown. We compared reactivity of large diameter mesenteric arteries from segments affected by Crohn disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) to an uninvolved vascular bed in both  and control patients.Mesenteric and omental arteries were obtained from UC, CD, and non- patients. Isometric arterial contractions were recorded in response to extracellular potassium (K(+)) and cumulative additions of norepinephrine (NE). In addition, relaxation in response to pinacidil, an activator of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K(+) channels was examined.Contraction to K(+) and sensitivity to NE were not significantly different in arteries from CD, UC, and controls. Relaxation to pinacidil was also similar between groups.Potassium-induced contractions and sensitivity to NE and pinacidil were not significantly different in large diameter mesenteric and omental arteries obtained from  patients. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the sensitivity to K(+), NE, and pinacidil between mesenteric and omental arteries of CD and UC patients and those from non- patients.

The aim of this study, accordingly, was to investigate the role of phospholipid metabolism in the intestinal mucosa in inflammatory bowel disease (). Surgically resected specimens from patients with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and colrectal cancer (non-cancerous tissue; as a control) were submitted to phospholipid analysis and a PLase A2 assay, which measures the degradation of endogenous mucosal phospholipids. A high percentage of plasmenylethanolamine (plas.E) was detected in the glycerophospholipid fraction of CD mucosa. The arachidonic acid content of the phosphatidylethanolamine plus plas.E subfraction was higher in inflamed than in intact mucosa in CD. PLaseA2 activity, resulting in lysophosphatidyl  production, was detected only in inflamed mucosa from CD and UC patients, but not in normal mucosa from controls. PLaseA2 activity was highest in moderately inflamed mucosa adjacent to a severely ulcerated area. The PLaseA2 that reacts with endogenous phosphatidylcholine (PC) to form lysoPC was found irrespective of the presence of inflammation. The PLaseA2 that reacts with -containing phospholipids is more closely related to inflammation than other PLaseA2 isoenzymes in  mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8488366>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha potentiates phospholipase A2-stimulated release and metabolism of arachidonic acid in cultured intestinal epithelial cells (INT 407).</a></h2><p>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a known pro-inflammatory cytokine, has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease () by mediating damage to the intestinal epithelial cells. The present study demonstrates that TNF-alpha potentiates release and metabolism of 14C-labeled arachidonic acid (14C-AA) in cultured intestinal epithelial cells (INT 407). Although TNF-alpha on its own was but a weak stimulator of cellular 14C-AA turnover, it significantly potentiated the release of 14C-AA and 14C-labeled prostaglandin E2(14C-PGE2) after stimulation with three known phospholipase A2 activators: phospholipase. C from Clostridium perfringens, the calcium ionophore A23187, and the phorbol ester 4-beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). The phospholipase A2 inhibitor quinacrine significantly reduced both AA and PGE2 release after combined stimulation with phospholipase C and TNF-alpha. In contrast to its effect on the AA turnover, TNF-alpha did not affect the phospholipase C-stimulated production of platelet-activating factor (PAF-acether). Taken together, these findings indicate that a) TNF-alpha potentiates phospholipase A2-stimulated AA release from cultured intestinal epithelial cells; b) TNF-alpha may stimulate phospholipase A2-dependent AA release without affecting the formation of PAF-acether and c) pretreatment with TNF-alpha potentiates the formation of PGE2 after stimulation with phospholipase A2 activators. In summary, the present investigation points to the possibility that TNF-alpha may stimulate intestinal epithelial cells to produce biologically active AA metabolites and that this stimulation may be modulated by components of the intestinal luminal content, like bacterial toxins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9923718>A review of in vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy of cerebral ischemia in rats.</a></h2><p>A number of metabolic alterations are initiated by cerebral ischemia including dramatic increases in lactate concentration, decreases in N-acetylaspartate, choline, and creatine concentrations, as well as changes in amino acid levels. A review of proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies of focal and global cerebral ischemia in rats is presented here. In particular, studies in neonatal rats have shown that a continued elevation of lactate levels without recovery after hypoxia-ischemia or a decrease in N-acetylaspartate concentration at any time are indicative of deleterious outcome. Studies of the effect of temperature on ischemic damage in a model of focal ischemia showed that outcome improved with mild hypothermia. Again, lack of recovery of lactate upon reperfusion was shown to be indicative of poor outcome. Dichloroacetic acid was used to treat rats with focal ischemic damage. Animals subjected to transient ischemia that were treated with dichloroacetic acid showed significant decreases in lactate concentration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9200313>Mediators of mucosal inflammation: implications for therapy.</a></h2><p>Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease remains a challenge. The major shortcoming in the development of new therapeutic approaches is the fact that the cause of inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown. Recognition of the importance of the arachidonic acid cascade of inflammatory mediators presents the opportunity to specifically inhibit or antagonize leukotriene B4, thromboxane, platelet activating factor, or phospholipase. Interleukins and cytokines have more recently been defined as targets for specific therapy. The results of these specific immune modulating studies are not only important from a therapeutic point of view, but substantially contribute to our understanding of the pathogenic cascades in .

We compared MMS-68 induced mucin release with other known intestinal mucin secretagogues in normal colon explants and in the HT-29 colon cancer cell line, and to study the effects of MMS-68 on mucin release from inflamed and uninflamed ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) mucosa. In normal colonic explants and HT-29 cells, each of the secretagogues including, MMS-68-induced mucin release two- to fivefold more than culture medium alone. In HT-29 cells, MMS-68 plus leukotriene C4 (LTC4) induced a 50% increase in mucin release over either secretagogue alone, and MMS-68 plus platelet-activating factor (PAF) markedly enhanced mucin release by eightfold over either secretagogue. In colonic explants from patients with UC and CD, the mucin release in response to MMS-68 was similar to that of normal colonic explants. Likewise, in isolated epithelial cells from CD and UC (whether involved or uninvolved), MMS-68-induced release was similar to that of epithelial cells isolated from normal colonic mucosa. The number of MMS-68-producing macrophages was lower in uninflamed UC mucosa compared with inflamed UC mucosa and CD mucosa. The mucin secretagogue activity of MMS-68 is comparable to that of other known secretagogues, and PAF can have a synergistic effect on this activity. Whole tissue explants and isolated colonic epithelial cells from patients with  respond at least as well as their normal counterparts to MMS-68. MMS-68 may play a role in mucin secretion in normal and inflamed colonic tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18395894>Current view of the immunopathogenesis in inflammatory bowel disease and its implications for therapy.</a></h2><p>Al though the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease () remains unknown, the pathogenesis is gradually being unravelled, seeming to be the result of a combination of environmental, genetic, and immunological factors in which an uncontrolled immune response within the intestinal lumen leads to inflammation in genetically predisposed individuals.

UR-12746 is a novel, locally-acting compound which combines, through an azo bond, 5-aminosalicylic (5-ASA) and UR-12715, a potent platelet activating factor (PAF)-antagonist. UR-12746 oral pretreatment of colitic rats (50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) reduced acute colonic damage when evaluated 2 days after colonic insult. Postreatment for 4 weeks with UR-12746 (50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) resulted in a faster recovery of the damaged colonic mucosa, which was macroscopically significant from the third week. The intestinal anti-inflammatory effect of UR-12746 was associated with a decrease in leukocyte infiltration in the colonic mucosa, which was evidenced both biochemically, by a reduction in myeloperoxidase activity, and histologically, by a lower leukocyte count after morphometric analysis. This effect was higher than that seen with sulphasalazine, when assayed at the same doses and in the same experimental conditions. Several mechanisms can be involved in the beneficial effects showed by UR-12746: inhibition of leukotriene B(4) synthesis in the inflamed colon, improvement of the altered colonic oxidative status, and reduction of colonic interleukin-1beta production. The results suggest that the intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of UR-12746 can be attributed to the additive effects exerted by 5-ASA and UR-12715, the PAF antagonist compound, that are released in the colonic lumen after reduction of the azo bond by the intestinal bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24130731>Lactobacillus acidophilus alleviates platelet-activating factor-induced inflammatory responses in human intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Probiotics have been used as alternative prevention and therapy modalities in intestinal inflammatory disorders including inflammatory bowel diseases () and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Pathophysiology of  and NEC includes the production of diverse lipid mediators, including platelet-activating factor (PAF) that mediate inflammatory responses in the disease. PAF is known to activate NF-κB, however, the mechanisms of PAF-induced inflammation are not fully defined. We have recently described a novel PAF-triggered pathway of NF-κB activation and IL-8 production in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), requiring the pivotal role of the adaptor protein Bcl10 and its interactions with CARMA3 and MALT1. The current studies examined the potential role of the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus in reversing the PAF-induced, Bcl10-dependent NF-κB activation and IL-8 production in IECs. PAF treatment (5 µM×24 h) of NCM460 and Caco-2 cells significantly increased nuclear p65 NF-κB levels and IL-8 secretion (2-3-fold, P<0.05), compared to control, which were blocked by pretreatment of the cells for 6 h with L. acidophilus (LA) or its culture supernatant (CS), followed by continued treatments with PAF for 24 h. LA-CS also attenuated PAF-induced increase in Bcl10 mRNA and protein levels and Bcl10 promoter activity. LA-CS did not alter PAF-induced interaction of Bcl10 with CARMA3, but attenuated Bcl10 interaction with MALT1 and also PAF-induced ubiquitination of IKKγ. Efficacy of bacteria-free CS of LA in counteracting PAF-induced inflammatory cascade suggests that soluble factor(s) in the CS of LA mediate these effects. These results define a novel mechanism by which probiotics counteract PAF-induced inflammation in IECs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27825166>The Effects of Ivabradine on Cardiac Function after Myocardial Infarction are Weaker in Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>Plasma norepinephrine (NE) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP, termed BNP-45 in rats) are considered as essential neurohormones indicating heart failure progression. The purposes of this study were to examine the effects of ivabradine (IBD) on cardiac function and plasma NE and BNP-45 after chronic ischemic heart failure (CHF) in non-diabetic rats and diabetic rats. We further determined if sympathetic NE uptake-1 (a major pathway to metabolize NE) mechanism is responsible for the role played by IBD.We ligated rat's coronary artery to induce CHF; and injected streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetic hyperglycemia. Echocardiography was employed to determine cardiac function. We used ELISA to examine plasma NE and BNP-45; and Western Blot analysis to examine the protein levels of NE uptake-1 in sympathetic nerves.CHF increased the levels of NE and BNP-45 in non-STZ rats and STZ rats. Systemic injection of IBD significantly attenuated the augmented NE and BNP-45 and impaired left ventricular function induced by CHF in those rats. This effect appeared to be less in STZ rats. A liner relation was observed between the NE/BNP-45 levels and left ventricular function after administration of IBD. Also, IBD was observed to have a recovery effect on the downregulated NE uptake-1 evoked by CHF, but to a smaller degree in STZ rats.Our data revealed specific signaling mechanisms by which IBD improves the cardiac function as IBD alleviates impaired NE uptake-1and thereby decreases heightened NE and BNP-45 induced by CHF. Our data also demonstrated that the effects of IBD are weakened after diabetic hyperglycemia likely due to worsen NE uptake-1 pathway. Thus, targeting sympathetic NE uptake-1 signaling molecules has clinical implications for treatment and management of CHF in . Our data were also to shed light on strategies for application of this drug because NE and BNP play an important role in regulation of progression and prognosis of CHF, and in particular, because IBD affects NE uptake-1 pathway in hyperglycemic animals to a less degree.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

Intestinal  is however readily accessible during periods of intestinal inflammation, and enables pathogens to outcompete the host microbiota under such circumstances.Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine expression of genes central to  metabolism; transmission electron microscopy to detect presence of bacterial microcompartments (MCPs); in vitro infections of both murine and human macrophage cell lines examining intracellular replication of the AIEC-type strain LF82 and clinical E. coli isolates in the presence of ; determination of E. coli  utilization (eut) operon transcription in faecal samples from healthy patients, patients with active CD and the same patients in remission following treatment.Growth on the intestinal short chain fatty acid propionic acid (PA) stimulates significantly increased transcription of the eut operon (fold change relative to glucose: >16.9; p-value <.01). Additionally  was accessible to intra-macrophage AIEC and stimulated significant increases in growth intracellularly when it was added extracellularly at concentrations comparable to those in the human intestine. Finally, qRT-PCR indicated that expression of the E. coli eut operon was increased in children with active CD compared to healthy controls (fold change increase: >4.72; P < .02). After clinical remission post-exclusive enteral nutrition treatment, the same CD patients exhibited significantly reduced eut expression (Pre vs Post fold change decrease: >15.64; P < .01).Our data indicates a role for  metabolism in selecting for AIEC that are consistently overrepresented in the CD intestine. The increased E. coli metabolism of  seen in the intestine during active CD, and its decrease during remission, indicates  use may be a key factor in shaping the intestinal microbiome in CD patients, particularly during times of inflammation.

In this study, we characterized the colitogenic activity of  as part of a simplified human microbial consortium based on seven enteric bacterial strains (SIHUMI). RNA sequencing analysis of  isolated from monoassociated wild type and IL-10 mice identified 408 genes including 14 genes of the  utilization () locus that were significantly up-regulated in response to inflammation. Despite considerable up-regulation of  genes, deletion of  utilization (Δ) had no impact on  colitogenic activity in monoassociated IL-10 mice. However, replacement of the  wild type bacteria by a Δ mutant in SIHUMI-colonized IL-10 mice resulted in exacerbated colitis, suggesting protective functions of   utilization in complex bacterial communities. To better understand  gene response in the presence of other microbes, we purified wild type  cells from the colon content of SIHUMI-colonized wild type and IL-10 mice using immuno-magnetic separation and performed RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the bacterial environment reprograms  gene expression in response to inflammation, with the majority of differentially expressed genes not being shared between monocolonized and SIHUMI conditions. While in  monoassociation a general bacterial stress response could be observed, expression of  genes in SIHUMI-colonized mice was characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in growth and replication. Interestingly, in mice colonized with SIHUMI lacking  enhanced inflammation was observed in comparison to SIHUMI-colonized mice, supporting the hypothesis that   metabolism protects against colitis in complex consortia. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that complex bacterial consortia interactions reprogram the gene expression profile and colitogenic activity of the opportunistic pathogen  toward a protective function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20615391>Neurogenic regulation of dendritic cells in the intestine.</a></h2><p>Antigen presenting cells like dendritic cells (DC) are responsible for the initiation of adaptive immune responses via the T helper cells they activate. The type of T cell responses DC induce is dependent on the local immunological environment where antigen has been taken up. In the gut, resident DC are phenotypically and functionally shaped by epithelial and stromal cell derived signals, the cytokine microenvironment, and neuronal products. These factors can control the activation state of DC thereby inducing tolerance for food and commensal organisms or immunity against pathogenic microbes. The enteric nervous system (ENS) is increasingly recognized as an important regulatory factor in intestinal immune cell control. Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides like acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are released by neurons of the ENS and can affect the function of DC and subsequent immune responses. The critical balance between tolerance and protective immunity is disrupted in inflammatory bowel disease, which results in an exaggerated immune response against commensal bacteria. In this review we discuss the effects of ACh, VIP, and NE on DC function. DC express various receptors for these neuron derived products and can alter DC co-stimulatory molecule expression, cytokine release and subsequent T cell activation in an anti-inflammatory fashion. Knowledge about these interactions will help find new drug targets and may facilitate the development of specific therapies for diseases like inflammatory bowel disease ().Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD) represent paradigmatic examples of intestinal chronic inflammatory conditions in which the process of neovascularization correlates with the severity and progression of the diseases. Molecules able to target the angiogenesis have thus the potential to synergistically affect the disease course. Beyond its anti-inflammatory effect, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is able to reduce angiogenesis in several chronic inflammatory conditions, but no data about its anti-angiogenic activity in colitis have been produced, yet.The effects of PEA on inflammation-associated angiogenesis in mice with dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and in patients with UC were assessed. The release of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), the hemoglobin tissue content, the expression of CD31 and of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian-target-of-rapamycin (mTOR) signaling axis were all evaluated in the presence of different concentrations of PEA and concomitant administration of PPAR-α and -γ antagonists.Our results demonstrated that PEA, in a selective peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α dependent mechanism, inhibits colitis-associated angiogenesis, decreasing VEGF release and new vessels formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the mTOR/Akt axis regulates, at least partly, the angiogenic process in IBD and that PEA directly affects this pathway.Our results suggest that PEA may improve inflammation-driven angiogenesis in colonic mucosa, thus reducing the mucosal damage and potentially affecting disease progression and the shift towards the carcinogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1512051>The role of the mucosal immune system in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Continued delineation of the major factors that lead to intestinal inflammation will provide critical insights into many of the pathophysiologic events leading to tissue destruction in .

Inflammatory bowel disease () is a condition that involves proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins 1beta and 6 (ILs). In this disease, it has been shown that an abnormal microcirculatory system is implicated. 2. Therefore, the effects of in vivo treatment for three days with interleukins 1beta and 6 were investigated on rat isolated mesenteric vascular bed (MVB). 3. A significant concentration-dependent increase in vascular response to noradrenaline (NA) was found, with a significant difference in Emax between control (93.01 +/- 16.78 mmHg) and treated preparations (137.91 +/- 5.20 mmHg). Endothelin-1(ET-1) induced a significantly greater increase of perfusion pressure in treated rats in comparison with control rats at the highest concentration used (0.1 microm). 4. The concentration-dependent decrease of perfusion pressure induced by acetylcholine (ACh) in MVB precontracted with NA was significantly reduced in specimens from treated rats in comparison with control rats, with a significant difference in Emax between control and treated preparations. 5. Perivascular nerve stimulation (PNS) evoked contractions with no difference between treatments. Similarly, no difference in relaxant effect was found after PNS in specimens precontracted with NA, in the presence of guanethidine. 6. These findings indicate that the precocious inflammation acts only at postsynaptic level, facilitating vascular contraction.

The left anterior descending artery (LAD) in isolated pig hearts was cannulated to maintain adequate perfusion of the LAD bed (2.2-2.8 ml/min/g). Rb(+) loading was initiated by switching perfusion to Rb(+)-containing Krebs-Henseleit (KH) buffer in the presence of 0.1 microM dobutamine, 0.5 microM propranolol, or no drug (control), and the LAD flow was reduced to 10% of the baseline for 120 min. The flow through the LAD was then restored to normal and the drugs were removed. In all groups the rate of Rb(+) uptake obtained from serial (87)Rb images was severely depressed in the ischemic anterior wall relative to that in the normal posterior wall. Dobutamine increased the rate of Rb(+) uptake in the posterior wall (6.3% +/- 1.4% vs. 2.5% +/- 0.25% per minute in control) and did not affect the rate in the anterior wall (0.86% +/- 0.40% vs. 1.14% +/- 0.19% per minute in control). Propranolol did not affect Rb(+) uptake in either of these areas. We conclude that the stimulation of Rb(+) uptake by dobutamine is related to activation of Na(+)/K(+) ATPase and passive Na(+) influx in normal tissue. The lack of any effect of propranolol implies a low level of endogenous norepinephrine during low-flow (LF) ischemia.Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17112600>Disturbed in vitro adrenergic modulation of cytokine production in inflammatory bowel diseases in remission.</a></h2><p>Psychological stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of both inflammatory and functional gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. The goal of this study was to address neuroendocrine modulation of cytokine production by peripheral blood cells in GI diseases.We analyzed the in vitro effects of the beta-adrenergic agonist terbutaline and the glucocorticoid agonist dexamethasone on TNF-alpha and IL-10 production by LPS-stimulated monocytes in whole cell blood cultures in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases in remission (N=10), diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, N=12), patients with a recent gastroenteritis (post-infectious group, N=10), and healthy controls (N=15).In response to terbutaline, there was a significant increase in IL-10 production (concentration effect: p<0.05), which was diminished in  (group effect: p<0.01), comparable in IBS and controls, but enhanced in the post-infectious group (group x concentration effect: p<0.05). In contrast, terbutaline resulted in a concentration-dependent suppression of TNF-alpha production, which was comparable in all groups. Dexamethasone suppressed TNF-alpha production in a dose-dependent manner in all groups, but this effect was significantly more pronounced in post-infectious subjects (group effect: p<0.05).In , disturbed adrenergic regulation of IL-10 could be part of the mechanism(s) underlying the modulation of disease activity by psychological stress. Diarrhoea-predominant IBS was not associated with altered adrenergic or glucocorticoid regulation of cytokine production by peripheral blood cells, whereas a recent history of gastroenteritis was associated with disturbed neuroendocrine modulation of cytokine production, which may play role in the pathophysiology of post-infectious IBS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19714753>Platelet-activating factor-induced NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production in intestinal epithelial cells are Bcl10-dependent.</a></h2><p>Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent proinflammatory phospholipid mediator, has been implicated in inducing intestinal inflammation in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease () and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

Therefore, studies were designed to explore the mechanisms of PAF-induced inflammatory cascade in intestinal epithelial cells.Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation was measured by luciferase assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) production was determined by ELISA. B-cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10), caspase recruitment domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein 3 (CARMA3), and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) mRNA and protein levels were assessed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. siRNA silencing of Bcl10 was used to examine its role in PAF-induced NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production. The promoter region of the Bcl10 gene was cloned with the PCR method and promoter activity measured by luciferase assay.The adaptor protein Bcl10 appeared to play an important role in the PAF-induced inflammatory pathway in human intestinal epithelial cells. Bcl10 was required for PAF-induced I kappaB alpha phosphorylation, NF-kappaB activation, and IL-8 production in NCM460, a cell line derived from normal human colon, and Caco-2, a transformed human intestinal cell line. PAF also stimulated Bcl10 interactions with CARMA3 and MALT1, and upregulated Bcl10 expression in these cells via transcriptional regulation.These findings highlight a novel PAF-induced inflammatory pathway in intestinal epithelial cells, requiring Bcl10 as a critical mediator and involving CARMA3/Bcl10/MALT1 interactions. The proinflammatory effects of PAF play prominent roles in the pathogenesis of  and this pathway may present important targets for intervention in chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1665291>Inflammatory mediators in cotton-top tamarins (CTT) with acute and chronic colitis.</a></h2><p>Spontaneous colitis in CTT's presents cytological characteristics similar to chronic ulcerative colitis in humans, e.g. inflammatory cell infiltrate and crypt abscesses. To better characterize CTT colitis as a potential model for human inflammatory bowel disease (), inflammatory mediators identified in colonic tissue of human  patients and/or experimental colitis models were assayed. Inflammatory mediator changes in plasma and colon from tamarins with acute (n = 10) and chronic (n = 10) colitis (by mucosal biopsy) were assayed by RIAs. Similar inflammatory mediators were found in the CTT's with acute colitis. In the plasma, PAF and PGE2 levels were lower in acute colitis CTT's, no LTB4 was detected, and histamine levels were not different from chronic colitic animals. In the colon, myeloperoxidase and interleukin-1 beta were significantly higher in acute colitis, PGE2 and LTB4 were higher but not significantly, and PAF was not different from chronic CTT's. These data suggest that a combination of events are occurring in the pathogenesis of tamarin colitis that involves some of the same mediators that are found in the human disease and in other experimental models. The importance of these findings to human  remains for further investigation; however, the spontaneous primate model offers an exciting approximation of the disease development and merits further investigation for understanding the pathogenesis of human  as well as to aid in development of targeted therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28215162>Gut-brain Axis: Role of Lipids in the Regulation of Inflammation, Pain and CNS Diseases.</a></h2><p>The human gut is a composite anaerobic environment with a large, diverse and dynamic enteric microbiota, represented by more than 100 trillion microorganisms, including at least 1000 distinct species. The discovery that a different microbial composition can influence behavior and cognition, and in turn the nervous system can indirectly influence enteric microbiota composition, has significantly contributed to establish the well-accepted concept of gut-brain axis. This hypothesis is supported by several evidence showing mutual mechanisms, which involve the vague nerve, the immune system, the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis modulation and the bacteria-derived metabolites. Many studies have focused on delineating a role for this axis in health and disease, ranging from stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, and to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson Disease, Alzheimer's Disease etc. Based on this background, and considering the relevance of alteration of the symbiotic state between host and microbiota, this review focuses on the role and the involvement of bioactive lipids, such as the N-acylethanolamine (NAE) family whose main members are N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoilethanolamide (OEA), and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, belonging to a large group of bioactive lipids able to modulate peripheral and central pathologic processes. Their effective role has been studied in inflammation, acute and chronic pain, obesity and central nervous system diseases. A possible correlation has been shown between these lipids and gut microbiota through different mechanisms. Indeed, systemic administration of specific bacteria can reduce abdominal pain through the involvement of cannabinoid receptor 1 in the rat; on the other hand, PEA reduces inflammation markers in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease (), and butyrate, producted by gut microbiota, is effective in reducing inflammation and pain in irritable bowel syndrome and  animal models. In this review, we underline the relationship among inflammation, pain, microbiota and the different lipids, focusing on a possible involvement of NAEs and SCFAs in the gut-brain axis and their role in the central nervous system diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27609529>Faecal and Serum Metabolomics in Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is considered to result from the interplay between host and intestinal microbiota but its pathogenesis is incompletely understood. While IBD in adults has shown to be associated with marked changes in body fluid metabolomics, there are only few studies in children. Hence, this prospective study addressed the faecal and serum metabolomics in newly diagnosed paediatric IBD.Paediatric patients with IBD undergoing diagnostic endoscopies and controls also with endoscopy but no signs of inflammation provided blood and stool samples in a tertiary care hospital. Blood inflammatory markers and faecal calprotectin levels were determined. The serum and faecal metabolomics were determined using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer.Serum and faecal metabolite profiles in newly diagnosed paediatric IBD patients were different from healthy controls and categorized Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [UC] patients into separate groups. In serum, amino acid metabolism, folate biosynthesis and signalling pathways were perturbed in Crohn's disease; in UC also sphingolipid metabolic pathways were perturbed when compared to controls. In faecal samples, there was an increased level of several metabolites in UC in contrast to low or intermediate levels in Crohn's disease. There was a clear correlation with the level of inflammation, i.e. faecal calprotectin levels and the profile of various biologically important metabolites [carnosine, ribose and, most significantly, choline].Characterization of inflammatory pattern using metabolomics analysis is a promising tool for better understanding disease pathogenesis of paediatric IBD.Copyright © 2016 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

DS has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory effects on trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats and recently in UC patients in phase II PoC. There is Increasing evidence that Th17 cells have an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (). The aim of this study was to further characterize the anti-inflammatory effects of DS.Effect of DS (10 or 30 mg·kg(-1) b.i.d.) on TNBS-induced colitis in rats was studied after 2 and 7 days with special focus on inflammatory mediators. Additionally, its anti-inflammatory properties were analysed in two different models of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced colitis, BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, the latter being dependent on IL-17.DS, when administered for 7 days, showed intestinal anti-inflammatory effects in TNBS-induced colitis; these effects were observed both macroscopically and through the profile of inflammatory mediators (TNF, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-17). Although the 2 day treatment with DS did not induce intestinal anti-inflammatory effects, it was sufficient to reduce the enhanced IL-17 expression. DS showed beneficial effects on DSS-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice and reduced colonic pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-17. In contrast, it did not exert intestinal anti-inflammatory effects on DSS-induced colitis in BALB/c mice.DS exerts intestinal anti-inflammatory activity in different rodent models of colitis through down-regulation of IL-17 expression.© 2011 The Authors.

To evaluate the effect of intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) on increased intestinal permeability and its association with tight junction proteins, an in vitro intestinal epithelia barrier model was established with Caco-2 cells and treated with platelet-activating factor (PAF). We found that exposing cells to 0.3 M ITF (30 min before or 30 min after PAF treatment) attenuated the PAF-induced changes in transepithelial electrical resistance and Lucifer yellow flux. A quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis revealed that ITF suppressed PAF-induced downregulation of tight junction proteins claudin-1 and ZO-1 expression; furthermore, an abnormal localization and distribution of these proteins was inhibited, as assessed by immunofluorescence staining. These results suggest that ITF decreases mucosal permeability and shows potential as a therapy for treating .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17277153>FTY720 ameliorates Th1-mediated colitis in mice by directly affecting the functional activity of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells.</a></h2><p>Following the present concepts, the synthetic sphingosine analog of myriocin FTY720 alters migration and homing of lymphocytes via sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors. However, several studies indicate that the immunosuppressive properties of FTY720 may alternatively be due to tolerogenic activities via modulation of dendritic cell differentiation or based on direct effects on CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg). As Treg play an important role for the cure of inflammatory colitis, we used the Th1-mediated 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model to address the therapeutic potential of FTY720 in vivo. A rectal enema of TNBS was given to BALB/c mice. FTY720 was administered i.p. from days 0 to 3 or 3 to 5. FTY720 substantially reduced all clinical, histopathologic, macroscopic, and microscopic parameters of colitis analyzed. The therapeutic effects of FTY720 were associated with a down-regulation of IL-12p70 and subsequent Th1 cytokines. Importantly, FTY720 treatment resulted in a prominent up-regulation of FoxP3, IL-10, TGFbeta, and CTLA4. Supporting the hypothesis that FTY720 directly affects functional activity of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg, we measured a significant increase of CD25 and FoxP3 expression in isolated lamina propria CD4(+) T cells of FTY720-treated mice. The impact of FTY720 on Treg induction was further confirmed by concomitant in vivo blockade of CTLA4 or IL-10R which significantly abrogated its therapeutic activity. In conclusion, our data provide clear evidence that in addition to its well-established effects on migration FTY720 leads to a specific down-regulation of proinflammatory signals while simultaneously inducing functional activity of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg. Thus, FTY720 may offer a promising new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22623180>Novel treatments for NEC: keeping  in mind.</a></h2><p>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory intestinal disease of premature newborns, thought to result in part from overactivity of the innate immune system. NEC has been well-studied from the perspective of prevention; however, after the disease onset, there are limited treatment options to control its progression. This review discusses four potential therapies that target the overactive immune response in NEC: pentoxifylline, platelet activating factor modulators, glucocorticoids, and vasoactive substances. In addition, given the similar pathogenesis of NEC and inflammatory bowel disease (), we propose that  therapies could provide promising leads for novel strategies with which to treat NEC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10521992>Platelet activating factor in stool from patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>Platelet activating factor (PAF) is a potent endogenous mediator in inflammatory processes. The role of this mediator, especially in connection with the unknown etiology of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, remains poorly understood. A determination of PAF in stool may be helpful in recognizing quiescent inflammations in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. A simple and reliable method for the determination of PAF in stool seems to be necessary to achieve this goal.PAF analysis was performed with the help of a commercial PAF radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit after solid phase extraction (SPE) of ethanolic stool extracts. PAF was determined in stool from 10 healthy volunteers (m = 4; f = 6), 13 patients with ulcerative colitis (m = 7; f = 6) and 15 patients with Crohn's disease (m = 9; f = 6). Fecal PAF concentrations were compared with activity index of disease, endoscopic index, localization of lesions, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), medical prednisolone treatment, sex and age of the patients.In healthy volunteers, no PAF was detectable in stool. In patients with Crohn's disease 319.2 +/- 143.5 pg PAF/g stool and in patients with ulcerative colitis 824.9 +/- 408.7 pg PAF/g stool could be determined. A significant correlation (p < 0.05) was found between PAF-content in stool and the endoscopical index and intestinal localization of inflammatory lesions. No further correlations could be detected in our patients.Fecal PAF assessment may be used clinically as a non-invasive method to estimate severity of mucosal inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease ().</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526351>Docosahexaenoyl serotonin emerges as most potent inhibitor of IL-17 and CCL-20 released by blood mononuclear cells from a series of N-acyl serotonins identified in human intestinal tissue.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid amides (FAAs), conjugates of fatty acids with , mono-amine neurotransmitters or amino acids are a class of molecules that display diverse functional roles in different cells and tissues. Recently we reported that one of the serotonin-fatty acid conjugates, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), previously found in gut tissue of mouse and pig, attenuates the IL-23-IL-17 signaling axis in LPS-stimulated mice macrophages. However, its presence and effects in humans remained to be elucidated. Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty acid conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with palmitic acid (PA-5-HT), stearic acid (SA-5-HT) and oleic acid (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified. Among these, DHA-5-HT was the most potent in inhibiting IL-17 and CCL-20, typical Th17 pro-inflammatory mediators, by Concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human PBMCs. These results underline the idea that DHA-5-HT is a gut-specific endogenously produced mediator with the capacity to modulate the IL-17/Th17 signaling response. Our findings may be of relevance in relation to intestinal inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis.Copyright © 2017.

Among these, the  conjugate of the n-3 poly unsaturated long chain fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) (DHA) was shown to possess strong anti-inflammatory properties. Previously, we identified the serotonin conjugate of DHA, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), in intestinal tissues and showed that its levels are markedly influenced by intake of n-3 PUFAs. However, its biological roles remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that DHA-5-HT possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties by attenuating the IL-23-IL-17 signaling cascade in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Transcriptome analysis revealed that DHA-5-HT down-regulates LPS-induced genes, particularly those involved in generating a CD4+ Th17 response. Hence, levels of PGE2, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-23, all pivotal macrophage-produced mediators driving the activation of pathogenic Th17 cells in a concerted way, were found to be significantly suppressed by concentrations as low as 100-500nM DHA-5-HT. Furthermore, DHA-5-HT inhibited the ability of RAW264.7 cells to migrate and downregulated chemokines like MCP-1, CCL-20, and gene-expression of CCL-22 and of several metalloproteinases. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested negative overlap with gene sets linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and positive overlap with gene sets related to the Nrf2 pathway. The specific formation of DHA-5-HT in the gut, combined with increasing data underlining the importance of the IL-23-IL-17 signaling pathway in the etiology of many chronic inflammatory diseases merits further investigation into its potential as therapeutic compound in e.g. IBD or intestinal tumorigenesis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The actions of PEA are terminated following hydrolysis by 2 enzymes: fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and the less-studied N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA). This study aims to investigate the effects of inhibiting the enzymes responsible for PEA hydrolysis in colon inflammation in order to propose a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Two murine models of IBD were used to assess the effects of NAAA inhibition, FAAH inhibition, and PEA on macroscopic signs of colon inflammation, macrophage/neutrophil infiltration, and the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the colon, as well as on the colitis-related systemic inflammation. NAAA inhibition increases PEA levels in the colon and reduces colon inflammation and systemic inflammation, similarly to PEA. FAAH inhibition, however, does not increase PEA levels in the colon and does not affect the macroscopic signs of colon inflammation or immune cell infiltration. This is the first report of an anti-inflammatory effect of a systemically administered NAAA inhibitor. Because NAAA is the enzyme responsible for the control of PEA levels in the colon, we put forth this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammation in general and IBD in particular.© FASEB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18789113>Mobilization of bone marrow cells by leukocytapheresis in patients with ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>While several trials have suggested that leukocytapheresis by filtration can benefit patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC), mechanisms underlying these benefits are largely unknown. We studied how leukocytapheresis mobilizes bone marrow cells into the peripheral circulation in patients with active UC. Leukocytapheresis transiently reduced peripheral leukocytes, followed by an overshoot increase with emergence of immature leukocytes. The numbers of colonies and CD34(+) cells were comparable between UC patients and normal controls. Shortly after leukocytapheresis, the numbers of both colonies and CD34(+) cells increased significantly in UC patients (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0372, respectively). This was not associated with changes in the concentration of circulating cytokines or epinephrine. These results indicate that leukocytapheresis mobilizes bone marrow cells into the circulation. This cell replacement may partly explain the therapeutic benefit in UC.

These effects were explored in acutely and chronically inflamed colon, using inflammatory bowel disease and appendicitis explants.Caco-2 cells and human colonic explants collected from elective bowel cancer, inflammatory bowel disease () or acute appendicitis resections, and were treated with the following drug treatments: vehicle, an inflammatory protocol of interferon γ (IFNγ) and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα; 10 ng/ml), inflammation and PEA (10 µM), inflammation and CBD (10 µM), and PEA or CBD alone, CBD or vehicle were added simultaneously with IFNγ. Nine intracellular signalling phosphoproteins were determined by multiplex. Inflammatory cytokine secretion was determined using ELISA. Receptor mechanisms were investigated using antagonists for CB, CB, PPARα, PPARγ, TRPV1 and GPR55.IFNγ and TNFα treatment increased phosphoprotein and cytokine levels in Caco-2 cultures and colonic explants. Phosphoprotein levels were significantly reduced by PEA or CBD in Caco-2 cultures and colonic explants. CBD and PEA prevented increases in cytokine production in explant colon, but not in Caco-2 cells. CBD effects were blocked by the CB antagonist AM630 and TRPV1 antagonist SB366791. PEA effects were blocked by the PPARα antagonist GW6471. PEA and CBD were anti-inflammatory in  and appendicitis explants.PEA and CBD are anti-inflammatory in the human colon.
