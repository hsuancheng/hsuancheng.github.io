Eradication therapy using antibiotics is sometimes effective against gastrointestinal (GI) malignant lymphoma, suggesting that the tumor development or progression is affected by the inflammatory microenvironment. In the present study, serum samples from 148 patients with various subtypes of malignant lymphoma were tested for 11 proinflammatory Th1/Th2 cytokines. In the comparison by subtype or GI lesions, serum interleukin (IL)-8 (P = 6.-05), IL-4 (P = 7.-05), and IL-1β (P = 0.0043) levels showed significant differences among subtypes, being particularly elevated in follicular lymphomas (FL) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. Serum IL-8 levels were elevated in GI-FL and MALT lymphomas, and serum IL-4 and IL-1 β levels were elevated in MALT lymphomas. These findings show that GI low-grade B-cell lymphoma could develop against the background of an inflammatory microenvironment. Thus, these cytokines may be useful as diagnostic markers and could provide new insights into tumor development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25469663>Lutein derived fragments exhibit higher antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties than lutein in lipopolysaccharide induced  in rats.</a></h1><p>In the present study, we appraise the anti-inflammatory efficacy of lutein oxidative degradation derivatives mediated through UV-irradiation over lutein in counteracting the  induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats (n =  per group). UV-irradiated lutein fragments were identified as anhydrolutein (B, C40H54O), 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,4-dienylium (M1, C9H13), (2E,4E,6E,8E)-9-(4-hydroxy-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-1en-1-yl)-3,7-dimethylnona-2,4,6,8-tetraen-1-ylium (M2, C20H29O), 4-[(1E,3E,,)-3,7,-dimethyldeca-1,3,,7-tetraen-1-yl]-3,,-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-ol (M3, C21H30O) and zeaxanthin (M4, C40H56O) and its isomers as 13'-Z zeaxanthin, 13'-Z lutein, all-trans zeaxanthin, and 9-Z lutein. Induction of  by LPS significantly increased the production of nitrites (3.3 fold in the serum and 2.6 fold in the liver), prostaglandin E2 (26 fold in the serum), and pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α (6.6 fold in the serum), and interleukin-6 (4.8 fold in the serum). Oxidative derivatives of lutein, especially M1, M2 and M3, ameliorated acute  in rats by inhibiting the production of nitrites, malondialdehyde (MDA), PGE2, TNF-α, and IL-6 cytokines more efficiently than lutein in rats. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of derivatives might be related to the decrease of inflammatory cytokines and the increase of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S transferase, glutathione reductase), which would result in the reduction of iNOS, COX-2 and MDA and subsequently inflammatory responses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26869203>A semi-synthetic natural product blocks collagen induced arthritis by preferentially suppressing the production of IL-6.</a></h1><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune-inflammatory disease is characterized by dysregulation of signal transduction pathways, increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhanced leukocyte infiltration into synovial microvascular endothelium, extensive formation of hyper proliferative pannus, degradation of cartilage and bone erosion. Several compounds that abrogate cytokine production demonstrate a therapeutic effect in experimental models of arthritis. In this study, we report that a novel semi-synthetic natural product (Compound A) being a preferential IL-6 inhibitor, is efficacious in a murine model of arthritis. In vitro evaluations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production reveal that Compound A preferentially inhibits induced production of IL-6 and not TNF-α from THP-1 cells and isolated human monocytes. Furthermore, Compound A robustly inhibits the spontaneous production of IL-6 from pathologically relevant synovial tissue cells isolated from patients with active RA. In a physiologically relevant assay, Compound A selectively inhibits the activated T cell contact-mediated production of IL-6 from human monocytes. Compound A, at pharmacologically efficacious concentrations, does not significantly curtail the LPS-induced activation of p38 MAPKs. In the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model (i) macroscopic observations demonstrate that Compound A, administered subcutaneously in a therapeutic regimen, significantly and dose-dependently inhibits disease associated increases in articular index and paw thickness; (ii) histological analyses of paw tissues reveal that Compound A prominently diminishes joint destruction, hyperproliferative pannus formation and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Collectively, these results provide direct evidence that Compound A, a novel preferential IL-6 inhibitor, suppresses collagen-induced arthritis, and may be a potential therapeutic for treating patients with active RA.Copyright © 2016.

A detailed investigation into the generation of these metabolites has been overlooked.We investigated the kinetics of nitrite and S-nitrosothiol-hemoglobin (SNO-Hb) in plasma derived from inhaled NO subjects and how this modifies the cutaneous microvascular response.We enrolled 15 healthy volunteers. Plasma nitrite levels at baseline and during NO inhalation (15 minutes at 40 ppm) were 102 (86-118) and 114 (87-129) nM, respectively. The nitrite peak occurred at  minutes of discontinuing NO (131 (104-170) nM). Plasma nitrate levels were not significantly different during the study. SNO-Hb molar ratio levels at baseline and during NO inhalation were 4.-3 (2.-3-.8E-3) and 7.8E-3 (4.1E-3-13.0E-3), respectively. Levels of SNO-Hb continued to climb up to the last study time point (30 min: 10.6E-3 (.3E-3-15.-3)). The response to acetylcholine iontophoresis both before and during NO inhalation was inversely associated with the SNO-Hb level (r: -0.57, p = 0.03, and r: -0.54, p = 0.04, respectively).Both nitrite and SNO-Hb increase during NO inhalation. Nitrite increases first, followed by a more sustained increase in Hb-SNO. Nitrite and Hb-SNO could be a mobile reservoir of NO with potential implications on the systemic microvasculature.</p></html>
