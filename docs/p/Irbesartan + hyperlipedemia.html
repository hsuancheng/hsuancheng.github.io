Thus, a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of anti-HTN drugs and statins may be useful for treating CVD. This study evaluated the efficacy of an FDC of  and atorvastatin (Rovelito) in Korean patients.Patients with HTN and hypercholesterolemia were screened for this prospective, observational, descriptive, multi-center, phase IV study. Eligible patients were administered with Rovelito for 3 months. Dose adjustment was allowed based on the physician's discretion. Blood pressure (BP) goal was <140/90 mmHg, and blood lipid goal was based on Adult Treatment Panel III. Compliance with therapeutic lifestyle modification and safety of the study drugs were evaluated.Of the 2,777 patients enrolled in this study, 931 were analyzed for clinical efficacy. BP and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals were achieved in 801 (86.04%) and 797 (85.61%) patients, respectively. For the BP goal, higher baseline BP and higher body mass index were risk factors for treatment failure. For LDL-C goal, baseline LDL-C level, number of concomitant drugs, smoking status, and alcohol consumption were risk factors for treatment failure. Of the 931 participants, 694 (74.54%) achieved the treatment goals for both BP and LDL-C. Smoking status, alcohol consumption, number of concomitant drugs, and higher baseline LDL-C and BP levels were risk factors for treatment failure in both BP and LDL-C goals. Adherence with Rovelito was 97.90%±5.79%, and incidence of adverse events was 4.19% (116).FDC of  and atorvastatin (Rovelito) could be extremely helpful in treating patients with both HTN and hypercholesterolemia. Poor metabolic profiles were risk factors for poor treatment response and the reason for choosing Rovelito. Therapeutic lifestyle modification should still be underscored despite the 75% treatment success rate with Rovelito for both conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27919004> ameliorates  and liver steatosis in type 2 diabetic db/db mice via stimulating PPAR-γ, AMPK/Akt/mTOR signaling and autophagy.</a></h2><p> (Irb), a unique subset of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with PPAR-γ activation function, has been reported to play a role in renal dysfunction, glucose metabolism, and abnormal lipid profile in diabetic animal models and humans. However, the underlying mechanisms that improve  and liver steatosis are unclear. This study investigated the effects of Irb on lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis using the spontaneous type 2 diabetic db/db mouse model. The results demonstrated body and liver weight, food consumption, lipid content in serum and liver tissue, and liver dysfunction as well as hepatic steatosis were increased in db/db mice compared with db/m mice, whereas the increases were reversed by Irb treatment. Moreover, Irb administration resulted in an increase in LC3BII as well as the LC3BII/I ratio through activating PPAR-γ and p-AMPK and inhibiting p-Akt and p-mTOR, thereby inducing autophagy in the db/db mouse liver. Therefore, our findings suggest that Irb can ameliorate  and liver steatosis by upregulating the expression of PPAR-γ, activating the AMPK/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and inducing liver autophagy.Copyright © 2016.

A 58-year-old man is presented including the clinical and laboratory findings, cardiovascular profile and thrombophilia screening. The patient presented with 3/10 vision and an inferior altitudinal defect in the right eye. Funduscopic examination of the right eye revealed a hyperemic optic disk with blurred superior optic disk border and sectoral nerve fiber layer edema. Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were normal, suggesting a NAION. A workup of cardiovascular risk factors revealed , arterial hypertension and high-risk asymptomatic coronary artery disease. Due to the family history of deep vein thrombosis in the patient's daughter, a thrombophilia screening was additionally performed. The results revealed a double thrombophilic defect, namely congenital protein S deficiency and heterozygosity for prothrombin G20210A mutation, which were also identified in the patient's daughter. Anticoagulant warfarin therapy was initiated and the patient underwent a triple bypass surgery. At three-month follow-up, the right optic disk edema had resolved, leaving a pale superior optic nerve head. Visual acuity in the right eye had slightly improved to 4/10; however, the dense inferior altitudinal field defect had remained unchanged. The patient is currently treated with warfarin, atorvastatin,  and metoprolol. This case suggests that the first line of investigation in all patients with NAION involves assessment of cardiovascular risk factors. However, careful history taking will identify NAION patients who are eligible for additional thrombophilia screening: young patients without vasculopathic risk factors, bilateral or recurrent NAION, idiopathic or recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), positive family history of VTE, and VTE in young age or in unusual sites (e.g. cerebral, hepatic, mesenteric, or renal vein).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26321089> can improve blood lipid and the kidney function of diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease.

Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol may induce upregulation of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1)-receptors and their activation plays a pathogenetic role in atherosclerosis, possibly via enhanced breakdown of nitric oxide. We tested whether AT1-receptor blockade improved endothelial function of the retinal vasculature in normocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic subjects.Thirty-one hypercholesterolemic and 17 normocholesterolemic subjects were randomly assigned to treatment with  and placebo in a double-blind crossover study. Retinal capillary flow was measured using scanning laser Doppler flowmetry. Diffuse luminance flicker was applied to provoke vasodilation that is in part nitric oxide dependent.Flicker-induced increases in retinal capillary flow were similar between hypercholesterolemic and normocholesterolemic subjects. In contrast to placebo, treatment with  led to a significant reduction of blood pressure, in our patients with normal blood pressure values. Therefore we divided our study cohort according to the median blood pressure reduction in response to . Flicker-induced increases in retinal capillary flow were substantially higher in subjects with a systolic blood pressure reduction above median (> 6 mmHg) than in those with a reduction below median (<or=6 mmHg) (16.2 +/- 16% versus 6.88 +/- 11%; P = 0.042).AT1-receptor blockade with  improves endothelial function of the retinal vasculature, taken as a model of cerebral circulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16820589>Endothelial Protection, AT1 blockade and Cholesterol-Dependent Oxidative Stress: the EPAS trial.</a></h2><p>Statins and angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. In the Endothelial Protection, AT1 blockade and Cholesterol-Dependent Oxidative Stress (EPAS) trial, impact of independent or combined statin and AT1 receptor blocker therapy on endothelial expression of anti-atherosclerotic and proatherosclerotic genes and endothelial function in arteries of patients with coronary artery disease were tested.Sixty patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery were randomized 4 weeks before surgery to: (A) control without inhibition of renin-angiotensin system or statin; (B) statin (pravastatin 40 mg/d); (C) AT1 blockade ( 150 mg/d); or (D) combination of statin and AT1 blocker in same dosages. Primary end point was a priori therapy-dependent regulation of an anti-atherosclerotic endothelial expression quotient Q including mRNA expression (in arbitrary units measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction) of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and C-type natriuretic peptide, divided by expression of oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor LOX-1 and NAD(P)H oxidase subunit gp91phox in left internal mammary arteries biopsies obtained by CABG surgery; 49 patients completed the study. Statin therapy increased lnQ from 3.2+/-0.4 to 4.4+/-0.4 significantly versus control. AT(1) blockade showed a trend to increase lnQ to 4.2+/-0.5. Combination of statin and AT1 blocker further increased lnQ to 5.1+/-0.6, but a putative interaction of both therapies in lnQ was not significant. Furthermore, preoperative therapy with statin, AT1 blocker and their combination improved endothelial function in internal mammary artery rings.Statin and AT1 blocker therapy independently and in combination improve an anti-atherosclerotic endothelial expression quotient and endothelial function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25264877>Statin treatment in hypercholesterolemic men does not attenuate angiotensin II-induced venoconstriction.</a></h2><p>Experimental studies suggested that statins attenuate vascular AT1 receptor responsiveness. Moreover, the augmented excessive pressor response to systemic angiotensin II infusions in hypercholesterolemic patients was normalized with statin treatment. In 12 hypercholesterolemic patients, we tested the hypothesis that statin treatment attenuates angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction in hand veins assessed by a linear variable differential transducer. Subjects ingested daily doses of either atorvastatin (40 mg) or positive control  (150 mg) for 30 days in a randomized and cross-over fashion. Ang II-induced venoconstriction at minute 4 averaged 59%±10% before and 28%±9% after  (mean ± SEM; P<0.05) compared to 65%±11% before and 73%±11% after 30 days of atorvastatin treatment. Plasma angiotensin levels increased significantly after  treatment (Ang II: 17±22 before vs 52±40 pg/mL after [p = 0.048]; Ang-(1-7): 18±10 before vs 37±14 pg/mL after [p = 0.002]) compared to atorvastatin treatment (Ang II: 9±4 vs 11±10 pg/mL [p = 0.40]; Ang-(1-7): 24±9 vs 32±8 pg/mL [p = 0.023]). Our study suggests that statin treatment does not elicit major changes in angiotensin II-mediated venoconstriction or in circulating angiotensin II levels whereas angiotensin-(1-7) levels increased modestly. The discrepancy between local vascular and systemic angiotensin II responses might suggest that statin treatment interferes with blood pressure buffering reflexes.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15662225>Enhanced angiotensin II-mediated effects in fibroblasts of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by a high incidence of coronary heart disease. Evidence suggests an important role for angiotensin II (AngII) in the fibrotic response to tissue injury, and in promoting myocardial hypertrophy via paracrine mechanisms mediated by fibroblasts. We sought to determine whether AngII promotes proliferative and pro-atherogenic responses in FH patients.We used primary fibroblasts -- from five patients with heterozygous FH and five control subjects (C) -- to study AngII-induced cell growth, intracellular calcium fluxes, and expression/release of matrix components and pro-inflammatory peptides [transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) and endothelin-1 (ET-1)] and metalloproteinases involved in plaque remodeling and vulnerability.AngII stimulated cell replication (5.1 +/- 0.03 versus 3.2 +/- 0.04 cells/50 cells per well, P < 0.001), and induced a larger increase in intracellular calcium content in FH cells than in C cells, in a dose-dependent fashion (mean difference = 76 nmol/l, P < 0.001). Similarly, TGFbeta1 and ET-1 expression and release were potentiated (after 24-h incubation with 1 micromol/l AngII: TGFbeta1 was 190 +/- 12 in C and 376 +/- 9 pg/ml per 10(6) cells in FH, and ET-1 was 93 +/- 5 in C and 192 +/- 7 pmol/ml per 10(6) cells in FH; P < 0.001 for both). AngII-induced release of the metalloproteinases MMP-1 and MMP-2 was also increased in FH versus C cells (0.52 +/- 0.04 versus 0.36 +/- 0.05 and 24 +/- 4 versus 13 +/- 3 ng/mg protein with 1 micromol/l AngII). These enhanced responses were likely due to an increased angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) expression in cells from FH patients induced by AngII, and were prevented by pretreating cells with the selective AT1 antagonist .These findings show that some AngII-mediated pathways are enhanced in FH subjects irrespective of the presence of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), thus contributing to the development and progression of atherosclerosis in these patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15867169>Effect of atorvastatin and , alone and in combination, on postprandial endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation in type 2 diabetic patients.</a></h2><p>Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia are considered risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Evidence suggests that postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia induce endothelial dysfunction and inflammation through oxidative stress. Statins and angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, improving endothelial function.Twenty type 2 diabetic patients ate 3 different test meals: a high-fat meal, 75 g glucose alone, and a high-fat meal plus glucose. Glycemia, triglyceridemia, endothelial function, nitrotyrosine, C-reactive protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and interleukin-6 were assayed during the tests. Subsequently, diabetics took atorvastatin 40 mg/d,  300 mg/d, both, or placebo for 1 week. The 3 tests were performed again between 5 and 7 days after the start of each treatment. High-fat load and glucose alone produced a decrease in endothelial function and increases in nitrotyrosine, C-reactive protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and interleukin-6. These effects were more pronounced when high-fat load and glucose were combined. Short-term atorvastatin and  treatments significantly counterbalanced these phenomena, and their combination was more effective than either therapy alone.This study confirms an independent and cumulative effect of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia on endothelial function and inflammation, suggesting oxidative stress as a common mediator of such an effect. Short-term treatment with atorvastatin and  may counterbalance this phenomenon; the combination of the 2 compounds is most effective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24065095>Potential of the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) telmisartan, , and candesartan for inhibiting the HMGB1/RAGE axis in prevention and acute treatment of stroke.</a></h2><p>Stroke is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide. The main cause of stroke is atherosclerosis, and the most common risk factor for atherosclerosis is hypertension. Therefore, antihypertensive treatments are recommended for the prevention of stroke. Three angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), telmisartan,  and candesartan, inhibit the expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), which is one of the pleiotropic effects of these drugs. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is the ligand of RAGE, and has been recently identified as a lethal mediator of severe sepsis. HMGB1 is an intracellular protein, which acts as an inflammatory cytokine when released into the extracellular milieu. Extracellular HMGB1 causes multiple organ failure and contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension, , diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and stroke. This is the first review of the literature evaluating the potential of three ARBs for the HMGB1-RAGE axis on stroke therapy, including prevention and acute treatment. This review covers clinical and experimental studies conducted between 1976 and 2013. We propose that ARBs, which inhibit the HMGB1/RAGE axis, may offer a novel option for prevention and acute treatment of stroke. However, additional clinical studies are necessary to verify the efficacy of ARBs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11090544>Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein serine 239 phosphorylation as a sensitive monitor of defective nitric oxide/cGMP signaling and endothelial dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Studies with cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGK-I)-deficient human cells and mice demonstrated that cGK-I ablation completely disrupts the NO/cGMP pathway in vascular tissue, which indicates a key role of this protein kinase as a mediator of the NO/cGMP action. Analysis of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylated at serine 239 (P-VASP) is a useful tool to monitor cGK-I activation in platelets and cultured endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Therefore, we investigated whether endothelial dysfunction and/or vascular NO bioavailability is reflected by decreased vessel wall P-VASP and whether improvement of endothelial dysfunction restores this P-VASP. Incubation of aortic tissue from New Zealand White Rabbits with the NOS inhibitor N:(G)-nitro-Ld-arginine and endothelial removal strikingly reduced P-VASP. Oxidative stress induced by inhibition of CuZn superoxide dismutase increased superoxide and decreased P-VASP. Endothelial dysfunction in hyperlipidemic Watanabe rabbits (WHHL) was associated with increased vascular superoxide and with decreased P-VASP. Treatment of WHHL with AT(1) receptor blockade improved endothelial dysfunction, reduced vascular superoxide, increased vascular NO bioavailability, and increased P-VASP. Therefore, the level of vessel P-VASP closely follows changes in endothelial function and vascular oxidative stress. P-VASP is suggested to represent a novel biochemical marker for monitoring the NO-stimulated sGC/cGK-I pathway and endothelial integrity in vascular tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19028402>Molecular mechanisms of  suppressing atherosclerosis in high cholesterol-diet apolipoprotein E knock-out mice.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays an important role. Evidence indicate that the angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers can suppress atherogenesis, but the exact mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. The study was undertaken to investigate the potential effects and molecular mechanisms of an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker  on atherogenesis in high cholesterol-diet apolipoprotein E knock-out mice.Adult male apolipoprotein E knock-out mice were given normal diet or high cholesterol-diet and randomized to receive no treatment or  10 mg kg(-1) d(-1) for 12 weeks. The apolipoprotein E knock-out mice with high cholesterol-diet were associated with a marked increase in atherosclerotic lesion area, plasma lipid and angiotensin II levels, as well as the expressions of angiotensin type 1 receptor in the aorta. High cholesterol-diet feeding increases the activity of NADPH oxidase subunits (p47(phox) and Rac), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, janus kinase 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, nuclear factor-kappaB and the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 6, monocyte chemoattactant protein-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in the aortas. These changes were suppressed in mice that were treated with  10 mg kg(-1) d(-1), with no significant change in systolic blood pressure and plasma lipid levels.The results suggest that  can attenuate atherosclerosis, and this effect is partly related to the inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory signal transduction pathways which eventually leads to the decrease in the expression of inflammatory cytokines.Copyright  2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARBs) are effective antihypertensive drugs that have been reported to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) to differing extents, with favorable effects on glucose metabolism and the incidence of new-onset . Among the ARBs, telmisartan is a partial activator of PPARgamma,  is a weak partial activator, and olmesartan has no effect on PPARgamma activation.The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects on glucose homeostasis of combining rosuvastatin with ARBs of varying PPARgamma-activating potency in Greek adults with impaired fasting glucose, mixed dyslipidemia, and stage 1 hypertension.This was a 24-week, randomized, open-label study. Inclusion criteria were impaired fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (100-125 mg/dL [5.6-6.9 mmol/L]), mixed dyslipidemia (LDL-C >160 mg/dL [4.14 mmol/L] and triglycerides >150 mg/dL [1.69 mmol/L]), and stage 1 hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140-159 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90-99 mm Hg). After 12 weeks of dietary intervention, patients were randomly allocated to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg/d plus telmisartan 80 mg/d (RT group),  300 mg/d (RI group), or olmesartan 20 mg/d (RO group) for 24 weeks. The primary end point was change in the following indices of glucose metabolism after 6 months of treatment: FPG, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), HOMA of beta-cell function (HOMA-B), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)). Secondary end points included changes in anthropometric variables, blood pressure, serum lipids, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Tolerability was monitored throughout the study.After the 12-week dietary intervention, 151 white patients (78 female, 73 male) met the inclusion criteria and were randomized to receive RT (n = 52), RI (n = 48), or RO (n = 51). The mean (SD) age of the 3 groups was 60 (10), 60 (10), and 58 (12) years, respectively; their mean weight was 79 (11), 81 (12), and 78 (11) kg. At 6 months, the RT group had a 29% decrease in HOMA-IR (from a median [range] of 2.6 [0.6-6.6] to 1.8 [0.5-5.1]), the RI group had a 16% increase (from 2.5 [0.5-6.2] to 2.9 [0.5-8.1]), and the RO group had a 14% increase (from 2.4 [0.5-7.9] to 2.7 [0.5-5.2]) (all, P < 0.05 vs baseline). The improvement in the RT group was statistically significant compared with the RI group (P < 0.01) and the RO group (P < 0.05). The changes from baseline in FPG and HbA(1c) were not significant in any group. Fasting serum insulin decreased by 21% in the RT group (from 10.4 [2.4-28.1] to 8.2 [2.4-18.8] microU/mL), whereas it increased by 12% in the RI group (from 9.1 [2.0-26.5] to 10.2 [2.0-25.2] microU/mL) and by 8% in the RO group (from 10.1 [2.0-29.6] to 10.9 [2.0-19.1] microU/mL) (all, P < 0.05 vs baseline). Again, there was a significant difference between the RT group and the RI group (P < 0.01) and RO group (P < 0.05). Levels of hs-CRP decreased by 44% in the RT group (from 2.2 [0.3-7.9] to 1.2 [0.4-7.0] mg/L), by 12% in the RI group (from 2.2 [0.3-12.3] to 1.9 [0.2-11.4] mg/L), and by 22% in the RO group (from 2.1 [0.7-4.0] to 1.7 [0.7-6.2] mg/L). The difference was statistically significant for the RT group compared with baseline and with the RI and RO groups (all comparisons, P < 0.05). Blood pressure was significantly reduced from baseline in all 3 groups, with no significant differences between groups. No serious adverse events were reported during the study, nor were there any clinically significant elevations in aminotransferases or creatine kinase.In this small, randomized, open-label study, the RT combination had favorable effects on HOMA-IR, fasting serum insulin, and hs-CRP compared with the RI and RO combinations in Greek adults with impaired fasting glucose, mixed hyperlipidemia, and stage 1 hypertension.Copyright  2010 Excerpta Medica Inc.

However, the direct effects of hypercholesterolemia on the myocardium and mechanisms are not completely understood. It has been demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) ligand agonists attenuate cardiac hypertrophy through anti-inflammatory effects. The present study investigated the effects of PPARgamma agonists on hypercholesterolemia-dependent, renin-angiotensin-system-related cardiac hypertrophy. The findings showed that left ventricular hypertrophy, eminent cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and lipid deposits in myocardium were observed in the rats fed a cholesterol-rich diet for 6 months, while these characteristic pathological alterations and the increase in angiotensin II (ANG II) level and over-expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) in the left ventricular tissues induced by the cholesterol-rich diet were significantly suppressed to equal extents by rosiglitazone and . In contrast, expression of angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT(2)R) was upregulated by these two drugs. In addition, lipid metabolism was markedly improved. The above findings suggest that the cardioprotection of the PPARgamma agonist against cardiac hypertrophy evoked by hypercholesterolemia in rats is mediated partially by the improvement of lipid profile, the reduction of ANG II level in the local tissue along with the downregulation of AT(1)R expression, and upregulation of AT(2)R expression.2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26250359>Characterization of subgroups of heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction with possible implications for prognosis and treatment response.</a></h2><p>Patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) have a poor prognosis, and no therapies have been proven to improve outcomes.

The two subgroups with the worst event-free survival in both studies were characterized by a high prevalence of obesity, , diabetes mellitus, anaemia, and renal insufficiency (Subgroup C) and by female predominance, advanced age, lower body mass index, and high rates of atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, renal insufficiency, and anaemia (Subgroup F).Using a data-driven approach, we identified HFpEF subgroups with significantly different prognoses. Further development of this approach for characterizing HFpEF subgroups is warranted.© 2015 The Authors European Journal of Heart Failure © 2015 European Society of Cardiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14728886>[Renal protective effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonist on growth hormone-treated nephrotic rats].</a></h2><p>Children with nephrotic syndrome are always associated with retardation of growth. Growth hormone (GH) administration to these children can stimulate their growth, but it plays an important role in glomerulosclerosis. Thus these children would take a risk to use it to improve their growth. This study was designed to investigate the effect of GH on the kidney of rats with adriamycin-induced nephropathy (AN) and its mechanism, and to observe the renoprotective effect of angiotensin II (AngII) receptor antagonist, , in GH-treated AN rats.Rats were divided into the following groups: normal control rats, AN rats, GH-treated AN rats and GH plus -treated AN rats. There were 8 developing male SD rats (120-130 g) in each group. Urinary protein was measured at weeks 3, 6 and 9. Blood pressure, serum creatinine, BUN, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride, as well as ACE activity and AngII concentration of the kidney were detected at the end of the study. Renal pathological changes were evaluated also. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the protein expressions of TGF beta(1), collagen IV and fibronectin in glomeruli.Glomerular sclerosis score of GH-treated AN rats (49.4 +/- 9.8) was significantly higher than that of AN rats (12.8 +/- 5.5, P < 0.01), and this score of GH-treated AN rats plus  (26.2 +/- 7.5) was significantly lower than the score of GH-treated AN rats (P < 0.01). The changes of urinary protein,  and hypoalbuminemia in rats of each group consisted with the degree of glomerular injury in rats of each group. There was azotemia in GH-treated AN rats, but rats in the other groups did not have azotemia. ACE activity of kidney was significantly (P < 0.01) increased in GH-treated AN rats [(28.1 +/- 4.1) U/mg pro] and GH-treated AN rats plus  [(27.6 +/- 3.4) U/mg pro] compared with that in AN rats [(14.6 +/- 4.4) U/mg pro]. AngII concentrations in the kidney of GH-treated AN rats [(17.8 +/- 3.3) pg/mg pro] and GH-treated AN rats plus  [(27.3 +/- 5.1) pg/mg pro] were significantly higher than that in AN rats [(8.3 +/- 1.9) pg/mg pro] (P < 0.01). The protein expressions of TGF-beta(1), collagen IV and fibronectin in GH-treated AN rats were the most distinct in all groups. These expressions were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in GH-treated AN rats plus .GH is able to exacerbate adriamycin-induced nephropathy in rats, which was partly through activating renal tissue RAS and initiating the function of the AngII-TGF beta(1)-ECM axis. Angiotensin II receptor antagonist, , has some renal protective effects on AN rats treated with GH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12838494>Outcome studies in diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Outcome studies in diabetic nephropathy have focused on strategies to prevent progression of diabetic nephropathy, the leading cause of ESRD in the United States. Once diabetics develop overt nephropathy, prognosis is poor. Risk factors for diabetic nephropathy are discussed, and include hyperglycemia, hypertension, angiotensin II, proteinuria, dyslipidemia, smoking, and anemia. Major outcomes as well as outcome studies in diabetic nephropathy for patients with microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria are reviewed. Furthermore, the role of therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists as well as selected combination therapy are discussed. Recommendations for therapy with ace inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are made based on this evidence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20961397>Platelet activation in hypertension associated with hypercholesterolemia: effects of .</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine the effect of simultaneous hypertension and hypercholesterolemia on platelet activation, nitric oxide (NO) production and oxidative stress, and to evaluate the role of , an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist.Golden Syrian hamsters were divided into three groups: controls, C (fed a standard diet); hypertensive-hypercholesterolemic, HH (fed a diet enriched in 3% cholesterol, 15% butter and 8% NaCl, for 4 months); and hypertensive-hypercholesterolemic treated with , HHI (fed as HH group, plus  10 mg kg(-1) per day, for 4 months).Compared with the C group, platelets isolated from the HH group showed: morphological modifications; increased integrin β3 exposure and protein expression of P-selectin, FAK, PI3K, Akt and Src; reduced eNOS protein expression and NO production; higher generation of ROS, mostly produced by NADPH-oxidase, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and 12-lipoxygenase; and enhanced NAD(P)H oxidase activity and protein expression of gp91phox and p22phox subunits, 12-lipoxygenase, COX-1, cPLA(2) and PKC. Compared with the HH group, the treatment with  (HHI group) significantly attenuates the changes in all the molecules tested, reduces platelet aggregation, and improves intraplatelet redox balance.Experimental hypertension associated with hypercholesterolemia produces major changes in morphology, signaling mechanisms and oxidative stress in blood platelets.

The expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) p65 in the myocardium was assessed with immunohistochemistry, the protein levels of P-IκBα ,IκBα and β-actin were analyzed with Western blotting, and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA were detected using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).Compared with db/+ mice, the saline-treated db/db mice developed obesity, hyperglycemia and  (P<0.01). Histopathological examination of the heart tissue revealed inflammatory cell infiltration, increased myocardial interstitium and disorders of myocardial fiber arrangement. The diabetic mice showed increased P-IαBα and decreased IκBα protein levels, enhanced activity and expression of NF-κB in the hearts, and increased mRNA expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in the myocardium. These abnormalities were all associated with increased inflammatory response.

Wild-type (C57BL/6J), ApoE-/-, AT1-/-, and ApoE-/--AT1-/- mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 7 weeks. In contrast to wild-type and AT1-/- mice, this treatment led to severe atherosclerotic lesion formation in the aortic sinus and the aorta (oil red O staining) and to an impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation (organ chamber experiments with isolated aortic segments) in ApoE-/- mice. In the age-matched ApoE-/--AT1-/- littermates, development of diet-induced endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic lesion formation was profoundly inhibited. Concomitantly, aortic release of superoxide radicals was increased 2-fold in ApoE-/- mice compared with wild-type animals, whereas aortic superoxide production was normalized in ApoE-/--AT1-/- mice (L-012 chemiluminescence). There were no significant differences in plasma cholesterol levels between ApoE-/- and ApoE-/--AT1-/- animals. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in ApoE-/--AT1-/- animals than in ApoE-/- mice (tail-cuff measurements). Oral treatment of ApoE-/- mice with either hydralazine or  reduced systolic blood pressure to the same level; however, only AT1 receptor antagonist treatment reduced atherosclerotic lesion formation and improved endothelial function.Genetic disruption of the AT1A receptor leads to inhibition of vascular oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and atherosclerotic lesion formation in ApoE-/- mice irrespective of blood pressure and plasma cholesterol levels.

It may also improve patient drug compliance to help control risk factors of cardiovascular disease. This study was designed to evaluate the blood pressure-lowering and cholesterol-lowering effect of a fixed-dose combination of -atorvastatin compared with monotherapy by either agent over an 8-week treatment period.Patients with comorbid hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were screened for this randomized, double-blind, Phase III study. Eligible study patients were randomly assigned to test groups receiving a combination of  300 mg and atorvastatin 40 mg or 80 mg (IRB300 + ATO40 and IRB300 + ATO80). Comparator groups comprised monotherapy groups with  300 mg (IRB300) or atorvastatin 40 mg (ATO40) or atorvastatin 80 mg (ATO80), or placebo. Patients who were eligible at screening were subjected to a 4- to 6-week washout period before commencing 8 weeks of therapy per their assigned group. The primary efficacy end points were percent change in LDL-C and sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels from baseline to end of therapy. Tolerability profiles of combination therapy were compared with other groups.A total of 733 patients with comorbid hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were screened for this study; 230 eligible patients were randomized to treatment. The mean age of patients was 58.9 (8.5) years, and their mean body mass index was 25.8 (3.2) kg/m. More than two thirds (70.9%) of the study patients were male. Mean LDL-C and sitting DBP levels at baseline were 149.54 (29.19) mg/dL and 92.32 (6.03) mm Hg, respectively. Percent reductions in LDL-C after 8 weeks were 46.74% (2.06%) in the IRB300 + ATO40 group and 48.98% (2.12%) in the IRB300 + ATO80 group; these values were 47.13% (3.21%) and 48.30% (2.98%) in the ATO40 and ATO80 comparator groups. Similarly, a reduction in sitting DBP after 8 weeks was -8.50 (1.06) mm Hg in the IRB300 + ATO40 group and 10.66 (1.08) mm Hg in the IRB300 + ATO80 group compared with 8.40 (1.65) mm Hg in the IRB300 group.

These drugs may also exert beneficial metabolic effects, causing improved glucose tolerance in patients. Gender-related differences have also been observed in the clinical responsiveness to these drugs, but the mechanism behind this is unclear. In the present study, we have investigated whether these drugs and the fatty acid palmitate influence the pancreatic microcirculation, thereby having an impact on insulin secretion and glycaemia in vivo, in spontaneously diabetic male and female Goto-Kakizaki rats. In male rats, pancreatic IBF (islet blood flow) and total PBF (pancreatic blood flow) were increased significantly by pravastatin, captopril and . Serum insulin levels were increased by pravastatin and captopril. Palmitate suppressed pancreatic IBF and increased blood glucose. In female animals, pancreatic IBF was stimulated by captopril, candesartan and . Total PBF was increased by captopril, candesartan and , and by pravastatin. Palmitate suppressed pancreatic IBF and serum insulin secretion. In conclusion, the present study lends support to the view that a local pancreatic RAS (renin-angiotensin system) and pravastatin may be selectively influencing the pancreatic microcirculation and therefore affecting insulin secretion and glycaemia. NEFAs (non-esterified fatty acids) impaired pancreatic IBF, suppressed insulin secretion and increased blood glucose. Substantial gender-related differences in the vascular and metabolic responses to these drugs prevail in this animal model of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12020687>Two angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists,  and losartan, effects in cholesterol-fed rabbits.</a></h2><p>This study was performed to examine the long-term effects of  and losartan, two angiotensin (AT(1)) receptor antagonists, on lipoproteins and vascular responsiveness in vessels isolated from hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Four groups of rabbits (n=40) were used: Group 0 (control group), Group 1 [hypercholesterolemic group, 0.5% (wt./wt.) cholesterol-enriched diet], Group 2 (hypercholesterolemic+ 10 mg/kg/day) and Group 3 (hypercholesterolemic+losartan 10 mg/kg/day). After 17 weeks of treatment, total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins levels in - and losartan-treated groups were significantly lower than those of Group 1 (alpha=0.05). Furthermore, levels of high-density lipoproteins were higher in the treated groups than in the hypercholesterolemic (alpha=0.05) when we consider the same level of total cholesterol in the hypercholesterolemic and the treated groups. Despite the effect of the drugs on the abovementioned parameters, treatment with  or losartan did not improve endothelium-dependent and independent relaxation in aortic and mesenteric rings. Treatment with  and losartan decreased noradrenaline-induced contraction in aortic rings with respect to that in the hypercholesterolemic group (alpha=0.05). In addition,  treatment improved the increase in serotonin-induced contraction in proximal coronary arteries with respect to that in the hypercholesterolemic group (alpha=0.05).

Additionally, the experiments showed the potential of  to correct all altered parameters in HH and to mobilize EPCs by NO, chemokines and adhesion molecule-dependent mechanisms.Hypertension associated with hypercholesterolemia is accompanied by structural modifications and expression of pro-inflammatory molecules by the vessel wall, the alteration of vascular tone, enhanced release of MPs and reduced EPCs; the ratio between the latter two may be considered as a marker of vascular dysfunction. , which exhibits a pharmacological control on the levels of MPs and EPCs, has the potential to restore homeostasis of the arterial wall.© 2012 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12559676>Angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockade improves renal perfusion in hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>Hypercholesterolemia (HC) is a risk factor for renal disease that may activate the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor and accelerate renal damage. Early diet-induced HC impairs renal perfusion responses, but it is yet unknown whether the AT1 receptor is involved. This study tested the hypothesis that AT1 receptor blockade improved renal perfusion and functional responses in hypercholesterolemic pigs.Regional renal hemodynamics and function in vivo were quantified bilaterally in pigs, at baseline and during vasoactive challenge (acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside), using electron beam computed tomography after 12 weeks of normal (n = 6) or HC diet (n = 6), or HC diet supplemented (100 mg/d) with the AT1-receptor antagonist  (HC + AT1, n = 6).Basal cortical and medullary perfusion was similar among the groups. Basal tubular function was similar on normal and HC diets, whereas HC + AT1 showed decreased proximal and distal fluid reabsorption. Hypercholesterolemic pigs had blunted cortical perfusion (P = .22) and augmented tubular responses to acetylcholine, whereas on HC + AT1 diet, cortical perfusion (P = .002) and tubular function were similar to normal animals. This was associated with decreased systemic levels of the oxidative stress markers thiobarbituric acid reactive substances.The AT1 receptor blockade in HC improves renal perfusion and tubular functional responses to endothelium-dependent vasodilators, in association with a decrease in oxidative stress. These results imply involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the blunted renal cortical perfusion responses observed in HC, and suggest a potential role for these agents in preservation of intrarenal hemodynamics and function in HC.Copyright 2003 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.</p></html>
