<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26855320>Improvement of oral contraceptive-induced glucose dysregulation and dyslipidemia by valproic acid is independent of circulating corticosterone.</a></h2><p>Cardiometabolic disorders are rapidly becoming major public health challenges. Valproic acid (VPA) is a widely prescribed anticonvulsant drug.We hypothesized that treatment with VPA would improve the regulation of glucose and atherogenic dyslipidemia through reduction in circulating corticosterone.Female Wistar rats recieved (p.o.) combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing 1.0 µg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 µg  and valproic acid (VPA; 20 mg) for 8 weeks.Treatment with COC led to elevated fasting blood glucose, , corticosterone, triglycerides (TG), TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio,  (IR) and impaired glucose tolerance. VPA significantly attenuated the alterations induced by COC treatment, but did not affect the corticosterone level. However, VPA treatment led to significant increases in plasma , corticosterone, atherogenic lipids and impaired glucose tolerance in rats not treated with COC.The findings in this study suggest that VPA mitigates against the development of COC-induced  and dyslipidemia independent of elevated circulating corticosterone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30001502>Inhibition of adenosine deaminase and xanthine oxidase by valproic acid abates hepatic triglyceride accumulation independent of corticosteroids in female rats treated with estrogen-progestin.</a></h2><p>Elevated circulating uric acid has been postulated to play an important pathophysiological role in estrogen-progestin combined oral contraceptive (COC)-induced hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesized that disruption of glucoregulation and liver triglyceride (TG) accumulation induced by COC use would be abated by valproic acid (VPA) treatment through suppression of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities. Female Wistar rats aged 9-10 weeks were treated with a combination of estrogen-progestin COC steroids (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg ; p.o.) with or without VPA (100.0 mg/kg; p.o.) daily for 6 weeks. The result shows that the disrupted glucoregulation and associated elevated hepatic ADA activity, plasma and hepatic XO activity, uric acid (UA), TG/HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and malondialdehyde induced by COC treatment were attenuated by VPA treatment. However, VPA did not have any effect on plasma aldosterone, corticosterone, ADA, circulating and hepatic free  acid. Our results demonstrate that suppression of plasma and hepatic XO activities, along with hepatic ADA activity and UA by VPA treatment, protects against disrupted glucoregulation and increased liver TG by COC independent of elevated corticosteroids. The findings imply that VPA would provide protection against the development of cardiometabolic disorder via inhibition of the ADA/XO/UA-mediated pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31232280>Effect of letermovir on  and ethinyl estradiol pharmacokinetics .</a></h2><p>Letermovir is an inhibitor of the terminase complex of cytomegalovirus (CMV) used as prophylactic therapy in CMV-seropositive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. As the combination oral contraceptive (COC) /ethinyl estradiol (LNG/EE) may be coadministered in this target transplant population, the effects of letermovir on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LNG and EE were investigated.This was a phase I, open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period study conducted in healthy women (18 - 65 years old) of non-childbearing potential (protocol number: MK-8228 035). On day 1 of period 1, participants received a single dose of COC (LNG 0.15 mg/EE 0.03 mg). Following a 7-day washout, oral letermovir 480 mg was administered once-daily on days 1 - 12 of period 2, with a single dose of COC coadministered on day 8. Blood samples were collected to determine LNG and EE PK, and safety was assessed.The AUC geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) for COC + letermovir/COC alone were 1.36 (1.30, 1.43) for LNG and 1.42 (1.32, 1.52) for EE, indicating that letermovir coadministration increased COC exposure. Coadministration had no clinically-meaningful effect on C, t, or apparent terminal T for either LNG or EE. All treatments were generally well tolerated.Letermovir coadministration with COC resulted in an increase in LNG and EE exposure in healthy adult women; however, levels were within the established safety margins. There was no decrease in LNG or EE exposure with no apparent risk of contraceptive failure on coadministration of letermovir and COC. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25740268>Effect of pradigastat, a diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of a combination oral contraceptive in healthy female subjects.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between pradigastat, a potent and selective diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor, and Levora-28®, a combination oral contraceptive (COC) containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol (EE) and 150 μg  (LVG).An open-label, single-sequence three-period (period 1, single dose of COC; period 2, pradigastat 100 mg x 3 days followed by 40 mg x 7 days; and period 3, both pradigastat 40 mg and a single dose of COC) study involving 24 healthy female subjects of childbearing potential was conducted.The pharmacokinetic parameters of EE were similar when administered alone or in combination with pradigastat, as the 90% confidence interval (CI) of geometric mean ratios for EE exposure (AUC and C(max)) were all within the range of 0.80 - 1.25. The AUC(∞), AUC(last), and C(max) of LVG were slightly increased in the presence of pradigastat, the geometric mean ratios (90% CI) were 1.25 (1.16, 1.35), 1.24 (1.15, 1.34), and 1.16 (1.06, 1.27), respectively.Pradigastat did not elicit clinically relevant changes in the magnitude of Levora-28® exposure. Therefore, dose adjustment is not required for Levora-28® when co-administered with pradigastat.</p></html>
