However, the elderly are at significant risk of infectious diseases because they have never been immunized, because they have not been completely immunized, or because their  has waned.  against infectious diseases in the elderly is an important means of controlling diseases in the community. Our objective was to evaluate the seroprotective rate against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis in the elderly Thai population.In total, 430 healthy individuals from the northeastern region of Thailand were enrolled in this study and stratified into five age groups: 60-65, 66-70, 71-75, 76-80, and > 80 years. Serum samples were collected and quantitatively analyzed for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis IgG antibody by using commercial ELISA kits. For anti-diphtheria toxoid and anti-tetanus toxoid ELISA, values < 0.01 IU/ml were interpreted as seronegative, and for anti-Bordetella pertussis toxin ELISA, values < 5 IU/ml were interpreted as seronegative; these definitions were in accord with previous studies.For diphtheria toxoid Ab, the majority of the population had antibody levels > 0.01 IU/ml. For tetanus anti-toxoid Ab, the majority of the population had antibody levels of > 0.01 IU/ml, of which approximately 34% had durable antibody protection levels (DAPL) of ≥ 1 IU/ml. Meanwhile, nearly 45% of the population had an Ab level against pertussis lower than the protectivity level.In total, 97.%, 83.5%, and 55.8% of the population had a higher antibody level than the minimal protective level for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, respectively. In order to prevent an outbreak of these diseases in the future, the elderly should be administered with Tdap revaccination to provide diphtheria herd  in the population; this will increase cocoon phenomenon for pertussis and protect the population from tetanus-prone injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673484>Role of Complement Activation in Allograft Inflammation.</a></h1><p>Novel paradigms have broadened our understanding of mechanisms through which complement mediates allograft inflammation/injury. Herein we review advances in the field and highlight therapeutic implications.Pre-clinical and translational human trials have elucidated complement-dependent mechanisms of post-transplant ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Immune cell-derived, and intracellular, complement activation are newly linked to proinflammatory T cell  relevant to allograft rejection. Complement-induced immune regulation, including C5a ligation of C5a receptor  on T cells, C5a/C5a receptor 1 interactions on regulatory myeloid cells, and C1q binding to CD8 T cells can inhibit proinflammatory T cells and/or prolong murine allograft survival. Pilot trials of complement inhibition to treat/prevent human I/R- or antibody-initiated allograft injury show promise.The complement system participates in allograft injury through multiple context- dependent mechanisms involving various components and receptors. These new insights along with development and implementation of individualized complement inhibitory strategies have potential to improve transplant outcomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661527>Factors associated with pneumococcal carriage and density in infants and young children in Laos PDR.</a></h1><p>Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a precursor to pneumococcal disease. Several host and environmental factors have been associated with pneumococcal carriage, however few studies have examined the relationship between host factors and pneumococcal carriage density. We sought to identify risk factors for pneumococcal carriage and density using data from cross-sectional pneumococcal carriage surveys conducted in the Lao People's Democratic Republic before and after the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected infants from aged 5-8 weeks old (n = 999) and children aged 12-23 months (n = 1,010), pneumococci detected by quantitative PCR, and a risk factor questionnaire completed. Logistic and linear regression models were used to evaluate associations between participant characteristics and pneumococcal carriage and density. In infants aged 5-8 weeks, living in a household with two or more children under the age of five years (aOR 1.97; 95% CI 1.39-.79) and low family income (aOR 1.64; 95% CI 0.99-.72) were positively associated with pneumococcal carriage. For children aged 12-23 months, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms (aOR .64; 95% CI 1.97-3.53), two or more children under five in the household (aOR .40; 95% CI 1.80-3.20), and rural residence (aOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.35-.50) were positively associated with pneumococcal carriage. PCV13 vaccination was negatively associated with carriage of PCV13 serotypes (aOR 0.60; 95% CI 0.44-0.83). URTI symptoms (p < 0.001), current breastfeeding (p = 0.005), rural residence (p = 0.012), and delivery by Caesarean section (p = 0.035) were associated with higher mean pneumococcal density in pneumococcal carriers (both age groups combined). This study provides new data on pneumococcal carriage and density in a high disease burden setting in southeast Asia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676701>Acute Calcium Pyrophosphate Crystal Arthritis Flare Rate and Risk Factors for Recurrence.</a></h1><p>Little is known about acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis flare rates and risk factors for recurrence. We characterized flares and determined the rate and predictors of acute CPP crystal arthritis flares in an academic medical center cohort.We performed a retrospective cohort study among a random sample of patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis identified in the Partners HealthCare electronic medical record, 1991- 2017. Flare was defined as self-limited, acute-onset synovitis with synovial fluid calcium pyrophosphate crystals and/or chondrocalcinosis, not better explained by another cause. We calculated incidence rates (IR) for acute CPP crystal arthritis flare among all subjects and by sex. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) for recurrent flare using univariate Cox models that accounted for within-person correlated data.We identified 70 patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis with a total of 111 flares. Recurrent flares occurred in 24% of patients; half of flares occurred in a previously unaffected joint. The acute CPP crystal arthritis flare rate was 11.4 (95% CI 8.-15.4) per 100 person-years overall, 14. (95% CI 9.6-20.1) in women, and 7.1 (95% CI 3.4-13.0) in men. Cancer (HR .98, 95% CI 1.33-6.68) and chronic kidney disease (HR .92, 95% CI 1.10-7.76) were associated with a higher rate for recurrent flare.Recurrent flares occurred in approximately one-fourth of patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis and often occurred in previously unaffected joints. Acute CPP crystal arthritis flare rate was twice as high in women than men.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658371>Macronutrients modulate survival to infection and  in Drosophila.</a></h1><p>1.  and nutrition are two essential modulators of individual fitness. However, while the implications of immune function and nutrition on an individual's lifespan and reproduction are well established, the interplay between feeding behaviour, infection, and immune function, remains poorly understood. Asking how ecological and physiological factors affect immune responses and resistance to infections is a central theme of eco-immunology. . In this study, we used the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate how infection through septic injury modulates nutritional intake, and how macronutrient balance affects survival to infection by the pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus. 3. Our results show that infected flies maintain carbohydrate intake, but reduce protein intake, thereby shifting from a protein-to-carbohydrate (P:C) ratio of ~1:4 to ~1:10 relative to non-infected and sham-infected flies. Strikingly, the proportion of flies dying after M. luteus infection was significantly lower when flies were fed a low-P high-C diet, revealing that flies shift their macronutrient intake as means of nutritional self-medication against bacterial infection. 4. These results are likely due to the effects of the macronutrient balance on the regulation of the constitutive expression of innate immune genes, as a low-P high-C diet was linked to an up-regulation in the expression of key antimicrobial peptides. 5. Together, our results reveal the intricate relationship between macronutrient intake and resistance to infection, and integrate the molecular cross-talk between metabolic and immune pathways into the framework of nutritional immunology.© 2019 The Authors.

The Tandem Zinc Finger Protein 9 (TZF9) is an RNA-binding protein that is phosphorylated by two PAMP-responsive MAPKs, MPK3 and MPK6. We mapped the major phosphosites in TZF9 and showed their importance for controlling in vitro RNA-binding activity, in vivo flg22-induced rapid disappearance of TZF9-labelled processing body-like structures and TZF9 protein turnover. Microarray analysis showed a strong discordance between transcriptome (total mRNA) and translatome (polysome-associated mRNA) in the tzf9 mutant, with more mRNAs associated to ribosomes in the absence of TZF9. This suggests that TZF9 may sequester and inhibit translation of subsets of mRNAs. Fittingly, TZF9 physically interacts with poly(A)-binding protein  (PAB2), a hallmark constituent of stress granules - a site for stress-induced translational stalling/arrest. TZF9 even promotes stress granule assembly in the absence of stress. Hence, MAPKs may control defence gene expression post-transcriptionally through release from translation arrest within TZF9-PAB2-containing RNA granules or perturbing PAB2 functions in translation control (e.g. in the mRNA closed-loop model of translation).© 2019 The Authors.

Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been identified which are associated with CRP levels, and Mendelian randomization studies have shown a positive association between SNPs increasing CRP expression and risk of colon cancer (but thus far not CVD). The effects of individual genetic variants often interact with the genetic background of a population and hence we sought to resolve the genetic determinants of serum CRP in a number of American Indian populations.The Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) has serum CRP measurements from 2428 tribal members, recruited as large families from three regions of the United States. Microsatellite markers and MetaboChip defined SNP genotypes were incorporated into variance components, decomposition-based linkage and association analyses.CRP levels exhibited significant heritability (h2 = 0.33 ± 0.05, p<1.3 X 10-20). A locus on chromosome (chr) 6, near marker D6S281 (approximately at 169.6 Mb, GRCh38/hg38) showed suggestive linkage (LOD = 1.9) to CRP levels. No individual SNPs were found associated with CRP levels after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing (threshold <7.77 x 10-7), however, we found nominal associations, many of which replicate previous findings at the CRP, HNF1A and 7 other loci. In addition, we report association of 46 SNPs located at 7 novel loci on chromosomes , 5, 6( loci), 9, 10 and 17, with an average of 15.3 Kb between SNPs and all with p-values less than 7. X 10-4.In agreement with evidence from other populations, these data show CRP serum levels are under considerable genetic influence; and include loci, such as near CRP and other genes, that replicate results from other ethnic groups. These findings also suggest possible novel loci on chr 6 and other chromosomes that warrant further investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668931>Japanese flounder pol-miR-3p- suppresses Edwardsiella tarda infection by regulation of autophagy via p53.</a></h1><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators that play vital roles in diverse physiological processes including . In this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanism and function of a novel Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) miRNA, pol-miR-3p-. pol-miR-3p- was responsive in expression to the infection of the bacterial pathogen Edwardsiella tarda. pol-miR-3p- negatively regulated the expression of p53 through interaction with the 3'UTR of p53. Overexpression of pol-miR-3p- promoted autophagy, resulting in augmented production of LC3-II, while knockdown of p53 increased the level of beclin, a key factor of autophagy. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that E. tarda infection induced autophagy in flounder, and pol-miR-3p- inhibited the infectivity of E. tarda. Together these results indicate that pol-miR-3p- regulates autophagy through the target gene p53, thus revealing a regulatory link between p53 and autophagy in teleost, and that pol-miR-3p- plays an important role in the immune defense against E. tarda.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased cellular autophagy may kill the infected cell and terminate the infection without proper regulation. The mechanism of autophagy regulation during liver disease progression in HCV infection is unclear. The autophagy research has gained a lot of attention recently since autophagy impairment is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) are three autophagy processes involved in the lysosomal degradation and extracellular release of cytosolic cargoes under excessive stress. Autophagy processes compensate for each other during extreme endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to promote host and microbe survival as well as HCC development in the highly stressed microenvironment of the cirrhotic liver. This review describes the molecular details of how excessive cellular stress generated during HCV infection activates CMA to improve cell survival. The pathological implications of stress-related CMA activation resulting in the loss of hepatic innate  and tumor suppressors, which are most often observed among cirrhotic patients with HCC, are discussed. The oncogenic cell programming through autophagy regulation initiated by a cytoplasmic virus may facilitate our understanding of HCC mechanisms related to non-viral etiologies and metabolic conditions such as uncontrolled type II diabetes. We propose that a better understanding of how excessive cellular stress leads to cancer through autophagy modulation may allow therapeutic development and early detection of HCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654206>Aberrant methylation of host macrophages induced by tuberculosis infection.</a></h1><p>DNA methylation has been introduced as a promising biomarker for different diseases. Alterations in macrophage DNA methylation status have been documented during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. We conducted this study using a human methylation PCR array kit, which comprised a panel of 22 genes in TLR2 signaling pathway, in order to gain insights into epigenetic interactions between drug-susceptible and -resistant Mtb strains and THP-1-derived macrophages (one of the main host  cells during TB infection). We also evaluated the expression of Rv1988 gene in the studied isolates. It was found that the methylation level of all of the studied inflammatory genes, except Irak- and Tbk-1, increased in THP-1 macrophages, which were infected by extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mtb strains, compared with the mock cells (P < 0.05). In susceptible strains, we only found hypomethylation in Irak- gene, in addition to a slight increase in the methylation levels of Ubev, Ube2n, and Traf6 genes. The present findings provide new insights into the potential role of resistant and susceptible Mtb strains in promoting aberrant epigenetic modifications in macrophages. Further investigations on the host epigenomes, infected with different Mtb isolates, are needed to elucidate their functions in immunological responses and to introduce new effective tools against Mtb infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619500>Toxoplasma gondii Intravacuolar-Network-Associated Dense Granule Proteins Regulate Maturation of the Cyst Matrix and Cyst Wall.</a></h1><p>Little is known regarding how the chronic  cyst develops. Here, we investigated intravacuolar-network-associated dense granule (GRA) proteins GRA1, GRA2, GRA4, GRA6, GRA9, and GRA12 during cyst development  after differentiation of the tachyzoite-stage parasitophorous vacuole. By day 1 postdifferentiation, GRA1, GRA4, GRA6, GRA9, and GRA12 colocalized with  agglutinin stain at the cyst periphery. In contrast, GRA2 remained in the cyst matrix. By day  postdifferentiation, coinciding with localization of GRA2 to the cyst periphery, GRA1, GRA4, GRA6, and GRA9 established a continuous matrix pattern in the cyst. In contrast, GRA2 and GRA12 were colocalized in prominent cyst matrix puncta throughout cyst development. While GRA2, GRA6, and GRA12 localized in outer and inner layers of the cyst wall, GRA1, GRA4, and GRA9 localized predominantly in the inner layers of the cyst wall. GRA2 and GRA12 were colocalized in the cyst wall by day 7 postdifferentiation. However, by day 10 postdifferentiation, GRA12 was relocalized from the cyst wall to puncta in the cyst matrix. Differentiation of Δ parasites revealed a defect in the ability to establish a normal cyst matrix. In addition, the deletion of any intravacuolar-network-associated GRA protein, except GRA1, reduced the rate of accumulation of cyst wall proteins at the cyst periphery relative to the cyst interior. Our findings reveal dynamic patterns of GRA protein localization during cyst development and suggest that intravacuolar-network-associated GRA proteins regulate the formation and maturation of the cyst matrix and cyst wall structures.  establishes chronic infection in humans by forming thick-walled cysts that persist in the brain. If host  wanes, cysts reactivate to cause severe, and often lethal, toxoplasmic encephalitis. There is no available therapy to eliminate cysts or to prevent their reactivation. Moreover, how the vital and characteristic cyst matrix and cyst wall structures develop is poorly understood. Here, we visualized and tracked the localization of  intravacuolar-network-associated dense granule (GRA) proteins during cyst development  Intravacuolar-network GRAs were present within the cyst matrix and at the cyst wall in developing cysts, and genetic deletion of intravacuolar-network-associated GRAs reduced the rate of accumulation of cyst wall material at the cyst periphery. Our results show that intravacuolar-network-associated GRAs, particularly GRA2 and GRA12, play dynamic and essential roles in the development and maturation of the cyst matrix and the cyst wall structures.Copyright © 2019 Guevara et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631717>Atopic dermatitis epidemiology and unmet need in the United Kingdom.</a></h1><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition associated with a significant health-related and socioeconomic burden, and is characterized by intense itch, disruption of the skin barrier, and upregulation of type -mediated immune responses. The United Kingdom (UK) has a high prevalence of AD, affecting 11-20% of children and 5-10% of adults. Approximately % of all cases of childhood AD in the UK are severe. Despite this, most AD treatments are performed at home, with little contact with healthcare providers or services. Here, we discuss the course of AD, treatment practices, and unmet need in the UK. Although the underlying etiology of the disease is still emerging, AD is currently attributed to skin barrier dysfunction and altered inflammatory responses. Management of AD focuses on avoiding triggers, improving skin hydration, managing exacerbating factors, and reducing inflammation through topical and systemic immunosuppressants. However, there is a significant unmet need to improve the overall management of AD and help patients gain control of their disease through safe and effective treatments. Approaches that target individual inflammatory pathways (e.g. dupilumab, anti-interleukin (IL)-4 receptor α) are emerging and likely to provide further therapeutic opportunities for patient benefit.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678303>Disruption of SIRT7 Increases the Efficacy of Checkpoint Inhibitor via MEF2D Regulation of PD-L1 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.</a></h1><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors have some efficacy in treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), expressed on some cancer cells, binds to the receptor programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1, also called PD1) on T cells to prevent their proliferation and reduce the antigen-tumor immune response. Immune cells that infiltrate some types of HCCs secrete interferon gamma (IFNG). Some HCC cells express myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), which has been associated with shorter survival times of patients. We studied whether HCC cell expression of MEF2D regulates expression of PD-L1 in response to IFNG.We analyzed immune cells from 20 fresh HCC tissues by flow cytometry. We analyzed 225 fixed HCC tissues (from  cohorts) from patients in China by immunohistochemistry and obtained survival data. We created mice with liver-specific knockout of MEF2D (MEF2D mice). We knocked out or knocked down MEF2D, E1A binding protein p300 (p300), or sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) in SMMC-7721, Huh7, H22, and Hepa1-6 HCC cell lines, some incubated with IFNG. We analyzed liver tissues form mice and cell lines by RNA sequence, immunoblot, dual luciferase reporter, and chromatin precipitation assays. MEF2D protein acetylation and proteins that interact with MEF2D were identified by co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays. H22 cells, with MEF2D knockout or without (controls) were transplanted into BALB/c mice, some mice were given antibodies to deplete T cells. Mice bearing orthotopic tumors grown from HCC cells with or without knockout of SIRT7, were given injections of an antibody against PD1. Growth of tumors was measured and tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.In human HCC specimens, we found an inverse correlation between level of MEF2D and numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells; level of MEF2D correlated with percentages of PD1-positive or TIM3-positive CD8 T cells. Knockout of MEF2D from H22 cells reduced their growth as allograft tumors in immune-competent mice, but not in immune-deficient mice or mice with depletion of CD8 T cells. When MEF2D-knockout cells were injected into immune-competent mice, they formed smaller tumors that had increased infiltration and activation of T cells, compared with control HCC cells. In human and mouse HCC cells, MEF2D knockdown or knockout reduced expression of PD-L1. MEF2D bound the promoter region of the CD274 gene (encodes PD-L1) and activated its transcription. Overexpression of p300 in HCC cells, or knockout of SIRT7, promoted acetylation of MEF2D and increased its binding, along with acetylated histones, to the promoter region of the CD274. Exposure of HCC cells to IFNG induced expression of p300 and its binding MEF2D, which reduced the interaction between MEF2D and SIRT7. MEF2D-induced expression of PD-L1 upon IFNG exposure was independent of interferon-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) or IRF9. In HCC cells not exposed to IFNG, SIRT7 formed a complex with MEF2D that attenuated expression of PD-L1. Knockout of SIRT7 reduced proliferation of HCC cells and growth of tumors in immune-deficient mice. Compared with allograft tumors grown from control HCC cells, in immune-competent mice, tumors grown from SIRT7-knockout HCC cells expressed higher level of PD-L1 and had reduced infiltration and activation of T cells. In immune-competent mice given antibodies to PD1, allograft tumors grew more slowly from SIRT7-knockout HCC cells than from control HCC cells.Expression MEF2D by HCC cells increases their expression of PD-L1, which prevents CD8 T cell-mediated anti-tumor . When HCC cells are exposed to IFNG, p300 acetylates MEF2D, causing it to bind the CD274 gene promoter and upregulate PD-L1 expression. In addition to promoting HCC cell proliferation, SIRT7 reduced acetylation of MEF2D and expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells not exposed to IFNG. Strategies to manipulate this pathway might increase the efficacy of immune therapies for HCC.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The level of CD8 T-cell activation acts as an immune regulator associated with disease progression. However, little is known about the characteristics of peripheral and tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells in patients with glioma. In this study, we examined the level of CD8 T-cell activation in a group of 143 patients with glioma and determined that peripheral CD3 T cells decreased in accordance with disease severity. The patients' peripheral CD8 T-cell populations were similar to that of healthy donors, and a small amount of CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was identified in glioma tissues. An increase in activated CD8 T cells, characterized as CD38HLA-DR, and their association with disease progression were identified in the patients' peripheral blood and glioma, and shown to display enriched CCR5 and TNFR2 expression levels.  examination of CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cells indicated that this subset of cells displayed stronger secretion of IFN-γ and IL- before and after a 6-h stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (ION) relative to healthy CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cells, indicating the functional feasibility of CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cells. Higher CCL5 protein and mRNA levels were identified in glioma tissues, which was consistent with the immunohistochemistry results revealing both CCL5 and CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cell expression. Patients' CCR5CD38HLA-DRCD8 T cells were further validated and shown to display increases in CD45RACCR7 and T-bet accompanied by substantial CD107-a, IFN-γ, and Granzyme B levels in response to glioma cells.Copyright © 2019 Chen, Wu, Fang, Chen, Feng, Huang, Wei, Fang and Lin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664925>Disparities in access to and use of HIV-related health services in the Netherlands by migrant status and sexual orientation: a cross-sectional study among people recently diagnosed with HIV infection.</a></h1><p>Migrants often face barriers to accessing healthcare. We examined disparities in access to and use of HIV-related health services between migrant and non-migrant people recently diagnosed with HIV living in the Netherlands, taken into account sexual orientation. Also, we examined differences in experiences in living with HIV between these groups.We used a questionnaire and clinical data collected between July 2013 and June 2015 among migrant and non-migrant participants of the European cross-sectional aMASE (Advancing Migrant Access to health Services in Europe) study in the Netherlands. Using univariable logistic regression analyses, we compared outcomes on between migrants and non-migrants, stratified by sexual orientation (with non-migrant men having sex with men [MSM] as the reference group).We included 77 migrant MSM, 115 non-migrant MSM, 21 migrant heterosexual men, 14 non-migrant heterosexual men and 20 migrant women. In univariable analyses, all heterosexual groups were less likely to ever have had an HIV-negative test before their diagnosis and were more likely to be diagnosed late than non-migrant MSM. All migrant groups were more likely to have experienced difficulties accessing general healthcare in the Netherlands and were less likely to have heard of post-exposure prophylaxis than non-migrant MSM. Migrants frequently reported uncertainty about their rights to healthcare and language barriers. Most (93%) participants visited a healthcare facility in the  years before HIV diagnosis but only in 41% an HIV test was discussed during that visit (no statistical difference between groups). Migrant heterosexuals were more likely to have missed appointments at their HIV clinic due to the travel costs than non-migrant MSM. Migrant MSM and women were more likely to have experienced HIV discrimination in the Netherlands than non-migrant MSM.Disparities in access to and use of HIV-related health services and experiences exist by migrant status but also by sexual orientation. Our data suggests heterosexual men and women may particularly benefit from improved access to HIV testing (e.g., through provider-initiated testing), while migrant MSM may benefit from improved access to HIV prevention interventions (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651237>RNA-Seq based transcriptome analysis during bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) infection.</a></h1><p>Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is the member of the genus Pestivirus within the Flaviviridae family and responsible for severe economic losses in the cattle industry. BVDV can employ 'infect-and-persist' strategy and 'hit-and-run' strategy to remain associated with hosts and thus contributes to BVDV circulation in cattle herds. BVDV have also evolved various strategies to evade the innate  of host. To further understand the mechanisms by which BVDV overcomes the host cell innate immune response and provide more clues for further understanding the BVDV-host interaction, in this descriptive study, we conducted a investigation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the host during BVDV infection by RNA-Seq analysis.Our analysis identified 1297, 1732, 3072, and 1877 DEGs in the comparison groups mock vs. MDBK cells infected with BVDV post  h (MBV2h), mock vs. MBV6h, mock vs. MBV12h, and mock vs. MBV24h, respectively. The reproducibility and repeatability of the results were validated by RT-qPCR. Enrichment analyses of GO annotations and KEGG pathways revealed the host DEGs that are potentially induced by BVDV infection and may participate in BVDV-host interactions. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses identified the potential interactions among the DEGs. Our findings suggested that BVDV infection induced the upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The expression of genes that have antiviral roles, including ISG15, Mx1, OSA1Y, were found to be downregulated and are thus potentially associated with the inhibition of host innate immune system during BVDV infection. The expression levels of F3, C1R, KNG1, CLU, C3, FB, SERPINA5, SERPINE1, C1S, F2RL2, and C2, which belong to the complement and coagulation signalling cascades, were downregulated during BVDV infection, which suggested that the complement system might play a crucial role during BVDV infection.In this descriptive study, our findings revealed the changes in the host transcriptome expression profile during BVDV infection and suggested that BVDV-infection induced altering the host's metabolic network, the inhibition of the expression of antiviral proteins and genes within the complement system might be contributed to BVDV proliferation. The above findings provided unique insights for further studies on the mechanisms underlying BVDV-host interactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622420>Extracellular vesicles in human semen modulate antigen-presenting cell function and decrease downstream antiviral T cell responses.</a></h1><p>Human semen contains trillions of extracellular vesicles (SEV) similar in size to sexually transmitted viruses and loaded with potentially bioactive miRNAs, proteins and lipids. SEV were shown to inhibit HIV and Zika virus infectivity, but whether SEV are able also to affect subsequent immune responses is unknown. We found that SEV efficiently bound to and entered antigen-presenting cells (APC) and thus we set out to further dissect the impact of SEV on APC function and the impact on downstream T cell responses. In an APC-T cell co-culture system, SEV exposure to APC alone markedly reduced antigen-specific cytokine production, degranulation and cytotoxicity by antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells. In contrast, inhibition of CD4+ T cell responses required both APC and T cell exposure to SEV. Surprisingly, SEV did not alter MHC or co-stimulatory receptor expression on APCs, but caused APCs to upregulate indoleamine ,3 deoxygenase, an enzyme known to indirectly inhibit T cells. Thus, SEV reduce the ability of APCs to activate T cells. We propose here that these immune-inhibitory properties of SEV may be intended to prevent immune responses against semen-derived antigens, but can be hi-jacked by genitally acquired viral infections to compromise adaptive cellular .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666702> to commensal papillomaviruses protects against skin cancer.</a></h1><p>Immunosuppression increases the risk of cancers that are associated with viral infection. In particular, the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin-which has been associated with beta human papillomavirus (β-HPV) infection-is increased by more than 100-fold in immunosuppressed patients. Previous studies have not established a causative role for HPVs in driving the development of skin cancer. Here we show that T cell  against commensal papillomaviruses suppresses skin cancer in immunocompetent hosts, and the loss of this -rather than the oncogenic effect of HPVs-causes the markedly increased risk of skin cancer in immunosuppressed patients. To investigate the effects of papillomavirus on carcinogen-driven skin cancer, we colonized several strains of immunocompetent mice with mouse papillomavirus type 1 (MmuPV1). Mice with natural  against MmuPV1 after colonization and acquired  through the transfer of T cells from immune mice or by MmuPV1 vaccination were protected against skin carcinogenesis induced by chemicals or by ultraviolet radiation in a manner dependent on CD8 T cells. RNA and DNA in situ hybridization probes for 25 commensal β-HPVs revealed a significant reduction in viral activity and load in human skin cancer compared with the adjacent healthy skin, suggesting a strong immune selection against virus-positive malignant cells. Consistently, E7 peptides from β-HPVs activated CD8 T cells from unaffected human skin. Our findings reveal a beneficial role for commensal viruses and establish a foundation for immune-based approaches that could block the development of skin cancer by boosting  against the commensal HPVs present in all of our skin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666931>T-helper 1-type cytokines induce apoptosis and loss of HER-family oncodriver expression in murine and human breast cancer cells.</a></h1><p>A recent neoadjuvant vaccine trial for early breast cancer induced strong Th1  against the HER- oncodriver, complete pathologic responses in 18% of subjects, and for many individuals, dramatically reduced HER- expression on residual disease. To explain these observations, we investigated actions of Th1 cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) on murine and human breast cancer cell lines that varied in the surface expression of HER-family receptor tyrosine kinases. Breast cancer lines were broadly sensitive to the combination of IFN-γ and TNF-α, as evidenced by lower metabolic activity, lower proliferation, and enhanced apoptosis, and in some cases a reversible inhibition of surface expression of HER proteins. Apoptosis was accompanied by caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, the pharmacologic caspase-3 activator PAC-1 mimicked both the killing effects and HER--suppressive activities of Th1 cytokines, while a caspase 3/7 inhibitor could prevent cytokine-induced HER- loss. These studies demonstrate that many  effects of vaccination (apparent tumor cell death and loss of HER- expression) could be replicated  using only the principle Th1 cytokines. These results are consistent with the notion that IFN-γ and TNF-α work in concert to mediate many biological effects of therapeutic vaccination through the induction of a caspase 3-associated cellular death mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649497>Peripheral Humoral Immune Response Is Associated With the Non-motor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease.</a></h1><p>Non-motor symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and can even be used as part of the supportive criteria for diagnosis. Chronic inflammation is involved in every stage of PD. Disorders of the immune system affect the peripheral blood. Whether the humoral immune response is associated with the non-motor symptoms of PD remains unknown.Mann-Whitney tests and Bonferroni correction were used to compare the serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C4 between 180 sporadic PD patients and 187 healthy controls. Multiple regression models were conducted to assess the associations among these indicators of humoral  and the clinical features of PD patients.Male PD patients had lower levels of C3 and C4 than healthy controls [0.87 (0.22) vs. 0.96 (0.19); 0.19 (0.06) vs. 0.22 (0.07), respectively, Pc < 0.01] and lower levels of C3 than female PD patients [0.87 (0.22) vs. 1.02 (0.23), Pc < 0.01].

Treatment with synthetic PIP peptides led to similar transcriptome reprogramming, indicating an effect on innate -related processes and phytohormones, including jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signalling. PIP3 overexpressing (OX) plants showed enhanced growth inhibition in response to flg22 exposure. In addition, flg22-induced production of reactive oxygen species and callose deposition were significantly reduced in PIP3-OX plants. Interestingly, PIP3-OX plants showed increased susceptibility both toward Botrytis cinerea and the biotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Expression of both JA and salicylic acid biosynthesis and signalling genes was more induced during B. cinerea infection in PIP3-OX plants compared with wild-type plants. Promoter and ChIP-seq analyses indicated that the transcription factors WRKY18, WRKY33 and WRKY40 cooperatively act as repressors for PIP3.

Currently used diagnostic tools such as the single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT) are time consuming and labor intensive. A rapid, easy-to-use and cost-effective diagnostic test would greatly contribute to the control of bTB in developing countries like Ethiopia. In the present study, two point-of-care diagnostic tests were evaluated for the detection of bTB: LIONEX® Animal TB Rapid test, a membrane-based test for the detection of antibodies to Mycobacterium bovis in blood and ALERE® Determine TB Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) Ag, an immunoassay for the detection of lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen (Ag) of mycobacteria in urine. A combination of the SICTT and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) test was used as the gold standard for the validation of these point-of-care tests, as it was not feasible to slaughter the study animals to carry out the historical gold standard of mycobacterial culture. A total of 175 heads of cattle having three different bTB infection categories (positive SICTT, negative SICTT, and unknown SICTT status) were used for this study.The sensitivity and specificity of TB LAM Ag were 72.% (95% CI = 62., 80.4) and 98.8% (95% CI = 93.6, 99.7), respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity of the LIONEX Animal TB rapid test assay were 54% (95% CI = 44.1 64.3) and 98.8% (95% CI = 93.6, 99.7) respectively. The agreement between TB LAM Ag and SICTT was higher (κ = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.65-0.94) than between TB LAM Ag and IFN-γ (κ = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.52-0.81). The agreement between LIONEX Animals TB Rapid blood test and SICTT was substantial, (κ = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.49-0.77) while the agreement between LIONEX Animal TB rapid blood test and IFN-γ test was moderate (κ = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.40-0.67). Analysis of receiver operating curve (ROC) indicated that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for TB LAM Ag was 0.85 (95% CI = 0.79-0.91) while it was 0.76 (95% CI; =0.69-0.83) for LIONEX Animal TB rapid test assay.This study showed that TB LAM Ag had a better diagnostic performance and could potentially be used as ancillary either to SICTT or IFN-γ test for diagnosis of bTB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629808>Prognostic role of circulating neutrophil extracellular traps levels for long-term mortality in new end-stage renal disease patients.</a></h1><p>Dysregulation of innate  has been proposed as an important contributing factor for advanced atherosclerosis and resultant high mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. To evaluate the long-term prognostic role of in vivo neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), we measured circulating serum nucleosome, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and DNase I levels in 281 incident HD patients. Circulating nucleosome level was significantly higher in HD patients compared to controls, and it was closely associated with MPO levels, suggesting increased in vivo NETs in uremia. Patients in the nucleosome Q4 group had significantly increased all-cause and adverse CV mortality compared to those in the Q1-3 group even after adjusting traditional risk factors Also, serum DNase I level was significantly higher in HD patients than controls (.76 ± 1.02 ng/ml and 1.93 ± 0.85 ng/ml), but it had no correlation with NETs. Interestingly, it serves an additive biomarker for predicting poor CV outcomes.

Therefore, monitoring CD38 expression has gained great attention for tracking the progression of tumors and cancer treatment. Herein, we aim to develop a PET tracer using an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (daratumumab) to monitor CD38 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, daratumumab was radiolabeled with Cu (t=12.7 h) to obtain Cu-NOTA-daratumumab. Relative CD38 expression in HepG2 and Huh7 HCC cell lines was assessed using western blot. The specificity of Cu-NOTA-daratumumab to both cell lines was examined using an in vitro cell-binding assay. PET imaging in subcutaneous models of HCC was performed to evaluate the capability and specificity of Cu-NOTA-daratumumab to target CD38 in vivo. Region-of-interest analysis and ex vivo biodistribution were performed to verify the tracer targeting capability of CD38. Through cellular studies of two HCC cell lines, CD38 expression was found to be higher in HepG2 and minimal in Huh7 cells. Cu-NOTA-daratumumab showed relatively high affinity to CD38 (K=18.21 ± 1.74 nM), while the affinity of Huh7 was in the micromolar range for daratumumab binding to the cells (K=3.98 ± 0.87 μM). At 48 h post-injection, PET imaging of subcutaneous models with Cu-NOTA-daratumumab revealed tumor uptakes of 12.23 ± .4 and .7 ± 1. %ID/g for HepG2 and Huh7, respectively (n=4), which correlated well with relative CD38 expression of the cells. Moreover, the Cu-NOTA-IgG nonspecific analogue showed a significantly lower uptake in HepG2 subcutaneous model in mice, suggesting a specific binding of daratumumab with CD38 in vivo. Our cellular studies and PET imaging confirmed the capability and specificity of Cu-NOTA-daratumumab for the imaging of CD38 in murine models of HCC. This study supports our claim that Cu-NOTA-daratumumab is an effective PET tracer for the non-invasive evaluation of CD38 expression and sensitive detection of CD38-positive tumor lesions in HCC.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628929>IL-17A-producing innate lymphoid cells promote skin inflammation by inducing IL-33- driven type  immune responses.</a></h1><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, pruritic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by a type  cytokines secreted by T helper  (Th2) cells and group  innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). Despite a high degree of heterogeneity, AD is still explained by type  , and the role of interleukin (IL)-17A, which is increased in acute, pediatric, or Asian patients with AD, remains poorly understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of IL-17A-producing ILC3s, which are unexplored immune cells, in the pathogenesis of AD. We found that the numbers of ILC3s in the skin of AD-induced mice were increased, and that neutralizing IL-17A delayed development of AD. Moreover, adoptive transfer of ILC3s accelerated the symptoms of AD. Mechanically, ILC3s induced IL-33 production by non-immune skin cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts, which promoted type  immune responses. Because AD has a complex pathophysiology and a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes, the presence of ILC3s in the skin and their interaction with non-immune skin cells could explain the pathogenesis of cutaneous AD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Functional TCR subunit genes are formed by somatic rearrangement, and some of the resulting TCRs recognize autoantigens, the body's own molecules. The autoreactive T cells that carry such TCRs pose a threat of inducing immune reactions against their own organism. In the course of the immune system's development, some autoreactive T lymphocytes are eliminated by apoptosis, some differentiate into immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which support immunological tolerance to autoantigens, and the rest fall into a non-functional state of anergy. Suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells is mediated by immunosuppressive cytokines and costimulatory molecules, depletion of stimulating IL-, removal of autoreactive peptides together with MHC molecules, and in other ways. Impairment of self-tolerance leads to autoimmune diseases. However, the loss of immunological tolerance can be employed in tumor treatment, allowing immunotherapy and the use of the potential of autoreactive effector T cells. The fact that the efficacious immunotherapy of tumors is often accompanied by adverse autoimmune reactions currently seems to be the inevitable price paid by using this approach.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657119>CD154-expressing CMV-specific T cells associate with freedom from DNAemia and may be protective in seronegative recipients after liver or intestine transplantation.</a></h1><p>Cell-mediated  to CMV, if known, could improve antiviral drug therapy in at-risk children and young adults with LT and IT. Host  has been measured with CMV-specific T cells, which express IFNγ, but not those which express CD154, a possible substitute for IFNγ. CMV-specific CD154+ T cells and their subsets were measured with flow cytometry after stimulating PBL from recipient blood samples with an overlapping peptide mix of CMV-pp65 antigen for up to 6 hours. CMV-specific CD154+ T cells co-expressed IFNγ in PBL from three healthy adults and averaged 3.8% (95% CI 3.%-4.4%) in 40 healthy adults. CMV-specific T cells were significantly lower in 19 CMV DNAemic LT or IT recipients, compared with 126 non-DNAemic recipients, 1.3% (95% CI 0.8-1.7) vs 4.1 (95% CI 3.6-4.6, P < .001). All T-cell subsets demonstrated similar between-group differences. In logistic regression analysis of 46 training set samples, 12 with DNAemia, all obtained between days 0 and 60 from transplant, CMV-specific T-cell frequencies ≥1.7% predicted freedom from DNAemia with NPV of 93%. Sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 83%, 74%, and 53%, respectively. Test performance was replicated in 99 validation samples. In 32 of 46 training set samples, all from seronegative recipients, one of 19 recipients with CMV-specific T-cell frequencies ≥1.7% experienced DNAemia, compared with 8 of 13 recipients with frequencies <1.7% (P = .001). CMV-specific CD154+ T cells are associated with freedom from DNAemia after LT and IT.

This article explores the extent to which temporal changes in PVS explain the observed lack of association between universal treatment and cumulative HIV incidence seen in the ANRS 12249 TasP trial conducted in rural South Africa.The TasP cluster-randomized trial (2012 to 2016) implemented six-monthly repeat home-based HIV counselling and testing (RHBCT) and referral of PLHIV to local HIV clinics in  × 11 clusters opened sequentially. ART was initiated according to national guidelines in control clusters and regardless of CD4 count in intervention clusters. We measured residency status, HIV status, and HIV care status for each participant on a daily basis. PVS was computed per cluster among all resident PLHIV (≥16, including those not in care) at cluster opening and daily thereafter. We used a mixed linear model to explore time patterns in PVS, adjusting for sociodemographic changes at the cluster level.8563 PLHIV were followed. During the course of the trial, PVS increased significantly in both arms (23.5% to 46.% in intervention, +22.8, p < 0.001; 26.0% to 44.6% in control, +18.6, p < 0.001). That increase was similar in both arms (p = 0.514). In the final adjusted model, PVS increase was most associated with increased RHBCT and the implementation of local trial clinics (measured by time since cluster opening). Contextual changes (measured by calendar time) also contributed slightly. The effect of universal ART (trial arm) was positive but limited.PVS was improved significantly but similarly in both trial arms, explaining partly the null effect observed in terms of cumulative HIV incidence between arms. The PVS gains due to changes in ART-initiation guidelines alone are relatively small compared to gains obtained by strategies to maximize testing and linkage to care. The achievement of the 90-90-90 targets will not be met if the operational and implementational challenges limiting access to care and treatment, often context-specific, are not properly addressed.

The immunomodulatory potential of  branch water extract (DBW) was evaluated by determining its effect on cell viability and the expression of cytokines and immune effector molecules in mouse RAW264.7 macrophages and splenocytes. Production of nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-, and IFN-) in RAW264.7 macrophages increased after treatment with DBW. The activation of components of the NF-B signaling pathway, including the phospho-IB and the expression and translocation of p65, a subunit of NF-B, were also increased in RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cells after treatment with DBW. In addition, when mice were orally administered DBW, splenocyte cytokines and NO production were increased in a dose-dependent manner relative to control-treated mice. Furthermore, natural killer cell activity in DBW-treated mice was determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. LDH release also increased in response to DBW treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that  extract enhances innate  by promoting NF-B signaling, leading to increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and effector molecules. DBW therefore has potential therapeutic use in the context of immune stimulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654766>Characterization, subcellular localization and function analysis of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (Pt-MyD88) in swimming crab, Portunus trituberculatus.</a></h1><p>Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a universal and essential adaptor protein required for the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) pathway activation in invertebrates as well as in vertebrates. Herein, we characterized a MyD88 (Pt-MyD88) cDNA sequence in the swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus). The Pt-MyD88 ORF is predicted to encode 469 peptides with an N-terminal death domain and a typical C-terminal TIR domain. Real-Time quantitative PCR analysis showed that the Pt-MyD88 transcriptions were constitutively expressed in hemocytes, gill, intestine, heart and muscle in normal crab. The expressions of Pt-MyD88 would be down-regulated by V. alginolyticus or LPS challenge, and be up-regulated by WSSV infection in hemocytes. Intracellular localization showed Pt-MyD88 was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm when it was over-expressed in human cell HEK293T or in Drosophila Schneider  (S2). Functionally, over-expression of Pt-MyD88 could either activate the NF-κB in HEK293T cells or activate the promoters of Drosophila antimicrobial peptide genes (AMPs) in S2 cell. In primary cultured hemocytes of swimming crab, after Pt-MyD88 was knocked-down by specific long double strand RNA, the expression of anti-lipopolysaccharide factor1 (ALF1), hyastatin3, crustin1 and crustin3 have been significantly inhibited, while the expression of other AMPs is normal compared to non-specific dsRNA treated cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Effective therapy and vaccination are needed to control viral expansion. However, current anti-IAV drugs risk inducing drug-resistant virus emergence. Although intranasal administration of whole inactivated virus vaccine can induce efficient protective , formalin and β-propiolactone are the currently used and harmful inactivating agents. Here, we analyzed the antiviral activity of hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) tea extract against human IAV and evaluated its potential as a novel anti-IAV drug and a safe inactivating agent for whole inactivated vaccine. The in vitro study revealed that the pH of hibiscus tea extract is acidic, and its rapid and potent antiviral activity relied largely on the acidic pH. Furthermore, the mouse study showed that the acidic extract was not effective for either therapeutic or vaccination purposes. However, hibiscus tea extract and protocatechuic acid, one of the major components of the extract, showed not only potent acid-dependent antiviral activity but also weak low-pH-independent activity. The low-pH-independent activity did not affect the conformation of immunodominant hemagglutinin protein. Although this low-pH-independent activity is very limited, it may be suitable for the application to medication and vaccination because this activity is not affected by the neutral blood environment and does not lose antigenicity of hemagglutinin. Further study of the low-pH-independent antiviral mechanism and attempts to enhance the antiviral activity may establish a novel anti-IAV therapy and vaccination strategy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666701>The clinical KRAS(G12C) inhibitor AMG 510 drives anti-tumour .</a></h1><p>KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in cancer and encodes a key signalling protein in tumours.

In preclinical analyses, treatment with AMG 510 led to the regression of KRAS tumours and improved the anti-tumour efficacy of chemotherapy and targeted agents. In immune-competent mice, treatment with AMG 510 resulted in a pro-inflammatory tumour microenvironment and produced durable cures alone as well as in combination with immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Cured mice rejected the growth of isogenic KRAS tumours, which suggests adaptive  against shared antigens.

The main transmission route is from toddlers, who commonly carry pneumococci. However, neonatal pneumococcal disease case reports suggest that vertical pneumococcal transmission may also occur.To describe and compare pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage and density by infant mode of delivery in young Fijian infants.Annual cross-sectional surveys were performed in Suva, Fiji, before the introduction of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10), from September 14 to December 20, 2012, and after PCV10 was introduced, from July 11 to November 19, 2013; July 15 to December 9, 2014; and August 13 to November 19, 2015.

Vaginal delivery was not associated with PCV10 carriage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.67 [95% CI, 0.80-3.51]; P = .17). After adjustment, vaginal delivery was not associated with density.Pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence and density were higher in infants delivered vaginally compared with those delivered by cesarean birth. After adjustment, vaginal delivery was associated with pneumococcal carriage. Differences in carriage by mode of delivery may be due to differential exposure to the vaginal microbiota during delivery and the effect of intrapartum antibiotics during cesarean delivery on the infant microbiome. Our findings also raise the hypothesis that vertical transmission may contribute to pneumococcal acquisition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663692>Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4 and hepatocellular carcinoma: A retrospective case-control study.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have shown that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 4 (ADAMTS4) may involve in the pathogenesis of some diseases. However, it is not clear whether they are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A hospital-based case-control study, including 862 cases with HCC and 1120 controls, was conducted to assess the effects of 258 SNPs in the coding regions of ADAMTS4 on HCC risk and prognosis. We found that six SNPs in ADAMTS4 were differential distribution between cases and controls via the primary screening analyses; however, only rs538321148 and rs1014509103 polymorphisms were further identified to modify the risk of HCC (odds ratio: .73 and .95; 95% confidence interval, .28-3.29 and .43-3.58; P-value, 5.73 × 10 and 1.36 × 10 , respectively). Significant interaction between these two SNPs and two known causes of hepatitis B virus and aflatoxin B1 were also observed. Furthermore, rs538321148 and rs1014509103 polymorphisms were associated not only with clinicopathological features of tumor such as tumor stage and grade, microvessel density, and vessel metastasis, but with poor overall survival. Additionally, these SNPs significantly downregulated ADATMS4 expression in tumor tissues. These data suggest that SNPs in the coding region of ADAMTS4, such as rs538321148 and rs1014509103, may be potential biomarkers for predicting HCC risk and prognosis.© 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, a better stratification of patients and the development of novel therapeutic protocols are crucially needed. The importance of tumor-infiltrating B cells (TIL-Bs) in shaping antitumor  remains unclear; therefore, we analyzed frequency, phenotype, prognostic value and possible roles of TIL-Bs in OPSCC.We utilized transcriptomic analysis of immune response-related genes in 18 OPSCC samples with respect to human papillomavirus (HPV) status. The density and localization of CD20, CD8 and DC-LAMP cells were subsequently analyzed in 72 tissue sections of primary OPSCC samples in relation to patients' prognosis. The immunohistochemical approach was supplemented by flow cytometry-based analysis of phenotype and functionality of TIL-Bs in freshly resected primary OPSCC tissues.We observed significantly higher expression of B cell-related genes and higher densities of CD20 B cells in HPV-associated OPSCC samples. Interestingly, CD20 TIL-Bs and CD8 T cells formed non-organized aggregates with interacting cells within the tumor tissue. The densities of both intraepithelial CD20 B cells and B cell/CD8 T cell interactions showed prognostic significance, which surpassed HPV positivity and CD8 TIL density in stratification of OPSCC patients. High density of TIL-Bs was associated with an activated B cell phenotype, high CXCL9 production and high levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Importantly, the abundance of direct B cell/CD8 T cell interactions positively correlated with the frequency of HPV16-specific CD8 T cells, whereas the absence of B cells in tumor-derived cell cultures markedly reduced CD8 T cell survival.Our results indicate that high abundance of TIL-Bs and high density of direct B cell/CD8 T cell interactions can predict patients with excellent prognosis, who would benefit from less invasive treatment. We propose that in extensively infiltrated tumors, TIL-Bs might recruit CD8 T cells via CXCL9 and due to a highly activated phenotype contribute by secondary costimulation to the maintenance of CD8 T cells in the tumor microenvironment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634899>FSP1 is a glutathione-independent ferroptosis suppressor.</a></h1><p>Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of necrotic cell death marked by oxidative damage to phospholipids. To date, ferroptosis has been believed to be restrained only by the phospholipid hydroperoxide (PLOOH)-reducing enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and radical-trapping antioxidants (RTAs). The factors which underlie a given cell type's sensitivity to ferroptosis are, however, critical to understand the pathophysiological role of ferroptosis and how it may be exploited for cancer treatment. Although metabolic constraints and phospholipid composition contribute to ferroptosis sensitivity, no cell-autonomous mechanisms have been yet been identified that account for ferroptosis resistance. We undertook an expression cloning approach to identify genes able to complement GPX4 loss. These efforts uncovered the flavoprotein "apoptosis inducing factor mitochondria-associated  (AIFM2)" as a previously unrecognized anti-ferroptotic gene. AIFM2, hereafter renamed "ferroptosis-suppressor-protein 1" (FSP1), initially described as a pro-apoptotic gene, confers an unprecedented protection against ferroptosis elicited by GPX4 deletion. We further demonstrate that ferroptosis suppression by FSP1 is mediated via ubiquinone (CoQ): its reduced form ubiquinol traps lipid peroxyl radicals that mediate lipid peroxidation, while FSP1 catalyses its regeneration by using NAD(P)H. Pharmacological targeting of FSP1 strongly synergizes with GPX4 inhibitors to trigger ferroptosis in a number of cancer entities. In conclusion, FSP1/CoQ/NAD(P)H exists as a stand-alone parallel system, which co-operates with GPX4 and glutathione (GSH) to suppress phospholipid peroxidation (pLPO) and ferroptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646599>Effect of probiotics on the occurrence of nutrition absorption capacities in healthy children: a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled pilot study.</a></h1><p>Recent advances in the translational research showed that dietary nutrients have critical importance to the microbioma balance in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the alteration of the intestinal microbiota in order to achieve, restore, and maintain favorable balance in the ecosystem, and the activity of microorganisms present in the gastrointestinal tract is necessary for the improved health condition of the host. The objective of this translational study was to evaluate, in a pediatric population, the efficacy and safety of prophylactic probiotics for a better nutritional absorption capacity in the view to enhance their overall health and .A total of 40 pediatric patients between the ages of 14 and 18 years were enrolled in the study and divided under two categories (treated/active group and placebo group). Three-time points clinical evaluations were performed: a baseline assessment (Time 0), a second evaluation at 5 weeks after the start of probiotic use (Time 1), and a final evaluation at the timeline after 10 weeks (Time ). In the initial phase of the study, the recruited subjects underwent a panel of initial T0 clinical tests. For each of the patients, a blood sample was taken in order to evaluate the following biochemical measurements: Vitamin D, Vitamin A, Calcium, Zinc, and Iron. Moreover, an initial nutritional evaluation was carried out through which the nutritionist estimated the body composition of the subject (weight and body mass index), the caloric needs and dietary behaviour of each recruited patient.Eligible participants were randomized into placebo (n = 20) or treated/active (n = 20) treatment conditions by random allocation using a computerized random number generator, ensuring all investigators remained blind to the treatment distribution. The data were compared within and between groups using statistical methods. The results confirmed that the probiotic supplementation was effective in increasing the overall blood biomarkers levels of vitamins, calcium, and mineral absorption from baseline to 10 weeks of treatment, compared with the placebo.Probiotics may be suggested as supplements to improve biomarkers serum concentration if administered for a period of at least ≥ 5 weeks. However, further studies are required for optimal recommendations in patient treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642700>Inter-host Transmission of Carbapenemase-Producing  among Humans and Backyard Animals.</a></h1><p>The rapidly increasing dissemination of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in both humans and animals poses a global threat to public health. However, the transmission of CRE between humans and animals has not yet been well studied.We investigated the prevalence, risk factors, and drivers of CRE transmission between humans and their backyard animals in rural China.We conducted a comprehensive sampling strategy in 12 villages in Shandong, China. Using the household [residents and their backyard animals (farm and companion animals)] as a single surveillance unit, we assessed the prevalence of CRE at the household level and examined the factors associated with CRE carriage through a detailed questionnaire. Genetic relationships among human- and animal-derived CRE were assessed using whole-genome sequencing-based molecular methods.A total of 88 New Delhi -type carbapenem-resistant  (NDM-EC), including 17 from humans, 44 from pigs, 12 from chickens, 1 from cattle, and  from dogs, were isolated from 65 of the 746 households examined. The remaining 12 NDM-EC were from flies in the immediate backyard environment. The NDM-EC colonization in households was significantly associated with ) the number of species of backyard animals raised/kept in the same household, and ) the use of human and/or animal feces as fertilizer. Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) revealed that a large proportion of the core genomes of the NDM-EC belonged to strains from hosts other than their own, and several human isolates shared closely related core single-nucleotide polymorphisms and  genetic contexts with isolates from backyard animals.To our knowledge, we are the first to report evidence of direct transmission of NDM-EC between humans and animals. Given the rise of NDM-EC in community and hospital infections, combating NDM-EC transmission in backyard farm systems is needed. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5251.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651032>Antibiotic resistance patterns of Escherichia coli in migrants versus non-migrants: a study of 14,561 urine samples.</a></h1><p>To investigate differences in distribution of urine isolates and antibiotic resistance patterns in Escherichia coli (E. coli), the predominant uropathogen, in migrants and non-migrant individuals.We linked a cohort consisting of all migrants obtaining residence as refugees or family-reunited migrants in Denmark between January 1993 and December 2015 to hospital urine samples examined from January 2000 to December 2015 at the Department of Microbiology, University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark. Samples from non-migrant individuals, Danish-born from Danish parents, were included as comparison. Analysis was carried out using multivariate logistic regression.14,561 first time urine samples were included, with E. coli being the most prevalent bacterial pathogen. Of the identified isolates 4,686/11,737 were E. coli among non-migrants and 1,032/,824 among migrants.Sulfamethoxazol-Trimethoprim resistance was found in 34.3% (350/1020) of E. coli isolates among migrants and 23.% (1070/4619) among non-migrant patients (Odds ratio (OR) 1.73, 95%CI: 1.47-.03). Ciprofloxacin resistance was found in 5.8% (36/618) of isolates among migrants and .% (67/3092) among non-migrants (OR .20, 95%CI:1.37-3.53). Gentamicin resistance was seen in 10.8% (61/565) and 4.7% (110/2328) of isolates (OR .33, 95%CI:1.63-3.34), Cefuroxime resistance in 8.5% (87/1019) and 3.4% (158/4618) (OR .40, 95%CI:1.77-3.24), Ampicillin resistance in 51.4% and 40.8% (OR 1.65, 95%CI: 1.42-1.92), and Piperacillin-Tazobactam resistance in 6.9 % (30/432) and 4.% (65/1532) for migrant and non-migrant patients respectively. When stratifying according to migrant status, family-reunited had higher odds of resistance than refugees for Sulfamethoxazol-Trimethoprim, Gentamicin, and Ampicillin.Prevalence of antibiotic resistance was significantly higher in E. coli isolates among migrants, both refugees and family reunited, than non-migrant patients. Differences could not be explained by comorbidity or income. The results emphasise the importance of urine sample testing in both local-born and migrants before antibiotic start-up and points to the benefit of considering migration to secure individual treatment and equal health outcomes.© International Society of Travel Medicine 2019.

With data from varicella notification and surveys on immunization coverage, we used the screening method to estimate dose-specific varicella vaccine effectiveness (VE) among preschool children in Hong Kong before universal vaccination. We estimated the VE of one- and two-dose varicella vaccination against all notified varicella as 69.4% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 69.5-71.) and 93.4% (95% CI 91.7-94.7), respectively. We found that VE did not decrease with time since receipt. Varicella vaccine was more effective against complications (85.4% [95% CI 48.8-95.8] for one dose and 100% [95% CI -Inf to 100] for two doses) and against hospital admission (75.% [95% CI 53.4-86.8] for one dose and 93.1% [95% CI 47.1-99.1] for two doses). Lower protection of one-dose varicella vaccine resulted in breakthrough varicella. Under universal vaccination, second-dose varicella vaccine (given as combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine) was first scheduled for children when they reach primary one (about 6 years of age) and was recently advanced to 18 months of age. Shortening the interval between the first dose and second dose of varicella vaccination should reduce breakthrough varicella and outbreaks in preschool.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640857>Upregulation of cellulase activity and mRNA levels by bacterial challenge in the earthworm Eisenia andrei, supporting the involvement of cellulases in innate .</a></h1><p>To investigate whether earthworm cellulases contribute to the innate immune system, the responsiveness of cellulase activity and mRNA expression to bacterial challenge was examined by zymography and RNA sequencing. A zymographic analysis revealed that the activity levels of earthworm cellulases were upregulated in response to either a bacterial (Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli) or LPS challenge. After the challenge, significant increases in cellulase 1 and cellulase  activity levels were observed within 8-16 and 16-24 h, respectively. In the coelomic fluid, both activities were significantly upregulated at 8 h post-injection with B. subtilis. Based on RNA sequencing, cellulase-related mRNAs encoding beta-1,4-endoglucanases were upregulated by 3-fold within 6 h after B. subtilis injection. Our results clearly demonstrated that earthworm cellulases are upregulated by bacterial challenge at the mRNA and protein levels. These results support the view that earthworm cellulases act as inducible humoral effectors of innate  against bacterial infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Few studies have reported the preventable effects of immunoregulators, except for antibiotics, against leptospirosis. Generally, immunostimulatory agents are considered effective for enhancing innate immune responses. Many studies have found that beta-glucan (β-glucan) could be a potent and valuable immunostimulant for improving immune responses and controlling diseases. In this study, we investigated the preventable role of β-glucan against Leptospira infection in hamsters. First, β-glucan was administered 24 h prior to, during and after infection. The results showed that β-glucan increased the survival rate to 100%, alleviated tissue injury, and decreased leptospire loads in target organs. Additionally, we found using quantitative real-time PCR that application of β-glucan significantly enhanced the expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) , interleukin (IL)-1β and iNOS at  dpi (days post infection) and reduced the increase of TLR2, IL-1β and iNOS induced by Leptospira at 5 dpi. Furthermore, to induce memory , β-glucan was administered 5 days prior to infection. β-Glucan also significantly increased the survival rates and ameliorated pathological damage to organs. Moreover, we demonstrated that β-glucan-trained macrophages exhibited elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6) in vitro, indicating that β-glucan induces an enhanced inflammatory response against Leptospira infection. These results indicate that administration of β-glucan and other immunostimulants could be potential valuable options for the control of Leptospira infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654229>Evaluation of circulating leukocyte transcriptome and its relationship with immune function and blood markers in dairy cows during the transition period.</a></h1><p>Dairy cows during the transition period are faced with important physiological changes which include a dysfunctional immune system and an increased inflammatory state. New data are necessary to understand the key factors involved in the immune system regulation. Six dairy cows were sampled during transition period to investigate the leukocyte transcriptome changes and its relationship with blood biomarkers. Blood samples were collected at - 20 ± , - 3 ± 1, 3, and 7 days from parturition (DFP). Leukocyte transcriptome was analyzed by deep sequencing technology (Hiseq1000 Illumina, USA). Plasma was analyzed for metabolic biomarkers. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were used to run an enrichment analysis through the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA). Considering - 20 DFP as references time, the main KEGG impacted pathways were activated before calving (- 3 DFP) and were connected to lipid metabolism, lipid transport in plasma, and phagosome. The greatest differences were found after parturition with 281 DEG (179 upregulated and 102 downregulated). The activated pathways were mainly related to  and endocrine aspects, while metabolic pathways related to lipid and amino acid metabolism were inhibited. Plasma BHBA had a substantial inhibitory impact on KEGG pathways related to DNA replication and cell cycle, while plasma IL-1β had an inhibitory impact on fatty acid elongation in mitochondria and an activated impact in several pathways related to cellular energy metabolism. Overall, this study confirmed that many changes in lipid metabolism and immune competence of the circulating leukocytes occurred in dairy cow around calving. Interestingly, BHBA and IL-1β connected with the transcriptome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621661>Predictors of mortality in outborns with neonatal sepsis: A prospective observational study.</a></h1><p>Neonatal sepsis-related mortalities are the outcome of a complex interaction of maternal-foetal colonisation, transplacental  and physical and cellular defence mechanisms of neonates.The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk factors of mortality in outborn neonatal sepsis.A 1-year prospective observational study was undertaken at a tertiary care centre. All referred neonates with maternal and neonatal risk factors of sepsis were enrolled. Blood culture, sepsis screen and other relevant investigations were performed.The mortality rate of neonatal sepsis among outborns was 38.24%. The common presentations of these neonates were respiratory distress, lethargy and hypothermia. On univariate analysis, significant risk factors for mortality included male sex (P = 0.05), weight on admission <1500 g (P < 0.001), hypothermia (P = 0.003), respiratory distress (P = 0.04), cyanosis (P = 0.001), convulsions (P = 0.02), prolonged capillary refill time (P < 0.001), thrombocytopenia (P < 0.001), abnormal radiological finding (P = 0.01), cerebrospinal fluid cellularity (P = 0.002) and positive C-reactive protein (P < 0.001). Maternal factors such as hypertension in pregnancy (P = 0.001) and antepartum haemorrhage (P = 0.03) were associated with statistically significant mortality.

Among the components of cigarette smoke, nicotine has been identified as the main immunomodulatory molecule, however, its effect on the innate immune system is unknown. In the present study, the effect of nicotine on molecules of the innate immune system was evaluated. Lung epithelial cells and macrophages were infected with M. tuberculosis and/or treated with nicotine. The results show that nicotine alone decreases the expression of the TLR-, TLR-4, NOD- receptors in all three cell types, as well as the production of the SP-D surfactant protein in type II pneumocytes. Moreover, it was observed that nicotine decreases the production of IL-6 and CCL5 during Mtb infection in EpCs. Whereas in MDMs, there is a decrease in IL-8, IL-6, TNFα, IL-10, CCL2, CXCL9, and CXCL10 only during infection with Mtb. Although the modulation of the expression of cytokines and chemokines appears to be partially mediated by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7, blocking this receptor found no effect on the expression of receptors and SP-D. In summary, it was found that nicotine modulates the expression of innate  molecules necessary for the defense against tuberculosis.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625188>The Wnt/Ca pathway is involved in interneuronal communication mediated by tunneling nanotubes.</a></h1><p>Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are actin-based transient tubular connections that allow direct communication between distant cells. TNTs play an important role in several physiological (development, , and tissue regeneration) and pathological (cancer, neurodegeneration, and pathogens transmission) processes. Here, we report that the Wnt/Ca pathway, an intracellular cascade that is involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, has a role in TNT formation and TNT-mediated transfer of cargoes. Specifically, we found that Ca /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a transducer of the Wnt/Ca pathway, regulates TNTs in a neuronal cell line and in primary neurons. We identified the β isoform of CaMKII as a key molecule in modulating TNT formation and transfer, showing that this depends on the actin-binding activity of the protein. Finally, we found that the transfer of vesicles and aggregated α-synuclein between primary neurons can be regulated by the activation of the Wnt/Ca pathway. Our findings suggest that Wnt/Ca pathway could be a novel promising target for therapies designed to impair TNT-mediated propagation of pathogens.© 2019 Institut Pasteur.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623506>Sixteen-Week Physical Activity Intervention in Subjects With Increased Cardiometabolic Risk Shifts Innate Immune Function Towards a Less Proinflammatory State.</a></h1><p>Background Low-grade inflammation, largely mediated by monocyte-derived macrophages, contributes to atherosclerosis. Sedentary behavior is associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We examined whether reducing sedentary behavior and improving walking time improves monocyte inflammatory phenotype in subjects with increased cardiovascular risk. Methods and Results Across  waves, 16 individuals with increased cardiovascular risk performed a 16-week intervention study (age 64±6 years, body mass index 29.9±4.3 kg/m), using a device with vibration feedback to promote physical activity. Before and after intervention, we objectively examined physical activity (ActivPAL), cytokine production capacity after ex vivo stimulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, metabolism of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, circulating cytokine concentrations, and monocyte immunophenotype. Overall, no significant increase in walking time was found (1.9±0.7 to .±1. h/day, =0.07). However, strong, inverse correlations were observed between the change in walking time and the change in production of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 after lipopolysaccharide stimulation (=-0.655, -0.844, -0.672, and -0.781, respectively, all <0.05). After intervention optimization based on feedback from wave 1, participants in wave  (n=8) showed an increase in walking time (.±0.8 to 3.0±1.3 h/day, =0.001) and attenuated cytokine production of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 (all <0.05). Glycolysis (=0.08) and maximal OXPHOS (=0.04) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells decreased after intervention. Lower IL-6 concentrations (=0.06) and monocyte percentages (<0.05), but no changes in monocyte subsets were found. Conclusions Successfully improving walking time shifts innate immune function towards a less proinflammatory state, characterized by a lower capacity to produce inflammatory cytokines, in individuals with increased cardiovascular risk.

Although deregulated metabolic pathways have been implicated in HCC onset and progression, the mechanisms triggering this metabolic imbalance are yet to be explored. Here, we identified a gene signature coding catabolic enzymes (Cat-GS) involved in key metabolic pathways like amino acid, lipid, carbohydrate, drug, and retinol metabolism as suppressed in HCC. A higher expression of deregulated Cat-GS is associated with good survival and less aggressive disease state in HCC patients. On the other hand, we identified mTOR signaling as a key determinant in HCC onset and progression, whose hyperactivation is found associated with poor survival and aggressive disease state in HCC patients. Next, out of Cat-GS, we established two key regulators of alcohol metabolism, alcohol dehydrogenase 1A (ADH1A) and aldehyde dehydrogenase  (ALDH2), as being transcriptionally suppressed by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) at the downstream of mTORC1 signaling. Suppressed ADH1A and ALDH2 expression aligns well with HCC-specific molecular profile and can efficiently predict disease onset and progression, whereas higher ADH1A and ALDH2 expression is associated with good survival and less aggressive disease state in HCC patients. Overall, our  findings suggest that transcriptional suppression of alcohol metabolism regulators, ADH1A and ALDH2, at the downstream of mTOR signaling is, in part, responsible for triggering oncogenic transformation of hepatocytes resulting in disease onset and progression in HCC.Copyright © 2019 Zahid, Yao, Khan, Raza and Gou.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663136>Prognostic role of the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio for clinical outcomes of patients with progressive radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma treated by sorafenib.</a></h1><p>The lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) reflects the status of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and host .

The median OS of the low LMR group was 24.3 months and that of the high LMR group was not reached until the end of observation period (P = 0.015). The PFS curves and median PFS also differed significantly based on the LMR values (P = 0.019). In multivariate analysis, low LMR was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with progressive RAIR DTC (hazard ratio, .64; 95% confidence interval: 1.04-6.72, P = 0.041).A low LMR was associated with poor response rate, PFS, and OS in patients with progressive RAIR DTC treated with sorafenib. Thus, LMR could be a simple prognostic biomarker in patients with progressive RAIR DTC.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625163>Role of type  innate lymphoid cell and its related cytokines in tumor .</a></h1><p>Type  innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) have multiple functions that can respond to allergic diseases, parasite infection, metabolic homeostasis, tissue repair, and adipose metabolism homeostasis. In these diseases, ILC2s can be activated by various inflammatory cytokines released by damaged cells. Activated ILC2s produce different type  cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, which involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases. In recent years, the relationship between ILC2s and tumor diseases has attracted more and more attention. The role of ILC2s in tumor  depends on its surface molecules and cytokine context. This review aims to conclude tumorigenic and antitumorigenic roles of ILC2s, and the characters of ILC2s-related cytokines in tumor diseases to provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of ILC2s in tumor .© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644908>Cutaneous Immune Cell-Microbiota Interactions Are Controlled by Epidermal JunB/AP-1.</a></h1><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a multi-factorial skin disease with a complex inflammatory signature including type  and type 17 activation. Although colonization by S. aureus is common in AD, the mechanisms rendering an organism prone to dysbiosis, and the role of IL-17A in the control of S. aureus-induced skin inflammation, are not well understood. Here, we show several pathological aspects of AD, including type /type 17 immune responses, elevated IgE, barrier dysfunction, pruritus, and importantly, spontaneous S. aureus colonization in JunB mice, with a large transcriptomic overlap with AD. Additionally, using Rag1 mice, we demonstrate that adaptive immune cells are necessary for protection against S. aureus colonization. Prophylactic antibiotics, but not antibiotics after established dysbiosis, reduce IL-17A expression and skin inflammation, examined using Il17a-eGFP reporter mice. Mechanistically, keratinocytes lacking JunB exhibit higher MyD88 levels in vitro and in vivo, previously shown to regulate S. aureus colonization. In conclusion, our data identify JunB as an upstream regulator of microbiota-immune cell interactions and characterize the IL-17A response upon spontaneous dysbiosis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we mapped the genomic and transcriptomic changes in human MCs upon diverse stimuli. Our analyses revealed broad H3K4me3 domains and enhancers associated with activation. Notably, the rise of intracellular calcium concentration upon immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated crosslinking of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) resulted in genome-wide reorganization of the chromatin landscape and was associated with a specific chromatin signature, which we term Ca-dependent open chromatin (COC) domains. Examination of differentially expressed genes revealed potential effectors of MC function, and we provide evidence for fibrinogen-like protein  (FGL2) as an MC mediator with potential relevance in chronic spontaneous urticaria. Disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapped onto cis-regulatory regions of human MCs suggest that MC function may impact a broad range of pathologies. The datasets presented here constitute a resource for the further study of MC function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of our study was to analyze DNA methylation of the encoding gene (IDO1) in HNSCC.Methylation of three CpG sites within the promoter, promoter flank, and gene body was investigated and correlated with mRNA expression, immune cell infiltration, mutational burden, human papillomavirus (HPV)-status, and overall survival in a cohort of N = 528 HNSCC patients obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, IDO1 immunohistochemistry and DNA methylation analysis was performed in an independent cohort of N = 138 HNSCC samples.Significant inverse correlations of IDO1 methylation and IDO1 mRNA expression were found in the promoter and promoter flank region (Spearman's ρ = -0.163 and ρ = -0.377, respectively) while a positive correlation was present in the gene body (ρ = 0.502; all P < 0.001). IDO1 DNA methylation significantly correlated with IDO1 protein expressing immune cells as well as tumor cells. IDO1 promoter flank hypermethylation was significantly associated with poor overall survival (P < 0.001). In addition, we discovered significant correlations between IDO1 methylation and expression with RNA signatures of immune cell infiltrates and with HPV-status, mutational load (methylation only), and interferon γ signature.Our results suggest IDO1 expression levels are epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation. This study provides rationale to test IDO1 methylation as potential biomarker for prediction of response to IDO1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in HNSCC.Crown Copyright © 2019.

All were inquired about risk factors of HBV infection, vaccination, and screened for hepatitis markers. HBsAg carriers were tested for HBeAg, HBeAb, ALT, and HBV DNA. Participants were divided into group 1 of 285 (47.5%) vaccinated women ≤ 25 years, and 315 (52.5%) non-vaccinated > 25 years.The prevalence of HBcAg, HBsAg, and HBsAb were 18.3%, 5.0%, and 30.7%. Of the 110 women exposed to infection, 40 (36.4%) cleared infection, 30 (27.%) were HBsAg carriers, and 40 (36.4%) showed isolated HBcAb. HBsAg carriers were HBeAg negative, HBeAb positive, and HBV-DNA positive and had high ALT. Group 1 had significantly higher frequency of vaccination-related , lower frequency of isolated HBcAb, and susceptibles than group  (44.9%, 3.5%, and 38.6% vs. 4.1%, 9.5%, and 75.9% ). The prevalence of HBV exposure and chronic HBsAb carriers in both groups were close (4.9% and 16.5% for group 1 vs. 5.1% and 20% for group , p > 0.05).Although the outcomes of HBV infection were favorable in vaccinated group, chronic HBV represents a potential risk for MTCT that necessitates screening during pregnancy in all public health care settings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651900>The  features and defects against primary cytomegalovirus infection post-splenectomy indicate an immunocompromised status: A PRISMA-compliant meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>To evaluate if splenectomy results in severely impaired immune responses against primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection compared to the general immunocompetent population.We performed a systemic literature review to study CMV infections in splenectomized individuals, a special population group presently considered immunocompetent to viral infections. We retrieved 30 cases with established CMV infection post-splenectomy and we recorded their disease manifestations, laboratory findings, immunological studies, and histopathology reports. In addition, we retrieved numerous multidisciplinary articles in view of post-splenectomy immunology defects, as well as of immune responses to primary invading CMV in the absence of the spleen. Two clinical studies directly comparing splenectomized with nonsplenectomized individuals under severe iatrogenic immunosuppression as well as the numerically largest review articles of CMV infections in immunocompetent were retained.Splenectomy results in the loss of spleen's ability to fend-off blood-borne pathogens and impairs the link between innate and adaptive . The major post-splenectomy immune-defects against CMV are: weakened, delayed or absent anti-CMV IgM, and compensatory marked IgG response; severely impaired B-cell and CD4, CD8 T-cells function responses; and post-splenectomy, bone marrow compensates for the absence of spleen's immune responses against CMV, mimicking a monoclonal T-cell lymphoproliferative process.The puzzled diagnosis of the CMV syndrome post-splenectomy is of the most challenging and misleading, resulting in risky and costly interventions and a subsequent prolonged hospitalization ( months).

Intronic TTTTA/TTTCA repeat expansions in SAMD12 (FAME1) are the main cause of FAME in Asia. Using genome sequencing and repeat-primed PCR, we identify another site of this repeat expansion, in MARCH6 (FAME3) in four European families. Analysis of single DNA molecules with nanopore sequencing and molecular combing show that expansions range from 3.3 to 14 kb on average. However, we observe considerable variability in expansion length and structure, supporting the existence of multiple expansion configurations in blood cells and fibroblasts of the same individual. Moreover, the largest expansions are associated with micro-rearrangements occurring near the expansion in 20% of cells. This study provides further evidence that FAME is caused by intronic TTTTA/TTTCA expansions in distinct genes and reveals that expansions exhibit an unexpectedly high somatic instability that can ultimately result in genomic rearrangements.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676429>Functional relationship between CgMyD88-1 and CgMyD88- in the Pacific oyster.</a></h1><p>MyD88 is a universal adapter protein for the Toll-like receptor/interleukin-1 receptor (TLR/IL-1R) signaling pathway. Since invertebrates are believed to lack MyD88-independent pathways, MyD88 appears more critical in oyster TLR signaling pathway. In the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), two complete paralogues, named as CgMyD88-1 and CgMyD88-, have been identified. In the current study, we indicated that CgMyD88-1 and CgMyD88- might act synergistically to increase the efficiency of immune signaling by activating NF-κB transcription factor. However, we found that upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C)], CgMyD88-1 and CgMyD88- show differences in their response: CgMyD88-1 accumulated as large spots in the cytoplasm, while CgMyD88- assembled in the cytoplasm and in the membrane. Our results support the theory that expansion of these immune genes is associated with functional diversity.Copyright © 2019.

Decreased osteogenic differentiation and aberrant melatonin signalling have been demonstrated in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from AIS patients and are implicated in the pathogenesis of AIS. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these abnormal cellular features remain largely unknown. Our previous work comparing gene expression profiles between MSCs from AIS patients and healthy controls identified 1027 differentially expressed genes. In the present study, we focused on one of the most downregulated genes, SPRY4, in the MAPK signalling pathway and examined its role in osteogenic differentiation. We found that SPRY4 is markedly downregulated in AIS MSCs. Knockdown of SPRY4 impaired differentiation of healthy MSCs to osteoblasts, while SPRY4 overexpression in AIS MSCs enhanced osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, melatonin treatment boosted osteogenic differentiation, whereas SPRY4 ablation ablated the promotional effects of melatonin. Moreover, SPRY4 was upregulated by melatonin exposure and contributed to osteogenic differentiation and melatonin response in a MEK-ERK1/ dependent manner. Thus, loss of SPRY4 in bone marrow derived-MSCs results in reduced osteogenic differentiation, and these defects are further aggravated under the influence of melatonin. Our findings provide new insights for understanding the role of melatonin in AIS aetiology and highlight the importance of MSCs in AIS pathogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672317>Protein intake and amino acid supplementation regulate exercise recovery and performance through the modulation of mTOR, AMPK, FGF21, and .</a></h1><p>Exercise is considered to be the best approach to improve quality of life, and together with a healthy and adequate dietary pattern, exercise represents the best strategy to reduce the risk of chronic metabolic and inflammatory diseases, such as those related to obesity. The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino acid availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; ) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Little is known about whether social contact frequency and intensity are associated with pneumococcal carriage. In Fiji, indigenous iTaukei have higher prevalence of pneumococcal carriage compared with Fijians of Indian Descent (FID). We hypothesised that contact differences may contribute to ethnic differences in pneumococcal carriage prevalence and density.In 2015, young infants (5-8 weeks), toddlers (12-23 months), children (-6 years), and caregivers from Suva and surrounding areas, participated in a cross-sectional survey (n = 2014), three years post pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction. Demographic and contact data, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected. Pneumococci were detected, and quantified using quantitative real-time PCR, with molecular serotyping by microarray. Associations between ethnicity, contact, and pneumococcal carriage and density were estimated using multivariable generalised estimating equation regression models.iTaukei participants had larger household sizes, higher pneumococcal carriage rates, more contacts, and more frequent contacts of longer duration, compared with FID. The odds of vaccine-type carriage increased by 28% (95% CI 8-53%) P < 0.01 in association with physical contact with 7-14 year old children. iTaukei ethnicity was associated with vaccine-type carriage (aOR) 1.73; 95% CI 1.06-.82, P = 0.03) and non-vaccine type carriage (aOR 5.98; 95% CI 4.47-8.00, P < 0.01). Ethnicity and contact were not associated with pneumococcal density.iTaukei had greater frequency and intensity of contact compared with FID. Physical contact was associated with pneumococcal carriage. Observed differences in pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence between iTaukei and FID were not explained by differences in social contact patterns by ethnicity.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

In the present study, the results of the oral administration of a commercial CPV-2b modified live virus (MLV) vaccine in pups with MDA are reported. The CPV-2b vaccine was orally administered to 14 6-week-old pups with a bait. Blood samples and rectal swabs were collected at different days post-vaccination (dpv) to determine CPV- antibody titres and DNA loads. Thirteen pups were positive to serological and virological tests after the first vaccination and one pup became positive after the second vaccine administration. The findings of this study suggest that systemic  against CPV- may be achieved by the use of an MLV CPV-2b vaccine administered orally even in the presence of MDA titres that usually interfere with vaccination.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

White tail disease (WTD), caused by Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV), is a serious problem in farm cultivation and is responsible for up to 100% mortality in the post larvae stage. Molecular data on how M. rosenbergii post-larvae launches an immune response to an infection with MrNV is not currently available. We therefore compared the whole transcriptomic sequence of M. rosenbergii post-larvae before and after MrNV infection.Transcriptome for M. rosenbergii post-larvae demonstrated high completeness (BUSCO Complete: 83.4%, fragmentation: 13%, missing:3.3%, duplication:16.%; highest ExN50 value: 94%). The assembled transcriptome consists of 96,362 unigenes with N of 1308 bp. The assembled transcriptome was successfully annotated against the NCBI non-redundant arthropod database (33.75%), UniProt database (26.73%), Gene Ontology (GO) (18.98%), Evolutionary Genealogy of Genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups (EggNOG) (20.88%), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway (KEGG) (20.46%). GO annotations included immune system process, signaling, response to stimulus, and antioxidant activity. Differential abundance analysis using EdgeR showed 2413 significantly up-regulated genes and 3125 significantly down-regulated genes during the infection of MrNV.This study reported a highly complete transcriptome from the post-larvae stage of giant river prawn, M. rosenbergii. Differential abundant transcripts during MrNV infection were identified and validated by qPCR, many of these differentially abundant transcripts as key players in antiviral .

In this study, macaques infected with a barcoded SIVmac239 virus received cART beginning between 4- and 27-days post-infection, leading to the establishment of different levels of viral dissemination and persistence. Later treatment initiation led to higher SIV DNA levels maintained during treatment, which was significantly associated with an increased frequency of SIV reactivation and production of progeny capable of causing rebound viremia following treatment interruption. However, a 100-fold increase in SIV DNA in PBMCs was associated with only a -fold increase in the frequency of reactivation. These data suggest that the RCR can be established soon after infection, and that a large fraction of persistent viral DNA that accumulates after this time makes relatively little contribution to viral rebound.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636192>Polymerase III transcription is necessary for T cell priming by dendritic cells.</a></h1><p>Exposure to microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) causes dendritic cells (DCs) to undergo a remarkable activation process characterized by changes in key biochemical mechanisms. These enhance antigen processing and presentation, as well as strengthen DC capacity to stimulate naïve T cell proliferation. Here, we show that in response to the MAMPS lipopolysaccharide and polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (Poly I:C), RNA polymerase III (Pol lII)-dependent transcription and consequently tRNA gene expression are strongly induced in DCs. This is in part caused by the phosphorylation and nuclear export of MAF1 homolog negative regulator of Poll III (MAF1), via a synergistic casein kinase  (CK2)- and mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent signaling cascade downstream of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). De novo tRNA expression is necessary to augment protein synthesis and compensate for tRNA degradation driven by TLR-dependent DC exposure to type-I IFN. Although protein synthesis is not strongly inhibited in absence of RNA Pol III activity, it compromises the translation of key DC mRNAs, like those coding for costimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines, which instead can be stored in stress granules, as shown for CD86 mRNA. TLR-dependent CK2 stimulation and subsequent RNA Pol III activation are therefore key for the acquisition by DCs of their unique T cell immune-stimulatory functions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672934>OX40 expression in neutrophils promotes hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury.</a></h1><p>Neutrophils play critical roles during the initial phase of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (HIRI). However, the regulation of neutrophil activation, infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we revealed that OX40 was expressed by neutrophils, its expression in neutrophils was time-dependently upregulated following HIRI, and Ox40 knockout markedly alleviated liver injury. Compared with wild-type neutrophils, the adoptive transfer of Ox40-/- neutrophils decreased HIRI in neutrophil-depleted Rag2/Il2rg-/- or Ox40-/- mice. Moreover, consistently, the in vitro experiments showed that Ox40 not only prolonged neutrophil survival but also promoted proinflammatory cytokines, ROS production, and even neutrophil chemotaxis. Further investigation demonstrated that the knockout of Ox40 in neutrophils inhibited NF-κB signaling via the TRAF1//4 and IKKα/IKKβ/IκBα pathways. OX40L and OX86 stimulation could enhance neutrophil activation and survival in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our study provides a new understanding of OX40, which is expressed not only in adaptive immune cells but also in innate immune cells, i.e., neutrophils, contributing to the activation and survival of neutrophils. These findings provide a novel potential therapeutic target for the prevention of HIRI during liver transplantation or hepatic surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665247>Genetic Epidemiology reveals three chronic reservoir areas with recurrent population mobility challenging poliovirus eradication in Pakistan.</a></h1><p>Pakistan is among three countries endemic for wild poliovirus (WPV1) circulation, still struggling for eradication of poliomyelitis. Active clinical and environmental surveillance systems with meticulous laboratory investigations provide insights into poliovirus transmission patterns and genomic diversity to inform decisions for strategic operations required to achieve eradication.We analyzed epidemiological and virological data at molecular level to comprehend the current epidemiological status of WPV1 in Pakistan during 2015-2017. Stool specimens of AFP patients and sewage samples collected from 60 active environmental sites. Viral culturing, intratypic differentiation by real time-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing of VP1 region of poliovirus genome to determine the genetic relatedness among WPV1 strains were applied. The phylogenetic analysis were done using BEAST v2.3.0 [1] .Poliovirus isolates were grouped into eleven distinct clusters which had ≥95% nucleotide homology in VP1 coding region. Most burden of poliovirus was shared by three major reservoirs i.e. Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta block (64.% in 2015; 75.4% in 2016 and 76.7% in 2017).Environmental surveillance reveals importations and pockets of unimmunized children which dictate intensive target mop-up campaigns in such areas to contain poliovirus transmission. Decrease in number of orphan isolates reflects effective combination of AFP and ES surveillance working in Pakistan. The genetic data reflects sustained transmission within reservoir areas, further expanded by periodic importations to areas of high  reflected by immediate termination of imported viruses. However, it is suggestive that Pakistan is at-risk unless the entire country including Afghanistan attain a polio-free status. Improved immunization coverage with high quality surveillance is vital for global certification.© The Author(s) 2019.

Parasite development in the mammalian host is another feature of the infection dynamic, with trypanosomes undergoing quorum sensing (QS)-dependent differentiation between proliferative slender forms and arrested, transmissible, stumpy forms. Longstanding experimental studies have suggested that the frequency of antigenic variation and transmissibility may be linked, antigen switching being higher in developmentally competent, fly-transmissible, parasites ("pleomorphs") than in serially passaged "monomorphic" lines that cannot transmit through flies. Here, we have directly tested this tenet of the infection dynamic by using  experimental systems to reduce pleomorphism. Firstly, lines were generated that inducibly lose developmental capacity through RNAi-mediated silencing of the QS signaling machinery ("inducible monomorphs"). Secondly, de novo lines were derived that have lost the capacity for stumpy formation by serial passage ("selected monomorphs") and analyzed for their antigenic variation in comparison to isogenic preselected populations. Analysis of both inducible and selected monomorphs has established that antigen switch frequency and developmental capacity are independently selected traits. This generates the potential for diverse infection dynamics in different parasite populations where the rate of antigenic switching and transmission competence are uncoupled. Further, this may support the evolution, maintenance, and spread of important trypanosome variants such as  that exploit mechanical transmission.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Very few studies have investigated the associations between KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations and TICs, as well as their prognostic impact on Korean CMMs. Peptide nucleic acid-mediated polymerase chain reaction clamping and Mutyper and immunohistochemistry were used to detect these mutations in 47 paraffinized CMMs. BRAF and NRAS mutations were detected in 21.3% and 12.8% of CMMs, respectively. No KRAS or PIK3CA mutations were identified. NRAS mutations correlated with low FOXP3 (regulatory T lymphocyte marker) and indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase (IDO) (activated dendritic cell marker) TICs in CMMs, which is consistent with the negative correlation of regulatory T cells with NRAS mutations in TCGA data, while BRAF mutations were not associated with any TICs. In gene set enrichment analysis, BRAF and NRAS mutations were enriched in decreased CD8 (suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocyte marker) T cell-linked and increased CD4 (helper/inducer T lymphocyte marker) T cell-linked gene signatures, respectively, confirming the trend in our cohort of associations only with NRAS. BRAF or NRAS mutations alone did not affect any prognosis. In the subgroup analyses, BRAF mutations, as well as high CD4, CD8, FOXP3, and IDO TICs, caused worse overall survival in NRAS-mutated melanoma. No correlation of CD163 (monocyte-macrophage-specific marker) was detected. We found that approximately one-third of our cohort had BRAF and NRAS mutations, none had KRAS or PIK3CA mutations, and most displayed decreased anti-tumor . These findings may warrant further study on combined immunotherapeutic and molecular targeted therapy in Korean CMMs. Subgroup analyses according to TICs and BRAF/NRAS mutations may help to identify high-risk patients with worse prognoses.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Anti-HBs was measured at 0, 1, , and 3 months. The primary outcome was the percentage of responders (anti-HBs titres ≥10 IU/L) at 3 months. Immunogenicity and safety analyses were based on an intention-to-vaccinate analysis, the immunogenicity analysis with last observation carried forward for missing data, and the Bonferroni and the Benjamini-Hochberg method were applied to correct for multiple testing. The trial was registered in the Dutch National Trial Register and inclusion has been stopped (identifier NL3011; EudraCT-number 2011-005627-40).The participants were recruited between Nov 1, 2012, and Sept 1, 2017. 480 participants were randomly assigned and included in intention-to-vaccinate analyses: 124 (26%) to control, 118 (25%) to Twinrix, 114 (24%) to HBVaxPro-40, and 124 (26%) to Fendrix. At month 3 the percentage of responders was 83 (67%) of 124 (95% CI 57·9-75·1 in the control group, 94 (80%) of the 118 (71·3-86·5) in the Twinrix group, 95 (83%) of 114 (75·-89·7) in the HBVaxPro-40 group, and 108 (87%) of 124 (79·9-92·4) in the Fendrix group. Compared with the control group, the percentage of responders was superior for the HBVaxPro-40 group (adjusted difference 21·6% [95% CI 10·4-32·7], p=0·0204 [Bonferroni corrected p value]) and the Fendrix group (26·3% [15·4-37·3], p=0·0006), but not the Twinrix group (25·0% [13·0-37·0]; p=0·0846). One serious adverse event occurred (herpes zoster ophthalmicus) in the Fendrix group, which was not attributed to the vaccine.Revaccinating healthy non-responders with Fendrix or HBVaxPro-40 resulted in significantly higher proportions of responders and therefore indication for these vaccines should be expanded to enable revaccination of non-responders.National Institute for Public Health and the Environment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The main analysis compared adults with chronic plaque psoriasis receiving ustekinumab with tumour necrosis-α inhibitors (TNFi: etanercept and adalimumab) while the secondary analyses compared ustekinumab, etanercept, or methotrexate against adalimumab. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using overlap weights by propensity score to balance baseline covariates among comparison groups.We included 5,468 biologic-naïve patients subsequently exposed (951 ustekinumab; 1,313 etanercept; and 3,204 adalimumab) in the main analysis. The secondary analyses also included ,189 patients receiving methotrexate. The median (p25 - p75) follow up times for patients using ustekinumab, TNFi, adalimumab, etanercept and methotrexate were: .01 (1.16 - 3.21), 1.93 (1.05 - 3.34), 1.94 (1.09 - 3.32), 1.92 (0.93 - 3.45) and 1.43 (0.84 - .53) years, respectively. Ustekinumab, TNFi, adalimumab, etanercept and methotrexate groups had 7, 29, 23, 6 and 9 patients experiencing major CVEs, respectively. No differences in the risk of major CVEs were observed between biologic therapies (adjusted HR for ustekinumab vs TNFi: 0.96 [95%CI 0.41 - .22]; ustekinumab vs adalimumab: 0.81 [0.30 - .17]; etanercept vs adalimumab: 0.81 [0.28 - .30]) and methotrexate against adalimumab (1.05 [0.34 - 3.28]).In this large prospective cohort study, we found no significant differences in the risk of major CVEs between three different biologic therapies and methotrexate. Additional studies, with longer term follow-up, are needed to investigate the potential effects of biologic therapies on incidence of major CVEs.© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656088>Gene-gene interaction and association of Wnt/&Beta;-catenin signalling pathway gene polymorphisms with ankylosing spondylitis susceptibility in the Chinese Han population.</a></h1><p> To explore the genetic interaction between Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway genes and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in the Chinese population.  Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DKK1, LRP5, LRP6, and SOST genes were genotyped in 673 AS patients and 687 healthy controls by using SNPs can Technic. Single marker genetic association analysis was performed. Haplotypes were constructed after linkage disequilibrium analysis; additive, multiplicative, and higher-order interactions were analysed.  The DKK1 gene rs1569198 polymorphism was significantly associated with AS susceptibility in females ( = 4.55,  = .03), but the association disappeared after Bonferroni correction. Moreover, a haplotype (T-G) in the DKK1 gene showed a protective role in AS susceptibility in females ( = .04). Significant additive interactions were observed between DKK1: rs1896368 and LRP5: rs3736228, relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.08 - 0.71; attributable proportion due to interaction (AP) = 51%, 95% CI = 0.07 - 0.94, DKK1: rs1569198 and LRP5: rs3736228 (RERI = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.12 - 0.86; AP = 49%, 95% CI = 0.17 - 0.82), LRP5: rs3736228 and SOST: rs4792909 (RERI = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.002 - 0.65; AP = 41%, 95% CI = 0.01 - 0.81) in the dominant model.

Here we evaluate the responses to different levels of fat in the diet using both chow diet (CD, 13-18% fat) and a high-fat diet (HFD, 45-60% fat). We studied cohorts of BXD strains, both inbred parents C57BL/6J and DBA/2J (commonly known as B6 and D2, respectively), as well as B6D2 and D2B6 reciprocal F1 hybrids. The comparative impact of genetic and dietary factors was analyzed by profiling a range of phenotypes, most prominently their cecum bacterial composition. The parents of the BXDs and F1 hybrids express limited differences in terms of weight and body fat gain on CD. In contrast, the strain differences on HFD are substantial for percent body fat, with DBA/2J accumulating 12.5% more fat than C57BL/6J (P < 0.0001). The F1 hybrids born to DBA/2J dams (D2B6F1) have 10.6% more body fat (P < 0.001) than those born to C57BL/6J dams. Sequence analysis of the cecum microbiota reveals important differences in bacterial composition among BXD family members with a substantial shift in composition caused by HFD. Relative to CD, the HFD induces a decline in diversity at the phylum level with a substantial increase in Firmicutes (+13.8%) and a reduction in Actinobacteria (-7.9%). In the majority of BXD strains, the HFD also increases cecal sIgA (P < 0.0001)-an important component of the adaptive  response against microbial pathogens. Host genetics modulates variation in cecum bacterial composition at the genus level in CD, with significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Oscillibacter mapped to Chr 3 (18.7-19. Mb, LRS = 21.4) and for Bifidobacterium mapped to Chr 6 (89.21-89.37 Mb, LRS = 19.4). Introduction of HFD served as an environmental suppressor of these QTLs due to a reduction in the contribution of both genera (P < 0.001). Relations among liver metabolites and cecum bacterial composition were predominant in CD cohort, but these correlations do not persist following the shift to HFD. Overall, these findings demonstrate the important impact of environmental/dietary manipulation on the relationships between host genetics, gastrointestinal bacterial composition, immunological parameters, and metabolites-knowledge that will help in the understanding of the causal sources of metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646072>Autoinducer- of gut microbiota, a potential novel marker for human colorectal cancer, is associated with the activation of TNFSF9 signaling in macrophages.</a></h1><p>: The interaction between the quorum sensing (QS) molecules of gut microbiota and the  of colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been investigated before. : We measured the concentration of autoinducer- (AI-) in samples of stool, colorectal tissue, saliva and serum of CRC patients, and compared this to AI- levels in colorectal adenoma (AD) and normal colon mucosa (NC). To explore the activated signaling pathways involved, we utilized AI- extracted from  to stimulate macrophages and validated these  findings in human CRC tissues. : The AI- concentration in both colorectal tissue and stool of CRC patients was significantly higher when compared to that in AD and NC (all  values < .01). The AI- concentration along with the progression of CRC in both tissues and stools was significantly increased (= .045，= .0003, respectively). After AI- stimulation, TNFSF9 was the most significantly increased protein in macrophage cells ( < .01). TNFSF9 expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues when compared to NCs (< .0001), which was mainly derived from macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, AI- level was positively associated with CD3 + T cell numbers (= .0462), and negatively associated with CD4/CD8 ratio (= .0113) within CRC tissues. : We demonstrated for the first time that AI- may serve as a novel marker for screening CRC in the clinic.

Although common, VZV infection can be life-threatening particularly in the immunocompromised. Therefore, understanding VZV-keratinocyte interactions is important to find new treatments beyond vaccination and anti-viral drugs. In VZV- infected skin, Kallikrein 6 (KLK6), and the ubiquitin-ligase MDM2 are up-regulated concomitant with Keratin 10 (K10) down-regulation. MDM2 binds to K10 targeting it for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Preventing K10 degradation reduced VZV propagation in culture and prevented epidermal disruption in skin explants. K10 knockdown induced expression of the nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1 (NR4A1) and enhanced viral propagation in culture. NR4A1 knockdown prevented viral propagation in culture, reduced LC3 levels and increased LAMP2 expression. We therefore describe a drug-able pathway whereby MDM2 ubiquitinates and degrades K10 increasing NR4A1 expression allowing VZV replication and propagation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AML with mutated NPM1 is recognised as a separate entity in the World Health Organisation 2016 classification, and carries a relatively favourable prognosis. NPM1 mutations are predominantly 4 bp duplications or insertions in the terminal exon that arise through an unknown mechanism. Here we analyse 2430 NPM1 mutations from 2329 adult and 101 pediatric patients to address their origin. We show that NPM1 mutations display the hallmarks of replication slippage, but lack suitable germline microhomology available for priming. Insertion mutations display G/C-rich N-nucleotide tracts, with a significant bias towards polypurine and polypyrimidine stacking (p < 0.001). These features suggest terminal deoxyucleotidyl transferase (TdT) primes replication slippage through N-nucleotide addition, with longer syntheses manifesting as N-regions. The recurrent Type A, Type D and Type B mutations require 1,  and 3 N-nucleotide extensions of T, CC and CAT respectively, with the last nucleotide used as occult microhomology. This TdT-mutator model successfully predicts the relative incidence of the 256 potential 4bp insertion/duplication mutations at position c.863_864 over four orders of magnitude (rho = 0.484, p < 0.0001). Children have a different NPM1 mutation spectrum to adults, including a shift away from Type A mutations and towards longer N-regions, consistent with higher TdT activity in pediatric myeloid stem cells. These findings complement our FLT3-ITD data, suggesting illegitimate TdT activity contributes to around half of AMLs. AML may therefore reflect the price for adaptive .Copyright © 2019 American Society of Hematology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649751>Recombinant baculovirus expressing the FrC-OVA protein induces protective antitumor  in an EG7-OVA mouse model.</a></h1><p>The baculovirus (BV)  multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used in numerous protein expression systems because of its ability to infect insect cells and serves as a useful vaccination vector with several benefits, such as its low clinical risks and posttranslational modification ability. We recently reported that dendritic cells (DCs) infected with BV stimulated antitumor . The recombinant BV (rBV) also strongly stimulated peptide-specific T-cells and antitumor . In this study, the stimulation of an immune response against EG7-OVA tumors in mice by a recombinant baculovirus-based combination vaccine expressing fragment C-ovalbumin (FrC-OVA-BV; rBV) was evaluated.We constructed an rBV expressing fragment C (FrC) of tetanus toxin containing a promiscuous MHC II-binding sequence and a p30-ovalbumin (OVA) peptide that functions in the MHC I pathway. The results showed that rBV activated the CD8 T-cell-mediated response much more efficiently than the wild-type BV (wtBV). Experiments with EG7-OVA tumor mouse models showed that rBV significantly decreased tumor volume and increased survival compared with those in the wild-type BV or FrC-OVA DNA vaccine groups. In addition, a significant antitumor effect of classic prophylactic or therapeutic vaccinations was observed for rBV against EG7-OVA-induced tumors compared with that in the controls.Our findings showed that FrC-OVA-BV (rBV) induced antitumor , paving the way for its use in BV immunotherapy against malignancies.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648315>Generation and function of progenitor T cells from StemRegenin-1-expanded CD34+ human hematopoietic progenitor cells.</a></h1><p>Broader clinical application of umbilical cord blood (UCB), as a source of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), is limited by low CD34+ and T-cell numbers, contributing to slow lymphohematopoietic recovery, infection, and relapse. Studies have evaluated the safety, feasibility, and expedited neutrophil recovery associated with the transplantation of CD34+ HSPCs from ex vivo expansion cultures using the aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonist StemRegenin-1 (SR1). In a phase 1/ study of 17 patients who received combined SR1-expanded and unexpanded UCB units, a considerable advantage for enhancing T-cell chimerism was not observed. We previously showed that progenitor T (proT) cells generated in vitro from HSPCs accelerated T-cell reconstitution and restored  after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). To expedite immune recovery, we hypothesized that SR1-expanded HSPCs together with proT cells could overcome the known T-cell immune deficiency that occurs post-HSCT. Here, we show that SR1-expanded UCB can induce >250-fold expansion of CD34+ HSPCs, which can generate large numbers of proT cells upon in vitro differentiation. When compared with nonexpanded naive proT cells, SR1 proT cells also showed effective thymus-seeding and peripheral T-cell functional capabilities in vivo despite having an altered phenotype. In a competitive transfer approach, both naive and SR1 proT cells showed comparable thymus-engrafting capacities. Single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral CD3+ T cells from mice injected with either naive or SR1 proT cells revealed functional subsets of T cells with polyclonal T-cell receptor repertoires. Our findings support the use of SR1-expanded UCB grafts combined with proT-cell generation for decreasing T-cell immunodeficiency post-HSCT.© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636630>Crossroads of Cancer and HIV-1: Pathways to a Cure for HIV.</a></h1><p>Recently, a second individual (the "London patient") with HIV-1 infection and concomitant leukemia was cured of both diseases by a conditioning myeloablative regimen followed by transplantation of stem cells bearing the homozygous CCR5 Δ32 mutation. The substantial risks and cost associated with this procedure render it unfeasible on a large scale. This strategy also indicates that a common pathway toward a cure for both HIV and cancer may exist. Successful approaches to curing both diseases should ideally possess three components, i.e., (1) direct targeting of pathological cells (neoplastic cells in cancer and the HIV-infected reservoir cells), () subsequent impediment to reconstitution of the pool of pathological cells and (3) sustained, immunologic control of the disease (both diseases are characterized by detrimental immune hyper-activation that hinders successful establishment of ). In this review, we explore medications that are either investigational or FDA-approved anticancer treatments that may be employed to achieve the goal of curing HIV-1. These include: thioredoxin reductase inhibitors (phases 1-3), immune checkpoint inhibitors (phases 1, 3), Jak inhibitors (FDA approved for arthritis and multiple cancer indications, summarized in Table 1). Of note, some of these medications such as arsenic trioxide and Jak inhibitors may also reversibly down regulate CCR5 expression on CD4 T-cells, thus escaping the ethical issues of inducing or transferring mutations in CCR5 that are presently the subject of interest as it relates to HIV-1 cure strategies.Copyright © 2019 Gavegnano, Savarino, Owanikoko and Marconi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638153>A retrospective study of patients with blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever in Fiji during 2014-2015: epidemiology, clinical features, treatment and outcome.</a></h1><p>Typhoid fever is endemic in Fiji.

We examined whether established subphenotypes are present not only in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome but also in patients at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARFA) and then assessed the prognostic information of baseline subphenotyping on the evolution of host-response biomarkers and clinical outcomes.Prospective, observational cohort study.Medical ICU at a tertiary academic medical center.Mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARFA.None.We performed longitudinal measurements of 10 plasma biomarkers of host injury and inflammation. We applied unsupervised latent class analysis methods utilizing baseline clinical and biomarker variables and demonstrated that two-class models (hyper- vs hypoinflammatory subphenotypes) offered improved fit compared with one-class models in both patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and ARFA. Baseline assignment to the hyperinflammatory subphenotype (39/104 [38%] acute respiratory distress syndrome and 30/108 [28%] ARFA patients) was associated with higher severity of illness by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and incidence of acute kidney injury in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, as well as higher 30-day mortality and longer duration of mechanical ventilation in ARFA patients (p < 0.0001). Hyperinflammatory patients exhibited persistent elevation of biomarkers of innate  for up to  weeks postintubation.Our results suggest that two distinct subphenotypes are present not only in patients with established acute respiratory distress syndrome but also in patients at risk for its development. Hyperinflammatory classification at baseline is associated with higher severity of illness, worse clinical outcomes, and trajectories of persistently elevated biomarkers of host injury and inflammation during acute critical illness compared with hypoinflammatory patients.

We assumed that the population had no natural  and that vaccine effectiveness was 95% for one dose and 99.75% for two doses. Vaccinations done outside the routine schedule and in people who entered England after the age of immunization were identified from primary care records. Measles susceptibility was defined as the percentage of individuals who were not immune despite all vaccination activities. We triangulated measles susceptibility and incidence data.Median susceptibility was 4.6% (range: 1.-9.). Among cohorts eligible for two MMR vaccine doses, those born between 1998 and 2004 were most susceptible. Measles incidence was highest in these cohorts. Data from primary care and child health records were comparable for cohorts after 2000, suggesting that little supplementary vaccination took place. For cohorts before 2000, primary care data quality was insufficient for accurately estimating coverage.Triangulating routine data on measles vaccination coverage and disease surveillance provided new insights into population  and helped identify vulnerable groups, which was useful for prioritizing public health actions to close gaps in .

Since then, several murine models have suggested that immunoprotection against a previous T. gondii infection may be violated after reinfection with strains of different genotypes. This study aimed to evaluate the dissemination of the parasite after reinfection with the virulent TgCTBr9 and EGS strains in BALB/c mice chronically infected with the avirulent TgCTBr5 strain. Three mice were euthanized at , 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h post challenge (p.c.) and at 7, 14 and 30 days p.c. Intestines, mesenteric lymph nodes, lungs and brains were collected for PCR-RFLP. Blood samples were collected to measure total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a by ELISA. The reinfected animals survived and presented reduced morbidity after challenge with the virulent strains. Mice challenged with the TgCTBr9 strain showed a slight increase in anti-T. gondii IgG1. The spread of the TgCTBr5 strain was observed to occur earlier than the dissemination of the virulent TgCTBr9 or EGS strains. The TgCTBr9 strain was observed in the mesenteric lymph node at 7 days post challenge (d.p.c.); in the intestine and lungs at 14 d.p.c.; and in the brain at 30 d.p.c.

However, nothing is known about the potential interplay between Tregs and HCV. In this pilot study, we have investigated the ability of Tregs to hang HCV on and the subsequent effect on their suppressive function and phenotype. Moreover, we have evaluated how HCV could promote the recruitment of Tregs by infected primary human hepatocytes.Tregs of healthy donors were incubated with JFH-1/HCVcc. Viral inoculation was assessed using adapted assays (RT-qPCR, Flow Citometry (FACS) and Western Blot (WB). Expression of Tregs phenotypic (CD4, CD25, CD127 and Foxp3) and functional (IL-10, GZMB, TGF-β1 and IL-) markers was monitored by RT-qPCR, FACS and ELISA. Suppressive activity was validated by suppressive assays. Tregs recruitment by infected primary hepatic cells was evaluated using Boyden Chamber.Tregs express the classical HCV receptors (CD81, CLDN1 and LDLR) and some co-receptors (CD5). HCV inoculation significantly increases the suppressive phenotype and activity of Tregs, and raises their anergy by inducing an unexpected IL- production. Moreover, HCV infection induces the expression of chemokines (CCL17, CXCL16, and CCL20) by primary hepatic human hepatocytes and chemokine receptors (CCR4, CXCR6 and CCR6) by Tregs. Finally, infected hepatocytes have a significantly higher potential to recruit Tregs in a seemingly CCL20-dependent manner.Direct interaction between HCV and Tregs represents a newly defined mechanism that could potentiate HCV immune evasion and favor intratumoral recruitment contributing to HCC progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634190>Immune checkpoint inhibitors in people living with HIV: what about anti-HIV effects?</a></h1><p>: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi) have shown major therapeutic successes when used in various cancers. In the HIV field a double benefit of such ICPi should result from their dual ability to restore in-vitro HIV-specific CD8 T-cell functions and to enhance HIV production from reservoir cells, thus fulfilling the goals of the 'shock and kill' concept proposed as an HIV cure therapeutic strategy.We conducted a systematic review to identify studies reporting the tolerance profile of ICPi and their effects on HIV plasma loads (pVL), CD4 count, HIV reservoirs (cell-associated HIV-DNA) and/or HIV-specific CD8 T in PLWH.Thirty-four articles were included for a total 176 participants. 12.1% participants experienced severe adverse events and 49.4% nonsevere adverse events. pVL remained stable in 91.9% participant, showed increases in 5.8% participant, and decreases in .3%. CD4 count remained stable in 60.7% participants, showed increases in 24.6%, and decreases in 14.7%. Regarding ICPi effects on HIV-DNA and HIV-specific , we identified three distinct profiles: profile I, transient pVL increases followed by a boost in HIV-specific CD8 T cells concomitant to a decrease in HIV-DNA, reported in one participant.

Mitochondrial proteins have been discovered to modulate these signaling pathway networks, and multiple biological behaviors to adapt to various internal environments or signaling events of human pathogenesis. Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction that alters the bioenergetic and biosynthetic state might contribute to multiple diseases, including cell transformation and tumor. Multiomics studies have revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cell cycle dysregulation signaling pathways operate in human pituitary adenomas, which suggest mitochondria play critical roles in pituitary adenomas. Some drugs targeting mitochondria are found as a therapeutic strategy for pituitary adenomas, including melatonin, melatonin inhibitors, temozolomide, pyrimethamine, 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, gossypol acetate, Yougui pill, T- toxin, grifolic acid, cyclosporine A, dopamine agonists, and paeoniflorin. This article reviews the latest experimental evidence and potential biological roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial dynamics in pituitary adenoma progression, potential molecular mechanisms between mitochondria and pituitary adenoma progression, and current status and perspectives of mitochondria-based biomarkers and targeted drugs for effective management of pituitary adenomas.Copyright © 2019 Li and Zhan.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624397>[Preparation of aspirin sustained-release microsphere and its in vitro releasing property].</a></h1><p>It has been proven that acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), as a kind of classical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, not only has the effect of anti-inflammatory, but also has the function of  regulation and mineralization. However, it needs further investigation to study how to delay release of aspirin for a long time and enable to promote bone regeneration. Herein, we demonstrated that the longterm delayed release pattern of aspirin through the construction of microsphere scaffolds is promising to achieve the excellent bone regeneration.Here we synthesized three kinds of scaffolds as follows: (1) aspirin loaded calcium silicate (CaSiO) microsphere (CaSiO-aspirin) via simple immersion; () aspirin loaded polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) microsphere (PLGA-aspirin) via oil/water (O/W) emulsion; (3) aspirin loaded PLGA-CaSiO scaffold (PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin) via O/W emulsion, optimal morphology and structure of PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin scaffold was acquired through modulating the ratio between PLGA and CaSiO. Furthermore, spectrophotometer was used to monitor the concentration of the extract of the three scaffolds for different releasing time, including 1, , 4, 6, 9, 13, 17, 21, 24, 30, 36, and 45 days, aspirin loading efficiency and its accumulation releasing curves were both achieved according to the concentration of aspirin. Their sustained release effects of aspirin were evaluated eventually.Environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) results showed that the surface structure of the three kinds of scaffolds were smooth and had uniform size distribution. In addition, a small amount of PLGA-aspirin microspheres occurred to aggregation, while a small amount of CaSiO-aspirin microspheres were broken. Moreover, the PLGA-aspirin microspheres in the PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin scaffolds were uniformly adhered to the surface of CaSiO microspheres. The aspirin loadings of CaSiO-aspirin, PLGA-aspirin, and PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin were (1.06±0.04)%, (7.05±0.06)%, and (6.75±0.18)%, respectively. In addition, their corresponding time for releasing 95% of aspirin was 3, 24, and 36 days, respectively. The releasing time of PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin was longer than that of the others and the releasing rate was more stable.The microsphere scaffold of PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin composites has excellent delayedrelease effect on aspirin, which is promising for using as osteogenic materials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649152>Conservation of cell-intrinsic immune responses in diverse nonhuman primate species.</a></h1><p>Differences in immune responses across species can contribute to the varying permissivity of species to the same viral pathogen. Understanding how our closest evolutionary relatives, nonhuman primates (NHPs), confront pathogens and how these responses have evolved over time could shed light on host range barriers, especially for zoonotic infections. Here, we analyzed cell-intrinsic  of primary cells from the broadest panel of NHP species interrogated to date, including humans, great apes, and Old and New World monkeys. Our analysis of their transcriptomes after poly(I:C) transfection revealed conservation in the functional consequences of their response. In mapping reads to either the human or the species-specific genomes, we observed that with the current state of NHP annotations, the percent of reads assigned to a genetic feature was largely similar regardless of the method. Together, these data provide a baseline for the cell-intrinsic responses elicited by a potent immune stimulus across multiple NHP donors, including endangered species, and serve as a resource for refining and furthering the existing annotations of NHP genomes.© 2019 Gaska et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652599>Additional Evidence on Serological Correlates of Protection against Measles: An Observational Cohort Study among Once Vaccinated Children Exposed to Measles.</a></h1><p>To assess correlates of protection against measles and against subclinical measles virus (MV) infection, we recruited once-vaccinated children from geographic regions associated with increased MV circulation and/or at schools with low vaccination coverage in the Netherlands. Paired blood samples were collected shortly after onset of the measles outbreak and after the outbreak. A questionnaire was used to document the likelihood of exposure to MV and occurrence of measles-like symptoms. All blood samples were tested for MV-specific antibodies with five different assays. Correlates of protection were assessed by considering the lowest neutralizing antibody levels in children without MV infection, and by ROC analyses. Among 91 participants, two seronegative children (%) developed measles, and an additional 19 (23%) experienced subclinical MV infection. The correlate of protection against measles was lower than 0.345 IU/mL. We observed a decreasing attack rate of subclinical MV infection with increasing levels of specific antibodies until .1 IU/mL, above which no subclinical MV infections were detected. The ROC analyses found a correlate of protection of 1.71 IU/mL (95% CI 1.01-.11) for subclinical MV infection. Our correlates of protection were consistent with previous estimates.

As polymyxin monotherapy is associated with potential development of resistance, combination therapy is highly recommended. This study investigated the mechanism underlying the synergistic killing of polymyxin B and enrofloxacin against extensive drug-resistant (XDR) . An XDR isolate  12196 was treated with clinically relevant concentrations of polymyxin B ( mg/L) and enrofloxacin (1 mg/L) alone or in combination. Metabolome profiles were investigated from bacterial samples collected at 1-and 4-h posttreatment using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistics. Significantly perturbed metabolites ( < 0.05, fold change ≥ ) were subjected to pathway analysis. The synergistic killing by polymyxin B-enrofloxacin combination was initially driven by polymyxin B as indicated by the perturbation of lipid metabolites at 1 h in particular. The killing was subsequently driven by enrofloxacin  the inhibition of DNA replication, resulting in the accumulation of nucleotides at 4 h. Furthermore, the combination uniquely altered levels of metabolites in energy metabolism and cell envelope biogenesis. Most importantly, the combination significantly minimized polymyxin resistance  the inhibition of lipid A modification pathway, which was most evident at 4 h. This is the first study to elucidate the synergistic mechanism of polymyxin B-enrofloxacin combination against XDR . The metabolomics approach taken in this study highlights its power to elucidate the mechanism of synergistic killing by antibiotic combinations at the systems level.Copyright © 2019 Lin, Han, Zhao, Zhu, Rao, Forrest, Song, Kaye, Hertzog, Purcell, Creek, Zhou, Velkov and Li.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637329>Impact of Reduced Fluoroquinolone Use on  Infections Resulting From the Fluoroquinolone-Resistant Ribotype 027 Strain in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center.</a></h1><p>Fluoroquinolone restriction has been proposed as a control measure for  infection (CDI) outbreaks associated with fluoroquinolone-resistant ribotype 027 strains. However, relatively few reports of fluoroquinolone restriction interventions have evaluated the impact on  strain types and fluoroquinolone resistance.In a hospital and affiliated long-term care facility (LTCF), antimicrobial stewardship and environmental cleaning interventions were implemented between 2009 and 2018, and  isolates during this period (~20 per year) were ribotyped and tested for fluoroquinolone resistance by moxifloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to assess the association between use of fluoroquinolones and the percentage of CDI cases due to the 027 strain over time.Between 2009 and 2018, prescribing of fluoroquinolones to inpatients decreased by 43%, coinciding with significant reductions in the healthcare-associated CDI rates in the hospital and LTCF and a decline in the percentage of  isolates that were ribotype 027 from 70% to 10%. Ninety-five percent of ribotype 027 and 6% of non-027 isolates were moxifloxacin resistant. Hospital fluoroquinolone use was strongly correlated with the incidence of hospital-associated CDI (r = 0.79, 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.95), but LTCF fluoroquinolone use was not correlated with LTCF-associated CDI (r = 0.29, 95% confidence interval, -0.43-0.77).

Recent studies have confirmed the importance of some cytokines such as Interleukin-18 (IL-18), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and Interleukin-22 (IL-22) in the pathogenesis of the so-called bacterium. This study was designed to compare the effects of Type 1T helper (Th1), Type 2T helper (Th2) cells, Regulatory T cells (Treg) and T helper 17 (Th17) modulatory effects on the efficacy of designed H. pylori vaccine by incorporating some molecular adjuvants in Treg competent and Treg suppressed groups. A bicistronic vector was used for simultaneous expression of codon-optimized Outer inflammatory protein a (OipA) gene and modified mice IL-18, IL-17A, IL-22 and Foxp3 (forkhead box P3) cytokines from four cassettes. Immunization of mice groups was performed using produced plasmids intradermally. Specific IgG1 and IgG2 and IgA antibody titers produced in mice were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in sera and intestine obtained four weeks after the last immunization. After being stimulated with a mixture of both anti-CD28 mAb and H. pylori lysate, frequencies of single Interferon-Gamma (IFN-γ), single IL-17 and dual IFN-γ/IL-17-secreting T-cells were documented using dual-color FluoroSpot. The kinetics of Th1, Th2 and Th17 in the immunized animals was determined by relative quantification of IL-17A, IL-22, IFN-γ, IL-8, IL- and IL-4 specific mRNAs. Four weeks after bacterial challenge, quantitative colony count in the isolated and homogenized stomachs was utilized to assess the level of protective  among all groups. The results of immunologic assays showed that the highest cell-mediated  cytokines were produced in IL-17 receiving group in which the Treg responses were suppressed previously by the administration of the Foxp3 as an immunogen. In addition, potent clearance of Helicobacter pylori infection was seen in this group as well.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In wild populations of some species, including murid rodents, lifespans are substantially modified by environmental signals that affect an individual's response to such challenges as unfavourable climatic conditions, parasitic load etc. But the real impact of ageing on natural mortality of most species remains obscure. To clarify how age affects the responsiveness of organisms to environmental challenges, we performed longitudinal laboratory observations of wild-derived northern red-backed voles (Myodes rutilus). We fixed individual longevity and measured metabolic indexes (basal and maximal metabolic rates), ability to maintain body temperature under acute cooling, plasma corticosterone, indexes of acquired and innate  in the same individuals of 3-4, 6-7 and 9-10 months old. The maximum estimated lifespan was about  years 8 months, which is considerably older than in nature, but less than 30% of individuals passed the one-year milestone. Regardless of the intense mortality, in the first year of life, animals did not demonstrate any age-related deterioration in physiological functions, except leucocyte number. No consistency in any individual physiological index was found. As the individual longevity of red-backed voles varied between years of captivity, we suggest that the welfare and lifespan of wild animals in captivity may be affected by the environmental conditions in the period preceding removal of the animal from the wild.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677321>Clinical Predictors of Progression and Clearance of Low Level CMV DNAemia in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients.</a></h1><p>Low level CMV DNAemia is common and in the absence of treatment may either progress to higher viral loads that require therapy, or may spontaneously resolve. The clinical predictors of progression and spontaneous viral clearance are not well defined.We performed a retrospective cohort study of organ transplant recipients who had untreated low-level CMV DNAemia (<1000 IU/mL). Outcomes were evaluated for 8 weeks after initial viral detection and progression to CMV high viral load was defined as CMV viral load ≥1000 IU/mL. CMV DNAemia doubling time was calculated for a subset of patients with sufficient viral load timepoints.Of the 297 patients analyzed, 118/297 (39.7%) patients progressed to a high viral load and the remaining cleared DNAemia spontaneously (46.8%) or remained at low level (13.4%). In multivariate analysis, progression was significantly more likely in lung transplant recipients (Odds Ratio 3.09) and less likely in those with an episode of previously treated CMV infection (Odds Ratio 0.081). In a subset of 27 patients with progression, the doubling time for CMV DNAemia was a median of 6.1 days (range .4 - 21.8).We found that previous CMV infection significantly decreased the likelihood of low level DNAemia progression suggesting that CMV  plays a role in progression vs. spontaneous clearance.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Human MD2, an indispensable accessory protein in TLR4 signaling pathway, specifically recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS), thereby leading to the activation of TLR4 signaling pathway to produce many effectors that participate in inflammatory and immune responses against Gram-negative bacteria. Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways are first characterized in Drosophila and are reportedly present in crustaceans, but the recognition and activation mechanism of these signaling pathways in crustaceans remains unclear. In the present study, a novel ML protein was characterized in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) and designated as SpMD2. The complete SpMD2 cDNA sequence is 1114 bp long with a 465 bp open reading frame; it encodes a protein that contains 154 amino acids (aa). In the deduced protein, a signal peptide (1-21 aa residues) and a ML domain (43-151 aa residues) were predicted. SpMD2 shared a similar three-dimensional structure and a close evolutionary relationship with human MD2. SpMD2 was highly expressed in gills, hemocytes, intestine, and hepatopancreas and was upregulated in gills and hemocytes after challenges with bacteria, thereby suggesting its involvement in antibacterial defense. Western blot assay showed that SpMD2 possesses strong binding activities to different bacteria and two fungi. ELISA demonstrated that SpMD2 exhibits binding abilities to LPS, lipid A, peptidoglycan (PGN), and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Its binding ability to LPS and lipid A were stronger than to PGN or LTA, implying that SpMD2 was an important LPS-binding protein in mud crab. Bacterial clearance assay revealed that the pre-incubation of Vibrio parahemolyticus with SpMD2 facilitates bacterial clearance in vivo and that knockdown of SpMD2 dramatically suppresses the bacterial clearance and decreases the expression of several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Furthermore, SpMD2 overexpression could enhance the promoter activity of SpALF2. These results revealed that SpMD2 affects bacterial clearance by regulating AMPs. Thus, by binding to LPS and by regulating AMPs, SpMD2 may function as a potential receptor, which is involved in the recognition and activation of a certain immune signaling pathway against Gram-negative bacteria. This study provides new insights into the diverse functions of ML proteins and into the antibacterial mechanisms of crustaceans.Copyright © 2019.

The gut microbiota (GM) acts by shaping immune tolerance and regulating the Treg number and suppressive function, besides circulating neuropeptides, and other immune cells that play in concert through the gut-brain axis. Previous mouse models have shown an altered enteric flora in early stage ALS, pointing to a possible GM role in ALS pathogenesis. Fecal Microbial Transplantation (FMT) is a well-known therapeutic intervention used to re-establish the proper microenvironment and to modulate enteric and systemic .  We are going to perform a multicenter randomized double-blind clinical trial employing FMT as a therapeutic intervention for ALS patients (). Forty-two ALS patients, at an early stage, will be enrolled with a :1 allocation ratio (28 FMT-treated patients vs. 14 controls). Study duration will be 12 months per patient. Three endoscopic procedures for intestinal biopsies in FMT and control groups are predicted at baseline, month 6 and month 12; at baseline and at month 6 fresh feces from healthy donors will be infused at patients in the intervention arm. The primary outcome is a significant change in Treg number between FMT-treated patients and control arm from baseline to month 6. Secondary outcomes include specific biological aims, involving in-depth analysis of immune cells and inflammatory status changes, central and peripheral biomarkers of ALS, besides comprehensive analysis of the gut, saliva and fecal microbiota. Other secondary aims include validated clinical outcomes of ALS (survival, forced vital capacity, and modifications in ALSFRS-R), besides safety and quality of life.  We await FMT to increase Treg number and suppressive functionality, switching the immune system surrounding motorneurons to an anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective status. Extensive analysis on immune cell populations, cytokines levels, and microbiota (gut, fecal and saliva) will shed light on early processes possibly leading the degenerative ALS course.  This is the first trial with FMT as a potential intervention to modify immunological response to ALS and disease progression at an early stage.Copyright © 2019 Mandrioli, Amedei, Cammarota, Niccolai, Zucchi, D'Amico, Ricci, Quaranta, Spanu and Masucci.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624790>Characterization of a transgenic mouse model of chronic conditional platelet depletion.</a></h1><p>Platelets are widely recognized for their role in maintaining hemostasis.

When compared to an antibody depletion model, PF4-DTR mice showed similar phenotypes when challenged with tail bleed and saphenous vein measurements of hemostasis. Mice depleted with diphtheria toxin were also able to undergo adoptive transfer of platelets. If the frequency and amount of diphtheria toxin is reduced, mice can be maintained at >40% depletion for >28 days, showing that this model is tunable.When compared to the gold standard of antibody-mediated depletion, PF4-DTR mice showed similar phenotypes and should be considered an important tool for examining the impact of thrombocytopenia over longer periods of time.© 2019 The Authors.

Among 25,952 patients with IE (62. ± 18·6 years; 65.9% men), 45.9% had NIE. The incidence of IE increased from .83 to 3.73 due to the NIE incidence increment with a decline in CIE. Patients with NIE were older (63.8 years vs. 60.8 years,  < 0·001), presented a higher Charlson index (1.22 vs. 1.03,  < 0.001), a greater history of implanted cardiac devices (8.7% vs. 4.6%,  < 0.001), and higher mortality (31.5% vs. 21.7%,  < 0.001).

Providing information to farmers may help promote change, but it is unclear how this approach affects and is affected by the farmer's relationship with the advisors such as the herd veterinarian. The goal of this study was to understand how benchmarking measures related to calf immune development and growth affected farmer and veterinarian cooperation and influenced the farmer's view of the veterinarian as an advisor for calf management. Veterinarians provided their clients (n = 18 dairy farms in the lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia) with  benchmark reports providing information on transfer of passive  and calf growth. Farmers were interviewed before and after receiving these reports to understand how they perceived their veterinarian as a calf advisor. Qualitative analysis identified  major themes indicating that benchmarking (1) improved farmer perception of their veterinarian's capacities to advise on calves and () strengthened the social influence of the veterinarian.

More importantly, QA-M retained the desired drug ratio (molar ratio of Q to A = 1:4) in tumors at  and 4 h after intravenous injection for synergistic immunotherapy. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in murine orthotopic CRC by the treatment of QA-M compared to PBS and the combination of free drugs ( < 0.005). The combination of nanotherapy stimulated the host immune response to induce long-term tumor destruction and induced memory tumor surveillance with a 1.3-fold increase in survival median time compared to PBS ( < 0.0001) and a combination of free drugs ( < 0.0005). The synergistic therapeutic effect induced by codelivery of Q and A is capable of reactivating antitumor  by inducing ICD, causing cell toxicity and modulating the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. Such a combination of Q and A with synergistic effects entrapped in a simple and safe nanodelivery system may provide the potential for scale-up manufacturing and clinical applications as immunotherapeutic agents for CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659236>Immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine in children who have undergone allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant.</a></h1><p>Influenza vaccination is recommended for children following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), however there is limited evidence regarding its benefit. A prospective multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine in children who have undergone HSCT compared with healthy age-matched controls. Participants were vaccinated between 2013 and 2016 according to Australian guidelines. Influenza-specific hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titres were performed prior to each vaccination and 4 weeks following the final vaccination. A nasopharyngeal aspirate for influenza was performed on participants that developed influenza-like illness. There were 86 children recruited; 43 who had undergone HSCT and 43 controls. For the HSCT group, seroprotection and seroconversion rates were 81.4% and 60.5% for H3N2, 41.9% and 32.6% for H1N1, and 44.% and 39.5% for B strain respectively. There was a significant geometric mean fold increase to the H3N2 (GMFI 5.80, 95% CI 3.68-9.14, p < 0.001) and B (GMFI 3.44, 95% CI .36-5.00, p = 0.048) strains. Serological response was superior in age-matched controls to all vaccine strains. There were no serious adverse events following vaccination. For children who underwent HSCT, incidence of laboratory-proven influenza infection was .3%. Overall, this study provides evidence to support annual inactivated influenza vaccine administration to children following HSCT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622676>Study on Schizochytrium sp. improving the growth performance and non-specific  of golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) while not affecting the antioxidant capacity.</a></h1><p>A feeding experiment was conducted to determine the effects of Schizochytrium sp. on growth performance, antioxidant capacity and non-specific  in golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus).Two diets were formulated with or without Schizochytrium sp. supplemented (D1:0% and D2: 3%) to feed fish for 8 weeks. Results showed that growth performance, feed intake and survival rate increased significantly with Schizochytrium sp. supplemented (P < 0.05). Feed coefficient rate (FCR) of golden pompano fed the diet supplemented with Schizochytrium sp. was significantly lower than that of fish fed the control diet (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found in antioxidant capacity both in transcriptional level, including nclear factor erythroid--related factor- (Nrf2), Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein (keap1), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and enzyme activity, such as total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (P > 0.05). Gut amylase and lipase were significantly higher in dietary Schizochytrium sp. supplemented treatment than that in control group (P < 0.05). The relative peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) expression level in liver was significantly higher in Schizochytrium sp supplemented treatment than that in control one (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), IL-1R-associated kinases 4 (IRAK4), interferon regulating Factor 3 (IRF3), interferon regulating Factor 3(IRF7) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) were significantly lower in Schizochytrium sp. supplemented treatment than that in control one (P < 0.05).

In this cross-sectional study, ELISA was used to measure six markers of innate  (sCD163, CCL18, LBP, sCD14, IL-18, and CRP) in plasma from 30  mutation carriers (17 asymptomatic, 13 symptomatic) and 29 controls. Voxel based morphometry was used to model associations between marker levels and brain atrophy in mutation carriers relative to controls. Linear regression was used to model relationships between plasma marker levels with mean frontal white matter integrity [fractional anisotropy (FA)] and the FTLD modified Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes score (FTLD-CDR SB).  Plasma sCD163 was higher in symptomatic  carriers [mean 321 ng/ml (SD 125)] compared to controls [mean 248 ng/ml (SD 58);  < 0.05]. Plasma CCL18 was higher in symptomatic  carriers [mean 56.9 pg/ml (SD 19)] compared to controls [mean 40.5 pg/ml (SD 14);  < 0.05]. Elevation of plasma LBP was associated with white matter atrophy in the right frontal pole and left inferior frontal gyrus ( FWE corrected <0.05) in all mutation carriers relative to controls. Plasma LBP levels inversely correlated with bilateral frontal white matter FA (R = 0.59,  = 0.009) in mutation carriers. Elevation in plasma was positively correlated with CDR-FTLD SB (b = .27 CDR units/μg LBP/ml plasma, R = 0.76,  = 0.003) in symptomatic carriers.  FTLD- is associated with elevations in peripheral biomarkers of macrophage-mediated innate , including sCD163 and CCL18.

Iron is an essential micronutrient for both microbial pathogens and their mammalian hosts. Changes in iron availability and distribution have significant effects on pathogen virulence and on the immune response to infection. Our previously published data shows that, during the first 24 hours of life, full-term neonates have reduced overall serum iron. Transferrin saturation decreases rapidly from 45% in cord blood to ~20% by six hours post-delivery.  To study neonatal nutritional  and its role in neonatal susceptibility to infection, we will conduct an observational study on 300 full-term normal birth weight (FTB+NBW), 50 preterm normal birth weight (PTB+NBW), 50 preterm low birth weight (PTB+LBW) and 50 full-term low birth weight (FTB+LBW), vaginally-delivered neonates born at Kanifing General Hospital, The Gambia. We will characterize and quantify iron-related nutritional  during the early neonatal period and use  sentinel bacterial growth assays to assess how differences in serum iron affect bacterial growth. Blood samples will be collected from the umbilical cord (arterial and venous) and at serial time points from the neonates over the first week of life.  Currently, little is known about nutritional  in neonates. In this study, we will increase understanding of how nutritional  may protect neonates from infection during the first critical days of life by limiting the pathogenicity and virulence of neonatal sepsis causing organisms by reducing the availability of iron. Additionally, we will investigate the hypothesis that this protective mechanism may not be activated in preterm and low birth weight neonates, potentially putting these babies at an enhanced risk of neonatal infection.  clinicaltrials.gov ( ) 27/11/2017.Copyright: © 2019 Cross JH et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621182>A nuclear licence to silence transposons.</a></h1><p>Transposon silencing requires the histone methyltransferase SETDB1.

These effects are relevant in the biomedical and chemical fields due to the application of the reported data in developing therapeutic tools to modulate the functions of the immune, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and nervous systems.Accordingly, -APB acts as a modulator of adaptive and innate , including the production of cytokines and the migration of leukocytes. Additionally, reports show that -APB exerts effects on neurons, smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, and it provides a cytoprotective effect by modulation and attenuation of reactive oxygen species.The molecular pharmacology of -APB supports both its potential to act as a drug and the desirable inclusion of its moieties in new drug development.

To assess efficacy, it was essential to develop proteomics approaches to identify suitable biomarkers of inflammation as presented in this study.Serum samples were collected from a group of 4 pigs prior to (baseline), and 24 and 48 h following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation to reveal proteomic changes during inflammation. Two other pigs served as untreated controls. Proteins were separated by either 1D SDS-PAGE or 2D gel electrophoresis (2DE) prior to analysis by nano flow liquid chromatography (nLC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry.We identified 165 proteins using SDS-PAGE, of which 47 proteins were also detected by 2DE prior to nLC-MS/MS. More than half (72%) of all characterized proteins were modulated as a result of LPS stimulation, many of which are known to be involved with innate and adaptive . Pig serum samples obtained 24 h after LPS initiation of inflammation showed protein modulations of serum albumin, serotransferrin, light and heavy immunoglobulin chains (IGs), and major acute phase proteins including haptoglobin (HPT), serum amyloid A2 (SAA2), C-reactive protein (CRP), β--glycoprotein 1 (B-2GP1), alpha--HS-glycoprotein (A2HS), α-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), and α-1-acid glycoprotein (A1AG). SAA2 was distinguished from the other SAA isoforms by the unique peptide sequence of SAA2.The results provided proteomic analysis of swine serum due to LPS stimulation and indicated the importance of SAA2, which appears to be unique and may be regarded as a potential clinical diagnostic biomarker of inflammation.This article is protected by copyright.

Here we report a systematic review and meta-analysis of its effects on stress, inflammation, and  in surgical patients during the perioperative period.We searched MEDLINE, METSTR, Embase, and Web of Science for clinical studies or trials to analyse the effects of DEX on perioperative stress, inflammation, and immune function.Sixty-seven studies (including randomised controlled trials and eight cohort studies) with 4842 patients were assessed, of which 2454 patients were in DEX groups and 2388 patients were in control (without DEX) groups. DEX infusion during the perioperative period inhibited release of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol; decreased blood glucose, interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein; and increased interleukin-10 in surgical patients. In addition, the numbers of natural killer cells, B cells, and CD4 T cells, and the ratios of CD4:CD8 and Th1:Th2 were significantly increased; CD8 T-cells were decreased in the DEX group when compared with the control group.DEX, an anaesthesia adjuvant, can attenuate perioperative stress and inflammation, and protect the immune function of surgical patients, all of which may contribute to decreased postoperative complications and improved clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2019 British Journal of Anaesthesia.

Antimicrobial peptides play an important role in the immune response of the innate  of the host in the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. Russia has developed an antiviral drug Allokin-alpha on the basis of antimicrobial peptides. The active ingredient of this drug is cytokin-like peptide alloferon. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of allokin-alpha therapy on the amount of EBV DNA in saliva samples and clinical complaints in patients with chronic Epstein-Barr infection (ChEBVI).59 patients with ChEBVI were examined (45 women and 14 men; mean age 32.52 ± 1.75 years). Patients were examined quantification of DNA Epstein-Barr virus in saliva samples by the method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with hybridization-fluorescence detection in "real time" mode. The analytical sensitivity of the test system is 400 copies / ml. Patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 (25 patients) received Allokin-alpha therapy (9 injections of s / c, 1.0 mg every other day); group  (33 patients) received Valtrex (500 mg x  times / day, by mouth) for two months.59.67% of patients had negative PCR results after treatment with Allocin-alpha. Only 27.27% of patients had negative PCR results after two months of treatment with Valtrex. In a correlation analysis, a significant effect of the initial number of copies of DNA EBV on the severity of clinical complaints in patients was revealed in the general group ChEBVI.Allokin-alpha improves the recognition of virus-infected cells and helps suppress viral replication.Allocin-alpha therapy can be recommended for the treatment of chronic EBVI at a dose of 1 mg subcutaneously every other day with a course dose of at least 9 injections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619964>A Synthetic Agonist to Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Receptor- Induces Regulatory T Cell Neuroprotective Activities in Models of Parkinson's Disease.</a></h1><p>A paradigm shift has emerged in Parkinson's disease (PD) highlighting the prominent role of CD4 Tregs in pathogenesis and treatment. Bench to bedside research, conducted by others and our own laboratories, advanced a neuroprotective role for Tregs making pharmacologic transformation of immediate need. Herein, a vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor- (VIPR2) peptide agonist, LBT-3627, was developed as a neuroprotectant for PD-associated dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Employing both 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and α-synuclein (α-Syn) overexpression models in rats, the sequential administration of LBT-3627 increased Treg activity without altering cell numbers both in naïve animals and during progressive nigrostriatal degeneration. LBT-3627 administration was linked to reductions of inflammatory microglia, increased survival of dopaminergic neurons, and improved striatal densities. While α-Syn overexpression resulted in reduced Treg activity, LBT-3627 rescued these functional deficits. This occurred in a dose-dependent manner closely mimicking neuroprotection. Taken together, these data provide the basis for the use of VIPR2 agonists as potent therapeutic immune modulating agents to restore Treg activity, attenuate neuroinflammation, and interdict dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD. The data underscore an important role of  in PD pathogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Mosley, Lu, Olson, Machhi, Yan, Namminga, Smith, Shandler and Gendelman.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660257>Antibacterial immune functions of subadults and adults in a semelparous spider.</a></h1><p>Although capacity to mount an efficient immune response plays a critical role in individuals' survival, its dynamics across ontogenetic stages is still largely unexplored. Life stage-dependent variation in the encountered diversity and prevalence of parasites were proposed to contribute to stage-dependent changes in , but differences in life history objectives between developmental stages may also lead to stage-specific changes in efficiency of given immune mechanisms. The reason for this is that juveniles and subadults are unable to reproduce, therefore they invest resources mainly into survival, while adults have to partition their resources between survival and reproduction. The general trade-off between somatic maintenance and reproductive effort is expected to impair immune function. Especially so in semelparous organisms that only reproduce once throughout their lifetime, hence they do not face the trade-off between current and future reproduction. We hypothesised that in a semelparous species individuals would be characterised by decreased investment into somatic maintenance after maturation, in order to maximise their reproductive output. Accordingly, we predicted that (1) elements of somatic maintenance, such as , should be relatively weaker in adults in comparison to subadults, and () increased reproductive investment in adults should be associated with lower immune efficiency. We quantified two markers of  in subadult and adult individuals of the semelparous wolf spider  (Westring, 1861), namely bacterial growth inhibition power and bacterial cell wall lytic activity. We found that subadults showed significantly higher cell wall lytic activity than adults, but the two life stages did not differ in their capacity to inhibit bacterial growth. Also, we found weaker immune measures in mated females compared to virgins. Furthermore, in mated females bacterial growth inhibition power was negatively associated with fecundity.© 2019 Rádai et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670050>An immunomodulatory feed additive enhances in vitro viral vaccine recall antigen responses in dairy heifers.</a></h1><p>Enhancing immunological responses to vaccination is an important goal in many herd health management systems.

The objective of this study was to evaluate post-vaccine antibody titers and circulating cellular memory development in heifers fed OG and administered a commercially available modified-live bovine respiratory disease (BRD) vaccine. Twenty-four Holstein heifers were assigned to one of two diets for 170 days: Control TMR (CON; n = 11), or TMR plus OG (TRT; 9 g/100 kg BW/day; n = 13). Samples for hematology, serology, and cellular assays were collected on D-110, 0, 21, 42, and 60 of the trial. Heifers were administered two priming doses of a modified-live BRD vaccine, with a third dose given on D0. There were no significant differences in total WBC and absolute number or the percentage of circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, RBC, or platelets on D-110 through D21. On D42 and D60, CON had significantly higher numbers of lymphocytes. On D0, mean serum neutralizing (SN) titer to BHV-1 was significantly higher for CON compared to TRT. SN titers were not significantly different between CON and TRT at any other time point for BHV-1, BVDV type 1, or BVDV type . TRT mounted a significantly stronger recall proliferative response to 0.5 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of BHV-1, BVDV type 1 and BVDV type  on D42 and D60; 0.25 MOI of BVDV type 1 on D21 and D42; and 0.25 MOI BVDV type  on D42 compared to CON. IL-4 production induced by 0.5 and 1.0 MOI BHV-1 (D42 and D60); 0.25 MOI of BVDV type 1 (D21); and 0.25 and 0.5 MOI of BVDV type  (D60) were significantly higher for TRT than CON. IL-17 production induced by 0.25 MOI of BVDV type 1 was significantly higher on D60 for TRT compared to CON. IFN-gamma and IL-10 were not significantly different between treatments.

Antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract indications was compared with national guideline recommendations.A total of 662 antibiotic prescriptions from 247 ACHs were analyzed. For all prophylactic antibiotics for UTI, 51.8% were prescribed for longer than 6 months, contrary to the guideline recommendation. Most antibiotics prescribed for treatment (71.6%) were for cystitis. Cefalexin was most frequently selected for treatment of cystitis, with 10.4% of these prescriptions being concordant with the recommendations.

Given the importance of cytokines in autoimmunity, we aimed to find the cytokine profile of innate and adaptive  in vitiligo patients, and correlate them with clinical parameters. The serum levels of innate  [interleukin(IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α] and T helper(Th)1 [IL-, interferon (IFN)-γ, TNF-β], Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13) and Th17 (IL-17, IL-23) cytokines in 44 vitiligo patients were measured by multiplex cytokine assay and compared with 44 healthy subjects. All innate  (p < 0.04), Th1 (p < 0.01), Th2 (p < 0.05) and Th17 (p < 0.001) cytokines were higher in patients than controls. Total summation levels of innate  and adaptive  cytokines showed a remarkable up-regulation in the patients (p < 0.0001). The ratio of innate  to Th1 (p = 0.03), Th2 (p = 0.01) and Th17 (p = 0.03) cytokines was significantly higher in patients vs. controls. We found significant higher ratio of Th1 to Th2 cytokines and TNF-β elevated levels in patients with a family history of autoimmunity (p < 0.05). IL-4 and IL-13 (p < 0.04) levels were lower in patients with amelanotic hair. Increased IL-10 level was observed in patients with stable disease (p = 0.02).In conclusion, the profile of cytokines in patients showed a dominant role of innate  pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitiligo, which suggests the potential of targeting these cytokines for vitiligo treatment. While a higher ratio of Th1/Th2 cytokines was observed in the patients, association of decreased Th2 cytokines with disease complications suggests a protective role for Th2 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668622>Zombie-Ant Fungi Emerged from Non-manipulating, Beetle-Infecting Ancestors.</a></h1><p>The manipulation of animal behavior by parasitic organisms is one of the most complex adaptations to have arisen via natural selection. Among the most impressive examples of behavioral manipulation are the zombie-ant fungi [1]. In this association, ants are controlled to leave the colony and perform a stereotyped death grip behavior, where they bite onto vegetation over foraging trails, before being killed for the post mortem fungal growth. Manipulation functions to provide a platform outside the nest, from which fungal parasites actively shoot out spores, targeting foraging ants because within colony transmission is prevented by strong social  exhibited by social insect societies [, 3]. It is not clear how such complex examples of host manipulation arose. To address this, we performed a broad-scale phylogenetic reconstruction of the order Hypocreales, to which the zombie-ant fungi, Ophiocordyceps, belong. In order to understand the patterns of host association and host switching along the evolution of Ophiocordyceps, we performed ancestral character state reconstruction analysis. We found that zombie-ant fungi likely arose from an ancestor that infected beetle larvae residing in soil or decaying wood, similar to extant beetle-infecting Ophiocordyceps species. Surprisingly, the jump led to an extensive species radiation observed after the development of behavioral manipulation. We suggest that the jump from solitary beetle larva to ants within a colony exposed the fungus to the robust social  of ant societies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The mRNA expression level of CgDicer in hemocytes was significantly up-regulated (36.70 ± 11.10 fold, p < 0.01) after the oysters were treated with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). In the primarily cultured oyster hemocytes, the mRNA transcripts of CgDicer were significantly induced at 12 h after the stimulation with poly(I:C), which were .04-fold (p < 0.05) higher than that in control group. Immunocytochemistry assay revealed that CgDicer proteins were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of hemocytes. The two most important functional domains of CgDicer, DSRM and RIBOc, were recombinant expressed in Escherichia coli transetta (DE3), and the recombinant DSRM protein displayed significantly binding activity to dsRNA and poly(I:C) in vitro, while the recombinant RIBOc protein exhibited significantly dsRNase activity to cleave dsRNA in vitro. These results collectively suggested that CgDicer functioned as either an intracellular recognition molecule to bind dsRNA or an effector with ribonuclease activity, which might play a crucial role in anti-viral  of oyster.Copyright © 2019.

However, the activity and function of mTORC2 in distinct cells within malignant tissue in vivo is insufficiently explored. Surprisingly, in primary human and mouse colorectal cancer (CRC) samples, mTORC2 signaling could not be detected in tumor cells. In contrast, only macrophages in tumor-adjacent areas showed mTORC2 activity, which was downregulated in stromal macrophages residing within human and mouse tumor tissues. Functionally, inhibition of mTORC2 by specific deletion of Rictor in macrophages stimulated tumorigenesis in a colitis-associated CRC mouse model. This phenotype was driven by a proinflammatory reprogramming of mTORC2-deficient macrophages that promoted colitis via the cytokine SPP1/osteopontin to stimulate tumor growth. In human CRC patients, high SPP1 levels and low mTORC2 activity in tumor-associated macrophages correlated with a worsened clinical prognosis. Treatment of mice with a second-generation mTOR inhibitor that inhibits mTORC2 and mTORC1 exacerbated experimental colorectal tumorigenesis in vivo. In conclusion, mTORC2 activity is confined to macrophages in CRC and limits tumorigenesis. These results suggest activation but not inhibition of mTORC2 as a therapeutic strategy for colitis-associated CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654508>Mass Spectrometry based Identification of Urinary Antimicrobial Peptides in Dairy Cows.</a></h1><p>Urine is considered one of the biological fluids in which antimicrobial peptides are secreted or expressed. Cow urine has not been investigated for the presence of these peptides using MALDI-TOF-MS.The aim of this study is to isolate, identify and assess the antimicrobial activity of urinary antimicrobial peptides from healthy normal cycling cows.We analyzed the urine sample using diafiltration, ion exchange chromatography, reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AU-PAGE) coupled with identification through peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The in-vitro antimicrobial effects of purified fractions were assessed using radial diffusion assay (RDA) and microtitre broth dilution assay against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.Proteins corresponding to the peaks were identified using SWISSPROT protein database. This study revealed constitutive expression of β-Defensin-1 (DEFB1), β-Defensin-4A (DFB4A), Neutrophil Defensin-1 (DEF1), Neutrophil Defensin-3 (DEF3) in cow urine. The identified peptides are cationic antimicrobial peptides of the defensin family. The purified fractions exhibited antimicrobial effects in radial diffusion assay and MIC values in the range of .93-29.3 µM/L.This study concludes that cow urine, previously unexplored with regard to antimicrobial peptides, would be a promising source of highly potent AMPs and an effective alternative to the resistant antibiotics.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631812>A review of checkpoint inhibitors in the management of renal cell carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Renal cell carcinoma is a common malignancy of the genitourinary system and is the eight most common cancer type in the United States. The overall incidence of renal cell carcinoma appears to be increasing but death rates have been declining. Patients with poor risk, advanced disease have a two-year survival rate of approximately 7%. Prior to the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, and checkpoint inhibitors, IFN-α and high-dose IL-, were standard of care treatment options but, conversely, their use is now limited to select patients. Immunotherapies have played a significant role in the treatment of various cancers and have continued to expand. It is of utmost importance that practitioners include checkpoint inhibitors as treatment options for renal cell carcinoma as they mark a new era in the treatment of advanced or relapsed setting. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, avelumab, ipilimumab, and atezolizumab all play a role in management of disease as either monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Ongoing clinical trials are ongoing to further assess the benefits of inducing cellular  in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. In this article, the available data on immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of advanced or relapsed renal cell carcinoma and their place in therapy are reviewed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673002>Intestinal helminth infection enhances bacteria-induced recruitment of neutrophils to the airspace.</a></h1><p>Intestinal helminth infections elicit Th2-type , which influences host immune responses to additional threats, such as allergens, metabolic disease, and other pathogens. Th2  involves a shift of the CD4 T-cell population from type-0 to type- (Th2) with increased abundance of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. This study sought to investigate if existing gut-restricted intestinal helminth infections impact bacterial-induced acute airway neutrophil recruitment. C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups: uninfected; helminth-Heligmosomoides polygyrus infected; Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected; and coinfected. Mice infected with H. polygyrus were incubated for  weeks, followed by P. aeruginosa intranasal inoculation. Bronchial alveolar lavage, blood, and lung samples were analyzed. Interestingly, infection with gut-restricted helminths resulted in immunological and structural changes in the lung. These changes include increased lung CD4 T cells, increased Th2 cytokine expression, and airway goblet cell hyperplasia. Furthermore, coinfected mice exhibited significantly more airspace neutrophil infiltration at 6 hours following P. aeruginosa infection and exhibited an improved rate of survival compared with bacterial infected alone. These results suggest that chronic helminth infection of the intestines can influence and enhance acute airway neutrophil responses to P. aeruginosa infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544158>UKMenCar4: A cross-sectional survey of asymptomatic meningococcal carriage amongst UK adolescents at a period of low invasive meningococcal disease incidence.</a></h1><p>Carriage of , the meningococcus, is a prerequisite for invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), a potentially devastating infection that disproportionately afflicts infants and children. Humans are the sole known reservoir for the meningococcus, and it is carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx of ~10% of the population. Rates of carriage are dependent on age of the host and social and behavioural factors. In the UK, meningococcal carriage has been studied through large, multi-centre carriage surveys of adolescents in 1999, 2000, and 2001, demonstrating carriage can be affected by immunisation with the capsular group C meningococcal conjugate vaccine, inducing population  against carriage. Fifteen years after these surveys were carried out, invasive meningococcal disease incidence had declined from a peak in 1999.  The UKMenCar4 study was conducted in 2014/15 to investigate rates of carriage amongst the adolescent population during a period of low disease incidence.

The NF-κB activation process includes nuclear translocation, followed by association with basal transcription machinery. These steps are tightly regulated by posttranslational modification of the proteins involved in this pathway. We recently reported that NF-κB transactivation activity is enhanced by knockdown of diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ), which belongs to an enzyme family that phosphorylates lipidic second messenger diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid. To investigate details of the regulatory mechanism exerted by DGKζ, we identified DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 as a novel DGKζ-interacting protein and examined functional role of DDX5 in NF-κB transactivation activity. Here we show that DDX5 knockdown exerts no significant effect on nuclear translocation, but specifically attenuates Ser311 phosphorylation of p65 subunit. Luciferase reporter assay reveals that the NF-κB transcriptional activity is repressed in DDX5-knockdown cells. Furthermore, we found that DDX5 knockdown selectively downregulates the expression level of Bcl- of the NF-κB-inducible anti-apoptotic factors upon TNF-α stimulation. Considering the evidence collectively, we can infer that DGKζ-interacting multi-protein complex modulates the NF-κB transactivation activity in a negative and positive manner under conditions in which the expression level of a component of the complex is altered.Copyright © 2019.

It is associated with significant economic losses due to diarrheal disease in nursing piglets. In this study we aimed: (1) to determine the prevalence of RVC in healthy and diarrheic suckling piglets on US farms; and () to evaluate if maternal antibody (Ab) levels were associated with protection of newborn suckling piglets against RVC. There was a significantly higher prevalence (p = 0.0002) of litters with diarrhea born to gilts compared with those born to multiparous sows. Of 113 nursing piglet fecal samples tested, 76.1% were RVC RNA positive. Fecal RVC RNA was detected in significantly (p = 0.0419) higher quantities and more frequently in piglets with diarrhea compared with healthy ones (82.5 vs. 69.9%). With the exception of the historic strain Cowden (G1 genotype), field RVC strains do not replicate in cell culture, which is a major impediment for studying RVC pathogenesis and . To circumvent this, we generated RVC virus-like particles (VLPs) for Cowden (G1), RV0104 (G3) and RV0143 (G6) and used them as antigens in ELISA to detect swine RVC Abs in serum and milk from the sows. Using RVC-VLP Ab ELISA we demonstrated that sows with diarrheic litters had significantly lower RVC IgA and IgG Ab titers in milk compared to those with healthy litters. Thus, our data suggest that insufficient lactogenic protection provided by gilts plays a key role in the development of and the increased prevalence of clinical RVC disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627122>Inducing type  immune response, induction of angiogenesis, and anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties make Lacto-n-Neotetraose (LNnT) a therapeutic choice to accelerate the wound healing process.</a></h1><p>The healing process of non-healing and full-thickness wounds is currently facing some serious challenges. In such ulcers, losing a large part of skin causes a chronic infection due to the entrance of various pathogens in the wound bed. Moreover, poor vascularization, uncontrolled inflammation, and delayed re-epithelialization increase the healing time in patients suffering from such wounds. In this light, tissue engineering provides a wide range of strategies using a variety of biomaterials, biofactors and stem cells to decrease the healing time and restore the function of the damaged site. A suitable wound healing agent should possess some critical parameters such as inducing re-epithelialization, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties, and angiogenic capability. The Lacto-n-Neotetraose (LNnT) with chemical formula C26H45NO21 is an oligosaccharide present in human milk and soluble antigens extracted from Schistosoma mansoni eggs. It is reported that LNnT induces type  immune response (Th2 ). Th2  promotes re-epithelialization, angiogenesis and wound contraction by recruiting the cells which produce Th2-related cytokines. Moreover, LNnT shows some special characteristics such as angiogenic capability, anti-inflammatory, and anti-bacterial effects which can address the mentioned challenges in the treatment of non-healing and full-thickness wounds. Here, we hypothesize that utilizing LNnT is an appropriate biofactor which would improve the healing process in full-thickness and non-healing wounds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We demonstrate that the lectin receptor kinase (LecRK), LecRK-VI., is a potential receptor for extracellular NAD (eNAD) and NAD phosphate (eNADP) and plays a central role in biological induction of SAR. LecRK-VI. constitutively associates with BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1-ASSOCIATED KINASE1 (BAK1) in vivo. Furthermore, BAK1 and its homolog BAK1-LIKE1 are required for eNAD(P) signaling and SAR, and the kinase activities of LecR-VI. and BAK1 are indispensable to their function in SAR.

Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens []. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host  and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root microbiota, including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative -keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root . Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These interactions take place in a highly complex chemical landscape, the intestinal eco-active chemosphere, composed of chemical substances that positively or negatively influence bacterial growth, including those originated from nutrient uptake, and those produced by the action of the human or animal host and the intestinal microbiome. The contribution of bacteria results from their effect on the host generated molecules, on food and digested food, and organic substances from microbial origin, including from bacterial degradation. Here, we comprehensively review the main chemical substances present in the human intestinal chemosphere, particularly of those having inhibitory effects on microorganisms. With this background, and focusing on , the most relevant human pathogens from the intestinal microbiota, the microcin's history and classification, mechanisms of action, and mechanisms involved in microcin's  (in microcin producers) and resistance (non-producers) are reviewed. Products from the chemosphere likely modulate the ecological effects of microcin activity. Several cross-resistance mechanisms are shared by microcins, colicins, bacteriophages, and some conventional antibiotics, which are expected to produce cross-effects. Double-microcin-producing strains (such as microcins MccM and MccH47) have been successfully used for decades in the control of pathogenic gut organisms. Microcins are associated with successful gut colonization, facilitating translocation and invasion, leading to bacteremia, and urinary tract infections. In fact,  strains from the more invasive phylogroups (e.g., B2) are frequently microcinogenic. A publicly accessible APD3 database http://aps.unmc.edu/AP/ shows particular genes encoding microcins in 34.1% of .  strains (mostly MccV, MccM, MccH47, and MccI47), and much less in  and  (<%). Some 4.65% of  are microcinogenic (mostly with MccE492), and even less in  or  (mostly MccS). The high frequency and variety of microcins in some  indicate key ecological functions, a notion supported by their dominance in the intestinal microbiota of biosynthetic gene clusters involved in the synthesis of post-translationally modified peptide microcins.Copyright © 2019 Baquero, Lanza, Baquero, del Campo and Bravo-Vázquez.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645760>MHC-II neoantigens shape tumour  and response to immunotherapy.</a></h1><p>The ability of the immune system to eliminate and shape the immunogenicity of tumours defines the process of cancer immunoediting. Immunotherapies such as those that target immune checkpoint molecules can be used to augment immune-mediated elimination of tumours and have resulted in durable responses in patients with cancer that did not respond to previous treatments. However, only a subset of patients benefit from immunotherapy and more knowledge about what is required for successful treatment is needed. Although the role of tumour neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells in tumour rejection is well established, the roles of other subsets of T cells have received less attention. Here we show that spontaneous and immunotherapy-induced anti-tumour responses require the activity of both tumour-antigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells, even in tumours that do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. In addition, the expression of MHC class II-restricted antigens by tumour cells is required at the site of successful rejection, indicating that activation of CD4 T cells must also occur in the tumour microenvironment. These findings suggest that MHC class II-restricted neoantigens have a key function in the anti-tumour response that is nonoverlapping with that of MHC class I-restricted neoantigens and therefore needs to be considered when identifying patients who will most benefit from immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646081>Irreversible electroporation of locally advanced pancreatic cancer transiently alleviates immune suppression and creates a window for antitumor T cell activation.</a></h1><p>: Local tumor ablation through irreversible electroporation (IRE) may offer a novel therapeutic option for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).

Tumor-specific systemic T cell responses to the pancreatic cancer associated antigen Wilms Tumor (WT)1 were determined after  stimulation in an interferon-y enzyme-linked immunospot assay (Elispot), at baseline and at  weeks and 3 months after IRE. : Our data showed a transient decrease in systemic regulatory T cells (Treg) and a simultaneous transient increase in activated PD-1 T cells, consistent with the temporary reduction of tumor-related immune suppression after the IRE procedure. Accordingly, we found post-IRE boosting of a pre-existing WT1 specific T cell response in two out of three patients as well as the  induction of these responses in another two patients. There was a trend for these WT1 T cell responses to be related to longer overall survival ( = .055). : These findings are consistent with a systemic and tumor-specific immune stimulatory effect of IRE and support the combination of percutaneous IRE with therapeutic immune modulation.© 2019 The Author(s).

Limited evidence exists for the effectiveness of exercise for GTPS. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of isometric and isotonic exercise for individuals with GTPS.This randomised controlled pilot trial recruited 30 participants with GTPS. Both programmes consisted of daily, progressive home exercise for 12 weeks with 8 individual physiotherapy sessions over the trial period. The primary outcome measure was the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Gluteal (VISA-G) and secondary outcome measures included the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (0-10) and an 11-point Global Rating of Change Scale. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks.Twenty-three participants completed the trial. After 12 weeks, mean VISA-G scores improved in both groups; 55-65 in the isometric group and 62-72 in the isotonic group. 55% of the isometric group and 58% of the isotonic group achieved a reduction in pain of at least  points (minimally clinically important difference (MCID)) on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. 64% of the isometric group and 75% of the isotonic group had improved by at least  points (MCID) on the Global Rating of Change Scale.Isometric and isotonic exercise programmes appear to be effective for individuals with GTPS and should be considered in the loading management of patients with this condition.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

This approach has the potential to search for new targets for vaccine development in the predicted proteome of pathogenic organisms. To date, there is no effective vaccine employed in vaccination campaigns against visceral leishmaniasis (VL). For the first time, herein, an in silico, in vitro, and in vivo peptide screening was performed, and immunogenic peptides were selected to constitute VL peptide-based vaccines. Firstly, the screening of in silico potential peptides using dogs naturally infected by  was conducted and the peptides with the best performance were selected. The mentioned peptides were used to compose Cockt-1 (cocktail 1) and Cockt- (cocktail ) in combination with saponin as the adjuvant. Therefore, tests for immunogenicity, polyfunctional T-cells, and the ability to induce central and effector memory in T-lymphocytes capacity in reducing the parasite load on the spleen for Cockt-1 and Cockt- were performed.

We found that labyrinthopeptins A1 and A2, the prototype congeners of carbacyclic lanthipeptides, inhibit the proliferation of diverse enveloped viruses, including Dengue virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, Hepatitis C virus, Chikungunya virus, Karposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpes virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes Simplex virus, in the low μM to nM range. Mechanistic studies on viral particles revealed that labyrinthopeptins induce a virolytic effect through binding to the viral membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). These effects are enhanced by a combined equimolar application of both labyrinthopeptins, and a clear synergism was observed across a concentration range corresponding to IC-IC values of the compounds. Time-resolved experiments with large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) reveal that membrane lipid raft compositions (PC/PE/Chol/SM (17:10:33:40)) are particularly sensitive to labyrinthopeptins compared to PC/PE (90:10) LUVs, even though the overall PE-amount remains constant. Labyrinthopeptins exhibited low cytotoxicity and had favorable pharmacokinetic properties in mice (t= 10.0 h), which designates them as promising antiviral compounds acting by an unusual viral lipid targeting mechanism. For many viral infections, current treatment options are insufficient. Because the development of each antiviral drug is time-consuming and expensive, the prospect of finding broad-spectrum antivirals that can fight multiple, diverse viruses - well-known as well as (re-)emerging species - has gained attention, especially for the treatment of viral co-infections. While most known broad spectrum agents address processes in the host cell, we found that targeting lipids of the free virus outside the host cell with the natural products labyrinthopeptin A1 and A2 is a viable strategy to inhibit the proliferation of a broad range of viruses from different families, including Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus, Zika virus, Karposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpes virus, or Cytomegalovirus. Labyrinthopeptins bind to viral phosphatidylethanolamine and induce virolysis without exerting cytotoxicity to host cells. This represents a novel and unusual mechanism to tackle medically relevant viral infections.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631592>[ Rv3084 Encodes Functional Esterase and Suppresses the Pro-inflammatory Cytokines ].</a></h1><p>To explore the biological characteristics of the esterase LipR encoded by  (MTB) Rv3084 and its immunomodulatory function .The  gene was amplified from MTB H37Rv strain to construct recombinant expression plasmid. After sequencing, the recombinant plasmid was transformed into  for expression and purification of LipR protein. The expressed protein was confirmed with Western blot assay. The hydrolyzing activity of LipR was detected and the factors affecting LipR enzyme activity were analyzed. Mice were intramuscularly injected with 0.1 mL (containing plasmid DNA 100 μg) recombinant eukaryotic plasmid three times (day 1, 8, and 15); seven days after the last injection, the mice were executed, and the lung and spleen were taken for cytokine detection.The recombinant expression plasmid was successfully constructed and it was found that LipR protein was mainly expressed in the form of inclusion bodies in  with the relative molecular mass of about 33×10 . LipR was demonstrated as an alkaline eurythermic esterase, due to the preference of hydrolyzing short carbon chain esters with optimal hydrolyzing activity on pNP-acetate (pNPA, C2) and the capability in tolerance of high pH and temperature; in the presence of different detergents or metal ions, the activity of LipR hydrolyzing pNP-butyrate (pNPB, C4) was inhibited to some extent. In the mouse model, it was found that LipR could inhibit the secretion of interferon-γ (IFN- γ) and interleukin- (IL-), but to stimulate the secretion of IL-10.The esterase LipR may be one of the esterases help  withstand harsh environment inside the host in collaboration, and simultaneously act as an immune modulator to inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and consequently impact the killing effect of host immune system against .Copyright© by Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Science Edition).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620110>The Responses of Germ-Free Zebrafish () to Varying Bacterial Concentrations, Colonization Time Points, and Exposure Duration.</a></h1><p>Colonizing germ-free (GF) zebrafish with specific bacterial species provides the possibility of understanding the influence on host biological processes including gene expression, development, , and behavioral responses. It also enlightens our understanding on the host-microbe interactions within the physiological context of a living host. However, the responses of GF zebrafish to various colonization conditions such as bacterial concentrations, colonization time points, and exposure duration remain unclear. To address this issue, we explored the responses of GF zebrafish by using two bacterial species at varying concentrations, colonization time points and exposure duration. Therefore, we mono-associated GF zebrafish with  DH5α or  WB800N at concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml either at 3 day post fertilization (dpf) or 5 dpf for 24 or 48 h. We evaluated the responses of GF zebrafish by analyzing the survival rate, colonization efficiency, nutrients metabolism, intestinal cell proliferation, innate , stress, and behavior responses by comparing it to conventionally raised zebrafish (CONR) and GF zebrafish. The results indicated that the final bacteria concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml did not cause any mortality when GF mono-associated larvae were exposed to either  DH5α or  WB800N at 3 or 5 dpf, while concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml increased the mortality, particularly for 5 dpf owing to the decrease in dissolved oxygen level. The  DH5α mainly induced the expression of genes related to nutrients metabolism, cell proliferation and , while  WB800N mainly upregulated the expression of genes related to  and stress responses. Moreover, our data revealed that GF zebrafish showed higher levels of physical activity than CONR and the microbial colonization reduced the hyperactivity of GF zebrafish, suggesting colonization of bacteria affected behavior characteristics. This study provides useful information on bacterial colonization of GF zebrafish and the interaction between the host and microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Tan, Limbu, Qian, Qiao, Du and Zhang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664034>Intronic ATTTC repeat expansions in STARD7 in familial adult myoclonic epilepsy linked to chromosome .</a></h1><p>Familial Adult Myoclonic Epilepsy (FAME) is characterised by cortical myoclonic tremor usually from the second decade of life and overt myoclonic or generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Four independent loci have been implicated in FAME on chromosomes (chr) , 3, 5 and 8. Using whole genome sequencing and repeat primed PCR, we provide evidence that chr2-linked FAME (FAME2) is caused by an expansion of an ATTTC pentamer within the first intron of STARD7. The ATTTC expansions segregate in 158/158 individuals typically affected by FAME from 22 pedigrees including 16 previously reported families recruited worldwide. RNA sequencing from patient derived fibroblasts shows no accumulation of the AUUUU or AUUUC repeat sequences and STARD7 gene expression is not affected. These data, in combination with other genes bearing similar mutations that have been implicated in FAME, suggest ATTTC expansions may cause this disorder, irrespective of the genomic locus involved.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638993>Insufficient serum L-ficolin is associated with disease presence and extent of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex disease.</a></h1><p>The incidence of infectious disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria is increasing worldwide. Pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease is difficult to treat with chemotherapy, and its mechanism of infection, infection route, disease onset, and severity remain unknown. Ficolins are oligomeric defense lectins. L-ficolin plays an important role in innate . This study's aim was to identify L-ficolin's role in patients with pulmonary MAC disease.Between April 2011 and September 2017, 61 Japanese patients with pulmonary MAC disease were seen at our hospital. A control group, comprising 30 healthy individuals, without respiratory disease were enrolled in our study. The relationship between serum L-ficolin levels and disease severity was assessed, and L-ficolin's antibacterial role was examined.Serum L-ficolin levels were significantly lower in patients with pulmonary MAC disease than in healthy subjects (1.69 ± 1.27 μg/ml vs. 3.96 ± 1.42 μg/ml; p < 0.001). The cut-off value, based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis results, was .48 μg/ml (area under the curve (AUC) 0.90, sensitivity and specificity 83.6 and 86.7%, respectively). Serum L-ficolin levels were significantly lower in the patients with nodular bronchiectatic type disease compared with the patients with fibrocavitary type disease and were lower in the high-resolution computed tomography high-scoring group compared with low-scoring group. An in vitro analysis showed that purified recombinant L-ficolin bound to M. avium and its major cell wall component, lipoarabinomannan, in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, recombinant L-ficolin suppressed M. avium growth in a concentration-dependent manner.Insufficient serum L-ficolin is associated with disease progression in pulmonary MAC disease, and the level of serum L-ficolin is a possible biomarker.This study is registered with UMIN ( UMIN000022392 ).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647148>Intestinal M Cells: Tireless Samplers of Enteric Microbiota.</a></h1><p>Mucosal immune responses in the inductive lymphoid tissues of the intestine begin with uptake of particulate antigens, including components of the gut microbiota by specialized antigen sampling M cells. M cells represent a distinct lineage of enterocytes that arise from crypt stem cells in response to the cytokine RANKL. Full differentiation of M cells requires the transcription factor Spi-B to yield mature M cells that express multiple receptors for bacteria including glycoprotein  (GP2). M cell differentiation can be recapitulated in vitro using three-dimensional enteroid cultures of primary intestinal stem cells supplemented with RANKL.

Conversely, the Hygiene Hypothesis suggests that a lack of exposure to infectious agents early in life could explain the increasing incidence of allergies and autoimmunity in high-income countries. Understanding these phenomena, however, is hampered by a lack of comprehensive, direct immune monitoring in children with differing degrees of microbial exposure. Using mass cytometry, we provide an in-depth profile of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of children in regions at the extremes of exposure: the San Francisco Bay Area, USA and an economically poor district of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Despite variability in clinical health, functional characteristics of PBMCs were similar in Bangladeshi and American children at 1 year of age. However, by -3 years of age, Bangladeshi children's immune cells often demonstrated altered activation and cytokine production profiles upon stimulation with PMA-ionomycin, with an overall immune trajectory more in line with American adults. Conversely, immune responses in children from the US remained steady. Using principal component analysis, donor location, ethnic background, and cytomegalovirus infection status were found to account for some of the variation identified among samples. Within Bangladeshi 1-year-olds, stunting (as measured by height-for-age z-scores) was found to be associated with IL-8 and TGFβ expression in PMA-ionomycin stimulated samples. Combined, these findings provide important insights into the immune systems of children in high vs. low microbial exposure environments and suggest an important role for IL-8 and TGFβ in mitigating the microbial challenges faced by the Bangladeshi children.Copyright © 2019 Wagar, Bolen, Sigal, Lopez Angel, Guan, Kirkpatrick, Haque, Tibshirani, Parsonnet, Petri and Davis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624377>Generation and infusion of multi-antigen-specific T cells to prevent complications early after T-cell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplantation-a phase I/II study.</a></h1><p>Prophylactic infusion of selected donor T cells can be an effective method to restore specific  after T-cell-depleted allogeneic stem cell transplantation (TCD-alloSCT). In this phase I/II study, we aimed to reduce the risk of viral complications and disease relapses by administrating donor-derived CD8 T cells directed against cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and adenovirus antigens, tumor-associated antigens (TAA) and minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA). Twenty-seven of thirty-six screened HLA-A*02:01 patients and their CMV and/or EBV donors were included. Using MHC-I-Streptamers, 27 T-cell products were generated containing a median of 5. × 10 cells. Twenty-four products were administered without infusion-related complications at a median of 58 days post alloSCT. No patients developed graft-versus-host disease during follow-up. Five patients showed disease progression without coinciding expansion of TAA/MiHA-specific T cells. Eight patients experienced CMV- and/or EBV-reactivations. Four of these reactivations were clinically relevant requiring antiviral treatment, of which two progressed to viral disease. All resolved ultimately. In /4 patients with EBV-reactivations and 6/8 patients with CMV-reactivations, viral loads were followed by the expansion of donor-derived virus target-antigen-specific T cells. In conclusion, generation of multi-antigen-specific T-cell products was feasible, infusions were well tolerated and expansion of target-antigen-specific T cells coinciding viral reactivations was illustrated in the majority of patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650390>IRAK2 is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus risk.</a></h1><p>Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are serine-threonine kinases involved in toll-like receptor and interleukin-1 signaling pathways. They play a key role in inflammation and innate . IRAKs have been previously incriminated in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis and inhibition of IRAKs has been recently regarded as a potential therapeutic strategy for SLE.The aim of the present study was to test the association between IRAK2 rs708035 and rs3844283 with SLE.IRAK2 rs708035 and rs3844283 were genotyped by mutagenically separated polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) in 142 SLE patients and 149 age- and gender-matched controls.The hyperfunctional IRAK2 rs708035 A allele was more frequent among SLE patients than controls (62.9% versus 54.7%, p = 0.046). IRAK2 rs3844283 C allele was present in 66.5% of patients and 75.5% of controls. The CC genotype was the most frequently exhibited genotype. It was carried by 45.1% of patients with SLE and 57.7% of controls. The G allele was associated with an increased risk of SLE (OR = 1.54, 95%, CI = 1.07-.22, p = 0.017). IRAK2 rs708035 and IRAK2 rs3844283 were in linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.64). The AG haplotype was more frequently observed in SLE patients than in controls (0.292 versus 0.194, p = 0.008).This study for the first time ever reveals the association of IRAK2 rs708035 and IRAK2 rs3844283 and the corresponding haplotypes with SLE. Our findings give additional rationale to target IRAKs in the treatment of SLE.

(Turmeric).</a></h1><p> L. (turmeric) is used as a food spice; however, its strong taste restricts wider applications as a food ingredient despite its well-known health benefits. To develop an effective yet simple process for enhancing its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, turmeric was gun-puffed at various pressures. Puffed turmeric exhibited an increase in its brown color and porous structures, indicating the occurrence of the Maillard reaction and vaporization during the process. Proximal analysis revealed that puffing did not alter the major constituents, although a very small decrease in crude fat extraction was observed under some circumstances. Total phenolic compounds in the extract were significantly increased after puffing, and subsequent assessment of antioxidant capacity, as determined using independent ,-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ,'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays, demonstrated enhanced antioxidant capacity in a puffing-pressure-dependent manner. Turmeric extract was further tested for the regulation of inflammatory responses in the murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line. Suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced macrophages was amplified using puffed-turmeric extracts compared to the control extract. Furthermore, macrophage-activation assessment revealed downregulated expression of inflammation-relevant cluster of differentiation (CD)80 and CD86 using puffed-turmeric extract in a puffing-pressure-dependent manner. However, expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II, which controls adoptive , was not affected by treatment with any of the turmeric extracts. Overall, the current study demonstrated that puffing is a promising and simple method for enhancing the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of turmeric.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639584>Titanium dioxide nanoparticles temporarily influence the sea urchin immunological state suppressing inflammatory-relate gene transcription and boosting antioxidant metabolic activity.</a></h1><p>Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiONPs) are revolutionizing biomedicine due to their potential application as diagnostic and therapeutic agents. However, the TiONP immune-compatibility remains an open issue, even for ethical reasons. In this work, we investigated the immunomodulatory effects of TiONPs in an emergent proxy to human non-mammalian model for in vitro basic and translational immunology: the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. To highlight on the new insights into the evolutionarily conserved intracellular signaling and metabolism pathways involved in immune-TiONP recognition/interaction we applied a wide-ranging approach, including electron microscopy, biochemistry, transcriptomics and metabolomics. Findings highlight that TiONPs interact with immune cells suppressing the expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in immune response and apoptosis (e.g. NF-κB, FGFR2, JUN, MAPK14, FAS, VEGFR, Casp8), and boosting the immune cell antioxidant metabolic activity (e.g. pentose phosphate, cysteine-methionine, glycine-serine metabolism pathways). TiONP uptake was circumscribed to phagosomes/phagolysosomes, depicting harmless vesicular internalization. Our findings underlined that under TiONP-exposure sea urchin innate immune system is able to control inflammatory signaling, excite antioxidant metabolic activity and acquire immunological tolerance, providing a new level of understanding of the TiONP immune-compatibility that could be useful for the development in Nano medicines.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Demographic, clinical, and histopathological data were collected from electronic medical records.There were 13 patients (7 males) with a median age of 68 years (range: 39- 82) who were treated with nivolumab (n=7) or pembrolizumab (n=6). Oral irAEs included lichenoid lesions (n=10), erythema multiforme (EM) (n=), and acute graft-vs-host disease re-activation (n=1), with or without ulcerations (n=8). Four patients (31%) presented with only oral irAEs. Oral biopsies showed lichenoid mucositis (n=4). Management with topical and systemic steroids led to complete symptomatic response in most patients (n=12). PD-1 inhibitor therapy was temporarily discontinued (n=3) and discontinued indefinitely (n=) due to severe oral irAEs.Patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors may develop oral irAEs characterized by lichenoid lesions, ulcers or EM. Topical and systemic steroids appear to be effective in managing oral lesions although the severity of irAEs may necessitate PD-1 inhibitor therapy dose modification.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

If this represents a causal effect, the female/male HIV-1 prevalence ratio would increase for birth cohorts no longer receiving smallpox vaccination due to the phase-out of this vaccine.An ecological design using HIV surveys and information about smallpox vaccination coverage.Urban and rural Guinea-Bissau.Participants in HIV surveys were grouped into an age group with decreasing smallpox vaccination coverage (15-34 years) and an age group with steady smallpox vaccination coverage (≥35 years).The exposure of interest was the phase-out of the smallpox vaccine in Guinea-Bissau.HIV-1 prevalence.At both sites, the female/male HIV-1 prevalence ratio increased by calendar time for the age group with decreasing smallpox vaccination coverage; the combined female/male HIV-1 prevalence ratio among people aged 15-34 years was 1.00 (95% CI 0.17 to 5.99) in 1987-1990, 1.16 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.93) in 1996-1997, .32 (95% CI 1.51 to 3.56) in 2006-2007 (p value for no trend=0.04). There was no increase in the female-to-male HIV-1 prevalence ratio for the age group >35 years with steady smallpox vaccination coverage; 1.93 (95% CI 0.40 to 9.25) in 1987-1990, 1.32 (95% CI 0.83 to .10) in 1996-1997, 0.81 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.16) in 2006-2007 (p value for no trend=0.07).Thus, data was compatible with the deduction that the phase-out of smallpox vaccination may have increased the susceptibility to HIV-1 relatively more for women than men. Hence, phasing out smallpox vaccination may have contributed to the global increase in the female/male HIV-1 prevalence ratio among young individuals. Due to the potential fallacies of ecological studies, the results should be interpreted carefully, and this hypothesis needs further assessment. If the hypothesis is true, studies of smallpox vaccination could inform HIV-1 vaccine research.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Taiwan, where Aedes mosquitoes are prevalent, has a close relationship with Southeast Asian countries. Up to now, 21 imported cases of ZIKV infection have been reported in Taiwan, but there has been no confirmed indigenous case. The aim of this serosurvey was to assess whether there was unrecognized ZIKV infections in Taiwan.A total of 212 serum samples collected in a cross-sectional seroepidemiologic study conducted during the end of the 2015 dengue epidemic in Tainan, Taiwan, were analyzed. Anti-ZIKV IgM and IgG were tested using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) for ZIKV and four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes were performed for samples with positive anti-ZIKV antibodies. A confirmed case of ZIKV infection was defined by ZIKV PRNT titer ratio ≥ 4 compared to four DENV serotypes.The mean age of the 212 participants was 54.0 years (standard deviation 13.7 years), and female was predominant (67.0%). Anti-ZIKV IgM and IgG were detected in 0 (0%) and 9 (4.%) of the 212 participants, respectively. For the 9 samples with anti-ZIKV IgG, only 1 sample had 4 times higher ZIKV PRNT titers compared to PRNT titers against four dengue virus serotypes; this individual denied having traveled abroad.The results suggest that undetected indigenous ZIKV transmission might have occurred in Taiwan. The findings also suggest that the threat of epidemic transmission of ZIKV in Taiwan does exist due to extremely low-level of herd . Our study also indicates that serological tests for ZIKV-specific IgG remain a big challenge due to cross-reactivity, even in dengue non-endemic countries.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668442>Feeding supplemental 25-hydroxyvitamin D increases serum mineral concentrations and alters mammary  of lactating dairy cows.</a></h1><p>Objectives were to determine the effects of feeding supplemental 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] on concentrations of vitamin D metabolites and minerals in serum, mammary immune status, and responses to intramammary bacterial infection in dairy cows. Sixty multiparous, pregnant lactating Holstein cows with somatic cell count <200,000/mL were blocked by days in milk and milk yield and randomly assigned to receive a daily top-dressed dietary supplement containing 1 or 3 mg of vitamin D (1mgD or 3mgD), or 1 or 3 mg 25(OH)D (1mg25D or 3mg25D) for 28 d (n = 15/treatment). Cows were kept in a freestall barn and fed a total mixed ration in individual feeding gates. Individual dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield were recorded daily, and milk and blood samples were collected at 0, 7, 14, and 21 d relative to the start of treatment. At 21 d, cows fed 1mgD and 3mg25D received an intramammary challenge with Streptococcus uberis. Cows were observed for severity of mastitis, and blood and milk samples were collected every 12 h to measure inflammation. The 1mg25D and 3mg25D cows had greater serum 25(OH)D concentrations at 21 d compared with 1mgD and 3mgD cows (62 ± 7, 66 ± 8, 135 ± 15, and 232 ± 26 ng/mL for 1mgD, 3mgD, 1mg25D, and 3mg25D, respectively). The 3mg25D cows had greater concentrations of Ca and P in serum at 21 d compared with other treatments (Ca = .38, .4, .37, and .48 ± 0.02 mM, 1.87, 1.88, and .10 ± 0.08 mM for 1mgD, 3mgD, 1mg25D, and 3mg25D, respectively). Yields of milk and milk components, DMI, body weight, and concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and Mg in serum did not differ among treatments. Abundance of mRNA transcripts for interleukin-1β (IL1β) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in milk somatic cells before S. uberis challenge were increased in cows fed 25(OH)D compared with cows fed vitamin D. Furthermore, IL1β, iNOS, β-defensin 7, and β-defensin 10 in milk somatic cells increased as concentrations of 25(OH)D increased in serum. Cows fed 3mg25D had less severe mastitis at 60 and 72 h after challenge with S. uberis compared with cows fed 1mgD. Concentrations of bacteria, somatic cells, and serum albumin in milk after challenge did not differ between treatments; however, an interaction between treatment and day was detected for lactate dehydrogenase in milk. Expression of adhesion protein CD11b on milk neutrophils after the S. uberis challenge was greater among 3mg25D cows compared with 1mgD cows. Transcripts of CYP24A1 and iNOS in milk somatic cells during mastitis also were greater in 3mg25D cows compared with 1mgD cows. Feeding 25(OH)D increased serum 25(OH)D more effectively than supplemental vitamin D, resulting in increased serum mineral concentrations, increased expression of vitamin D-responsive genes, and altered immune responses to intramammary bacterial challenge.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

To better understand how long-term immunosuppression impacts the immune control of this EBV re-emergence, we systematically compared 10 clinically stable KTRs to 30 healthy controls (HCs). The EBV-specific T cell responses were determined in both groups by multiparameter flow cytometry with intra cellular cytokine staining (KTRs n = 10; HCs n = 15) and ELISpot-IFNγ assays (KTRs n = 7; HCs n = 7). The T/B/NK cell counts (KTRs n = 10; HCs n = 30) and the NK/T cell differentiation and activation phenotypes (KTRs n = 10; HCs n = 15/30) were also measured. We show that in KTRs, the Th1 effector CD4+ T cell responses against latent EBV proteins are weak (/7 responders). Conversely, the frequencies total EBV-specific CD8+T cells are conserved in KTRs (n = 10) and span a wider range of EBNA-3A peptides (5/7responders) than in HCs (5/7responders). Those modifications of the EBV-specific T cell response were associated with a profound CD4+ T cell lymphopenia in KTRs compared to HCs, involving the naïve CD4+ T cell subset, and a persistent activation of highly-differentiated senescent CD8+ T cells. The proportion of total NK / CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1 was also increased in KTRs. Noteworthy, PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells normalized with time after transplantation. In conclusion, we show modifications of the EBV-specific cellular  in long term transplant recipients. This may be the result of both persistent EBV antigenic stimulation and profound immunosuppression induced by anti-rejection treatments.

The European Cardiac and Respiratory Societies (ESC/ERS) and REVEAL .0 risk score calculator identify thresholds to predict 1-year mortality. This study evaluates whether cardiac-MRI thresholds can be identified and used to aid risk stratification and facilitate decision making. Methods Consecutive patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (n=438) undergoing cardiac-MRI were identified from the ASPIRE-MRI database. Thresholds were identified from a discovery cohort and evaluated in a test cohort. Results A right ventricular-end-systolic-volume-index-%predicted threshold of 227% or a left ventricular-end-diastolic-volume-index of 58ml/m2 identified patients at low (<5%) and high (>10%) risk of 1-year mortality. These metrics identified 63% and 34% of patients as low risk, respectively. A right ventricular ejection fraction >54%, 37-54% and <37% identified 21%, 43% and 36% of patients at low, intermediate and high-risk of 1-year mortality, respectively. At follow-up cardiac-MRI patients who improved to, or were maintained in a low risk group had a one-year mortality <5%. Right ventricular-end-systolic-volume-index-%predicted independently predicted outcome and when used in conjunction with the REVEAL .0 risk score calculator or a modified French Pulmonary Hypertension registry approach improved risk stratification for one-year mortality. Conclusion Cardiac-MRI can be used to risk stratify patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension using a threshold approach. Right ventricular-end-systolic-volume-index-%predicted can identify a high percentage of patients at low-risk of one-year mortality and when used in conjunction with current risk stratification approaches it can improve risk stratification.

Flagellin is the major protein component of the flagellum. Flagellin-derived peptide fragments, such as Flg22, a short active peptide derived from the highly conserved part of the N-terminal region, are recognized as PAMPs by a specific perception system present in most higher plants. Some bacteria evade the plant recognition system by altering the Flg22 region in the flagellin. Instead, a small subset of plants (i.e., Solanaceous plants) can sense these bacteria by recognizing a second region, termed FlgII-28. The function of FlgII-28 has been well documented in tomato but not in potato plants. Here, we investigated the effect of FlgII-28 on several defense responses in potato. Cytosolic calcium (Ca) elevation is an early defense response upon pathogenic infection. We generated transgenic potato plants expressing aequorin, a nontoxic Ca-activated photoprotein. The results showed that FlgII-28 stimulated strong cytosolic Ca elevation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the response was attenuated when a Ca channel blocker was added. In addition, the FlgII-28-stimulated cytosolic Ca elevation was shown to subsequently promote extracellular alkalinization, reactive oxygen species production, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, and transcriptional reprogramming of defense-related genes in potato. Interestingly, all tested defense responses caused by FlgII-28 were significantly stronger than those caused by Flg22, suggesting that FlgII-28 acts as a primary flagellar PAMP to elicit multiple defense responses in potato.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644355>Human Y Chromosome Exerts Pleiotropic Effects on Susceptibility to Atherosclerosis.</a></h1><p>The male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) remains one of the most unexplored regions of the genome. We sought to examine how the genetic variants of the MSY influence male susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis. Approach and Results: Analysis of 129 133 men from UK Biobank revealed that only one of 7 common MSY haplogroups (haplogroup I1) was associated with CAD-carriers of haplogroup I1 had ≈11% increase in risk of CAD when compared with all other haplogroups combined (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18; =6.8×10). Targeted MSY sequencing uncovered 235 variants exclusive to this haplogroup. The haplogroup I1-specific variants showed .45- and 1.56-fold respective enrichment for promoter and enhancer chromatin states, in cells/tissues relevant to atherosclerosis, when compared with other MSY variants. Gene set enrichment analysis in CAD-relevant tissues showed that haplogroup I1 was associated with changes in pathways responsible for early and late stages of atherosclerosis development including defence against pathogens, , oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial respiration, lipids, coagulation, and extracellular matrix remodeling.  was the only Y chromosome gene whose blood expression was associated with haplogroup I1. Experimental reduction of  expression in macrophages led to changes in expression of 59 pathways (28 of which overlapped with those associated with haplogroup I1) and a significant reduction in the immune costimulatory signal.Haplogroup I1 is enriched for regulatory chromatin variants in numerous cells of relevance to CAD and increases cardiovascular risk through proatherosclerotic reprogramming of the transcriptome, partly through .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658782>Methotrexate an Old Drug with New Tricks.</a></h1><p>Methotrexate (MTX) is the first line drug for the treatment of a number of rheumatic and non-rheumatic disorders. It is currently used as an anchor disease, modifying anti-rheumatic drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite the development of numerous new targeted therapies, MTX remains the backbone of RA therapy due to its potent efficacy and tolerability. There has been also a growing interest in the use of MTX in the treatment of chronic viral mediated arthritis. Many viruses-including old world alphaviruses, Parvovirus B19, hepatitis B/C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-have been associated with arthritogenic diseases and reminiscent of RA. MTX may provide benefits although with the potential risk of attenuating patients' immune surveillance capacities. In this review, we describe the emerging mechanisms of action of MTX as an anti-inflammatory drug and complementing its well-established immunomodulatory activity. The mechanisms involve adenosine signaling modulation, alteration of cytokine networks, generation of reactive oxygen species and HMGB1 alarmin suppression. We also provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of MTX toxic effects. Lastly, we discussed the efficacy, as well as the safety, of MTX used in the management of viral-related rheumatic syndromes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658543>[Clinical randomized controlled trial on influence of recombinant human growth hormone on the immune function of younger children with severe burn injuries].</a></h1><p> To preliminarily investigate the influence of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on the immune function of younger children with severe burn injuries.  A total of 30 younger children with severe burn injuries, conforming to the study criteria, were admitted to our hospital from July 2016 to July 2018. They were enrolled in the prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial and divided into group rhGH [=15, 10 boys and 5 girls, aged (22±10) months] and control group [=15, 8 boys and 7 girls, aged (21±7) months] according to the random number table. The patients in control group received anti-shock, anti-infection, and wound caring therapies, etc. On the basis of above-mentioned treatment, the patients in group rhGH were subcutaneously injected with rhGH once every night before bedding, with a dosage of 0. IU·kg(-1)·d(-1), from the 3rd day post injury for 7 consecutive days. Before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatments, the fasting peripheral venous blood was collected from patients in both groups. Blood glucose level was detected by glucometer. Percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes, CD8(+) T lymphocytes, CD3(+) T lymphocytes, CD19(+) B lymphocytes, and ratio of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to CD8(+) T lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometer. Mass concentration of serum immune globulin (Ig) A, IgG, and complement C3 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data were processed with Fisher's exact probability test, independent sample  test, analysis of variance for repeated measurement and Bonferroni correction, and Mann-Whitney  test.  (1) The blood glucose levels of children in the two groups were similar before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment (=0.474, 1.652, 1.997, >0.05). The glucose levels of children in group rhGH on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment [(6.9±1.0) and (7.7±1.1) mmol/L] were significantly higher than (5.9±0.9) mmol/L before rhGH treatment (<0.05).

The percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment[(44.7±.)%] was significantly higher than (36.5±.)% in control group (=.624, <0.05). The percentage of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment was significantly higher than that before rhGH treatment (<0.05). The percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in control group on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment were both close to the percentage before rhGH treatment (>0.05). (3) The percentage of CD8(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 3rd day of rhGH treatment was significantly lower than that in control group (=.107, <0.05). (4) The ratio of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to CD8(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment (.36±0.20) was significantly higher than 1.72±0.20 in control group (=.285, <0.05). The ratio of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to CD8(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment was significantly higher than .04±0.19 before rhGH treatment (<0.05). (5) The percentages of CD3(+) T lymphocytes and CD19(+) B lymphocytes of children in the two groups were similar before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment (=1.913, 0.552, 1.327, 1.465, 1.587, 0.407, >0.05). The percentages of CD3(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment were significantly higher than the percentage before rhGH treatment (<0.05).

The function of T cells usually decreased and even exhausted in severe TB such as multiple drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), which might lead to the failure of treatment in return. The mechanism of T cell dysfunction in TB is still not clear. In this study we set up a mouse model of T cell dysfunction by persistent  antigen stimulation and investigated the therapeutic role of interleukin  (IL-) in it. C57BL/6 mice were primed with  Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and boosted repeatedly with a combination of  fusion proteins Mtb10.4-HspX (MH) plus ESAT6-Ag85B-MPT64 -Mtb8.4-Rv2626c (LT70) or MH plus ESAT6 and CFP10 with adjuvant of N, N'-dimethyl-N, N'-dioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA) plus polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C). Following persistent antigen stimulation, the mice were treated with IL- and the therapeutic effects were analyzed. The results showed that compared with the mice that received transient antigen stimulation (boost twice), persistent antigen stimulation (boost more than 10 times) resulted in decrease of antigen specific IFN-γ and IL- production, reduction of memory CD8 T cells, over-expression of immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and impaired the protective  against bacterial challenge. Treating the T cell functionally exhausted mice with IL- restored antigen-specific T cell responses and protective efficacy.

Circulating bacteria differ genotypically from strains used in production of pertussis vaccine. Pertactin-deficient strains are highly prevalent in countries that use acellular vaccine (aP), suggesting strong aP-imposed selection of circulating bacteria. To corroborate this hypothesis, systematic studies on pertactin prevalence of infection in countries using whole-cell vaccine are needed. We provide pertussis epidemiologic data and molecular characterization of B. pertussis isolates from Buenos Aires, Argentina, during 2000-2017. This area used primary vaccination with whole-cell vaccine. Since 2002, pertussis case incidences increased at regular 4-year outbreaks; most cases were in infants <1 year of age. Of the B. pertussis isolates analyzed, 90.6% (317/350) contained the ptxP3-ptxA1-prn2-fim3- allelic profile. Immunoblotting and sequencing techniques detected only the  pertactin-deficient isolates. The low prevalence of pertactin-deficient strains in Argentina suggests that loss of pertactin gene expression might be driven by aP vaccine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628850>Immunological tolerance of low-risk HPV in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.</a></h1><p>Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is characterized by benign exophytic lesions of the respiratory tract caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), in particular low-risk HPV6 and HPV11. Aggressiveness varies greatly among patients. Surgical excision is the current standard of care for RRP, with adjuvant therapy used when surgery cannot control disease recurrence. Numerous adjuvant therapies have been used to control RRP with some success, but none are curative. Current literature supports a polarization of the adaptive immune response to a T helper type  (Th2)-like or T regulatory phenotype, driven by a complex interplay between innate , adaptive  and HPV6/11 proteins. Additionally, certain immunogenetic polymorphisms can predispose individuals to an HPV6/11-tolerant microenvironment. As a result, immunomodulatory efforts are being made to restore the host immune system to a more balanced T cell phenotype and clear viral infection. Literature has shown exciting evidence for the role of HPV vaccination with Gardasil or Gardasil-9 as both primary prevention, by decreasing incidence through childhood vaccinations, and secondary prevention, by treating active RRP disease. Multi-institution randomized clinical trials are needed to better assess their efficacy as treatment for active disease. Interestingly, a DNA vaccine has recently shown in-vitro success in generating a more robust CD8 T cell response. Furthermore, clinical trials for programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors are under investigation for RRP management. Molecular insights into RRP, in particular the interplay between RRP and the immune system, are needed to advance our understanding of this disease and may lead to the identification of immunomodulatory agents to better manage RRP.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680329></a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662347>TIPE2 specifies the functional polarization of myeloid-derived suppressor cells during tumorigenesis.</a></h1><p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are "polarized" myeloid cells that effectively promote tumorigenesis by inhibiting antitumor . How myeloid cells acquire the protumoral properties during tumorigenesis is poorly understood. We report here that the polarity protein TIPE2 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like ) mediates the functional polarization of murine and human MDSCs by specifying their pro- and antitumoral properties. Tumor cells induced the expression of TIPE2 in Gr1CD11b cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS). TIPE2 in turn increased the expression of protumoral mediators such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β while inhibiting the expression of antitumoral mediators. Consequently, tumor growth in TIPE2-deficient mice was significantly diminished, and TIPE2-deficient MDSCs markedly inhibited tumor growth upon adoptive transfer. Pharmaceutical blockade of ROS inhibited TIPE2 expression in MDSCs and reduced tumor growth in mice. These findings indicate that TIPE2 plays a key role in the functional polarization of MDSCs and represents a new therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.© 2019 Yan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632028>Self-Assembled Nanofibers Elicit Potent HPV16 E7-Specific Cellular  And Abolish Established TC-1 Graft Tumor.</a></h1><p>Vaccines are one of the most promising strategies for immunotherapy of HPV associated tumors; however, they generally lack significant clinical efficacy at present. This inefficacy might be due to inefficient generation of anti-tumor cellular immune responses.This study aimed to assess the potential of using self-assembled nanofibers as a new vaccine platform to elicit potent HPV antigen - specific anti-tumor .A HPV16 E7 peptide was chemically appended to the N terminus of self-assembling peptide Q11. The nanofibers were prepared and used to immunize mice through a preventive or therapeutic strategy in a TC-1 graft tumor model.Preventive immunization with nanofibers almost completely suppressed the growth of primarily grafted TC-1 tumors and even a re-challenge of tumor cells after a six-week rest. Therapeutic immunization significantly increased the levels of effector Th1 cells, CTLs and the cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α in E7 peptide-stimulated splenocytes, and the immunization reduced Th2, MDSC and IL-4 contents compared to the controls. The nanofiber immunization significantly suppressed the growth of established tumors and achieved 66.7% and 50% tumor-free in mice carrying -3 mm tumors and even larger tumors with a diameter of 5-6 mm respectively. In addition, the nanofibers were more efficient than the corresponding unassembled peptides for the treatment of established larger size tumors.The results indicated that self-assembling nanofibers could elicit robust HPV antigen -specific anti-tumor cellular  and are a potent antigen delivery system for HPV related tumor vaccines.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666531>Targeted deletion of NFAT-Interacting-Protein-(NIP) 45 resolves experimental asthma by inhibiting Innate Lymphoid Cells group  (ILC2).</a></h1><p>Here we investigated the role of NFAT-interacting protein (NIP)-45, an Interleukin (IL)-4 inducing Transcription Factor, and its impact on the differentiation of Group  Innate -Lymphoid -Cells (ILC2s) in the pathogenesis of asthma. NIP45, a transcription factor regulating NFATc1 activity, mRNA was found to be induced in the Peripheral Blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) of asthmatic pre-school children with allergies and in the peripheral blood CD4 T cells from adult asthmatic patients. In PBMCs of asthmatic and control children, NIP45 mRNA directly correlated with NFATc1 but not with T-bet. Targeted deletion of NIP45 in mice resulted in a protective phenotype in experimental asthma with reduced airway mucus production, airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophils. This phenotype was reversed by intranasal delivery of recombinant r-IL-33. Consistently, ILC2s and not GATA3 CD4 T-cells were decreased in the lungs of asthmatic NIP45 mice. Reduced cell number spleen ILC2s could be differentiated from NIP45 as compared to wild-type mice after in vivo injection of a microcircle-DNA vector expressing IL-25 and decreased cytokines and ILC2 markers in ILC2 differentiated from the bone marrow of NIP45 mice.

Over the last 15 years, data have begun to emerge from human and more frequently, mouse studies, that support the idea that parasitic worm infection can protect against this condition. We have therefore investigated the potential of two synthetic small molecule analogues (SMAs) of the anti-inflammatory Acanthocheilonema viteae product ES-62, to protect against metabolic dysfunction in a C57BL/6 J mouse model of high calorie-induced obesity. We found weekly subcutaneous administration of the SMAs in combination (1 μg of each), starting one week before continuous exposure to high calorie diet (HCD), decreased fasting glucose levels and reversed the impaired glucose clearance observed in male mice, when measured at approximately 7 and 13 weeks after exposure to HCD. Fasting glucose levels were also improved in male mice fed a HCD for some 38 weeks when given SMA-treatment 13 weeks after the start of HCD, indicating an SMA-therapeutic potential. For the most part, protective effects were not observed in female mice. SMA treatment also conferred protection against each of reduced ileum villus length and liver fibrosis, but more prominently in female mice. Previous studies in mice indicate that protection against metabolic dysfunction is usually associated with polarisation of the immune system towards a type-/anti-inflammatory direction but our attempts to correlate improved metabolic parameters with such changes were unsuccessful. Further analysis will therefore be required to define mechanism of action. Nevertheless, overall our data clearly show the potential of the drug-like SMAs as a preventative or treatment for metabolic dysregulation associated with obesity.Copyright © 2019.

Blood samples were obtained from each enrolled person and data about demographic variables, and medical and vaccination history were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Persons were considered uninfected if they were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBc. Also, Vaccine effectiveness was measured by calculating the risk of disease among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons and defining the percentage risk reduction of infection in the vaccinated group.A total of 2720 persons were interviewed. The rate of HBV breakthrough infection among the vaccinated group was significantly lower than in unvaccinated group. One hundred ninety-four cases with positive HBV markers of infection were identified. The risk ratio of HBV infection was 0.71, 95% CI: 0.54-0.94 (vaccinated/unvaccinated). The estimated vaccination effectiveness against Hepatitis B infection was 29% (95% CI: 6%-46%).Iran has successfully combined hepatitis B vaccination into regular immunization programs.

Based on an analysis of the function, antigen-specificity and distribution of tumor antigen-reactive T cells and Tregs in breast cancer patients and transgenic mouse tumor models we showed that tumor-specific Tregs were selectively activated in the bone marrow (BM) and egressed into the peripheral blood (PB). The BM was constantly depleted of tumor-specific Tregs and was instead a site of increased induction and activity of tumor-reactive effector/memory T cells. Treg egress from the BM was associated with activation-induced expression of peripheral homing receptors such as CCR2. Since breast cancer tissues express the CCR2 ligand CCL2, the activation and egress of tumor antigen-specific Tregs in the BM resulted in the accumulation of Tregs in breast tumor tissue. Such immune-compartmentalization and redistribution of T cell subpopulations between the BM and peripheral tissues was achieved by vaccination with adenoviral vector encoded TRP- tumor antigen in a RET transgenic mouse model of spontaneous malignant melanoma. Thus, the BM simultaneously represented a source of tumor-infiltrating Tregs and a site for the induction of endogenous tumor-specific effector T cell responses, suggesting that both antitumor  and local immune suppression are orchestrated in the BM.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623509>Subgingival Microbiota and Longitudinal Glucose Change: The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance Study (ORIGINS).</a></h1><p>Microbial communities along mucosal surfaces throughout the digestive tract are hypothesized as risk factors for impaired glucose regulation and the development of clinical cardiometabolic disease.

DNA was extracted from subgingival plaque, and V3 to V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. FPG was measured at baseline and again at  y; glucose change was defined as follow-up minus baseline. Multivariable linear models regressed -y glucose change onto baseline measures of community diversity and abundances of 369 individual taxa. A microbial dysbiosis index (MDI) summarizing top individual taxa associated with glucose change was calculated and used in regression models.

Suppression of innate immune responses is essential for the survival of all viruses. However, the interplay between innate  and HIV/SIV is only poorly characterized. We have discovered Vpx as a novel inhibitor of innate immune activation that associates with STING signalosomes and interferes with the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and the induction of innate immune genes. This new function of Vpx could be separated from its role in mediating degradation of the antiviral factor SAMHD1, and is conserved among diverse HIV-/SIV Vpx. Vpx selectively suppressed cGAS-STING-mediated nuclear factor-κB signalling. Furthermore, Vpx and Vpr had complementary activities against cGAS-STING activity. Since SIV lacking both Vpx and Vpr was less pathogenic than SIV deficient for Vpr or Vpx alone, suppression of innate  by HIV/SIV is probably a key pathogenic determinant, making it a promising target for intervention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637232>Systematic Dual Targeting of Dendritic Cell C-Type Lectin Receptor DC-SIGN and TLR7 Using a Trifunctional Mannosylated Antigen.</a></h1><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are important initiators of adaptive , and they possess a multitude of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRR) to generate an adequate T cell mediated  against invading pathogens. PRR ligands are frequently conjugated to tumor-associated antigens in a vaccination strategy to enhance the immune response toward such antigens. One of these PPRs, DC-SIGN, a member of the C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family, has been extensively targeted with Lewis structures and mannose glycans, often presented in multivalent fashion. We synthesized a library of well-defined mannosides (mono-, di-, and tri-mannosides), based on known "high mannose" structures, that we presented in a systematically increasing number of copies ( = 1, , 3, or 6), allowing us to simultaneously study the effect of mannoside configuration and multivalency on DC-SIGN binding via Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and flow cytometry. Hexavalent presentation of the clusters showed the highest binding affinity, with the hexa-α1,-di-mannoside being the most potent ligand. The four highest binding hexavalent mannoside structures were conjugated to a model melanoma gp100-peptide antigen and further equipped with a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)-agonist as adjuvant for DC maturation, creating a trifunctional vaccine conjugate. Interestingly, DC-SIGN affinity of the mannoside clusters did not directly correlate with antigen presentation enhancing properties and the α1,-di-mannoside cluster with the highest binding affinity in our library even hampered T cell activation. Overall, this systematic study has demonstrated that multivalent glycan presentation can improve DC-SIGN binding but enhanced binding cannot be directly translated into enhanced antigen presentation and the sole assessment of binding affinity is thus insufficient to determine further functional biological activity. Furthermore, we show that well-defined antigen conjugates combining two different PRR ligands can be generated in a modular fashion to increase the effectiveness of vaccine constructs.Copyright © 2019 Li, Hogervorst, Achilli, Bruijns, Arnoldus, Vivès, Wong, Thépaut, Meeuwenoord, van den Elst, Overkleeft, van der Marel, Filippov, van Vliet, Fieschi, Codée and van Kooyk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632400>, Inflammation and Heart Failure: Their Role on Cardiac Function and Iron Status.</a></h1><p> Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by subclinical systemic inflammation and immune system activation associated with iron deficiency. No data exist on the various activations of immune-mediated mechanisms of inflammation in heart failure patients with reduced/preserved ejection fraction. We aimed to (1) investigate possible differences in inflammatory parameters and oxidative stress, and () detect a different iron status between groups.  We enrolled 50 consecutive Caucasian outpatients with heart failure. All patients underwent echocardiographic measurements, laboratory determinations, evaluation of iron status and Toll-like receptors, and NF-κB expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines. All statistical calculations were made using SPSS for Mac version 21.0.  Patients with reduced ejection fraction showed significantly lower hemoglobin levels (12.3 ± 1.4 vs. 13.6 ± 1.4 g/dl), serum iron (61.4 ± 18.3 vs. 93.7 ± 33.7 mcg/dl), transferrin iron binding capacity (20.7 ± 8.4 vs. 31.1 ± 15.6 %), and e-GFR values (78.1 ± 36.1 vs. 118.1 ± 33.9 ml/min/1.73 m) in comparison to patients with preserved ejection fraction, while unsaturated iron binding capacity (272.6 ± 74.9 vs. 221.7 ± 61.4 mcg/dl), hepcidin (4.61 ± 0.89 vs. 3.28 ± 0.69 ng/ml), and creatinine (1.34 ± 0.55 vs. 1.03 ± 0.25 mg/dl) were significantly higher in the same group. When considering inflammatory parameters, patients with reduced ejection fraction showed significantly higher expression of both Toll-like receptors- (1.90 ± 0.97 vs. 1.25 ± 0.76 MFI) and Toll-like receptors-4 (4.54 ± 1.32 vs. 3.38 ± 1.62 MFI), respectively, as well as a significantly higher activity of NF-κB (.67 ± 0.60 vs. 1.07 ± 0.30). Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6, was significantly higher in patients with reduced ejection fraction, while the protective cytokine interleukin-10 was significantly lower in the same group. Correlational analyses demonstrated a significant and inverse relationship between left ventricular function and inflammatory parameters in patients with reduced ejection fraction, as well as a direct correlation between ferritin and inflammatory parameters.  Our data demonstrate a different immune-mediated inflammatory burden in heart failure patients with reduced or preserved ejection fraction, as well as significant differences in iron status. These data contribute to further elucidate pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to cardiac dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Perticone, Zito, Miceli, Pinto, Suraci, Greco, Gigliotti, Hribal, Corrao, Sesti and Perticone.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637222>Changes in Host Response to  Infection Associated With Type  Diabetes: Beyond Hyperglycemia.</a></h1><p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains as the first cause of death among infectious diseases worldwide. Global incidence of tuberculosis is in part coincident with incidence of type  diabetes (T2D). Incidence of T2D is recognized as a high-risk factor that may contribute to tuberculosis dissemination. However, mechanisms which favor infection under T2D are just starting to emerge. Here, we first discuss the evidences that are available to support a metabolic connection between TB and T2D. Then, we analyze the evidences of metabolic changes which occur during T2D gathered thus far for its influence on susceptibility to  infection and TB progression, such as hyperglycemia, increase of 1AC levels, increase of triglycerides levels, reduction of HDL-cholesterol levels, increased concentration of lipoproteins, and modification of the activity of some hormones related to the control of metabolic homeostasis.

Previously, we have shown that a recombinant BCG expressing the LTAK63 adjuvant (rBCG-LTAK63) displayed higher protection than BCG against tuberculosis challenge in mice. In order to elucidate the immune effector mechanisms induced by rBCG-LTAK63, we evaluated the immune response before and after challenge. The potential to induce an innate immune response was investigated by intraperitoneal immunization with BCG or rBCG-LTAK63: both displayed increased cellular infiltration in the peritoneum with high numbers of neutrophils at 24 h and macrophages at 7 d. The rBCG-LTAK63-immunized mice displayed increased production of Nitric Oxide at 24 h and Hydrogen Peroxide at 7 d. The number of lymphocytes was higher in the rBCG-LTAK63 group when compared to BCG. Immunophenotyping of lymphocytes showed that rBCG-LTAK63 immunization increased CD4 and CD8 T cells. An increased long-term Th1/Th17 cytokine profile was observed 90 d after subcutaneous immunization with rBCG-LTAK63. The evaluation of immune responses at 15 d after challenge showed that rBCG-LTAK63-immunized mice displayed increased TNF-α-secreting CD4 T cells and multifunctional IL- TNF-α CD4 T cells as compared to BCG-immunized mice. Our results suggest that immunization with rBCG-LTAK63 induces enhanced innate and long-term immune responses as compared to BCG. These results can be correlated with the superior protection induced against TB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619478>A regimen containing bedaquiline and delamanid compared to bedaquiline in patients with drug resistant tuberculosis.</a></h1><p>There are limited data about combining delamanid and bedaquiline in drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) regimens. Prospective long-term outcome data, including in HIV-infected persons, are unavailable.We prospectively followed up 122 South Africans (52.5% HIV-infected) with DR-TB and poor prognostic features between 2014 and 2018. We compared outcomes and safety in those who received a bedaquiline-based regimen (n=82) to those who received a bedaquiline-delamanid combination regimen (n=40).There was no significant difference in 6-month culture conversion (92.5%  81.8%; p=0.26) and 18-month favourable outcome rate (63.4%  67.5%; p=0.66) in the bedaquiline  the bedaquiline-delamanid combination group, despite the latter having more advanced drug resistance (3.7%  22.5% resistant >5 drugs; p=0.001) and higher pre-treatment failure rates (12.%  52.5% with pre-treatment MDR-TB therapy failure; p<0.001). Although the proportion of QTcF prolongation was higher in the combination group [>60 ms from baseline (p=0.001) or >450 ms during treatment (p=0.001)], there were no symptomatic cases or drug withdrawal in either group. Results were similar in HIV-infected patients.A bedaquiline-delamanid combination regimen showed comparable long-term safety, to a bedaquiline-based regimen, in patients with DR-TB irrespective of HIV status. These data inform regimen selection in patients with DR-TB from TB endemic settings.Copyright ©ERS 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649677>Neutrophils in Psoriasis.</a></h1><p>Neutrophils are the most abundant innate immune cells. The pathogenic roles of neutrophils are related to chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Psoriasis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease affecting ~-3% of the world population. The abundant presence of neutrophils in the psoriatic skin lesions serves as a typical histopathologic hallmark of psoriasis. Recent reports indicated that oxidative stress, granular components, and neutrophil extracellular traps from psoriatic neutrophils are related to the initial and maintenance phases of psoriasis. This review provides an overview on the recent (up to 2019) advances in understanding the role of neutrophils in the pathophysiology of psoriasis, including the effects of respiratory burst, degranulation, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation on psoriatic  and the clinical relationships.Copyright © 2019 Chiang, Cheng, Korinek, Lin and Hwang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634689>Pre- and post-therapy circulating immuno-stimulatory and immuno-suppressive cytokines in dogs with juvenile-onset generalized demodecosis.</a></h1><p>Overproliferation of Demodex mites in dogs with compromised  attributed to the development of canine demodecosis. Whether clinical signs of canine demodecosis are triggered by genetically-mediated speciﬁc immunodeficiency in dogs or the Demodex mites induce lesions in hair follicles and result in compromised  is yet to be fully explored. To unravel the concealments of immunosuppression in canine demodecosis the present study was aimed to estimate the levels of circulating cytokines, pre- and post-therapy in nine dogs with juvenile-onset generalized demodecosis. At day 60 post-therapy of recommended amitraz rinse, significant (p ≤ 0.02) reduction in circulating IL-10 level was observed compared to its level before the start of the therapy (day 0). However, significant alterations in circulating levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ were not observed in these dogs at day 60 post-therapy as compared to their day 0 levels. A strong positive correlation between circulating level of IL-10 and mites population was observed both on day 0 (r = 0.656; p ≤ 0.005) and day 60 post-therapy (r = 0.575; p ≤ 0.018). Therefore, our findings suggest that Demodex mites induce immunosuppression in dogs during clinical disease and mites burden seems to be responsible for the development of generalized demodecosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Since BCG immunization may also provide protection against off-target antigens, we sought to identify the impact of different BCG strains on the ontogeny of vaccine-specific and heterologous vaccine immunogenicity in the first 9 months of life, utilizing two African birth cohorts. A total of 270 infants were studied: 84 from Jos, Nigeria (vaccinated with BCG-Bulgaria) and 187 from Cape Town, South Africa (154 vaccinated with BCG-Denmark and 33 with BCG-Russia). Infant whole blood was taken at birth, 7, 15, and 36 weeks and short-term stimulated (12 h)  with BCG, Tetanus and Pertussis antigens. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, CD4+ T cell memory subset polyfunctionality was measured by analyzing permutations of TNF-α, IL-, and IFN-γ expression at each time point. Data was analyzed using FlowJo, SPICE, R, and COMPASS. We found that infants vaccinated with BCG-Denmark mounted significantly higher frequencies of BCG-stimulated CD4+ T cell responses, peaking at week 7 after immunization, and possessed durable polyfunctional CD4+ T cells that were in a more early differentiated memory stage when compared with either BCG-Bulgaria and BCG-Russia strains. The latter responses had lower polyfunctional scores and tended to accumulate in a CD4+ T cell naïve-like state (CD45RA+CD27+). Notably, BCG-Denmark immunization resulted in higher magnitudes and polyfunctional cytokine responses to heterologous vaccine antigens (Tetanus and Pertussis). Collectively, our data show that BCG strain was the strongest determinant of both BCG-stimulated and heterologous vaccine stimulated T cell magnitude and polyfunctionality. These findings have implications for vaccine policy makers, manufacturers and programs worldwide and also suggest that BCG-Denmark, the first vaccine received in many African infants, has both specific and off-target effects in the first few months of life, which may provide an immune priming benefit to other EPI vaccines.Copyright © 2019 Kiravu, Osawe, Happel, Nundalall, Wendoh, Beer, Dontsa, Alinde, Mohammed, Datong, Cameron, Rosenthal, Abimiku, Jaspan and Gray.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630404>Neutrophils rapidly produce Th2 cytokines in response to larval but not adult helminth antigen.</a></h1><p>Host protective  to Haemonchus contortus (Hc) infection in parasite-resistant St. Croix (STC) sheep is initiated early and characterized by an influx of innate cells and robust interleukin-4 (IL-4) production, resulting in T helper type  immune (Th2) responses. The purpose of these studies was to elucidate the source of early IL-4 production. Neutrophils were isolated from whole blood, populations >98% purity was cultured with larval or adult antigen to access cytokine production. Interleukin-4 and IL-13 were measured in sample supernatant using an ovine-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Neutrophils exposed to HcLA peaked in IL-4 production at 30 min (STC, 3153.65 pg/ml and SUF, 4665.22 pg/ml). A similar trend observed in IL-13 production by 6 hours (STC, 391.02 pg/ml and SUF, 419.6 pg/ml).

Serum IgG antibodies were measured by ELISA. Results were analyzed by the Chi-square test; a p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The number of seropositive participants (%) was 308 (94.5%) for rubella, 295 (90.5%) for VZV, 244 (74.9%) for measles, and 219 (67.%) for mumps. A significant correlation was found between measles IgG and age. A relationship was also observed between VZV IgG and kindergarten attendance.

Thus, we conducted this study to investigate the role of epithelial cell-derived cytokines in the development of WRS among bakery workers.We recruited 385 wheat-exposed subjects with WRS (WRS+)/without WRS (WRS-) working in a single industry and 243 unexposed controls from Ajou Medical Center (Suwon, South Korea). Levels of epithelial cell-derived cytokines (interleukin [IL-8], transforming growth factor-β1 [TGF-β1], eotaxin-) and inflammatory mediators (eosinophil-derived neurotoxins [EDN]) in sera or cell-free supernatants were measured by ELISA. Human airway epithelial cells (HAECs), A549, were stimulated by wheat flour extracts and co-cultured with peripheral blood neutrophils isolated from 4 asthmatic patients.Serum TGF-β1 levels were significantly lower in exposed subjects than in unexposed controls, in the WRS+ group than in the WRS- group ( < 0.001 for each). The WRS+ group had a significantly higher level of serum EDN than the WRS- group ( < 0.001). Serum TGF-β1 and EDN levels predicted the development of WRS in exposed subjects (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.719, 72.4% sensitivity/70% specificity; AUC = 0.759, 78.6% sensitivity/60% specificity). From wheat-stimulated HAECs, TGF-β1 release peaked at 6 hours after wheat exposure, while eotaxin- peaked at 12 hours. Co-culture of HAECs with neutrophils did not affect TGF-β1 release.Our results suggest that TGF-β1 may contribute to develop type- airway inflammation and WRS.

We evaluate a novel system in which patient-nominated lay carers were trained to deliver intramuscular injections to patients in their own homes.A pragmatic, individually randomised non-inferiority trial was conducted at two hospitals in Malawi. Adults starting TB retreatment were recruited. Patients randomised to the intervention received home-based care from patient-nominated lay people trained to deliver intramuscular streptomycin. Patients receiving standard care were admitted to hospital for  months of streptomycin. The primary outcome was successful treatment (alive and on treatment) at the end of the intervention.Of 456 patients screened, 204 participants were randomised. The trial was terminated early due to futility. At the end of the intervention, 97/101 (96.0%) in the hospital arm were still alive and on treatment compared with 96/103 (93.%) in the home-based arm (risk difference -0.03 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.03); p value 0.538). There were no differences in the proportion completing 8 months of anti-TB treatment; or the proportion experiencing -month sputum culture conversion. The mean cost of hospital-based management was US$1546.3 per person, compared to US$729. for home-based management. Home-based care reduced risk of catastrophic household costs by 84%.Although this trial failed to meet target recruitment, the available data demonstrate that training patient-nominated lay people has potential to provide a feasible solution to the operational challenges associated with delivering long-term-injectable drugs to people with recurrent or drug-resistant TB in resource-limited settings, and substantially reduce costs.

This study aims to examine the immune responses induced in pigs following vaccination (live S48 tachyzoites) and/or challenge with T. gondii oocysts, through the examination of changes in levels of transcription in CD4, CD8α, IFN-γ, IL-12p35, CXCR3, MyD88. The experiment involved four groups of animals; pigs in group 1 (Challenged) (Chal) were challenged orally with (1 × 10 oocysts) on day 28 of the experiment. Pigs in group  (Vaccinated /Challenged) (Vac/Chal) were vaccinated (S48 isolate tachyzoites) on day 0, then challenged on day 28. The group 3 (Vaccinated) (Vac) animals were vaccinated (S48 isolate tachyzoites) on day 0 of the experiment. Finally the group 4 (control) pigs remained non-vaccinated and non-challenged. All animals were culled 6 weeks post challenge. At post mortem samples of retropharyngeal lymph node (RLN), mesenteric LN (MLN) and spleen were collected, RNA was extracted and cDNA synthesised. The results showed significant increases in IFN-γ expression in samples from groups 1 (Chal) and  (Vac/Chal) (RLN) and groups 1,  and 3 (Vac) (spleen) and in MyD88 expression (RLN) in samples from groups 1,  and 3 compared to the group 4 (control) animals. Significant increases were also observed in CD8α expression in group 1 (Chal) (RLN) and groups 1 and  (Vac/Chal) (RLN and MLN) compared against group 4 (control) and group 3 (Vac) respectively. Conversely, significant down regulation of CD4 and/or IL-12p35 transcription was found in at least one sample from groups 1 (Chal),  (Vac/Chal) and 3 (Vac) compared to group 4 (control) pigs. This study demonstrates that cell mediated and innate immune responses are generated in pigs following exposure to T. gondii parasites (oocysts or tachyzoites), key amongst them appear to be IFN-γ, MyD88 and CD8α.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A natural medicine, mangiferin has exhibited modulatory effect on TLR2 signaling and anti-inflammatory effects on different diseases. The objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of mangiferin on peri-implantitis and the potential mechanisms by administering this drug to an experimental peri-implantitis mouse model.Maxillary left first, second, and third molars of mice were extracted, and dental implants were placed in the region of the maxillary left second molars. Then, peri-implantitis was induced by tying ligatures around implants, and mangiferin was given orally to the mice. After 6-week mangiferin treatment, bone loss around the implants was detected using micro-computerized tomography (micro-CT). Alveolar bone and inflammatory infiltrate in peri-implant tissues were examined using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Production of interleukin-6 (IL6), a TLR2 downstream proinflammatory cytokine, in the tissue surrounding implants was measured using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. IL6 protein expression and TLR2 signaling pathway activation in peri-implant tissues were detected using western blot analysis.Micro-CT demonstrated reduced bone loss in peri-implantitis upon mangiferin administration. Additionally, H&E staining showed more alveolar bone and less inflammatory infiltrate in peri-implant tissues after mangiferin application. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated lower levels of IL6 gene expression, and western blot analysis showed decreased protein expression of IL6 and TLR2, and suppressed phosphorylation of TLR2 downstream nuclear factor-κB, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase after mangiferin treatment.These results suggest the suppressive effect of mangiferin on bone damage and inflammatory infiltrate in peri-implantitis. These therapeutic effects may be associated with inhibited IL6 production and reduced TLR2 signaling activation in peri-implant tissues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666126>Host-range shift of H3N8 canine influenza virus: a phylodynamic analysis of its origin and adaptation from equine to canine host.</a></h1><p>Prior to the emergence of H3N8 canine influenza virus (CIV) and the latest avian-origin H3N2 CIV, there was no evidence of a circulating canine-specific influenza virus. Molecular and epidemiological evidence suggest that H3N8 CIV emerged from H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV). This host-range shift of EIV from equine to canine hosts and its subsequent establishment as an enzootic CIV is unique because this host-range shift was from one mammalian host to another. To further understand this host-range shift, we conducted a comprehensive phylodynamic analysis using all the available whole-genome sequences of H3N8 CIV. We found that (1) the emergence of H3N8 CIV from H3N8 EIV occurred in approximately 2002; () this interspecies transmission was by a reassortant virus of the circulating Florida-1 clade H3N8 EIV; (3) once in the canine species, H3N8 CIV spread efficiently and remained an enzootic virus; (4) H3N8 CIV evolved and diverged into multiple clades or sublineages, with intra and inter-lineage reassortment. Our results provide a framework to understand the molecular basis of host-range shifts of influenza viruses and that dogs are potential "mixing vessels" for the establishment of novel influenza viruses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678495>The novel small-molecule antagonist MMG-11 preferentially inhibits TLR2/1 signaling.</a></h1><p>Toll-like receptor  (TLR2) forms heterodimers with either TLR1 or TLR6 to induce protective early inflammatory responses to pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns. However, excessive activation is associated with inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Several TLR2 antagonists have been described but pharmacological characterization is still at an early stage. Previously, we identified the potent and selective TLR2 antagonist MMG-11 by computational modelling and experimental validation.Here, we characterized the TLR2 antagonists MMG-11 and CU-CPT22 as well as the TIR-domain binding TLR2 antagonist C29 in TLR-overexpressing promoter cells as well as human and mouse macrophages. In line with our recent studies, MMG-11 abrogated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and NF-κB activation induced by different bacterial TLR2 agonists. MMG-11 preferentially inhibited TLR2/1 signaling in promoter cells stably expressing TLR2 heterodimers and mouse macrophages. Furthermore, the TLR2 antagonist blocked ligand-induced interaction of TLR2 with MyD88 and reduced MAP kinase and NF-κB activation. MMG-11 and CU-CPT22 but not C29 displaced PamCSK in an indirect binding assay confirming the competitive mode of action of MMG-11 and CU-CPT22. Isobologram analysis revealed additive and synergistic effects when the non-competitive antagonist C29 was combined with the competitive antagonist MMG-11 or CU-CPT22, respectively. In conclusion, we provide evidence that MMG-11 acts as a competitive antagonist with a predominance for the TLR2/1 heterodimer in human and mouse cells. Our results also indicate that MMG-11 is a model compound for studying TLR2 signaling.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Whereas CRISPR loci evolve rapidly in natural environments, bacterial species typically evolve phage resistance by the mutation or loss of phage receptors under laboratory conditions. Here we report how this discrepancy may in part be explained by differences in the biotic complexity of in vitro and natural environments. Specifically, by using the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its phage DMS3vir, we show that coexistence with other human pathogens amplifies the fitness trade-offs associated with the mutation of phage receptors, and therefore tips the balance in favour of the evolution of CRISPR-based resistance. We also demonstrate that this has important knock-on effects for the virulence of P. aeruginosa, which became attenuated only if the bacteria evolved surface-based resistance. Our data reveal that the biotic complexity of microbial communities in natural environments is an important driver of the evolution of CRISPR-Cas adaptive , with key implications for bacterial fitness and virulence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665638>Mitochondrial Damage Causes Inflammation via cGAS-STING Signaling in Acute Kidney Injury.</a></h1><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of the innate immune system. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway detects cytosolic DNA and induces innate . Here, we investigate the role of mitochondrial damage and subsequent activation of the cGAS-STING pathway using a genetically engineered animal model of cisplatin-induced AKI and cultured tubular cells. Cisplatin induced mtDNA leakage into the cytosol-probably through BCL--like protein 4 (BAX) pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane-in tubules, with subsequent activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby triggering inflammation and AKI progression, which is improved in STING-deficient mice. STING knockdown in cultured tubular cells ameliorates inflammatory responses induced by cisplatin. mtDNA depletion and repletion studies support tubular inflammatory responses via the cGAS-STING signal activation by cytosolic mtDNA. Therefore, we conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent activation of the mtDNA-cGAS-STING pathway is a critical regulator of kidney injury.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.
