In Experiment I, rumen microbial population and fermentation profiles were evaluated on 16 fistulated male goats that were randomly assigned to four treatment groups: i) control (CNT), ii) olive oil (OL), iii) palm olein oil (PO), and iv) sunflower oil (SF). In Experiment II, another group of 16 male goats was randomly assigned to the same dietary treatments for digestibility determination.Rumen ammonia concentration was higher in CNT group compared to treatment groups receiving dietary oils. The total VFA and  concentration were higher in SF and OL groups, which showed that they were significantly affected by the dietary treatments. There were no differences in total microbial population. However, fibre degrading bacteria populations were affected by the interaction between treatment and day of sampling. Significant differences were observed in apparent digestibility of crude protein and ether extract of treatment groups containing dietary oils compared to the control group.This study demonstrated that supplementation of different dietary oils containing different fatty acid profiles improved rumen fermentation by reducing ammonia concentration and increasing total VFA concentration, altering fibre degrading bacteria population, and improving apparent digestibility of crude protein and ether extract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30496969>The enhancement of iron fuel cell on bio-cathode denitrification and its mechanism as well as the microbial community analysis of bio-cathode.</a></h2><p>To address the issue of insufficient electrons during denitrification, an iron fuel cell (IFC) bioreactor using iron as abiotic anode was designed. The nitrogen removal efficiency (NRE) of IFC (2.54 ± 0.016%) was significantly lower than microbial fuel cell (MFC) (32.58 ± 0.033%) with same bio-cathode under autotrophic conditions, which was due to the permeation of  on proton exchange membrane (PEM) affected the process of enriching autotrophic denitrifying bacteria by MFC. When used in heterotrophic conditions, the NRE of the closed-circuits of IFC was 29.04%, 10.53%, 8.33% higher than open-circuits, respectively, when the COD/nitrogen (C/N) ratios was 1, 2 and 3. The enhancement of IFC was the iron anode could convert a portion of nitrate to nitrite according to the abiotic cathode control experiments. The mainly functional bacteria of bio-cathode was Paracoccus (53.04%).

The fermentation broth was made by a chemostat system using the cecal content from a donor chicken as the source of inoculum. A total of 120 newly hatched broiler chicks were randomly divided into two groups. One group (F group) was orally inoculated with the fermentation broth, and the other (C group) was treated with an equal amount of sterile PBS solution. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to investigate the differences in the cecal  of the broiler chickens between the two groups on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Moreover, the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the cecal contents were analyzed by gas chromatography. The results showed that the abundances of genera  and  decreased sharply in the F group on days 1 and 3 by the early intervention with cecal fermentation broth. In contrast, the relative abundance of the genus  on days 1, 3, and 7, and the family Ruminococcaceae on days 1, 3, and 28 increased in the F group, respectively. In terms of SCFAs, the concentrations of  on day 28, propionic acid on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28, butyrate on day 1, and isovalerate on day 14 were significantly higher in the F group compared with the C group. Overall, these results suggest that early intervention with cecal fermentation broth could have beneficial effects on broilers gut health, which might be attributed to the alterations in the gut microbial composition and the increased concentrations of SCFAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523960>Impact of a Plant Sterol- and Galactooligosaccharide-Enriched Beverage on Colonic Metabolism and Gut  Composition Using an  Dynamic Model.</a></h2><p>A beverage enriched with plant sterols (1 g/100 mL) and galactooligosaccharides (1.8 g/100 mL) was subjected to a dynamic gastrointestinal and colonic fermentation process to evaluate the effect on sterol metabolism, organic acid production, and  composition. Production of sterol metabolites (coprostanol, methylcoprostanol, ethylcoprostenol, ethylcoprostanol, and sitostenone) was observed in the transverse colon (TC) and descending colon (DC) vessels in general, from 24 and 48 h, respectively. Microbial activity was assessed through the production of organic acids, mainly  in all colon vessels, lactate in the AC, and butyrate and propionate in the TC and DC. A higher diversity in the microbial community was found in the TC and DC, in accordance with a higher sterol metabolism and organic acid production. Although the prebiotic effect of galactooligosaccharides was not detected, changes in  composition (an increase in the  genus and the Synergistaceae and Lachnospiraceae families) indicated an enhancement of sterol metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981485>Assessment of rumen bacteria in dairy cows with varied milk protein yield.</a></h2><p>The present study was conducted to assess rumen bacteria in lactating cows with different milk protein yield, aiming to understand the role of rumen bacteria in this trait. Cows with high milk protein yield (high milk yield and high milk protein content, HH; n = 20) and low milk protein yield (low milk yield and low milk protein content, LL; n = 20) were selected from 374 mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows fed a high-grain diet. Measurement of the rumen fermentation products showed that the concentrations of ruminal total volatile fatty acids, propionate, butyrate, and valerate and the proportion of isobutyrate were higher in the HH cows than in the LL cows. Amplicon sequencing analysis of the rumen bacterial community revealed that the richness (Chao 1 index) of rumen  was higher in the LL cows than in the HH cows. Among the 10 predominant bacterial phyla (relative abundance being >0.10%, present in >60% of animals within each group), the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was 1.36-fold higher in the HH cows than in the LL cows. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Succinivibrio was significantly higher and that of Clostridium tended to be higher in the LL cows than in the HH cows. Sharpea was 2.28-fold enriched in the HH cows compared with the LL cows. Different relationships between the relative abundances of rumen microbial taxa and volatile fatty acid concentrations were observed in the HH and the LL animals, respectively. Succinivibrio and Prevotella were positively correlated with , propionate, and valerate in the LL cows, whereas Sharpea was positively correlated with propionate and valerate concentrations in the HH cows. Collectively, our results revealed that rumen bacterial richness and the relative abundances of several bacterial taxa significantly differed between dairy cows with high and low milk protein yields, suggesting the potential roles of rumen  contributing to milk protein yield in dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Here  (, ) combined with corn bran ( + Bran) was taken as the synbiotics application in a waned pig model to investigate its regulation of intestinal health over 28 days postweaning. Growth performance, fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bacterial community were evaluated at day 14 and day 28 of the trial. Although the  + Bran treatment has no significant effects on growth performance ( > 0.05), it optimized the composition of intestinal bacteria, mainly represented by increased -producing bacteria and decreased pathogens. Microbial fermentation in the intestine showed a shift from low  and isovalerate production on day 14 to enhanced  production on day 28 in the  + Bran treatment. Thus,  and corn bran promoted intestinal microbial fermentation and optimized the microbial community for pigs at an early age. These findings provide perspectives on the advantages of synbiotics as a new approach for effective utilization of corn barn.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760672>Effect of Oat and Tartary Buckwheat - Based Food on Cholesterol - Lowering and Gut  in Hypercholesterolemic Hamsters.</a></h2><p>The nutritional components in oat and tartary buckwheat had been assessed to have cholesterollowering effects. However, The effect of oat and tartary buckwheat based-food (OF) on cholesterol-lowering and gut  in hypercholesterole hamsters was still limited studied because they are usually consumed in whole gran as well as after being processed. In this study, normal diets, high fat diet (HFD) with/without OF were fed to hamsters for 30 days respectively and growth parameters, metabolic parameters, and gut  were investigated, respectively. It was found that OF significantly decreased plasma total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol), lowered liver TC, cholesterol ester (CE), and triglycerides (TG) concentrations, and increased fecal weight and bile acids (BA) concentrations, compared with HFD (p < 0.05). Moreover, the concentrations of , propionate, butyrate and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were significantly increased in hamsters fed with OF, compared with HFD (p < 0.05). OF changed the overall structure of gut . The relative abundances of Erysipelotrichaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae were decreased and the relative abundance of Eubacteriaceae was increased, compared with HFD. These results suggested that OF could reduce the concentrations of plasma lipid by inhibiting cholesterol absorption in liver and promoting excretions of fecal lipid and BA. And it also increased SCFAs and modulated the gut  effectively to exert the hypocholesterolemic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616396>SCFAs-Induced GLP-1 Secretion Links the Regulation of Gut Microbiome on Hepatic Lipogenesis in Chickens.</a></h2><p>The impact of gut  and its metabolites on fat metabolism have been widely reported in human and animals. However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that liver is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut  and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal  diversity, altered short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut  on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176177>A conceptual method to simultaneously inhibit methane and hydrogen sulfide production in sewers: The carbon metabolic pathway and microbial community shift.</a></h2><p>In this study, the impact of COD/SO ratio in sewage on methane and hydrogen sulfide production in sewer biofilms was investigated by using three identical lab-scale gravity sewer systems. The results showed that the COD/SO played a key role in the competition between methanogenic archaea (MA) and sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). Both the lowest methane and hydrogen sulfide production were obtained at COD/SO ratio of 6. The carbon transformation revealed that the activity of both MA and SRB was inhibited at this COD/SO ratio. Methanosarcina and Methanobacterium were the two dominant MA, while Desulfonema, Desulfotomaculum and Desulfovibrio were the dominant SRB in this case. The specific SRB activity measured by batch tests proved that  was mainly degraded by the MA, while propionate was the preferred substrate for the SRB.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a well-established model of progressive MS triggered by intracranial infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), we sought to determine whether dysbiosis induced by oral antibiotics (ABX) administered on pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases of the disease influences its course. We also addressed the effects of  recolonization after ABX withdrawn in the presence or absence of probiotics. Central and peripheral immunity, plasma  and butyrate levels, axon damage and motor disability were evaluated. The cocktail of ABX prevented motor dysfunction and limited axon damage in mice, which had fewer CD4 and CD8 T cells in the CNS, while gut  recolonization worsened motor function and axonal integrity. The underlying mechanisms of ABX protective effects seem to involve CD4CD39 T cells and CD5CD1d B cells into the CNS. In addition, microglia adopted a round amoeboid morphology associated to an anti-inflammatory gene profile in the spinal cord of TMEV mice administered ABX. The immune changes in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were modest, yet ABX treatment of mice limited IL-17 production . Collectively, our results provide evidence of the functional relevance of gut  manipulation on the neurodegenerative state and disease severity in a model of progressive MS and reinforce the role of gut  as target for MS treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108132>Gut dysbiosis and lack of short chain fatty acids in a Chinese cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Recent studies, mostly conducted in Western countries, showed that gut microbes are involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS).The aim of this study was to investigate whether gut dysbiosis is relevant to the initiation and progression of MS in a Chinese population.Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and gas chromatography (GC) were integrated and used to compare the fecal bacterial communities and the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels among relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients (n = 34), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) patients (n = 34), and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 34). T-cell profile analyses were performed by flow cytometry for MS patients and matched controls (n = 12).(1) The gut microbiome of MS patients was characterized by an increase of Streptococcus and a decrease of Prevotella_9; additionally, compared to NMOSD patients, Prevotella_9 was found to be much more abundant in MS patients. (2) A striking depletion of fecal , propionate, and butyrate was observed in MS patients compared to HCs. (3) The abundance of Streptococcus was negatively correlated with the proportion of pTregs (P < 0.05) and positively correlated with Th17 cells (P < 0.05) in the peripheral blood, while the abundance of Prevotella_9 was negatively correlated with the Th17 cell frequency (P < 0.01), and the fecal SCFA level was positively correlated with pTreg frequency (P < 0.05).Gut dysbiosis and a lack of SCFAs exist in Chinese MS patients, which might be related to an aberrant immune response of MS; this relationship may have a diagnostic and therapeutic value for patients with MS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was aimed to investigate the changes of intestinal  and barrier function in burned mice to further comprehend the mechanisms of burn-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction.Samples were from mice inflicted with 30% total body surface area (TBSA) full-thickness burns. The intestinal permeability, tight junction proteins expressions, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) localization, inflammatory cytokines expressions, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents were determined. The microbial community was assessed via 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing.The intestinal permeability was increased after severe burn injury, peaking at 6 h post-burn, with approximately 20-folds of the control ( < 0.001). The expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-2) was significantly altered ( < 0.05). The ZO-1 morphology was dramatically changed following burn injury. The fecal SCFAs' contents (, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were noticeably declined after burn injury ( < 0.05). The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6) in ileal mucosa were increased, whereas the expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) were decreased following burn injury ( < 0.05). In addition, burned mice showed an alteration of intestinal microbial community, such as decreased diversity, reduced  abundance, and increased  abundance.The severe burn-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction is along with the alterations of microbial community.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314548>Heart failure developed after myocardial infarction does not affect gut  composition in the rat.</a></h2><p>There is a body of evidence that supports the notion that gut dysbiosis plays a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Decreased cardiac function can reduce intestinal perfusion, resulting in morphological alterations, which may contribute to changes in the gut  composition in patients with heart failure (HF). In this regard, a germane question is whether changes in gut  composition are a cause or consequence of the cardiovascular disturbance. We tested the hypothesis that the development of HF, after myocardial infarction, would cause gut dysbiosis. Fecal samples were collected before and 6 wk after myocardial infarction or sham surgery. Gut  were characterized by sequencing the bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA. The composition of bacterial communities in the fecal samples was evaluated by calculating three major ecological parameters: ) the Chao 1 richness, ) the Pielou evenness, and ) the Shannon index. None of these indices was changed in either sham or HF rats. The  ratio was not altered in HF rats. The number of species in each phylum was also not different between sham and HF rats. β-Diversity analysis showed that the composition of gut  was not changed with the development of HF. Bacterial genera were grouped according to their major metabolic end-products (, butyrate, and lactate), but no differences were observed in HF rats. Therefore, we conclude that HF induced by myocardial infarction does not affect gut  composition, at least in rats, indicating that the dysbiosis observed in patients with HF may precede cardiovascular disturbance. Our study demonstrated that, following myocardial infarction in rats, heart failure (HF) development did not affect the intestinal  despite distinct differences reported in the gut  of humans with HF. Our finding is consistent with the notion that dysbiosis observed in patients with HF may precede cardiovascular dysfunction and therefore offers potential for early diagnosis and treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669509>The Effect of Psyllium Husk on Intestinal  in Constipated Patients and Healthy Controls.</a></h2><p>Psyllium is a widely used treatment for constipation. It traps water in the intestine increasing stool water, easing defaecation and altering the colonic environment.

We performed two randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trials comparing 7 days of psyllium with a placebo (maltodextrin) in 8 healthy volunteers and 16 constipated patients respectively. We measured the patients' gastrointestnal (GI) transit, faecal water content, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and the stool  composition. While psyllium supplement had a small but significant effect on the microbial composition of healthy adults (increasing  and decreasing ), in constipated subjects there were greater effects on the microbial composition (increased , , ,  and  and decreased uncultured  and ) and alterations in the levels of  and propionate. We found several taxa to be associated with altered GI transit, SCFAs and faecal water content in these patients. Significant increases in three genera known to produce butyrate, ,  and , correlated with increased faecal water. In summary, psyllium supplementation increased stool water and this was associated with significant changes in , most marked in constipated patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30778376>Higher Risk of Stroke Is Correlated With Increased Opportunistic Pathogen Load and Reduced Levels of Butyrate-Producing Bacteria in the Gut.</a></h2><p> Gut  is a newly identified risk factor for stroke, and there are no large prospective studies linking the baseline gut microbiome to long-term risk of stroke. We present here the correlation between the gut  and stroke risk in people with no prior stroke history.  A total of 141 participants aged ≥60 years without prior history of stroke were recruited and divided into low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk groups based on known risk factors and whether they were suffering from chronic diseases. The composition of their gut microbiomes was compared using 16S rRNA gene amplicon next-generation-sequencing and Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) analysis. Levels of fecal short-chain fatty acids were measured using gas chromatography.  We found that opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae and Veillonellaceae) and lactate-producing bacteria (e.g.,  and ) were enriched, while butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g., Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae) were depleted, in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group. Butyrate concentrations were also lower in the fecal samples obtained from the high-risk group than from the low-risk group. The concentrations of other short-chain fatty acids (e.g., , propionate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, and valerate) in the gut were comparable among the three groups.  Participants at high risk of stroke were characterized by the enrichment of opportunistic pathogens, low abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, and reduced concentrations of fecal butyrate.

Thus, the effect of raw potato starch (RPS), a widely adopted RS material, on microbial composition and barrier function of cecum for meat ducks was determined. Cherry Valley male ducks, 360,1-day-old, were randomly divided and fed diets with 0% (control), 12%, or 24% RPS for 35 d. Diets Supplemented with RPS significantly elevated villus height and villus height: crypt depth ratio in the cecum. The 16S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that the diet with 12% RPS had a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and the butyrate-producing bacteria Faecalibacterium, Subdoligranulum, and Erysipelatoclostridium were enriched among all diets. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were significantly increased in the 24% RPS diet vs. the control diet. When compared with the control diet, the diet with 12% RPS also was found to notably increase , propionate and butyrate contents, and up-regulated barrier-related genes including Claudin-1, Zonula occludens (ZO)-1, mucin-2, and proglucagon of cecum. Furthermore, addition of 12% RPS significantly reduced plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and endotoxin concentrations.

This review summarizes recent research results for dysregulated glucose metabolism of SCFAs, which could be initiated by gut microbiome of CRC. Moreover, the relationship between SCFA transporters and glycolysis, which may correlate with the initiation and progression of CRC, are also discussed. Additionally, this review explores the linkage of BT to transport of SCFAs expressions between normal and cancerous colonocyte cell growth for tumorigenesis inhibition in CRC. Furthermore, the link between gut  and SCFAs in the metabolism of CRC, in addition, the proteins and genes related to SCFAs-mediated signaling pathways, coupled with their correlation with the initiation and progression of CRC are also discussed. Therefore, targeting the SCFA transporters to regulate lactate generation and export of BT, as well as applying SCFAs or gut  and natural compounds for chemoprevention may be clinically useful for CRCs treatment. Future research should focus on the combination these therapeutic agents with metabolic inhibitors to effectively target the tumor SCFAs and regulate the bacterial ecology for activation of potent anticancer effect, which may provide more effective application prospect for CRC therapy.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106108>High-fat diet reduces the level of secretory immunoglobulin A coating of commensal gut .</a></h2><p>Excessive fat intake is associated with changes in gut  composition. In the present study, we focused on the secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) coating of gut  as a mucosal immune response affecting the gut  following a high-fat diet (HFD). The level of SIgA coating of gut  was evaluated in normal-fat diet (NFD)- and HFD-fed mice. HFD significantly decreased the level of SIgA coating the gut  compared with NFD. Of note, substitution of HFD with NFD resulted in a complete recovery of the level of SIgA coating. These findings suggest that dietary fat influences the SIgA coating of the gut . Furthermore, we analyzed the composition of the gut  and the concentration of cecal short-chain fatty acids. HFD feeding changed the gut  composition at the phylum and family levels. Pearson correlation analysis between the level of SIgA coating of gut  and the relative abundance of gut  showed that the relative abundances of , , , and  were negatively correlated with the level of SIgA coating of gut . Conversely, the relative abundances of , S24-7, and  were positively correlated with the level of SIgA coating. The concentrations of cecal  and butyrate were lower in HFD-fed mice and positively correlated with the level of SIgA coating of gut . Our observations suggest that a decrease in the level of SIgA coating of the gut  through a HFD might relate to HFD-induced changes in microbial composition and microbial metabolites production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30650566>Effect of β-Glucan and Black Tea in a Functional Bread on Short Chain Fatty Acid Production by the Gut  in a Gut Digestion/Fermentation Model.</a></h2><p>β-Glucan and black tea are fermented by the colonic  producing short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and phenolic acids (PA). We hypothesized that the addition of β-glucan, a dietary fiber, and tea polyphenols to a food matrix like bread will also affect starch digestion in the upper gut and thus further influence colonic fermentation and SCFA production. This study investigated SCFA and PA production from locally developed breads: white bread (WB), black tea bread (BT), β-glucan bread (βG), β-glucan plus black tea bread (βGBT). Each bread was incubated in an in vitro system mimicking human digestion and colonic fermentation. Digestion with α-amylase significantly ( = 0.0001) increased total polyphenol and polyphenolic metabolites from BT bread compared with WB, βG, and βGBT. Total polyphenols in βGBT remained higher ( = 0.016; 1.3-fold) after digestion with pepsin and pancreatin compared with WB. Fermentations containing βG and βGBT produced similar propionate concentrations ranging from 17.5 to 18.6 mmol/L and total SCFA from 46.0 to 48.9 mmol/L compared with control WB (14.0 and 37.4 mmol/L, respectively). This study suggests that combination of black tea with β-glucan in this functional bread did not impact on SCFA production. A higher dose of black tea and β-glucan or in combination with other fibers may be needed to increase SCFA production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30710817>Meta-omics based analyses of microbiome involved in biomethanation of rice straw in a thermophilic anaerobic bioreactor under optimized conditions.</a></h2><p>Biomethanation of rice straw was performed at 55 °C without thermochemical pretreatment using cattle dung supplemented with Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus strains. Methane yield of 323 ml g VS obtained under optimized conditions such as particle size (1 mm), carbon to nitrogen ratio (15:1), substrate to inoculum ratio (1:1), organic loading rate (7.5% w/v) and hydraulic retention time (20 days), was one of the highest ever reported from rice straw. Metagenome analysis revealed several putative novel taxa among resident microbes. The genomes of Clostridium, Hungateiclostridium, Alkaliphilus, Anaerocolumna, Olsenella, Paenibacillus, Pseudoclostridium, Tepidanaerobacter and Turicibacter were recovered as metagenome assisted genomes. Clostridium spp. and M. thermautotrophicus were the dominant hydrolytic and methanogenic microbes, respectively. Syntrophic  oxidation coupled to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was found to be the major pathway for methane production.

The influence of thermal treatment (90 °C) on the inhibition of the methanogenic archaea and enriching the acetogenic bacteria in different inocula (mesophilic and thermophilic) was initially tested. The most efficient inoculum that achieved the highest performance through the fermentation process was further used to define the optimum H/CO gas ratio that secures maximum production yield of chemicals and maximum biogas upgrading efficiency. In addition, 16S rRNA analysis of the microbial community was conducted at the end of the experimental period to target functional microbes. The maximum biogas content (77% (v/v)) and  yield (72%) were achieved for 2H:1CO ratio (v/v), with Moorella sp. 4 as the most dominant thermophilic acetogenic bacterium.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Cupei is the mixture of fermented materials and vinegar is the liquid leached from Cupei. The characteristics of microbial community were revealed by Illumina-MiSeq. The result suggested that inoculation of M. purpureus decreased the microbial diversities and inhibited several pathogens related microbes including Erwinia, Proteus and Ignatzschineria of Cupei. The dominant genera of SBV were Lactobacillus, Acetobacter, Trichoderma and Candida. With addition of M. purpureus, the total relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Acetobacter was increased from 75.14% to 99.79%. Furthermore, the major metabolites in corresponding vinegar were investigated by HPLC and HS-SPME-GC-MS. The result indicated that the addition of M. purpureus significantly promoted the accumulation of organic acids, aromatic esters and alcohols, whose contents were increased by 1.95, 2.30 and 3.55 times, respectively. Meanwhile acetic acid, lactic acid, phenethyl  and β-phenethyl alcohol were the dominant components in organic acids, esters and alcohols, respectively. In addition, the relationship between dominant microbes and major metabolites explored by redundancy analysis displayed that Lactobacillus, Acetobacter, Candida and Monascus were closely related with seven volatiles and five organic acids.

Gilts were housed in individual stalls. In the SPV treatment, 2 kg fresh sweet potato vine was used instead of 0.18 kg basal diet which provided the same amount of digestive energy and crude protein with the exception of crude fiber (CON, 51.00 g/d vs. SPV, 73.94 g/d) in terms of dry matter intake. Gilts were slaughtered and samples were collected on day 19 after the third estrus cycle. The SPV treatment tended to increase slaughter weight of gilts ( = 0.07); it also increased ( < 0.05) gastrointestinal tract weight and intestinal muscle layer thickness. SPV treatment also decreased ( < 0.05) carcass yield and subcutaneous adipose tissue. The concentration of zonulin and endotoxin in plasma was decreased ( < 0.05) as the gilt consumed the SPV diet.

Xiexin Tang (XXT), a compound recipe composed of Dahuang (Rheum palmatum L.), Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) and Huanglian (Coptis chinensis Franch.), has been reported to have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, but its mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study found that Xiexin Tang markedly ameliorated the composition of the gut , especially for some short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing bacteria, and then notably increased SCFAs production. However, the mechanism of XXT on the fermentation of gut bacteria and further improvement of obesity is not yet clear.This study aimed to unravel the molecular mechanism of XXT on the amelioration of obesity.Here, high-fat diet-induced obese rat model was established to investigate the intervention efficacy following oral administration of XXT. Additionally, the expressions of key enzymes of gut microbe-derived SCFAs biosynthesis and key targets in the signaling pathway of energy metabolism were investigated by ELISA and qPCR analysis.Results showed that XXT could notably correct lipid metabolism disorders, alleviate systematic inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation. Additionally, XXT could increase gut -derived SCFAs-producing capacity by enhancing mRNA levels and activities of SCFA-synthetic key enzymes such as  kinase (ACK), methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MMD), butyryl-CoA:  CoA transferase (BUT) and butyrate kinase (BUK), which markedly decreased the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents, elevated adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and further lowered the energy charge (EC) in obese rats via activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)/uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) signaling pathway. What's more, XXT could notably ameliorate dyslipidemia via increasing the gene expression of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and blocking mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.Taken together, our data provided a novel insight into the role of XXT in losing weight from energy metabolism regulation, which unraveled the molecular mechanism of XXT on the alleviation of dyslipidemia and fat heterotopic accumulation.

The aim of the study was to assess the anti-microbial effects of two different lavender oils on a mixed  from facial skin. The commercial lavender oil and essential lavender oil from the Crimean Peninsula, whose chemical composition and activity are yet to be published, were used. Both oils were analysed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The composition and properties of studied oils were significantly different. The commercial ETJA lavender oil contained 10% more linalool and linalyl  than the Crimean lavender oil. Both oils also had different effects on the mixed facial skin . The Gram-positive bacilli were more sensitive to ETJA lavender oil, and Gram-negative bacilli were more sensitive to Crimean lavender oil.

However, the close interplay between these three systems presents us with difficulties in deciphering the cause-effect relationship in disease. The present study utilized beta 1 and 2 adrenergic receptor knock out (AdrB1AdrB2/J KO) mice to isolate the effects of reduced overall sympathetic drive on gut  and systemic immune system. We observed the following: (i) Diminished beta adrenergic signaling mainly reflects in shifts in the Firmicutes phyla, with a significant increase in abundance of largely beneficial Bacilli Lactobacillales in the KO mice; (ii) This was associated with increased colonic production of beneficial short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) butyrate,  and propionate, confirming functional  shifts in the KO mice; (iii) Dampened systemic immune responses in the KO mice reflected in reduction on circulating CD4.IL17 T cells and increase in young neutrophils, both previously associated with shifts in the gut . Taken together, these observations demonstrate that reduced expression of beta adrenergic receptors may lead to beneficial shifts in the gut  and dampened systemic immune responses. Considering the role of both in hypertension, this suggests that dietary intervention may be a viable option for manipulation of blood pressure via correcting gut dysbiosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760264>Cell factories converting lactate and  to butyrate: Clostridium butyricum and microbial communities from dark fermentation bioreactors.</a></h2><p>Interactions between microorganisms during specific steps of anaerobic digestion determine metabolic pathways in bioreactors and consequently the efficiency of fermentation processes. This study focuses on conversion of lactate and  to butyrate by bacteria of dark fermentation. The recently recognized flavin-based electron bifurcation as a mode of energy coupling by anaerobes increases our knowledge of anaerobic lactate oxidation and butyrate formation.Microbial communities from dark fermentation bioreactors or pure culture of Clostridium butyricum are able to convert lactate and  to butyrate in batch experiments. The ability of C. butyricum to transform lactate and  to butyrate was shown for the first time, with ethanol identified as an additional end product of this process. A search for genes encoding EtfAB complexes and their gene neighbourhood in C. butyricum and other bacteria capable of lactate and  conversion to butyrate as well as butyrate-producers only and the lactate oxidiser Acetobacterium woodii, revealed that the Etf complexes involved in (i) lactate oxidation and (ii) butyrate synthesis, form separate clusters. There is a more extent similarity between Etf subunits that are involved in lactate oxidation in various species (e.g. A. woodii and C. butyricum) than between the different etf gene products within the same species of butyrate producers. A scheme for the metabolic pathway of lactate and  transformation to butyrate in C. butyricum was constructed.Studies on the conversion of lactate and  to butyrate by microbial communities from dark fermentation bioreactors or Clostridium butyricum suggest that a phenomenon analogous to cross-feeding of lactate in gastrointestinal tract also occurs in hydrogen-yielding reactors. A scheme of lactate and  transformation pathway is proposed, based on the example of C. butyricum, which employs flavin-based electron bifurcation. This process utilizes electron-transferring flavoprotein (Etf) complexes specific for (i) lactate oxidation and (ii) butyrate formation. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that such complexes are encoded in the genomes of other bacteria capable of lactate and  conversion to butyrate.

These metabolites and metabolic pathways were mainly involved in amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, methylamine metabolism, bile acid metabolism and urea cycle, and short-chain fatty acid metabolism. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we found that KYDS was related to eleven different intestinal microbiotas. These gut  were mostly involved in amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. Combined fecal metabonomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we further discovered that KYDS was primarily linked to three gut microbiotas (i.e. Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio and [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group) and eleven related metabolites (i.e. deoxycholate, n-butyrate, valine, isoleucine, , taurine, glycine, α-gluconse, β-glucose, glycerol and tryptophan) mediated various metabolic disorders (amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, especially methylamine metabolism, bile acid metabolism and urea cycle, short-chain fatty acid metabolism. nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism).

In the present study, berberine, a modulator of gut  with substantial anti-RA effect, was chosen to explore the mechanisms by which the  modulators ameliorate RA. The results showed that oral administration of berberine alleviated collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats in a gut -dependent manner. Berberine down-regulated the diversity and richness of the gut bacteria, reduced the abundance of , and elevated the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria in CIA rats as determined by the 16S rRNA gene sequence, which might function through limiting the generation of nitrate and stabilizing the physiologic hypoxia in the intestine. Moreover, berberine treatment significantly increased the intestinal butyrate level and promoted the expression and activity of butyryl-CoA:-CoA transferase (BUT).

The treatments were: control (untreated rice straw, no added corn oil), rice straw pretreated with urea and nitrate (34 and 4.7 g/kg of rice straw on a dry matter [DM] basis, respectively, UN), and UN diet supplemented with corn oil (15 g/kg soybean and 15 g/kg corn were replaced by 30 g/kg corn oil, DM basis, UNCO).Compared with control, UN increased neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility ( < 0.001) and copies of protozoa ( < 0.001) and  ( < 0.05) in the rumen, but decreased N retention (-21.2%,  < 0.001), dissolved hydrogen concentration (-22.8%,  < 0.001), molar proportion of butyrate (-18.2%,  < 0.05), ( + butyrate) to propionate ratio ( < 0.05) and enteric CH emissions (-10.2%,  < 0.05). In comparison with UN, UNCO increased N retention (+34.9%,  < 0.001) and decreased copies of protozoa ( < 0.001) and methanogens ( < 0.001). Compared with control, UNCO increased NDF digestibility (+8.3%,  < 0.001), reduced ruminal dissolved CH concentration (-24.4%,  < 0.001) and enteric CH emissions (-12.6%,  < 0.05).A combination of rice straw pretreated with urea plus nitrate and corn oil supplementation of the diet improved fiber digestibility and lowered enteric CH emissions without negative effects on N retention. These strategies improved the utilization of rice straw by goats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600020>Behaviour of citrus pectin during its gastrointestinal digestion and fermentation in a dynamic simulator (simgi®).</a></h2><p>The behaviour of citrus pectin during digestion and its potential prebiotic properties were examined using a Dynamic Gastrointestinal Simulator (simgi®) model for the human gut, which simulates processes in the stomach, small intestine, ascending, transverse and descending colon. A remarkable non-digestibility of pectin in the upper gastrointestinal tract was observed by HPLC-ELSD analysis, where ∼88% of citrus pectin remained intact during its transit through the stomach and small intestine. Fermentation of pectin stimulated the growth of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium spp, Bacteroides spp and Faecalobacterium prausnitzii. High increases of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were observed, especially in  and butyrate concentration due to direct fermentation of pectin or by cross-feeding interaction between bacteria. This is the first study on the digestibility and fermentation of pectin carried out in a complex dynamic gastrointestinal simulator, being of special relevance the results obtained for F. prausnitzii.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Enterococcal infections, mainly caused by Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, include apical periodontitis, endocarditis, and bloodstream infections. Recently, vancomycinresistant Enterococci are considered major pathogens that are common but difficult to treat, especially in nosocomial settings. Moreover, E. faecalis is closely associated with recurrent endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment. In this study, we investigated the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), , propionate, and butyrate, which are metabolites fermented by gut , on the growth of Enterococci. Enterococci were cultured in the presence or absence of , propionate, or butyrate, and the optical density at 600 nm was measured to determine bacterial growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration test was conducted. Bacteria were treated with a SCFA, together with clinically used endodontic treatment methods such as triple antibiotics (metronidazole, minocycline, and ciprofloxacin) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) to determine the effects of combination treatment. Of the SCFAs, propionate had a bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of E. faecalis in a dose-dependent manner and also that of clinical strains of E. faecalis isolated from dental plaques. Meanwhile,  and butyrate had minimal effects on E. faecalis growth. Moreover, propionate inhibited the growth of other Enterococci including E. faecium. In addition, combination treatment of propionate and triple antibiotics led to further growth inhibition, whereas no cooperative effect was observed at propionate plus CHX. These results indicate that propionate attenuates the growth of Enterococci, suggesting propionate as a potential agent to control Enterococcal infections, especially when combined with triple antibiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691895>Effects of various feedstocks on isotope fractionation of biogas and microbial community structure during anaerobic digestion.</a></h2><p>Feedstock type influences bacterial and methanogenic communities in anaerobic digestion. These two communities work tightly to maintain the stability of anaerobic digestion. How to quick report the changes of microbial community structure especially methanogenesis is the key issue for optimizing anaerobic digestion process. In this study, C isotope fractionations of CH and CO in biogas and microbial community composition were analyzed in 5 different feedstocks. Our results showed that grass silage, maize silage and swine manure fed reactors had similar δ C values and methanogenic community composition, dominated by Methanosarcinaceae. The lowest δ CH values were detected in straw and chicken manure fed reactors, reflecting reduced microbial degradation of material or the presence of toxic components in these feedstocks. The straw fed bioreactor lead to low δ CH values, probably reflecting relatively high levels of the syntrophic  oxidizing bacteria, Synergistaceae and Syntrophaceae, which might work collectively with hydrogenotrophic methanogens, resulting in the low δ CH values in this bioreactor. Significantly, all core microbes in the 5 different feedstock fed bioreactors were either Clostridia species or related to the Synergistaceae (syntrophic  oxidizing bacteria).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The diet plays a pivotal role in maintaining healthy gut  composition and its fermentation leads to production of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) mainly , propionate and butyrate. During pancreatic dysfunction, insulin mediated suppression of glucagon is impaired leading to uncontrolled glucose production by liver and state of hyperglycemia. Insulin and glucagon balance is as important as insulin sensitivity which is reduced during Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP1) produced by Intestinal epithelial cells regulates insulin and glucagon secretion directly via GLP1 receptor on pancreatic cells or via nervous system. But half-life period of GLP1 is very short i.e. about 2 min, after which it is cleaved and inactivated. SCFAs are well documented to induce GLP1 but its direct effect on pancreatic dysfunction has not been reported. This review opens a new avenue to study the role of SCFAs as treatment to pancreatic dysfunction and T2D.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The results showed the highest caproate production achieved 14.9 g/L at the optimal inoculum to substrate ratio (ISR) of 2:1, ethanol to acid ratio (E/A) of 4:1, and pH of 7.5. The caproate yield and selectivity respectively reached 0.62 g/g and 80.8% (as COD). In acidification stage, an appropriate ISR provided a high conversion efficiency and more  formation, which was beneficial to caproate biosynthesis. In caproate production stage, chain elongation performance was sensitive to E/A and pH condition. Butyrate became the main by-product at low E/A or acidic conditions, while excessive ethanol or alkaline condition seriously suppressed substrate conversion. The caproate fermentation was dominated by Clostridium kluyveri. Furthermore, caproate formation was uncoupled with Clostridium kluyveri proliferation, which was mainly generated during the middle and late stages of growth.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Bacterial communities in feces were profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of the V3-V4 region. Fecal SCFA levels were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.NASH patients were characterized by higher abundance of Fusobacteria and Fusobacteriaceae compared to NAFL and HCs. Conforming to our finding that NAFLD patients had higher fecal  and propionate levels, taxonomical differences of fecal bacteria were dominated by SCFA-producing bacteria. Higher fecal propionate and  levels were associated with lower resting regulatory T-cells (rTregs) (CD4+CD45RA+CD25++) as well as higher Th17/rTreg ratio in peripheral blood as immunological characteristics of NASH patients.NASH patients are characterized by a different gut microbiome composition with higher fecal SCFA levels and higher abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria in NAFLD. These changes are associated with immunological features of disease progression.

Probiotics have been shown to exert beneficial health-promoting effects through modulation of intestinal microflora biodiversity, thus the effects of probiotics administration on D-galactose (D-gal) senescence-induced rat were evaluated based on the changes in gut  and metabolomic profiles. Upon senescence induction, the ratio of Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes was significantly lowered, while treatment with Lactobacillus helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 increased the ratio at the phylum level (P < 0.05). Study on the genus level showed that L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 administration reduced Bacteroides, which are prominently opportunistic pathogens while L. fermentum DR9 treated rats promoted the proliferation of Lactobacillus compared to the aged rats (P < 0.05). Probiotics treatment did not alter fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profile, but an increase in  was observed in the D-gal rats. The analysis of fecal water-soluble metabolites showed that D-gal induced senescence caused great impact on amino acids metabolism such as urocanic acid, citrulline, cystamine and 5-oxoproline, which could serve as potential aging biomarkers. Treatment with probiotics ameliorated these metabolites in a strain-specific manner, whereby L. fermentum DR9 promoted antioxidative effect through upregulation of oxoproline, whereas both L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 restored the levels of reducing sugars, arabinose and ribose similar to the young rats. D-gal induced senescence did cause significant immunological alteration in the colon of aged rats however, all probiotic strains demonstrated immunomodulatory properties as L. paracasei OFS 0291, L. helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 alleviated proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-1β as well as IL-4 compared to the aged control (P < 0.05).

To evaluate nitrate denitrification efficiency and culture MAME-D/HYME-D involved bacteria, a leach bed bioreactor semi-continuous experiment was conducted for 60 days in 5 runs, under nitrate concentrations ranging of 20 mg/L-55 mg/L, wherein 5% sterile leachate was added during runs 4 and 5. Although the HYME-D system demonstrated high denitrification efficiency (74.93%) and nitrate removal rate reached 2.62 mmol N/(L⋅d), the MAME-D system exhibited a denitrification efficiency of almost 100% and nitrate removal rate of 4.37 mmol N/(L⋅d). The addition of sterile leachate increased the nitrate removal rate in both systems, but caused the decrease of methane consumption in HYME-D. A stable isotope batch experiment was carried out to investigate the metabolic products by monitoring the CO and NO production. The production of organic intermediates such as citrate, lactic acid, , and propionic acid were also observed, which exhibited a higher yield in HYME-D. Variations in the microbial communities were analyzed during the semi-continuous experiment. MAME-D was mainly conducted by the association of type Ⅰ methanotroph Methylomonas and the methylotrophic denitrifier Methylotenera. Methane fermentation processed by Methylomonas under hypoxic conditions produced more complex organic intermediates and increased the diversity of related heterotrophic denitrifiers. The addition of sterile real leachate, resulting in increase of COD/N, influenced the microbial community of HYME-D system significantly.Copyright © 2019.

Forty-eight Chinese Holstein male dairy calves at 60 ± 3.2 d of age and 89 ± 5.9 kg body weight (mean ± standard error) were assigned to one of four groups in a randomised block design. Calves in control group were fed basal diet, calves in low FA, medium FA and high FA groups with 3.6, 7.2 and 10.8 mg FA per kg basal diet, respectively. The dietary corn silage to concentrate ratio was 50:50 (dry matter [DM] basis). DM intake and average daily gain (ADG) quadratically increased, and feed conversion ratio quadratically decreased with increasing FA supplementation. Ruminal pH linearly decreased, whereas total volatile fatty acids quadratically increased. The unchanged -to-propionate ratio was due to the similar change in  and propionate concentration. Ammonia N content quadratically decreased. Digestibility of DM, organic matter, crude protein, ether extract, neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre linearly increased. Activities of carboxymethyl cellulase, cellobiase, xylanase and pectinase linearly increased, but -amylase and protease quadratically increased. Abundance of  and  linearly increased, but  and  quadratically increased. Urinary total PD excretion quadratically increased.

Previous studies have shown that starter feeding can effectively facilitate the growth and development of the rumen in ruminants. However, the mechanism through which starter feeding stimulates the development of the rumen is not clear. Here, we performed an integrated analysis in ruminal  and a host transcriptomic profile in a lamb model with the intervention of starter feed to understand the ruminal microbiome-host crosstalk in stimulating the development of the ruminal epithelium.Decreased ruminal pH and increased  and butyrate concentrations in the rumen, followed by increasing rumen organ index, were observed in lambs supplemented with starter. Using metagenome sequencing in combination with 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the results showed the abundance of -producing Mitsuokella spp., lactate-producing Sharpea spp., lactate-utilizing Megasphaera spp., and Entodinium spp. was enriched in rumen microbial communities in the starter-feed group. The abundances of genes involved in sugar degradation were decreased in starter-feed lambs, but the GH13 encoding α-amylase was obviously increased. Rumen epithelial transcriptome analysis revealed that seven differentially expressed genes, including MAPK1, PIK3CB, TNFSF10, ITGA6, SNAI2, SAV1, and DLG, related to the cell growth module were upregulated, and BAD's promotion of cell death was downregulated. Correlation analysis revealed that the increase in the concentrations of  and butyrate significantly correlated with the expression of these genes, which indicates  and butyrate likely acted as important drivers in the ruminal microbiome-host crosstalk.The present study comprehensively describes the symbiotic relationship between the rumen  and the host in lambs after starter feeding. Our data demonstrates that the microbiome-driven generation of  and butyrate mediated the growth-related genes' regulation of the growth-associated signalling pathway in the ruminal epithelium.

However, there are studies as how altering forage type influences ruminal fermentation parameters and animal growth performance, and interact with  in meat goats. Our objective for current study was to examine whether the comparative abundance of the Bacteroidetes (B) and Firmicutes (F) bacterial phyla in meat goats fed simple and mixed forages influenced average daily gain (ADG) and rumen fermentation parameters. In the present study, a molecular approach, bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) was applied to accomplish diversity analyses of rumen bacterial populations. Thirty-six Kiko-cross growing meat goats (body weight (BW) = 27.7 ± 2.83 kg) at approximately 7 mo of age were used in this study. Animals were randomly allocated to 3 pasture treatment groups (n = 12) as follows: 1) bermudagrass pasture (BG; Cynodon dactylon), 2) sunn hemp forage (SH; Crotalaria juncea), and 3) BG + SH forage combinations. There were 2 replicates per treatment and animals grazed these pastures for 45 d. Results indicated that treatments had similar initial BW, but final BW and ADG were higher (P < 0.01) for SH and BG + SH combinations than for BG alone. Animal ADG and rumen fermentation ( to propionate; A/P ratios) were highly correlated with the abundance of various bacterial populations within the rumen microbiome. There were linear decreases in percentage of Bacteroidetes (R2 = -0.84; P < 0.05) associated with decreasing ADG. In contrast, increased ADG was linearly associated with higher percentages of Firmicutes (R2 = 0.79; P < 0.05), F/B ratios (R2 = 0.88; P = 0.07), total VFA (R2 = 0.45; P < 0.05), and lower A/P ratio (R2 = -0.72; P < 0.01). This suggests that the substrates (diets) and bacterial community have the role in adapting host biological parameters in meat goats. The abundance examination of both Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes will be useful for exploring the structure of gut  as an estimate of animal performance.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007075>Differences in Fecal Gut , Short-Chain Fatty Acids and Bile Acids Link Colorectal Cancer Risk to Dietary Changes Associated with Urbanization Among Zimbabweans.</a></h2><p>The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is gradually rising in sub-Saharan Africa.

A plant-based diet appears to be beneficial for human health by promoting the development of more diverse and stable microbial systems. Additionally, vegans and vegetarians have significantly higher counts of certain -related operational taxonomic units compared to omnivores. Fibers (that is, non-digestible carbohydrates, found exclusively in plants) most consistently increase lactic acid bacteria, such as , and , and reduce  and  species. Polyphenols, also abundant in plant foods, increase  and , which provide anti-pathogenic and anti-inflammatory effects and cardiovascular protection. High fiber intake also encourages the growth of species that ferment fiber into metabolites as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including , propionate, and butyrate. The positive health effects of SCFAs are myriad, including improved immunity against pathogens, blood-brain barrier integrity, provision of energy substrates, and regulation of critical functions of the intestine. In conclusion, the available literature suggests that a vegetarian/vegan diet is effective in promoting a diverse ecosystem of beneficial bacteria to support both human gut microbiome and overall health.

However, little is known about their influences on intestinal bacterial communities. Here, we described a response in intestinal microbiome to CGA using a porcine model. Twenty-four weaned pigs were allotted to two groups and fed with a basal diet or a basal diet containing 1000 mg/kg CGA. Results showed that CGA significantly increased the length of the small intestine (P < 0.05) and enhanced the activity of diamine oxidase (DAO) and the concentration of MHC-II in the jejunal and ileal mucosa (P < 0.05). Moreover, the  concentration in ileum and cecum digesta, and the propionate and butyrate concentrations in the cecum digesta, were significantly elevated by CGA (P < 0.05). Interestingly, CGA significantly increased the total 16S rRNA gene copies and bacterial alpha diversity in the cecum (P < 0.05). The relative abundance of bacteria from phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was increased in the cecum digesta (P < 0.05), whereas the abundance of bacteria from phylum Protebacteria was decreased by CGA (P < 0.05). Importantly, pigs on CGA-containing diet had higher abundance of Lactobacillus spp., Prevotella spp., Anaerovibrio spp., and Alloprevotella spp. in the cecum (P < 0.05).

Analysis of the experimental results showed that peak hydrogen production differed according to the ammonia and Na concentration. The peak hydrogen production levels achieved were (97.60, 91.94, and 49.31) ml/g COD at (291.41, 768.75, and 1,037.89) mg-N/L of ammonia and (600, 1,000, and 4,000) mg-Na/L of salt concentration, respectively. At peak hydrogen production, the ammonia concentration increased along with increasing salt concentration in the medium. This means that for peak hydrogen production, the C/N ratio decreased with increasing salt content in the medium. The butyrate/ (B/A) ratio was higher in proportion to the bio-hydrogen production (r-square: 0.71, -value: 0.0006).

These results indicated that BM increased the concentration of total SCFAs in the distal colonic digesta. These changes might have been caused by fructan and resistant starch in addition to β-glucan. In conclusion, fermentable fibers in BM reached the distal colon and modified the , leading to an increase in the concentration of total SCFAs in the distal colonic digesta, more effectively compared with the high-β-glucan barley line (BG).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30591685>Higher Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acid Levels Are Associated with Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis, Obesity, Hypertension and Cardiometabolic Disease Risk Factors.</a></h2><p>Fiber fermentation by gut  yields short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are either absorbed by the gut or excreted in feces. Studies are conflicting as to whether SCFAs are beneficial or detrimental to cardiometabolic health, and how gut  associated with SCFAs is unclear. In this study of 441 community-dwelling adults, we examined associations of fecal SCFAs, gut  diversity and composition, gut permeability, and cardiometabolic outcomes, including obesity and hypertension. We assessed fecal  by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and SCFA concentrations by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Fecal SCFA concentrations were inversely associated with  diversity, and 70 unique microbial taxa were differentially associated with at least one SCFA (, butyrate or propionate). Higher SCFA concentrations were associated with a measure of gut permeability, markers of metabolic dysregulation, obesity and hypertension. Microbial diversity showed association with these outcomes in the opposite direction. Associations were significant after adjusting for measured confounders. In conclusion, higher SCFA excretion was associated with evidence of gut dysbiosis, gut permeability, excess adiposity, and cardiometabolic risk factors. Studies assessing both fecal and circulating SCFAs are needed to test the hypothesis that the association of higher fecal SCFAs with obesity and cardiometabolic dysregulation is due to less efficient SCFA absorption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490117>Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Systemic Hypertension: Gut Dysbiosis as the Mediator?</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and systemic hypertension (SH) are common and interrelated diseases. It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal  transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH. More studies are needed in humans to elicit the effect of positive airway pressure therapy on gut dysbiosis.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772029>Effects of lysophospholipids on short-term production, nitrogen utilization, and rumen fermentation and bacterial population in lactating dairy cows.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to examine effects of supplemental lysophospholipids (LPL) in dairy cows. Eight ruminally cannulated lactating Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Dietary treatments were (1) a dairy ration [CON; 55% forage and 45% concentrate on a dry matter (DM) basis], (2) a positive control diet supplemented with monensin (MON; 16 mg/kg in dietary DM; Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN], (3) a control diet supplemented with low LPL (0.05% of dietary DM; Lipidol Ultra, Easy Bio Inc., Seoul, South Korea), and (4) a control diet supplemented with high LPL (0.075% of dietary DM). Experimental periods were 21 d with 14-d diet adaptation and 7-d sample collection. Daily intake and milk yield were measured and rumen contents were collected for fermentation characteristics and bacterial population. Spot urine and fecal samples (8 samples/cow per period) were collected to determine nutrient digestibility and dietary N utilization. All data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC; group and cow within group were random effects and treatments, time, and their interaction were fixed effects). Preplanned contrasts were made to determine effect of MON versus CON, effect of LPL versus MON, and linear effect of increasing LPL. In the current study, responses to MON generally agreed with effects of monensin observed in the literature (increased milk yield and feed efficiency but decreased milk fat content). Supplementation of LPL to the diet did not alter DM intake but linearly increased milk yield, resulting in increases in feed efficiency (milk yield/DM intake) and milk protein and fat yields. However, total-tract digestibility of DM and organic matter tended to be lower (60.9 vs. 62.2% and 61.8 vs. 63.1%, respectively) for LPL compared with CON. Linear increases in milk N secretion and decreases in urinary N excretion were observed with increasing LPL in the diet. A slight decrease in  proportion in the rumen for LPL was found. Relative to MON, very few bacteria in the rumen were affected with increasing LPL. In conclusion, LPL is a potential feed additive that can increase milk yield and components and dietary N utilization. However, more studies with large numbers of animals are needed to confirm the effect of LPL on production. Similar positive effects on production were observed between LPL and MON, but individual mechanisms were likely different according to ruminal fermentation characteristics. Further studies are needed to explore the mode of action of LPL in dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Ingestion of the prebiotic Bimuno™ galacto-oligosaccharide (B-GOS) is one such intervention that has been shown to attenuate olanzapine-induced weight gain and improve cognitive flexibility in rats, potentially through mechanisms involving , the major short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) that is produced by B-GOS fermentation. The present study investigated the individual influences of B-GOS and sodium  intake on brain histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities, cortical and hippocampal expression of HDAC1-4 and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunits in saline or olanzapine injected female rats. The effect of sodium  on olanzapine-induced weight gain was also investigated. Daily ingestion of B-GOS for 21 days, reduced HDAC activity and hippocampal HDAC-4, and elevated levels of cortical HDAC-1 and HDAC-3 mRNAs. Sodium  supplementation significantly decreased HAT, but not HDAC, activity and increased hippocampal HDAC-3 and HDAC-4 mRNAs. Olanzapine-induced weight gain and fourteen genera of intestinal bacteria, were not influenced by sodium  intake. Together these data suggests the effects of B-GOS in rats cannot be replicated by  ingestion, and that mechanisms beyond the production of this SCFA are likely to underlie the psychotropic and metabolic actions of this prebiotic.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Plasma was precipitated with ethyl  and determined by UPLC-MS/MS method,with genistein as an internal standard. In terms of specificity,linearity,range,accuracy,precision and stability,the method was suitable for the determination of baicalin in plasma. The gut microbiotadysbiosis rat model was induced through the oral administration with lincomycin hydrochloride(5 g·kg-1·d-1) for one week. Samples of plasma of rats were obtained at different time points,after the rats were administrated with baicalin,baicalin and PEG400. Baicalin in rats were detected by UPLC-MS/MS method,and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by DAS 3. 2. 2 software. The results showed that the β-glucosidase activity and the number of colonies in the feces of gut microbiotadysbiosis rats induced by lincomycin hydrochloride were significantly reduced. The Cmaxand AUC0-tof the baicalinand PEG400 group in the intestinal flora were significantly lower than those in the normal rat baicalin and PEG400 group. There was no significant difference in Cmaxand AUC0-tbetween the baicalin group and the baicalin+PEG400 group of gut microbiotadysbiosis rats. The Cmaxand AUC0-tof the normal rats baicalin group were significantly higher than those of the gut microbiotadysbiosis rats baicalin group and the baicalin + PEG400 group.

The present study comprised 100 cross-bred piglets, weaned at 28 days old, who were randomly assigned to four POM diets with five replicates per diet and five piglets per pen.POM supplementation (P < 0.05) decreased the incidence of diarrhea, and also increased the average daily feed intake and average daily gain of pigs. Fecal , butyrate and propionate increased with the addition of POM. Interleukin-2, immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, tumor necrosis factor-α and immunoglobulin A increased (P < 0.05) with the addition of POM. The 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the dominant microbial strains in the fecal samples, irrespective of POM supplementation. Shannon diversity, whole tree phylogenetic diversity, observed species and Chao1 analysis exhibited significant variation in species richness across the treatments. Principal coordinates analysis showed a significant (P < 0.1) increase in the microbial communities amongst all of the treatment groups.The results of the present study suggest that the supplementation of POM in the diet of piglets might increase feed consumption, gut microbial composition and diversity, as well as short-chain fatty acids synthesis, consequently preventing the occurrence of diarrhea and increasing the growth of piglets. © 2019 The Authors.

Production of PHA by an MMC enriched with PHA-accumulating bacteria was compared using anaerobically treated and acidified brewery wastewaters under various feeding strategies, namely pulse and batch feed addition. To obtain an enriched MMC, a sequencing batch reactor was inoculated with activated sludge fed with  and subjected to aerobic dynamic feeding. The enriched MMC was able to accumulate PHA up to 72.6% of cell dry weight (CDW) with pulse addition of  controlled by the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the reactor.

Using anaerobically treated and acidified brewery wastewater fed in pulses, the maximum PHA accumulated by the enriched MMC was similar for both wastewaters (45% CDW), in spite of the higher volatile fatty acid concentration in acidified brewery wastewater. The pulse feed addition controlled by the DO concentration was difficult to implement for wastewater as compared to  because the difference in DO concentration between substrate availability and depletion was low. For the batch addition of acidified wastewater, a slightly lower PHA content (39% CDW) was obtained. These results show that both brewery wastewaters can be utilized for PHA production with a similar maximum PHA storage capacity.Copyright © 2018.

The reproducibility of such research is based on an assumption of metabolic similarity between experimental animals, controlled for by breeding and housing strategies that minimise genetic and environmental variation. Here, we set out to demonstrate the effect of experimental uraemia on the rat urinary metabolome and gut microbiome but found instead that the effect of vendor shipment batch was larger in both areas than that of uraemia.Twenty four Wistar rats obtained from the same commercial supplier in two separate shipment batches underwent either subtotal nephrectomy or sham procedures. All animals undergoing subtotal nephrectomy developed an expected uraemic phenotype. The urinary metabolome was studied using H-NMR spectroscopy and found to vary significantly between animals from different batches, with substantial differences in concentrations of a broad range of substances including lactate, , glucose, amino acids, amines and benzoate derivatives. In animals from one batch, there was a complete absence of the microbiome-associated urinary metabolite hippurate, which was present in significant concentrations in animals from the other batch. These differences were so prominent that we would have drawn quite different conclusions about the effect of uraemia on urinary phenotype depending on which batch of animals we had used. Corresponding differences were seen in the gut  between animals in different batches when assessed by the sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, with higher alpha diversity and different distributions of Proteobacteria subtaxa and short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria in the second batch compared to the first. Whilst we also demonstrated differences in both the urinary metabolome and gut  associated with uraemia, these effects were smaller in size than those associated with shipment batch.These results challenge the assumption that experimental animals obtained from the same supplier are metabolically comparable, and provide metabolomic evidence that batch-to-batch variations in the microbiome of experimental animals are significant confounders in an experimental study. We discuss strategies for reducing such variability and the need for transparency in research publications about the supply of experimental animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586712>Loss of Gut  Alters Immune System Composition and Cripples Postinfarction Cardiac Repair.</a></h2><p>The impact of gut  on the regulation of host physiology has recently garnered considerable attention, particularly in key areas such as the immune system and metabolism. These areas are also crucial for the pathophysiology of and repair after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the role of the gut  in the context of MI remains to be fully elucidated.To investigate the effects of gut  on cardiac repair after MI, C57BL/6J mice were treated with antibiotics 7 days before MI to deplete mouse gut . Flow cytometry was applied to examine the changes in immune cell composition in the heart. 16S rDNA sequencing was conducted as a readout for changes in gut microbial composition. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) species altered after antibiotic treatment were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Fecal reconstitution, transplantation of monocytes, or dietary SCFA or Lactobacillus probiotic supplementation was conducted to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of  on the mice after MI.Antibiotic-treated mice displayed drastic, dose-dependent mortality after MI. We observed an association between the gut  depletion and significant reductions in the proportion of myeloid cells and SCFAs, more specifically , butyrate, and propionate. Infiltration of CX3CR1+ monocytes to the peri-infarct zone after MI was also reduced, suggesting impairment of repair after MI. Accordingly, the physiological status and survival of mice were significantly improved after fecal reconstitution, transplantation of monocytes, or dietary SCFA supplementation. MI was associated with a reorganization of the gut microbial community such as a reduction in Lactobacillus. Supplementing antibiotic-treated mice with a Lactobacillus probiotic before MI restored myeloid cell proportions, yielded cardioprotective effects, and shifted the balance of SCFAs toward propionate.Gut -derived SCFAs play an important role in maintaining host immune composition and repair capacity after MI. This suggests that manipulation of these elements may provide opportunities to modulate pathological outcome after MI and indeed human health and disease as a whole.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354652>Effects of Hardwood Biochar on Methane Production, Fermentation Characteristics, and the Rumen  Using Rumen Simulation.</a></h2><p>Biochar is a novel carbonized feed additive sourced from pyrolyzed biomass. This compound is known to adsorb gasses and carbon, participate in biological redox reactions and provide habitat biofilms for desirable  proliferation. Therefore, biochar holds potential to modify rumen fermentation characteristics and reduce enteric CH emissions. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of hardwood biochar supplementation on fermentation parameters, methane (CH) production and the ruminal archaeal, bacterial, and fungal  using the  RUSITEC (rumen simulation technique) system. Treatments consisted of a control diet (oaten pasture: maize silage: concentrate, 35:35:30 w/w) and hardwood biochar included at 400 or 800 mg per day (3.6 and 7.2% of substrate DM, respectively), over a 15-day period. Biochar supplementation had no effect ( ≥ 0.37) on pH, effluent (mL/d), total gas (mL/d), dry matter (DM) digestibility or CH production (mg/d). The addition of 800 mg biochar per day had the tendency ( = 0.10) to lower the % of CH released in fermentation compared to 400 mg/d biochar treatment. However, no effect ( ≥ 0.44) was seen on total VFA, , propionate, butyric, branched-chain VFA, valerate and caproate production and the ratio of  to propionate. No effect ( > 0.05) was observed on bacterial, archaeal or fungal community structure. However, biochar supplementation at 800 mg/d decreased the abundance of one Methanomethylophilaceae OTU (19.8-fold,  = 0.046) and one  spp. OTU (31.7-fold,  < 0.01), in comparison to control treatments. Two fungal OTUs classified as  (5.4 × 10 increase) and  (5.4 × 10-fold increase) were more abundant in the 800 mg/d biochar samples. In conclusion, hardwood biochar had no effects on ruminal fermentation characteristics and may potentially lower the concentration of enteric CH when included at higher dosages by manipulating ruminal  abundances.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612083>Novel ecological insights and functional roles during anaerobic digestion of saccharides unveiled by genome-centric metagenomics.</a></h2><p>In typical anaerobic digestion (AD) systems, the microbial functional assertion is hampered by synchronised versatile metabolism required for heterogeneous substrates degradation. Thus, the intricate methanogenic process from organic compounds remains an enigma after decades of empirical operation. In this study, simplified AD microbial communities were obtained with substrate specifications and continuous reactor operation. Genome-centric metagenomic approach was followed to holistically investigate the metabolic pathways of the AD and the microbial synergistic networks. In total, 63 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) were assembled from 8 metagenomes acquired in specific methanogenic niches. The metabolic pathways were reconstructed from the annotated genes and their dynamicity under experimental conditions. The results show that the methanogenic niches nourish unique metabolism beyond current knowledge acquired from cultivation-based methods. A novel glucose mineralization model without  formation was proposed and asserted in a pair of syntrophs: Clostridiaceae sp. and Methanoculleus thermophilus. Moreover, the catabolic pathway was elucidated in uncharacterized syntrophic  oxidizers, Synergistaceae spp. A remarkable evolutionary insight is the discovery that electron transport and energy conservation mechanisms impose selective pressure on syntrophic partners. Overall, the functional roles of the individual microbes tightly rely on the catabolic pathways and cannot always be physiologically defined in accordance with conventional four-step AD concept. The substrate-specific systems provided a traceable microbial community to dissecting the AD process. The genome-centric metagenomics successfully constructed genomes of microbes that have not been previously isolated and illustrated metabolic pathways that beyond the current knowledge of AD process. This study provides new perspectives to unravel the AD microbial ecology and suggests more attention should be paid on uncharacterized metabolism specifically harboured by AD microbial communities.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Results indicated that although the three different HRTs provided a stable process with a steady-state of methane production, both methane yield (161 L kg-VS 25% higher) and volatile solids removal (VS, 50%, 2-fold higher) increased during longer HRTs. Redundancy analysis results indicated that Sporosarcina and Methnosarcina positively correlated to VS removal and methane yield, and negatively correlated to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulation. The relative abundance of Coprothermobacter (>60%), syntrophic  oxidation bacteria (SAOB), and Methanospirillum (8-15%), increased during shorter HRTs. A slight shift to two-stage  conversion was observed during shorter HRTs. The results demonstrated that HRTs played a key role in shaping microbial structure, leading to a new steady-state of microbial community profiles and process performances at variable HRTs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epithelial cells lining the FGT provide the first barrier to HIV-1 entry. Previous studies have suggested that certain hormonal contraceptives or a dysbiosis of the vaginal  can enhance HIV-1 acquisition in the FGT. We examined the effects of lactobacilli and female sex hormones on the barrier functions and innate immune responses of primary endometrial genital epithelial cells (GECs). Two probiotic strains,  RC-14 and  GR-1, were tested, as were sex hormones estrogen (E2), progesterone (P4), and the hormonal contraceptive medroxyprogesterone  (MPA). Our results demonstrate that probiotic lactobacilli enhance barrier function without affecting cytokines. Treatment of GECs with MPA resulted in reduced barrier function. In contrast, E2 treatment enhanced barrier function and reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Comparison of hormones plus lactobacilli as a pre-treatment prior to HIV exposure revealed a dominant effect of lactobacilli in preventing loss of barrier function by GECs. In summary, the combination of E2 and lactobacilli had the best protective effect against HIV-1 seen by enhancement of barrier function and reduction in proinflammatory cytokines. These studies provide insights into how probiotic lactobacilli in the female genital microenvironment can alter HIV-1-mediated barrier disruption and how the combination of E2 and lactobacilli may decrease susceptibility to primary HIV infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30660825>Interactions between gut  and non-alcoholic liver disease: The role of -derived metabolites.</a></h2><p>There is increasing evidence that the intestinal  plays a mechanistic role in the etiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Animal and human studies have linked small molecule metabolites produced by commensal bacteria in the gut contribute to not only intestinal inflammation, but also to hepatic inflammation. These immunomodulatory metabolites are capable of engaging host cellular receptors, and may mediate the observed association between gut dysbiosis and NAFLD. This review focuses on the effects and potential mechanisms of three specific classes of metabolites that synthesized or modified by gut bacteria: short chain fatty acids, amino acid catabolites, and bile acids. In particular, we discuss their role as ligands for cell surface and nuclear receptors regulating metabolic and inflammatory pathways in the intestine and liver. Studies reveal that the metabolites can both agonize and antagonize their cognate receptors to reduce or exacerbate liver steatosis and inflammation, and that the effects are metabolite- and context-specific. Further studies are warranted to more comprehensively understand bacterial metabolite-mediated gut-liver in NAFLD.

Fifty-four Holstein calves were assigned to three treatments and fed whole milk (M), pasteurized waste milk (WM), or milk replacer (MR). Male calves were slaughtered at the age of two months to measure the stomach masses. The female calves were followed for six months to determine the body weight, blood indices, rumen fermentation, and ruminal bacterial community. At the age of two months, the average daily gain was lower, but the concentration of total volatile fatty acids was greater in the MR group. Starter intake and stomach mass were lower, but the isovalerate molar proportion was greater in the WM group. The blood indices and ruminal bacterial community of the WM group differed from those of the other groups. At the age of six months, the ruminal propionate molar proportion was lower, but the ruminal pH and /propionate ratio were greater in the MR group. In conclusion, calves fed WM had different rumen fermentation and bacterial community during the weaning period, whereas feeding MR produced a long-lasting effect on the rumen environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31394488>Effect of inoculum concentration on methanogenesis by direct interspecies electron transfer: Performance and microbial community composition.</a></h2><p>To understand the effect of inoculum concentration on direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) for methanogenesis, batch-type anaerobic bioreactors with different inoculum concentrations were operated with and without supplemented granular activated carbon (GAC). With decrease in inoculum concentration, GAC-supplemented bioreactors showed faster methane production rates and reduced lag times. Geobacter species were specifically enriched on the GAC surfaces under lower inoculum concentration conditions. Together, the relative abundance of aceticlastic methanogens (competitors of Geobacter species for ) gradually decreased when the inoculum concentration increased.

A total of 240 weaned piglets (d 23 ± 2) from 16 pens (15 piglets per pen) were randomly allocated to an antibiotics group (25% quinocetone 200 mg kg-1 and 4% enduracidin 800 mg kg-1 of the basal diet) or a YG group (800 mg kg-1 YG of the basal diet), respectively. The trial lasted 14 days, and at the end of the trial, one piglet per pen was chosen to collect plasma, intestinal tissue and colonic digesta samples. The results indicate that piglets fed diets containing YG tended to show increased final body weight (0.05 < P < 0.1), increased average daily gain (P < 0.05) and decreased F/G (P < 0.05) when compared with the antibiotics group. Moreover, intestinal permeability showed that YG led to an improvement in the intestinal development via decreasing serum content of DAO (P < 0.01). Histological evaluations showed that YG contributed to the improvement of the intestinal development via increasing villous height (P < 0.05) and the villous height to crypt depth ratio (P < 0.01), and decreasing crypt depth (P < 0.01) and villous width (P < 0.05) in the ileum. Intestinal integrity also showed that YG was conducive to improvement of the intestinal development via upregulating the m-RNA expression of occludin (P < 0.05) in the duodenal and jejunal mucosa. Interestingly, YG supplementation downregulated the m-RNA expression of IL-12 (P < 0.05), upregulated the m-RNA expression of Hsp-70 (P < 0.05) in the duodenal mucosa, downregulated the m-RNA expression of Hsp-70 (P < 0.05) and IFN-γ (P < 0.05), upregulated the m-RNA expression of Hsp-90 (P < 0.05) in the jejunal mucosa, and upregulated the m-RNA expression of Hsp-70 (P < 0.05) in the ileal mucosa. On the other hand, colonic  results showed that YG supplementation increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus (P < 0.05) in the genus level. Colonic metabolite results showed that YG supplementation decreased the content of  (P < 0.05). Taken together, it is speculated that YG would be a potent alternative to prophylactic antibiotics in improving the gut health in weaned piglets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805695>Effects of a polysaccharide-rich extract derived from Irish-sourced Laminaria digitata on the composition and metabolic activity of the human gut  using an in vitro colonic model.</a></h2><p>Brown seaweeds are known to be a rich source of fiber with the presence of several non-digestible polysaccharides including laminarin, fucoidan and alginate. These individual polysaccharides have previously been shown to favorably alter the gut  composition and activity albeit the effect of the collective brown seaweed fiber component on the  remains to be determined.This study investigated the effect of a crude polysaccharide-rich extract obtained from Laminaria digitata (CE) and a depolymerized CE extract (DE) on the gut  composition and metabolism using an in vitro fecal batch culture model though metagenomic compositional analysis using 16S rRNA FLX amplicon pyrosequencing and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis using GC-FID.Selective culture analysis showed no significant changes in cultured lactobacilli or bifidobacteria between the CE or DE and the cellulose-negative control at any time point measured (0, 5, 10, 24, 36, 48 h). Following metagenomic analysis, the CE and DE significantly altered the relative abundance of several families including Lachnospiraceae and genera including Streptococcus, Ruminococcus and Parabacteroides of human fecal bacterial populations in comparison to cellulose after 24 h. The concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and total SCFA were significantly higher for both the CE and DE compared to cellulose after 10, 24, 36 and 48 h fermentation (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the :propionate ratio was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) for both CD and DE following 24, 36 and 48 h fermentation.The -associated metabolic and compositional changes noted provide initial indication of putative beneficial health benefits of L. digitata in vitro; however, research is needed to clarify if L. digitata-derived fiber can favorably alter the gut  and confer health benefits in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30965613>Short Chain Fatty Acid Production from Mycoprotein and Mycoprotein Fibre in an In Vitro Fermentation Model.</a></h2><p>Dietary mycoprotein (marketed as Quorn) has many health benefits, including reductions in energy intake. The majority of studies evaluating mycoprotein focus on the protein content and very few consider the fibre content. Fibre consumption is also associated with decreased energy intake, which is partly attributed to short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) from fibre fermentation by colonic bacteria. To study the SCFA-producing capability of mycoprotein, in vitro batch fermentations were conducted, and SCFA production compared with that from extracted mycoprotein fibre, oligofructose (OF), rhamnose, and laminarin. Mycoprotein and mycoprotein fibre were both fermentable, resulting in a total SCFA production of 24.9 (1.7) and 61.2 (15.7) mmol/L, respectively. OF led to a significantly higher proportion of  compared to all other substrates tested (92.6 (2.8)%,  < 0.01). Rhamnose generated the highest proportion of propionate (45.3 (2.0)%,  < 0.01), although mycoprotein and mycoprotein fibre yielded a higher proportion of propionate compared with OF and laminarin. Butyrate proportion was the highest with laminarin (28.0 (10.0)although mycoprotein fibre led to a significantly higher proportion than OF ( < 0.01). Mycoprotein is a valuable source of dietary protein, but its fibre content is also of interest. Further evaluation of the potential roles of the fibre content of mycoprotein is required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510995>Toll-Like Receptor 7 Agonist-Induced Dermatitis Causes Severe Dextran Sulfate Sodium Colitis by Altering the Gut Microbiome and Immune Cells.</a></h2><p>Psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are both chronic inflammatory diseases occurring in the skin and gut, respectively. It is well established that psoriasis and IBD have high concordance rates, and similar changes in immune cells and microbiome composition have been reported in both conditions. To study this connection, we used a combination murine model of psoriatic dermatitis and colitis in which mice were treated topically with the Toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod (IMQ) and fed dextran sulfate sodium (DSS).We applied IMQ topically to B6 mice (IMQ mice) and subsequently fed them 2% DSS in their drinking water. Disease activity and immune cell phenotypes were analyzed, and the microbial composition of fecal samples was investigated using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. We transplanted feces from IMQ mice to germ-free IQI/Jic (IQI) mice and fed them DSS to assess the effect of the gut microbiome on disease.We first confirmed that IMQ mice showed accelerated DSS colitis. IMQ mice had decreased numbers of IgD and IgM B cells and increased numbers of non-cytokine-producing macrophages in the gut. Moreover, the gut microbiomes of IMQ mice were perturbed, with significant reductions of  and  populations. Germ-free mice transplanted with feces from IMQ mice, but not with feces from untreated mice, also developed exacerbated DSS colitis.These results suggest that skin inflammation may contribute to pathogenic conditions in the gut via immunologic and microbiological changes. Our finding of a novel potential skin-gut interaction provides new insights into the coincidence of psoriasis and IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31164448>Antibiotic Exposure Has Sex-Dependent Effects on the Gut  and Metabolism of Short-Chain Fatty Acids and Amino Acids in Mice.</a></h2><p>The gut  has the capability to regulate homeostasis of the host metabolism. Since antibiotic exposure can adversely affect the microbiome, we hypothesized that antibiotic effects on the gut  and host metabolism are sex dependent. In this study, we examined the effects of antibiotic treatments, including vancomycin (Vanc) and ciprofloxacin-metronidazole (CiMe), on the gut microbiome and metabolome in colonic contents and tissues in both male and female mice. We found that the relative abundances and structural composition of  were significantly reduced in female mice after both Vanc and CiMe treatments but in male mice only after treatment with Vanc. However, Vanc exposure considerably altered the relative abundances and structural composition of representatives of the  especially in male mice. The levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; , butyrate, and propionate) in colonic contents and tissues were significantly decreased in female mice after both antibiotic treatments, while these reductions were detected in male mice only after Vanc treatment. However, another SCFA, formate, exhibited the opposite tendency in colonic tissues. Both antibiotic exposures significantly decreased the levels of alanine, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and aromatic amino acids (AAAs; phenylalanine and tyrosine) in colonic contents of female mice but not in male mice. Additionally, female mice had much greater correlations between microbe and metabolite than male mice. These findings suggest that sex-dependent effects should be considered for antibiotic-induced modifications of the gut  and host metabolism. Accumulating evidence shows that the gut  regulates host metabolism by producing a series of metabolites, such as amino acids, bile acids, fatty acids, and others. These metabolites have a positive or negative effect on host health. Antibiotic exposure can disrupt the gut  and thereby affect host metabolism and physiology. However, there are a limited number of studies addressing whether antibiotic effects on the gut  and host metabolism are sex dependent. In this study, we uncovered a sex-dependent difference in antibiotic effects on the gut  and metabolome in colonic contents and tissues in mice. These findings reveal that sex-dependent effects need to be considered for antibiotic use in scientific research or clinical practice. Moreover, this study will also give an important direction for future use of antibiotics to modify the gut microbiome and host metabolism in a sex-specific manner.Copyright © 2019 Gao et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309620>Ruminal  composition associated with ruminal fermentation parameters and milk yield in lactating buffalo in Guangxi, China-A preliminary study.</a></h2><p>The ruminal  of 15 dairy buffalo was characterized using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Results showed that Bacteroidetes was the dominant bacterial phylum in all rumen samples, followed by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes and Verrucomicrobia. Butyrivibrio was positively correlated with average milk fat yield (R = 0.55; p = 0.03), average milk total solid yield (R = 0.56; p = 0.03) and standard milk yield (R = 0.52; p = 0.05). Acinetobacter were positively correlated with average milk protein yield (R = 0.56; p = 0.03), average milk total solid yield (R = 0.60; p = 0.02) and standard milk yield (R = 0.57; p = 0.03).

This lethal hereditary disease has known or suspected links to the dysbiosis gut . High-throughput meta-omics-based approaches may assist in unveiling this complex network of symbiosis modifications.The aim of this study was to provide a predictive and functional model of the gut  enterophenotype of pediatric patients affected by CF under clinical stability.Thirty-one fecal samples were collected from CF patients and healthy children (HC) (age range, 1-6 years) and analysed using targeted-metagenomics and metabolomics to characterize the ecology and metabolism of CF-linked gut . The multidimensional data were low fused and processed by chemometric classification analysis.The fused metagenomics and metabolomics based gut  profile was characterized by a high abundance of Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus and Clostridiaceae, including Clostridium difficile, and a low abundance of Eggerthella, Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Dorea, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Lachnospiraceae, associated with overexpression of 4-aminobutyrate (GABA), choline, ethanol, propylbutyrate, and pyridine and low levels of sarcosine, 4-methylphenol, uracil, glucose, , phenol, benzaldehyde, and methylacetate. The CF gut  pattern revealed an enterophenotype intrinsically linked to disease, regardless of age, and with dysbiosis uninduced by reduced pancreatic function and only partially related to oral antibiotic administration or lung colonization/infection.All together, the results obtained suggest that the gut  enterophenotypes of CF, together with endogenous and bacterial CF biomarkers, are direct expression of functional alterations at the intestinal level. Hence, it's possible to infer that CFTR impairment causes the gut ecosystem imbalance.This new understanding of CF host-gut  interactions may be helpful to rationalize novel clinical interventions to improve the affected children's nutritional status and intestinal function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802715>EtOAc extract of H. attenuatum Choisy inhibits inflammation by suppressing the NF-κB and MAPK pathways and modulating the gut .</a></h2><p>Hypericum attenuatum Choisy, a traditional Chinese herb, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of diseases associated with inflammation and has been used to treat rheumatic arthritis in China for centuries. However, the underlying mechanism of its anti-inflammatory effect is poorly understood.In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of EtOAc fractions of H. attenuatum Choisy (Ha-EtOAc) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophage inflammation and hypothesized that Ha-EtOAc could attenuate inflammation in the colon.LPS was utilized to induce RAW264.7 cells inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effect of Ha-EtOAc in RAW264.7 cells was evaluated by measuring the inhibition ratio of nitric oxide (NO) production. Murine ulcerative colitis (UC) was induced by treatment with 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The basic indexes of the mice, including body weight, food intake and hematochezia, were recorded during mice experiments.The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Additionally, the influences of Ha-EtOAc on the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways were determined by western blot and immunofluorescence assays. In addition, the impact of Ha-EtOAc on gut  of mice with UC was detected by 16S rDNA sequencing.Ha-EtOAc inhibited the LPS-induced production of NO and decreased the release of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment with Ha-EtOAc could suppress the nuclear translocation of p65 and the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38 and JNK. Ha-EtOAc treatment ameliorated murine UC, as reflected by a reduced body weight loss, improved colon shortening, alleviated mucosal damage and decreased releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, Ha-EtOAc could modulate the composition of microbial communities.Our results demonstrated that Ha-EtOAc exhibited anti-inflammatory effects mainly by suppressing the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, and Ha-EtOAc treatment may be a potent therapy for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Methanogens described in human  include only Euryarchaeota, i.e. Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter oralis, Methanobrevibacter arbophilus, Methanobrevibacter massiliensis, Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Ca. Methanomethylophilus alvus and Ca. Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis. Methanogens are emerging pathogens associated with brain and muscular abscesses. They have been implicated in dysbiosis of the oral , periodontitis and peri-implantitis. They have also been associated with dysbiosis of the digestive tract  linked to metabolic disorders (anorexia, malnutrition and obesity) and with lesions of the digestive tract (colon cancer). Their detection in anaerobic pus specimens and oral and digestive tract specimens relies on microscopic examination by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, specific DNA extraction followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification of the 16S rRNA and mcrA gene fragments and isolation and culture in the supporting presence of hydrogen-producing bacteria. Diagnostic identification can be performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and can be further completed by genotyping through multi-spacer sequencing and, ultimately, whole genome sequencing (WGS). Ornidazole derivatives, fusidic acid and rifampicin are the compounds to be included in in vitro susceptibility testing to complete the clinical workflow. Clinical microbiology laboratories should work toward developing cheap and easy protocols for the routine detection and identification of methanogens in selected specimens in order to refine the diagnosis of infections, as well as to expand the knowledge about this group of intriguing microorganisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31477562>Modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet modulates gut microbiome and short-chain fatty acids in association with Alzheimer's disease markers in subjects with mild cognitive impairment.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence is increasing, but its etiology remains elusive. Gut microbes can contribute to AD pathology and may help identifying novel markers and therapies against AD. Herein, we examine how the gut microbiome differs in older adults with mild cognitive impairment compared to cognitively normal counterparts, and whether and how a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet (MMKD) alters the gut microbiome signature in association with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers.A randomized, double-blind, cross-over, single-center pilot study of MMKD versus American Heart Association Diet (AHAD) intervention is performed on 17 subjects (age: 64.6 ± 6.4 yr), of which 11 have mild cognitive impairment, while 6 are cognitively normal. Subjects undergo MMKD and AHAD intervention for 6-weeks separated by 6-weeks washout periods. Gut microbiome, fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and markers of AD in CSF including amyloid β (Aβ)-40 and Aß-42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau-181 (tau-p181) are measured at before and after diet interventions.At baseline, subjects with normal vs. impaired cognition show no notable difference in microbiome diversity but several unique microbial signatures are detected in subjects with mild cognitive impairment. Proteobacteria correlate positively with Aβ-42: Aβ-40 while fecal propionate and butyrate correlates negatively with Aβ-42 in subjects with mild cognitive impairment. Several bacteria are differently affected by the two diets with distinct patterns between cognitively normal and impaired subjects. Notably, the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, Akkermansia, Slackia, Christensenellaceae and Erysipelotriaceae increases while that of Bifidobacterium and Lachnobacterium reduces on MMKD, while AHAD increases Mollicutes. MMKD slightly reduces fecal lactate and  while increasing propionate and butyrate. Conversely, AHAD increases  and propionate while reducing butyrate.The data suggest that specific gut microbial signatures may depict the mild cognitive impairment and that the MMKD can modulate the gut microbiome and metabolites in association with improved AD biomarkers in CSF.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to identify the effect of a short-term diet high in sugar on susceptibility to colitis. Adult wild-type mice were placed on chow or a high sugar diet (50% sucrose) ± . After two days of diet, mice were treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis. Disease severity was assessed daily. Colonic tissues were analyzed for cytokine expression using the MesoScale discovery platform. Intestinal dextran permeability and serum lipopolysaccharide levels (LPS) were measured. Gut  were analyzed by 16s rRNA sequencing and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations by gas chromatography. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were incubated with LPS and cytokine secretion measured. Mice on a high sugar diet had increased gut permeability, decreased microbial diversity and reduced SCFA. BMDM derived from high sugar fed mice were highly responsive to LPS. High sugar fed mice had increased susceptibility to colitis and pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations. Oral  significantly attenuated colitis in mice by restoring permeability. In conclusion, short term exposure to a high sugar diet increases susceptibility to colitis by reducing short-chain fatty acids and increasing gut permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612141>Administration of  KBL375 Causes Taxonomic and Functional Changes in Gut  Leading to Improvement of Atopic Dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Gut  play an important role in immune responses and energy metabolism. In this study, we evaluated whether administration of  () KBL375 isolated from healthy Korean feces improves the atopic dermatitis using the house dust mite ()-induced atopic dermatitis (AD) mouse model. Administration of  KBL375 significantly decreased dermatitis score, ear and dorsal thickness, and serum immunoglobulin E level in AD-induced mice. Significant reductions in mast cells and eosinophils were discovered in skin tissues from  KBL375-treated mice. T helper 2 cell-related cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-31 significantly decreased, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 or transforming growth factor-β increased in skin tissues from  KBL375-treated mice. In addition to phenotypic changes in skin tissues,  KBL375 treatment induced an increase in the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cell population in mesenteric lymph nodes. Taxonomic and functional analyses of gut  showed significantly higher cecum bacterial diversities and abundances including genus , and  in  KBL375-treated mice. Metabolic analysis of the cecum also showed significant changes in the levels of various amino acids including methionine, phenylalanine, serine, and tyrosine, as well as short chain fatty acids such as , butyrate, and propionate in AD-induced mice due to  KBL375 treatment. These altered metabolites in AD-induced mice returned to the levels similar to those in control mice when treated with  KBL375. Therefore,  KBL375 could be useful for AD treatment by modulating the immune system and inducing various metabolites.Copyright © 2019 Kim, Jang, Han, Seo, Park, Lee and Ko.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31073525>Fecal  of Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients Causes Hepatic Inflammation of Germ-Free Rats and Berberine Reverses It Partially.</a></h2><p>Effects of the microbiome associated with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) on the gut have been reported, but no study has reported the effects of the IBS-D gut microbiome on the liver. We transplanted the fecal  from an IBS-D patient and from a healthy volunteer to GF rats. The hepatic inflammation, serum biochemical parameters and metabolome, fecal  profile, fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and correlations among them before and after berberine intervention were assessed. Compared with the healthy control fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) rats, the fecal  of IBS-D patients induces significant Kupffer cell hyperplasia, hepatic sinusoid hypertrophy, and elevated levels of hepatic tumor necrosis factor- and interferon- and decreases the synthesis of ALB in GF rats. This is possibly related to  and  attributable to fecal formate, , and propionate levels, which are associated with the host linoleic acid pathway. Berberine can partially reverse the Kupffer cell hyperplasia, , fecal formate, , and propionate by modulating the gut microbiome composition.

We evaluated the effects of whole-grain or refined cereals on fasting and postprandial serum adiponectin in people at high cardiovascular risk. According to a randomised controlled parallel group design, participants with metabolic syndrome were assigned to an isoenergetic diet based on either whole-grain cereal (WGC) or refined cereal (RC) products for 12-weeks. Anthropometric and biochemical measures were taken. Compared to baseline, fasting and postprandial serum adiponectin levels increased after both RC and WGC.

However, this effect has not been demonstrated in humans. In this study, we tested the effects of RS in 19 volunteers with normal body weights. A randomized, double-blinded and crossover design clinical trial was conducted. The study subjects were given either 40 g high amylose RS2 or energy-matched control starch with three identical diets per day throughout the study. The effect of RS was evaluated by monitoring body fat, glucose metabolism, gut hormones, gut , short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and metabolites. The visceral and subcutaneous fat areas were significantly reduced following RS intake.  and early-phase insulin, C-peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion were increased, and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were decreased after the RS intervention. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, certain gut microbes were significantly decreased after RS supplementation, whereas the genus Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 showed an increase in abundance. Other potential signatures of the RS intervention included Akkermansia, Ruminococcus_2, Victivallis, and Comamonas.

The influence of the following ionic liquids: benzalkonium (2,4-dichlorophenoxy) (BA)(2,4-D), benzalkonium (4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy) (BA)(MCPA), didecyldimethylammonium (2,4-dichlorophenoxy) (DDA)(2,4-D), didecyldimethylammonium (4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy) (DDA)(MCPA), as well as reference herbicides (4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)acetic acid (MCPA) and (2,4-dichlorophenoxy)acetic acid (2,4-D) in the form of sodium salts on biogas production efficiency was investigated. The effective concentration (EC50) values were determined for all tested compounds. (MCPA) was the most toxic, with an EC50 value of 38.6⁻41.2 mg/L. The EC50 for 2,4-D was 55.7⁻59.8 mg/L. The addition of the test substances resulted in changes of the population structure of the  which formed the fermentation pulp. The research was based on 16S rDNA analysis with the use of the Next Generation Sequencing method and the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). There was a significant decrease in bacteria belonging to  and Archaea belonging to . A significant decrease of the biodiversity of the methane fermentation  was also established, which was expressed by the decrease of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and the value of Shannon's entropy. In order to determine the functional potential of bacterial metapopulations based on the 16SrDNAprofile, the PICRUSt(Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States)tool was used, which allowed to determine the gene potency of microorganisms and their ability to biodegrade the herbicides. In the framework of the conducted analysis, no key genes related to the biodegradation of MCPA or 2,4-D were found, and the observed decrease of their content in the supernatant liquid was caused by their sorption on bacterial biomass.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384520>Suppressive effect of dietary resistant maltodextrin on systemic immunity in a mouse model of food allergy.</a></h2><p>Resistant maltodextrin (RMD) is a soluble dietary fibre that exerts several physiological functions as a result of its microbial degradation and changes in the intestinal environment. It has been reported that RMD enhanced immunoglobulin A (IgA) secretion, which protects the mucosa from foreign substances. However, the effect of RMD on excessive immunity has yet to be investigated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of RMD on excessive immune responses such as food allergy. OVA23-3 mice were fed an AIN-76-based diet containing 20% egg-white protein with or without RMD. While RMD was shown to contribute to an increase in goblet cells, RMD did not change the overall inflammatory status when ingested with the egg-white diet. RMD suppressed IL-4 and IL-10 production from splenocytes but not cells from mesenteric lymph nodes. RMD also downregulated the serum levels of OVA-specific Th1- and Th2-related antibodies, which were elevated in the food-allergic condition. RMD significantly increased the total amount of short-chain fatty acids, especially  and propionate, in the caecum of OVA23-3 mice fed the egg-white diet. Our study demonstrated that dietary RMD modulates systemic rather than intestinal antigen-specific immune responses in the food-allergic condition of OVA23-3 mice. Although the relevant mechanism has yet to be investigated, RMD shows potential for alleviating food allergy through adjustment of systemic immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796005>Bacterial viability in faecal transplants: Which bacteria survive?</a></h2><p>The therapeutic potential of faecal  transplantation (FMT) is under investigation for a range of inflammatory conditions. While mechanisms of benefit are poorly understood, most models rely on the viability of transplanted microbes. We hypothesised that protocols commonly used in the preparation of faecal transplants will substantially reduce the number, diversity and functional potential of viable microbes.Stools from eight screened donors were processed under strict anaerobic conditions, in ambient air, and freeze-thawed. Propidium monoazide (PMA) sample treatment was combined with quantitative PCR, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis to define the viable  composition and functional potential.Approximately 50% of bacterial content of stool processed immediately under strict anaerobic conditions was non-viable. Homogenisation in ambient air or freeze-thaw reduced viability to 19% and 23% respectively. Processing of samples in ambient air resulted in up to 12-fold reductions in the abundance of important commensal taxa, including the highly butyrogenic species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Subdoligranulum variable, and Eubacterium hallii. The adverse impact of atmospheric oxygen exposure on the capacity of the transplanted  to support SCFA biosynthesis was demonstrated by significantly reduced butyrate and  production by faecal slurries processed in ambient air. In contrast, while reducing overall levels of viable bacteria, freeze-thaw did not significantly alter viable  composition.The practice of preparing material for faecal transplantation in ambient air profoundly affects viable microbial content, disproportionately reducing the abundance of anaerobic commensals and the capacity for biosynthesis of important anti-inflammatory metabolites.

However, the US Great Basin, in particular the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS, formerly the Nevada Test Site), has hosted a number of influential subsurface investigations over the years. This investigation focuses on resident  recovered from a hydrogeologically confined aquifer in fractured Paleozoic carbonate rocks at 863 - 923 meters below land surface. Analysis of the microorganisms living in this oligotrophic environment provides a perspective into microbial metabolic strategies required to endure prolonged hydrogeological isolation deep underground. Here we present a microbiological and physicochemical characterization of a deep continental carbonate ecosystem and describe a bacterial genus isolated from the ecosystem. Strain DRI-13 is a strictly anaerobic, moderately thermophilic, fumarate-respiring member of the phylum . This bacterium grows optimally at 55°C and pH 8.0, can tolerate a concentration of 100 mM NaCl, and appears to obligately metabolize fumarate to  and succinate. Culture-independent 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicates a global subsurface distribution, while the closest cultured relatives of DRI-13 are  (90.0% similarity) and  (88.0% similarity). The predominant fatty acid profile is iso-C  , C  , C   and C  . The percentage of the straight-chain fatty acid C   is a defining characteristic not present in the other closely related species. The genome is estimated to be 3,649,665 bp, composed of 87.3% coding regions with an overall average of 45.1% G + C content. Strain DRI-13 represents a novel genus of subsurface bacterium isolated from a previously uncharacterized rock-hosted geothermal habitat. The characterization of the bacterium combined with the sequenced genome provides insights into metabolism strategies of the deep subsurface biosphere.

Here, we present a method for the quantification of SCFAs in fecal samples by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) upon derivatization to 3-nitrophenylhydrazones (3NPH). The method includes , propionate, butyrate, and isobutyrate with a run time of 4 min. The reproducible (coefficients of variation (CV) below 10%) quantification of SCFAs in human fecal samples was achieved by the application of stable isotope labelled internal standards. The specificity was demonstrated by the introduction of a quantifier and qualifier ions. The method was applied to investigate the pre-analytic stability of SCFAs in human feces. Concentrations of SCFA may change substantially within hours; the degree and kinetics of these changes revealed huge differences between the donors. The fecal SCFA level could be preserved by the addition of organic solvents like isopropanol. An analysis of the colon content of mice either treated with antibiotics or fed with a diet containing a non-degradable and -fermentable fiber source showed decreased SCFA concentrations. In summary, this fast and reproducible method for the quantification of SCFA in fecal samples provides a valuable tool for both basic research and large-scale studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30674645>Wood-Derived Dietary Fibers Promote Beneficial Human Gut .</a></h2><p>Woody biomass is a sustainable and virtually unlimited source of hemicellulosic polysaccharides. The predominant hemicelluloses in softwood and hardwood are galactoglucomannan (GGM) and arabinoglucuronoxylan (AGX), respectively. Based on the structure similarity with common dietary fibers, GGM and AGX may be postulated to have prebiotic properties, conferring a health benefit on the host through specific modulation of the gut . In this study, we evaluated the prebiotic potential of acetylated GGM (AcGGM) and highly acetylated AGX (AcAGX) obtained from Norwegian lignocellulosic feedstocks  In pure culture, both substrates selectively promoted the growth of , , and  species in a manner consistent with the presence of genetic loci for the utilization of β-manno-oligosaccharides/β-mannans and xylo-oligosaccharides/xylans. The prebiotic potential of AcGGM and AcAGX was further assessed in a pH-controlled batch culture fermentation system inoculated with healthy adult human feces. Results were compared with those obtained with a commercial fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) mixture. Similarly to FOS, both substrates significantly increased (0.05) the  population. Other bacterial groups enumerated were unaffected with the exception of an increase in the growth of members of the - group, , and clostridial cluster IX (0.05). Compared to the other substrates, AcGGM promoted butyrogenic fermentation whereas AcAGX was more propiogenic. Although further  confirmation is necessary, these results demonstrate that both AcGGM and AcAGX from lignocellulosic feedstocks can be used to direct the promotion of beneficial bacteria, thus exhibiting a promising prebiotic ability to improve or restore gut health. The architecture of the gut bacterial ecosystem has a profound effect on the physiology and well-being of the host. Modulation of the gut  and the intestinal microenvironment via administration of prebiotics represents a valuable strategy to promote host health. This work provides insights into the ability of two novel wood-derived preparations, AcGGM and AcAGX, to influence human gut  composition and activity. These compounds were selectively fermented by commensal bacteria such as , -, , and clostridial cluster IX spp. This promoted the microbial synthesis of , propionate, and butyrate, which are beneﬁcial to the microbial ecosystem and host colonic epithelial cells. Thus, our results demonstrate potential prebiotic properties for both AcGGM and AcAGX from lignocellulosic feedstocks. These findings represent pivotal requirements for rationally designing intervention strategies based on the dietary supplementation of AcGGM and AcAGX to improve or restore gut health.Copyright © 2019 La Rosa et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30540558>Metformin induces weight loss associated with gut  alteration in non-diabetic obese women: a randomized double-blind clinical trial.</a></h2><p>The increasing prevalence of obesity over the past few decades constitutes a global health challenge.

Here, the microbial diversity of faecal samples of two guinea pigs and microbial enrichments made with substrates, including starch waste and dried grass, were investigated along with organic acid production profiles. The microbial communities of the faecal samples were dominated by the phyla Bacteroidetes (40%) and Firmicutes (36%). Bacteroidales S24-7 (11% in Cavy 1 and 21% in Cavy 2) was the most abundant order. At genus level, many microorganisms remained unclassified.

The organic acid production profiles corresponded to a mixed acid fermentation but differed depending on the substrate. Eight phylogenetically different isolates were obtained, including a novel Streptococcus species, strain Cavy grass 6.

Cavy grass 6, a fast-growing heterolactic bacterium, ferments cellobiose to lactate, , formate and ethanol. Our results show that cavy faecal samples can be applied as microbial source for organic acid production from complex organic substrates.

The effects are partially mediated by -produced short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, propionate and . The anti-cancer effect of butyrate has been demonstrated in cancer cell cultures and animal models of cancer. Butyrate, as a signaling molecule, has effects on multiple signaling pathways. The most studied effect is its inhibition on histone deacetylase (HDAC), which leads to alterations of several important oncogenic signaling pathways such as JAK2/STAT3, VEGF. Butyrate can interfere with both mitochondrial apoptotic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. In addition, butyrate also reduces gut inflammation by promoting T-regulatory cell differentiation with decreased activities of the NF-κB and STAT3 pathways. Through PKC and Wnt pathways, butyrate increases cancer cell differentiation. Furthermore, butyrate regulates oncogenic signaling molecules through microRNAs and methylation. Therefore, butyrate has the potential to be incorporated into cancer prevention and treatment regimens. In this review we summarize recent progress in butyrate research and discuss the future development of butyrate as an anti-cancer agent with emphasis on its effects on oncogenic signaling pathways. The low bioavailability of butyrate is a problem, which precludes clinical application. The disadvantage of butyrate for medicinal applications may be overcome by several approaches including nano-delivery, analogue development and combination use with other anti-cancer agents or phytochemicals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316490>The Capacity of the Fecal  From Malawian Infants to Ferment Resistant Starch.</a></h2><p>In Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC), weaning is associated with environmentally acquired and inflammation-associated enteric disorders. Dietary intake of high amylose maize starch (HAMS) can promote commensal fermentative bacteria and drive the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). By stabilizing commensal gut microbiology, and stimulating the production of anti-inflammatory metabolites, HAMS supplementation might therefore influence enteric health. However, the extent to which the gut  of LMIC infants are capable of fermenting HAMS is unclear. We assessed the capacity of the fecal  from pre-weaning and weaning Malawian infants to ferment HAMS and produce SCFAs using an  fermentation model. Fecal  from both pre-weaning and weaning infants were able to ferment HAMS, as indicated by an increase in bacterial load and total SCFA concentration, and a reduction in pH. All of these changes were more substantial in the weaning group.  production was observed with both pre-weaning and weaning groups, while propionate production was only observed in the weaning group. HAMS fermentation resulted in significant alterations to the fecal microbial community in the weaning group, with significant increases in levels of , and  associated with propionate production. In conclusion, fecal  from Malawian infants before and during weaning has the capacity to produce  through HAMS fermentation, with propionate biosynthetic capability appearing only at weaning.

This study elucidated the effect of transglycosylated starch (TGS) on the retention of digesta in the upper digestive tract, ileal flow and hindgut disappearance of nutrients, and subsequent bacterial profiles in pigs. Fourteen ileal-cannulated growing pigs were fed either the TGS or control (CON) diet in a complete crossover design. Each period consisted of a 10-d adaptation to the diets, followed by 3-d collection of faeces and ileal digesta. Consumption of TGS decreased the retention of digesta in the stomach and small intestine, and increased ileal DM, starch, Ca and P flow, leading to enhanced starch fermentation in the hindgut compared with CON-fed pigs. TGS increased ileal and faecal total SCFA, especially ileal and faecal  and faecal butyrate. Gastric retention time positively correlated to Klebsiella, which benefitted together with Selenomonas, Lactobacillus, Mitsuokella and Coriobacteriaceae from TGS feeding and ileal starch flow. Similar relationships existed in faeces with Coriobacteriaceae, Veillonellaceae and Megasphaera benefitting most, either directly or indirectly via cross-feeding, from TGS residuals in faeces. TGS, in turn, depressed genera within Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales and Christensenellaceae compared with the CON diet.

Because gut  studies are limited due to ethical and safety concerns,  fermentation models were developed as powerful tools to assess effects of environmental conditions on the gut . In this study, we established a continuous colonic fermentation model (PolyFermS), inoculated with immobilized fecal  and mimicking the proximal colon of 2-month-old infants. We investigated the effects of pH and retention time (RT) on lactate metabolism and of lactate-utilizing bacteria (LUB) exhibiting little or no H production. We observed that a drop in pH from 6.0 to 5.0 increased the number of lactate-producing bacteria (LPB) and decreased LUB concomitantly with lactate accumulation. Increasing RT from 5 to 10 h at pH 5.0 resulted in complete lactate consumption associated with increased LUB. Supplementation with dl-lactate (60 mM) to mimic lactate accumulation promoted propionate and butyrate production with no effect on  production. We further demonstrated that lactate-utilizing  was able to colonize the reactors 4 days after spiking, suggesting its ability to compete with other lactate-utilizing bacteria producing H In conclusion, we showed that PolyFermS is a suitable model for mimicking young infant colonic . We report for the first time pH and RT as strong drivers for composition and metabolic activity of infant gut , especially for the metabolism of lactate, which is a key intermediate product for ecology and infant health. The metabolism of lactate is important for infant gut health and may lead to acute lactate and/or H accumulation, pain, and crying as observed in colicky infants. Functional human studies often faced ethical challenges due to invasive medical procedures; thus, in this study, we implemented PolyFermS fermentation models to mimic the infant proximal colon, which were inoculated with immobilized fecal  of two 2-month-old infants. We investigated the impact of pH, retention time, and accumulation of dl-lactate on  composition and metabolic activity. We found that a drop in pH from 6.0 to 5.0 led to increased LPB and decreased LUB concomitantly with lactate accumulation. Increasing the RT resulted in complete lactate consumption associated with increased LUB.

Several aromatic amino-acids such as phenylacetic acid, imidazole propionate, and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate have been identified as potential inducers of steatosis and hepatic inflammation, whereas indolic compounds (indole and indole-3-) seem to preserve liver integrity. Current clinical trials aim at evaluating the efficacy of novel approaches (functional foods, prebiotic and probiotics, and fecal microbial transplants).The  brings new hopes in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Adequate intervention studies in targeted patients are needed to unravel the relevance of such approaches in the management of those liver diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284906>Strategies to improve aerobic granular sludge stability and nitrogen removal based on feeding mode and substrate.</a></h2><p>A systemic strategy was proposed to improve aerobic granular sludge (AGS) stability and nitrogen (N) removal efficiency by optimizing feeding mode and substrate aiming at complicated wastewater characteristics. Key functional groups at the genus level identified by high-throughput sequencing were evaluated as well. The results showed that anaerobic feeding mode and  promoted the compact AGS formation with excellent total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency (averaging 91.7% ± 4.1%) at various dissolved oxygen conditions. While the aerobic feeding mode led to a loose AGS structure with a vulnerable anaerobic core and poor TN removal efficiency (averaging 58.8% ± 7.4%). Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process played the dominant role in N removal in compact AGS over the alternating nitrification and denitrification process. High-concentration glucose undermined feast-famine condition with filamentous bacteria growth out of granule and decreased TN removal efficiency to 67.3% ± 15.2%. Lower food to microorganism ratio may result in a lower N removal rate attributed to the sharply increased biomass concentration fed by glucose. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, denitrifying bacteria, and denitrifying phosphorus accumulation organisms enriched during AGS granulation also contributed to the efficient N removal. The proposed strategy provided insights into the relationship between various factors and stable AGS formation, and systemic operation methods for various complicated wastewater treatment.Copyright © 2019.

The pathogenesis of such adverse effects is of multifactorial origin.We investigated whether SGAs drive dysbiosis, assessed whether gut  alterations affect body weight and metabolic outcomes, and looked for the possible mechanism of metabolic disturbances secondary to SGA treatment in animal and human studies.A systematic literature search (PubMed/Medline/Embase/ClinicalTrials.gov/PsychInfo) was conducted from database inception until 03 July 2018 for studies that reported the microbiome and weight alterations in SGA-treated subjects.Seven articles reporting studies in mice (experiments = 8) and rats (experiments = 3) were included. Olanzapine was used in five and risperidone in six experiments. Only three articles (experiments = 4) in humans fit our criteria of using risperidone and mixed SGAs. The results confirmed microbiome alterations directly (rodent experiments = 5, human experiments = 4) or indirectly (rodent experiments = 4) with predominantly increased Firmicutes abundance relative to Bacteroidetes, as well as weight gain in rodents (experiments = 8) and humans (experiments = 4). Additionally, olanzapine administration was found to induce both metabolic alterations (adiposity, lipogenesis, plasma free fatty acid, and  levels increase) (experiments = 3) and inflammation (experiments = 2) in rodents, whereas risperidone suppressed the resting metabolic rate in rodents (experiments = 5) and elevated fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, LDL, hs-CRP, antioxidant superoxide dismutase, and HOMA-IR in humans (experiment = 1). One rodent study suggested a gender-dependent effect of dysbiosis on body weight.Antipsychotic treatment-related microbiome alterations potentially result in body weight gain and metabolic disturbances.

The purpose of this experiment is to study the relative toxicity of hydrogen sulfide and survival of Desulfovibrio piger Vib-7 through monitoring: sulfate reduction parameters (sulfate consumption, hydrogen sulfide production, lactate consumption and  production) and kinetic parameters of these processes. The research is highlighting the survival of intestinal SRB, D. piger Vib-7 under the influence of different hydrogen sulfide concentrations (1-7 mM). The highest toxicity of HS was measured in the presence of concentrations higher than 6 mM, where growing was stopped, though metabolic activities were not 100% inhibited. These findings are confirmed by cross correlation and principal component analysis that clearly supported the above mentioned results. The kinetic parameters of bacterial growth and sulfate reduction were inhibited proportionally with increasing HS concentration. The presence of 5 mM HS resulted in two times longer lag phase and generation time was eight times longer. Maximum rate of growth and hydrogen production was stopped under 4 mM, emphasizing the HS toxicity concentrations to be < 4 mM, even for sulfide producing bacteria such as Desulfovibrio. The results are confirming HS concentrations toxicity toward Desulfovibrio, especially the study novelty should be emphasized where it was found that the exact HS limits (> 4 mM) toward this bacterial strain inhabiting humans and animals intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30656801>Spatial variations in intestinal skatole production and microbial composition in broilers.</a></h2><p>Spatial variations in intestinal skatole production and microbial composition in broilers were evaluated. Fifteen 42-day-old broilers were slaughtered. Samples were taken from the broilers' ileum, cecum, and rectum and analyzed for skatole levels. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique was used to analyze the microbial community from the intestinal digesta. The skatole levels could be arranged in decreasing order: cecum > rectum > ileum. Cecal lactate and  levels were higher than those of ileum and rectum (p < 0.01). Cecal microbial diversity and richness were higher than those of ileum (p < 0.05). One specific DGGE band was found in cecal sample and is closely related to Bacteroides uniformis. Cecum and rectum samples consisted of three coexistence bands, the related bacteria included Lactobacillus vaginalis and two members of Candidatus Arthromitus. The total bacterial population in cecum was higher than that in ileum and rectum (p < 0.05). Skatole levels were positively correlated with microbial Shannon-Wiener index, richness, total bacteria (p < 0.01) and Lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium (p < 0.05) populations. These results suggest that the variations in fermentation patterns are more likely to explain differences in intestinal skatole level. Bacteroides uniformis may play a role in the production of skatole.© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30683741>Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 15696 and Bifidobacterium breve 24b Metabolic Interaction Based on 2'--Fucosyl-Lactose Studied in Steady-State Cultures in a Freter-Style Chemostat.</a></h2><p>Infants fed breast milk harbor a gut  in which bifidobacteria are generally predominant. The metabolic interactions of bifidobacterial species need investigation because they may offer insight into the colonization of the gut in early life.  ATCC 15696 hydrolyzes 2'--fucosyl-lactose (2FL; a major fucosylated human milk oligosaccharide) but does not use fucose released into the culture medium. However, fucose is a growth substrate for  24b, and both strains utilize lactose for growth. The provision of fucose and lactose by  (the donor) allowing the growth of  (the beneficiary) conforms to the concept of syntrophy, but both strains will compete for lactose to multiply. To determine the metabolic impact of this syntrophic/competitive relationship on the donor, the transcriptomes of  were determined and compared in steady-state monoculture and coculture using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).  genes upregulated in coculture included those encoding alpha-l-fucosidase and carbohydrate transporters and those involved in energy production and conversion.  abundance was the same in coculture as in monoculture, but  dominated the coculture numerically. Cocultures during steady-state growth in 2FL medium produced mostly  with little lactate (:lactate molar ratio, 8:1) compared to that in monobatch cultures containing lactose (2:1), which reflected the maintenance of steady-state cells in log-phase growth. Darwinian competition is an implicit feature of bacterial communities, but syntrophy is a phenomenon putatively based on cooperation. Our results suggest that the regulation of syntrophy, in addition to competition, may shape bacterial communities. This study addresses the microbiology and function of a natural ecosystem (the infant bowel) using  experimentation with bacterial cultures maintained under controlled growth and environmental conditions. We studied the growth of bifidobacteria whose nutrition centered on the hydrolysis of a human milk oligosaccharide. The results revealed responses relating to metabolism occurring in a  strain when it provided nutrients that allowed the growth of , and so discovered biochemical features of these bifidobacteria in relation to metabolic interaction in the shared environment. These kinds of experiments are essential in developing concepts of bifidobacterial ecology that relate to the development of the gut  in early life.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170585>Effects of ozone treatment on performance and microbial community composition in biofiltration systems treating ethyl  vapours.</a></h2><p>Ozone (O) treatment is an effective strategy in maintaining high efficiency and control of biomass accumulation in gas phase biofiltration. However, little is known about the long-term impact of O on the microbial communities. In the present study, two biofilters treating gaseous ethyl  were operated continuously for 230 days with inlet loads up to 180 g m∙h. A biofilter operated under continuous O addition (90 ppb) yielded consistently higher removal efficiency (RE) and elimination capacity (EC) compared to the control system. After 120 days of operation, a lower biomass content accompanied by a pH of 1.5 was observed in the ozonated biofilter, which was 2 units lower compared to the control reactor. Both reactors developed a distinct microbial community composition over the course of 230 days. The bacterial community was dominated in both biofilters by Beijerinckia and Gluconacetobacter, while Rhinocladiella similis, Trichosporon veenhuissi and Exophilia oligosperma were abundant in the fungal community. These findings suggest that ozonation of the biofiltration systems not only reduced clogging, but also contributed to the selection of biomass suitable for degradation of ethyl .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-fiber diets alter not only microbial composition but also the availability of metabolic end products derived from fermentation of fiber. Our objective was to examine the effects of dietary fiber supplementation on gut  and associated fecal and serum metabolites in relation to metabolic markers of obesity. We conducted a 12-week, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 53 adults with overweight or obesity. They were randomly assigned to a pea fiber (PF, 15 g/d in wafer form; n=29) or control (CO, isocaloric amount of wafers; n=24) group. Blood and fecal samples were collected at baseline and 12 weeks. Serum metabolomics, gut  and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BAs) were examined. Within-group but not between-group analysis showed a significant effect of treatment on serum metabolites at 12 weeks compared to baseline.

As the identity and activities of the various members of this community have become clearer, newly identified health-associated bacteria, such as  and  species, have emerged. Notably, the abundance of many of these bacteria is inversely correlated to several disease states.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were immunophenotyped. Bacterial DNA was extracted from stool, and amplicons targeting the V4 region of the bacterial/archaeal 16S rRNA gene were sequenced (Illumina MiSeq). Raw reads were clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units using the GreenGenes database. Differential abundance analysis was performed using linear discriminant analysis effect size. Phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states was used to investigate changes to functional pathways resulting from differential taxon abundance.One hundred sixty-eight participants were included (treatment-naive n = 75, DMF n = 33, and GA n = 60). Disease-modifying therapies were associated with changes in the fecal  composition. Both therapies were associated with decreased relative abundance of the  and  families. In addition, DMF was associated with decreased relative abundance of the phyla Firmicutes and Fusobacteria and the order Clostridiales and an increase in the phylum Bacteroidetes. Despite the different changes in bacterial taxa, there was an overlap between functional pathways affected by both therapies.Administration of GA or DMF is associated with differences in gut microbial composition in patients with MS.

Microbes inhabiting in the fermentation pit mud largely determines baijiu's flavour and quality. In order to shed light on the microbial functional groups driving butyrate production in pit mud, clone library analysis was firstly performed and the results demonstrated that Clostridia (relative abundance: 50%) and Bacilli (37%) were major groups possessing butyrate kinase (buk) pathway and Clostridia (98%) dominated butyryl-CoA: CoA-transferase (but) pathway. According to Clostridial specific-16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we found the resilience character of Clostridial community in pit mud. Amongst Clostridial groups, 32.0% of the sequences were grouped into Clostridiales incertae sedis, followed by Heliobacteriaceae (18.3%) and Clostridiaceae 1 (8.4%). Moreover, Hydrogenispora, Sedimentibacter and Clostridium were the top three abundant genera. Relative abundance of Hydrogenispora was higher in the late days of fermentation, while Sedimentibacter exhibited higher proportion in the early days. Different from the previous studies using universal bacterial primer sets, Hydrogenispora was first reported as one dominant genus in pit mud. As for the reported potential butyrate producer Clostridium, nineteen species were obtained and ten of them were first isolated from the pit mud. Amongst them, buk was identified in eleven species by PCR analysis, while but was identified in the other seven, indicating the species-specific butyrate synthesis pathways of Clostridium.

There are some indications that SCFAs inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in rodents, but research on this subject is sparse. However, it has been reported that receptors for SCFAs, free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) and FFAR3 are expressed not only on gut endocrine cells secreting GLP-1 and PYY, but also on pancreatic islet cells. We hypothesized that SCFAs might influence the endocrine secretion from pancreatic islets similar to their effects on the enteroendocrine cells. We studied this using isolated perfused mouse pancreas which responded adequately to changes in glucose and to infusions of arginine. None of the SCFAs, , propionate and butyrate, influenced glucagon secretion, whereas they had weak inhibitory effects on somatostatin and insulin secretion. Infusions of two specific agonists of FFAR2 and FFAR3, CFMB and Compound 4, respectively, did not influence the pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon, whereas both induced strong increases in the secretion of somatostatin. In conclusion, the small effects of , propionate and butyrate we observed here may not be physiologically relevant, but the effects of CFMB and Compound 4 on somatostatin secretion suggest that it may be possible to manipulate pancreatic secretion pharmacologically with agonists of the FFAR2 and 3 receptors, a finding which deserves further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557247>Dietary supplementation with the extract from Eucommia ulmoides leaves changed epithelial restitution and gut microbial community and composition of weanling piglets.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to compare the effects of Eucommia ulmoides leaves (EL) in different forms (EL extract, fermented EL, and EL powder) with antibiotics on growth performance, intestinal morphology, and the  composition and diversity of weanling piglets.

Bowel movement was assessed using the Bristol stool form scale (BSFS) and constipation scoring system (CSS). Dietary habit was assessed with a self-administered questionnaire wherein the food intake frequency was classified into 8 categories for 72 food/food groups. Gut  was analyzed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.The constipation rate was significantly higher in females than in males. The QOL was significantly impaired in the constipated group. The fecal count of Bacteroides was decreased and that of Clostridium cluster IV was increased in participants with constipation. The BSFS score was negatively associated with the fecal count of Clostridium cluster XI and positively associated with the fecal count of Clostridium cluster XVIII and consumption of green tea. The total CSS score was positively associated with the fecal Prevotella count and negatively associated with fecal  levels and consumption of vegetables. Discriminant analysis estimated that constipation could be predicted correctly in 83% (p < 0.001) of the participants based on fecal  and fecal short-chain fatty acids.Bowel movement was strongly affected by gut environment and food intake in Japanese participants. Improvement in dietary habits could promote bowel movement through the improvement of the environment in the gut, resulting in ameliorated QOL issues in healthy adults.© 2019 S.

They are resistant to salivary amylase and gastric juice. In the present study the prebiotic potentials of different pectic derived substrates were performed by using intestinal cultures and measuring the growth, change in pH and short chain fatty acid, (SCFA) production. Arabinan, arabinogalactan, and rhamnogalacturonan were fermented by probiotic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium breve, Bi. longum, Bi. bifidum, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (commensal bacteria). While, polygalacturonic acid was fermented by Ba. fragilis, Ba. thetaiotaomicron, and Ba. uniformis. All the screened bacteria significantly decreased the pH from 7 to 5 (pH difference of ≈ 2), which clearly indicated that the above bacteria produced the enzymes necessary for the digestion of the pectic derived polysaccharides. The SCFA profiles of the above screened bacteria clearly demonstrated the production of lactate,  and propionate which are the key metabolites involved in maintaining gut health and prevention of several intestinal diseases. Thus, pectic polysaccharides hold potential application in food industry as prebiotic ingredients or dietary fibers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31000700>Metabolic potential of uncultured bacteria and archaea associated with petroleum seepage in deep-sea sediments.</a></h2><p>The lack of microbial genomes and isolates from the deep seabed means that very little is known about the ecology of this vast habitat. Here, we investigate energy and carbon acquisition strategies of microbial communities from three deep seabed petroleum seeps (3 km water depth) in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. Shotgun metagenomic analysis reveals that each sediment harbors diverse communities of chemoheterotrophs and chemolithotrophs. We recovered 82 metagenome-assembled genomes affiliated with 21 different archaeal and bacterial phyla. Multiple genomes encode enzymes for anaerobic oxidation of aliphatic and aromatic compounds, including those of candidate phyla Aerophobetes, Aminicenantes, TA06 and Bathyarchaeota. Microbial interactions are predicted to be driven by  and molecular hydrogen. These findings are supported by sediment geochemistry, metabolomics, and thermodynamic modelling. Overall, we infer that deep-sea sediments experiencing thermogenic hydrocarbon inputs harbor phylogenetically and functionally diverse communities potentially sustained through anaerobic hydrocarbon,  and hydrogen metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596218>Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Systemic Hypertension: Gut Dysbiosis as the Mediator?</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and systemic hypertension (SH) are common and interrelated diseases. It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal  transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH. More studies are needed in humans to elicit the effect of positive airway pressure therapy on gut dysbiosis.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133321>Effect of Cobalt Chloride on Fermentation of Alfalfa and Smooth Bromegrass Hays by Horse Cecal Microorganisms.</a></h2><p>Effects of Co on fiber digestibility in horses are largely unknown. Our objective was to evaluate effects of Co chloride on in vitro gas production, VFA production, and dry matter (DM) disappearance (IVDMD) using cecal fluid from 4 cannulated Quarter Horses. Five grams DM of alfalfa or smooth bromegrass hay were provided as substrate with Co added at 0.0, 0.5, 5.0, 25.0, or 50.0 mg/kg substrate DM. Ten milliliters cecal fluid and 140 mL McDougall's buffer were incubated in duplicate, and pH, VFA concentrations, and IVDMD were measured after 48 hours. Gas production, used as an indicator of fermentative activity, was recorded every 15 minutes. Terminal pH was not affected by Co or forage type (P > .19). There was greater IVDMD in cultures containing alfalfa (29.2%) compared with smooth bromegrass hay (19.4%; P < .01). There was a forage × Co interaction (P < .05) in which gas production was greater in cultures containing alfalfa, and 5 mg Co/kg substrate DM led to greater gas production than 50 mg Co/kg substrate DM in cultures containing brome (P < .05). Gas production was affected by forage, Co, and time (P < .01). Production of individual and total VFA, as well as :propionate (A:P) ratio were increased in cultures containing alfalfa (P < .05); however, there were no effects of Co on VFA concentrations (P > .05). While gas production was influenced by Co in cultures containing brome, no effects of Co were observed for pH, VFA, or IVDMD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs , propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer. This article reviews the current knowledge concerning the effects of secondary BAs and SCFAs on the proliferation of colon epithelial cells, inflammation, cancer, and the associated microbiome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31099928>Fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations and dysbiosis in dogs with chronic enteropathy.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence shows an important relationship between the gastrointestinal (GI)  and host health.

The gut /gut hormone axis has recently received increasing attention. However, the relationship between the gut  and melatonin receptors has not yet been evaluated. We aimed to determine the effect of the gut  on colonic melatonin receptor expression in germ-free (GF) rats and to further explore the potential mechanism in Caco-2 cells. In this study, GF rats were transplanted with fecal samples from a healthy human donor. Subsequently, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to analyze the microbial communities. Colon tissue was collected for immunohistochemical analysis. The correlations between melatonin receptor expression and the gut  were assessed. Melatonin receptor expression in Caco-2 cells was detected by Western blot. We found that fecal  transplantation significantly increased the expression of colonic melatonin receptors in GF rats. The amount of fecal Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was significantly higher in fecal  transplantation (FMT) rats than in GF rats. SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Alistipes and Blautia, were positively correlated with colonic melatonin receptor expression in FMT rats. Additionally,  and propionate significantly increased melatonin receptor-1 expression in Caco-2 cells. Therefore, the gut  may promote melatonin receptor expression, and the mechanism may involve the action of SCFAs.

There is a need for novel dietary treatments for CD.We evaluated the effects of an individualized food-based diet (CD-TREAT), with similar composition to EEN, on the gut microbiome, inflammation, and clinical response in a rat model, healthy adults, and children with relapsing CD. Twenty-five healthy adults randomly received EEN or CD-TREAT for 7 days, followed by a 14-day washout period, followed by the alternate diet. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were assessed before and after each diet. HLA-B7 and HLA-B27 transgenic rats with gut inflammation received EEN, CD-TREAT, or standard chow for 4 weeks. Fecal, luminal, and tissue microbiome, fecal metabolites, and gut inflammation were assessed. Five children with active CD activity received CD-TREAT and their clinical activity and calprotectin were evaluated after 8 weeks of treatment.For healthy adults, CD-TREAT was easier to comply with and more acceptable than EEN. CD-TREAT induced similar effects to EEN (EEN vs CD-TREAT) on fecal microbiome composition, metabolome, mean total sulfide (increase 133.0 ± 80.5 vs 54.3 ± 47.0 nmol/g), pH (increase 1.3 ± 0.5 vs 0.9 ± 0.6), and the short-chain fatty acids (μmol/g)  (decrease 27.4 ± 22.6 vs 21.6 ± 20.4), propionate (decrease 5.7 ± 7.8 vs 5.2 ± 7.9), and butyrate (decrease 7.0 ± 7.4 vs 10.2 ± 8.5). In the rat model, CD-TREAT and EEN produced similar changes in bacterial load (decrease 0.3 ± 0.3 log 16S rRNA gene copies per gram), short-chain fatty acids, microbiome, and ileitis severity (mean histopathology score decreases of 1.25 for EEN [P = .015] and 1.0 for CD-TREAT [P = .044] vs chow).

Ten adult Beagles were involved in 5 feeding periods of 19 d in a cross-over design. Experimental diets contained 7.5% of total dietary fiber (TDF) from BSG or CAP and 20% or 40% of crude protein in dry matter. A diet with 3.5% TDF from both fiber sources and 20% crude protein was used as reference. Fecal dry matter was 27% higher for diets with BSG compared to CAP (P < 0.001). Apparent fecal digestibility of crude protein was 7% to 11% higher in diets with 40% protein concentration (P < 0.001), while apparent digestibility of crude fat was 2% to 3% higher for diets with CAP (P < 0.001). Carrot pomace increased the apparent fecal digestibility of TDF, phosphorus, and magnesium (P < 0.001), while 40% protein diets had a positive impact on TDF and sodium and a negative effect on magnesium apparent fecal digestibility (P < 0.001). Inclusion of CAP increased fecal short-chain fatty acids (P = 0.010), mainly  (P = 0.001). i-butyrate (P = 0.001), i-valerate (P = 0.002), biogenic amines (P < 0.001), and ammonium (P < 0.001) increased with higher dietary protein levels. Diet-induced changes in the fecal microbiome were moderate. Relative abundance of Bifidobacteriales was higher for the low-protein diets (P = 0.001). To conclude, BSG and CAP can be used as fiber sources in canine diets and are well tolerated even at higher inclusion rates, the effect on microbial protein fermentation seems to be limited compared to the dietary protein level.© The Author(s) 2019.

We recently showed that replacing corn with molassed sugar beet pulp (Bp) improved fiber degradation in high-producing dairy cattle, possibly because of an improvement of rumen and hindgut conditions for microbes by Bp feeding. However, little is known about the effects of high inclusion rates of Bp on hindgut microbes and fermentation. Thus fecal grab samples were taken from 18 high-yielding Simmental cows after 28 d of feeding 3 different levels of Bp (n = 6) for bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. In addition, the reticular pH was continuously monitored with indwelling sensors and eating and ruminating behavior was evaluated with noseband sensors. The Bp inclusion rates were 0 g/kg (i.e., no Bp inclusion as control, CON), 120 g/kg (12Bp), or 240 g/kg (24Bp) replacing corn grain and limestone on a dry matter basis. The amount of time spent eating and ruminating was unaffected by Bp level, and the daily fluctuation in the reticular pH was reduced by 25% with Bp inclusion from 0.8 in the CON diet to 0.6 in 24Bp fed animals. Also, the fecal pH tended to increase with dietary Bp inclusion. Fecal  production showed a quadratic tendency with the lowest concentration (58.9%) of the total short-chain fatty acid in the 12Bp treatment. Inclusion of Bp up to 24% of the diet decreased the fecal butyrate proportion by 27%. The Shannon diversity index was increased from 5.50 to 8.09 with dietary Bp inclusion indicating increased species diversity. Of the 200 most abundant operational taxonomic units, 25 were increased by dietary Bp inclusion, whereas 15 were decreased and 7 were quadratically affected. The second most abundant group was proposed taxon "CF231" of the family Paraprevotellaceae. Although it accounted for only 2.52% of the operational taxonomic units in the CON diet, it was increased by 64% with dietary Bp inclusion. The largest relative change in the abundance was found for the genus Fibrobacter that increased more than 14-fold from 0.04% (CON) to 0.66% (24Bp). In conclusion, feeding molassed sugar beet pulp as partial substitution of corn up to 240 g/kg is a viable alternative that promotes ruminal and hindgut fermentation by supporting physiological pH and bacterial diversity.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

This experiment evaluated the effects of a blend of prebiotics and dietary fibers on apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and fecal metabolites related to gastrointestinal health in adult dogs. Four diets containing either 5% cellulose (control; CT), 5% dietary fiber and prebiotic blend (FP), 0.02% saccharin and eugenol (SE), or 5% fiber blend plus 0.02% saccharin and eugenol (FSE) were formulated to meet or exceed the AAFCO (2017) nutritional requirements for adult dogs. Eight adult female beagles (mean age 4.2 ± 1.1 yr; mean BW = 10.8 ± 1.4 kg; mean BCS = 5.8 ± 0.6) were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 dietary treatments using a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Each experimental period consisted of 14 d (10 d of diet adaptation and 4 d of total and fresh fecal and total urine collection). All animals remained healthy throughout the study, with serum metabolites being within reference ranges for adult dogs. All diets were well accepted by the dogs, resulting in similar (P > 0.05) daily food intakes among treatments. Likewise, fecal output and scores did not differ (P > 0.05) among dietary treatments, with the latter being within the ideal range (2.5-2.9) in a 5-point scale. All diets were highly digestible and had similar (P > 0.05) ATTD of dry matter (81.6%-84.4%), organic matter (86.4%-87.3%), and crude protein (86.6%-87.3%). However, total dietary fiber (TDF) digestibility was greater for dogs fed the FSE diet (P < 0.05) in contrast with dogs fed the CT and SE diets, whereas dogs fed FP diets had intermediate TDF digestibility, but not different from all other treatments. Fecal  and propionate concentrations were greater (P < 0.05) for dogs fed FP and FSE diets. Fecal concentrations of isobutyrate and isovalerate were greater for dogs fed CT (P < 0.05) compared with dogs fed the other three treatments. No shifts in fecal microbial richness and diversity were observed among dietary treatments. Overall, the data suggest that dietary supplementation of fiber and prebiotic blend was well tolerated by dogs, did not cause detrimental effects on fecal quality or nutrient digestibility, and resulted in beneficial shifts in fecal metabolites that may support gut health.© The Author(s) 2019.

In piglets, this strategy could result in a reduction of post-weaning-associated disorders and the use of antibiotics. To date, mainly purified fractions have been tested for their prebiotic effects at weaning while trials of potential health-promoting effects of products and corresponding by-products remain rare. In this study, fructan- and pectin-based ingredients have been tested in a two-step in vitro model for their fermentation kinetics as well as for their short-chain fatty acid production and  profiles in fermentation broth as indicators for their prebiotic activity.Chicory root, in contrast to chicory pulp, exhibited an extensive and rapid fermentation similar to inulin and oligofructose, although butyrate levels of root and pulp did not reach those of the purified fractions. Chicory pulp showed higher relative levels of Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium cluster IV and butyryl-CoA:-CoA transferase gene abundance compared to chicory root. Sugar beet pulp, orange and citrus by-products displayed extensive gas fermentation patterns, equivalent to those of purified pectin, and revealed an elevated butyrate production compared to purified pectin. Moreover, several orange and citrus by-products displayed significantly higher relative levels of Bifidobacterium spp. in comparison to purified pectin.Chicory root and pulp as well as orange and citrus by-products appear to be promising ingredients for piglet diets for modulating intestinal fermentation for health purposes. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606162>Metagenomic insights into effects of thiamine supplementation on ruminal non-methanogen archaea in high-concentrate diets feeding dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Overfeeding of high-concentrate diet (HC) frequently leads to subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) in modern dairy cows' production. Thiamine supplementation has been confirmed to attenuate HC induced SARA by increasing ruminal pH and ratio of  to propionate, and decreasing rumen lactate, biogenic amines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The effects of thiamine supplementation in HC on rumen bacteria and fungi profile had been detected in our previous studies, however, effects of thiamine supplementation in HC on rumen non-methanogen archaea is still unclear. The objective of the present study was therefore to investigate the effects of thiamine supplementation on ruminal archaea, especially non-methanogens in HC induced SARA cows.HC feeding significantly decreased dry matter intake, milk production, milk fat content, ruminal pH and the concentrations of thiamine and  in rumen fluid compared with control diet (CON) (P < 0.05), while the concentrations of propionate and ammonia-nitrogen (NH-N) were significantly increased compared with CON (P < 0.05). These changes caused by HC were inversed by thiamine supplementation (P < 0.05). The taxonomy results showed that ruminal archaea ranged from 0.37 to 0.47% of the whole . Four characterized phyla, a number of Candidatus archaea and almost 660 species were identified in the present study. In which Euryarchaeota occupied the largest proportion of the whole archaea. Furthermore, thiamine supplementation treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of non-methanogens compared with CON and HC treatments. Thaumarchaeota was increased in HC compared with CON. Thiamine supplementation significantly increased Crenarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota and the Candidatus phyla, however decreased Thaumarchaeota compared with HC treatment.HC feeding significantly decreased ruminal pH and increased the content of NH-N which led to N loss and the increase of the relative abundance of Thaumarchaeota. Thiamine supplementation increased ruminal pH, improved the activity of ammonia utilizing bacteria, and decreased Thaumarchaeota abundance to reduce the ruminal NH content and finally reduced N loss. Overall, these findings contributed to the understanding of thiamine's function in dairy cows and provided new strategies to improve dairy cows' health under high-concentrate feeding regime.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027790>Bacterial communities and potential spoilage markers of whole blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) stored under commercial simulated conditions.</a></h2><p>Bacterial communities composition using 16S Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) profile of whole blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) stored at 4 and 10 °C (proper and abuse temperature) simulating real storage conditions were performed. Conventional microbiological and chemical analyses (Total Volatile Base-Nitrogen/TVB-N and Trimethylamine-Nitrogen/TMA-N) were also carried out. The rejection time point was 10 and 6 days for the whole crabs stored at 4 and 10 °C, respectively, as determined by development of unpleasant odors, which coincided with crabs death. Initially, the Aerobic Plate Count (APC) was 4.87 log cfu/g and increased by 3 logs at the rejection time. The 16S NGS analysis of DNA extracted directly from the crab tissue (culture-independent method), showed that the initial  of the blue crab mainly consisted of Candidatus Bacilloplasma, while potential pathogens e.g. Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, were also found. At the rejection point, bacteria of Rhodobacteraceae family (52%) and Vibrio spp. (40.2%) dominated at 4 and 10 °C, respectively. TVB-N and TMA-N also increased, reaching higher values at higher storage temperature. The relative concentrations of some VOCs such as 1-octen-3-ol, trans-2-octenal, trans,trans-2,4-heptadienal, 2-butanone, 3-butanone, 2-heptanone, ethyl isobutyrate, ethyl , ethyl-2-methylbutyrate, ethyl isovalerate, hexanoic acid ethyl ester and indole, exhibited an increasing trend during crab storage, making them promising spoilage markers. The composition of microbial communities at different storage temperatures was examined by 16S amplicon meta-barcoding analysis. This kind of analysis in conjugation with the volatile profile can be used to explore the microbiological quality and further assist towards the application of the appropriate strategies to extend crab shelf-life and protect consumer's health.Copyright © 2019.

Abelmoschus manihot (AM) extracted from Flos Abelmoschus manihot that has been applied for treating chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we showed that AM significantly alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice. AM modified gut  composition, increased microbial diversity, and in particularly, elevated the abundance of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing gut  in colitic mice. Consequently, levels of SCFAs especially butyrate and  were increased upon AM treatment, which, primarily through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) pathway, led to the enhanced Treg generation and the suppressed Th17 development. Together, we herein provide the first evidences to support that AM, a natural plant-derived complex, can potentially reset gut microbiome and metabolism, resume immune and tissue homeostasis, and hence prevent colitis, which may provide a new perspective on IBD pathogenesis and suggest a novel -targeting therapy for inflammatory gut diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this longitudinal interventional study, we investigated the impact of DMPA administration on the vaginal microbiome in Hispanic White and Black women at the baseline (visit 1), 1 month (visit 2), and 3 months (visit 3) following DMPA treatment by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. No significant changes in the vaginal microbiome were observed after DMPA treatment when Hispanic White and Black women were analysed as a combined group. However, DMPA treatment enriched total vaginosis-associated bacteria (VNAB) and Prevotella at visit 2, and simplified the correlational network in the vaginal microbiome in Black women, while increasing the network size in Hispanic White women. The microbiome in Black women became more diversified and contained more VNAB than Hispanic White women after DMPA treatment. While the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio and Lactobacillus to Prevotella (L/P) ratio were comparable between Black and Hispanic White women at visit 1, both ratios were lower in Black women than in Hispanic White women at visit 2. In conclusion, DMPA treatment altered the community network and enriched VNAB in Black women but not in Hispanic White women. The Lactobacillus deficiency and enrichment of VNAB may contribute to the increased risk of HIV acquisition in Black women. Future studies on the impact of racial differences on the risk of HIV acquisition will offer insights into developing effective strategies for HIV prevention.

Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-associated disorder with an immune basis and is linked to atopic disorders in offspring. Here we show reduction of fetal thymic size, altered thymic architecture and reduced fetal thymic regulatory T (Treg) cell output in preeclamptic pregnancies, which persists up to 4 years of age in human offspring. In germ-free mice, fetal thymic CD4 T cell and Treg cell development are compromised, but rescued by maternal supplementation with the intestinal bacterial metabolite short chain fatty acid (SCFA) , which induces upregulation of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), known to contribute to Treg cell generation. In our human cohorts, low maternal serum  is associated with subsequent preeclampsia, and correlates with serum  in the fetus.

In colon cancer, treatment with SCFAs, mainly butyrate and propionate, suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, although sodium butyrate is known to induce cell apoptosis in lung cancer, the anticancer effects of sodium propionate (SP) on lung cancer are not well understood. In the present study, SP treatment induced cell cycle arrest, especially in the G2/M phase, and cell apoptosis in the H1299 and H1703 lung cancer cell lines. As determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blotting, Survivin and p21 expression levels were significantly affected by SP treatment, suggesting that SP treatment suppressed cell proliferation in these lung cancer cell lines. Thus, it was proposed that the SP‑mediated regulation of Survivin and p21 in lung cancer may be applicable to lung cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30792016>Synbiotic-driven improvement of metabolic disturbances is associated with changes in the gut microbiome in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>The gut  is an important influencing factor of metabolic health. Although dietary interventions with probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics can be effective means to regulate obesity and associated comorbidities, the underlying shifts in gut microbial communities, especially at the functional level, have not been characterized in great details. In this study, we sought to investigate the effects of synbiotics on the regulation of gut  and the alleviation of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic disorders in mice.Specific pathogen-free (SPF) male C57BL/6J mice were fed diets with either 10% (normal diet, ND) or 60% (high-fat diet, HFD) of total calories from fat (lard). Dietary interventions in the HFD-fed mice included (i) probiotic (Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei DSM 46331), (ii) prebiotic (oat β-glucan), and (iii) synbiotic (a mixture of i and ii) treatments for 12 weeks. Besides detailed characterization of host metabolic parameters, a multi-omics approach was used to systematically profile the microbial signatures at both the phylogenetic and functional levels using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metaproteomics and targeted metabolomics analysis.The synbiotic intervention significantly reduced body weight gain and alleviated features of metabolic complications. At the phylogenetic level, the synbiotic treatment significantly reversed HFD-induced changes in microbial populations, both in terms of richness and the relative abundance of specific taxa. Potentially important species such as Faecalibaculum rodentium and Alistipes putredinis that might mediate the beneficial effects of the synbiotic were identified. At the functional level, short-chain fatty acid and bile acid profiles revealed that all dietary interventions significantly restored cecal levels of , propionate, and butyrate, while the synbiotic treatment reduced the bile acid pools most efficiently. Metaproteomics revealed that the effects of the synbiotic intervention might be mediated through metabolic pathways involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolisms.Our results suggested that dietary intervention using the novel synbiotic can alleviate HFD-induced weight gain and restore gut microbial ecosystem homeostasis phylogenetically and functionally.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The potential immune-improving effects of pectin oligosaccharides (POS) in healthy mice and the potential mechanism mediated by specific intestinal bacteria are investigated.POS is prepared using a hydrogen-peroxide-assisted degradation. Mice that consumed diets containing POS are tested for microbial community shifts, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and immunoglobulin (Ig) production using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, gas chromatography, and ELISA kits. Pearson's correlation analyses are performed between Ig production and specific intestinal bacteria or SCFAs. POS treatment significantly improves the growth of healthy mice. Moreover, 4-week POS administration results in a profound change in intestinal microbial composition and a significantly higher fecal concentration of , which leads to substantial increases of the levels of fecal secretory immunoglobulin A and serum IgG.The results suggest that the inclusion of POS in a diet can increase Ig production and optimize the composition of the gut .

These microorganisms play a very important part in the development, functioning, and modulation of the immune system from the moment of birth. In recent years, owing to the use of modern sequencing techniques, the microbiome composition in healthy people has been identified based on bacterial 16S rRNA analysis. Currently, more and more attention is being given to the influence of microorganisms on the host's cellular metabolism. Analysis of microbial metabolites, among them short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and disruption of intestinal  homeostasis in terms of their effects on molecular regulatory mechanisms of immune reactions will surely improve the understanding of the etiology of many common diseases. SCFAs, mainly butyrate, propionate, and , occur in specific amounts, and their proportions can change, depending on the diet, age and diseases. The levels of SCFAs are substantially influenced by the ratio of commensal intestinal bacteria, the disturbance of which (dysbiosis) can lead to a disproportion between the SCFAs produced. SCFAs are regarded as mediators in the communication between the intestinal microbiome and the immune system. The signal they produce is transferred, among others, in immune cells via free fatty acid receptors (FFARs), which belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It has been also confirmed that SCFAs inhibit the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) - an enzyme involved in post-translational modifications, namely the process of deacetylation and, what is new, the process of histone crotonylation. These properties of SCFAs have an effect on their immunomodulatory potential i.e. maintaining the anti/pro-inflammatory balance. SCFAs act not only locally in the intestines colonized by commensal bacteria, but also influence the intestinal immune cells, and modulate immune response by multi-protein inflammasome complexes. SCFAs have been confirmed to contribute to the maintenance of the immune homeostasis of the urinary system (kidneys), respiratory system (lungs), central nervous system, and the sight organ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30577142>Bioremediation of bezafibrate and paroxetine by microorganisms from estuarine sediment and activated sludge of an associated wastewater treatment plant.</a></h2><p>The present work aimed to explore the potential of autochthonous microorganisms from an urban estuary and from activated sludge of an associated wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), for biodegradation of an antidepressant drug, paroxetine, and on a cholesterol-lowering agent, bezafibrate. These compounds were chosen as representatives of extensively used pharmaceuticals. Autochthonous microorganisms from the indicated sources were exposed to the target pharmaceuticals (1 mg/L) in co-metabolism with sodium  (500 mg/L) along a two-weeks period, for a total of 7 two-weeks periods (here referred as cycles). Exposures were carried out in batch mode, under different incubation conditions (agitation vs. static). Removal of pharmaceuticals was monitored at the end of each cycle, by analysing the culture medium. For paroxetine, fluoride ion release was also followed as an indicator of defluorination of the molecule. The structure of the bacterial communities was analysed by ARISA (Automated rRNA Intergenic Spacer Analysis), at the beginning of the experiment and at the end of the first and the last cycles to identify substantial changes associated with the time of exposure, the incubation conditions and the presence and type of pharmaceuticals. Incubation conditions affected not only the bacterial community structure, but also the biodegradation efficiency. At the beginning of the experiment, removal of target pharmaceuticals was found to be lower under agitation than under static conditions, but at the end of the experiment, results showed high removal of the pharmaceuticals from the culture medium (>97%) under both conditions, mainly by microbiological processes. For paroxetine, adsorption and abiotic processes also had an important influence on its removal, but defluorination only occurred in the presence of microorganisms. These results highlight that autochthonous microorganisms from estuarine sediments and WWTP sludge have high ability to remove the selected pharmaceuticals with relevant implications for the development of new bioremediation tools for environmental restoration.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This lack of specificity limits applications in which biosensors may be deployed, such as those where an unknown feed substrate must be determined. The application of genomic data and well-developed data mining technologies can overcome these limitations and advance engineering development. In the present study, 69 samples with three different substrate types (, carbohydrates and wastewater) collected from various laboratory environments were evaluated to determine the ability to identify feed substrates from the resultant microbial communities. Six machine learning algorithms with four different input variables were trained and evaluated on their ability to predict feed substrate from genomic datasets. The highest accuracies of 93 ± 6% and 92 ± 5% were obtained using NNET trained on datasets classified at the phylum and family taxonomic level, respectively. These accuracies corresponded to kappa values of 0.87 ± 0.10, 0.86 ± 0.09, respectively. Four out of six of the algorithms used maintained accuracies above 80% and kappa values higher than 0.66. Different sequencing method (Roche 454 or Illumina sequencing) did not affect the accuracies of all algorithms, except SVM at the phylum level. All algorithms trained on NMDS-compressed datasets obtained accuracies over 80%, while models trained on PCoA-compressed datasets presented a 10-30% reduction in accuracy. These results suggest that incorporating microbial community data with machine learning algorithms can be used for the prediction of feed substrate and for the potential improvement of MFC-based biosensor signal specificity, providing a new use of machine learning techniques that has substantial practical applications in biotechnological fields.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this cross-sectional study (160 participants, 64% male, BMI: 19.2-41.0 kg/m, normal or impaired glucose metabolism), associations between SCFA (faecal and fasting circulating) and circulating metabolites, substrate oxidation and IS were investigated. In a subgroup (n = 93), IS was determined using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for sex, age and BMI. Fasting circulating , propionate and butyrate concentrations were positively associated with fasting GLP-1 concentrations. Additionally, circulating SCFA were negatively related to whole-body lipolysis (glycerol), triacylglycerols and free fatty acids levels (standardized (std) β adjusted (adj) -0.190, P = 0.023; std β adj -0.202, P = 0.010; std β adj -0.306, P = 0.001, respectively). Circulating  and propionate were, respectively, negatively and positively correlated with IS (M-value: std β adj -0.294, P < 0.001; std β adj 0.161, P = 0.033, respectively). We show that circulating rather than faecal SCFA were associated with GLP-1 concentrations, whole-body lipolysis and peripheral IS in humans.

Increased diversity in the vaginal  modulates genital inflammation and is associated with increased HIV-1 acquisition. However, the effect of MPA on diversity of the vaginal  is relatively unknown. In a cohort of female Kenyan sex workers, negative for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with Nugent scores <7 (=58 of 370 screened), MPA correlated with significantly increased diversity of the vaginal  as assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. MPA was also significantly associated with decreased levels of estrogen in the plasma, and low vaginal glycogen and α-amylase, factors implicated in vaginal colonization by lactobacilli, bacteria that are believed to protect against STIs. In a humanized mouse model, MPA treatment was associated with low serum estrogen, low glycogen and enhanced HIV-1 susceptibility. The mechanism by which the MPA-mediated changes in the vaginal  may contribute to HIV-1 susceptibility in humans appears to be independent of inflammatory cytokines and/or activated T cells. Altogether, these results suggest MPA-induced hypo-estrogenism may alter key metabolic components that are necessary for vaginal colonization by certain bacterial species including lactobacilli, and allow for greater bacterial diversity in the vaginal .This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.© 2019.

Both disorders are worsened during stress, and in laboratory mice, stress exposure has been shown to change the composition of the gut microbiome. Stress-induced changes to the microbiome exacerbate intestinal inflammation and alter intestinal motility in mice. It is, however, not yet known whether -derived short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, and ) and their receptors contribute to this effect.Mice were exposed to a social disruption stress, or left undisturbed as a control. After the first stress exposure, mice were orally challenged with Citrobacter rodentium or with vehicle. The levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. SCFA receptors were measured via real-time polymerase chain reaction. Microbial community composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.Stress exposure reduced colonic SCFA levels. Stress exposure and C rodentium, however, significantly increased SCFA levels and changed the expression of SCFA receptors. The levels of SCFAs did not correlate with the severity of colonic inflammation, but the colonic expression of the SCFA receptor GPR41 was positively associated with inflammatory cytokines and colonic histopathology scores. The relative abundances of several taxa of colonic bacteria were significantly changed by stress exposure, including SCFA producers.Social stress can have a significant effect on infection-induced colonic inflammation, and stress-induced changes in microbial-produced metabolites and their receptors may be involved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30800595>Complete genome sequence of -producing  L5-2 isolated from infant feces.</a></h2><p> is an important metabolite in infants as it can affect metabolism as well as immune and inflammatory responses. However, there have been no studies on  production by  isolated from infant feces. In this study, we isolated a  strain, L5-2, from infant feces, and we found it produces . The genome of L5-2 consisted of a 5,237,123-bp single chromosome and a 139,211-bp single plasmid. The G + C content was 57.27%. By whole-genome analysis of  L5-2, we identified seven genes related to  production (, and ). We confirmed  production by  L5-2 by ion chromatography. The aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase () activity of  L5-2 was significantly higher than that of the  subsp.  ATCC 11296. Thus, the -producing ability of  L5-2 was influenced by the  gene. In addition,  L5-2 had significantly less virulence factor-encoding genes than other  strains isolated from humans. In conclusion,  L5-2 isolated from infant feces has less virulence factors and higher adhE activity than other  strains.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563744>Proteome modifications of gut  in mice with activity-based anorexia and starvation: Role in ATP production.</a></h2><p>Activity-based anorexia (ABA) in rodents is a behavioral model of anorexia nervosa, characterized by negative energy balance, hyperactivity, and dysbiosis of gut . Gut bacteria are known to produce energy substrates including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and . The aim of this study was to determine whether ABA alters the proteome of gut  relevant to ATP and  production.The ABA was developed in male mice and compared with food-restricted and ad libitum-fed conditions. Proteomic analysis of feces was performed using the two-dimentional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The in vitro ATP-producing capacity of proteins extracted from feces was assayed.Increased levels of the phosphoglycerate kinase, an ATP-producing glycolytic enzyme, was detected in feces of food-restricted mice and this enzyme was further increased in the ABA group. Starvation also upregulated several other proteins synthetized by order Clostridiales including Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae families. No significant differences in the in vitro ATP-producing capacity by bacterial proteins from ABA, food-restricted, and ad libitum-fed control mice were found. However, plasma levels of  strongly tended to be increased in the activity groups including ABA mice.The data revealed that starvation in food-restricted and ABA mice induced proteome modification in gut bacteria favoring ATP production mainly by the order Clostridiales. However, this did not result in increased total ATP-production capacity by gut . These changes can be interpreted as an adaptation of specific gut bacteria to the host malnutrition beneficial for host survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Fecal samples ( = 59) were collected every third month from nine patients with ileal Crohn's disease. The abundance of  and  was quantified relative to the total amount of bacteria using quantitative-PCR. To assess butyrate production of gut , gene copy numbers of the butyryl-CoA:-CoA transferase (BCoAT) gene were quantified by qPCR. The inflammatory activity was defined by fecal (f)-calprotectin.  No correlation between the relative abundance of , the  group, or copy numbers of the BCoAT gene, and f-calprotectin was observed in the total sample set. By analyzing alterations between consecutive samples, a negative correlation between changes in the relative abundance of  and f-calprotectin was observed ( = -0.39;  = .009). Changes in  ( = -0.18,  = .23) and number of copies of the BCoAT gene ( = -0.12;  = .42) did not correlate with f-calprotectin.  There was an inverse correlation between temporal changes in the relative abundance of , but not overall butyrate producing capacity, and changes in inflammatory activity in ileal Crohn's disease.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of  biostimulation on TBBPA microbial reductive debromination, and the response of anaerobic sludge associated microbial communities repeatedly exposed to TBBPA. Results indicate that the bulk of the microbial community did not experience significant shifts as a result of TBBPA exposure, and that only a small fraction of the community responded to the presence of TBBPA. Taxa most likely responsible for TBBPA transformation affiliated to Clostridiales and the wastewater sludge group Blvii28. The biostimulating effect of  was only observed during reactor startup, when acetogenesis was likely not yet occurring. However, when  likely started to be microbially generated in the reactor,  addition resulted in a slight but significant inhibiting effect on TBBPA transformation. A significant increase of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the TBBPA-spiked reactor overtime implies that TBBPA degraders were not in direct competition with methanogens for H. These results strongly suggest that TBBPA degrading taxa might have been primarily using  as an electron donor for the reductive debromination of TBBPA.Copyright © 2018.

This longevity extension differs from dietary restriction based on a number of features, including the relatively small effects on weight and the sex-specificity of the lifespan effect. By inhibiting host digestion, acarbose increases the flux of starch to the lower digestive system, resulting in changes to the gut  and their fermentation products. Given the documented health benefits of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the dominant products of starch fermentation by gut bacteria, this secondary effect of acarbose could contribute to increased longevity in mice. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the fecal microbiome of mice treated with acarbose to control mice at three independent study sites.Microbial communities and the concentrations of SCFAs in the feces of mice treated with acarbose were notably different from those of control mice. At all three study sites, the bloom of a single bacterial taxon was the most obvious response to acarbose treatment. The blooming populations were classified to the largely uncultured Bacteroidales family Muribaculaceae and were the same taxonomic unit at two of the three sites. Propionate concentrations in feces were consistently elevated in treated mice, while the concentrations of  and butyrate reflected a dependence on study site. Across all samples, Muribaculaceae abundance was strongly correlated with propionate and community composition was an important predictor of SCFA concentrations. Cox proportional hazards regression showed that the fecal concentrations of , butyrate, and propionate were, together, predictive of mouse longevity even while controlling for sex, site, and acarbose.We observed a correlation between fecal SCFAs and lifespan in mice, suggesting a role of the gut  in the longevity-enhancing properties of acarbose. Treatment modulated the taxonomic composition and fermentation products of the gut microbiome, while the site-dependence of the responses illustrate the challenges facing reproducibility and interpretation in microbiome studies. These results motivate future studies exploring manipulation of the gut microbial community and its fermentation products for increased longevity, testing causal roles of SCFAs in the observed effects of acarbose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618992>Effect of Native and Acetylated Dietary Resistant Starches on Intestinal Fermentative Capacity of Normal and Stunted Children in Southern India.</a></h2><p>The health benefits of dietary amylase resistant starch (RS) arise from intestinal microbial fermentation and generation of short chain fatty acids (SCFA). We compared the intestinal fermentative capability of stunted and nonstunted ('healthy') children in southern India using two types of RS: high amylose maize starch (HAMS) and acetylated HAMS (HAMSA). Twenty children (10 stunted and 10 healthy) aged 2 to 5 years were fed biscuits containing HAMS (10 g/day) for two weeks followed by a 2-week washout and then HAMSA biscuits (10 g/day) for 2 weeks. Fecal samples were collected at 3-4 day intervals and pH and SCFA analyzed. At entry, stunted children had lower SCFA concentrations compared to healthy children. Both types of RS led to a significant decrease in fecal pH and increase in fecal  and propionate in both healthy and stunted children. However, while HAMS increased fecal butyrate in both groups of children, HAMSA increased butyrate in healthy but not stunted children. Furthermore, healthy children showed a significantly greater increase than stunted children in both  and butyrate when fed either RS. No adverse effects were reported with either RS. Stunted children have impaired capacity to ferment certain types of RS which has implications for choice of RS in formulations aimed at improving microbial function in stunted children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498864>Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Short-Chain Fatty Acid Characterization in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Alterations in gut  and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the results are conflicting.

In this process, organics removal (one of the main objectives in sewage treatment) is closely associated with biological sulfate/sulfite reduction (BSR). In the previous studies, both the pros and corns of sulfite (SO) in microbial activities were demonstrated. In this study, we are motivated to unveil the detailed role of SO in organic compound removal in the sulfur conversion-associated process. In addition, the effect of internal recirculation (IR) of UASB reactor was also explored. The results demonstrated that sulfite does inhibit the organic removal rate via depressing the  oxidation to inorganic carbon. And the inhibition is reversible when influent sulfite concentration decreased from 400 to 132 mg S/L, corresponding to the relative sulfate/sulfite-reducing genera increased from 18.66 to 38.62%. And the fermenting-related bacteria significantly decreased when an internal recirculation was employed for the UASB reactor. The results of this study could shed light on the understanding of the roles of sulfite and IR in organic compound removal performance and microbial community structures in BSR, which could be in turn beneficial to optimize the organic removal capacity of the sulfur bionconversion-concerning sewage treatment technology.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Four experimental diets were formulated to include 5% of either fresh canola oil (0 mEq/kg of peroxide value) or oxidized canola oil (180 mEq/kg of peroxide value). An equal portion of each diet was supplemented with 0.1% TA. Eight pigs (initial body weight of 82.89 ± 2.26 kg) were surgically fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum. At the beginning of the experiments, all pigs were fed a nitrogen-free diet for 7 d. Then, they were assigned to 4 dietary treatments according to an incomplete replicated 4 × 3 Latin square design with 3 periods to give 6 replicates per treatment. Each experimental period lasted for 9 d, starting with a 5-d adaptation period followed by 2 consecutive 2-d periods for fecal (day 6 and day 7) and ileal digesta (day 8 and day 9) collection. The inclusion of oxidized oil reduced (P < 0.05) the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of Pro and the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of NDF. Also, pigs fed the oxidized oil tended to have lower (P ≤ 0.10) lactate and ammonia-nitrogen concentrations in the ileum and lower (P ≤ 0.10)  and propionate concentrations in the feces than those fed the fresh oil. The supplementation of 0.1% TA reduced (P < 0.05) the AID of NDF and the ATTD of gross energy, crude protein, and NDF. Additionally, the TA-supplemented diet tended to have a lower (P ≤ 0.10) digestible energy content than the nonsupplemented diet. Pigs fed the TA-supplemented diet showed reduced (P < 0.05) AID and SID of His, Cys, and Pro compared with those fed the nonsupplemented diet. There were interactive effects (P < 0.05) of oxidized oil and TA supplementation on , isovalerate, total short chain fatty acids, and pH level in the ileum. In conclusion, the results indicated that the effects of oxidized oil are greater on microbial activities rather than nutrient digestibility. Although negative effects of dietary TA supplementation were observed in relation to nutrient digestibility, TA supplementation was found to ameliorate these negative effects of oxidized oil on microbial metabolites. Therefore, further studies are required to investigate the interaction between dietary oxidized oil and TA in relation with the gut  in pigs.© The Author(s) 2019.

The metabolomic and biochemistry analyses demonstrated that the PS diet increased (adjusted  < 0.05) the concentrations of organic acids (, propionate, butyrate, valerate, and lactate) and some macronutrients (sugars and long-chain fatty acids), and decreased (adjusted  < 0.05) the amino acids and their derivatives (leucine, glycine, putrescine, cadaverine, skatole, indole, and phenol) when compared with the TS diet. Additionally, Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that the changes in the colonic metabolites were associated with changes in the microbial composition.

Autologous transplantation of fecal  of Ldlr mice served as control. Mice were cohoused for 8 or 13 weeks and fed chow or high-fat cholesterol-rich diet. Fecal samples were collected, and factors related to inflammation, metabolism, intestinal health, and atherosclerotic phenotypes were measured. Unweighted Unifrac distances of 16S rDNA (ribosomal DNA) sequences confirmed the introduction of the Casp1 and Ldlr  into Ldlr mice (referred to as Ldlr( Casp1) or Ldlr( Ldlr) mice). Analysis of atherosclerotic lesion size in the aortic root demonstrated a significant 29% increase in plaque size in 13-week high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) mice compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. We found increased numbers of circulating monocytes and neutrophils and elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels in plasma in high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. Neutrophil accumulation in the aortic root of Ldlr( Casp1) mice was enhanced compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. 16S-rDNA-encoding sequence analysis in feces identified a significant reduction in the short-chain fatty acid-producing taxonomies Akkermansia, Christensenellaceae, Clostridium, and Odoribacter in Ldlr( Casp1) mice.

An enrichment process with 1 mgL of ENR was conducted during ca. 9 months, using  as a co-substrate. After this, the enriched microbial consortia were challenged with higher ENR concentrations of 2 and 3 mgL. Microbial cultures enriched with 1 mgL of ENR were capable of biodegrading this antibiotic, though not completely. By the end of the enrichment phase, microbial cultures were defluorinating an average of 50% of the ENR supplemented. Higher ENR concentrations led to lower biodegradation performances, suggesting a possible toxic/inhibitory effect in the microbial cultures. Phylogenetic identification of the microorganisms isolated from microbial cultures enriched with ENR revealed a high taxonomical diversity, with microorganisms belonging mainly to Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla. Assemblage of the obtained isolated strains (according to the enriched cultures from which they were isolated) revealed that the resulting consortia were also capable of degrading ENR, indicating that the main microbial players in the biodegradation of this antibiotic were isolated. These consortia also showed to be more robust to degrade higher concentrations of ENR than the corresponding enriched cultures. This study shows that microorganisms derived from rhizosediments of the selected plants, exhibit capacity to biodegrade ENR, though not completely for the concentrations tested, and may be further explored for the development of bioremediation strategies for the treatment of this antibiotic.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We fed hybrid pigs diets supplemented with 0% (control), 5% (treat 1), 10% (treat 2), or 15% (treat 3) fermented Mao-tai lees (FML) for 90 days. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bioamines, and microbial communities found in colonic contents were analyzed to investigate  composition and metabolic profiles. Concentrations of straight-chain fatty acids (e.g., , propionate, and butyrate) and tyramine increased with FML supplementation content. Contrary to the minor effects of 5% and 10% FML on gut , 15% FML influenced beta diversity (Jaccard or Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) but not alpha diversity (number of operational taxonomic units and Shannon diversity) of pig gut microbial communities compared to the control group. Notably, 15% FML animals were characterized by a higher abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus and Akkermansia) but lower abundances of potential pathogens (Escherichia). Numerous genes associated with metabolism (e.g., starch, sucrose, and sulfur-compounds metabolism) showed a higher relative abundance in the 15% FML than in the control group. Additionally, most Phascolarctobacterium, Treponema, Prevotella, and Faecalibacterium bacterial markers in the 15% FML group were positively correlated with straight-chain fatty acid concentrations, suggesting that these bacteria are likely associated with SCFA production. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the beneficial effects of 15% FML on fermentation of undigested compounds and gut  composition in the colon. Thus, 15% FML supplementation in pig feed may possibly represent a way to optimize pig colon health for livestock farming.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30555441>Comparative Microbiome Signatures and Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Mouse, Rat, Non-human Primate, and Human Feces.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiome plays a fundamental role in several aspects of host health and diseases. There has been an exponential surge in the use of animal models that can mimic different phenotypes of the human intestinal ecosystem. However, data on host species-specific signatures of gut microbiome and its metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; i.e., , propionate, and butyrate) and lactate in these models and their similarities/differences from humans remain limited, due to high variability in protocols and analyses. Here, we analyze the fecal  composition and the fecal levels of SCFAs and lactate in three of the most-widely used animal models, i.e., mice, rats, and non-human primates (NHPs) and compare them with human subjects, using data generated on a single platform with same protocols. The data show several species-specific similarities and differences in the gut  and fecal organic acids between these species groups. Based on β-diversity, the gut  in humans seems to be closer to NHPs than to mice and rats; however, among rodents, mice  appears to be closer to humans than rats.

Mouse gut is predominated by members of the family  followed by those from the order , whereas rats and NHPs have higher abundance of  compared with mice and humans. Also, fecal levels of lactate are higher in mice and rats vs. NHPs and humans, while  is highest in human feces. These data of host species-specific gut  signatures in some of the most widely used animal models in context to the human  might reflect disparities in host factors, e.g., diets, genetic origin, gender and age, and hence call for prospective studies investigating the features of gut microbiome in such animal models by controlling for these host elements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30904293>Invited review: Plant polyphenols and rumen  responsible for fatty acid biohydrogenation, fiber digestion, and methane emission: Experimental evidence and methodological approaches.</a></h2><p>The interest of the scientific community in the effects of plant polyphenols on animal nutrition is increasing. These compounds, in fact, are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, especially in some spontaneous plants exploited as feeding resources alternative to cultivated crops and in several agro-industry by-products. Polyphenols interact with rumen , affecting carbohydrate fermentation, protein degradation, and lipid metabolism. Some of these aspects have been largely reviewed, especially for tannins; however, less information is available about the direct effect of polyphenols on the composition of rumen . In the present paper, we review the most recent literature about the effect of plant polyphenols on rumen  responsible for unsaturated fatty acid biohydrogenation, fiber digestion, and methane production, taking into consideration the advances in  analysis achieved in the last 10 yr. Key aspects, such as sample collection, sample storage, DNA extraction, and the main phylogenetic markers used in the reconstruction of microbial community structure, are examined. Furthermore, a summary of the new high-throughput methods based on next generation sequencing is reviewed. Several effects can be associated with dietary polyphenols. Polyphenols are able to depress or modulate the biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids by a perturbation of ruminal  composition. In particular, condensed tannins have an inhibitory effect on biohydrogenation, whereas hydrolyzable tannins seem to have a modulatory effect on biohydrogenation. With regard to fiber digestion, data from literature are quite consistent about a general depressive effect of polyphenols on gram-positive fibrolytic bacteria and ciliate protozoa, resulting in a reduction of volatile fatty acid production (mostly  molar production). Methane production is also usually reduced when tannins are included in the diet of ruminants, probably as a consequence of the inhibition of fiber digestion. However, some evidence suggests that hydrolyzable tannins may reduce methane emission by directly interacting with rumen  without affecting fiber digestion.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Our recent study showed that the low-birth-weight (LBW) piglets harbored a different fecal  compared to normal-birth-weight (NBW) piglets during early life with a lower abundance of the genus . Considering the spatial variations in gut  at distinct gut locations, this study was designed to further investigate the differences in the  composition and predominant  species in the ileum and colon between LBW and NBW piglets during early life, including day 7 (D7), day 21 (D21, before weaning), and day 35 (D35, 2 weeks after weaning). Compared with the normal group, LBW piglets harbored a significantly lower proportion of short-chain fatty acids producing microbes, such as Ruminococcaceae and Prevotellaceae in the ileum on D7,  and Lachnospiraceae in the colon on D7,  in the colon on D21, and  in the colon on D35. The relative abundance of the phylum Bacteroidetes was also declined in both ileum and colon of LBW piglets on D7. Meanwhile, the levels of total SCFAs on D7, D21, and D35,  and valerate on D7 and D21, propionate on D21, and lactate on D21 and D35, were also declined in the colon of LBW piglets. Moreover, functional alterations in the gut  of LBW piglets were characterized by differentially abundant microbial genes involved in multiple pathways such as amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, replication and repair, and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins in the colon. Additionally, lower numbers of  on D7 and  on D21 resided in the colon of LBW piglets compared to those in the normal ones. Collectively, LBW piglets have altered bacterial communities, microbial metabolism and gene functions in the ileum and colon during early life, especially the colonic community. This work will help to develop novel ideas in identifying the reliable biomarkers affecting the gut  development in LBW piglets during early life and facilitate the development of new nutritional interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179713>Gut  development of preterm infants hospitalised in intensive care units.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiome development affects infant health and postnatal physiology. The gut microbe assemblages of preterm infants have been reported to be different from that of healthy term infants. However, the patterns of ecosystem development and inter-individual differences remain poorly understood. We investigated hospitalised preterm infant gut  development using 16S rRNA gene amplicons and the metabolic profiles of 268 stool samples obtained from 17 intensive care and 42 term infants to elucidate the dynamics and equilibria of the developing . Infant gut  were predominated by Gram-positive cocci,  or , which showed sequential transitions to -dominated . In neonatal intensive care unit preterm infants (NICU preterm infants),  abundance was higher immediately after birth than in healthy term infants, and  colonisation tended to be delayed. No specific NICU-cared infant enterotype-like cluster was observed, suggesting that the constrained environment only affected the pace of transition, but not infant gut  equilibrium. Moreover, infants with -dominated  showed higher  concentrations and lower pH, which have been associated with host health. Our data provides an in-depth understanding of gut  development in NICU preterm infants and complements earlier studies. Understanding the patterns and inter-individual differences of the preterm infant gut ecosystem is the first step towards controlling the risk of diseases in premature infants by targeting intestinal .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30973755>Dynamic changes in rumen fermentation and bacterial community following rumen fluid transplantation in a sheep model of rumen acidosis: implications for rumen health in ruminants.</a></h2><p>Over the years, rumen fluid transplantation (RT) has been successfully applied to treat acute rumen acidosis in ruminants, but how it functions in the ruminal microbial homeostasis and host function remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the dynamic changes of rumen fermentation and bacterial communities following RT and its beneficial effects on rumen epithelial morphology and function in a sheep model of rumen acidosis. The results showed that RT resulted in dynamic changes in rumen fermentation and increased the concentrations of total volatile fatty acid, , propionate, and butyrate, but it decreased the levels of lactate and LPS in the rumen. Illumina MiSeq Sequencing data showed that RT facilitated rapid rebuilt of ruminal bacterial homeostasis (8 d in control  2 d in RT) from a markedly dysbiotic acidosis state to a healthy level (similar with those of donors). At the genus level, RT increased the relative abundance of unclassified , unclassified , unclassified , and . Additionally, RT also accelerated recovery of the predicted metagenomic function of ruminal bacteria. Rumen papillae morphology results showed that RT alleviated the damage of rumen epithelia induced by acute rumen acidosis and increased the length of rumen papillae. Furthermore, real-time PCR results showed that RT modulated mRNA expression of genes related to cytokines and tight junctions in the rumen epithelia. In summary, these results reveal that RT accelerates recovery of rumen fermentation and bacterial homeostasis and modulates rumen epithelial morphology and function for sheep suffering from rumen acidosis.-Liu, J., Li, H., Zhu, W., Mao, S.

Results showed that methane production was increased by maximum 16.1%, and magnetite could enhance the acetoclastic methanogenesis not hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis reflected by the functional gene quantification and microbial community analysis. The propionate degradation rate was improved, and it was syntrophic oxidized into H/e/CO for direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) and , where DIET was further enhanced by magnetite and the  was transformed into methane through syntrophic  oxidation (SAO) pathway. Magnetite mainly influenced the ARGs at the interim period of AD, where ARGs especially ermF were significantly enriched. Magnetite did not influence the total ARGs abundance at the end, although the tetM was enriched and mefA was reduced finally. Statistical analysis indicated that magnetite influenced the ARGs fate mainly through the changes of microbial community.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Clustering by gut  revealed the existence of two communities mainly driven by diet as host properties showed little effect. Community 1 presented lower richness and diversity, but higher dominance and rarity of species, including some pathobionts. Moreover, its  composition was tightly linked to host blood metabolites related to lipid metabolism and glycolysis at basal time. Despite the lower fiber intake, community type 1 appeared more specialized to produce  as a mean of maintaining the energy supply as glucose concentrations fell during the race. On the other hand, community type 2 showed an enrichment of fibrolytic and cellulolytic bacteria as well as anaerobic fungi, coupled to a higher production of propionate and butyrate. The higher butyrate proportion in community 2 was not associated with protective effects on telomere lengths but could have ameliorated mucosal inflammation and oxidative status. The gut  was neither associated with the blood biochemical markers nor metabolome during the endurance race, and did not provide a biomarker for race ranking or risk of failure to finish the race.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30500495>Effects of Schisandra chinensis polysaccharides on rats with antibiotic-associated diarrhea.</a></h2><p>Schisandra chinensis (S. chinensis), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is comprised of polysaccharides as its main active component. In this study, water-soluble polysaccharides from S. chinensis (WSP) were extracted, and their effects on rats with antibiotic-associated diarrhea were investigated. The rats were treated with lincomycin hydrochloride, followed by saline (natural recovery [NR] group) or WSP (WSP group). The body weight and water intake of rats were analyzed, as well as histological data. Other experiments involving a measurement of cytokine levels, 16s rRNA sequencing analysis of caecal contents, and a measurement of the concentration of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were also performed. Compared to rats of the NR group, WSP decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the ileum and colon; decreased the levels of IL-4, IL-17A and TNF-α; increased the serum IL-2 and IL-10 levels; increased the relative abundance of Blautia, Intestinibacter and Lachnospiraceae-UCG-008, but decreased the relative abundance of Ruminococcus-1, Ruminococcaceae-UCG-014 and Erysipelatoclostridium at the genus level; and significantly increased the contents of total SCFAs,  and propionate. In conclusion, WSP affected rats with antibiotic-associated diarrhea by improving the ultrastructure of the gut, adjusting cytokine levels and modifying the gut microbial community and SCFAs production.Copyright © 2018.

The present study identified 60 volatile compounds, 23 amino acids, and seven organic acids during the traditional brewing of Monascus vinegar. Acetic acid, alanine, alcohols, esters, lactic acid, and valine were the predominant metabolic compounds found during the fermentation process. Komagataeibacter medellinensis, Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Sterigmatomyces halophilus, and Yarrowia lipolytica were the dominant microorganisms during the traditional brewing of Monascus vinegar. Furthermore, based on Spearman's correlation analysis, K. medellinensis showed a positive correlation with acetic acid, acetoin, benzaldehyde, phenethyl , 4-ethylphenol, proline, threonine, and isoleucine. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was positively associated with the production of acetoin, benzeneacetaldehyde, 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, proline, threonine, and isoleucine. Bacillus velezensis and Yarrowia lipolytica were positively correlated with esters and alcohols, implying that these microorganisms might make a significant contribution to the flavor of vinegar. These findings demonstrated that some microorganisms may play important roles in improving the aromatic quality of Monascus vinegar.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Gut  may play a regulatory role in gastrointestinal health, substrate metabolism, and peripheral tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver, and pancreas via its metabolites short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Animal and human data demonstrated that, in particular,  beneficially affects host energy and substrate metabolism via secretion of the gut hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY, which, thereby, affects appetite, via a reduction in whole-body lipolysis, systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and via an increase in energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Thus, potential therapies to increase gut microbial fermentation and  production have been under vigorous scientific scrutiny. In this review, the relevance of the colonically and systemically most abundant SCFA  and its effects on the previously mentioned tissues will be discussed in relation to body weight control and glucose homeostasis. We discuss in detail the differential effects of oral  administration (vinegar intake), colonic  infusions, acetogenic fiber, and acetogenic probiotic administrations as approaches to combat obesity and comorbidities. Notably, human data are scarce, which highlights the necessity for further human research to investigate 's role in host physiology, metabolic, and cardiovascular health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094471>Markers of dysbiosis in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to study the taxonomic and functional composition of the gut  in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients to identify key markers of dysbiosis in IBD.Fecal samples obtained from 95 IBD patients (78 UC and 17 CD) as well as 96 healthy volunteers were used for whole-genome sequencing carried out on the SOLiD 5500 W platform. Taxonomic profiling was performed by aligning the reeds, not maped on hg19, on MetaPhlAn2 reference database. Reeds were mapped using the HUNAnN2 algorithm to the ChocoPhlAn database to assess the representation of microbial metabolic pathways. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) level were measured in fecal samples by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis.Changes in IBD patients gut  were characterized by an increase in the representation of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla bacteria and decrease in the number of Firmicutes phylum bacteria and Euryarchaeota phylum archaea; a decrease in the alpha-diversity index, relative representation of butyrate-producing, hydrogen-utilizing bacteria, and Methanobrevibacter smithii; increase in the relative representation of Ruminococcus gnavus in UC and CD patients and Akkermansia muciniphila in CD patients. Reduction of Butyryl-CoA:  CoA transferase gene relative representation in CD patients, decrease of absolute content of SCFA total number as well as particular SCFAs and main SCFAs ratio in IBD patients may indicate inhibition of functional activity and number of anaerobic microflora and/or an change in SCFA utilization by colonocytes.the revealed changes can be considered as typical signs of dysbiosis in IBD patients and can be used as potential targets for IBD patients personalized treatment development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31252317>Unraveling interactive characteristics of microbial community associated with bioelectric energy production in sludge fermentation fluid-fed microbial fuel cells.</a></h2><p>This first-attempt study deciphered the interactive characteristics of anodophilic microbial community-associated bioelectricity production in waste activated sludge (WAS) fermentation fluid-fed microbial fuel cells (MFCs). A novel schematic elucidation for illustrating synergistic interactions in anodic microbial consortia towards electrogenesis was proposed. Moreover, the specific genera of Pseudomonas, Desulfovibrio, Phyllobacterium, Desulfuromonas, Chelatococcus and Aminivibrio were dominant in anodic biofilms, leading to an electrogenesis efficiency of 1.254 kWh/kg COD and peak power density of 0.182 W/m (at feeding level of 1.20 g COD/L). It was apparently higher than those MFCs fed with glucose/. The fermentative species contributed positively in reorganizing microbial community structure in anodic biofilms, positively relating to electrogenesis via interactions with exoeletrogens in MFCs. Finally, a more electrogenesis was positively associated to larger anodic microbial diversity, relatively medium anodic community evenness, together with higher abundance of functional genes related to electrogenesis in functional species in MFCs fed with WAS fermentation fluid.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
