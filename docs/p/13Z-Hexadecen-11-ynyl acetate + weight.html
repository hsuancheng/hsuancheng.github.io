However, data on breast milk composition and its relation with growth are sparse.We investigated whether short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), known to be present in HM and linked to energy metabolism, are associated with infancy anthropometrics.In a prospective birth cohort, HM hindmilk samples were collected from 619 lactating mothers at 4-8 wk postnatally [median (IQR) age: 33.9 (31.3-36.5) y,  mass index (BMI) (kg/m2): 22.8 (20.9-25.2)]. Their offspring, born at 40.1 (39.1-41.0) wk gestation with  3.56 (3.22-3.87) kg and 51% male, were assessed with measurement of , length, and skinfold thickness at ages 3, 12, and 24 mo, and transformed to age- and sex-adjusted z scores. HM SCFAs were measured by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and GC-MS. Multivariable linear regression models were conducted to analyze the relations between NMR HM SCFAs and infancy growth parameters with adjustment for potential confounders.NMR peaks for HM butyrate, , and formic acid, but not propionate, were detected. Butyrate peaks were 17.8% higher in HM from exclusively breastfeeding mothers than mixed-feeding mothers (P = 0.003). HM butyrate peak values were negatively associated with changes in infant  (standardized B  = -0.10, P = 0.019) and BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) between 3 and 12 mo, and negatively associated with BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) and mean skinfold thickness (B = -0.10, P = 0.049) at age 12 mo. HM formic acid peak values showed a consistent negative association with infant BMI at all time points (B < = -0.10, P < = 0.014), whereas HM  was negatively associated with skinfold thickness at 3 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.028) and 24 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.036).These results suggest that HM SCFAs play a beneficial role in  gain and adiposity during infancy. Further knowledge of HM SCFA function may inform future strategies to support healthy growth.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31228449>Inhibitory effects of 7,7'-bromo-curcumin on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13--induced skin inflammation.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to determine the capacity of 7,7'-bromo-curcumin (CUR-Br), a curcumin analogue with higher chemical stability than curcumin (CUR), in the suppression of mouse ear edema. Male CD-1 mice were topically pre-treated with either CUR or CUR-Br for 30 min prior to an application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-. After 6 h, mice were killed, and ear punches were measured for their  and thickness as a marker of edema and inflammation. CUR-Br demonstrated a higher anti-inflammatory efficacy compared to CUR. CUR and CUR-Br at 1.0 μmol suppressed the TPA-induced increase in the ear  by 26.0% and 57.2%, and decreased TPA-induced increase in the ear thickness by 22.2% and 84.7%, respectively. The inhibitory effects of Cur-Br were associated with decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, KC/GRO, IL-10, IL-17, and IL-23). In addition, CUR-Br significantly downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory signaling proteins such as p-STAT3, STAT3, PI3K, AKT, p-p65, and COX-2. Overall, our results demonstrated that the curcumin analogue, CUR-Br, showed stronger anti-inflammatory properties than CUR in inhibiting TPA-induced inflammatory response in mouse skin.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the first study, four women who presented late in their cycle and desired avoiding vaginal bleeding within 10 days before a wedding were started on norethindrone 5 mg three times daily and compared to age matched controls started on OCPs. Subsequently, a randomized controlled pilot study (n = 50) comparing OCPs to norethindrone for the retiming of menses was conducted. Percentage of women reporting spotting were compared with level of statistical significance set at p < 0.05.Of the norethindrone treated group, only 2 women (8%) reported spotting compared with 10 women (43%) in the control group (p < 0.01). Norethindrone recipients experienced significant  gain, which resolved after cessation of therapy and had heavier withdrawal bleed (p < 0.04) when compared to controls. Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in the norethindrone group, with 80% willing to choose this method again. Time to conceive was significantly shorter in the norethindrone group (p < 0.03).Norethindrone, begun on or before cycle day 12, is superior for women who desire to avoid breakthrough bleeding and maintain fertility when compared to OCPs. It is an ideal approach in patients presenting late in their cycle and who desire delaying menses as well as in circumstances when even minute amounts of breakthrough bleeding cannot be tolerated.Clinicaltrials.gov  , July 2018.

Extract on Neurodegeneration Improvement: Ameliorating Role in Cognitive Disorder Caused by High-Fat Diet Induced Obesity.</a></h2><p>This study was performed to estimate the possibility of using an ethyl  fraction from  var.  (EFAD) on metabolic syndrome that is induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). It was demonstrated that EFAD suppresses lipid accumulation and improves insulin resistance (IR) caused by Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in  experiments using the 3T3-L1 cell. In  tests, C57BL/6 mice were fed EFAD at 20 and 40 mg/kg  (BW) for four weeks after the mice were fed HFD for 15 weeks to induce obesity. EFAD significantly suppressed the elevation of BW and improved impaired glucose tolerance in obese mice. Additionally, this study showed that EFAD has an ameliorating effect on obesity-induced cognitive disorder with behavioral tests. The effect of EFAD on peripheral-IR improvement was confirmed by serum analysis and western blotting in peripheral tissues. Additionally, EFAD showed an ameliorating effect on HFD-induced oxidative stress, impaired cholinergic system and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are interrelated symptoms of neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease and central nervous system (CNS)-IR in brain tissue. Furthermore, we confirmed that EFAD improves CNS-IR by confirming the IR-related factors in brain tissue. Consequently, this study suggests the possibility of using EFAD for the prevention of neurodegeneration by improving metabolic syndrome that is caused by HFD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760672>Effect of Oat and Tartary Buckwheat - Based Food on Cholesterol - Lowering and Gut Microbiota in Hypercholesterolemic Hamsters.</a></h2><p>The nutritional components in oat and tartary buckwheat had been assessed to have cholesterollowering effects. However, The effect of oat and tartary buckwheat based-food (OF) on cholesterol-lowering and gut microbiota in hypercholesterole hamsters was still limited studied because they are usually consumed in whole gran as well as after being processed. In this study, normal diets, high fat diet (HFD) with/without OF were fed to hamsters for 30 days respectively and growth parameters, metabolic parameters, and gut microbiota were investigated, respectively. It was found that OF significantly decreased plasma total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol), lowered liver TC, cholesterol ester (CE), and triglycerides (TG) concentrations, and increased fecal  and bile acids (BA) concentrations, compared with HFD (p < 0.05). Moreover, the concentrations of , propionate, butyrate and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were significantly increased in hamsters fed with OF, compared with HFD (p < 0.05). OF changed the overall structure of gut microbiota. The relative abundances of Erysipelotrichaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae were decreased and the relative abundance of Eubacteriaceae was increased, compared with HFD. These results suggested that OF could reduce the concentrations of plasma lipid by inhibiting cholesterol absorption in liver and promoting excretions of fecal lipid and BA. And it also increased SCFAs and modulated the gut microbiota effectively to exert the hypocholesterolemic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303586>In vitro and in vivo anti-arthritic evaluation of Polystichum braunii to validate its folkloric claim.</a></h2><p>Medicinal plants are playing an imperative role in the therapy for treating various chronic ailments including arthritis. The present study was focused on finding in-vitro and in-vivo anti-arthritic potential of P. braunii roots. In vitro protein denaturation, membrane stabilization and anti-trypsinase assays were carried out to demonstrate anti-arthritic activity of the extracts. Furthermore, the extracts exerting promising in vitro anti-arthritic potential were tested orally at 150, 300 and 600mg/kg/day against formaldehyde induced arthritis in Wistar rats. The methanolic, aqueous and ethyl  extracts of the plant revealed noteworthy in vitro anti-arthritic activities while mitigating formaldehyde induced paw edema in dose dependent manner. Methanolic and aqueous extracts showed the highest inhibition (p<0.05) of paw edema, arthritic indices, reduced elevated level of platelets and leukocytes while increasing hemoglobin and  of arthritic rats. Anti-arthritic activity of the plant extracts may be due to inhibition of protein denaturation and lysosomal membrane stabilization. The plant exhibited good anti-arthritic potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591297>Biological Evaluation of Natural and Synthesized Homovanillic Acid Esters as Inhibitors of Intestinal Fatty Acid Uptake in Differentiated Caco-2 Cells.</a></h2><p>With raising prevalence of obesity, the regulation of human  fat is increasingly relevant. The modulation of fatty acid uptake by enterocytes represents a promising target for  maintenance. Recent results demonstrated that the trigeminal active compounds capsaicin, nonivamide, and -pellitorine dose-dependently reduce fatty acid uptake in differentiated Caco-2 cells as a model for the intestinal barrier. However, non-pungent alternatives have not been investigated and structural determinants for the modulation of intestinal fatty acid uptake have not been identified so far. Thus, based on the previous results, we synthesized 23 homovanillic acid esters in addition to the naturally occurring capsiate and screened them for their potential to reduce intestinal fatty acid uptake using the fluorescent fatty acid analog Bodipy-C12 in differentiated Caco‑2 cells as an enterocyte model. Whereas pre-incubation with 100 µM capsiate did not change fatty acid uptake by Caco-2 enterocytes, a maximum inhibition of -47% was reached using 100 µM 1‑methylpentyl-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl). Structural analysis of the 24 structural analogues tested in the present study revealed that a branched fatty acid side chain, independent of the chain length, is one of the most important structural motifs associated with inhibition of fatty acid uptake in Caco-2 enterocytes. The results of the present study may serve as an important basis for designing potent dietary inhibitors of fatty acid uptake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872874>Calorimetric studies of interactions between low molecular  salts and bovine serum albumin in water at H values below and above the isoionic point.</a></h2><p>Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to determine the temperature and salt concentration dependence of the enthalpy of mixing, Δ , of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in aqueous buffer solutions with several low molecular  salts. Three buffers were used:  (H = 4.0), MOPS (7.2), and borate (9.2). Since the isoionic point of BSA is at I ≈ 4.7, the net charge of BSA in  buffer was positive (≈ +20), while in the other two buffer solutions it was negative (≈ -15 in MOPS and ≈ -25 in borate). The majority of the recorded heat effects were exothermic, while only at H = 9.2 a weak endothermic effect upon mixing BSA with LiCl, NaCl, and KCl was observed. For all buffer solutions the absolute values of Δ  of sodium salts followed the order: NaCl < NaBr < NaNO < NaI < NaSCN, which is the reverse Hofmeister series for anions. The magnitude of the effects was the largest in  buffer and decreased with an increasing H value of the solution. While the effect of varying the anion of the added salts was strongly pronounced at all H values, the effect of the cation (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, RbCl and CsCl salts) was weak. The most interesting feature of the results obtained for H > I was the fact that Δ  were considerably more sensitive to the anion (co-ion to the net BSA charge) than to the cation species. This indicated that anions interacted quite strongly with the BSA even at H values where the net charge of the protein was negative. We showed that Δ  at high addition of salts correlated well with the enthalpy of hydration of the corresponding salt anion. This finding suggested, consistently with some previous studies, that a part of the exothermic contribution to Δ  originated from the hydration changes upon the protein-salt interaction. Theoretical analysis, based on the primitive model of highly asymmetric electrolyte solutions solved within the mean spherical approximation, was used to estimate Coulomb effects upon mixing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31205861>Safety effect of fractions from methanolic leaf extract of  on reproduction in male wistar rats.</a></h2><p>This study evaluates the reproductive toxicity of ethyl  and butanolic fractions from crude methanolic leaf extract of  in male Wistar rats. Acute toxicity was assessed to determine the safety dose, Sub-chronic reproductive toxicity studies were carried out by administering daily 25, 100 and 400 mg/kg  doses of the fractions to respective group of animals and 1 ml of normal saline daily for the control group for 28 days. Blood, epididymis and testes were harvested for reproductive hormones, sperm parameters, and histopathologic analysis respectively. There was significant (P < 0.05) increase in serum levels of testosterone,  gain, sperm count. There was also apparent increase in mean-testicular  and preservation of testicular histology with increase spermatogenesis in both the ethyl  and butanolic fraction treated groups compared with control. Serum levels of luteinising hormone was however significantly (P < 0.05) decrease across the groups compared to control. These effects were more pronounced in the butanolic fraction group compared to the ethyl  treated group. Sperm motility was also significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the ethyl  treated group compared to control. Findings from this studies demonstrate that these fractions were non-toxic at the tested doses with regards to male reproduction but, rather, exhibited fertility enhancing effects which was better with the butanolic fraction. Our findings also shows that the ethyl  fraction may be safer than the butanolic fraction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656995>Epoxidation is the preferred pathway of first-stage metabolism of abiraterone  in brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus).</a></h2><p>Twenty juvenile individuals of brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), average  77 g, were fed by abiraterone  prodrug dissolved in olive oil via gastric probe. Dose applied was 3 mg/10 g fish . After feeding, they were let out into aquarium and kept there for 3 days.

The bioemulsifier was column-purified and the chemical nature of the compound was elucidated using FT-IR, GC-MS and 1D [H andC] and 2D NMR. This monorhamnolipid is extracted from a bacterium, Pseudomonas guganensis and is not reported to have biological activities, let alone emulsification abilities. The bacterium continually produced rhamnolipids when nourished with n-hexadecane as its lone carbon source. The extracellularly secreted monorhamnolipids are capable of degrading hydrocarbons, with most preference to n-hexadecane [EI of 56 ± 1.42% by 2 mL of the spent medium]. Whilst the crude ethyl  partitioned extract had an EI of 65 ± 1.43%; the purified rhamnolipid product showed 78 ± 1.75% both at 12.5 mg/mL concentration. The used-up n-hexadecane is biotransformed to prepare its own rhamnolipids which in return is utilized to degrade n-alkanes thus creating a circular pathway which is proposed herein. This bacterium can be seen as a new source of bioemulsifier to reduce hydrocarbon in polluted waters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384826>Thermodynamic pathway of lignocellulosic acetylation process.</a></h2><p>The use of natural cellulosic fibers as materials in the reinforcements of polymer composites and sorption of oil from water, has directed more focus on acetylation than other known chemical modification methods. Cellulose can be modified by acetylation to provide a suitable and cost effective cellulose  which have high hydrophobic characteristics and are biodegradable. In this study, lignocellulosic samples-oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB), pride of Barbados pods (POBP) and cocoa pods (CP)-with different compositions of lignin and hemicellulose, were acetylated using solvent free method. Effect of temperature on the acetylation of these samples at different reaction times were studied and used for the thermodynamic studies. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the significance of temperature variation with  percent gain (WPG) due to acetylation of the lignocellulosics at different reaction times. FTIR studies showed evidence of successful acetylation reaction. ANOVA test showed no statistical difference in the observed variation of WPG due to acetylation of all the lignocellulosic samples, with temperature at different reaction times. The best acetylating period for OPEFB, POBP and CP were 60, 30 and 90 min respectively. Acetylation of the lignocellulosic samples were found to occur by absorbing heat from the environment. Values of entropy changes were positive while Gibb's free energy change values were negative except at operating temperature of 303 K. Thus, acetylation of these lignocellulosic samples were spontaneous except at 303 K. Acetylated POBP has the lowest heat capacity (0.82 kJ mol K) compared to acetylated OPEFB (1.47 kJ mol K) and CP (1.15 kJ mol K). Low critical WPG showed that the mechanism of acetylating these materials were diffusion controlled. The critical temperatures of OPEFB, POBP and CP acetylation were found to be 282.6 K, 223.2 K and 260.5 K respectively. Thus, acetylation of these lignocellulosic samples were successful and found to be energy efficient.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491645>The effects of short-term medroxyprogesterone  on rut related behaviors, semen characteristics and fertility in farmed reindeer bulls.</a></h2><p>The effects of medroxyprogesterone  (MPA) on velvet antler cleaning, hypophagia, aggressive behavior and fertility were evaluated in farmed reindeer bulls during a 2-year study. Eight reindeer bulls aged 1-4 years were divided into 2 groups balanced for age. During each year, one group (MPA, n = 4) was treated with MPA 2 wk prior to the expected onset of rut while the other group (CTL, n = 4) served as untreated controls. Feed consumption, behavior and antler cleaning were recorded daily or 3 x weekly for 3 mo. Each year a dominant CTL and MPA bull were put into separate harems of estrous synchronized females for 1 wk in mid-September. Following harem breakup, semen was collected from all bulls via electroejaculation and evaluated. In Year 2 the bulls were switched such that year 1 MPA bulls received the CTL treatment and year 1 CTL bulls received MPA treatment. In Year 2 all eight bulls received MPA treatment/booster following semen collection. In both years, MPA treatment reduced rut associated  loss (p ≤ 0.05), rut associated hypophagia (p ≤ 0.001), interfered with velvet antler cleaning, and abolished aggressive rut related behavior. All of these changes suggest suppression of testosterone mediated effects. Alternatively, semen parameters differed little between treatment groups with the exception of reduced sperm concentration and total sperm production in MPA bulls (p ≤ 0.05). All CTL bulls in Year 2 exhibited full rut behavior with the dominant bull successfully breeding 100% of females available for breeding, suggesting no carryover effect of MPA treatment from the previous year. The MPA bull successfully bred 4 of 6 females (Year 1) but the MPA bull in Year 2 failed to sire any offspring. A single 400 mg treatment of MPA just prior to rut was sufficient to suppress rut associated aggression and hypophagia on a short-term (3 mo) basis. It did not however, completely suppress fertility.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Ethyl  was the best organic solvent to elute out the potential compound responsible for antimicrobial activity. Diterpenes were the most abundant phytoconstituent (15.3%) and showed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity ranging from 16.66 to 42.66 mm. Ethyl  extract displayed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (0.05-1 mg/mL), followed by diterpenes (0.05-5 mg/mL) and flavonoids (0.05-10 mg/mL). The test extracts were microbicidal in nature and showed a prolonged post antibiotic effect ranging from 2 to 8 h. They were found to be biosafe as per Ames and MTT assay.

We successfully synthesized epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)-loaded nanoparticles (Enano), which were composed of EGCG, PC, (+) alpha-tocopherol , and surfactant. We also incorporated KOdiA-PC on the surface of Enano to make ligand-coated Enano (L-Enano) to target intimal macrophages. The objectives of this study were to determine the anti-atherogenic effects of Enano and L-Enano in LDL receptor null (LDLr-/-) mice. Our in vitro data demonstrated that L-Enano had a higher binding affinity to mouse peritoneal macrophages than Enano. This high binding affinity was diminished by CD36 antibodies or knockdown of the CD36 receptor in mouse peritoneal macrophages, confirming the specific binding of L-Enano to the macrophage CD36 receptor. LDLr-/- mice were randomly divided to six groups and received weekly tail vein injection with PBS, EGCG, void nanoparticles (Vnano), Enano, ligand-coated Vnano (L-Vnano), or L-Enano once per week for 22 weeks. The dose of EGCG was 25 mg per kg . L-Enano at 20 μg/mL significantly decreased production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-6 from mouse macrophages, while having no effect on their plasma levels compared to the PBS control. There were no significant differences in blood lipid profiles among six treatment groups. Mice treated with L-Enano also had significantly smaller lesion surface areas on aortic arches compared to the PBS control. Liver EGCG content was decreased by treatments in the order of EGCG>Enano>L-Enano. Native EGCG had inhibitory effects on liver and  fat accumulation. This molecular target approach signals an important step towards inhibiting atherosclerosis development via targeted delivery of bioactive compounds to intimal macrophages.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

W1.</a></h2><p>Cellulose is the most abundant and widely used biopolymer on earth and can be produced by both plants and micro-organisms. Among bacterial cellulose (BC)-producing bacteria, the strains in genus  have attracted wide attention due to their particular ability in furthering BC production. Our previous study reported a new strain of genus  from a vinegar factory. To evaluate its capacity for BC production from different carbon sources, the present study subjected the strain to media spiked with 2% , ethanol, fructose, glucose, lactose, mannitol or sucrose. Then the BC productivity, BC characteristics and biochemical transformation pathways of various carbon sources were fully investigated. After 14 days of incubation, strain W1 produced 0.040⁻1.529 g L BC, the highest yield being observed in fructose. Unlike BC yields, the morphology and microfibrils of BCs from different carbon sources were similar, with an average diameter of 35⁻50 nm. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that all membranes produced from various carbon sources had 1⁻3 typical diffraction peaks, and the highest crystallinity (i.e., 90%) was found for BC produced from mannitol. Similarly, several typical spectra bands obtained by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were similar for the BCs produced from different carbon sources, as was the  fraction. The genome annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed that the biochemical transformation pathways associated with the utilization of and BC production from fructose, glucose, glycerol, and mannitol were found in strain W1, but this was not the case for other carbon sources. Our data provides suggestions for further investigations of strain W1 to produce BC by using low molecular  sugars and gives clues to understand how this strain produces BC based on metabolic pathway analysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31100430>Micro-scale solubility assessments and prediction models for active pharmaceutical ingredients in polymeric matrices.</a></h2><p>The number of models for assessing the solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in polymeric matrices on the one hand and the extent of available associated data on the other hand has been rising steadily in the past few years. However, according to our knowledge an overview on the methods used for prediction and the respective experimental data is missing. Therefore, we compiled experimental data, the techniques used for their determination and the models used for estimating the solubility. Our focus was on polymers commonly used in spray drying and hot-melt extrusion to form amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs), namely polyvinylpyrrolidone grades (PVP), polyvinyl  (PVAc), vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl  copolymer (copovidone, COP), polyvinyl caprolactam-polyvinyl -polyethylene glycol graft polymer (Soluplus®, SOL), different types of methacrylate copolymers (PMMA), polyethylene glycol grades (PEG) and hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose grades (HPMC). The literature data were further supplemented by our own results. The final data set included 37 APIs and two sugar derivatives. The majority of the prediction models was constituted by the melting point depression method, dissolution endpoint measurements, indirect solubility determination by T and the use of low molecular  analogues. We observed that the API solubility depended more on the working group which conducted the experiments than on the measuring technique used. Furthermore, this compilation should assist researchers in choosing a prediction method suited for their investigations. Furthermore, a statistical assessment using recursive feature elimination was performed to identify descriptors of molecules, which are connected to the API solubility in polymeric matrices. It is capable of predicting the criterium 20% API soluble at 100 °C (Yes/No) for an unknown compound with a balanced accuracy of 71%. The identified 8 descriptors to be connected to API solubility in polymeric matrices were the number of hydrogen bonding donors, three descriptors related to the hydrophobicity of the molecule, glass transition temperature, fractional negative polar van der Waals surface area, out-of-plane potential energy and the fraction of rotatable bonds. Finally, in addition to our own model, the data set should help researchers in training their own solubility prediction models.Copyright © 2019.

Heifers in Experiments 1 (n = 524) and 2 (n = 456) were assigned within pen to balanced treatments based on  and reproductive tract score (RTS; Scale 1-5). In Experiment 1, MGA (0.5 mg∙animal∙d) was fed for 14 d, and prostaglandin F (PG; 250 μg im cloprostenol sodium) was administered 19 d after MGA withdrawal. In Experiment 2, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH; 100 μg gonadorelin ) was administered coincident with CIDR (1.38 g progesterone [P]) insertion. Inserts were removed after 7 d, and PG (250 μg im cloprostenol sodium) was administered at CIDR removal. In both experiments, estrus detection aids (Estrotect) were applied at the time of PG administration. Estrous status was recorded at FTAI or STAI. Estrus was defined as removal of ≥ 50% of the grey coating from the Estrotect patch. Heifers assigned to FTAI treatments received GnRH and were artificially inseminated at the standard time for FTAI for each protocol: 72 or 54 h after PG administration for the MGA-PG or 7-d CO-Synch + CIDR protocol, respectively. In the STAI treatments, only heifers that expressed estrus prior to the standard time of FTAI were artificially inseminated at that time. For heifers failing to express estrus, AI was postponed 24 h. Only heifers that failed to exhibit estrus by the delayed time received GnRH concurrent with AI. In both experiments, estrous response prior to the standard time of FTAI did not differ between treatments. Total estrous response was increased (P < 0.01) among heifers assigned to STAI in Experiment 1 (88%, STAI; 72%, FTAI) and 2 (74%, STAI; 47%, FTAI). In Experiment 1, pregnancy rates resulting from AI were greater (P < 0.04) for heifers assigned to STAI compared with FTAI (55% vs 46%, respectively). In Experiment 2, pregnancy rates resulting from AI were similar between treatments (48% and 46%, respectively; P = 0.6). In summary, when compared with FTAI, STAI resulted in greater estrous response following both the MGA-PG and 7-d CO-Synch + CIDR protocols. The increased estrous response through use of STAI was associated with a corresponding increase in pregnancy rates to AI following the MGA-PG protocol; however, a similar improvement in pregnancy rates was not observed following the 7-d CO-Synch + CIDR protocol.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This paper proposes a microfluidic device for the study of protozoa behaviors change due to their chemotactic response in the presence of bacterial cells. A three-channel microfluidic device was designed using a nitrocellulose membrane into which channels were cut using a laser cutter. The membrane was sandwiched between two glass slides; a Euglena suspension was then allowed to flow through the central channel. The two side channels were filled with either, 0.1% peptone as a negative control, or a Listeria suspension respectively. The membrane design prevented direct interaction but allowed Euglena cells to detect Listeria cells as secretions diffused through the nitrocellulose membrane. A significant number of Euglena cells migrated toward the chambers near the bacterial cells, indicating a positive chemotactic response of Euglena toward chemical cues released from Listeria cells. Filtrates collected from Listeria suspension with a series of molecular  cutoffs (3k, 10k and 100k) were examined in Euglena chemotaxis tests. Euglena cells were attracted to all filtrates collected from the membrane filtration with different molecular  cutoffs, suggesting small molecules from Listeria might be the chemical cues to attract protozoa. Headspace volatile organic compounds (VOC) released from Listeria were collected, spiked to 0.1% peptone and tested as the chemotactic effectors. It was discovered that the Euglena cells responded quickly to Listeria VOCs including decanal, 3,5- dimethylbenzaldehyde, ethyl , indicating bacterial VOCs were used by Euglena to track the location of bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126554>The efficacy of Tung's acupuncture for sex hormones in polycystic ovary syndrome: A randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common and heterogeneous endocrine disorder in reproductive-age women. Tung's acupuncture, a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment, is widely used for PCOS in East Asia, but evidence on its efficacy is rare. The aim of this RCT study was to examine whether the Tung's acupuncture could be a complementary treatment method for PCOS.A total of 60 PCOS patients were randomly assigned to a Tung's acupuncture group (n = 30) or a cyproterone /ethinylestradiol (CPA/EE) group (n = 30). Each participant received treatments for 12 weeks to assess the short-term treatment efficacy and then followed up for another 12 weeks to assess the long-term treatment efficacy. The primary outcome examined was change in the ratio of luteinizing hormone (LH) to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); the secondary outcomes examined were changes in  mass index (BMI), LH, FSH, total testosterone (TT), ovarian volume, polycystic ovary number and menstrual frequency.Both groups showed significant reductions in the LH/FSH ratio, LH and TT after 12-week treatment (p < 0.001) and 12-week follow-up (p < 0.05). No significant differences existed between the two groups (p > 0.05). Both groups showed significant improvement in BMI, menstrual frequency and polycystic ovary number after 12-week treatment (p < 0.05).Compared with CPA/EE, Tung's acupuncture showed no better improvement on LH/FSH ratio for PCOS although it could reduce the ratio. Tung's acupuncture might have some effect on long-term  control and menstruation frequency. Further studies addressing this study's limitations are recommended.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Along with 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL), it is known for its prebiotic, immunomodulator, neonatal brain development, and antimicrobial function. Whereas the biological production of 2'-FL has been widely studied and made significant progress over the years, the biological production of 3-FL has been hampered by the low activity and insoluble expression of α-1,3-fucosyltransferase (FutA), relatively low abundance in human milk oligosaccharides compared with 2'-FL, and lower digestibility of 3-FL than 2'-FL by bifidobacteria. In this study, we report the gram-scale production of 3-FL using E. coli BL21(DE3). We previously generated the FutA quadruple mutant (mFutA) with four site mutations at S46F, A128N, H129E, Y132I, and its specific activity was increased by nearly 15 times compared with that of wild-type FutA owing to the increase in k and the decrease in K . We overexpressed mFutA in its maximum expression level, which was achieved by the optimization of yeast extract concentration in culture media. We also overexpressed L-fucokinase/GDP- L-fucose pyrophosphorylase to increase the supply of GDP-fucose in the cytoplasm. To increase the mass of recombinant whole-cell catalysts, the host E. coli BW25113 was switched to E. coli BL21(DE3) because of the lower  accumulation of E. coli BL21(DE3) than that of E. coli BW25113. Finally, the lactose operon was modified by partially deleting the sequence of LacZ (lacZΔm15) for better utilization of D-lactose. Production using the lacZΔm15 mutant yielded 3-FL concentration of 4.6 g/L with the productivity of 0.076 g·L ·hr and the specific 3-FL yield of 0.5 g/g dry cell .© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30895975>Associative properties of poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(vinyl ) comb-like graft copolymers in water.</a></h2><p>The self-assembly of amphiphilic graft copolymers is generally reported for polymer melts or polymers deposited onto surfaces, while a small number of cases deal with binary mixtures with water. We report on the associative properties of poly(ethylene glycol)-graft-poly(vinyl ) (PEG-g-PVAc) comb-like copolymers in water, demonstrating the existence of a percolative behaviour when increasing the PEG-g-PVAc content. Rheology, light- and small-angle X-ray scattering experiments, together with dissipative particle dynamics simulations, reveal a progressive transition from spherical polymer single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) towards hierarchically complex structures as the  fraction of the polymer in water increases.

To increase its tensile strength and flexibility, CS (20-60 wt%) was blended with PVA at various  ratios (80-40 wt%). Triethylamine (TEA) was added as a homogeneous catalyst to increase intermolecular interaction and induce miscibility between CS and PVA. The crystallinity and hydrophobicity of blend films containing 20 wt% CS were promoted by the elimination of residual  groups in PVA. The number of hydrogen bonds in these blend films increased, which led to stronger interaction and more compact molecular packing between CS and PVA chains. The poor water resistance that limits the shelf-life and applications of CS blends was improved. The addition of TEA to blend films containing 20 wt% CS increased water resistance by 80% and tensile strength by as much as 440%. The development of greater structural integrity yielded ecologically sustainable, low-cost, biodegradable films with excellent physical and mechanical properties.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Heifers were assigned to either an 18 d (Day 0-18) or 14 d (Day 4 to Day 18) CIDR treatment (1.38 g progesterone controlled internal drug release insert; Zoetis, Madison, NJ), with prostaglandin F (PG; 250 μg im cloprostenol sodium) administered 16 d after CIDR removal (Day 34). Heifers at two locations (location one, n = 193; location two, n = 649) were assigned to treatment based on reproductive tract score (RTS; Scale 1-5) and . Heifers that were assigned RTS 1 were not retained for the trial (n = 6). Estrus detection aids (Estrotect) were applied at PG. Split-time artificial insemination (STAI) was utilized and AI performed based on expression of estrus at 66 h. Expression of estrus was defined as removal of ≥50% of the grey coating from the Estrotect patch. Heifers that expressed estrus at 66 h were inseminated then and heifers that had not expressed estrus were inseminated at 90 h. Only heifers that failed to express estrus by 90 h received gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH; 100 μg im gonadorelin ) at the time of AI. At location one, blood samples were collected at PG and AI (66 h or 90 h) from all heifers to determine E concentration by radioimmunoassay, and transrectal ovarian ultrasound was performed to detail ovarian structures on a subset of heifers (n = 73) at both time points. The proportion of heifers expressing estrus did not differ between treatments, either by 66 h (60%) or in total by 90 h (84%) after PG. Pregnancy rate to STAI did not differ between treatments (P = 0.3; 52%, 14-d CIDR-PG; 50%, 18-d CIDR-PG), or at the end of the 60 d breeding season (P = 0.2; 86%, 14-d CIDR-PG; 82%, 18-d CIDR-PG). No differences were detected in mean diameter of the dominant follicle at PG (P = 0.6; 10.9 ± 0.4 mm, 14-d CIDR-PG; 11.0 ± 0.4 mm, 18-d CIDR-PG) or at STAI (P = 0.3; 12.6 ± 0.4 mm, 14-d CIDR-PG; 13.2 ± 0.4 mm, 18-d CIDR-PG), nor were any differences observed between treatments in concentrations of E at PG (P = 0.8; 1.1 ± 0.19 pg/ml, 14-d CIDR-PG; 1.1 ± 0.19 pg/ml, 18-d CIDR-PG) or STAI (P = 0.6; 3.8 ± 0.19 pg/ml, 14-d CIDR-PG; 3.6 ± 0.19 pg/ml, 18-d CIDR-PG).

We describe six girls with precocious and/or early-onset, rapidly progressive puberty before and following renal transplantation. Methods Of 112 children under the age of 18 years (67 boys, 45 girls) who received renal transplants between 2010 and 2018, six girls presented with precocious or rapidly progressive early puberty at ages 6-7/12, 7-2/12, 7-4/12, 8, 8-8/12 and 8-11/12 years. Clinical evaluation included measurements of height, ,  mass index (BMI), Tanner staging and bone age assessment. Gonadotropin responses to intravenous gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) or intramuscular triptorelin  were determined. Results Tanner breast stage 3 was noted at 2-6 years following renal transplantation in five girls, four with preserved kidney function. One girl began puberty before renal transplantation. Peak luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were 6.5, 20.2, 7.83, 19.1, 9 and 2.2 mIU/mL and 13, 8.3, 8.01, 7.5, 8.1 and 7.7 mIU/mL, respectively. Treatment with an intramuscular slow-release formulation of triptorelin  every 4 weeks slowed progression of breast development. Conclusions Although delayed puberty is more common in children with renal disease, precocious puberty can also be seen. Evaluation of growth and puberty by a pediatric endocrinologist should be part of the routine care for all children following kidney transplantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133986>Potential Anti-obesogenic Effects of  Observed in Epididymal White Adipose Tissue of Obese Rats.</a></h2><p>Exacerbated expansion of adipose tissue seen in diet-induced obesity leads to endocrine dysfunction and disturbance in adipokine secretion, with such abnormal profile positively associated with type 2 diabetes and other mild chronic inflammatory conditions.  extract (GbE), a mixture of polyphenols with antioxidant properties, has been recently investigated in a variety of experimental models of endocrine dysfunction, with several potentially beneficial effects identified, including improvement in insulin sensitivity in obese rats, and reduction of  gain in ovariectomy-induced obesity and diet-induced obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate in high fat diet-induced obese male rats the effects of GbE supplementation for 2 weeks on adipocyte volume and adipose tissue lipid accumulation. GbE supplementation was effective in reducing energy intake in obese rats compared to the saline-treated placebo group. Epididymal adipocyte volume was reduced in GbE-supplemented rats, as were epididymal [1-C]- incorporation into fatty acids, perilipin () and fatty acid synthase () mRNA, and FAS protein levels. Adipocyte hypertrophy in obesity is associated with insulin resistance, and in the present study we observed a reduction in the adipocyte volume of GbE-supplemented obese rats to dimensions equivalent to adipocytes from non-obese rats. GbE supplementation significantly reduced  accumulation and tended to reduce [H]-oleate incorporation, into epididymal adipose tissue, suggesting a potentially anti-obesogenic effect in longer term therapies. Further studies that investigate the effects of GbE supplementation in other experimental models are required to fully elucidate its suggested beneficial effects on mild chronic inflammatory conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31087984>[Assessing Performance of Pollutant Removal from Municipal Wastewater by Physical and Chemical Methods Based on Membranes].</a></h2><p>The removal characteristics of various pollution factors in municipal wastewater by membrane-based physical and chemical treatment, especially the enrichment characteristics of dissolved organic matter, were investigated by high performance liquid chromatography and three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy. The results showed that the municipal wastewater had a low COD/TN ratio after the treatment. The micro-flocculation filtration mainly enriched the non-dissolvable organic matter in the raw water and aromatic protein substances with relative molecular mass greater than 30 000. The enrichment degree was up to 60.93%, especially for tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like substances. The dissolved organic matter (DOM) with a molecular  greater than 30 000 was enriched fully by 0.45 μm and 0.22 μm  membranes, but the microfiltration membrane was not selective for the enrichment of organic matter.

Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles were fabricated by the single emulsion oil-in-water method and the particle size was characterized using laser diffraction and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Sequential Taguchi L12 and L18 orthogonal array (OA) designs were employed to study the influence of ten and eight parameters, respectively, on microparticle size (response). The first optimization step using the L12 design showed that all parameters significantly influenced the particle size of the prepared PLGA microparticles with exception of the concentration of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in the hardening bath. The smallest mean particle size obtained from the L12 design was 54.39 μm. A subsequent L18 design showed that the molecular  of PLGA does not significantly affect the particle size. An experimental run comprising of defined parameters including molecular  of PLGA (89 kDa), concentration of PLGA (20% w/v), concentration of PVA in the emulsion (0.8% w/v), solvent type (ethyl ), organic/aqeuous phase ratio (1:1 v/v), vortexing speed (9), vortexing duration (60 seconds), concentration of PVA in hardening bath (0.8% w/v), stirring speed of hardening bath (1200 rpm) and solvent evaporation duration (24 hours) resulted in the lowest mean particle size of 23.51 μm which was predicted and confirmed by the L18 array. A comparable size was demonstrated during the fabrication of BSA-incorporated microparticles. Taguchi OA design proved to be a valuable tool in determining the combination of process parameters that can provide the optimal condition for microparticle formulation. Taguchi OA design can be used to correctly predict the size of microparticles fabricated by the single emulsion process and can therefore, ultimately, save time and costs during the manufacturing process of drug delivery formulations by minimising experimental runs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480207>Microbial Mechanistic Insights into the Role of Sweet Potato Vine on Improving Health in Chinese Meishan Gilt Model.</a></h2><p>This study explored the impact of fresh sweet potato vine on the growth as well as the metabolites and colon microbial composition in Chinese Meishan gilt. Twenty Meishan gilts ( 30 ± 0.18 kg, n = 10 per treatment) were randomly assigned to a control (CON) or sweet potato vine (SPV) supplementation diet treatment. Gilts were housed in individual stalls. In the SPV treatment, 2 kg fresh sweet potato vine was used instead of 0.18 kg basal diet which provided the same amount of digestive energy and crude protein with the exception of crude fiber (CON, 51.00 g/d vs. SPV, 73.94 g/d) in terms of dry matter intake. Gilts were slaughtered and samples were collected on day 19 after the third estrus cycle. The SPV treatment tended to increase slaughter  of gilts ( = 0.07); it also increased ( < 0.05) gastrointestinal tract  and intestinal muscle layer thickness. SPV treatment also decreased ( < 0.05) carcass yield and subcutaneous adipose tissue. The concentration of zonulin and endotoxin in plasma was decreased ( < 0.05) as the gilt consumed the SPV diet. Colonic fecal concentrations of endotoxin, lipocalin-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were decreased ( < 0.05), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) was increased ( < 0.05) in the SPV treatment. Butyric acid and  concentration in colonic content as well as  concentration in caecal content were increased ( < 0.05) in the SPV treatment. Furthermore, the expression of carnitine palmityl transferase () and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α () in gilt liver in SPV treatment was increased ( < 0.05) in comparison with CON treatment. Meanwhile, the composition of the colon microbes was also altered by SPV; representative changes included an increase in , , , and  These results indicate that gilt fed with sweet potato vine had decreased gut permeability, endotoxin and pro-inflammatory cytokines concentrations; colonic fecal microbiota was also changed, which may be further beneficial to the intestinal health of Chinese Meishan gilt.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220598>Xiexin Tang ameliorates dyslipidemia in high-fat diet-induced obese rats via elevating gut microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids production and adjusting energy metabolism.</a></h2><p>Traditional herbal medicine has been taken as a new and effective approach to treat many chronic diseases. Xiexin Tang (XXT), a compound recipe composed of Dahuang (Rheum palmatum L.), Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) and Huanglian (Coptis chinensis Franch.), has been reported to have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, but its mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study found that Xiexin Tang markedly ameliorated the composition of the gut microbiota, especially for some short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing bacteria, and then notably increased SCFAs production. However, the mechanism of XXT on the fermentation of gut bacteria and further improvement of obesity is not yet clear.This study aimed to unravel the molecular mechanism of XXT on the amelioration of obesity.Here, high-fat diet-induced obese rat model was established to investigate the intervention efficacy following oral administration of XXT. Additionally, the expressions of key enzymes of gut microbe-derived SCFAs biosynthesis and key targets in the signaling pathway of energy metabolism were investigated by ELISA and qPCR analysis.Results showed that XXT could notably correct lipid metabolism disorders, alleviate systematic inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation. Additionally, XXT could increase gut microbiota-derived SCFAs-producing capacity by enhancing mRNA levels and activities of SCFA-synthetic key enzymes such as  kinase (ACK), methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MMD), butyryl-CoA:  CoA transferase (BUT) and butyrate kinase (BUK), which markedly decreased the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents, elevated adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and further lowered the energy charge (EC) in obese rats via activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)/uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) signaling pathway. What's more, XXT could notably ameliorate dyslipidemia via increasing the gene expression of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and blocking mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.Taken together, our data provided a novel insight into the role of XXT in losing  from energy metabolism regulation, which unraveled the molecular mechanism of XXT on the alleviation of dyslipidemia and fat heterotopic accumulation. The study provided useful information for XXT in clinical application to treat obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, a comprehensive set of metabolic markers, predominantly lipids, was compared between depressed and nondepressed persons.Nine Dutch cohorts were included, comprising 10,145 control subjects and 5283 persons with depression, established with diagnostic interviews or questionnaires. A proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics platform provided 230 metabolite : 51 lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular- metabolites; 98 lipid composition and particle concentration  of lipoprotein subclasses; and 81 lipid and fatty acids ratios. For each metabolite measure, logistic regression analyses adjusted for gender, age, smoking, fasting status, and lipid-modifying medication were performed within cohort, followed by random-effects meta-analyses.Of the 51 lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular- metabolites, 21 were significantly related to depression (false discovery rate q < .05). Higher levels of apolipoprotein B, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, diglycerides, total and monounsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid chain length, glycoprotein acetyls, tyrosine, and isoleucine and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, , and apolipoprotein A1 were associated with increased odds of depression. Analyses of lipid composition indicators confirmed a shift toward less high-density lipoprotein and more very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride particles in depression. Associations appeared generally consistent across gender, age, and  mass index strata and across cohorts with depressive diagnoses versus symptoms.This large-scale meta-analysis indicates a clear distinctive profile of circulating lipid metabolites associated with depression, potentially opening new prevention or treatment avenues for depression and its associated cardiometabolic comorbidity.Copyright © 2019 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

The aim was to investigate the impact of lignin structural diversity on film performance. It was confirmed that lignin's distribution in the films was dependent on the polarity of solvents used for fractionation (acetone > methanol > ethanol > ethyl ) and influenced the optical properties of the films. The ⁻OH group content and molecular  of lignin were positively related to film density. In general, the addition of lignin fractions led to decrease in thermal stability and increase in Young's modulus of the composite films. The modulus of the films was found to decrease as the molecular  of lignin increased, and a higher amount of carboxyl and phenolic ⁻OH groups in the lignin fraction resulted in films with higher stiffness. The thermal analysis showed higher char content formation for lignin-containing films in a nitrogen atmosphere with increased molecular . In an oxygen atmosphere, the phenol content, saturated side chains and short chain structures of lignin had impacts on the maximum decomposition temperature of the films, confirming the relationship between the chemical structure of lignin and thermo-oxidative stability of the corresponding film.

Neuropsychological tests [Trail making test A (TMT-A) and Trail making test B (TMT-B)] scores measured cognitive information about processing speed, mental flexibility and executive function.Trail-making test score was significantly altered in obese compared with non-obese subjects. Fecal glutamate and glutamate/glutamine ratio tended to be lower among obese subjects while fecal glutamate/ ratio was negatively associated with BMI and TMT-A scores. Plasma glutamate/ ratio was negatively associated with TMT-B. The relative abundance (RA) of some bacterial families influenced glutamate levels, given the positive association of fecal glutamate/glutamine ratio with Corynebacteriaceae, Coriobacteriaceae and Burkholderiaceae RA. In contrast, Streptococaceae RA, that was significantly higher in obese subjects, negatively correlated with fecal glutamate/glutamine ratio. To close the circle, Coriobacteriaceae/Streptococaceae ratio and Corynebacteriaceae/Streptococaceae ratio were associated both with TMT-A scores and fecal glutamate/glutamine ratio.Gut microbiota composition is associated with processing speed and mental flexibility in part through changes in fecal and plasma glutamate metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914102>[Effect of sodium  Ringer injection on perioperative fluid therapy in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease].</a></h2><p>To evaluate the efficacy of volume therapy with sodium  Ringer solution during the perioperative period in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD).The children who underwent elective surgery for cyanotic CHD admitted to Shanghai Children's Medical Center Affiliated to the Medical School of Shanghai Jiaotong University from September to December 2018 were divided into three groups according to random number table with the informed consent of their legal representatives. All of the children received volume therapy with infusion of sodium  Ringer solution intravenously upon anesthesia induction. The volume of infusion was calculated according to the "4-2-1" formula (group A, the rehydration volume was 4 mL×kg×h for the first 10 kg , 2 mL×kg×h for the second 10 kg, and 1 mL×kg×h for the third 10 kg and above), and the volume was increased by 50% or 100% in groups B and C, respectively. The intravenous infusion lasted for 30 minutes in all the three groups. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed before and 30 minutes after infusion to observe the acid-base status and electrolyte level. Pulse oxygen saturation (SpO), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) before and 10, 20, 30 minutes after infusion, central venous pressure (CVP) at 30 minutes after infusion were recorded, as well as adverse events occurred after infusion.Twenty-six children with cyanotic CHD, 17 male and 9 female, aged from 1 to 36 months,  3.6 to 16.0 kg, and America Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) level of III or IV, were enrolled in the study. The pH value in group B at 30 minutes after infusion was significantly higher than that before infusion (7.35±0.05 vs. 7.32±0.06, P < 0.05), while no significant changes were found before and after infusion in the other two groups. The hematocrits (Hct) after infusion in three groups were significantly lower than those before infusion (0.433±0.141 vs. 0.473±0.146 in group A, 0.324±0.054 vs. 0.372±0.063 in group B, 0.363±0.097 vs. 0.418±0.111 in group C, all P < 0.01), indicating that all the children in the three groups achieved effective hemodilution. However, there was no significant difference in blood gas analysis before and after infusion among the three groups. The level of blood lactic acid (Lac) in all CHD children was decreased from (1.33±0.63) mmol/L to (0.98±0.36) mmol/L after infusion of sodium  Ringer solution, the serum Ca concentration was decreased from (1.22±0.06) mmol/L to (1.19±0.06) mmol/L, and the serum Cl concentration was increased from (108.74±2.70) mmol/L to (109.77±2.54) mmol/L with the statistically significant differences (all P < 0.01). However, no significant difference was found in Lac or electrolyte levels before and after infusion among the three groups. There was no significant difference in vital signs before and after infusion among the three groups, but the period of infusion had an effect on SpO (F = 5.998, P < 0.01), HR (F = 34.279, P < 0.01) and SBP (F = 4.345, P < 0.05). HR in groups A and C were significantly lower than those before infusion, and SBP in group A was decreased gradually with the prolongation of infusion time. The CVP value at 30 minutes after infusion in group B was higher than that in group A. No adverse reactions such as rash or anaphylactic shock occurred after infusion of sodium  Ringer solution in all children.The perioperative volume therapy with sodium  Ringer solution in children with cyanotic CHD can effectively prevent the increase in Lac level and does not aggravate metabolic acidosis. The volume of infusion was well tolerated by all the children without disturbing the hemodynamic parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132690>Dienogest or Norethindrone  for the treatment of ovarian endometriomas: Can we avoid surgery?</a></h2><p>To compare the effects of Dienogest (D) and Norethindrone  (N) in symptomatic women with ovarian endometriomas, analyzing the efficacy in reducing endometrioma size and symptom relief and drug tolerability.Retrospective study including 135 symptomatic women with ultrasonographic diagnosis of ovarian endometrioma. Women were divided into two groups: 1) women who received D 2 mg/day (group D); 2) women who received N 2.5 mg/day (group N). Women were evaluated at therapy prescription and after 6 and 12 months of treatment: transvaginal ultrasound was performed to assess the mean diameter of endometriomas, a Visual Analogue Scale was used to rank endometriosis related symptoms (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain). The main outcome measure was the comparison between the 2 groups in terms of variations in endometrioma size and endometriosis related symptoms during the follow-up. Drug tolerability was also analyzed in terms of side effects.A reduction in ovarian endometrioma size was observed during treatment in both groups, with no significant differences between groups D and N. Endometriosis related symptoms decreased in both groups, but the decrease was significantly higher in group D than in group N for all symptoms, both at 6 and 12 months of treatment. Regarding drug tolerability, uterine bleeding/spotting and  gain were reported more frequently by women in the group N than women in the group D, both at 6 and 12 months of treatment.Progestin therapy with D or N appears to be effective in reducing the size of endometriomas and related symptoms, with a greater effect on symptoms relief and higher tolerability in women treated with D.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, hardly any research has been carried out about it. The present study aimed to evaluate the toxicity in vivo and in vitro. Toxicity was observed by the evaluation of mice  loss and histopathological changes in the liver. Then, the comparison research between ethyl  extract (EAE) and n-butanol extract (BUE) suggested that liver toxicity was mainly induced by BUE. The mechanical study suggested that BUE-induced liver toxicity was closely associated with necrosis detected by MTT and propidium iodide (PI) staining, via releasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reducing the fluidity, and increasing the permeability of the cell membrane. Western blot analysis confirmed that the necrosis occurred molecularly by the up-regulation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) and receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3), as well as the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa-gene binding (NF-κB) signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro.

Gelatin zymography is considered one of the major qualitative/semiquantitative assays for simultaneously determining zymogenic, active, and complexed forms of gelatinases. Critical steps are represented by variations in sample collection methods, molecular  standard calibrators, and different zymography assay protocols. A normalization of these aspects is required for reducing discrepancies in technical procedures and interpreting results among different laboratories. In this study, we describe a novel protocol for gelatin zymography with increased pore size, which improves the separation of gelatinases with different molecular . A new method for obtaining gelatinase calibrator for gelatin zymography, by extracting MMP-2 and MMP-9 from peripheral blood, is also reported. Our method provides a gelatinase calibrator with enhanced stability both at room temperature and during multiple freeze-thaw cycles. This calibrator preparation is also suitable for in vitro post-translational modifications. For the first time, the improved zymography protocol allowed us to reveal in human peripheral blood samples new gelatinolytic bands resolved at very high molecular , likely complexes of MMP-9, undetectable with classical zymography protocols.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31372346>Renoprotective effects of stevia ( Bertoni), amlodipine, valsartan, and losartan in gentamycin-induced nephrotoxicity in the rat model: Biochemical, hematological and histological approaches.</a></h2><p>The current study investigated the renoprotective effects of stevia, angiotensin-II type 1 receptor (AT) blocker and calcium (Ca) channel blocker in gentamycin-induced nephrotoxicity in rat models. Six groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats of eight weeks old were taken for the experiment: sham control, nephrotoxicity, treatment with amlodipine (4 mg/kg/day); stevia (200 mg/kg/day); losartan (15 mg/kg/day) and valsartan (5 mg/kg/day), accordingly.

Treatment with stevia and valsartan significantly decreased serum creatinine levels. A reduction of liver enzymes, and total serum bilirubin levels were observed in all the treatment groups. Treatment with valsartan and amlodipine, remarkably and stevia, mildly reduced the renal tissue damage, inflammation, and tubular necrosis. However, the present study demonstrated that losartan treatment aggravated kidney damage by increasing protein cast, calcification, tubular necrosis, and injury. This comparison indicated that both stevia and valsartan have beneficial renoprotective effect and valsartan offers a better treatment option in renal damage over losartan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140364>Optimized production and quantification of the tryptophan-deficient sweet-tasting protein brazzein in .</a></h2><p>The sweet-tasting protein brazzein is a candidate sugar substitute owing to its sweet, sugar-like taste and good stability.

Using solvents with dissimilar polarities affected the phenolic yields extracted from  and their related antioxidant activities varied significantly among the four investigated plant organs. The leaf extract of acetone 70% contained the highest amount of phenolic compounds (46.56 mg/g dry ); while the bud-water boiled extract maintained the maximum value of tannins (45.68 mg/g dry ). Correlation coefficients indicated that phenolic compounds were mostly accountable for the phosphomolybednum antioxidant potentials (0.520), followed by tannins (0.460). Also, both the reducing power activities and hydrogen peroxide scavenging of  extracts positively correlated with tannins, but at different significance degrees.

We found that GA can complex, condense, and transfect plasmid DNA. Mixing the positively charged GA and the negatively charged genetic material in correct proportions produced small, stable, and highly positively charged nanoparticles. This simple GA-pDNA formulation produced high levels of transfection efficiency with low toxicity in HeLa and A549 cells (lung and cervical cancer cells). Additionally, we studied and compared the nanoparticle properties, gene expression, and cytotoxicity of K-pDNA (high-molecular- polylysine) and K-pDNA (low-molecular- polylysine) nanoparticles to those of GA-pDNA nanoparticles. We also studied the effect of calcium, which was previously reported to reduce the size and enhance gene expression resulting from similar polyelectrolyte complexes. Adding calcium did not reduce particle size, nor improve the transfection efficiency of GA-pDNA nanoparticles as it did for polylysine-pDNA nanoparticles.

During the 21-d suckling period, BW and diarrhoea occurrences of piglets were recorded daily, while faeces were sampled weekly from sows and piglets. The levels of pH, ammonia, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lactate in the faeces of piglets were determined. In particular, bacteria profiles in faeces of sows and their suckling piglets were examined by Illumina sequencing.

To elucidate these effects in more detail and clarify their impact on the analytical measurement techniques and evaluation procedures, NIR transmission spectra and Raman spectra of two organic liquid three-component systems with variable compositions were analyzed by two different multivariate calibration procedures, partial least squares (PLS) and classical least-squares (CLS) regression. Furthermore, the effect of applying different concentration units (volume percent (%V) and  percent (%W) on the performance of the two calibration procedures have been tested. While the mixtures of benzene/cyclohexane/ethylbenzene (system 1) can be regarded as a blended system with comparatively low molecular interactions, hydrogen bonding plays a dominant role in the blends of ethyl /1-heptanol/1,4-dioxane (system 2). Whereas system 1 yielded equally good calibrations by PLS and CLS regression, for system 2 acceptable results were only obtained by PLS regression. Additionally, for both sample systems, Raman spectra generally led to lower calibration performance than NIR spectra.

The resulting EVA fiber with cylindrical structure had a diameter of 261.86 ± 13.07 μm, and its mechanical strength and elongation at break were 64.46 MPa and 114.33%, respectively. The critical impact of the crosslink density and applied constant stress on the two-way shape memory effect were analyzed. Moreover, the single EVA fiber could lift more than 143 times its own  and achieve 9% reversible actuation strain.

A new potent candidate regimen containing pyrazinamide (PZA), ethambutol (EMB), protionamide (PTO) and clofazimine (CFZ) was proposed by Parabolic Response Surface/Feedback System Control (FSC/PRS) system and showed excellent outcomes in vitro and vivo studies. Here, a convenient liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the simultaneously determination of four compounds in beagle dog plasma. The plasma samples, 50 μL for each, were pretreated by methanol on 96-well format plates and a further dilution step was designed to reduce predictable matrix effect and lessen the burden of subsequent analysis. The chromatographic separation was achieved on an Agilent SB-Aq column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, 5 μm) at 30 °C by a gradient elution within 6 min. The mobile phase was a mixture of 0.2% formic acid-5 mM ammonium  aqueous solution (phase A) and 0.2% formic acid methanol (phase B) with a total flow rate of 1 mL/min. The 30% of post-column eluant was injected into mass spectrometer, equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) source under positive mode and multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM). This quantification method was proved to be satisfied in selectivity, accuracy, precision, linearity (r > 0.998), recovery, matrix effect and stability.

Twenty-four Doper × Small Tail Han ewes (6-7 months of age; 29.07 ± 2.28 kg initial ) were randomly assigned to one of three treatments for a 47 d feeding period. Treatments consisted of the sheep diet supplemented with 0% ABP-control, 10% ABP, or 15% ABP of the diet (dry matter basis). Blood samples were collected on days 0, 15, 30, and 45 of the feeding period. APB supplementation did not affect growth performance and apparent digestibility of organic matter, crude protein, and acid detergent fibre ( > 0.05). However, ether extract digestibility was decreased in the 10% ABP group and increased in the 15% ABP group ( < 0.001), and both 10% ABP and 15% ABP decreased the neutral detergent fibre digestibility (=0.005). Feeding ABP increased rumen pH ( < 0.001) and ammonia N ( < 0.001) and decreased concentrations of  (=0.007) and propionate (=0.001) which resultantly increased the -to-propionate ratio ( < 0.001) in ruminal fluid. There were no interaction effects between treatment and sampling time for plasma metabolites and immunity ( > 0.05). However, inclusion of dietary 10% ABP decreased concentrations of plasma cholesterol (=0.043). Also, plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein decreased on days 30 and 45 (=0.017) of the feeding period. Metabolite concentrations of total protein, albumin, globulin, blood urea N, glucose, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and humoral immune indicators were not affected ( > 0.05) by dietary ABP supplementation. The results suggest that ABP could be reclaimed through dietary inclusion in animal feed since it had beneficial effects on rumen fermentation patterns and lipid metabolism and had no adverse effects on performance and humoral immunity in sheep.Copyright © 2019 Abedin Abdallah et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31258330>Determination of Dipicolinic Acid in "Natto" by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Coupled With Postcolumn Photoirradiation With Zinc .</a></h2><p>A system was developed for determining dipicolinic acid in "natto" using liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection.

In November 2013, European authorities changed the label for a levonorgestrel EC product to warn of a reduction in effectiveness for women with higher BMI, garnering significant media coverage in the United States. Ulipristal  (UPA) EC may be more effective than levonorgestrel for women with BMI levels designated as obese. Among 8,019 women who received UPA from the online pharmacy KwikMed from 2011 to 2015 and self-reported their height,  and reasons for seeking UPA online, we analyzed changes in the proportion of women in different BMI categories before and after the label change. For the 25 month-period after the label change, the proportion of women in the obese category rose by 26.7 percentage points relative to the 35 months before (B = 0.2665,  < .01). Mean BMI (25.5 versus 29.4,  < .001) and average  (148.6 pounds versus 175.5 pounds,  < .001) of users were higher after the label change.

However, there are studies as how altering forage type influences ruminal fermentation parameters and animal growth performance, and interact with microbiota in meat goats. Our objective for current study was to examine whether the comparative abundance of the Bacteroidetes (B) and Firmicutes (F) bacterial phyla in meat goats fed simple and mixed forages influenced average daily gain (ADG) and rumen fermentation parameters. In the present study, a molecular approach, bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) was applied to accomplish diversity analyses of rumen bacterial populations. Thirty-six Kiko-cross growing meat goats ( (BW) = 27.7 ± 2.83 kg) at approximately 7 mo of age were used in this study. Animals were randomly allocated to 3 pasture treatment groups (n = 12) as follows: 1) bermudagrass pasture (BG; Cynodon dactylon), 2) sunn hemp forage (SH; Crotalaria juncea), and 3) BG + SH forage combinations. There were 2 replicates per treatment and animals grazed these pastures for 45 d. Results indicated that treatments had similar initial BW, but final BW and ADG were higher (P < 0.01) for SH and BG + SH combinations than for BG alone. Animal ADG and rumen fermentation ( to propionate; A/P ratios) were highly correlated with the abundance of various bacterial populations within the rumen microbiome. There were linear decreases in percentage of Bacteroidetes (R2 = -0.84; P < 0.05) associated with decreasing ADG. In contrast, increased ADG was linearly associated with higher percentages of Firmicutes (R2 = 0.79; P < 0.05), F/B ratios (R2 = 0.88; P = 0.07), total VFA (R2 = 0.45; P < 0.05), and lower A/P ratio (R2 = -0.72; P < 0.01). This suggests that the substrates (diets) and bacterial community have the role in adapting host biological parameters in meat goats. The abundance examination of both Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes will be useful for exploring the structure of gut microbiota as an estimate of animal performance.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30891568>An in vivo study of the pharmacological activities of a methanolic  fraction of  L.: An ethno-medicinal plant used in Bangladesh.</a></h2><p>The present study covered an assessment of methanolic  fractions of , commonly known as water lettuce, for analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and CNS depressant activities.The methanol  fractions were extracted from  and administered to the experimental animals as 200 and 400 mg/kg doses to determine the effect on acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin-induced licking and biting, for the assessment of analgesic activity. The anti-inflammatory assay was done using the carrageenan-induced hind paw edema method, while assessment of CNS depressant activity was done using the open field and hole cross tests. The effects were compared to standard reference drugs.At both doses (200 and 400 mg/kg ), the methanolic  extract of  showed significant analgesic action (<0.05) against acetic acid-induced writhing. The extract was also found to give significant protection against licking and biting at both doses. The methanolic  extract of  showed a significant (<0.05) anti-inflammatory effect from 0 minutes up to 3 hours in the carrageenan-induced paw edema test. In the CNS depressant assay, the methanolic  extract showed significant (<0.05) depressant activity at both doses from 30 to 120 minutes in both the hole cross and open field tests.Thus we can conclude that  extracts have significant analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and CNS depressant activity, compared to standard compounds, in an animal model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149326>Nephroprotective effect of  on lead induced kidney damage in albino rats.</a></h2><p>Lead is a nephrotoxicant probably implicated in the rising incidence of chronic kidney injury in sub-Sahara Africa.

Hematological, antioxidant and histological parameters obtained from the result serve as scientific evidence in the study. treatment significantly reversed (P < 0.05) the decrease in the levels of gluthatione peroxidase (GSH-PX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), Glutathione-S-trasferase activity (GST) seen in the lead  only treated group. Similarly, the increased malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the lead  only treated group was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in the  treated groups. There were significant (P < 0.05) decreases in serum serum level of sodium (146 ± 2.1 to 133 ± 6.0) and potassium (5.1 ± 0.4 to 4.4 ± 0.3) in lead  alone and treated group respectively.

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of galloyl-hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP)-glucose isolated from pomegranate leaves on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. Male BALB/c mice were treated with different doses of galloyl-HHDP-glucose (5, 50, and 100 mg/Kg) or dexamethasone at 5 mg/Kg () 6 h after intra-tracheal instillation of LPS. Vehicle-treated mice were used as controls. Twenty-four hours after LPS challenge, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung samples were collected for analyses. They were evaluated by monitoring the expression of NF-κB, JNK, and cytokine genes and proteins, as well as cell migration and lung function. All doses of galloyl-HHDP-glucose inhibited LPS-induced JNK and NF-κB activation. Likewise, the galloyl-HHDP-glucose-treated animals presented reduced expression of the TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β genes in the lungs and reduced TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 protein levels when compared with the vehicle-treated LPS-challenged mice. In addition, the ALI mice treated with galloyl-HHDP-glucose also presented reduced lung inflammatory cell accumulation, especially that of neutrophils, in their BALF and lungs. In addition, galloyl-HHDP-glucose treatment markedly ameliorated the LPS-induced pulmonary mechanism complications and attenuated  loss. Overall, we showed for the first time that galloyl-HHDP-glucose protects against ALI, and may be useful for treating ALI and other inflammatory disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30978446>Comparison of several non-specific skin mucus immune defences in three piscine species of aquaculture interest.</a></h2><p>Fish skin mucus is a viscous and semipermeable barrier made mainly of water, glycoproteins and soluble proteins. It represents an important defence against the environment and previous studies have reported the presence of different substances involved in immune defence responses in it. The aim of the present work was to characterize skin mucus protease activity by zymography and esterase activity of the subfamily of carboxylesterases in three species of interest for aquaculture: gilthead sea bream, sea bass and meagre. Mucus antioxidant power was also determined by adapting ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) analysis. As a result of these non-specific immune defence parameters, we compared the antibacterial capacity of skin mucus in these species via in vitro dual bacteria strains-skin mucus co-culture growths. We used Pseudomonas anguilliseptica and Vibrio anguillarum as marine pathogenic bacteria and Escherichia coli as non-pathogenic. For each fish species, in the respective zymograms, we determined a pattern of proteolytic digestion bands. A high-molecular- band (around 200 kDa; H-band) was evident in sea bream and sea bass, and showed chymotrypsin activity. One or two intermediate-molecular- bands (around 75 kDa; I-bands) with non-trypsin and non-chymotrypsin activity, and putatively with metalloprotease activity, were evident in all species. Finally, low-molecular- bands (between 14 and 30 kDa; L-bands) showed distinct patterns for each species and matched trypsin activity. Despite the conservative pattern of digestion bands, the levels of total proteolytic activity (TPA) were 5 and 10 times higher in meagre than in sea bass and sea bream, respectively. In parallel, three carboxylesterase activities were detected in the mucus of the three fish species, using myristate (pNPM-CE activity), butyrate (pNPB-CE activity) and  (pNPA-CE activity) as substrates. Both pNPB-CE and pNPA-CE were the most abundant in fish mucus, and meagre was again the species with the highest levels. In contrast, the antioxidant power of meagre skin mucus was the lowest. We established the capacity of skin mucus to block or limit bacterial growth (lytic activity) using 24 h growth curves. The log-growth phase of V. anguillarum was strongly blocked by sea bream and meagre mucus for a few hours; but not by sea bass mucus. However, if mucus was not renewed, log-growth was at the end of 24 h studied period. For its part, P. anguilliseptica growth curve was delayed by the three mucus types during the entire growth period. Only meagre achieved lytic activity against E. coli growth. All parameters studied here will be of a great interest as non-invasive bioindicators of non-specific immune defences in fish skin mucus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the effects of roughage sources and concentrate types on growth performance, ruminal fermentation, and blood metabolite levels in growing cattle.In this 24-week trial, 24 Hanwoo cattle (224±24.7 kg) were fed similar nitrous and energy levels of total mixed ration formulated using two kinds of roughage (timothy hay and ryegrass straw) and two types of concentrate mixes (high starch [HS] and high fiber [HF]). The treatments were arranged in a 2×2 factorial, consisting of 32% timothy-68% HS, 24% timothy-76% HF, 24% ryegrass-76% HS, and 17% ryegrass-83% HF. Daily feed intakes were measured. Every four weeks, blood were sampled, and  was measured before morning feeding. Every eight weeks, rumen fluid was collected using a stomach tube over five consecutive days.The mean dry matter intake (7.33 kg) and average daily gain (1,033 g) did not differ among treatments. However, significant interactions between roughage source and concentrate type were observed for the rumen and blood parameters (p<0.05). Total volatile fatty acid concentration was highest (p<0.05) in timothy-HF-fed calves. With ryegrass as the roughage source, decreasing the roughage inclusion rate increased the molar proportion of propionate and decreased the -to-propionate ratio; the opposite was observed with timothy as the roughage source. Similarly, the effects of concentrate types on plasma total protein, alanine transaminase, Ca, inorganic P, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and creatinine concentrations differed with roughage source (p<0.05).Decreasing the dietary roughage inclusion rate by replacing forage neutral detergent fiber with that from non-roughage fiber source might be a feasible feeding practice in growing cattle. A combination of low-quality roughage with a high fiber concentrate might be economically beneficial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261003>Analysis of Scotch Whisky by H NMR and chemometrics yields insight into its complex chemistry.</a></h2><p>Scotch Whisky has been analysed as a complex mixture in its raw form using high resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and previously developed water and ethanol suppression techniques. This has allowed for the positive identification of 25 compounds in Scotch Whisky by means of comparison to reference standards, spike-in experiments, and advanced 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Quantification of compounds was hindered by signal overlap, though peak alignment strategies were largely successful. Statistical total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY) yielded information on signals arising from the same compound or compounds of similar origin. Statistical analysis of the spectra was performed using Independent and Principal Components Analysis (ICA, PCA) as well as Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA). Several whisky production parameters were successfully modelled, including blend or malt status, use of peated malt, alcohol strength, generic authentication and maturation wood type, whilst age and geographical origin could not be modelled.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study further demonstrated that DRE exhibits anti-obesity effects in C57BL/6 obese mice. The degree of adipocyte differentiation was determined using Oil red O stain; results indicated a decrease in fat globules, which was dependent on DRE concentration, when pre-adipocytes were treated with differentiation-inducing agents. In addition, this significantly reduced the expression of the adipogenic transcription factor and related genes. C57BL/6 obese mice treated with DRE showed a lower rate of  gain than the high-fat diet (HFD) group mice. Further, the level of serum triglyceride in the DRE treatment group was lower than that in the HFD group. The findings show that DRE are capable of suppressing adipocyte accumulation; therefore, DRE may represent a promising source of functional materials for the anti-obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016743>Investigation of the effects of natural compounds isolated from Arum rupicola var. rupicola on glutathione reductase enzyme purified from bovine liver.</a></h2><p>Glutathione reductase (GR, E.C. 1.8.1.7), a flavoenzyme, is responsible for recycling of oxidized glutathione disulfide. This study was performed in two main sections. In the first GR was purified from bovine liver by affinity column chromatography and the purification rate and specific activity of the enzyme were calculated as 1832-fold and 141 EU/mg protein, respectively. The subunit molecular  of the enzyme was determined as 55 kDa by means of SDS-PAGE. The second section isolated natural components of Arum rupicola Boiss. var. rupicola using column chromatography. The isolation protocol for this plant was performed with a series of different-sized columns with hexane-ethyl . According to the thin-layer chromatography plate, seven substances (R1-R7) were isolated. Our study's aim was to find new activators or inhibitors for GR activity. With this aim, all isolated substances were tested for GR activity. R6 showed competitive inhibition, while R4 had noncompetitive inhibition of GR activity. R1 played a role as an activator of GR activity. The inhibitory activity percentage vs. concentration graph was plotted. Values of IC for R4 and R6 were calculated as 0.193 mg/mL and 3.98 μg/mL, respectively, from the equation of this graph.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425626>Cyclical progestogens for heavy menstrual bleeding.</a></h2><p>Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a menstrual blood loss perceived by women as excessive that affects the health of women of reproductive age, interfering with their physical, emotional, social and material quality of life. Whilst abnormal menstrual bleeding may be associated with underlying pathology, in the present context, HMB is defined as excessive menstrual bleeding in the absence of other systemic or gynaecological disease. The first-line therapy is usually medical, avoiding possibly unnecessary surgery. Of the wide variety of medications used to reduce HMB, oral progestogens were originally the most commonly prescribed agents. This review assesses the effectiveness of two different types and regimens of oral progestogens in reducing ovulatory HMB.This is the update of a Cochrane review last updated in 2007, and originally named "Effectiveness of cyclical progestagen therapy in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding" (1998).To determine the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of oral progestogen therapy taken either during the luteal phase (short cycle) or for a longer course of 21 days per cycle (long cycle), in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive age with HMB.In January 2019 we searched Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility's specialized register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycInfo. We also searched trials registers, other sources of unpublished or grey literature and reference lists of retrieved trials. We also checked citation lists of review articles to identify trials.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatments for HMB that included cyclical oral progestogens were eligible.Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for clarification of methods or additional data when necessary. We only assessed adverse events if they were separately measured in the included trials. We compared cyclical oral progestogen in different regimens and placebo or other treatments. Our primary outcomes were menstrual blood loss and satisfaction with treatment; the secondary outcomes were number of days of bleeding, quality of life, compliance and acceptability of treatment, adverse events and costs.This review identified 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1071 women in total. Most of the women knew which treatment they were receiving, which may have influenced their judgements about menstrual blood loss and satisfaction. Other aspects of trial quality varied among trials.We did not identify any RCTs comparing progestogen treatment with placebo. We assessed comparisons between oral progestogens and other medical therapies separately according to different regimens.Short-cycle progestogen therapy during the luteal phase (medroxyprogesterone  or norethisterone for 7 to 10 days, from day 15 to 19) was inferior to other medical therapy, including tranexamic acid, danazol and the progestogen-releasing intrauterine system (Pg-IUS (off of the market since 2001)), releasing 60 mcg of progesterone daily, with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss (mean difference (MD) 37.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.67 to 56.91; I = 50%; 6 trials, 145 women). The rate of satisfaction and the quality of life with treatment was similar in both groups. The number of bleeding days was greater on the short cycle progestogen group compared to other medical treatments. Adverse events (such as gastrointestinal symptoms and  gain) were more likely with danazol when compared with progestogen treatment. We note that danazol is no longer in general use for treating HMB.Long-cycle progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone  or norethisterone), from day 5 to day 26 of the menstrual cycle, is also inferior to the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), releasing tranexamic acid and ormeloxifene, but may be similar to the combined vaginal ring with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss (MD 16.88, 95% CI 10.93 to 22.84; I = 87%; 4 trials, 355 women). A higher proportion of women taking norethisterone found their treatment unacceptable compared to women having Pg-IUS (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.40; 1 trial, 40 women). However, the adverse effects of breast tenderness and intermenstrual bleeding were more likely in women with the LNG-IUS. No trials reported on days of bleeding or quality of life for this comparison.The evidence supporting these findings was limited by low or very low gradings of quality; thus, we are uncertain about the findings and there is a potential that they may change if we identify other trials.Low- or very low-quality evidence suggests that short-course progestogen was inferior to other medical therapy, including tranexamic acid, danazol and the Pg-IUS with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss. Long cycle progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone  or norethisterone) was also inferior to the LNG-IUS, tranexamic acid and ormeloxifene, but may be similar to the combined vaginal ring with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31366183>Harvesting at the Right Time: Maturity and Its Effects on the Aromatic Characteristics of Cabernet Sauvignon Wine.</a></h2><p>The aim of this paper was to investigate how maturity affects the aroma characteristics of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. A series of four  cv. Cabernet Sauvignon wines were produced from grapes of different harvest dates. The berries of sequential harvest treatments showed an increase in total soluble solids and anthocyanin and a decrease in titratable acidity. Berry shriveling was observed as berry  decreased. In the wines, anthocyanin, dry extract, alcoholic strength, and pH were enhanced with the sequential harvest, whereas polyphenol and tannin were decreased. The concentrations of volatile compounds in sequential harvests were found to be at higher levels. Isopentanol, phenylethyl alcohol, ethyl , ethyl lactate, benzaldehyde, citronellol, and linalool significantly increased when harvest was delayed by one or two weeks. Through a principal component analysis, the volatile compounds and phenols characterizing each harvest date were clearly differentiated. These results suggest that sequential harvest may be an optional strategy for winemakers to produce high-quality wine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31270736>Antiinflammatory constituents of Atractylodes chinensis rhizome improve glomerular lesions in immunoglobulin A nephropathy model mice.</a></h2><p>The crude drug Sojutsu, as defined by the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, is the rhizome of Atractylodes lancea De Candolle, Atractylodes chinensis Koidzumi, or their interspecific hybrids (Asteraceae). Sojutsu is one of the traditional Kampo formulas, which are administered to patients suffering from stomach disorders, edema, and nephrotic syndrome. Although antiinflammatory effects of Sojutsu have been reported, its effects on the liver and kidney have not been extensively investigated. Here, we used a Sojutsu sample identified as A. chinensis rhizome and isolated several constituents from its ethyl  (EtOAc)-soluble fraction that decreased production of the proinflammatory mediator nitric oxide (NO) in interleukin 1β-treated rat hepatocytes. Among the constituents in this fraction, atractylodin showed the highest activity to suppress NO production, whereas hinesol, β-eudesmol, and α-bisabolol showed low activity. Atractylodin decreased the levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor α, and lipocalin 2 messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The EtOAc-soluble fraction of the A. chinensis rhizome extract was administered daily for 20 weeks to high immunoglobulin A (HIGA) mice, whose pathological findings resemble human immunoglobulin A nephropathy. This fraction decreased the  of white adipose tissue and decreased mesangial proliferation and immunoglobulin A deposition in glomeruli. These results indicate that the EtOAc-soluble fraction, which included antiinflammatory constituents, may be responsible for improvement of the mesangial lesions in HIGA mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31265886>Anti-inflammatory and phytochemical evaluation of Combretum aculeatum Vent growing in Sudan.</a></h2><p>Combretum aculeatum Vent was traditionally used in Sudan, Eretria and Ethiopia as anti-inflammatory in case of skin inflammation, catarrh, wounds, scorpion stings and snake bites. Nevertheless, there is no scientific information regarding this activity.The present study aimed to evaluate the phytochemical constituents and the scientific basis for the traditional use of Combretum aculeatum Vent through studying its anti-inflammatory properties for the first time to illustrate the putative mechanisms behind this bioactivity.the ethanolic extract was partitioned by petroleum ether, methylene chloride, ethyl , and n-butanol saturated with water. The petroleum ether fraction was saponified and the saponifiable and unsaponifiable fractions were analyzed on GC/MS. The different fractions were subjected to phytochemical investigation to isolate pure compounds. In-vivo anti-inflammatory activity of the ethanolic extract was evaluated using carrageenan induced rat paws edema method at doses of 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg and proved based on histopathological and biochemical parameters.Five known compounds were isolated for the first time from the aerial parts of Combretum aculeatum Vent: quercetin, vitexin, isorhamnetin 3-O-β-glucoside, isovitexin and rutin, in addition to two previously isolated ones: β-sitosterol and its glucoside. The ethanolic extract evidenced in-vivo anti-inflammatory activity by oral intake of 400 mg/kg of the ethanolic extract significantly (P ≥ 0.05) decreased the paw edema (only 32±1.9% increase in paw  after 4 h) compared to indomethacin (28.6±2.5%). Moreover, it significantly suppressed the serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) and increased the GSH to be 11.76±0.85, 5.13±0.62 μmol/mL and 5.66±0.28 μM/mL, respectively. It diminished the serum cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β levels to be 39.1±1.2, 32.6±1.1 and 37.5±1.2 pg/mL, respectively. Results are accompanied by histopathological examination.Overall, the results herein presented significant anti-inflammatory properties traditionally ascribed to Combretum aculeatum Vent. Moreover, the biochemical mechanisms associated to this action were highlighted, introducing new prospects for the development of effective anti-inflammatory herbal medicinal products.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Also, lupeol  (main compound, 49.7 mg/g of dry extract) and scopoletin (0.19 mg/g of dry extract) were quantified by HPLC analysis from this organic extract. The protective activity of the C. chayamansa organic extract against hepatotoxicity induced by antitubercular drugs [Rifampicin (50 mg/kg), Isoniazid (50 mg/kg), and Pyrazinamide (100 mg/kg)] are reported. The extract was tested at 200 and 400 mg/kg in Balb/C mice during 85 days, using silymarin (2.5 mg/kg) as positive control. Liver damage was determined using biochemical parameters (AST, ALT, ALP, CHOL, HDL TG, Urea, and CREA), histological analysis, and evaluation of oxidative stress (SOD, CAT, Gpx, Lpx and POx). The extract at both doses favored  gain with respect to the anti-TB group; the dose of 200 mg/kg was better. Also, the extract at both doses decreased the values of transaminases (AST, ALT) enzymes (p < 0.05) vs. anti-TB group. In oxidative stress parameters, the SOD value was decreased, as were the levels of peroxidation of lipids and oxidative protein in the group with C. chayamansa extract at 200 and 400 mg/kg vs. the anti-TB group. Histological analyses from liver showed the absence of steatosis in the extract group at 400 mg/kg, and moderate steatosis in the silymarin and extract (at 200 mg/kg) groups with respect to anti-TB group, which demonstrated a steatosis. It should be noted that during the study period, none of the treated mice died. In conclusion, the CHCl: MeOH extract of C. chayamansa has a hepatoprotective effect against hepatotoxicity induced by anti-TB drugs.Copyright © 2019.

We hypothesized that faster growth in early infancy may be associated with maternal PFAS concentrations.Among 415 mother-infant pairs in a longitudinal cohort study, we estimated associations between maternal pregnancy serum concentrations of six PFAS and offspring  and adiposity at ~5 months of age, and growth in early infancy. Linear and logistic regression models were adjusted for potential confounders including maternal pre-pregnancy  mass index. Effect modification by infant sex was evaluated. We evaluated potential confounding by correlated exposures via multipollutant linear regression and elastic net penalized regression.Associations between maternal PFAS concentrations and infant  and adiposity differed by offspring sex. In male infants, maternal perfluorooctanoate and perfluorononanoate were positively associated with adiposity, with percent fat mass increases of 1.5-1.7% per ln-ng/mL increase in PFAS (median adiposity at ~5 months: 24.6%). Maternal perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) were associated with lower -for-age z-score among female infants only (-0.26 SD per ln-ng/mL PFOS, 95% CI -0.43, -0.10; -0.17 SD per ln-ng/mL PFHxS, 95% CI -0.33, -0.01). In analyses pooled by sex, 2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido)  above vs. below the limit of detection was associated with greater odds of rapid growth in -for-age (odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.1, 4.3) and -for-length (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.8, 6.2). Multipollutant models generally confirmed the results and strengthened some associations.We observed sex- and chemical-specific associations between maternal serum PFAS concentrations and infant  and adiposity. Multipollutant models suggested confounding by correlated PFAS with opposing effects. Although maternal PFAS concentrations are inversely associated with infant  and adiposity at birth, rapid gain may occur in infancy, particularly in fat mass.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Ingestion of the prebiotic Bimuno™ galacto-oligosaccharide (B-GOS) is one such intervention that has been shown to attenuate olanzapine-induced  gain and improve cognitive flexibility in rats, potentially through mechanisms involving , the major short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) that is produced by B-GOS fermentation. The present study investigated the individual influences of B-GOS and sodium  intake on brain histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities, cortical and hippocampal expression of HDAC1-4 and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunits in saline or olanzapine injected female rats. The effect of sodium  on olanzapine-induced  gain was also investigated. Daily ingestion of B-GOS for 21 days, reduced HDAC activity and hippocampal HDAC-4, and elevated levels of cortical HDAC-1 and HDAC-3 mRNAs. Sodium  supplementation significantly decreased HAT, but not HDAC, activity and increased hippocampal HDAC-3 and HDAC-4 mRNAs. Olanzapine-induced  gain and fourteen genera of intestinal bacteria, were not influenced by sodium  intake. Together these data suggests the effects of B-GOS in rats cannot be replicated by  ingestion, and that mechanisms beyond the production of this SCFA are likely to underlie the psychotropic and metabolic actions of this prebiotic.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 20 newborn male Holstein calves (3 d of age; 40.3 ± 1.30 kg of ; ±SE) were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 treatments, a starter feed containing either 10% dry (AH) or reconstituted alfalfa hay (RAH), each consisting of 10 calves. Alfalfa hay was reconstituted with water 24 h before feeding to achieve a theoretical dry matter content of 20%. Both starter feeds had the same ingredients and nutrient compositions but differed in their dry matter content (91.2 and 83.8% dry matter for AH and RAH, respectively). Calves were weaned on d 50 and remained on the study until d 70. All calves had free access to fresh and clean drinking water and the starter feed at all times. During the study period, the average maximum temperature-humidity index was 73.8 units, indicating no degree of environmental heat load for dairy calves. Starter feed dry matter intake, total dry matter intake, and  (at weaning and at the end of the trial) were unaffected by treatment. Nutrient intake (except for total ether extract intake) increased during the postweaning period compared with the preweaning period. Average daily gain and feed efficiency were unchanged between treatments. Calves had higher average daily gain and skeletal growth during the postweaning period; however, feed efficiency was lower during the post- versus preweaning period. Calves fed RAH gained more hip width and  barrel compared with calves fed AH during the preweaning and all studied periods, respectively. Rectal temperature was similar between treatments, but feeding RAH decreased fecal score and general appearance score during the preweaning period. Apparent total-tract nutrient digestibility was not affected by reconstitution of alfalfa hay; however, reconstitution increased total-tract digestibility of neutral detergent fiber during the postweaning period. Ruminal fluid pH, and concentrations and profile of total volatile fatty acids were unchanged between treatments. Molar concentration of propionate and  to propionate ratio increased and decreased, respectively, during the postweaning period. Reconstitution of alfalfa hay did not affect concentrations of glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate, blood urea N, and albumin, and albumin to globulin ratio during the studied periods; however, reconstitution increased concentration of blood total protein during the overall period. Calves had higher concentrations of blood glucose and globulin during the preweaning and β-hydroxybutyrate during the postweaning period. Overall, reconstitution of alfalfa hay did not interact with calf phase (pre- vs. postweaning) to affect dry matter intake, growth performance, and metabolic indications of rumen development (measured as ruminal volatile fatty acids and selected blood metabolites), but improved health-related variables (fecal score and general appearance score) during the preweaning period.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

An important leading complication of diabetes is a degenerative effect on the reproductive system including infertility and gonadal dysfunction. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of experimental type I and II diabetes on the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone.Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four separate groups: (1) type I diabetes (T1DM), (2) type II diabetes (T2DM), (3) cetrorelix -treated nondiabetic control group, and (4) normal untreated group (n = 6). T1DM was experimentally induced by a single injection of alloxan (135 mg/kg) while T2DM was induced by feeding the animals with drinking water enriched with fructose (10%). Cetrorelix  (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal for 1 week) treatment group was used as a positive control. All rats were killed and blood and testes were collected after 8 weeks of the study. The effects of induced diabetes on the levels of blood glucose and insulin were assessed. The levels of sex hormones and insulin were determined by radioimmunoassay. Histological staining was used to check abnormal patterns of testicular morphology, the diameter of seminiferous tubules, testicular diameter, and germinal layer thickness.A significant reduction in the testosterone, FSH, and LH levels were observed in T1DM, T2DM, and also in cetrorelix -treated groups. Analysis of testicular histology sections revealed significantly reduced thickness of cell layer in T1DM and cetrorelix -treated groups compared with the T2DM group. In T2DM, the cell numbers, the thickness of cell layer, the diameter of seminiferous tubules, and  of testicles were slightly increased. In contrast, total tubules of empty seminiferous increased significantly in T1D and cetrorelix treated groups compared with the control group.Overall, diabetes can induce hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis dysfunction, affects hormonal secretion, and causes histological damage to testes, collectively leading to deleterious effects on male fertility.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825168>Methods for Hyaluronan Molecular Mass Determination by Agarose Gel Electrophoresis.</a></h2><p>The average molecular mass of hyaluronan (HA) in most healthy biological fluids and tissues is usually about 6000-8000 kDa, but the biosynthetic mechanism results in a polydisperse mixture of sizes. Subsequent enzymatic degradation, or the action of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, can further increase polydispersity and decrease the average size. Fragmented HA can be a biomarker of inflammation. In addition, reductions in HA size are associated with tissue remodeling and repair processes. Some cell-surface receptor proteins have been reported to have HA-binding affinities that are size specific, and participate in activation of signaling cascades controlling multiple aspects of cell behavior.

In most cases, multiple agents are required to control cancer progression. The purpose of this study is to investigate, using a mouse model, the synergistic interactions of anti-cancer agents, 1'-S-1'-acetoxychavicol  (ACA),  (MIP), and cisplatin (CDDP) in double and triple combinations to treat chemo-sensitize and immune-sensitize breast cancer. Changes in tumor volume and  were monitored. Organs were harvested and stained using hematoxylin-eosin for histopathological assessment. Milliplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to determine cytokine levels, while immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted on tumor biopsies to verify systemic drug effects. In vivo mouse models showed tumor regression with maintenance of regular  for all the different treatment regimens. IHC results provided conclusive evidence indicating that combination regimens were able to down-regulate nuclear factor kappa-B activation and reduce the expression of its regulated pro-inflammatory proteins. Reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-ɣ) levels were observed when using the triple combination, which indicated that the synergistic drug combination was able to significantly control cancer progression. In conclusion, ACA, MIP, and CDDP together serve as promising candidates for further development and for subsequent clinical trials against estrogen-sensitive breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31386884>Effect on the offspring of pregnant females CD-1 mice treated with a single thallium(I) application.</a></h2><p>Thallium (Tl) is a highly toxic metal for human beings; higher amounts found in diverse fluids of pregnant women are associated with low birth  and preterm birth.

The timed release of EB based on microspheres is one of the effective methods to solve this issue. As a non-toxic cellulose ester, cellulose  butyrate (CAB) is regarded as one of the best wall-forming materials for microcapsules with a good controlled release performance. Herein, two methods-mechanical activation (MA) technology and a conventional liquid phase (LP) method-were employed to synthesize different CABs, namely CAB-MA and CAB-LP, respectively. The molecular structure, rheological property, and thermal stability of these CABs were investigated. The two CABs were used to prepare microspheres for the loading and release of EB via an o/w (oil-in-water) solvent evaporation method. Moreover, the performances such as drug loading, drug entrapment, and anti-photolysis of the drug for these microspheres were studied. The results showed that both CABs were available as wall materials for loading and releasing EB. Compared with CAB-LP, CAB-MA presented a lower molecular  and a narrower molecular  distribution. Moreover, the MA method endowed the CAB with more ester substituent groups and less crystalline structure in comparison to the LP method, which had benefits including pelletizing and drug loading.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664980>Diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism as a first presentation of silent adenocarcinoma of lung: a case report and literature review.</a></h2><p>Pituitary metastasis is a rare condition with a poor prognosis. Very few patients with pituitary metastasis are symptomatic. It is often associated with presence of co-existing metastases to other organs. Isolated pituitary metastasis as the first presentation of primary malignancy is uncommon.A 72-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of polyuria, increasing thirst and unexplained  loss. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was scheduled as part of the investigation. She was kept nil per os for 10 h prior to EGD, after which she developed alteration of consciousness. Further investigation revealed hypernatremia with sodium level of 161 mmol/L and low urine osmolality of 62 mOsm/kg. Her urine output was 300 mL per hour. Diabetes insipidus (DI) was diagnosed based on evidence of polyuria, hypernatremia, and low urine osmolality. Her urine output decreased and urine osmolality increased to 570 mOsm/kg in response to subcutaneous desmopressin , confirming central DI. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneous gadolinium enhancing lesion at the sellar and suprasellar regions, measuring 2.4 × 2.6 × 3.9 cm compressing both the hypothalamus bilaterally and the inferior aspect of optic chiasm as well as displacing the residual pituitary gland anteriorly. The posterior pituitary bright spot was absent. These MRI findings suggested pituitary macroadenoma. There were also multiple small gadolinium-enhancing lesions up to 0.7 cm in size with adjacent vasogenic brain edema at the subcortical and subpial regions of the left frontal and parietal areas, raising the concern of brain metastases. Pituitary hormonal evaluation was consistent with panhypopituitarism. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies of the pituitary tissue revealed an adenocarcinoma, originating from the lung. Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen was subsequently performed, showing a 2.2-cm soft tissue mass at the proximal part of right bronchus. There was no evidence of distant metastases elsewhere. The final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma of the lung with pituitary metastasis manifesting as panhypopituitarism and central DI. Palliative care along with hormonal replacement therapy was offered to the patient. She died 4 months after diagnosis.Diagnosis of pituitary metastasis is challenging, especially in patients with previously undiagnosed primary cancer. It should be considered in the elderly patients presenting with new-onset central DI with or without anterior pituitary dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947128>Quantification of estradiol cypionate in plasma by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry: Application in a pharmacokinetic study in healthy female volunteers.</a></h2><p>The combination of medroxyprogesterone  25 mg + estradiol cypionate 5 mg is a highly effective, monthly injectable contraceptive. For the first time, this study presents the development and validation of a sensitive method for estradiol cypionate analysis in human plasma by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Aliquots (500 μL) of plasma were extracted with ethyl ether (100%) and derivatized with dansyl chloride. Its separation was performed on a Jones Chromatography Genesis C8 column and the quantification was performed with a mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface operating in negative ion mode. The run time was 6 min and the calibration curve was linear over the range of 0.005-0.15 ng/mL. The method was applied to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of estradiol cypionate in plasma collected up to 1008 h (42 days) after a single intramuscular administration of 25 mg/mL medroxyprogesterone  +5 mg/mL estradiol cypionate to healthy female volunteers (n = 12).

This is the first report of low molecular  gelators (LMWG) from DCU derivatives of amino acids. The self-assembly mechanism of the organogels has been probed using concentration dependent 1H NMR, DMSO titration 1H NMR, fluorescence, FTIR, PXRD and FESEM techniques. Self-assembly leading to gelation process is mainly driven by hydrophobicity and π-π stacking interactions in between Fmoc groups. Interestingly, the gels can absorb several kinds of organic dyes efficiently and can be reused for dye absorption for multiple cycles. Additionally, M1-M3 act as sensors for anions like fluoride,  and hydroxide, for which they have specific fluorescence response. Gel formation by M1-M3 is completely arrested in the presence of fluoride. The possible binding mode of fluoride has been delineated using DFT studies. Calculations suggest, involvement of urea NH in a six membered intramolecular hydrogen bond, rendering it unavailable for fluoride binding. Backbone -NH of the amino acids of M1-M3 is responsible for fluoride binding. The reported small, economically viable, synthetically facile molecules not only enrich the repertoire of LMWG molecules, but can have multifaceted applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311119>Early Feeding Regime of Waste Milk, Milk, and Milk Replacer for Calves Has Different Effects on Rumen Fermentation and the Bacterial Community.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effects of different types of early feeding on rumen fermentation parameters and the bacterial community in calves. Fifty-four Holstein calves were assigned to three treatments and fed whole milk (M), pasteurized waste milk (WM), or milk replacer (MR). Male calves were slaughtered at the age of two months to measure the stomach masses. The female calves were followed for six months to determine the , blood indices, rumen fermentation, and ruminal bacterial community. At the age of two months, the average daily gain was lower, but the concentration of total volatile fatty acids was greater in the MR group. Starter intake and stomach mass were lower, but the isovalerate molar proportion was greater in the WM group. The blood indices and ruminal bacterial community of the WM group differed from those of the other groups. At the age of six months, the ruminal propionate molar proportion was lower, but the ruminal pH and /propionate ratio were greater in the MR group. In conclusion, calves fed WM had different rumen fermentation and bacterial community during the weaning period, whereas feeding MR produced a long-lasting effect on the rumen environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972390>Effects of dietary supplementation with yeast glycoprotein on growth performance, intestinal mucosal morphology, immune response and colonic microbiota in weaned piglets.</a></h2><p>Antibiotics are commonly provided to weaned piglets; however, this practice has become controversial due to the increased occurrences of microbial resistance, and alternatives are needed. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with yeast glycoprotein (YG) on growth performance, intestinal mucosal morphology, immune response and colonic microbiota in weaned piglets. A total of 240 weaned piglets (d 23 ± 2) from 16 pens (15 piglets per pen) were randomly allocated to an antibiotics group (25% quinocetone 200 mg kg-1 and 4% enduracidin 800 mg kg-1 of the basal diet) or a YG group (800 mg kg-1 YG of the basal diet), respectively. The trial lasted 14 days, and at the end of the trial, one piglet per pen was chosen to collect plasma, intestinal tissue and colonic digesta samples. The results indicate that piglets fed diets containing YG tended to show increased final  (0.05 < P < 0.1), increased average daily gain (P < 0.05) and decreased F/G (P < 0.05) when compared with the antibiotics group. Moreover, intestinal permeability showed that YG led to an improvement in the intestinal development via decreasing serum content of DAO (P < 0.01). Histological evaluations showed that YG contributed to the improvement of the intestinal development via increasing villous height (P < 0.05) and the villous height to crypt depth ratio (P < 0.01), and decreasing crypt depth (P < 0.01) and villous width (P < 0.05) in the ileum. Intestinal integrity also showed that YG was conducive to improvement of the intestinal development via upregulating the m-RNA expression of occludin (P < 0.05) in the duodenal and jejunal mucosa. Interestingly, YG supplementation downregulated the m-RNA expression of IL-12 (P < 0.05), upregulated the m-RNA expression of Hsp-70 (P < 0.05) in the duodenal mucosa, downregulated the m-RNA expression of Hsp-70 (P < 0.05) and IFN-γ (P < 0.05), upregulated the m-RNA expression of Hsp-90 (P < 0.05) in the jejunal mucosa, and upregulated the m-RNA expression of Hsp-70 (P < 0.05) in the ileal mucosa. On the other hand, colonic microbiota results showed that YG supplementation increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus (P < 0.05) in the genus level. Colonic metabolite results showed that YG supplementation decreased the content of  (P < 0.05).

Ten Japanese Black fattening steers (aged 26 months) were randomly divided into control and KP groups. The control group (n = 5) was fed concentrate feed without KP, and the KP group (n = 5) was fed concentrate feed containing 10% KP. Both the groups were provided rice straw as roughage. The experiment was conducted over a period of 12 weeks. There was no significant difference in dry matter intake, daily  gain, and nutrient digestibility between both groups. No difference was observed in the ruminal concentrations of volatile fatty acids among the groups. At weeks 8 and 12 after the onset of the experiment, the -to-propionate ratio in the ruminal fluid of the KP group was significantly higher than that of the control group. The average daily pH of ruminal fluid and activity of ruminal lipopolysaccharide did not differ between the groups. Our results suggested that the growth performance and feed digestibility in the Japanese Black fattening steers were not influenced by replacing concentrate feed with KP.© 2019 The Authors.

The melt viscosities of bulk polymer and physical mixtures with different concentrations of selected APIs were analyzed by using a rheometer. The rheological evaluation revealed both the suitable temperature range for melt extrusion process and drug-polymer extrudability. The effect of formulation and processing parameters (e.g. polymer/drug ratio, temperature, screw speed) on extrudability were evaluated in terms of torque and residence time analysis. The extrudates obtained via hot melt extrusion (HME) processing exhibited good flow and compressibility. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction studies examined the change in glass transition temperature (Tg) and crystalline pattern of extruded formulations where all extruded formulations seemed to have retained their crystallinity. The thermogravimetric analysis determined the thermal stability ( loss) as a function of operating temperature whereas scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed agglomerated microstructure and rough surface with a porous network and void spaces. The tablets obtained after compression of milled extrudates showed excellent hardness with robust tablet characteristics. The in vitro release studies of individual batches performed in various USP recommended dissolution media (for paracetamol) showed the pH-independent release of the hydrophilic drugs from the polymer matrices.Copyright © 2019.

Traditional psoriasis treatments often cause side effects, drug resistance and complications, necessitating development of safer and more effective treatments. In this study, we screened over 600 natural compounds to identify viability inhibitors of human HaCaT keratinocytes cultured in vitro. The results showed that nitidine chloride was a highly effective inhibitor. Further studies revealed that nitidine chloride inhibited HaCaT proliferation and induced S phase cell cycle arrest; these effects were associated with reduced DNA synthesis, decreased Ki67, cyclin A, and cyclin D1 levels, and increased p53 protein expression. Nitidine chloride also significantly downregulated bcl-2 and upregulated bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3. Mechanistic studies revealed that nitidine chloride-induced apoptosis involved the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. More importantly, in 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13- (TPA)- and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation models, nitidine chloride inhibited topical edema in mouse ear and back skin, substantially reducing tissue thickness and . In some cases, nitidine chloride also ameliorated conditions caused by TPA and IMQ, such as angiogenesis and infiltration of large numbers of inflammatory cells around blood vessels. Additionally, nitidine chloride inhibited the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines in the two animal models. In conclusion, our results are the first to demonstrate that nitidine chloride inhibits the proliferation of HaCaT cells, induces apoptosis partly via the JNK signaling pathway in vitro and ameliorates skin lesions and inflammation in vivo, making it an appropriate candidate for psoriasis treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that MS and NMR spectra have been combined to determine the PDI of complex products derived from protein hydrolysis that are not monodisperse. The performance of each method was evaluated by comparing the obtained results to those reported for glatiramer  using MALLS, the technique commonly employed to determine PDI.

This model of water intoxication (WI) results in extreme pathological changes and death within 1 hr. To improve preclinical studies of the pathophysiology of elevated ICP, we characterized diuresis, cardiovascular parameters, blood ionogram and effects of antidiuretics in this model. We subsequently developed a new mouse model with mild hyponatremia and sustained increased ICP. To investigate the classical protocol (severe WI), C57BL/6mice were anesthetized and received an intraperitoneal injection of 20%  of MilliQ water with or without 0.4 µg·kg desmopressin  (dDAVP). Corresponding Sham groups were also studied. In the new WI protocol (mild WI), 10%  of a solution containing 6.5 mM NaHCO, 1.125 mM KCl and 29.75 mM NaCl was intraperitoneally injected. By severe WI, ICP and mean arterial pressure increased until brain stem herniation occurred (23 ± 3 min after injection). The cardiovascular effects were accelerated by dDAVP. Severe WI induced a halt to urine production irrespective of the use of dDAVP. Following the new mild WI protocol, ICP also increased but was sustained at a pathologically high level without inducing herniation. Mean arterial pressure and urine production were not affected during mild WI. In conclusion, the new mild WI protocol is a superior experimental model to study the pathophysiological effects of elevated ICP induced by water intoxication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618914>Effects of Nutritional Deprivation and Re-Alimentation on the Feed Efficiency, Blood Biochemistry, and Rumen Microflora in Yaks ().</a></h2><p>Yak suffers severe starvation and  reduction in the cold season and recovers relatively rapid growth in the warm season every year. Herein, we investigated the effects of starvation and refeeding on the growth, feed efficiency, blood biochemistry and rumen microbial community as well as functions of yaks. The results showed that starvation significantly reduced the  of yaks. Serum glucose and triglyceride concentrations significantly decreased, and β-hydroxybutyric acid and non-esterified fatty acid levels were significantly increased during the starvation period. Starvation also dramatically inhibited rumen microbial fermentations. Whereas, refeeding with the same diet significantly increased the feed efficiency, nutrient digestibility together with rumen , propionate and microbial protein productions compared with those before starvation. The 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that starvation mainly decreased the ruminal protein-degrading bacteria  and propionate-producing bacteria  populations and dramatically increased the denitrifying bacteria  populations. Refeeding reduced the  population and increased propionate-producing bacteria  and starch-degrading bacteria  populations when compared with those before starvation. The predicted microbial metabolic pathways, related to amino acid and starch metabolisms, were also significantly altered during the starvation and refeeding. The results indicated that the rumen microorganisms and their metabolism pathways changed with feed supply, and these alterations in part contributed to yak adaption to starvation and re-alimentation. This study is helpful for enhancing the understanding and utilization of this natural character of yaks to explore and improve their growth potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31054992>Characterization of branched poly(lactide-co-glycolide) polymers used in injectable, long-acting formulations.</a></h2><p>Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) has been used in many injectable, long-acting depot formulations. Despite frequent use of PLGA, however, its characterization has been limited to measuring its molecular , lactide:glycolide (L:G) ratio, and end-group. These conventional methods are not adequate for characterization of unique PLGA polymers, such as branched PLGA. Glucose-initiated PLGA (Glu-PLGA) has been used in Sandostatin® LAR Depot (octreotide  for injectable suspension) approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998. Glu-PLGA is a branched (also known as star-shaped) polymer and determining its properties has been challenging. It is necessary to develop methods that can determine and characterize the branching parameters of Glu-PLGA. Such characterization is important not only for the quality control of formulations, but also for developing generic parenteral formulations that are required to have the same excipients in the same amount (qualitative/quantitative (Q1/Q2) sameness) as their Reference Listed Drug (RLD). In this study, an analytical technique was developed and validated using a series of branched-PLGA standards, and it was used to determine the branching parameters of Glu-PLGA extracted from Sandostatin LAR, as well as Glu-PLGAs obtained from three different manufacturers. The analytical technique was based on gel-permeation-chromatography with quadruple detection systems (GPC-4D). GPC-4D enabled characterization of Glu-PLGA in its concentration, absolute molecular , hydrodynamic radius and intrinsic viscosity. The plot of the branch units per molecule as a function of molar mass provides a unique profile of each branched PLGA. The Mark-Houwink plots were also used to distinguish different Glu-PLGAs. These ensemble identification methods indicate that the branch units of Glu-PLGAs extracted from Sandostatin LAR range from 2 (i.e., linear) at the lower end of the molecular  to <4 for the majority (94%) of Glu-PLGA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the underlying mechanism of its anti-inflammatory effect is poorly understood.In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of EtOAc fractions of H. attenuatum Choisy (Ha-EtOAc) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophage inflammation and hypothesized that Ha-EtOAc could attenuate inflammation in the colon.LPS was utilized to induce RAW264.7 cells inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effect of Ha-EtOAc in RAW264.7 cells was evaluated by measuring the inhibition ratio of nitric oxide (NO) production. Murine ulcerative colitis (UC) was induced by treatment with 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The basic indexes of the mice, including , food intake and hematochezia, were recorded during mice experiments.The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Additionally, the influences of Ha-EtOAc on the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways were determined by western blot and immunofluorescence assays. In addition, the impact of Ha-EtOAc on gut microbiota of mice with UC was detected by 16S rDNA sequencing.Ha-EtOAc inhibited the LPS-induced production of NO and decreased the release of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment with Ha-EtOAc could suppress the nuclear translocation of p65 and the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38 and JNK. Ha-EtOAc treatment ameliorated murine UC, as reflected by a reduced  loss, improved colon shortening, alleviated mucosal damage and decreased releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, Ha-EtOAc could modulate the composition of microbial communities.Our results demonstrated that Ha-EtOAc exhibited anti-inflammatory effects mainly by suppressing the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, and Ha-EtOAc treatment may be a potent therapy for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Reactive oxygen species contains oxygen radicals that easily react with other molecules in the biological system. For decades, lead  (Pb(CHO2)) is used as an additive for many widely used chemical products such as insecticides, hair dyes, and cosmetics; however, contact with lead  may irritate skin, eyes, and mucous membranes.In the present study, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of using ferulic acid to inhibit lead -induced toxicity in rats is investigated. Lead  was orally given at a dose of 20 mg/kg  for 10 days, either alone or with ferulic acid at dose 25 mg/kg. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH), total testosterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were measured. Also, reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation (LPO), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and catalase (CAT) activities were determined. In addition, histopathological changes of testes and kidney were examined. Results showed that administration of lead  induced oxidative stress through attenuation of luteinizing hormone, total testosterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in serum. Moreover, the kidney and testes of lead -treated animals exhibited elevation of ROS level, lipid peroxide levels, as well as lysosomal enzyme activity such acid phosphatase and N-acetyl-β-glucosminidase. DNA fragmentation and histological changes were also observed in lead -treated group. In contrast, ferulic acid treatment reduced the deleterious effects induced by lead  in both testes and kidney tissues. These results illustrated that ferulic acid has a protective action against toxicity caused by lead  in rats. In conclusions, ferulic acid may have future therapeutic relevance in the prevention of lead -induced testicular and renal toxicity in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31239867> Extract Alleviates Memory Impairment through Increasing CREB/BDNF via Suppression of p38MAPK/ERK Pathway in Ovariectomized Rats.</a></h2><p> is a very important traditional Chinese medicine for tonifying the kidney, which has a significant effect on improving estrogen level on the long term. In many studies, it can improve the learning and memory function of ovariectomized (OVX) model animals. 10 of the 50 rats received only bilateral back surgery and were harvested with the same amount of fat as the ovaries without removing the ovaries as sham group; remains underwent bilateral ovariectomy and equally randomized into five groups: sham group, with OVX as model group, estradiol valerate (EV, 0.2 mg/kg) as positive control, with 3.3 and 33 mg/kg /day of ethyl  extract of  extract (CSE) as low and high dosage groups, respectively. The orally administered CSE to ovariectomized rats exerted an ameliorative effect on learning and memory in the Morris water maze tests. All rats were sacrificed after 8 weeks of treatment, and tissue was analyzed using histopathology and electron microscopy. To comprehensively examine the mechanism, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), p-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-p38MAPK), extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), p-extracellular regulated protein kinases (p-ERK), and p-cAMP-response element binding protein (p-CREB) were detected by Western blotting. Using histopathology and electron microscopy, it was clearly observed that the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal CA1 area were reduced in the OVX groups, indicating that CSE could attenuate the loss of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal CA1 and revert the synaptic morphological variations produced by ovariectomy. Mechanistically, the expressions of p-p38MAPK and p-ERK levels were significantly downregulated by CSE intervention, whereas the BDNF and p-CREB were significantly upregulated by CSE as compared to the control. Concisely,  exhibited potential therapeutic effect on Neuroprotection of ovariectomized rats, and its effect was possibly exerted by p-CREB/BDNF mediated down regulation of ERK/p38MAPK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601896>Ricinus communis L. fruit extract inhibits migration/invasion, induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells and arrests tumor progression in vivo.</a></h2><p>Medicinal plant-based therapies can be important for treatment of cancer owing to high efficiency, low cost and minimal side effects. Here, we report the anti-cancer efficacy of Ricinus communis L. fruit extract (RCFE) using estrogen positive MCF-7 and highly aggressive, triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. RCFE induced cytotoxicity in these cells in dose and time-dependent manner. It also demonstrated robust anti-metastatic activity as it significantly inhibited migration, adhesion, invasion and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9 in both cell lines. Further, flow cytometry analysis suggested RCFE-mediated induction of apoptosis in these cells. This was supported by attenuation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, induction of pro-apoptotic Bax and caspase-7 expressions as well as PARP cleavage upon RCFE treatment. RCFE (0.5 mg/Kg ) treatment led to significant reduction in tumor volume in 4T1 syngeneic mouse model. HPLC and ESI-MS analysis of active ethyl  fraction of RCFE detected four compounds, Ricinine, p-Coumaric acid, Epigallocatechin and Ricinoleic acid. Individually these compounds showed cytotoxic and migration-inhibitory activities. Overall, this study for the first time demonstrates the anti-cancer efficacy of the fruit extract of common castor plant which can be proposed as a potent candidate for the treatment of breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31111377>Urine NMR Metabolomic Study on Biochemical Activities to Investigate the Effect of P. betle Extract on Obese Rats.</a></h2><p>The present studies are to evaluate the ability of PB to induce  loss and urine metabolite profile of Piper betle L.

Sixty Simmental × Yellow Cattle crossbred bulls were blocked by initial  (BW; 324.0 ± 5.4 kg) into 15 blocks. Animals in each block were randomly assigned to one of four diets formulated based on the following corn silage: control (CON), inoculated with complex lactic acid bacteria (CLB), ensilaged with mixed organic acid salts (MS), and ensilaged with CLB and MS (CLBMS). The feeding experiment lasted over 155 days, with an additional 7 days for adaptation. The results showed that bulls fed CLB-inoculated silage had greater ( < 0.05) daily dry matter intake than the other groups. The experimental treatment had no significant effect on average daily gain ( = 0.33) and feed-to-gain ratio ( = 0.13), although bulls fed CLB-inoculated silage had a larger numeric average daily gain. All additive-treated silage increased ruminal NH-N content ( < 0.05) and reduced the -to-propionate ratio ( < 0.05) of bulls compared with the control group. Bulls fed CLB-inoculated silage had a lower ruminal pH value ( < 0.05) than that of the other groups. Compared with the control group, bulls fed CLB-inoculated silage had greater blood cholesterol, albumin, and urea nitrogen ( < 0.05). Blood physiological responses were similar in bulls fed MS-treated and control silage, whereas those in cattle fed CLBMS-treated silage were between bulls fed CLB- and MS-treated silages and more similar to the former. Taking animal performance and cost effectiveness into consideration, the application of CLB alone to whole corn crops at ensiling appears to be a better choice compared with the application of either MS alone or both of them together.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31080485>Phytochemical and Safety Evaluation of Hydroethanolic Leaf Extract of  (L.)

It is reported to have significant pharmacological activity and has gained attention by natives of various cultures. This study focused on the phytoconstituents screening, antioxidant activity, and heavy metal analysis as well as the acute and subchronic toxicity of the hydroethanolic leaf extract (TSE) using standard methods. The presence of flavonoids, alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, saponins, coumarins, and terpenoids in the raw leaf of the plant was observed while the hydroethanolic extract contained coumarins, saponins, cardiac glycosides, and flavonoids. The DPPH percentage scavenging activity of the crude extract was 64.32% while the fractions, ethyl  (55.26%), methanol (60.72%), and hydro (36.97%.), gave varying activities. The UV-Vis and FT-IR indicated the presence of alcohols, phenols, alkanes, alkenes, carbonyls (general), aliphatic amines, aromatics, ketones, ethers, esters, carboxylic acids, alkyl halides, saturated aliphatic acids, 1° and 2° amines, amides, and ,-unsaturated aldehydes. The heavy metal analysis showed a high level of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) in the raw leaf. The median acute toxicity (LD) of the extract was determined to be <5000mg/kg  in mice. Subchronic use for 28 days resulted in significant  gain, reduction in platelet levels, decrease in WBCs, and increase in blood glucose compared to the normal. TSE caused no adverse effects on vital organs. No mortality was recorded.

As the physicochemical properties of the cytotoxic drug (payload) and linker may impact the conformational and colloidal stabilities of the conjugated monoclonal antibody (mAb), it is essential to characterize how the conjugation may affect the overall higher order structure and therefore the physical stability and integrity of the ADCs upon storage conditions. Here, the ADC monomer and aggregates generated upon thermal stress were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to SAXS with a particular focus on the fraction of dimers (3-10% depending on the storage conditions at 25 and 40 °C). In addition to average parameters such as radius of gyration, molecular , and maximal end-to-end distance, the structural information obtained from SAXS patterns were visualized as a low-resolution average envelope of both monomers and dimers (implementation of two methods: ab initio reconstruction and modeling Fab and Fc as rigid bodies with a flexible hinge). We showed that the monomer envelope of the ADC was similar to the corresponding (nonconjugated) parent monoclonal antibody (mAb). ADC dimers appeared more compact and less polydisperse than the dimers of mAb, which was also confirmed by atomic force microscopy. The generated envelopes of the mAb dimers suggest elongated structures with one or few inter-mAb contacts at the outermost region of Fab or Fc domains. The structural features of ADC dimers are independent of the tested pH buffering system (pH 5.0/ and pH 6.0/histidine with or without NaCl) and characterized by multiple, tighter contacts between the Fab and Fc domains and distortion of the monomer native shape. Results from the SAXS structural study show in the present case that conjugation has favored innermost inter-ADC contacts in the dimer, which differ from the inter-mAb ones. In general, it is likely that many parameters affect inter-ADC association, including the chemical nature of linkers and drugs, degree of conjugation, conjugation sites, etc. Making a qualitative difference between mAb and ADC dimers as a function of these parameters can help point to the presence of tight associations that must be abolished in protein drug formulations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890504>[Effect of methanol-ethyl  partitioned fractions from  on proliferation and apoptosis of human non-small cell lung cancer H1975 cells].</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of methanol-ethyl  partitioned fractions from  (MEDS) on the proliferation and apoptosis of human non-small cell lung cancer H1975 cells.The systemic solvent extraction method was used to preliminary separation of the effective fractions in the methanol extract of .

However, this effect has not been demonstrated in humans. In this study, we tested the effects of RS in 19 volunteers with normal  . A randomized, double-blinded and crossover design clinical trial was conducted. The study subjects were given either 40 g high amylose RS2 or energy-matched control starch with three identical diets per day throughout the study. The effect of RS was evaluated by monitoring  fat, glucose metabolism, gut hormones, gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and metabolites. The visceral and subcutaneous fat areas were significantly reduced following RS intake.  and early-phase insulin, C-peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion were increased, and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were decreased after the RS intervention. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, certain gut microbes were significantly decreased after RS supplementation, whereas the genus Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 showed an increase in abundance. Other potential signatures of the RS intervention included Akkermansia, Ruminococcus_2, Victivallis, and Comamonas. Moreover, the baseline abundance of the genera Streptococcus, Ruminococcus_torques_group, Eubacterium_hallii_group, and Eubacterium_eligens_group was significantly associated with the hormonal and metabolic effects of RS.

Cassava root chips (CRC) is rich in energy and fiber, and thus may serve as an alternative energy source in poultry diets, while the fiber in it will undergo microbial fermentation and improve the gut health of broilers. This study evaluated the effects of dietary inclusion of different levels of CRC on the growth performance and gut health parameters of broiler chickens. A total of 180 day-old chicks were allocated randomly to 5 dietary treatments, each with 6 replicate pens. The 5 dietary treatments were the corn-soybean meal-based diets with 0, 12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50% CRC inclusion in the 42-D feeding trial. Ileal histomorphology and cecal volatile fatty acid (VFA) were evaluated as indicators of gut health. Compared to the control group (0% CRC), broiler  was not different (P > 0.05) up to 25% CRC inclusion in the starter period (1 to 21 D) and up to 37.5% in the total study period (1 to 42 D). The average daily gain was significantly lower (P < 0.05) at 50% CRC inclusion in the starter period and for the total study period. Feed conversion ratio did not differ (P > 0.05) up to 37.5% CRC inclusion in the starter diet, and up to 50% CRC inclusion in the finisher diet. Villus height, crypt depth, their ratio, and villus surface area were not different among the treatments (P > 0.05). Total VFA and  production increased with the increasing dietary inclusion of CRC from 25 to 50%. In conclusion, CRC can be used to replace conventional energy feedstuff (like corn) up to 25 and 37.5% in starter and finisher diets, respectively. Use of CRC in diets may benefit broiler chickens' production by reducing feed costs and contribute to improving gut health.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960422>Solid-State Polymerization of Poly(Ethylene Furanoate) Biobased Polyester, III: Extended Study on Effect of Catalyst Type on Molecular  Increase.</a></h2><p>In this study, the synthesis of poly(ethylene furanoate) (PEF), catalyzed by five different catalysts-antimony  (III) (Sb Ac), zirconium (IV) isopropoxide isopropanal (Zr Is Ip), antimony (III) oxide (Sb Ox), zirconium (IV) 2,4-pentanedionate (Zr Pe) and germanium (IV) oxide (Ge Ox)-via an industrially common combination of melt polymerization and subsequent solid-state polymerization (SSP) is presented. In all reactions, proper amounts of 2,5-dimethylfuran-dicarboxylate (DMFD) and ethylene glycol (EG) in a molar ratio of DMFD/EG= 1/2 and 400 ppm of catalyst were used. Polyester samples were subjected to SSP procedure, under vacuum application, at different reaction times (1, 2, 3.5, and 5 h) and temperatures of 190, 200, and 205 °C. Carboxyl end-groups concentration (⁻COOH), intrinsic viscosity (IV), and thermal properties, via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), were measured for all resultant polymers to study the effect of the used catalysts on the molecular  increase of PEF during SSP process. As was expected, it was found that with increasing the SSP time and temperature, the intrinsic viscosity and the average molecular  of PEF steadily increased. In contrast, the number of carboxyl end-groups content showed the opposite trend as intrinsic viscosity, that is, gradually decreasing during SSP time and temperature increase. It is worthy to note that thanks to the SSP process an obvious and continuous enhancement in the thermal properties of the prepared PEF samples was attained, in which their melting temperatures () and degree of crystallinity () increase progressively with increasing of reaction time and temperature. To predict the time evolution of polymers IV, as well as the hydroxyl and carboxyl content of PEF polyesters during the SSP, a simple kinetic model was developed. From both the theoretical simulation results and the experimental measurements, it was demonstrated that surely the Zr Is Ip catalyst shows the best catalytic characteristics compared to all other used catalysts herein, that is, leading in reducing-in a spectacular way-the activation energy of the involved both transesterification and esterification reactions during SSP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055100>Fractionation of direct dyes using modified vapor grown carbon nanofibers and zirconia in cellulose  blend membranes.</a></h2><p>In the textile industry, membrane technology has been widely employed for the exclusion of direct dyes.

Ruminal pH was lower, and total volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration was higher for HCP or RPFA+.  proportion was higher, and propionate proportion was lower for HCP or RPFA+. As a result, the higher  to propionate ratio was observed. Ruminal ammonia N was higher for HCP, but was lower with RPFA supplementation. The higher digestibility of DM, OM, CP and NDF was observed. Blood glucose and insulin were unchanged, but albumin, total protein, GH and IGF-1 were higher. Similarly, the higher hepatic expression of GH, IGF-1, GHR, IGF-1R, PI3K, mTOR and P70S6K was observed for HCP or RPFA+. The results indicated that increasing dietary CP content or supplementation with RPFA promoted growth performance of calves by improving nutrient utilization and up-regulating hepatic expression of gene related to protein synthesis.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525980>Effect of the Ratio of Betamethasone to TNF-α siRNA Coencapsulated in Solid Lipid Nanoparticles on the Acute Proinflammatory Activity of the Nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>There is evidence that encapsulating glucocorticoids into nucleic acid-containing nanoparticles reduces the inflammatory toxicities of the nanoparticles. Herein, using betamethasone  (BA), a glucocorticoid, and a solid lipid nanoparticle formulation of siRNA, we confirmed that coencapsulating BA into the siRNA solid lipid nanoparticles significantly reduced the proinflammatory activity of the siRNA nanoparticles in a mouse model. Using TNF-α siRNA, we then showed that the BA and TNF-α siRNA coencapsulated into the solid lipid nanoparticles acted as a dual anti-inflammatory and synergistically reduced TNF-α release by mouse macrophages in culture following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, as compared to solid lipid nanoparticles encapsulated with TNF-α siRNA or BA alone. Importantly, upon studying the effect of the ratio of BA and TNF-α siRNA on the proinflammatory activity of the resultant nanoparticles, we identified that BA and TNF-α siRNA coencapsulated solid lipid nanoparticles prepared with a BA to TNF-α siRNA  ratio of 2:1 induced the lowest proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages in culture. This result was in comparison to nanoparticles prepared with BA to TNF-α siRNA ratios both higher and lower than 2:1 (i.e., 4:1, 1:1, and 0.5:1) and is likely due to differences in molecular interactions among the various components in the BA and TNF-α-siRNA coencapsulated solid lipid nanoparticles at these ratios. Encapsulating glucocorticoids into siRNA-nanoparticles represents a viable strategy to reduce the proinflammatory activity of the nanoparticles; however, the ratio of the glucocorticoid to siRNA in the nanoparticles requires optimization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31347350>Treatment with depot leuprolide  in girls with idiopathic precocious puberty: What is the best parameter to decide the initial dose?</a></h2><p>Doses of GnRH analogues used to treat idiopathic central precocious puberty(iCPP) may vary with clinician preference. Aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a monthly 3.75mg dose of leuprolide (LA) to suppress the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal(HPG) axis in girls with iCPP and to determine factors that may have an impact on the supressing dose.A total of 220 girls receiving LA for iCPP were included. LA is started at a dose of 3.75mg/28 days, and suppression is examined using GnRH test at the 3 month. Clinical signs and symptoms of puberty were also evaluated to determine whether pubertal suppression was achieved clinically. Dose of LA is increased to 7.5mg/28 days in those who have a peak LH≥2IU/L and in whom adequate suppression of pubertal signs was not achieved. ROC curves were used to determine thresholds for clinical and hormonal factors with an impact on the suppressing dose of LA.We analyzed whether thresholds differentiate two populations using LA either at a dose of 3.75mg or 7.5mg, with logistic regression analyses.Peak stimulated LH in 88.6% of the patients was <2IU/L under treatment with 3.75 mg. Best threshold values that differentiate the two doses were 36.2kg for (BW), 1.64 for BMI-SDS(p<0.001). Multiple logistic regressions showed BW, and BMI-SDS above thresholds indicated requirement of LA at a dose of 7.5mg/28 days(p<0.001).3.75 mg monthly injections of LA is an effective treatment in majority of girls with iCPP, however higher initial dose may be preferred in patients with a BW≥36kg or BMI-SDS≥1.6 for effective suppression of HPG axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798571>Detailed Mode of Action of Arabinan-Debranching α--Arabinofuranosidase GH51 from .</a></h2><p>The gene encoding an α--arabinofuranosidase (BvAF) GH51 from  FZB42 was cloned and expressed in . The corresponding open reading frame consists of 1,491 nucleotides which encode 496 amino acids with the molecular mass of 56.9 kDa. BvAF showed the highest activity against sugar beet (branched) arabinan in 50 mM sodium  buffer (pH 6.0) at 45°C. However, it could hardly hydrolyze debranched arabinan and arabinoxylans. The time-course hydrolyses of branched arabinan and arabinooligosaccharides (AOS) revealed that BvAF is a unique -hydrolase producing exclusively L-arabinose. BvAF could cleave α-(1,2)- and/or α-(1,3)--arabinofuranosidic linkages of the branched substrates to produce the debranched forms of arabinan and AOS. Although the excessive amount of BvAF could liberate -arabinose from linear AOS, it was extremely lower than that on branched AOS. In conclusion, BvAF is the arabinan-specific exo-acting α--arabinofuranosidase possessing high debranching activity towards α-(1,2)- and/or α-(1,3)-linked branches of arabinan, which can facilitate the successive degradation of arabinan by -α-(1,5)--arabinanase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31158419>Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate and H production by Rhodopseudomonas sp.

The accumulation of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB) was investigated culturing Rhodopseudomonas sp. S16-VOGS3 with three carbon substrates either as , butyrate or lactate and with two nitrogen sources either as ammonium or glutamate. The investigation was carried out under several stress conditions caused by single or double nutrient deficiency. The content of P3HB in cell dry  (CDW) was 21.8% with lactate; 24.6% with  and 27.6% with butyrate under sulfur deficient conditions. The P3HB content increased significantly culturing Rhodopseudomonas sp. S16-VOGS3 with butyrate following three phases of growth: phase-1, nutrient sufficient conditions; phase-2, nitrogen-deficiency and phase-3, sulfur-deficient conditions. Under this last phase, the highest P3HB content was achieved (34.4% of CDW). A combined production of P3HB and molecular H was obtained when Rhodopseudomonas sp.

Total polyphenols were measured in the crude (60% acetone), liquor extracts (saponified with 0.75% NaOH) and in their acidified ethyl  (EtOAc) partitioned fractions both by spectrophotometry involving Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. Irrespective of the extraction methods used, saponification of BSG yielded higher polyphenols than in the crude extracts. The EtOAc fractionations yielded the highest total phenolic content (TPC) ranging from 3.01 ± 0.19 to 4.71 ± 0.28 mg gallic acid equivalent per g of BSG dry . The corresponding total polyphenols quantified by LC-MS/MS ranged from 549.9 ± 41.5 to 2741.1 ± 5.2 µg/g of BSG dry . Microwave and ultrasound with the parameters and equipment used did not improve the total polyphenol yield when compared to the conventional maceration method. Furthermore, the spectrophotometric quantification of the liquors overestimated the TPC, while the LC-MS/MS quantification gave a closer representation of the total polyphenols in all the extracts. The total polyphenols were in the following order in the EtOAc fractions: BSG light > BSG Mix > BSG dark, and thus suggested BSG light as a sustainable, low cost source of natural antioxidants that may be tapped for applications in food and phytopharmaceutical industries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585328>A novel HPLC method for analysis of atosiban and its five related substances in atosiban  injection.</a></h2><p>Consulting the national pharmacopoeia, no official quality standard was found for estimation of related substances and assay of atosiban  injection, of which main active component is atosiban.

However, the traditional heterogeneous esterification of lignocellulose suffered from the drawbacks of low efficiency, additional reaction medium and heating. In the present study, an efficient method was developed to produce the functionalized sugarcane bagasse (SCB) by ball milling without any additional solvents and heating. The effects of pulverization time, rotation speed, the kind of linear chain anhydrides, the ratio of anhydrides to SCB, with or without pyridine catalyst and the dosage of catalyst were investigated on  percent gain () of SCB esters. The results indicated that the high efficiency of this mechanocatalystic esterification was probably due to the destroyed crystalline structure and the promoted penetration of the esterifying reagent onto SCB bulk caused by ball milling. The maximum  of SCB , propionate and butyrate reached 33.3%, 33.6% and 32.4%, respectively. The physicochemical structure of the esterified SCB was characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), solid state cross-polarized magic angle spinning C nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS C-NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The direct evidence of the esterification occurrence was provided with FT-IR and solid-state CP/MAS C-NMR. The thermal stability of SCB increased upon the mechanocatalytic esterification.

The I lambs received a total of 45,000 L larvae of T. colubriformis (5,000 infective larvae, three times per week for three weeks). Daily feed intake was assessed using the I lambs as a reference for their respective pairs on the U group (pair-fed). ,  condition score and faeces (stool) samples were obtained every 15 days for 75 days. In both treatments, faecal egg count (FEC), digesta passage rate, rumen fermentation parameters, protozoa count and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) were evaluated. The lambs presented moderate infection (FEC = 620). The retention time of the digesta in the rumen-reticulum segment was lower (P < 0.05) in I lambs. The I lambs presented no inappetence, however, lower concentrations of total SCFA and butyrate, while higher  concentration were observed in these lambs (P < 0.05).

Forty Arabi male lambs with average  of 18.90 ± 0.6 kg were randomly divided into five treatments with eight replications. The five experimental treatments consisted of control diet, and 50% and 100% replacement of bean residues with wheat straw or 25% and 50% replacement with maize silage in the control diet respectively. Lambs were slaughtered at the end of the experiment to evaluate carcass traits and meat characteristics. Dry matter intake, blood glucose, urea nitrogen, cholesterol and triglyceride concentration were not affected by the experimental treatments. Apparent digestibility of nutrients; total concentration of volatile fatty acids,  and butyrate; and total rumen protozoa population were linearly increased by increasing the levels of bean residues, as replacement with wheat straw (p < .05). Replacement of bean residues in control diets instead of wheat straw or maize silage caused a positive linear incremental trend for average daily gain and total  gain. There was no significant difference in daily gain, final  and feed conversion ratio among the treatments. Instead of wheat straw or maize silage, replacement bean residues linearly increased chewing, ruminating and eating activities per neutral detergent fibre intake (p < .05). Carcass traits and physicochemical characteristics of meat were not affected by the treatments. It is advisable to use bean residues in the diet of lambs as an alternative to the wheat straw or maize silage, because no adverse effects were observed on rumen fermentation, blood metabolites and performance; moreover, improvement in average daily gain, total  gain and digestibility of nutrients, and the fact that bean residue is less expensive than wheat straw and maize silage.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30984581>Effects of  leaf extract on lipopolysaccharide -induced neuroinflammation in rats: A behavioral and H NMR-based metabolomics study.</a></h2><p>This research revealed the biochemical outcomes of metabolic dysregulation in serum associated with physiological sickness behavior following lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in rats, and treatment with  (CN).

Possible effects regulating adaptive thermogenesis and energy waste are poorly known. Therefore, we aimed to study how physiological supplementation with HEP is able to affect microbiota, energy metabolism and adaptive thermogenic capacity, and to contribute to the healthier phenotype promoted by HEP supplementation, as previously shown. We also attempted to decipher some of the mechanisms involved in the HEP effects, including in vitro experiments.We used a model of metabolic malprogramming consisting of the progeny of rats with mild calorie restriction during pregnancy, both under control diet and an obesogenic (high-sucrose) diet, supplemented with HEP, combined with in vitro experiments in primary cultured brown and white adipocytes treated with the postbiotic .Our main findings suggest that chronic HEP supplementation induces markers of brown and white adipose tissue thermogenic capacity, accompanied by a decrease in energy efficiency, and prevention of  gain under an obesogenic diet. We also show that HEP promotes an increase in beneficial bacteria in the gut and peripheral levels of . Moreover, in vitro  can improve adipokine production, and increase thermogenic capacity and browning in brown and white adipocytes, respectively, which could be part of the protection mechanism against excess  gain observed in vivo.HEP and  stand out as prebiotic/postbiotic active compounds able to modulate both brown-adipocyte metabolism and browning and protect against obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275281>Propionate Ameliorates  Skin Infection by Attenuating Bacterial Growth.</a></h2><p> causes various diseases including skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, and sepsis. Antibiotic-resistant  such as methicillin-resistant  (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant  is a serious threat in healthcare-associated settings and in the communities. In this study, we investigated the effects of short-chain fatty acids, metabolites produced by commensal bacteria, on the growth of  both  and . Sodium propionate (NaP) most potently inhibited the growth of MRSA and multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. Of note, only NaP, but not sodium  (NaA) or sodium butyrate (NaB), ameliorated MRSA skin infection, significantly lowering bacterial load, excessive cytokine production, and the size and  of abscesses approximately by twofold. In addition, interestingly,  deficient of lipoteichoic acids (LTA) or wall teichoic acids (WTA), which are important in bacterial physiology and antimicrobial susceptibility, was more susceptible to NaP than the wild-type. Furthermore,  deficient of D-alanine motifs common in LTA and WTA was more susceptible to NaP, its growth being almost completely inhibited. Concordantly, MRSA treated with an inhibitor of D-alanylation on LTA and WTA was more susceptible to NaP, and co-treatment of NaP and a D-alanylation inhibitor further decreased the pathology of MRSA skin infection. Collectively, these results demonstrate that NaP ameliorates MRSA skin infection by attenuating the growth of , and suggest an alternative combination treatment strategy against  infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31359019>Eurotium cristatum, a potential probiotic fungus from Fuzhuan brick tea, alleviated obesity in mice by modulating gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>Obesity is one of the major public health problems worldwide, mainly resulting from unhealthy lifestyles and diet. Gut microbiota dysbiosis may lead to obese humans and animals. Modulating gut bacteria through probiotics or certain dietary supplements could normalize gut microbiota and subsequently alleviate obesity. The daily consumption of Fuzhuan brick tea (FBT) or its extracts has been observed to alleviate obesity in humans and experimental animals. In this study, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice, such as  gain and fat accumulation, was prevented by the consumption of Eurotium cristatum, the dominant fungus during the manufacturing and storage of FBT. The dysbiosis of gut microbiota in C57BL/6J mice was also partially normalized. E. cristatum was able to modulate both gut fungal and bacterial compositions, based on the analysis of the microbiota composition of mice fecal samples (n = 5). E. cristatum increased  and butyrate-producing bacteria in mouse gut. There was five times more butyrate in the fecal samples from mice fed with E. cristatum than that from untreated HFD mice. Our results suggest that E. cristatum may be used as a probiotic fungus to alleviate obesity and to modulate gut microbiota in humans beneficially.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382221>Growth, carcass characteristics, cut yields and meat quality of lambs finished with zilpaterol hydrochloride and steroid implant.</a></h2><p>Forty hairbreed male lambs were used to evaluate the effects of zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH, 0 and 0.15 mg/kg BW) and steroid implant (SI, without and with 52.5 mg trenbolone  and 7.5 mg 17β-estradiol) on feedlot performance, carcass characteristics, non-carcass components, wholesale cut yield, and meat quality.

Megestrol  (MA) is a synthetic progestin that is widely used to increase appetite and  in various clinical settings. MA has been indicated to be effective in improving quality of life in patients with cancers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MA in treating malnourished elderly haemodialysis patients.A randomized controlled study involving 46 hypoalbuminemia haemodialysis patients aged 70 years or older was conducted. The patients in MA-treated group (n = 23) took 160 mg of MA daily, while those in control group (n = 23) were enrolled without any intervention. Anthropometric parameters and laboratory results, including height, dry ,  mass index, and modified subjective global assessment score as well as serum albumin, triglyceride, total cholesterol, hsCRP, IL-1b and IL-6 concentrations were measured in all patients before and after the intervention. Health-related quality of life was also evaluated using the KDQOL-SF 1.3.In the MA-treated group, a total of 18 patients finished the therapy over a 3-month period. Appetite was reported as improved by 15 patients, and a statistically significant increase was observed in dry  (53.36 ± 6.15 vs. 54.24 ± 6.32, P < 0.01) and serum albumin concentration (29.05 ± 3.91 vs. 37.67 ± 4.88, P < 0.01) in the MA-treated group compared to those of the control group. The quality of life in both the physical domain (46.73 ± 18.17 vs. 63.37 ± 22.35, P < 0.01) and the mental domain (50.28 ± 20.36 vs. 68.02 ± 25.48, P < 0.01) was also improved in the same group. There was no significant change in the inflammatory marker concentrations after the intervention. No serious or unexpected adverse events were observed except that one patient who withdrew due to excessive fluid gain between haemodialysis sessions.Our data suggest that MA can be effective in improving nutritional status and quality of life by increasing appetite in elderly haemodialysis patients with acceptable side effects; however, MA might not ameliorate inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028066>A Simple and Accurate Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Method for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Busulfan in Plasma.</a></h2><p>Busulfan, frequently used as a conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, has a narrow therapeutic range and wide intra-and interpatient variabilities. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring of busulfan is necessary to ensure that the drug concentrations of patients are within a targeted therapeutic range. In this study, we developed a simple and accurate method for measuring busulfan concentrations using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).Separation and detection of busulfan was performed using T3 column equipped with LC-MS/MS. Busulfan was isolated from 50 μL human plasma after mixing with busulfanH (internal standard) solution, calibrator, and quality-control material. The sample was eluted and gradated with a mobile phase composed of ammonium , formic acid, and water or methanol. The busulfan concentration was quantified using a six-point standard curve. Busulfan and busulfanH were detected in positive-ion multiple-reaction-monitoring mode. According to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guideline, we verified the precision, linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), and carryover.Busulfan and busulfanH were detected at m/z 264.1>151.1 and 272.2>159.1. The total run time was 3 min. Both intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation were <3%. The calibration curve was linear at 25-5,000 ng/mL. The LOD and LOQ were 2.5 ng/mL and 25 ng/mL, respectively. The recoveries ranged from 92.0-104.8% and the carryover was-0.02%.Our method for busulfan reduces total run time and has excellent analytical performance. It will be a useful method for therapeutic drug monitoring of busulfan in clinical laboratories.© 2019 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840869>Chitin and chitosan production from shrimp shells using ammonium-based ionic liquids.</a></h2><p>Ammonium-based ionic liquids (ILs): diisopropylethylammonium  ([DIPEA][Ac]), diisopropylethylammonium propanoate ([DIPEA][P]) and dimethylbutylammonium  ([DMBA][Ac]) are used for the extraction of chitin from shrimp shells.

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of  on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and explored its underlying mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS  (250 mM, 400 µL) was given intraperitoneally 30 minutes after LPS (5 mg/kg) intratracheal injection. Lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected 6 hours after the challenge of LPS. The histopathology scores, wet-to-dry  ratios, protein content, and cytokine levels in BALF were assessed. RESULTS The  treatment resulted in improved lung pathological score, alleviated LPS-induced microvascular permeability, and suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore,  decreased the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs and BALF, consistent with the declined immune cell counting found in BALF.

Two dietary treatments (pelleted complete feed supplemented without (control diet; CON) or with 0.05% LPL on dry matter basis) were tested in these experiments. Feed and water were provided  to lambs. The results showed that average daily gain (ADG) tended to increase or was not affected by LPL supplementation. Compared with CON, the supplementation of LPL resulted in an increase in dry matter, crude protein and organic matter digestibilities, and a decrease in neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber digestibilities. Ruminal pH values did not change with LPL supplementation, but the concentrations of ammonia and total short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were increased. The molar proportion of major individual SCFAs and the ratio of  to propionate were not affected by LPL supplementation. While the activity of lipase was decreased with LPL supplementation, all other serum biochemical parameters did not change. Rumen bacterial community was altered by LPL supplementation with the relative abundance of fibrolytic bacteria in the total bacterial population, such as , decreased. In conclusion, LPL supplementation can alter feed digestion, but may not result in consistent positive responses in animal growth performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783143>Cultivable microbial community in 2-km-deep, 20-million-year-old subseafloor coalbeds through ~1000 days anaerobic bioreactor cultivation.</a></h2><p>Recent explorations of scientific ocean drilling have revealed the presence of microbial communities persisting in sediments down to ~2.5 km below the ocean floor. However, our knowledge of these microbial populations in the deep subseafloor sedimentary biosphere remains limited. Here, we present a cultivation experiment of 2-km-deep subseafloor microbial communities in 20-million-year-old lignite coalbeds using a continuous-flow bioreactor operating at 40 °C for 1029 days with lignite particles as the major energy source. Chemical monitoring of effluent samples via fluorescence emission-excitation matrices spectroscopy and stable isotope analyses traced the transformation of coalbed-derived organic matter in the dissolved phase. Hereby, the production of  and C-depleted methane together with the increase and transformation of high molecular  humics point to an active lignite-degrading methanogenic community present within the bioreactor. Electron microscopy revealed abundant microbial cells growing on the surface of lignite particles. Small subunit rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that diverse microorganisms grew in the bioreactor (e.g., phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, Tenericutes, Ignavibacteriae, and SBR1093).

Then, the  of the rats; brain Pb content; brain glucose levels; activities of hexokinase, fructose-6-phosphate kinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; expression of genes related to the insulin signaling pathway; as well as the gene and protein expression of glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 and GLUT-3 in the hippocampus were evaluated. The results showed that Pb content in the brain tissue of rats in the dose groups significantly increased, whereas the  gain, activities of glucose metabolism-related enzymes, and expression of the insulin signaling pathway-related genes significantly decreased compared to the corresponding values in the control group. In comparison with the control group, the brain glucose levels increased significantly in the low-dose group, but there were no significant differences with the middle- and high-dose groups. Furthermore, the mRNA of GLUT-1 in the three dose groups and the GLUT-3 in the middle- and high-dose groups rose markedly, while the GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 protein expression significantly increased in the middle- and high-dose groups and in the high-dose group, respectively. Taken together, the results showed that Pb exposure resulted in a lower  gain, higher brain Pb content and also affected brain glucose metabolism and the insulin signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies of the effect of gradients in scale-down reactors with complex media disclosed an accumulation of several carboxylic acids and a parallel decrease of growth and product accumulation. This study, therefore, addresses the impact of carboxylic acids, for example,  and l-lactate, on the cultivation of the cadaverine producing strain C. glutamicum DM1945Δact3:P -ldcC and their potential role in scale up related performance losses. A fluctuating power input in shake flask and stirred tank cultivations with mineral salt was applied to mimic discontinuous oxygen availability. Results demonstrate, whenever sufficient oxygen was available, C. glutamicum recovered from previously occurring stressful conditions like an oxygen limiting phase. Reassimilation of acids was detected simultaneously. In cultures, which were supplemented with either  or l-lactate, a rapid cometabolization of both acids in presence of glucose was observed, showing conversion rates of 7.8 and 3.8 mmol g  hr , respectively. Uptake of these acids was accompanied by increased oxygen consumption. Proteins related to oxidative stress response, glycogen synthesis, and the main carbon metabolism were found in altered concentrations under oscillatory cultivation conditions. (Proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD012760). Virtually no impact on growth or product formation was observed. We conclude that the reduced growth and product formation in scale-down cultivations when complex media was used is not caused by the accumulation of carboxylic acids.© 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31011009>The effect of adding ethanolic saffron petal extract (SPE) and vitamin E on growth performance, blood metabolites and antioxidant status in Baluchi male lambs.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effects of the administration of ethanolic saffron petal extract (SPE) and vitamin E on growth performance, blood metabolites and antioxidant status in Baluchi lambs.Thirty-two Baluchi male lambs (35.22±5.75 kg) were randomly divided into 4 groups.

In this context, flower extracts of  L.-a traditional medicinal plant-were investigated in the present work. The LC-MS/MS profiling of the extracts, obtained by fractionated extraction, led to the identification of 66 constituents, mostly flavonols (quercetin and sexangularetin glycosides with dominating isoquercitrin), pseudodepsides of quinic and shikimic acids (prevailing isomers of chlorogenic acid and cynarin), and flavanols (catechins and proanthocyanidins). Minor extract components of possible chemotaxonomic value were flavalignans (cinchonain I isomers) and phenylamides (spermidine derivatives). As assessed by HPLC-PDA and UV-spectrophotometric studies, the extracts were polyphenol-abundant, with the contents up to 597.6 mg/g dry  (dw), 333.9 mg/g dw, 382.0 mg/g dw, and 169.0 mg/g dw of total phenolics, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and caffeoylquinic acids, respectively. Their biological  effects were phenolic-dependent and the strongest for diethyl ether, ethyl , and -butanol fractions of the methanol-water (7 : 3, /) extract. The extracts showed significant, concentration-dependent ability to scavenge -relevant radical/oxidant agents (O , OH, HO, ONOO, NO, and HClO) with the strongest effects towards OH, ONOO, HClO, and O  (compared to ascorbic acid). Moreover, the extracts efficiently inhibited lipoxygenase and hyaluronidase (compared to indomethacin) but were inactive towards xanthine oxidase. At -relevant levels (1-5 g/mL), they also effectively protected human plasma components (proteins and lipids) against ONOO-induced oxidative damage (reduced the levels of 3-nitrotyrosine, lipid hydroperoxides, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) and normalised/enhanced the total nonenzymatic antioxidant capacity of plasma. In cytotoxicity tests, the extracts did not affect the viability of human PBMCs and might be regarded as safe.

We used a total of thirty-two Nellore steers (initial BW of 197 ± 15.3 kg), 12 of which were fitted with rumen cannulas. For 13 months, the animals were maintained in 12 paddocks and fed a concentrate of ground corn, soybean meals, mineral supplements, and urea (URS) or encapsulated nitrate (EN) containing 70 g of EN/100 kg of BW (corresponding to 47 g NO /100 kg BW). Encapsulated nitrate supplementation resulted in similar forage, supplement and total DMI values as URS ( > 0.05), but ENS tended to increase (+48 g/d;  = 0.055) average daily  gain. Daily reductions in methane emissions (-9.54 g or 18.5%) were observed with ENS when expressed as g of CH/kg of forage dry matter intake (fDMI) ( = 0.037). Lower concentrations of NH-N and a higher ruminal pH were observed in ENS groups 6 h after supplementation ( < 0.05).

It has been suggested that  loss may affect SCFA metabolism, but a systematic review of intervention studies is lacking. We aimed to systematically assess the effects of dietary, physical activity-based, and surgical -loss interventions among overweight [ mass index (BMI) 25-29.9 kg/m2)] or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) adults (≥18 y) on concentrations of , propionate, butyrate, and total SCFAs in blood, urine, or feces. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to April 30, 2018 for randomized and nonrandomized -loss trials among overweight or obese adults, in which the concentrations of individual and total SCFAs were assessed. A total of 9 studies consisting of 2 randomized parallel-arm trials, 4 crossover trials, and 3 nonrandomized clinical or surgical trials were included. In the majority of studies, changes in fecal SCFA concentrations were assessed, whereas changes in serum SCFAs were reported from 1 trial. Individual and total SCFA concentrations either remained unchanged or decreased significantly following  loss. Three of the dietary interventions that resulted in decreased SCFA concentrations were low (≤5% of energy) in total carbohydrates. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias. Decreases in SCFA concentrations may accompany  loss induced by bariatric surgery or dietary restriction among overweight or obese adults, particularly when carbohydrate intake is reduced. However, findings were inconsistent and based on studies with high to unclear risk of bias, and small sample sizes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of a G. lucidum aqueous extract (GL) when concurrently administered with Pb. Adult Wistar rats were administered oral doses of Pb (100 mg/kg) daily for 25 consecutive days. Of the Pb-treated rats, 3 groups received 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day GL, respectively; one group was given only 50 mg/kg/day 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA); and another group was given 400 mg/kg/day GL and 50 mg/kg/day DMSA. , Pb levels in organs, enzyme and lipid levels in serum, and antioxidant capability were evaluated.   were not significantly altered by GL. All doses of GL significantly reduced the amount of Pb in the liver (P < 0.01) and kidneys (P < 0.05), but not in the spleen. Doses of GL significantly reduced (P < 0.05) amounts of low-density lipoprotein, but not high-density lipoprotein or triglycerides, in serum. Pb-induced increases in amounts of serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated by GL. Also, a Pb-induced reduction in the amount of superoxide dismutase was significantly (P < 0.05) reversed, but the nitric oxide level was not significantly elevated. An increased malondialdehyde level, which had been induced by Pb, was significantly (P < 0.01) reversed. In conclusion, GL protects against some of the deleterious effects of Pb ingestion, possibly through antioxidant and other mechanisms. DMSA did not enhance the beneficial effects of GL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30782289>Bioactivity evaluation and HPLC UV-VIS based quantification of antioxidant secondary metabolites from extract and fractions of Bistorta amplexicaulis rhizome.</a></h2><p>Bistorta amplexicaulis is a popular medicinal plant and reported as rich source of antioxidant compounds. The present study was designed for antioxidant and anticancer potential of polarity based fractions of B. amplexicaulis and its correlation to the secondary metabolites quantified by HPLC-UV/VIS.Crude extract was prepared by maceration method and polarity based fractions were prepared by solvent-solvent extraction. Antioxidant and anticancer potential was investigated by using various physiological and non-physiological assays while secondary metabolites rutin, naringin and quercetin present in extract and fractions were quantified by using HPLC- UV/VIS. All extracts showed Antioxidant potential but highest activity was obtained with ethyl  fraction (DPPH IC50 5.76±0.03 µg/ml, ABTS IC50 0.74±0.1 µg/ml, Total Antioxidant Assay 72.55±0.098 Ascorbic acid equivalents, Super oxide radical scavenging assay IC506.86±0.1909 µg/ml, Hydroxyl radical scavenging assay IC50 0.96±0.1690 µg/ml). The cytotoxicity of fractions against HepG2 cell lines showed lowest ell viability in n-hexane fraction (11%). The results revealed that ethyl  fraction of B. amplexicaulis can be a potential source of novel antioxidant compounds while n hexane fraction could provide anticancer compounds.

Access to raw material suitable for heparin extraction is critical for creating a viable business opportunity. In Saudi Arabia, large amounts of raw material with potential for heparin extraction are wasted.To extract heparin and low-molecular- heparin (LMWH) from the camel lung, and measure its potency and activity.Heparin preparation included three steps: extraction, electrophoretic identification, and activity measurement. Fresh lung tissue (100 g) was minced and homogenized in a blender. Crude heparin extracts were prepared using Charles's or Volpi's method with slight modifications. Heparin was purified by electrophoresis using high-purity agarose gels in barium  buffer. The heparin activity of purified samples was assayed spectrophotometrically using commercial heparin kits.Charles's and Volpi's extraction methods were simple and easy to establish. The yield was 90 mg crude heparin per 100 g of camel lung tissue following Volpi's extraction protocol, whereas Charles's method did not yield any heparin. The separation of heparin and LMWH by gel electrophoresis resulted in sharp and clear product bands using material prepared according to Volpi's method. The heparin preparation had an anti-factor Xa activity of 37 IU/mg, indicating weak potency.Preparation of active heparin from camel lung tissue is a technology applicable in manufacturing. Further method development is needed to increase heparin purity and potency.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142345>Effect of Acacia hydaspica R. Parker extract on lipid peroxidation, antioxidant status, liver function test and histopathology in doxorubicin treated rats.</a></h2><p>Doxorubicin (DOX) is an anthracycline agent mostly prescribed for various cancers. However, its treatment is contiguous with toxic effects. Acacia hydaspica prevented drug-induced hepatic-toxicity in animals with anti-oxidative mechanisms. We intended to study the efficacy of A. hydaspica ethyl  extract (AHE) for inhibiting DOX- induced liver damage.Normal control group received saline; Drug control group received 3 mg/kg b.w. dose of DOX for 6 weeks (single dose/week, intraperitoneal injection) to study the effect of chronic DOX treatment. In co-treatment groups, 200 and 400 mg/kg b.w AHE was given orally for 6 weeks in concomitant with DOX (3 mg/kg b.w, i.p. injection per week). The standard drug group received silyamrin 100 mg/kg b.w (2 doses/week: 12 doses/6 weeks) in conjunction with DOX (single dose/week). Lipid profile, liver function tests (LFTs), antioxidant enzymes, oxidative stress enzymes and morphological alterations were studied to evaluate the hepatoprotective potential of AHE.DOX treatment inhibits  gain and upturn liver index. DOX considerably upset serum cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL concentration. On the contrary, it reduced serum HDL amount. DOX induced marked depreciation in serum LFTs, diminish hepatic antioxidant enzymes; however, raised tissue oxidative stress markers accompanied by morphological damages. Co-treatment with AHE dose dependently adjusted DOX-prompted fluctuations in lipid profile, AST, ALP, ALT, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin concentrations and hepatic . Likewise, AHE usage enhanced total protein and hepatic tissue antioxidant enzyme quantities whereas declined oxidative stress markers in hepatic tissue. Correspondingly histopathological examinations aid the biochemical results. The influence of AHE 400 mg/kg b.w dose is analogous to silymarin.Acacia hydaspica possibly serve as adjuvant therapy that hampers DOX inveigled liver damage due to the underlying antioxidant mechanism of secondary metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535460>Wheat Protein Hydrolysate Fortified With l-Arginine Enhances Satiation Induced by the Capsaicinoid Nonivamide in Moderately Overweight Male Subjects.</a></h2><p>Increasing the intake of satiety-enhancing food compounds represents a promising strategy for maintaining a healthy . Recently, satiating effects for the capsaicinoid nonivamide have been demonstrated. As various proteins and amino acids have also been demonstrated to decrease energy intake, oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT)-based bolus interventions of 75 g glucose + 0.15 mg nonivamide (NV control) are tested with/without combination of a wheat protein hydrolysate (WPH: 2 g) and/or l-arginine (ARG: 3.2 g) for their satiating effects in 27 moderately overweight male subjects.Compared to NV control intervention, ARG and WPH + ARG treatment both reduce (p < 0.01) total calorie intake from a standardized breakfast by -5.9 ± 4.15% and -6.07 ± 4.38%, respectively. For the WPH + ARG intervention, increased mean plasma serotonin concentrations (AUC: 350 ± 218), quantitated by ELISA, and delayed gastric emptying, assessed by  C-Na- breath test (-2.10 ± 0.51%, p < 0.05), are demonstrated compared to NV control. Correlation analysis between plasma serotonin and gastric emptying reveals a significant association after WPH ± ARG intervention (r = -0.396, p = 0.045).Combination of WPH and ARG enhances the satiating effect of nonivamide, providing opportunities to optimize satiating food formulations by low amounts of the individual food constituents.© 2019 The Authors.

Obesity is one of the major risk factors of hypertension. The novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor CG200745 was originally developed to treat various cancers. Previous studies showed that CG200745 attenuated hypertension through inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in deoxycorticosterone -induced hypertensive rat. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of CG200745 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hypertension. Nine-week old C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet (ND) or HFD for 17 weeks. Each group of mice was treated with vehicle or CG200745 by intraperitoneal injection for 9 days. HFD group showed higher , blood pressure (BP), HDAC activities, angiotensinogen and renin expressions in kidney, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) expression in the lung, serum angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration, and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation in mesenteric artery compared with ND group. CG200745 lowered BP, HDAC activity, renin and angiotensinogen in the kidney, ACE in the lung, serum Ang II level, and phosphorylation of MLC in HFD group. In conclusion, CG200745 ameliorated HFD-induced hypertension through inhibition of HDAC/Ang II/vascular contraction axis. Our results offer CG200745 as a novel therapeutic option for HFD-induced hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30792016>Synbiotic-driven improvement of metabolic disturbances is associated with changes in the gut microbiome in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota is an important influencing factor of metabolic health. Although dietary interventions with probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics can be effective means to regulate obesity and associated comorbidities, the underlying shifts in gut microbial communities, especially at the functional level, have not been characterized in great details. In this study, we sought to investigate the effects of synbiotics on the regulation of gut microbiota and the alleviation of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic disorders in mice.Specific pathogen-free (SPF) male C57BL/6J mice were fed diets with either 10% (normal diet, ND) or 60% (high-fat diet, HFD) of total calories from fat (lard). Dietary interventions in the HFD-fed mice included (i) probiotic (Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei DSM 46331), (ii) prebiotic (oat β-glucan), and (iii) synbiotic (a mixture of i and ii) treatments for 12 weeks. Besides detailed characterization of host metabolic parameters, a multi-omics approach was used to systematically profile the microbial signatures at both the phylogenetic and functional levels using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metaproteomics and targeted metabolomics analysis.The synbiotic intervention significantly reduced  gain and alleviated features of metabolic complications. At the phylogenetic level, the synbiotic treatment significantly reversed HFD-induced changes in microbial populations, both in terms of richness and the relative abundance of specific taxa. Potentially important species such as Faecalibaculum rodentium and Alistipes putredinis that might mediate the beneficial effects of the synbiotic were identified. At the functional level, short-chain fatty acid and bile acid profiles revealed that all dietary interventions significantly restored cecal levels of , propionate, and butyrate, while the synbiotic treatment reduced the bile acid pools most efficiently. Metaproteomics revealed that the effects of the synbiotic intervention might be mediated through metabolic pathways involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolisms.Our results suggested that dietary intervention using the novel synbiotic can alleviate HFD-induced  gain and restore gut microbial ecosystem homeostasis phylogenetically and functionally.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This disease causes loss of tooth hard tissue and subsequent inflammation and loss of the dental pulp. In this study, it was aimed to develop and characterize boron (B) modified bioactive glass nanoparticles (BG-NPs) containing cellulose /oxidized pullulan/gelatin (CA/ox-PULL/GEL) three dimensional scaffolds with tubular morphology for dentin regeneration. 3D nanobiocomposite structures were prepared by thermally induced phase separation and porogen leaching methods and characterized by in vitro degradation analysis, water absorption (WA) capacity measurement, SEM, in vitro biomineralization analysis, porosity measurement and mechanical tests. Scaffolds lost about (30-40)% of their  during one month and WA capacity decreased with increase in immersion time in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) during one month. According to SEM, aligned and tubular structures were formed with mean diameter of about 11 μm, and BG-NPS were distributed evenly in all parts of the scaffolds. Scaffolds (without BG-NPs) possessed the highest porosity percentage. Addition of 10% BG-NPs improved the mechanical properties of scaffolds. Scaffolds surfaces were fully covered by calcium phosphate (Ca-P) deposits after conditioning in simulated  fluid for 14 days with higher quantity of deposition in groups with inclusion of B-BG-NPs. Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) were isolated from third molar teeth and used in cell culture studies. In all groups, cells adhered well 1 day after culture. Group B14-10 showed a slight increase of proliferation than group (without BG-NPs) after 7 days of incubation. Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and intracellular calcium amounts increased significantly 14 days after incubation with highest values in B14-10 and B14-20 groups. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CSLM) analysis, showed that cells on B14-10 and B21-10 scaffold groups, spread more 14 days after culture, and they also possessed extended processes specific to odontoblasts. Alizarin Red quantification showed that the highest calcium deposition was observed on B14-10 scaffolds. Immunohistochemical and Von Kossa stainings showed that scaffolds positively affected the odontoblastic differentiation of the hDPSCs. In this work, results showed that boron modified BG-NPs (B-BG-NPs) incorporated dentin-like constructs bring a new approach for dental tissue engineering applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Giganteus by a new two-step chemical oxidation, that involves bleach treatment and ammonium persulfate oxidation, followed by ultrasonication. The resulting MxG-CNF-COHs have ca. 1200 mmol/kg carboxylic acid surface groups, an aspect ratio of 230 (height of ca. 3.8 ± 0.8 nm and length of ca. 880 ± 300 nm) and 70% crystallinity. Interestingly, these MxG-CNF-COHs exhibit better thermal stability (as measured by thermal gravimetric analysis) and better dispersibility in DMF than corresponding cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) obtained from same biosource (MxG-CNC-COHs) via acid hydrolysis. Poly(vinyl ):MxG-CNF-COH composites show an increase in storage modulus (above T) with increasing filler content. Importantly, the mechanical properties of the poly(vinyl ):nanocellulose composites showed that the MxG-CNF-COHs exhibit significantly better reinforcement than the MxG-CNC-COH at the same  percent filler content.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The groups received diets at different DCAD levels, either a control diet (22.81 mEq/100 g DM, DCAD-23) or a DCAD-39 diet (39.08 mEq/100 g DM, DCAD-39). After parturition, DMI and water intake were recorded daily. Ruminal fluid and urine were collected, and nutrient digestibility measurements were carried out at 8th weeks postpartum (PP-8). Blood samples were collected at PP-4 and PP-8 to measure plasma leptin.Dry matter intake/ (DMI/BW) at PP-8 of the animals fed the DCAD-39 diet was significantly higher than those fed with DCAD-23 diet (P<0.05). Animals fed with DCAD-39 consumed more water than those fed DCAD-23 over 24 h, particularly at night (P<0.05). Ruminal pH,  concentration, and urinary allantoin excretion increased with the DCAD-39 diet, whereas ruminal butyrate concentration was lower with the DCAD-39 diet. On the other hand, other ruminal parameters, such as total volatile fatty acid concentration, propionate molar proportion and /propionate average ratio, were not affected by increased DCAD supplementation. Apparent digestibility was improved by increased DCAD supplementation. Plasma leptin concentration was higher with DCAD supplementation.When feeding goats with DCAD-39 under tropical conditions, an increase in DMI was associated with improved apparent digestibility of nutrients, ruminal fermentation and microbial protein synthesis. An increase in plasma leptin concentration could not explain the effect of high DCAD on DMI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31356954>Utilization of lignin fractions in UV resistant lignin-PLA biocomposites via lignin-lactide grafting.</a></h2><p>Lignin was fractionated with several organic solvents and fractions were utilized for UV resistant lignin-PLA composites. First, soda lignin (SL) was sequentially fractionated into six fractions: ethyl  (F1), 2-butanone (F2), methanol (F3), acetone (F4), dioxane/water (F5), and an insoluble fraction (INS). Molecular  of the fractions increased from F1 to F5 and phenolic hydroxyl contents decreased with increasing molecular  of fractions. Five lignin fractions (SL, F1, F3, F5, and INS) were grafted with l-lactide to produce lignin-grafted poly-l-lactide (PLLA) copolymers. Conversion ratio of l-lactide to PLLA chains increased from 88.3% for F5-PLLA copolymer to 91.2% for F1-PLLA copolymer as the content of hydroxyl groups in the fraction increased, while the molecular  of the copolymers showed the reverse tendency. Each copolymer was mixed with PLA 2002D, and mechanical and optical properties of the composites were investigated. Composites of F1, F3, and F5 showed a tensile strength around 65 MPa, which is similar to that of neat PLA. The elastic modulus increased from 2197.7 for F1 to 2503.4 MPa for F5. According to the investigation of UV-VIS transmittance of the composite films, composites of F3 and F5 showed better UV blocking ability than the other composites, and this UV blocking ability increased with increasing concentration of lignin copolymer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Cablin patchouli herb (CPH), Atractylodes rhizome (AR), Amur Cork-tree (AC) and Cypsum were mixed with the  ratios of 1:1:1:0.5 and 1:1:1:1 to make up TCMC1 and TCMC2, respectively. Both TCMC were added at level of 25 g/kg of substrate dry matter.  gas production was recorded and methane concentration was determined at 12 and 24 h of incubation. After 24 h, the incubation was terminated and the inoculants were measured for pH, ammonia nitrogen, volatile fatty acids (VFA). Total deoxyribonucleic acid of ruminal microbes was extracted from the inocula, and populations were determined by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Populations of total rumen methanogens, protozoa, total fungi, ,  and  were expressed as a proportion of total rumen bacterial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid. Compared with the control, the 2 TCMC decreased ( ≤ 0.05) total VFA concentration,  molar proportion,  to propionate ratio, gas and methane productions at 12 and 24 h, hydrogen (H) produced and consumed, and methanogens and total fungi populations, while the 2 TCMC increased ( ≤ 0.05) propionate molar proportion. Traditional Chinese medicine compound 1 also decreased ( ≤ 0.05)  population. From the present study, it is inferred that there is an effect of the TCMC in suppressing methanogenesis, probably mediated via indirect mode by channeling H utilized for methanogenesis to synthesis of propionate and direct action against the rumen microbes involved in methane formation. In addition, the relative methane reduction potential (RMRP) of TCMC2 was superior to that of TCMC1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901677>Genistein protects against DSS-induced colitis by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome via TGR5-cAMP signaling.</a></h2><p>NLRP3 inflammasome has been reported to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease including colitis due to its potential ability to induce IL-1β secretion. Emerging studies have demonstrated that Genistein, a major isoflavone, has potential anti-inflammatory effects in murine model colitis. However, its anti-inflammatory mechanism remains unclear. The effects of Genistein in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis via targeting NLRP3 inflammasome was investigated in this study. Also, the mechanisms of protective action of Genistein in DSS-induced colitis may relate to TGR5 signaling. Genistein treatment not only remarkably attenuated loss of  and shortening of colon length but also significantly reduced inflammatory cells infiltration and pro-inflammatory mediator production in serum and colon. Moreover, Genistein treatment down-regulated production of caspase-1 and IL-1β and increased intracellular cAMP level, which were similar to the treatment for INT-777, a semi-synthetic TGR5 agonist, in phorbol myristate  (PMA)-differentiated monocytic THP-1 cells and U937 cells. These protective effects of Genistein might be attributed by ubiquination of NLRP3 which was induced due to interaction of cAMP with NLRP3. Furthermore, the effects of Genistein on NLRP3 inflammasome disappeared in TGR5-silenced U937 cells. In conclusion, our study unveils that Genistein was able to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome via TGR5-cAMP signaling in macrophages. It therefore might be a potential effective drug for inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2019.

We likewise saw treating mice with 1.0 mg of DMPA reduced vaginal CCAM expression and increased genital pathogen susceptibility. Herein, we used dose-response studies to delimit DMPA doses and serum MPA levels in mice associated with impaired genital mucosal barrier function and enhanced susceptibility to low-dose herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection.We compared genital CCAM expression, genital mucosal permeability, and susceptibility to genital inoculation with 10 plaque-forming units of HSV-2 among mice in estrus vs. after treatment with 0.01 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, or 1.0 mg of DMPA.Compared to mice in estrus, DMPA treatment in a dose-dependent fashion significantly reduced desmoglein 1α (Dsg1a) and desmocollin-1 (Dsc1) gene expression, reduced DSG1 protein levels, and increased genital mucosal permeability to a low molecular  molecule. While no mice infected with HSV-2 in estrus died, we respectively saw 50% and 100% mortality in mice administered 0.1 mg or 0.3 mg of DMPA. At time of infection, mean serum MPA levels in mice administered the 0.1 mg or 0.3 mg doses were 3.8 nM and 13.0 nM respectively (values comparable to trough and peak MPA serum levels in women using DMPA).Mice with pharmacologically relevant serum MPA concentrations display significant changes in genital CCAM expression, genital mucosal barrier function, and HSV-2 susceptibility.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty-four Holstein calves (2 d old) in hutches were used in a 12-wk randomized complete block design study. Calves were blocked by birth date and sex. Treatments were (1) control (CON) with no supplement and (2) 50 g/d of CWS. Preweaning CWS was fed with milk and postweaning CWS was top-dressed on starter pellets. Calves were fed 2.83 L of pasteurized milk 2×/d during wk 1 to 5, 1×/d in wk 6, and weaned at d 42. Calves had ad libitum access to starter pellets and water. Individual intakes of milk and starter pellets were measured daily. Fecal scores (0 = firm, 3 = watery) and respiratory scores (healthy ≤3, sick ≥5), calculated from the sum of scores for rectal temperature, cough, ocular, and nasal discharge, were recorded daily.   (BW), frame growth, and jugular blood samples were taken once every week at 3 h after the morning feeding. Fecal grab samples were collected in wk 12 for analysis of apparent total-tract digestibility. Data were analyzed using MIXED procedures of SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with repeated . Total dry matter intake was greater in calves fed CWS compared with CON. Calves fed CWS tended to have greater BW during the postweaning period. Gain:feed, average daily gains, withers heights, and concentrations of plasma urea nitrogen were not different. Concentrations of plasma β-hydroxybutyrate were greater in calves fed CWS compared with CON. Serum glucose concentrations were greater in calves fed CON during the preweaning stage, but similar concentrations were found between treatments during the postweaning stage. Rumen pH, ammonia-N, and total volatile fatty acids were similar between treatments. The :propionate ratio was greater in calves fed CWS. The apparent total-tract digestion of nutrients was similar; however, CON tended to have greater digestion of neutral detergent fiber. Fecal scores were not different, but a treatment by week interaction was observed. Supplementing CWS improved starter intake, postweaning BW, β-hydroxybutyrate, fecal scores, and maintained frame growth.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we describe the synthesis, physicochemical properties, and ROS-scavenging activities of one such derivative-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated manganese protoporphyrin (PEG-MnPP). Carboxyl groups of the protoporphyrin ring at the C6 and C7 positions were first conjugated with ethylenediamine to introduce amino groups into the protoporphyrin structure. The amino groups were then reacted with succinimidyl PEG, with an average molecular  of 2000, to obtain pegylated protoporphyrin (PEG-PP). Manganese was chelated to the protoporphyrin ring by incubating PEG-PP and manganese  in methanol. Dynamic light scattering and fluorescent spectrometry analyses revealed that PEG-MnPP self-assembled into nanoparticles in aqueous media with an apparent diameter of 70 nm. PEG-MnPP effectively eliminated hydrogen peroxide from cell culture media and protected cultured mammalian cells from toxic insults induced by hydrogen peroxide exposure or by 6-hydroxydopamine treatment.

Blood samples were obtained from 181 Wagyu-crossbred steers between 300-400 days before slaughter when carcass data was collected. H NMR spectroscopy identified 35 metabolites with 7 positively associated with marbling (3-hydroxybutyrate, propionate, , creatine, histidine, valine, and isoleucine; P ≤ 0.05). Subcutaneous rump fat thickness was positively associated with glucose, leucine and lipids (P ≤ 0.05) and negatively associated with anserine and arabinose (P ≤ 0.05). Carcass  and growth rate were negatively associated with 3-hydroxybutyrate (P < 0.05), and growth rate was negatively associated with creatine (P < 0.05) and positively associated with aspartate (P < 0.05). Glucose and arginine showed a significant interaction between marbling and number of days animals consumed a high-starch diet (P < 0.05). Sire was the single variable with the largest effect on the relative concentration of metabolites and carcass and production traits. Blood metabolomics helps understand fat and muscle metabolism, and is associated with genotype, and carcass and production traits in cattle offering potential biomarkers suitable to select animals for management and genetic improvement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302257>Co-production of 1,3 propanediol and long-chain alkyl esters from crude glycerol.</a></h2><p>Crude glycerol is an excellent carbon source for bacterial production systems. Bacterial fermentation often generates by-products that can offer an additional carbon pool to improve the product profile for optimal valorization. In this study, the properties of two phylogenetically distinct bacteria, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 and Clostridium butyricum, were coupled in a one-pot batch process to co-produce 1,3 propanediol (PDO) and long-chain alkyl esters (wax esters, WEs) from crude glycerol. In the process, A. baylyi deoxidized the growth medium allowing glycerol fermentation and PDO production by C. butyricum. Reaeration of the co-cultivations enabled A. baylyi to metabolize the fermentation by-products,  and butyrate, and synthesize intracellular WEs. To improve PDO production and A. baylyi growth, carbon and macronutrients in the growth medium were screened and optimized using Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken models. The validation experiment revealed a good correlation between the observed and predicted values. The salting-out method recovered 89.5% PDO from the fermentation broth and in vacuo extraction resulted in a PDO content of 5.3 g L. Nuclear magnetic resonance revealed a WE content and yield of 34.4 ± 1.4 mg L and 34.2 ± 3.2 mg WE g dry cell , respectively. A molar yield of 0.65 mol PDO mol and 0.62 μmol WE mol crude glycerol was achieved with the synthetic consortium. This work emphasizes the strength of response surface methodology in improving production processes from the mutualistic association of divergent bacterial species in consortium. The co-production of PDO and WEs from crude glycerol is demonstrated for the first time in this study.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 81 rabbits were allocated into free-range areas and divided into three groups (nine replicates per group): in the first group (face to face, F2F), the rabbits of each replicate could see each other. In the second group (blind) each replicate was isolated from the others; in the third group (mirrors), the replicates were divided as for the Blind group but two mirrors were placed in a corner of the perimeter. The blind group rabbits showed the lowest final  ( < 0.05), while rabbits from the mirrors groups showed the best FCR and net dressing out values. The blind group showed the highest production of total short chain fatty acids,  ( < 0.05) and propionate ( < 0.01). The F2F rabbits showed higher levels of creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase and lower values of blood glucose than those of the other groups, due to the higher locomotion activity. The use of mirrors can improve rabbit's growth performance and carcass traits by lowering the rabbit's locomotion activity in comparison to the other tested systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847794>A Capillary Electrophoresis UV Detection-Based Method for Global Genomic DNA Methylation Assessment in Human Whole Blood.</a></h2><p>Quantitative analysis of DNA methylation patterns is of special importance in several developmental and pathological situations.

The present study was focused on finding in-vitro and in-vivo anti-arthritic potential of P. braunii roots. In vitro protein denaturation, membrane stabilization and anti-trypsinase assays were carried out to demonstrate anti-arthritic activity of the extracts. Furthermore, the extracts exerting promising in vitro anti-arthritic potential were tested orally at 150, 300 and 600mg/kg/day against formaldehyde induced arthritis in Wistar rats. The methanolic, aqueous and ethyl  extracts of the plant revealed noteworthy in vitro anti-arthritic activities while mitigating formaldehyde induced paw edema in dose dependent manner. Methanolic and aqueous extracts showed the highest inhibition (p<0.05) of paw edema, arthritic indices, reduced elevated level of platelets and leukocytes while increasing hemoglobin and  of arthritic rats. Anti-arthritic activity of the plant extracts may be due to inhibition of protein denaturation and lysosomal membrane stabilization.

Some ionic liquids have been postulated as alternatives to glycerol, one of the best starch plasticizers, due to their great capacity to form hydrogen bonds with starch and hence great ability of preventing starch retrogradation and increasing film stability. In this work, [emim][Ac]-plasticized starch films were prepared from potato, corn and wheat starch. The effect of starch molecular structure in terms of granular composition (amylose and phosphate monoester contents) and molecular  (M) on film properties was evaluated. Potato starch films were the most amorphous because of the higher M and phosphate monoester content of potato starch, both contributing to a lower rearrangement of the starch chains making the crystallization process difficult. In contrast, corn and wheat starches lead to more crystalline films because of their lower M, which may imply higher mobility and crystal growth rate, and lower phosphate monoester content. This more crystalline structure could be the responsible of their better mechanical properties. [emim][Ac] can be considered suitable for manufacturing starch films showing corn and wheat starch films similar properties to synthetic low-density polyethylene, but involving a simple and environmentally-friendly process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We assessed the feasibility of single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy in a large barrel-shaped uterus after gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa).We retrospectively reviewed 39 patients with a large barrel-shaped uterus who were treated with GnRHa (leuprolide ) before single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy. During the same period, 134 patients without GnRHa pretreatment were included as control subjects.Patients with GnRHa treatment had an average increase in hemoglobin of 3.0 mg/dL and a decrease in uterine  of 330.9 g (40.1%). Ancillary ports were required in 2 patients in the treatment group and none in the control group. There were no differences in uterine , operative time, and estimated blood loss in the 2 groups of patients. The estimated average operative time was shortened by 34 min after GnRHa treatment. However, bladder and ureter injuries were marginally higher (10.3% versus 2.2%) and days of hospital stay (3.7 versus 3.1) were significantly longer in the treatment group compared with controls. Complication rates were correlated with previous operative history, pelvic adhesion, and larger uterine  but not with GnRHa treatment and operative sequence.GnRHa pretreatment in patients with a large barrel-shaped uterus during SPH is feasible with shortened operative time. However, the higher complication rates in these patients suggest that a -reduced barrel-shaped uterus that is achieved with GnRHa treatment could still be difficult and should be handled in cautious.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329991>Effect of dietary graded resistant potato starch levels on growth performance, plasma cytokines concentration, and intestinal health in meat ducks.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary graded raw potato starch (RPS) levels on growth performance, plasma cytokines concentration, ileal barrier function, and cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentration in meat ducks from 1 to 35 D of age. This study included 2 experiments. In experiment (Exp.) 1, sixteen 35-day-old meat ducks were used to evaluate the AME of RPS by orogastric administration. Results showed the AME value of RPS on ducks is 2.76 kcal/g. In Exp. 2, a total of 600 one-day-old ducklings were randomly assigned to 5 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic dietary treatments that included 0 (control), 6, 12, 18, and 24% RPS, respectively. Samples were collected at both of 14 and 35 D. Neither growth performance nor ileal parameters (length, , and pH) at both of 14 and 35 D was affected by dietary RPS. However, the mucosal thickness (14 D), villus height (except for 18% RPS at 14 D), and the villus height: crypt depth ratio (14 and 35 D) of the ileum were increased in the 12 and 18% RPS diets when compared to 0% RPS diet. Meanwhile, proinflammatory factors such as plasma interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 (14 D) reduced in 12% RPS diet and tumor necrosis factor α decreased in 12% (except for 14 D) and 18% RPS groups. When compared with the control group, diets with 18% RPS significantly increased mucin 2 gene expression at 14 D, and 12% RPS elevated the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins including Zonula occludens-1 and Claudin 1 (except for 14 D) in the ileal mucosa of birds. Furthermore, ducks fed 12% RPS diet had higher concentrations of , propionate, and butyrate in cecal digesta than other groups. These findings indicated that diets with 12 and/or 18% RPS increased the cecal SCFA concentration, which subsequently enhanced the barrier function and improved intestinal health in the ileum for 14 and 35-day-old meat ducks.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31019626>Prevalence of Documented Excessive  Gain Among Adolescent Girls and Young Women Using Depot Medroxyprogesterone .</a></h2><p>Depot medroxyprogesterone  (DMPA) is an accessible contraception with high efficacy among adolescents.

Adult female C57BL/6 mice had free access to AIN-93G purified rodent diet amended with Pb as a soluble salt, Pb , or in a soil matrix (NIST SRM 2710a). In these studies, the basal diet contained P at a nutritionally sufficient level (0.3% w/w) and the modified diets contained P at a lower (0.15%) or a higher (1.2%) level. For either dietary Pb source (Pb  or NIST SRM 2710a), low dietary P level markedly increased accumulation of Pb in bone, blood, and kidney. Tissue Pb levels in mice fed a high P in diet were not different from mice fed the basal P diet. Dietary P and Pb interacted to affect  change and feed efficiency in mice. The relative contribution of different Pb species in diet and feces was also affected by dietary P level. Differences in Pb species between diet and feces indicated that transformation of Pb species can occur during gastrointestinal tract transit. These interactions between Pb and P that alter Pb speciation may be important determinants of the bioavailability of Pb ingested in soil.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301358>Engineering Corynebacterium glutamicum for high-titer biosynthesis of hyaluronic acid.</a></h2><p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a member of the glycosaminoglycan family and has been widely used in the clinical, medical, cosmetic and food industries. In this study, we constructed a superior cell factory in Corynebacterium glutamicum for high-titer HA biosynthesis through systematic design and metabolic engineering based on a genome-scale metabolic model, iCW773. The OptForce algorithm was used in iCW773 to determine genetic interventions by using flux balance analysis. Enhancement of the HA biosynthesis pathway and attenuation of the glycolysis pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway and the dehydrogenation of pyruvate were predicted as targets for genetic modulations. Various genetic strategies were employed, including an additional promoter, P, driving hasB expression, antisense RNA-mediated attenuation of fba, zwf deletion and lactate/ pathway knockout. The integrated genetic changes in recombinant C. glutamicum produced 24.5 g/L HA in a fed-batch culture. Finally, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was further reduced by antisense RNA and initial codon mutation to divert carbon flux from byproducts to HA. The corresponding modified strain, CgHA25, achieved a titer of 28.7 g/L. The byproduct concentration was reduced by half, and the major -average molecular  (M) component was 0.21 MDa.

Chitosan is a promising household water coagulant, but needs parameters for use. This study tested the effects of chitosan dose, molecular  (MW), degree of deacetylation (DD), and functional groups on bentonite and kaolinite turbidity reduction in model household drinking water. Higher MW or DD produced greater reductions. Highest reductions were at doses 1 and 3 mg/L by MW >50,000 or >70% DD (residual turbidity <5 NTU). Higher doses did not necessarily continually increase reduction. For functional groups, 3 mg/L produced the highest reductions by lactate, , and HCl, and lower reductions of kaolinite than bentonite. Doses where the point of zero charge was observed clustered around 3 mg/L. Chitosan reduced clay turbidity in water; effectiveness was influenced by dose, clay type, MW, DD, and functional groups. Reduction did not necessarily increase with MW. Bentonite had a broader effective dose range and higher reduction at the optimal dose than kaolinite. Chitosans with and without functional groups performed similarly. The best of the studied doses was 3 mg/L. Chitosans are promising for turbidity reduction in low-resource settings if combined with sedimentation and/or filtration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302308>Effects of starter feeding on caecal mucosal bacterial composition and expression of genes involved in immune and tight junctions in pre-weaned twin lambs.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to explore the effects of starter feeding on caecal mucosal bacterial composition and the expression of genes involved in immune and tight junctions in pre-weaned lambs. Six pairs of new-born twin lambs were selected. From 10 days of age, one lamb of each pair received ewe's milk only (M group, n = 6), while the other one was fed ewe's milk plus starter feed (M + S group, n = 6). At 56 days of age, the lambs were sacrificed, and then cecum digesta was collected to measure pH values and concentrations of volatile fatty acid (VFA), and caecal mucosa were collected to determine the changes in bacterial communities and the mRNA expression of cytokines, toll-like receptors (TLRs) and tight junction proteins. The results showed the  and average daily gain were not significantly different between both groups. Starter feeding significantly (P < 0.05) increased the concentrations of propionate and butyrate; the proportions of , propionate and butyrate to total concentrations of VFA; and decreased the ratio of  to propionate in caecal contents. Principal coordinate analysis showed that samples from the M + S group could be distinguished from those from the M group; starter feeding also increased the diversity of caecal mucosal bacteria. At the genus level, starter feeding significantly (FDR < 0.05) increased the relative abundance of Alistipes, Parabacteroides, Parasutterella and Butyricimonas, and caused a decreasing trend (FDR < 0.10) in the relative abundance of Campylobacter and Helicobacter. The real-time PCR results showed that starter feeding significantly (FDR < 0.05) decreased the relative mRNA expression level of IL-12, TNF-α and TLR4 and increased the relative mRNA expression level of claudin-4. These results indicate that starter feeding altered caecal mucosal bacterial communities and decreased the expression of inflammatory factors, which may be beneficial in alleviating the weaning stress of lambs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This longevity extension differs from dietary restriction based on a number of features, including the relatively small effects on  and the sex-specificity of the lifespan effect. By inhibiting host digestion, acarbose increases the flux of starch to the lower digestive system, resulting in changes to the gut microbiota and their fermentation products. Given the documented health benefits of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the dominant products of starch fermentation by gut bacteria, this secondary effect of acarbose could contribute to increased longevity in mice. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the fecal microbiome of mice treated with acarbose to control mice at three independent study sites.Microbial communities and the concentrations of SCFAs in the feces of mice treated with acarbose were notably different from those of control mice. At all three study sites, the bloom of a single bacterial taxon was the most obvious response to acarbose treatment. The blooming populations were classified to the largely uncultured Bacteroidales family Muribaculaceae and were the same taxonomic unit at two of the three sites. Propionate concentrations in feces were consistently elevated in treated mice, while the concentrations of  and butyrate reflected a dependence on study site. Across all samples, Muribaculaceae abundance was strongly correlated with propionate and community composition was an important predictor of SCFA concentrations. Cox proportional hazards regression showed that the fecal concentrations of , butyrate, and propionate were, together, predictive of mouse longevity even while controlling for sex, site, and acarbose.We observed a correlation between fecal SCFAs and lifespan in mice, suggesting a role of the gut microbiota in the longevity-enhancing properties of acarbose. Treatment modulated the taxonomic composition and fermentation products of the gut microbiome, while the site-dependence of the responses illustrate the challenges facing reproducibility and interpretation in microbiome studies. These results motivate future studies exploring manipulation of the gut microbial community and its fermentation products for increased longevity, testing causal roles of SCFAs in the observed effects of acarbose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480144>Effects of replacement of para-grass with oil palm compounds on , food intake, nutrient digestibility, rumen functions and blood parameters in goats.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the beneficial effects of dietary supplementation with oil palm frond (leaf) (OPF) with and without oil palm meal (OPM) on nutrient intake and digestibility, ruminal fermentation and growth performance in goats.Six female crossbred goats were fed for 28 days of 3 diet treatments; 100 % para-grass (T1); 50 % para-grass + 50 % OPF (T2), and 30 % para-grass + 50 % OPF + 20 % OPM (T3). , rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR) and urine volume, food intake (FI), dry matter intake (DMI) and water intake (WI) were measured daily. Nutrient digestibility was determined from five consecutive days of last week in each diet. Ruminal fluid, urine and blood were collected at the end for determination of rumen protozoa and VFA contents, urinary allantoin excretion, blood cell count and chemistry profiles.Goats fed T2 and T3 showed higher dry matter and nutrients intakes while protein digestibility was suppressed compared with those for T1. Crude fat digestibility declined in T2 but maintained after adding the OPM (T3). High fat intake by giving OPF and OPM corresponded to a higher ruminal /propionate ratio (C2/C3) and serum cholesterol level. An increased urinary allantoin/creatinine ratio was found in T2 and T3 compared with T1, implying an increased number of ruminal microbes.Increased dry matter intake in T2 and T3 suggested that oil palm by-products are partly useful as a replacement for para-grass in goats. Replacement with the by-products increased plasma cholesterol level, which suggested that these products are a useful energy source. Changes in rumen parameters suggested an increased microbial number and activity suitable for  production. However, the limited digestibility of protein implies that addition of high protein feeds may be recommended to increase  gain of goats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029727>Essential oil composition of five Nepeta species cultivated in Lithuania and evaluation of their bioactivities, toxicity and antioxidant potential of hydrodistillation residues.</a></h2><p>Essential oils of Nepeta cataria var. citriodora, N. transcaucasica, N. melissifolia, N. sibirica and N. nuda were investigated.

The best-characterized OBP, LUSH (OBP76a) enhances pheromone sensitivity enabling detection of physiological levels of the male-specific pheromone, 11- vaccenyl . The role of the other OBPs encoded in the  genome is largely unknown. Here, using CRISPR-Cas9 we generated and characterized the loss of function phenotype for two genes encoding homologous OBPs, OS-E (OBP83b) and OS-F (OBP83a). Instead of activation defects, these extracellular proteins are required for normal deactivation of odorant responses to a subset of odorants. Remarkably, odorants detected by the same odorant receptor are differentially affected by the loss of the OBPs, revealing an odorant-specific role in deactivation kinetics. In stark contrast to  mutants, the  mutants have normal activation kinetics to the affected odorants, even at low stimulus concentrations, suggesting these OBPs are not competing for these ligands with the odorant receptors. We also show that  and  are functionally redundant as either is sufficient to revert the mutant phenotype in transgenic rescue experiments. These findings expand our understanding of the roles of OBPs to include deactivation of odorant responses.Copyright © 2019, Genetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305922>Association of Obesity With Multiple Sclerosis Risk and Response to First-line Disease Modifying Drugs in Children.</a></h2><p>Obesity reportedly increases the risk of pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS), but little is known about its association with disease course.To investigate the association of obesity with pediatric MS risk and with first-line therapy response among children with MS.This single-center retrospective study used the medical records and database at the Center for MS in Childhood and Adolescence, Göttingen, Germany.

Data were collected from July 14, 2016, to December 18, 2017.Data on BMIs were stratified by sex and age using German BMI references and compared with the BMI data of 14 747 controls from a nationwide child health survey for odds ratio (OR) estimates. Baseline magnetic resonance imaging findings, intervals between first and second MS attacks, annualized relapse rates before and during treatment with interferon beta-1a or -1b and glatiramer , frequency of second-line treatment, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were compared between nonoverweight (BMI≤90th percentile), overweight (BMI>90th-97th percentile), and obese (BMI>97th percentile) patients.In total, 453 patients with pediatric MS were included, of whom 306 (67.5%) were female, and the mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 13.7 (2.7) years. At diagnosis, 126 patients (27.8%) were overweight or obese, with obesity associated with statistically significant twofold odds of MS in both sexes (girls OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.5-3.1; P < .001 vs boys OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.3-3.5; P = .003). Obese patients, compared with nonoverweight patients, had statistically significantly more relapses on first-line treatment with interferon beta and glatiramer  (ARR, 1.29 vs 0.72; P < .001) and a higher rate of second-line treatment (21 [56.8%] of 37 vs 48 [38.7%] of 124; P = .06). Baseline neuroimaging, interval between first and second MS attacks, pretreatment relapses, and EDSS progression scores were not correlated with BMI.In this study, increased pediatric MS risk appeared to be associated with obesity, and obese patients did not respond well to first-line medications; altered pharmacokinetics appeared to be most likely factors in treatment response, suggesting that achieving healthy  or adjusting the dose according to BMI could improve therapy response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295470>Ocimum kilimandscharicum L. restores ovarian functions in letrozole - induced Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in rats: Comparison with metformin.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most common causes of female infertility, affecting 5-10% of the population. Women with PCOS manifest hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinemia, low-grade systemic inflammation, and polycystic ovaries. Unfortunately, current available medications are only symptomatic without relevant reported treatment. Therefore, a pressing need for alternative safe approaches is necessitated. To this end, the present study is designed to investigate therapeutic merits of the edible plant: Ocimum kilimandscharicum (Ok), in a letrozole PCOS rat model, and compare it to metformin.PCOS rats were treated with Ok total extract and its different fractions at 100 mg/kg orally for 10 consecutive days. Moreover, phytochemical characterization was applied using HPLC/PDA/ESI-MS to identify different secondary metabolites in the bioactive fractions.Results revealed that the total extract (Ok) and ethyl  (EA) fraction improved insulin sensitivity and restored normal hormonal and lipid profiles as well as normal morphological structure of the reproductive system. Furthermore, elevation of SOD and reduction of VEGF levels in comparison with metformin were recorded.These results suggest that Ok extract and EA fraction halt letrozole-induced reproductive dysfunctions and restore normal morphological and physiological functions in PCOS rats, even superior to metformin.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Four experimental diets were formulated to include 5% of either fresh canola oil (0 mEq/kg of peroxide value) or oxidized canola oil (180 mEq/kg of peroxide value). An equal portion of each diet was supplemented with 0.1% TA. Eight pigs (initial  of 82.89 ± 2.26 kg) were surgically fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum. At the beginning of the experiments, all pigs were fed a nitrogen-free diet for 7 d. Then, they were assigned to 4 dietary treatments according to an incomplete replicated 4 × 3 Latin square design with 3 periods to give 6 replicates per treatment. Each experimental period lasted for 9 d, starting with a 5-d adaptation period followed by 2 consecutive 2-d periods for fecal (day 6 and day 7) and ileal digesta (day 8 and day 9) collection. The inclusion of oxidized oil reduced (P < 0.05) the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of Pro and the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of NDF. Also, pigs fed the oxidized oil tended to have lower (P ≤ 0.10) lactate and ammonia-nitrogen concentrations in the ileum and lower (P ≤ 0.10)  and propionate concentrations in the feces than those fed the fresh oil. The supplementation of 0.1% TA reduced (P < 0.05) the AID of NDF and the ATTD of gross energy, crude protein, and NDF. Additionally, the TA-supplemented diet tended to have a lower (P ≤ 0.10) digestible energy content than the nonsupplemented diet. Pigs fed the TA-supplemented diet showed reduced (P < 0.05) AID and SID of His, Cys, and Pro compared with those fed the nonsupplemented diet. There were interactive effects (P < 0.05) of oxidized oil and TA supplementation on , isovalerate, total short chain fatty acids, and pH level in the ileum. In conclusion, the results indicated that the effects of oxidized oil are greater on microbial activities rather than nutrient digestibility. Although negative effects of dietary TA supplementation were observed in relation to nutrient digestibility, TA supplementation was found to ameliorate these negative effects of oxidized oil on microbial metabolites. Therefore, further studies are required to investigate the interaction between dietary oxidized oil and TA in relation with the gut microbiota in pigs.© The Author(s) 2019.

In MFCs with metolachlor as the sole carbon source, the degradation efficiency accelerated by 98%, with 61-76% of enhancement for the degradates, ethane sulfonic acid and oxanilic acid, respectively. According to quantifying primary metabolites of deschloro and metolachlor-2-hydroxyas, dechlorination and alcoholization were deemed as antecedent steps of metolachlor bioelectrochemical degradation. The energy recovery was infeasible by sole addition of metolachlor (at 13 ± 4 °C from equivalent  of 0.224 mg). In MFCs with metolachlor and sodium  as the concomitant carbon sources, the electricity generation recovered to a level comparable to the controls, instead of increasing the removal efficiency of metolachlor. These results suggest that a low-efficiently direct electron transfer occurred between electricigens and metolachlor degraders. The Illumina sequencing showed that species of Paracoccus and Aquamicrobium played a potential degradation effect, while Comamonas sp. replaced Geobacter sp. as the predominant electricigen after addition of metolachlor. This study demonstrates that MFCs could be used as a promising alternative for treatment of chloroacetanilide herbicide contaminated wastewaters by means of a rapidly established active bacterial community.

Four dietary supplementation treatments were imposed; non-supplementation (control, T1); supplementation of RP fed at 2% of DMI (low, T2); supplementation of RP fed at 4% of DMI (medium, T3) and supplementation of RP fed at 6% of DMI (high, T4). All cattle were given a concentrate supplement at 1 % of  while Napier grass was provided as a free choice.The findings revealed that RP supplementation did not negatively affect (P>0.05) DM intake of Napier grass, while RP intake and total DMI were the greatest in the RP supplementation at 4 and 6%DMI. Nevertheless, the nutrients (DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF) digestibilities were not changed in the RP supplementation groups. Rumen fermentation parameters especially those of total volatile fatty acids,  and butyrate were not significantly changed. However, the propionate concentration was remarkably increased (P<0.05) in the RP supplementation. Notably, the ratio of  to propionate, the number of protozoa, as well as the methane estimation were significantly reduced in the RP supplemented groups (4 and 6 % of DMI), while the counts of bacteria was not altered.Supplementation of RP (4% of DMI) improved rumen propionate production, reduced protozoal population and methane estimation (P<0.05) without a negative effect on DM consumption and nutrients total tract digestibilities in beef cattle. Using dietary rambutan fruit peel powder has potential promise as a rumen regulator.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744084>Antioxidant, α-Amylase and α-Glucosidase Inhibitory Activities and Potential Constituents of  Bark.</a></h2><p>The fruits of  are commonly used as foods and cooking ingredients in Vietnam, Laos, and the southeast region of China, whilst the leaves are traditionally used for treating diarrhea and rheumatism. This study was conducted to investigate the potential use of this plant bark as antioxidants, and α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitors. Five different extracts of  bark (TDB) consisting of the extract (TDBS) and factional extracts hexane (TDBH), ethyl  (TDBE), butanol (TDBB), and water (TDBW) were evaluated. The TDBS extract contained the highest amount of total phenolic (112.14 mg gallic acid equivalent per g dry ), while the TDBB extract had the most effective antioxidant capacity compared to other extracts. Its IC values were 12.33, 47.87, 33.25, and 103.74 µg/mL in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (ABTS), reducing power (RP), and nitric oxide (NO) assays, respectively. Meanwhile, the lipid peroxidation inhibition of the four above extracts was proximate to that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as a standard antioxidant. The result of porcine pancreatic α-amylase inhibition showed that TDB extracts have promising effects which are in line with the commercial diabetic inhibitor acarbose. Interestingly, the inhibitory ability on α-glucosidase of all the extracts was higher than that of acarbose. Among the extracts, the TDBB extract expressed the strongest activity on the enzymatic reaction (IC = 18.93 µg/mL) followed by the TDBW extract (IC = 25.27 µg/mL), TDBS (IC = 28.17 µg/mL), and TDBE extract (IC = 141.37 µg/mL). The phytochemical constituents of the TDB extract were identified by gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The principal constituents included nine phenolics, eight terpenoids, two steroids, and five compounds belonging to other chemical classes, which were the first reported in this plant. Among them, the presence of α- and β-amyrins were identified by GC-MS and appeared as the most dominant constituents in TDB extracts (1.52 mg/g). The results of this study revealed that  bark possessed rich phenolics and terpenoids, which might confer on reducing risks from diabetes. A high quantity of α- and β-amyrins highlighted the potentials of anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-tumor, and hepatoprotective properties of  bark.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899818>Effects of  extracts on lipid oxidation in fish feeds and growth performance of juvenile Jian carp ( var.

Jian). Firstly, fish feeds were respectively added with EQ, and ethyl ether extract, ethyl  extract (EAE), acetone extract, ethanol extract (EE) and aqueous extract (AQE) of , except for the control. The results showed that EAs and EQ inhibited lipid oxidation in fish feeds ( < 0.05). Of all of the examined EAs, EAE showed the strongest protective effects against lipid oxidation ( < 0.05). Moreover, EAE at high concentrations showed a stronger effect on lipid oxidation compared with EQ ( < 0.05). Then, 7 experimental diets respectively supplemented with 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 g/kg of EAE were fed to the respective treatment groups for 30 d. Four replicates were performed for each treatment group; 20 carp (mean : 12.10 ± 0.13 g) were in each replicate. The results indicated that dietary EAE improved the growth performance in carp ( < 0.05). The appropriate concentration of EAE for carp growth was estimated to be 3.643 g/kg diet. Thus, EAE could be used as a natural antioxidant in feeds for Jian carp.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061376>The Use of Enteric Capsules for Releasing a Fragrance over an Extended Period of Time.</a></h2><p>A system for releasing a fragrance, citral (CR) over an extended period of time using three types of enteric capsules is reported. The L- and M-type capsules released CR into media with a pH above 6, while the H-type capsule released CR at a pH above 7. The pH of the releasing medium was controlled by sodium borate (SB), i.e., by adding SB-methylcellulose (MC) prepared in different  ratios (SB-MC 1 : 2, 1 : 1 and 2 : 1) to tablets and by compressing them at different pressures. The tablet containing a large amount of SB and that was pressed at higher pressures permitted the pH of the releasing medium to be changed from 5 to 9, at 4-5 h after the addition of SB to the tablets, while negligible changes were observed for tablets containing low amounts of SB and which were compressed at lower pressures. Reflecting these pH changes, CR was released after different periods of time when SB-MC tablets and capsules containing CR were simultaneously added to the releasing medium. When enteric capsules containing CR and the pH adjusting tablets were simultaneously added to a benzyl  (BA) solution, BA was released at a constant rate, while CR was released for different periods of time depending on the type of capsule used. The results suggest that fragrances could be released over different time frames by using enteric capsules and pH adjusting agents, for example, the release of fragrances with sedative effects at night time and with stimulating effects in the morning.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323300>β-carboline alkaloids attenuate bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice through inhibiting NF-kb/p65 phosphorylation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.</a></h2><p>The plant Arenaria kansuensis is used in traditional medicine to treat lung inflammation for a long time. However, the anti-pulmonary fibrosis effect and its corresponding bioactive constituents of this plant have not been studied extensively.The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-pulmonary fibrosis effect and its corresponding bioactive constituents of A. kansuensis and its possible mechanism.In vivo experiment, the anti-pulmonary fibrosis effects of the fraction (Part1) enriched from ethyl  extracts of the whole plant A. kansuensis were evaluated through bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice (five groups, n = 10) daily at doses of 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg for 15 days. In vitro experiment, the anti-inflammation and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) effect of 12 β-carboline alkaloids isolated from Part1 were evaluated through lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 inflammatory cell model and TGF-β1 induced A549 cell model.In this study, a fraction named Part1 extracted from Arenaria kansuensis presented strong anti-pulmonary fibrosis effect at the dose of 150 mg/kg. Vivo experiments showed that the survival rate and  of mice significantly increased after Part1 treatment. Part1 could significantly inhibit the initial of inflammation, deposition of collagen and expression of TGF-β1 and α-SMA, moreover, the expression of E-cadherin was significantly elevated after administration of Part1. All the cure effects of Part1 were in dose dependent manner. A total of 12 β-carboline alkaloids were identified in Part1 and they all showed suppressive effect on inflammatory cytokines including MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β through inhibition of NF-kb/p65 phosphorylation, and that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process was reversed by different compounds in different levels. The expression of indicators of EMT including α-SMA, vimentin and E-cadherin was significantly improved after given different β-carboline alkaloids.This study showed that antifibrogenic effect of β-carboline alkaloids was due to inhibiting the initial of inflammation through NF-kb/p65 pathway and reversing the process of EMT.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Rats were euthanized at week 5 to collect blood for superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay, and uterus for histomorphological study and expression analyses of epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).Results revealed that LA causes destruction of uterine lining cells and necrosis of uterine glands of exposed rats without EBN supplement while the degree of damage decreased among EBN treated groups; T3 showed the highest ameliorating effect against LA toxicity, as well as an increased number of uterine glands. Increased levels of SOD were also achieved in EBN supplemented groups than the controls. Results of immunohistochemistry showed significantly higher expressions of EGF, VEGF, and PCNA levels (p<0.05) in T3 compared to other treatments.

Our recent study showed that the low-birth- (LBW) piglets harbored a different fecal microbiota compared to normal-birth- (NBW) piglets during early life with a lower abundance of the genus . Considering the spatial variations in gut microbiota at distinct gut locations, this study was designed to further investigate the differences in the microbiota composition and predominant  species in the ileum and colon between LBW and NBW piglets during early life, including day 7 (D7), day 21 (D21, before weaning), and day 35 (D35, 2 weeks after weaning). Compared with the normal group, LBW piglets harbored a significantly lower proportion of short-chain fatty acids producing microbes, such as Ruminococcaceae and Prevotellaceae in the ileum on D7,  and Lachnospiraceae in the colon on D7,  in the colon on D21, and  in the colon on D35. The relative abundance of the phylum Bacteroidetes was also declined in both ileum and colon of LBW piglets on D7. Meanwhile, the levels of total SCFAs on D7, D21, and D35,  and valerate on D7 and D21, propionate on D21, and lactate on D21 and D35, were also declined in the colon of LBW piglets. Moreover, functional alterations in the gut microbiota of LBW piglets were characterized by differentially abundant microbial genes involved in multiple pathways such as amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, replication and repair, and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins in the colon. Additionally, lower numbers of  on D7 and  on D21 resided in the colon of LBW piglets compared to those in the normal ones. Collectively, LBW piglets have altered bacterial communities, microbial metabolism and gene functions in the ileum and colon during early life, especially the colonic community. This work will help to develop novel ideas in identifying the reliable biomarkers affecting the gut microbiota development in LBW piglets during early life and facilitate the development of new nutritional interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761628>Growth performance, biochemical, cytological and molecular aspects of rabbits exposed to lead toxicity.</a></h2><p>Heavy metals have enormous variety of deleterious effects on many organs in the . This study demonstrated the toxic influences of lead on the growth, biochemical, cellular and molecular aspects of developing rabbits. Seventy-five rabbits (New Zealand NZW) were divided into five equal groups as follows; control (C) and four treatment groups (T1-4) orally administered lead  solution as follow T1: 20, T2: 30, T3: 50 and T4: 70 mg/kg . Lead resulted in a significant decrease in live , daily  gain and feed intake in T3 and T4 compared to those in other groups. Blood haematology measurements such as red blood cells, haematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume, platelet, white blood cells and lymphocytes were significantly influenced by the high level of lead. Oral administration of lead significantly reduced total proteins in the serum. It was observed that the high lead level led to significantly (p < 0.05) increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase enzymes, urea and creatinine. Four random amplified polymorphic DNA primers polymorphism were detected among the treatment groups. Total number of induced bands (loss or appearance) compared with control group were 4, 10, 10 and 14 bands using primers P1, P2, P3 and P4 respectively. Number of micronuclei showed a dose-response increase and the difference was highly significant especially between control compared with T3 and T4 groups. From our results, we can conclude that exposure of rabbits to lead  resulted in negative effects on the growth performance and altered the haematological and biochemical parameters, in addition to its adverse impact on cytological and molecular characterization of animals.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31342307>Inhibition of Human Serum Paraoxonase-I with Antimycotic Drugs: In Vitro and In Silico Studies.</a></h2><p>Drugs show their pharmacological effects by inhibiting or activating enzymes.

However, Amphotericin B's high molecular  compared to other antifungal drugs, such as miconazole and clotrimazole, and poor water solubility hampers its efficacy at the physiological conditions of the oropharyngeal cavity (saliva pH, limited volume for dissolution) and thereby limits its clinical use in oropharyngeal candidiasis. We have prepared fast-dissolving orodispersible films with high loading (1% ) using solvent casting that enables amphotericin B to remain solubilised in saliva in equilibrium between the monomeric and dimeric states, and able to produce a local antifungal effect. Optimisation of the amphotericin B-loaded orodispersible films was achieved by quality by design studies combining dextran and/or maltodextrin as dextrose-derived-polymer film formers with cellulose-derived film formers (hydroxypropylmethyl/hydroxypropyl cellulose in a 1:4  ratio), sorbitol for taste masking, microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel 200) or microcrystalline cellulose-carboxymethylcellulose sodium (Avicel CL-611) for enhancing the mechanical strength of the film, and polyethylene glycol 400 and glycerol (1:1 ) as plasticizers. The optimised amphotericin B orodispersible films (containing 1% AmB, 25% dextran, 25% maltodextrin, 5% sorbitol, 10% Avicel 200, 10% polyethylene glycol 400, 10% glycerol, 3% hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose  succinate, 12% hydroxypropyl cellulose) possessed a fast disintegration time (60 ± 3 s), quick release in artificial saliva (>80% in 10 min), high burst strength (2190 mN mm) and high efficacy against several  spp. (,  and ) (>15 mm inhibition halo). Amphotericin B orodispersible films are stable for two weeks at room temperature (25 °C) and up to 1 year in the fridge. Although further toxicological and in vivo efficacy studies are required, this novel Amphotericin B orodispersible films is a promising, physicochemically stable formulation with potential wide application in clinical practice, especially for immunocompromised patients suffering from oropharyngeal candidiasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31190979> control is vital for patients with early-stage endometrial cancer or complex atypical hyperplasia who have received progestin therapy to spare fertility: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p> This study aimed to identify potential prognostic factors for patients with complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) or early-stage endometrial cancer (EC) who received progestin therapy to spare fertility and, thus, improve the management of this patient group.  The PubMed, PMC, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched for correlational studies published in English. Studies that evaluated the prognosis of patients with CAH or early-stage EC were pooled for a systematic review and meta-analysis.  In total, 31 eligible studies, including 8 prospective and 23 retrospective studies involving 1099 patients, were included in this analysis. The most commonly used progestin agents were medroxyprogesterone  (MPA, 47.0%) and megestrol  (MA, 25.5%). The total complete response (CR) rate was 75.8% (833/1099), and the median time to CR with first-line progestin therapy was 6 months. In total, 294 (26.8%) patients who achieved CR became pregnant spontaneously (28 cases) or through assisted reproductive technology (127 cases). During the median follow-up of 39 months, 245 (22.3%) women developed recurrence. Only one patient (0.09%) died of the disease. The meta-analysis showed that compared to a BMI<25 kg/m and CAH, a  mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m (=0.0004, odds ratios (OR), 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.6) and EC (=0.0000, OR, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.6) were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of a CR.

Data were collected from 229 published papers with 938 treatment means. The data set was randomly split into a training data set containing 70% of the observations and a test data set with the remaining observations. A series of ANN with a range of 1 to 9 artificial neurons in 1 hidden layer were examined, and the best one was selected to compare with the best-fitted MLR model. The performance of model predictions was evaluated by root mean square errors (RMSE) and concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) using cross-evaluations with 100 iterations. When using the ANN to predict ruminal pH and concentrations of ammonia, total VFA, , propionate, and butyrate, the RMSE were 4.2, 41.4, 20.9, 22.3, 32.9, and 29.7% of observed means, respectively. The RMSE for the MLR were 4.2, 37.8, 18.3, 19.9, 29.8, and 26.6% of the observed means. The CCC for ruminal pH, ruminal concentrations of ammonia, total VFA, , propionate, and butyrate were 0.57, 0.49, 0.45, 0.40, 0.52, and 0.40, using the ANN, and 0.37, 0.48, 0.40, 0.29, 0.43, and 0.35, using the MLR. Evaluations of the MLR and the ANN indicated that these 2 model forms exhibited similar prediction errors, with 4.2, 39.6, 19.6, 21.1, 31.3, and 28.1% of observed means for pH, ammonia, total VFA, , propionate, and butyrate. Although the ANN increased the precision of predictions related to ruminal metabolism, it failed to improve the accuracy compared with the linear regression model.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

This study investigates the correlation between the availability of a critical cofactor, acetyl-CoA, the concentration of a limiting precursor, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), and the molecular  of HA (MW) produced by recombinant Lactococcus lactis MKG6 cultures. This strain expressed three heterologous HA-pathway genes obtained from the has operon of Streptococcus zooepidemicus in an ldh-mutant host strain, L. lactis NZ9020. A flux balance analysis, performed using the L. lactis genome-scale metabolic network, showed a positive correlation of acetyl-CoA flux with the UDP-GlcNAc flux and the experimental data on HA productivity. To increase the intracellular levels of acetyl-CoA,  was supplemented as a pulse feed in anaerobic batch cultures. However,  is effectively utilized only in the presence of glucose and exhaustion of glucose resulted in decreasing the final MW (1.5 MDa). Co-supplementation of  resulted in enhancing the acetyl-CoA and UDP-GlcNAc levels as well as the MW to 2.5 MDa. This logic was extended to fed-batch cultures, designed with a pH-based feedback control of glucose feeding and pulse  supplementation. When the glucose feed concentration was optimally adjusted to prevent glucose exhaustion or accumulation, the  utilization was found to be high, resulting in significantly enhanced levels of acetyl-CoA and UDP-GlcNAc as well as a MW of 3.4 MDa, which was sustained at this value throughout the process. This study provides the possibility of commercially producing high MW using recombinant L. lactis strains.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30789221>Attenuating effects of guanidinoacetic acid on preslaughter transport-induced muscle energy expenditure and rapid glycolysis of broilers.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the effects of dietary guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) supplementation on growth performance, plasma variables, muscle energy status, glycolytic potential, and meat quality of broilers experiencing transport stress during the summer. A total of 320 28-day-old male Arbor Acres broilers were randomly allotted to 3 dietary treatments, including a GAA-free basal control diet (160 birds) and basal diet supplementation with 600 (80 birds) or 1,200 mg/kg (80 birds) GAA for 14 D. On the morning of day 42, after an 8-h fast, the birds fed basal diets were divided into 2 equal groups, and all birds in the 4 groups of 80 birds were transported according to the following protocols: 1) a 0.5-h transport of birds on basal diets (as a lower-stress control group), 2) a 3-h transport of birds on basal diets, and a 3-h transport of birds on basal diets supplemented with either 3) 600 or 4) 1,200 mg/kg GAA. The results revealed that dietary supplementation with GAA at 600 and 1,200 mg/kg for 14 D prior to slaughter did not affect growth performance, carcass traits, and most textural characteristics and chemical composition of the pectoralis major (PM) muscle (P > 0.05). In the GAA-free group, a 3-h transport increased the broiler live  loss, elevated the plasma corticosterone concentration, decreased the plasma glucose concentration, muscle concentrations of ATP, creatine and energy charge value, increased the muscle AMP concentration and AMP/ATP ratio, and accelerated glycolysis metabolism, which resulted in inferior meat quality (lower pH and higher drip loss, P < 0.05). However, dietary addition of GAA at 1,200 mg/kg increased the mRNA expression of S-adenosyl-l-methionine: N-guanidino- methyltransferase in the liver and creatine transporter in both the liver and PM muscle. It also elevated muscle concentrations of creatine and phosphocreatine (P < 0.05), which helps improve meat quality by ameliorating the 3-h transport-induced muscle energy expenditure and delaying anaerobic glycolysis of broilers.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894457>CXA-10, a Nitrated Fatty Acid, Is Renoprotective in Deoxycorticosterone -Salt Nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Underlying pathogenic mechanisms in chronic kidney disease (CKD) include chronic inflammation, oxidant stress, and matrix remodeling associated with dysregulated nuclear factor- B, nuclear factor- B, and SMAD signaling pathways, respectively. Important cytoprotective mechanisms activated by oxidative inflammatory conditions are mediated by nitrated fatty acids that covalently modify proteins to limit inflammation and oxidant stress. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of chronic treatment with CXA-10 (10-nitro-9(E)-octadec-9-enoic acid) in the uninephrectomized deoxycorticosterone -high-salt mouse model of CKD. After 4 weeks of treatment, CXA-10 [2.5 millligrams per kilogram (mpk), p.o.] significantly attenuated increases in plasma cholesterol, heart , and kidney  observed in the model without impacting systemic arterial blood pressure. CXA-10 also reduced albuminuria, nephrinuria, glomerular hypertrophy, and glomerulosclerosis in the model. Inflammatory MCP-1 and fibrosis (collagen, fibronectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and osteopontin) renal biomarkers were significantly reduced in the CXA-10 (2.5 mpk) group. The anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects, as well as glomerular protection, were not observed in the enalapril-treated group. Also, CXA-10 appears to exhibit hormesis as all protective effects observed in the low-dose group were absent in the high-dose group (12.5 mpk). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that, at the appropriate dose, the nitrated fatty acid CXA-10 exhibits anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects in the kidney and limits renal injury in a model of CKD.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31416486>Changes in  and blood pressure among women using Depo-Provera injection in Northwest Ethiopia.</a></h2><p>Depo-Provera is an injectable contraceptive method containing medroxyprogesterone . It has some adverse effects like changes in menstrual pattern, loss in bone mineral density and risk of  gain. Therefore, this study is aimed at to investigate the effects of Depo-Provera on  and blood pressure among Ethiopian women. Institution based cross-sectional study design was conducted from January 2017 to April 2017. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 software. Paired t test, independent t-test and ANOVA were used to evaluate the presence of mean difference and relationship between changes in variables and duration of use of Depo-Provera. P-value ≤ 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.The mean  and  mass index (BMI) of Depo-Provera users were increased significantly (p = 0.02 for mean  and p = 0.019, for  mass index). There was no significant difference in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of Depo-Provera users compared to controls or their respective pretreatment value (p-value = 0.85 for Depo-Provera users and 0.67 for non-users). The finding of this study revealed that there is an increased  gain and BMI among Depo-Provera users compared to non-users, which really requires attention of health professionals and other stake holders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176812>Identifying a quick and efficient method of removing organic matter without damaging microplastic samples.</a></h2><p>Natural organic matter may confound the detection of microplastics, requiring a removal step. However, most available protocols are long and lack information on removal efficiency and polymer degradation. Thus, we have determined the digestion efficiency (%) for a pool of organic matter (algae, driftwood, feathers, fish muscle, paraffin, palm oil) for five digestion solutions, hydrogen peroxide (HO), hydrogen peroxide with iron catalyst (HO + Fe), potassium hydroxide (KOH), nitric acid (HNO), and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), under two temperatures (room temperature at 25 °C, 50 °C) and two periods (1, 6 h). HO + Fe and KOH at 50 °C for 1 h had the highest digestion efficiencies, of 65.9% and 58.3% respectively (mostly limited by driftwood and paraffin). Further testing revealed that HO + Fe is more appropriate for plant material and KOH for animal tissue.  loss (%), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and carbonyl index of 9 virgin and 6 weathered polymers (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride, cellulose , nylon) revealed that only identification of cellulose  was hindered. Filters were also tested revealing that quartz and glass fibre filters are resistant to these protocols. Thus, a digestion protocol based on HO + Fe or KOH at 50 °C for 1 h may be used on microplastic samples.Copyright © 2019.

Gut microbiota may play a regulatory role in gastrointestinal health, substrate metabolism, and peripheral tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver, and pancreas via its metabolites short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Animal and human data demonstrated that, in particular,  beneficially affects host energy and substrate metabolism via secretion of the gut hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY, which, thereby, affects appetite, via a reduction in whole- lipolysis, systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and via an increase in energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Thus, potential therapies to increase gut microbial fermentation and  production have been under vigorous scientific scrutiny. In this review, the relevance of the colonically and systemically most abundant SCFA  and its effects on the previously mentioned tissues will be discussed in relation to  control and glucose homeostasis. We discuss in detail the differential effects of oral  administration (vinegar intake), colonic  infusions, acetogenic fiber, and acetogenic probiotic administrations as approaches to combat obesity and comorbidities. Notably, human data are scarce, which highlights the necessity for further human research to investigate 's role in host physiology, metabolic, and cardiovascular health.</p></html>
