<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25516674>Prevalence, histologic and clinical characteristics of heterotopic gastric mucosa in Chinese patients.</a></h1><p>To determine the prevalence, demographic, clinical and histopathologic features of heterotopic gastric mucosa (HGM) in Chinese patients.Patients referred to three endoscopy units were enrolled in this study. The macroscopic characteristics of HGM were documented. Biopsies were obtained and observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Helicobacter pylori  was examined by Whartin-Starry staining.HGM was observed in 420 Chinese patients, yielding a prevalence of .4%. The majority of patients had a single patch (300/420; 71.4%), while the remainder had two (84/420; 20%) or multiple patches (36/420; 8.6%). The size of the patches and the distance from the patch to the frontal incisor teeth varied significantly. The large majority of HGM patches were flat (393/420; 93.6%), whereas the remaining patches were slightly elevated. The primary histological characteristic was fundic-type (216/420; 51.4%) within the HGM patch, and antral- (43/420; 10.2%) and transitional-type (65/420; .5%) mucosa were also observed. The prevalence of intestinal metaplasia was 3.1% (13/420) and the prevalence of dysplasia was 1.4% (6/420), indicating the necessity for endoscopic follow-up in patients with HGM. Esophageal and extraesophageal complaints were also observed in patients with HGM. Dysphagia and epigastric discomfort (odds ratios: 6.836 and 115.826, respectively;  < .05) were independent risk factors for HGM.Clinical complaints should be considered to improve the detection rate of HMG. The prevalence of intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia also indicates a need for endoscopic follow-up.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26512812>Membrane biofouling in a wastewater nitrification reactor: Microbial succession from autotrophic  to heterotrophic domination.</a></h1><p>Membrane biofouling is a complex process that involves bacterial adhesion, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) excretion and utilization, and species interactions. To obtain a better understanding of the microbial ecology of biofouling process, this study conducted rigorous, time-course analyses on the structure, EPS and microbial composition of the fouling layer developed on ultrafiltration membranes in a nitrification bioreactor. During a 14-day fouling event, three phases were determined according to the flux decline and microbial succession patterns. In Phase I (-2 days), small sludge flocs in the bulk liquid were selectively attached on membrane surfaces, leading to the formation of similar EPS and microbial community composition as the early biofilms. Dominant populations in small flocs, e.g., Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter, and Acinetobacter spp., were also the major initial colonizers on membranes. In Phase II (2-4 d), fouling layer structure, EPS composition, and bacterial community went through significant changes. Initial colonizers were replaced by fast-growing and metabolically versatile heterotrophs (e.g., unclassified Sphingobacteria). The declining EPS polysaccharide to protein (:PN) ratios could be correlated well with the increase in microbial community diversity. In Phase III (5-14 d), heterotrophs comprised over 90% of the community, whereas biofilm structure and EPS composition remained relatively stable. In all phases, AOB and NOB were constantly found within the top 40% of the fouling layer, with the maximum concentrations around % from the top. The overall microbial succession pattern from autotrophic  to heterotrophic domination implied that MBR biofouling could be alleviated by forming larger bacterial flocs in bioreactor suspension (reducing autotrophic ), and by designing more specific cleaning procedures targeting dominant heterotrophs during typical filtration cycles.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These patients had similar demographics, spirometry, Charlson Indexes, and APACHE-II scores when compared to patients who were not MRSA colonized (n=127), but MRSA colonized patients had more hospitalizations within the 2 years prior to admission (2 [1-4.8] versus 1 [-3],  = .03). While hospitalized, MRSA colonized patients had a longer length of stay (9 [5.3-.5] versus 5 [3-7.8] days,  = .01) and more antibiotic days (7 [5-10.8] versus 5 [-7] days,  = .01). They were also more likely to receive intensive care (51.5% versus 23.6%,  = .01) and to develop respiratory failure that required noninvasive ventilation (56.3% versus 38.2%,  = .05). Trends towards increased use of invasive mechanical ventilation and readmission within 30 days were also present.COPD patients colonized with MRSA have longer hospitalizations, require longer courses of antibiotics, and are more likely to require intensive care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26096753>Serum zinc concentration in cystic fibrosis patients with CFTR I1234V mutation associated with pancreatic sufficiency.</a></h1><p>To determine serum zinc (Zn) level among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with homozygous CFTR I1234V mutation associated with pancreatic sufficiency ().A cross-sectional study was conducted including both pediatric and adult CF patients. Data on age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), BMI Z-score, FEV1, and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection were collected. Serum Zn, albumin, and total proteins were measured and analyzed.Forty-five CF patients with homozygous CFTR I1234V mutation belonging to a large Arab kindred tribe and eight CF patients with other mutations associated with pancreatic insufficiency (PI). Patient's age ranged from 2 to 49 years with a mean age of .1 ± 9.1 years and mean plasma Zn of .78 ± . mcg/mL. Seven (13.2%) patients with CFTR I1234V and  had low Zn levels (<.6 mcg/mL). Mean age among Zn deficient group was significantly older. The mean FEV1 in the deficient group was found to be insignificant low. Persistent P. aeruginosa  was more prevalent in Zn deficient group. BMI Z-scosre of CF patients were positively correlated with Zn levels. Forty-five healthy subjects belonging to the same Arab tribe were selected in order to assess their Zn levels and their mean plasma Zn of .84 ± .11 mcg/mL (range .65-1.1 mcg/mL) with mean age 20.4 ± 10.1 years (range 6-40 years).These findings suggest that Zn deficiency can occur in CF patients with . The association of Zn levels and the frequency of P. aeruginosa isolated in CF patients need further investigation.© 2015 The Authors.
