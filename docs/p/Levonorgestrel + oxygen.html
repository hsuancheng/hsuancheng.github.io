<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31241895>Atomically Precise Gold- Nanocluster as a Radiosensitizer for Enhanced Cancer Therapy.</a></h2><p>Gold nanoclusters have become promising radiosensitizers due to their ultrasmall size and robust ability to adsorb, scatter, and re-emit radiation. However, most of the previously reported gold nanocluster radiosensitizers do not have a precise atomic structure, causing difficulties in understanding the structure-activity relationship. In this study, a structurally defined gold- nanocluster consisting of Au(CHO) (AuNC) with bright luminescence (58.7% quantum yield) and satisfactory biocompatibility was demonstrated as a nanoradiosensitizer. When the AuNCs were irradiated with X-rays, they produced reactive  species (ROS), resulting in irreversible cell apoptosis. As indicated by  tumor formation experiments, tumorigenicity was significantly suppressed after one radiotherapy treatment with the AuNCs. In addition, compared with tumors treated with X-rays (4 Gy) alone, tumors treated with the nanosensitizer exhibited an inhibition rate of 74.2%. This study contributes to the development of atomically precise gold nanoclusters as efficient radiosensitizers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28824796>Prenatal  exposure induces autism-like behavior in offspring through ERβ suppression in the amygdala.</a></h2><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairments in social communication and restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests. ASD is now diagnosed in more than one out of 100 children and is biased towards males by a ratio of at least 4:1. Many possible explanations and potential causative factors have been reported, such as genetics, sex, and environmental factors, although the detailed mechanisms of ASD remain unclear.The dams were exposed through oral contraceptives to either vehicle control (VEH) alone,  (LNG) alone, ethinyl estradiol (EE) alone, or a combination of LNG/EE for 21 days during their pregnancy. The subsequent 10-week-old offspring were used for autism-like behavior testing, and the limbic tissues were isolated for analysis. In another experimental group, 8-week-old male offspring were treated by infusion of ERβ overexpression/knockdown lentivirus in the amygdala, and the offspring were analyzed after 2 weeks.We show that prenatal exposure of either LNG alone or a LNG/EE combination, but not EE alone, results in suppression of ERβ (estrogen receptor β) and its target genes in the amygdala with autism-like behavior in male offspring, while there is a much smaller effect on female offspring. However, we find that there is no effect on the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Further investigation shows that ERβ suppression is due to LNG-mediated altered methylation on the ERβ promoter and results in tissue damage with oxidative stress and the dysfunction of  and fatty acid metabolism, which subsequently triggers autism-like behavior. Overexpression of ERβ in the amygdala completely restores LNG-induced ERβ suppression and autism-like behaviors in offspring, while ERβ knockdown mimics this effect, indicating that ERβ expression in the amygdala plays an important role in autism-like behavior development.We conclude that prenatal  exposure induces autism-like behavior in offspring through ERβ suppression in the amygdala. To our knowledge, this is the first time the potential effect of oral contraceptives on the contribution of autism-like behavior in offspring has been discovered.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27558046>Obama's science legacy: uneven progress on scientific integrity.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30758963>Spatially Explicit Large-Scale Environmental Risk Assessment of Pharmaceuticals in Surface Water in China.</a></h2><p>With improving healthcare and an aging population, the consumption of human pharmaceuticals in China has been increasing dramatically. Environmental risks posed by many active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are still unknown. This study used a spatially explicit dilution-factor methodology to model predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of 11 human-use APIs in surface water for a preliminary environmental risk assessment (ERA). Median PECs in surface water across China range between 0.01 and 8.0 × 10 ng/L for the different APIs, under a moderate patient use scenario. Higher environmental risks of APIs in surface water are in regions with high water stress, e.g., northern China. , estradiol, ethinyl estradiol and abiraterone acetate were predicted to potentially pose a high or moderate environmental risk in China if consumption levels reach those in Europe. Relative risks of these four APIs have the potential to be among those chemicals with the highest impact on surface water in China when compared to the risks associated with other regulated chemicals, including triclosan and some standard water quality parameters including BOD (5-day biological  demand), COD (chemical  demand), Cu, Zn, and Hg and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate. This method could support the regulation of this category of chemicals and risk mitigation strategies in China.</p></html>
