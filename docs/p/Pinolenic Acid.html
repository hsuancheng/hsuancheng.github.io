In this study, Δ12 and Δ12/Δ15 fatty  desaturases of the oleaginous yeast Lipomyces starkeyi, termed LsFad2 and LsFad3, respectively, were identified and characterized. Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing LsFAD2 converted oleic  (C18:1) to linoleic  (C18:2), while a strain of LsFAD3-expressing S. cerevisiae converted oleic  to linoleic , and linoleic  to α- (C18:3), indicating that LsFad2 and LsFad3 were Δ12 and bifunctional Δ12/Δ15 fatty  desaturases, respectively. The overexpression of LsFAD2 in L. starkeyi caused an accumulation of linoleic  and a reduction in oleic  levels. In contrast, overexpression of LsFAD3 induced the production of α-. Deletion of LsFAD2 and LsFAD3 induced the accumulation of oleic  and linoleic , respectively. Our findings are significant for the commercial production of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, in L. starkeyi.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27004414>Polymorphisms in FADS1 and FADS2 alter plasma fatty acids and desaturase levels in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease.</a></h2><p>To explore whether plasma fatty acids and SNPs in the fatty  desaturase (FADS) gene associated with type 2  (T2D) and coronary artery disease (CAD).In this cross-sectional study, we utilized gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis and the high-resolution melting method to detect plasma fatty acids and SNPs respectively (rs174537G>T, rs174616C>T, rs174460T>C, and rs174450A>C) in 234 T2D, 200 CAD, 185 T2D&CAD patients, and 253 healthy controls.We found that T2D&CAD patients had the highest plasma arachidonic , dihomo-gamma- and delta-6 desaturase, and the lowest stearic , , and saturated fatty acids; plasma eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  elevated in T2D patients, but significantly reduced in CAD patients.

Brain-capillary endothelial cells were grown to confluence on filters and exposed to eicosapentaenoic acids, gamma  and linoleic . Transepithelial electrical resistance was determined with voltage-measuring electrodes. The messenger RNA expression of occludin was quantitated by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

Cells cultured in eicosapentaenoic acids and gamma , but not , displayed a 2.7-fold increase in transepithelial electrical resistance at 10 microM in brain capillary endothelial cells. The expression level of occludin messenger RNA increased markedly immediately after the exposure to eicosapentaenoic acids or gamma .

In addition, the rise in transepithelial electrical resistance induced by eicosapentaenoic acids and gamma  was markedly inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and PP2 and protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C. In contrast, the rise in transepithelial electrical resistance induced by eicosapentaenoic acids and gamma  was not inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002. We conclude that eicosapentaenoic acids and gamma  increased the transepithelial electrical resistance and the expression of occludin messenger RNA in brain capillary endothelial cells.

Although some studies reported adverse effects, such as reproductive toxicity, further research needs to be done in order to assess its molecular effects and mechanism of action. Therefore, in the present work, we investigated metabolic perturbations in juvenile gilt-head bream (Sparus aurata) exposed over 14 days via the water to oxybenzone (50 mg/L). The non-targeted analysis of brain, liver and plasma extracts was performed by means of UHPLC-qOrbitrap MS in positive and negative modes with both C18 and HILIC separation. Although there was no mortality or alterations in general physiological parameters during the experiment, and the metabolic profile of brain was not affected, the results of this study showed that oxybenzone could perturb both liver and plasma metabolome. The pathway enrichment suggested that different pathways in  (fatty  elongation, α- , biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and fatty  ) were significantly altered, as well as metabolites involved in phenylalanine and tyrosine . Overall, these changes are signs of possible oxidative stress and energy  modification. Therefore, this research indicates that oxybenzone has adverse effects beyond the commonly studied hormonal activity, and demonstrates the sensitivity of metabolomics to assess molecular-level effects of emerging contaminants.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of several unsaturated fatty acids on cardiometabolic health, such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) docosahexaenoic  (DHA), α  (ALA), linoleic  (LA), and oleic  (OA) have received much attention in past years. In addition, results from recent studies revealed that several other uncommon fatty acids (fatty acids present at a low content or else not contained in usual foods), such as furan fatty acids, -3 docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and conjugated fatty acids, also have favorable effects on cardiometabolic health. In the present report, we searched the literature in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to review the research progress on anti-CVD effect of these uncommon fatty acids. DPA has a favorable effect on cardiometabolic health in a different way to other long-chain -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC -3 PUFAs), such as EPA and DHA. Furan fatty acids and conjugated  (CLNA) may be potential bioactive fatty acids beneficial for cardiometabolic health, but evidence from intervention studies in humans is still limited, and well-designed clinical trials are required. The favorable effects of conjugated linoleic  (CLA) on cardiometabolic health observed in animal or in vitro cannot be replicated in humans. However, most intervention studies in humans concerning CLA have only evaluated its effect on cardiometabolic risk factors but not its direct effect on risk of CVD, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be required to clarify this point. However, several difficulties and limitations exist for conducting RCTs to evaluate the effect of these fatty acids on cardiometabolic health, especially the high costs for purifying the fatty acids from natural sources.

Phospholipases D (PLDs) have been hypothesized to mediate this process, but data from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) regarding the role of PLDs in plant resistance have remained controversial. Here, we cloned two chloroplast-localized PLD genes from rice (Oryza sativa), OsPLDα4 and OsPLDα5, both of which were up-regulated in response to feeding by the rice striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis, mechanical wounding, and treatment with jasmonic  (JA). Antisense expression of OsPLDα4 and -α5 (as-pld), which resulted in a 50% reduction of the expression of the two genes, reduced elicited levels of , JA, green leaf volatiles, and ethylene and attenuated the SSB-induced expression of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMPK3), a lipoxygenase (OsHI-LOX), a hydroperoxide lyase (OsHPL3), as well as a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic  synthase (OsACS2). The impaired oxylipin and ethylene signaling in as-pld plants decreased the levels of herbivore-induced trypsin protease inhibitors and volatiles, improved the performance of SSB and the rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, and reduced the attractiveness of plants to a larval parasitoid of SSB, Apanteles chilonis.

In this study we evaluated the effects of a functional blended oil (BO) composed of a high level of oleic  (OA) (50.93%) and α- (ALA) (5.41%) on cardiovascular health, blood pressure (BP) and body weight (BW) in comparison with lard oil (LO) and peanut oil (PO). Ninety male Wistar rats were divided into three groups and fed for 12 weeks with BO, LO and PO. Each group was divided into low, middle and high fat groups and fed with oil supply ratios of 6.7%, 10.9% and 48.1%, respectively. After the feeding period, the rats were sacrificed, and data were collected and analyzed. Rats treated with BO especially at a high dose (HBO) showed a significantly lower body weight, fat weight, liver weight, fat ratio, food intake and energy intake. BO significantly reduced n-6/n-3 levels in plasma, liver and adipose tissues as well as serum triglycerides (TGs) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but contrarily increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Furthermore, HBO treatments decreased mRNA expression of lipid anabolism-related genes, lipid inflammatory-related genes, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and increased lipid catabolism-related genes as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma mRNA (PPARγ mRNA).

Meta-analyses of comparable studies were carried out. Thirteen studies (eight randomized controlled trials and five observational studies) met the eligibility criteria. Interventions were limited to silk (six studies), silver-coated cotton (five studies), borage oil, and ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) fiber (one study each). Silver textiles were associated with improvement in SCORAD (2 of 4), fewer symptoms, a lower need for rescue medication (1 of 2), no difference in quality of life, decreased Staphyloccosus aureus  (2 of 3), and improvement of trans-epidermal water loss (1 of 2), with no safety concerns.

It has been previously demonstrated that adipose-derived stem cells from obese (ob-ASCs), but not lean AT promote Th17 cells. Because n-3 PUFAs are known to inhibit obese AT , it is tested here whether they could inhibit ob-ASC-mediated IL-17A secretion.The n-3 PUFA precursor,  (ALA), or its derivatives, eicosapentaenoic, or docosahexaenoic , is added to co-cultures of human ob-ASCs and mononuclear cells (MNCs). All three inhibited IL-17A, but not IL-1β, IL-6, nor TNFα  secretion. As a control, palmitic  (PA), a saturated fatty , did not inhibit IL-17A secretion. ALA also inhibited IL-17A secretion mediated by adipocytes differentiated from ob-ASCs. Toll-like-receptor 4 is shown to be involved in ob-ASC-mediated-IL-17A secretion, and to be inhibited by ALA, together with Cyclo-Oxygenase-2 and Signal-Transducer-and-Activator-of-transcription-3. In addition, ALA down-regulated Intercellular-Adhesion-Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in both monocytes and ASCs, which resulted in decreased interactions between ob-ASCs and MNCs, and inhibition of IL-17A secretion.It is demonstrated herein that ALA inhibits Th17 cell promotion, through decreased ICAM-1expression in both ob-ASCs and monocytes.

A study using 8 multiparous (325 ± 17 DIM; mean ± SD) lactating Jersey cows was conducted to determine effects of feeding canola meal and lard versus extruded byproduct containing flaxseed as a high-C18:3  source on methane production and diet digestibility in late-lactation dairy cows. A crossover design with 32-d periods (28-d adaptation and 4-d collections) was used to compare 2 different  sources. Diets contained approximately 50% forage mixture of corn silage, alfalfa hay, and brome hay; the concentrate mixture changed between diets to include either (1) a conventional diet of corn, soybean meal, and canola meal with lard (control) or (2) a conventional diet of corn and soybean meal with an extruded byproduct containing flaxseed (EXF) as the  source. Diets were balanced to decrease corn, lard, and canola meal and replace them with soybean mean and EXF to increase the concentration of C18:3 (0.14 vs. 1.20% of DM). Methane production was measured using headbox-style indirect calorimeters. Cattle were restricted to 95% ad libitum feed intake during collections. Milk production (17.4 ± 1.04 kg/d) and dry matter intake (15.4 ± 0.71 kg/d) were similar among treatments. Milk  (5.88 ± 0.25%) and protein (4.08 ± 0.14%) were not affected by treatment. For methane production, no difference was observed for total production (352.0 vs. 349.8 ± 16.43 L/d for control vs. EXF, respectively). Methane production per unit of dry matter intake was not affected and averaged 23.1 ± 0.57 L/kg. Similarly, methane production per unit of energy-corrected milk was not affected by  source and averaged 15.5 ± 0.68 L/kg. Heat production was similar, averaging 21.1 ± 1.02 Mcal/d. Digestibility of organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and crude protein was not affected by diet and averaged 69.9, 53.6, and 73.3%, respectively. Results indicated that increasing C18:3 may not affect methane production or digestibility of the diet in lactating dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Recent studies have clarified the effects of EFA deficiency on membrane arachidonate and its metabolites, and have demonstrated that 20:3(n-9) (which accumulates in EFA deficiency) can be metabolized to a variety of eicosanoids. EFA deficiency has been shown to exert an anti-inflammatory effect. The mechanism of this effect may in part be mediated through a decrease in leukocyte leukotriene formation. In contrast, studies using the novel fatty acid, columbinic acid, have shown that the epidermal dysfunction seen in EFA deficiency may be a function of linoleate and its lipoxygenase metabolites rather than of arachidonate and the prostaglandins. Finally, it has recently been shown that EFA deficiency potentiates the effects of volatile anesthetics. EFA deficiency may thus provide a useful tool to investigate the molecular mechanism of these drugs.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16501443>[Lipids in enteral nutrition: does an optimal ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 exist?].</a></h2><p>The ratio between PUFA omega-6 and omega-3 is 3:1 in the unweaned, 5:1 in the young man, 5-10:1 in the adult. The PUFA omega-6 prevail over omega-3 because of elongation and desaturation processes. Linoleic  is the beginning of the omega-6 series, a- of the omega-3 series. Both acids give rise to PUFA which must be introduced with diet because the human race is not able to synthetize. They represent the 2-6% of total daily caloric intake and correspond about to 10 g every day according to LARN 1986-1987. During some diseases (after surgery, trauma, sepsis, etc.) their need increases until 25-50 g every day, so it is necessary a proper enteral nutrition (EN). For this reason the bromatological composition of diets for EN must respect the physiological ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 PUFA. The composition of 37 diets for EN was examined and it was found that 7 (18%) have a proper ratio between the two series of PUFA. Twenty-three (62%) do not signal any ratio, two have 6:1, two 4.5:1, in three the ratio is in favour of omega-3.

SCOs can be used as precursors for the synthesis of -based biofuels or employed as substitutes of expensive oils rarely found in the plant or animal kingdom. In the present review-article, aspects concerning SCOs (economics, biochemistry, substrates, technology, scale-up), with emphasis on the potential of Mortierella isabellina were presented. Fats and hydrophilic substrates have been used as carbon sources for cultivating Zygomycetes. Among them, wild-type M. isabellina strains have been reported as excellent SCO-producers, with conversion yields on sugar consumed and  in DCW values reported comparable to the maximum ones achieved for genetically engineered SCO-producing strains. Lipids produced on glucose contain γ- (GLA), a polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) of high dietary and pharmaceutical importance, though in low concentrations. Nevertheless, due to their abundance in oleic , these lipids are perfect precursors for the synthesis of 2nd generation biodiesel, while GLA can be recovered and directed to other usages. Genetic engineering focusing on over-expression of Δ6 and Δ12 desaturases and of C16 elongase may improve the fatty  composition (viz. increasing the concentration of GLA or other nutritionally important PUFAs) of these lipids.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28325998>Glucomannan- and glucomannan plus spirulina-enriched pork affect liver fatty  profile, LDL receptor expression and antioxidant status in Zucker fa/fa rats fed atherogenic diets.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the effects of glucomannan or glucomannan plus spirulina-restructured pork (RP) on liver fatty  profile, desaturase/elongase enzyme activities and oxidative status of Zucker fa/fa rats for seven weeks.

Increased  markers were found in C, G and GS rats. Cholesterol feeding increased liver size, fat, and cholesterol and reduced antioxidant enzyme levels and expressions. Cholesterolemia was lower in HG and HGS than in HC. GS vs. G showed higher stearic but lower oleic levels. SFA and PUFA decreased while MUFA increased by cholesterol feeding. The arachidonic/linoleic and docosahexaenoic/ ratios were lower in HC, HG, and HGS vs. C, G, and GS, respectively, suggesting a delta-6-elongase-desaturase system inhibition. Moreover, cholesterol feeding, mainly in HGS, decreased low-density-lipoprotein receptor expression and the delta-5-desaturase activity and increased the delta-9-desaturase activity. In conclusion, the liver production of highly unsaturated fatty acids was limited to decrease their oxidation in presence of hypercholesterolaemia. Glucomannan or glucomannan/spirulina-RP has added new attributes to their functional properties in meat, partially arresting the negative effects induced by high-fat-high-cholesterol feeding on the liver fatty  and antioxidant statuses.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26764053>LA and ALA prevent glucose intolerance in obese male rats without reducing reactive lipid content, but cause tissue-specific changes in fatty  composition.</a></h2><p>While the cause of Type 2 diabetes remains poorly defined, the accumulation of reactive lipids within white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver have been repeatedly implicated as underlying mechanisms. The ability of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to prevent the development of  has gained considerable interest in recent years; however, the mechanisms-of-action remain poorly described. Therefore, we determined the efficacy of diets supplemented with either linoleic  (LA) or α- (ALA) in preventing  and reactive lipid accumulation in key metabolic tissues of the obese Zucker rat. Obese Zucker rats displayed impaired glucose homeostasis and reduced n-3 and n-6 PUFA content in the liver and epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT). After the 12-wk feeding intervention, both LA- and ALA-supplemented diets prevented whole body glucose and  intolerance; however, ALA had a more pronounced effect. These changes occurred in association with n-3 and n-6 accumulation in all tissues studied, albeit to different extents (EWAT > liver > muscle). Triacylglycerol (TAG), diacylglycerol (DAG), ceramide, and sphingolipid accumulation were not attenuated in obese animals supplemented with either LA or ALA, suggesting that preservation of glucose homeostasis occurred independent of changes in reactive lipid content. However, PUFA-supplemented diets differentially altered the fatty  composition of TAGs, DAGs, and PLs in a tissue-specific manner, suggesting essential fatty  metabolism differs between tissues. Together, our results indicate that remodeling of the fatty  composition of various lipid fractions may contribute to the improved glucose tolerance observed in obese rats fed PUFA-supplemented diets.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191316>Dimethyl Sulfoxide Decreases Levels of Oxylipin Diols in Mouse Liver.</a></h2><p>Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is widely used as a solvent and cryopreservative in laboratories and considered to have many beneficial health effects in humans. Oxylipins are a class of biologically active metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that have been linked to a number of diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of DMSO on oxylipin levels in mouse liver. Liver tissue from male mice (C57Bl6/N) that were either untreated or injected with 1% DMSO at 18 weeks of age was analyzed for oxylipin levels using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). A decrease in oxylipin diols from linoleic  (LA, C18:2n6),  (ALA, C18:3n3) and docosahexeanoic  (DHA, C22:6n3) was observed 2 h after injection with DMSO. In contrast, DMSO had no effect on the epoxide precursors or other oxylipins including those derived from arachidonic  (C20:4n6) or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5n3). It also did not significantly affect the diol:epoxide ratio, suggesting a pathway distinct from, and potentially complementary to, soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHI). Since oxylipins have been associated with a wide array of pathological conditions, from arthritis pain to , our results suggest one potential mechanism underlying the apparent beneficial health effects of DMSO.

Samples of endometrium, obtained pre- and post-treatment, were incubated in vitro for 2 h and the prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha released into the medium measured by radioimmunoassay. The ability of the tissue to take up 14C-arachidonic  before and after treatment was also examined. Both GLA and EPA caused a marked decrease in the synthesis of prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha (P < 0.001) but under the experimental conditions used, there was no consistent effect on arachidonic  uptake. Body mass index, serum testosterone, fasting insulin and serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations did not change during the 6 month treatment period. An effect of GLA and EPA on arachidonic  uptake into endometrial tissue explants was demonstrated in vitro. In the presence of both GLA and EPA, uptake into phospholipids (particularly phosphatidylcholine) decreased while uptake into triglycerides increased. Free 14C-arachidonic  levels (that which could not be removed from the tissue by washing) also increased. Suppression of endometrial prostaglandin E2 and F2 alpha synthesis following GLA or EPA supplementation can be explained as direct competition between these fatty acids and arachidonic  (the precursor of 2-series prostaglandins) for incorporation into membrane phospholipids. The amount of arachidonic  available for 2-series prostaglandin synthesis will therefore be reduced. However, other mechanisms may exist which need to be investigated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21294872>The elicitation of a systemic resistance by Pseudomonas putida BTP1 in tomato involves the stimulation of two lipoxygenase isoforms.</a></h2><p>Some non-pathogenic rhizobacteria called Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) possess the capacity to induce in plant defense mechanisms effective against pathogens. Precedent studies showed the ability of Pseudomonas putida BTP1 to induce PGPR-mediated resistance, termed ISR (Induced Systemic Resistance), in different plant species. Despite extensive works, molecular defense mechanisms involved in ISR are less well understood that in the case of pathogen induced systemic acquired resistance.We analyzed the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and lipoxygenase (LOX), key enzymes of the phenylpropanoid and oxylipin pathways respectively, in tomato treated or not with P. putida BTP1. The bacterial treatment did not stimulate PAL activity and linoleate-consuming LOX activities. Linolenate-consuming LOX activity, on the contrary, was significantly stimulated in P. putida BTP1-inoculated plants before and two days after infection by B. cinerea. This stimulation is due to the increase of transcription level of two isoforms of LOX: TomLoxD and TomLoxF, a newly identified LOX gene. We showed that recombinant TomLOXF preferentially consumes  and produces 13-derivative of fatty acids. After challenging with B. cinerea, the increase of transcription of these two LOX genes and higher -consuming LOX activity were associated with a more rapid accumulation of free 13-hydroperoxy-octadecatrienoic and 13-hydroxy-octadecatrienoic acids, two antifungal oxylipins, in bacterized plants.In addition to the discovery of a new LOX gene in tomato, this work is the first to show differential induction of LOX isozymes and a more rapid accumulation of 13-hydroperoxy-octadecatrienoic and 13-hydroxy-octadecatrienoic acids in rhizobacteria mediated-induced systemic resistance.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27378407>Molecular cloning and functional characterization of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5), and its expression in response to the ratio of  to linoleic  in diets of large yellow croaker (Larmichthys crocea).</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to clone and functionally characterize a full-length cDNA encoding arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5) from large yellow croaker (Larmichthys crocea) and investigate its gene expression in response to graded dietary ratio of  (ALA) to linoleic  (LNA) (0.03, 0.06, 0.45, 0.90 and 1.51).

There was a small increase in overall protein levels when examined by Western blotting after treatment with GLA/Se/I when probed with Claudin-5 and Occludin. We report that GLA, I, and Se alone, or in combination are able to strengthen the function of TJs in human endothelial cells, by way of regulating the distribution of Claudin-5, Occludin, and ZO-1.

Thereby, the balance of oxidative metabolism is of importance in mast cell mediator synthesis and release. Fatty acids may modify mast cell function in several ways. In this study, we investigated the influence of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on oxidative parameters of a canine mastocytoma cell line. C2 cells were cultured in media supplemented with linoleic , arachidonic ,  and eicosapentaenoic , respectively. Production of reactive  species (ROS) as well as lipid peroxides was tested. Furthermore, stressor-induced DNA damage was measured. Exposure of the cells to PUFAs resulted in a significant increase in the synthesis of both ROS and lipid peroxides. Distinct differences between the PUFAs tested underline the impact of the unsaturation degree of fatty acids as well as the position of double bonds on mast cells.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10797850>Effect of methyl-prednisone and cyclosporine on the lipid pattern and polyunsaturated fatty  biosynthesis in the rat.</a></h2><p>The hyperlipidemia posttransplant has been largely attributed to immunosuppressant agents. In the present work we evaluated the effect of oral administration of cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) and/or methyl-prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) on lipid composition and polyunsaturated fatty  biosynthesis in normal adult male rats. The results obtained showed that both agents produced a delay on the growth together with a significant loss of body weight. In liver microsomal fraction from rats treated with methyl-prednisone, a depression in delta 6 and delta 5 desaturation activities, was observed. This effect was corroborated in the fatty  pattern through the enhancement of linoleic and dihomo-gamma- acids, and a depression of arachidonic . Similar results were noticed in those rats treated with both drugs when compared to the controls. No changes were observed either in the amount of liver microsomal total lipids or in the fatty  composition of kidney and testis microsomes, as well as in erythrocyte membranes, among the different groups studied. Cyclosporine alone produced a significant depression in plasma triglycerides and showed no modifications in the other lipid parameters studied compared to the controls. Fluorescence anisotropy measured in the different membranes was not modified by the several treatments used. In view of the aforementioned data, it can be stated that methyl-prednisone would be the responsible for many of the lipid disorders that can be observed in posttransplant patients when they are subjected to the combined  with cyclosporine.</p><p>Keyword:['immunotherapy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27307576>EPA prevents fat mass expansion and metabolic disturbances in mice fed with a Western diet.</a></h2><p>The impact of  (ALA), EPA, and DHA on  and metabolic complications was studied in mice fed a high-fat, high-sucrose (HF) diet. HF diets were supplemented with ALA, EPA, or DHA (1% w/w) and given to C57BL/6J mice for 16 weeks and to Ob/Ob mice for 6 weeks. In C57BL/6J mice, EPA reduced plasma cholesterol (-20%), limited fat mass accumulation (-23%) and adipose cell hypertrophy (-50%), and reduced plasma leptin concentration (-60%) compared with HF-fed mice. Furthermore, mice supplemented with EPA exhibited a higher insulin sensitivity (+24%) and glucose tolerance (+20%) compared with HF-fed mice. Similar effects were observed in EPA-supplemented Ob/Ob mice, although fat mass accumulation was not prevented. By contrast, in comparison with HF-fed mice, DHA did not prevent fat mass accumulation, increased plasma leptin concentration (+128%) in C57BL/6J mice, and did not improve glucose homeostasis in C57BL/6J and Ob/Ob mice. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, DHA stimulated leptin expression whereas EPA induced adiponectin expression, suggesting that improved leptin/adiponectin balance may contribute to the protective effect of EPA. In conclusion, supplementation with EPA, but not ALA and DHA, could preserve glucose homeostasis in an obesogenic environment and limit fat mass accumulation in the early stage of weight gain.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance', 'lipogenesis', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29315384>Induction of Stress Signaling In Vitro and Suppression of Gonadotropin Secretion by Free Fatty Acids in Female Mouse Gonadotropes.</a></h2><p>An emerging body of evidence supports the concept that the pituitary is a site for integration of multiple physiological and metabolic signals that inform and modulate endocrine pathways. Multiple endocrine mediators of energy balance and adiposity are known to impinge on the neuroendocrine axis regulating reproduction. Observations in humans show that obesity is correlated with decreased gonadotropin secretion, and studies have also suggested that pituitary sensitivity to stimulation by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is decreased in obese individuals. Free fatty acids are a potential mediator of adiposity and energy balance, but their impact as an endocrine modulator of pituitary function has not been closely examined. We evaluated the impact of free fatty acids on a pituitary gonadotrope cell line and in primary pituitary cultures of female mice. We show that increasing physiologically relevant doses of the monounsaturated ω-9 fatty  oleate induces cellular stress and increases production of reactive  species in a mouse gonadotrope cell line. In contrast, the unsaturated ω-3 α- and ω-6 linoleic fatty acids do not have this effect. Additionally, oleate can activate immediate-early gene expression independent of GnRH stimulation but has a negative impact on GnRH induction and expression of the gonadotropin subunit gene Lhb. Further, oleate suppresses gonadotropin secretion in response to pulsatile stimulation by GnRH. These results indicate that free fatty acids can directly alter gonadotropin gene expression and secretion in response to GnRH and may provide a link between energy sensing and reproduction.Copyright © 2018 Endocrine Society.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'obesity', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28128380>Effects of rosa mosqueta oil supplementation in lipogenic markers associated with prevention of liver steatosis.</a></h2><p>Rosa mosqueta (RM) oil is rich in α- (ALA) - a precursor of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and it has a high antioxidant activity due to its abundant content of tocopherols.

Low n-6 PUFA intakes enhance whereas high intakes decrease certain immune functions. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies for a role of AA metabolites in immune cell development and functions shows that they can limit or regulate cellular immune reactions and can induce deviation toward a T helper (Th)2-like immune response. In contrast to the effects of the oxidative metabolites of AA, the longer-chain n-6 PUFA produced by gamma- (18:3n-6, GLA) feeding decreases the Th2 cytokine and immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 antibody response. The n-6 PUFA, GLA, dihomo-gamma- (20:3n-6, DHLA) and AA, and certain oxidative metabolites of AA can also induce T-regulatory cell activity, e.g., transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-producing T cells; GLA feeding studies also demonstrate reduced proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production. Low intakes of long-chain n-3 fatty acids (fish oils) enhance certain immune functions, whereas high intakes are inhibitory on a wide range of functions, e.g., antigen presentation, adhesion molecule expression, Th1 and Th2 responses, proinflammatory cytokine and eicosanoid production, and they induce lymphocyte apoptosis. Vitamin E has a demonstrable critical role in long-chain n-3 PUFA interactions with immune functions, often reversing the effects of fish oil. The effect of dietary fatty acids on animal autoimmune disease models depends on both the autoimmune model and the amount and type of fatty acids fed. Diets low in fat, essential fatty  deficient (EFAD), or high in long-chain n-3 PUFA from fish oils increase survival and reduce disease severity in spontaneous autoantibody-mediated disease, whereas high-fat LA-rich diets increase disease severity. In experimentally induced T cell-mediated autoimmune disease, EFAD diets or diets supplemented with long-chain n-3 PUFA augment disease, whereas n-6 PUFA prevent or reduce the severity. In contrast, in both T cell- and antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, the desaturated/elongated metabolites of LA are protective. PUFA of both the n-6 and n-3 families are clinically useful in human autoimmune-inflammatory disorders, but the precise mechanisms by which these fatty acids exert their clinical effects are not well understood. Finally, the view that all n-6 PUFA are proinflammatory requires revision, in part, and their essential regulatory and developmental role in the immune system warrants appreciation.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27501823>The dietary effect of milk sphingomyelin on the lipid metabolism of obese/diabetic KK-A(y) mice and wild-type C57BL/6J mice.</a></h2><p>Purified milk sphingomyelin (SM) was obtained from lipid concentrated butter serum (LC-BS) by successive separations involving solvent fractionation, selective saponification, and silicic  column chromatography.

Overexpression of COX-2 has been found in a majority of breast carcinomas, and has also been associated with increased severity and the development of the metastasis. Our lab recently demonstrated that COX-2 can also metabolize dihomo-γ- (DGLA, a precursor of ω-6 arachidonic ) to produce an anti-cancer byproduct, 8-hydroxyoctanoic  (8-HOA) that can inhibit growth and migration of colon and pancreatic cancer cells. We thus tested whether our strategy of knocking down delta-5-desaturase (D5D, the key enzyme that converts DGLA to arachidonic ) in breast cancer cells overexpressing COX-2 can also be used to promote 8-HOA formation, thereby suppressing cancer growth, migration, and invasion.SiRNA and shRNA transfection were used to knock down D5D expression in MDA-MB 231 and 4 T1 cells (human and mouse breast cancer cell lines expressing high COX-2, respectively). Colony formation assay, FITC Annexin V/PI double staining, wound healing and transwell assay were used to assess the effect of our strategy on inhibition of cancer growth, migration, and invasion. GC/MS was used to measure endogenous 8-HOA, and western blotting was performed to evaluate the altered key protein expressions upon the treatments.We demonstrated that D5D knockdown licenses DGLA to inhibit growth of breast cancer cells via promoting formation of 8-HOA that can inhibit histone deacetylase and activate cell apoptotic proteins, such as procaspase 9 and PARP. Our strategy can also significantly inhibit cancer migration and invasion, associated with altered expression of MMP-2/- 9, E-cadherin, vimentin and snail. In addition, D5D knockdown and DGLA supplementation greatly enhanced the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil on breast cancer growth and migration.Consistent to our previous studies on colon and pancreatic cancer, here we demonstrate again that the high level of COX-2 in breast cancer cells can be capitalized on inhibiting cancer growth and migration.

Next, we used multivariable linear regression models that accounted for maternal education and parity, and child's age, sex and pubertal status, to examine associations of PUFA intake with the offspring outcomes. In models where BMI z-score was the outcome, we also adjusted for height z-score. We found that higher second trimester intake of EPA, DHA and AA were associated with lower offspring BMI and height z-score. For example, each 1-s.d. increment in second trimester EPA intake corresponded with 0.25 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.47) z-scores lower BMI and 0.20 (0.05, 0.36) z-scores lower height. Accounting for height z-score in models where BMI z-score was the outcome attenuated estimates [e.g., EPA: -0.16 (-0.37, 0.05)], suggesting that this relationship was driven by slower linear growth rather than excess adiposity. Maternal PUFA intake was not associated with the offspring metabolic biomarkers.

Oxiranyl carbinols such as (9S,10S,11S,12Z)-9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acids were the major EAS products. Besides, the CYP74C31 possessed an additional minor 9-AOS activity.

Raw milk from organic (>50% of dry matter intake from pasture) and conventional (no access to pasture) farms were adjusted to commercial whole and nonfat milk fat standards, and processed with or without homogenization, and with high-temperature-short-time or UHT pasteurization. The milk then underwent in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Comparison of milk from organic and conventional herds showed that the milks responded to processing in similar ways. General composition was the same among the whole milk samples and among the nonfat milk samples. Protein profiles were similar, with intact caseins and whey proteins predominant and only minor amounts of peptides. Whole milk samples from grazing cows contained higher levels of α- (C18:3), vaccenic (C18:1 trans), and conjugated linoleic , and lower levels of palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0)  than samples from nongrazing cows. Processing had no effect on conjugated linoleic  and  levels in milk, although homogenization resulted in higher levels of C8 to C14 saturated  . Of the 9  compounds evaluated, milk from grazing cows contained lower levels of 2-butanone than milk from nongrazing cows, and milk from both farms showed spikes for heptanal in UHT samples and spikes for butanoic, octanoic, nonanoic, and N-decanoic  in homogenized samples. At the start of in vitro digestion, nonfat raw and pasteurized milk samples formed the largest  clots, and organic milk clots were larger than conventional milk clots; UHT whole milk formed the smallest clots. Milk digests from grazing cows had lower levels of free   than digests from nongrazing cows. In vitro proteolysis was similar in milk from both farms and resulted in 85 to 95% digestibility. Overall, milk from organic/grass-fed and conventional herds responded in similar ways to typical homogenization and heat processing used in United States dairy plants and showed only minor differences in chemical traits and in vitro digestion. Findings from this research enhance our knowledge of the effect of processing on the quality traits and digestibility of milk from organic/pasture-fed and confined conventional herds and will help health-conscious consumers make informed decisions about dairy selections.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Flaxseed is one of the richest sources of n-3 PUFA  α- (ALA). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of flaxseed and ALA in models of skeletal muscle degeneration characterized by high levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF).The in vivo studies were carried out on dystrophic hamsters affected by muscle damage associated with high TNF plasma levels and fed with a long-term 30% flaxseed-supplemented diet. Differentiating C2C12 myoblasts treated with TNF and challenged with ALA represented the in vitro model. Skeletal muscle morphology was scrutinized by applying the Principal Component Analysis statistical method. Apoptosis,  and myogenesis were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Finally, an in silico analysis was carried out to predict the possible pathways underlying the effects of n-3 PUFAs.The flaxseed-enriched diet protected the dystrophic muscle from apoptosis and preserved muscle myogenesis by increasing the myogenin and alpha myosin heavy chain. Moreover, it restored the normal expression pattern of caveolin-3 thereby allowing protein retention at the sarcolemma. ALA reduced TNF-induced apoptosis in differentiating myoblasts and prevented the TNF-induced inhibition of myogenesis, as demonstrated by the increased expression of myogenin, myosin heavy chain and caveolin-3, while promoting myotube fusion. The in silico investigation revealed that FAK pathways may play a central role in the protective effects of ALA on myogenesis.These findings indicate that flaxseed may exert potent beneficial effects by preserving skeletal muscle regeneration and homeostasis partly through an ALA-mediated action. Thus, dietary flaxseed and ALA may serve as a useful strategy for treating patients with muscle dystrophies.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22261574>Dietary α--rich formula reduces adhesion molecules in rats with experimental .</a></h2><p>The ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty  therapy in inflammatory bowel disease is focused on the effects on fish oil-derived polyunsaturated fatty acids.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the transcriptional regulation and the influence of bovine ELOVL7 in bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that ELOVLs gene family had differential expression patterns in bMECs, and bovine ELOVL7 was expressed in a tissue-specific manner, which was high in kidney, followed by in abdominal fat and in bMECs. Promoter analysis of bovine ELOVL7, including bioinformatics analyzes, dual-luciferase reporter assays, protein pull-down assay, Western blot assay, over-expression and RNA interference assay, have independently and synthetically demonstrated that transcription factor Sp1 (SP1) specifically interacted with the GC-box at -143 to -128 base pair on ELOVL7 promoter. Furthermore, the exogenous α- (ALA, 18: 3n-3), strengthened the binding of SP1 to the ELOVL7 proximal promoter, resulting in the accumulation of lipid droplets in bMECs. In conclusion, these data suggest that the transcription of bovine ELOVL7 is affected by the binding of SP1 and the treatment of ALA, moreover, enlightening us the profound role of SP1 in modulating lipid synthesis of the mammary gland in cattle.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844257>Both linoleic and α- prevent  but have divergent impacts on skeletal muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics in obese Zucker rats.</a></h2><p>The therapeutic use of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in preserving  sensitivity has gained interest in recent decades; however, the roles of linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA) remain poorly understood. We investigated the efficacy of diets enriched with either LA or ALA on attenuating the development of  (IR) in obesity. Following a 12-wk intervention, LA and ALA both prevented the shift toward an IR phenotype and maintained muscle-specific  sensitivity otherwise lost in obese control animals. The beneficial effects of ALA were independent of changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity, as obese control and ALA-treated rats showed similar increases in these parameters. However, ALA increased the propensity for mitochondrial H2O2 emission and catalase content within whole muscle and reduced markers of oxidative stress (4-HNE and protein carbonylation). In contrast, LA prevented changes in markers of mitochondrial content, respiratory function, H2O2 emission, and oxidative stress in obese animals, thereby resembling levels seen in lean animals. Together, our data suggest that LA and ALA are efficacious in preventing IR but have divergent impacts on skeletal muscle mitochondrial content and function. Moreover, we propose that LA has value in preserving  sensitivity in the development of obesity, thereby challenging the classical view that n-6 PUFAs are detrimental.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22049297>Genetic variation in stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 is associated with  prevalence in Costa Rican adults.</a></h2><p>Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) activity, a key regulator of lipid metabolism, may be associated with the development of  (MetS).

The details of "unusual" e.g., hydroxyl or conjugated, fatty  formation remain elusive, because these enzymes await structural characterization. However, soluble plant acyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein) desaturases have been studied in far greater detail but typically only catalyze desaturation (dehydrogenation) reactions. We describe a mutant of the castor acyl-ACP desaturase (T117R/G188L/D280K) that converts stearoyl-ACP into the allylic alcohol trans-isomer (E)-10-18:1-9-OH via a cis isomer (Z)-9-18:1 intermediate. The use of regiospecifically deuterated substrates shows that the conversion of (Z)-9-18:1 substrate to (E)-10-18:1-9-OH product proceeds via hydrogen abstraction at C-11 and highly regioselective hydroxylation (>97%) at C-9. (18)O-labeling studies show that the hydroxyl  in the reaction product is exclusively derived from molecular . The mutant enzyme converts (E)-9-18:1-ACP into two major products, (Z)-10-18:1-9-OH and the conjugated  isomer, (E)-9-(Z)-11-18:2. The observed product profiles can be rationalized by differences in substrate binding as dictated by the curvature of substrate channel at the active site. That three amino  substitutions, remote from the diiron active site, expand the range of reaction outcomes to mimic some of those associated with the membrane-bound desaturase family underscores the latent potential of O(2)-dependent nonheme diiron enzymes to mediate a diversity of functionalization chemistry.

Mean RBC FA values across groups were compared using ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc test while controlling for age and gender (children); median dietary intake values were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Dietary intakes for total fat, saturated FAs and polyunsaturated FAs were higher in the two urban areas compared to the rural area. Total fat intake in rural-LP, and omega-3 FA dietary intake in all three areas were lower than the South African adopted guidelines.

Fatty acids may contribute by acting as precursors of signalling molecules or by direct activity on receptors. The medium- and long-chain NEFA receptor FFA1 (free fatty acid receptor 1, previously known as GPR40) has been linked to enhancement of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas FFA4 (free fatty acid receptor 4, previously known as GPR120) has been associated with insulin-sensitising and anti-inflammatory effects, and both receptors are reported to protect pancreatic islets and promote secretion of appetite and glucose-regulating hormones. Hypothesising that FFA1 and FFA4 mediate therapeutic effects of dietary components, we screened a broad selection of NEFA on FFA1 and FFA4 and characterised active compounds in concentration-response curves.

For α- (ALA), it was 0.21 ± 0.09% in dialysis patients versus 0.33 ± 0.11% in the control group (p < .001). For eicosapentanoic  (EPA), 0.59 ± 0.23% versus 1.15 ± 0.87% (p < .001), and for docosahexaenoic  (DHA) 1.11 ± 0.50% versus 1.75 ± 0.87% (p < .001), respectively. The amount of n-3 PUFA decreased with time on dialysis and it correlated positively with body fat mass. For DHA, this correlation was r = .48 (p < .01) and for EPA r = .40 (p < .05). Patients with CKD have a relatively low content of n-3 PUFA which may contribute to their high cardiovascular risk.

Effect of carotenoid structure and oxygen partial pressure on antioxidative activity.</a></h2><p>Carotenoid scavenging of free radicals has been investigated in peroxidizing methyl esters of unsaturated fatty acids using (i) metmyoglobin as a water-based free-radical initiator in a heterogeneous /water system, and (ii) azo-bis-isobutyronitrile as a free-radical initiator in a homogeneous chloroform solution. For the heterogeneous system, using a combination of electrochemical oxygen depletion measurements, spectrophotometric determination of  hydroperoxides and carotenoid degradation, it was demonstrated that each of the four carotenoids astaxanthin, beta-carotene, canthaxanthin, and zeaxanthin protects the methyl esters against oxidation. The antioxidative effect increases with increasing carotenoid concentration, increases with decreasing oxygen partial pressure (0.010 < pO2 < 0.50 atm), and shows little dependence on the structure of the carotenoid. For a homogeneous solution, the effect of the structure of the carotenoid was further investigated, and it was shown that the stability of the four carotenoids in the oxidizing system are different, with the order of decreasing stability being: astaxanthin > canthaxanthin > beta-carotene > zeaxanthin. Each of the four carotenoids can suppress  oxidation and the degree of suppression of peroxidation of methyl linoleate corresponds to the difference in stability.</p><p>Keyword:[' methyl esterfat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8827697>The ratio of n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the rat diet alters serum lipid levels and lymphocyte functions.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have reported that feeding rats diets rich in fish oils, which contain high proportions of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, results in lowering of blood lipid levels and suppression of lymphocyte functions tested ex vivo and in vivo. The effects of other n-3 PUFA, such as , which is found in high proportions in linseed oil, are not as well documented. Therefore, in the present study, weanling male rats were fed for six weeks on one of five high-fat (20% by weight) diets made by mixing together sunflower and linseed oils; the resulting blends had n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios of 112.5:1 (pure sunflower oil), 14.8:1, 6.5:1, 0.81:1, and 0.33:1 (pure linseed oil); the levels of all other components in the diet were identical. The final body weight and total dissectable fat were lowest in rats fed the pure linseed oil diet. Serum cholesterol, triacylglycerol and nonesterified fatty  concentrations decreased as the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio of the diet decreased. The fatty  composition of the serum and of spleen lymphocytes was influenced by the diet fed-there was a progressive decrease in the proportions of linoleic and arachidonic acids and a progressive increase in the proportion of  as the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio of the diet decreased.

We therefore compared the effects of select lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins produced from α- (ALA, C18:3 n-3), linoleic  (LA, C18:2 n-6), and arachidonic  (AA, C20:4 n-6) on key adipocyte functions that are altered in . Individual oxylipins were added to the culture medium of differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes for 6days. Lipid accumulation was subsequently determined by Oil Red O staining, while Western blotting was used to measure levels of proteins associated with lipid metabolism and characteristics of adipocyte functionality. Addition of all oxylipins at 30nM was sufficient to significantly decrease triglyceride accumulation in lipid droplets, and higher levels completely blocked lipid production. Our results establish that lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins produced from 18-carbon PUFA differentially affect multiple adipocyte processes associated with lipid storage and adipokine production. However, these effects are not due to the oxylipins blocking adipocyte maturation and thus globally suppressing all adipocyte characteristics. Furthermore, these oxylipin species decrease the lipid content of adipocytes regardless from which precursor fatty  or lipoxygenase they were derived. Consequently, adipocyte characteristics can be altered through the ability of oxylipins to selectively modulate levels of proteins involved in both lipid metabolism and adipokine production.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, punicic  (PA), a major bioactive found in pomegranate seed, was subjected for biological characterization with respect to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist property in an in vitro system (3T3-L1 adipocytes). We evaluated the adipogenic potential of various concentrations (5, 10 and 30 μM) of PA by studying triglyceride accumulation and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity in adipocytes, which were found to be increased moderately compared with the positive control, i.e. rosiglitazone (RG). Glucose uptake activity (↑225.93% ± 2.55% for 30 μM of PA), and the prevention of reactive  species (ROS) generation (↓57 ± 1.83% for 30 μM of PA) in adipocytes with PA were also evaluated. We also found that PA increased adiponectin secretion and upregulated GLUT4 expression and translocation in adipocytes. Molecular modelling studies revealed a high binding affinity of PA to the PPARγ ligand binding domain. An in vitro ligand binding assay based on time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) also proved PA as a PPARγ agonist.

However, an unbiased transcriptome sequencing analysis of CMS in cotton is currently lacking in the literature. This study compared differentially expressed (DE) genes of floral buds at the sporogenous cells stage (SS) and microsporocyte stage (MS) (the two most important stages for pollen abortion in JA-CMS) between JA-CMS and its fertile maintainer line JB cotton plants, using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing platform. A total of 709 (1.8%) DE genes including 293 up-regulated and 416 down-regulated genes were identified in JA-CMS line comparing with its maintainer line at the SS stage, and 644 (1.6%) DE genes with 263 up-regulated and 381 down-regulated genes were detected at the MS stage. By comparing the two stages in the same material, there were 8 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated DE genes in JA-CMS line and 29 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated DE genes in JB maintainer line at the MS stage. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate 7 randomly selected DE genes. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that genes involved in reduction-oxidation reactions and  metabolism were down-regulated, while genes pertaining to photosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis were up-regulated in JA-CMS floral buds compared with their JB counterparts at the SS and/or MS stages. All these four biological processes play important roles in reactive  species (ROS) homeostasis, which may be an important factor contributing to the sterile trait of JA-CMS.

Defatted FSM produced a significant increase in long chain fatty acids, which included eicosadienoic  (C20:2) in PEC and C22:6 in serum. PEC from rats fed 10.0% FS produced significantly less (about 50%) O2- in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), than did PEC from control animals; dietary treatment had no effect on O2- in response to LM. FSM had no impact on the O2- production by PEC in response to PMA or LM. Antilisterial activity of PEC was determined by comparing bacterial uptake after 1 hr with recovery 24 hrs later. Despite comparably equivalent bacterial uptake, few viable intracellular LM were recovered at T = 24 for all test samples, indicating that, regardless of the dietary treatment, PEC were able to handle the in vitro LM infection.

Significant negative association of plasma AA was found with plasma LA and ALA and significant positive association with serum ferritin. Plasma DHA associated, negatively with plasma LA and ALA. We showed that in a population with low intakes of LA and ALA, the proportions of phospholipid LA and ALA determines the relative proportions of AA and DHA and low iron status probably attenuates the conversion of LA to AA.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our earlier studies have demonstrated that vitamin B12 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are interlinked in the one carbon cycle. The present study for the first time examines the effect of maternal n-3 PUFA supplementation to vitamin B12 deficient or supplemented diets on pregnancy outcome, fatty- status and  variables in Wistar rats. Pregnant dams were assigned to one of the following groups: control, vitamin B12 deficient, vitamin B12 supplemented, vitamin B12 deficient + n-3 PUFA or vitamin B12 supplemented + n-3 PUFA. The amount of vitamin B12 in the supplemented group was 0.50 μg kg(-1) diet and n-3 PUFA was  (ALA) 1.68, eicosapentaenoic  5.64, docosahexaenoic  (DHA) 3.15 (g per 100g fatty acids per kg diet). Our findings indicate that maternal vitamin B12 supplementation did not affect the weight gain of dams during pregnancy but reduced litter size and weight and was ameliorated by n-3 PUFA supplementation. Vitamin B12 deficiency or supplementation resulted in a low percentage distribution of plasma arachidonic  and DHA. n-3 PUFA supplementation to these diets improved the fatty- status. Vitamin B12 deficiency resulted in higher homocysteine and insulin levels, which were normalised by supplementation with either vitamin B12 or n-3 PUFA.

It has been implicated that various fatty acids exert different effects on food intake and body weight. However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of linoleic  (LA) and stearic  (SA) on agouti-related protein (AgRP) expression and secretion in immortalized mouse hypothalamic N38 cells and to explore the likely underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that LA inhibited, while SA stimulated AgRP expression and secretion of N38 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, LA suppressed the protein expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), phosphorylation levels of JNK and IKKα/β, suggesting the inhibition of TLR4-dependent inflammation pathway. However, the above mentioned inhibitory effects of LA were eliminated by TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In contrast, SA promoted TLR4 protein expression and activated TLR4-dependent inflammation pathway, with elevated ratio of p-JNK/JNK. While TLR4 siRNA reversed the stimulatory effects of SA on AgRP expression and TLR4-dependent inflammation. Moreover, we found that TLR4 was also involved in LA-enhanced and SA-impaired leptin/insulin signal pathways in N38 cells. In conclusion, our findings indicated that LA elicited inhibitory while SA exerted stimulatory effects on AgRP expression and secretion via TLR4-dependent inflammation and leptin/insulin pathways in N38 cells.

This study aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of LR on mice with CCl-induced acute liver injury through conventional assays and metabolomics analysis. This study consisted of male mice ( = 23) in four groups (i.e., control, model, positive control, and LR). The extract of whole plant of LR was used to treat mice in the LR group. Biochemical and histological assays (i.e., serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), and histological changes of liver tissue) were used to evaluate LR efficacy, and metabolomics analysis based on GC-MS and LC-MS was conducted to reveal metabolic changes. The conventional analysis and metabolomic profiles both suggested that LR treatment could protect mice against CCl-induced acute liver injury. The affected metabolic pathways included linoleic  metabolism, α- metabolism, arachidonic  metabolism, CoA biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, the TCA cycle, and purine metabolism. This study identified eight metabolites, including phosphopantothenic , succinic , AMP, choline, glycerol 3-phosphate, linoleic , arachidonic , and DHA, as potential biomarkers for evaluating hepatoprotective effect of LR.

Intolerance to acetylsalicylic  is connected to the intake of
some drugs and food containing salicylic . People suffering
from this intolerance have to follow an elimination diet limiting
the intake of salicylates.
The elimination diet can lead to deficiencies in nutrients, and
therefore we decided to test whether a low salicylate diet of various
calorie content (1500, 2000, 2500 kcal) can pose such a risk.Research material consisted of 30 diets
(10 for each calorie content), prepared using nutrition software
Dieta 5, recommended by the National Food and Nutrition Institute
in Poland. Average nutrients’ contents were calculated and
compared to current dietary standards for adults.A low salicylate diet supplying 1500 kcal is, both
for males and females, the most deficient diet with respect
to nutrients’ contents. In the case of women aged 19–30 insufficient
intake can relate to such nutrients as: potassium, calcium,
iodine, vitamin D, dietary fibre and . In women
aged 31–65 it can additionally lead to magnesium deficiencies.
In men aged 19–65 a low salicylate diet providing 1500 kcal may
not cover daily requirements for nine nutrients: besides those
mentioned above, also vitamins E and C. However, low salicylate
2000 kcal and 2500 kcal diets do not pose a greater risk with
respect to nutrient deficiencies.Long-term use of a low salicylic 1500 kcal diet poses
the greatest threat of nutrient deficiencies. Along with increasing
the calorie content in a diet, the number of deficient nutrients
decreases, but too high an  intake may lead to subjects
becoming overweight or obese. A low salicylate and low caloric
diet requires consideration of additional supplementation.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804909>Familial chylomicronemia syndrome: Bringing to life dietary recommendations throughout the life span.</a></h2><p>Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with loss of function mutations of lipoprotein lipase resulting in hypertriglyceridemia and accumulation of chylomicrons in plasma, often leading to acute pancreatitis.

Objectively measured plasma PUFAs can help to clarify these associations.Plasma phospholipid PUFAs were measured by gas chromatography among 12,132 incident T2D cases and 15,919 subcohort participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct study across eight European countries. Country-specific hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Prentice-weighted Cox regression and pooled by random-effects meta-analysis. We also systematically reviewed published prospective studies on circulating PUFAs and T2D risk and pooled the quantitative evidence for comparison with results from EPIC-InterAct. In EPIC-InterAct, among long-chain n-3 PUFAs, α- (ALA) was inversely associated with T2D (HR per standard deviation [SD] 0.93; 95% CI 0.88-0.98), but eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were not significantly associated.

These findings from EPIC-InterAct were broadly similar to comparative findings from summary estimates from up to nine studies including between 71 to 2,499 T2D cases. Limitations included potential residual confounding and the inability to distinguish between dietary and metabolic influences on plasma phospholipid PUFAs.These large-scale findings suggest an important inverse association of circulating plant-origin n-3 PUFA (ALA) but no convincing association of marine-derived n3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) with T2D. Moreover, they highlight that the most abundant n6-PUFA (LA) is inversely associated with T2D.

Addition of GLA in vitro suppresses release of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) from human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS-induced IL-1beta release is followed by IL-1-induced IL-1beta release, an amplification process termed "autoinduction." We show here, using IL-1alpha stimulation to simulate autoinduction, that administration of GLA to healthy volunteers and to patients with inflammatory arthritis reduces LPS-induced IL-1beta secretion mainly by reducing autoinduction of IL-1beta. GLA reduces LPS-induced pro-IL-1beta mRNA modestly and IL-la-induced pro-IL-1beta gene expression markedly. In addition to reducing amplification of IL-1beta, GLA increases the amount of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) secreted from stimulated cells, thereby facilitating an increase in the secreted IL-1Ra/IL-1beta ratio. IL-1beta is important to host defense, but the amplification mechanism may be excessive in genetically predisposed individuals.

Docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6ω-3) was lower and arachidonic  (AA, C20:4ω-6) and ω6/ω3-PUFAs were higher in CAD patients than in controls. ω3-PUFAs were significantly lower in CAD patients, particularly those with MetS than in healthy controls. Multiple regression analysis revealed that AA and DHA among serum FAs were mainly associated with the cardiometabolic risk (β'-coefficients for AA:0.336; DHA: -0.296) together with age, MetS factors, LA, DGLA and gender (r=0.529, p<0.001). Under LPS-induced stress condition, LA and DHA significantly suppressed VSMC proliferation. DHA also up-regulated the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK, and dramatically inhibited nuclear translocation of NF-κB-p65 in VSMCs.AA and DHA were mainly associated with cardiometabolic risk. Particularly, DHA may be effective on suppression of vascular proliferation and inflammation.Copyright © 2014 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Dihomo-GLA (DGLA) is synthesized directly from GLA and forms a substrate for cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, resulting in the synthesis of lipid mediators (eicosanoids). In the present study, the immunomodulatory effects of DGLA were investigated and compared with those of other relevant fatty acids. Freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured in fatty  (100 microm)-enriched medium for 48 hr. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 20 hr and the cytokine levels were measured, in supernatants, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Phospholipids were analysed by gas chromatography. Fatty acids were readily taken up, metabolized and incorporated into cellular phospholipids. Compared with the other fatty acids tested, DGLA exerted pronounced modulatory effects on cytokine production. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-10 levels were reduced to 60% of control levels, whereas IL-6 levels were not affected by DGLA. Kinetic studies showed that peak levels of TNF-alpha, occurring early after LPS addition, were inhibited strongly, whereas IL-10 levels were not affected until 15 hr after stimulation. Both the reduction of cytokine levels and the decrease in arachidonic  levels in these cells, induced by DGLA, were dose dependent, suggesting a shift in eicosanoid-subtype synthesis. However, although some DGLA-derived eicosanoids similarly reduced TNF-alpha levels, the effects of DGLA were probably not mediated by COX products, as the addition of indomethacin did not alter the effects of DGLA. In conclusion, these results suggest that DGLA affects cytokine production by human PBMC independently of COX activation.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30594358>The effect of oak tannin (Quercus robur) and hops (Humulus lupulus) on dietary nitrogen efficiency, methane emission, and milk fatty  composition of dairy cows fed a low-protein diet including linseed.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to test the effects of inclusion of hop pellets (HP) and oak tannin extracts (OT) alone or in combination on N efficiency, methane (CH) emission, and milk production and composition in 2 experiments with dairy cows fed low-N rations supplemented with linseed. In both experiments, 6 lactating Holstein cows were assigned to 3 dietary treatments in a 3 × 3 duplicated Latin square design (21-d periods). Cows were fed a total mixed ration at a restricted level to meet their nutrient requirements. In experiment 1, 169 g dry matter (DM) of OT or 56 g DM of HP was included separately in the control diet (C1). In experiment 2, the additives were included together (OT-HP) in the control diet (C2) similar to C1. Diet C2 was compared with a control without linseed (C0). In experiment 1, the supplementation of the control diet with OT decreased urinary N excretion by 12%. In experiment 2, the combination of OT and HP decreased urinary N by 7%. Oak tannin extracts and HP alone or in combination did not influence the daily enteric CH production of cows. Cows fed diet C0 produced 17% more enteric CH daily than those fed diet C2. Intake of diet C2, which contained 6.7% extruded linseed on a DM basis (experiment 2), decreased the sum of 6:0 to 14:0 fatty acids (-16%) and palmitic  (-26%) and increased the stearic  (+50%), oleic  (+36%), vaccenic  (trans-11 18:1; +285%), rumenic  (cis-9,trans-11 18:2; +235%), and α- (+100%) in milk . The supplementation of diet C2 with the OT-HP mixture further improved the milk's fatty  composition. Intake of the OT alone increased α- by 17.7% (experiment 1). The results of this study show that at the economically acceptable dose we tested, hops had no effect on urinary N excretion, CH emission, milk production, and milk composition. By contrast, supplementation of diets with oak tannin extract can be considered for reducing urinary N excretion. The combination of oak tannin and hops had no more effect than oak tannin alone except on the milk fatty  profile, which was favorably influenced from a nutritional point of view.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

There was assessment, therefore, of the capacity of individual fatty acids bound to fatty  free BSA to improve sperm survival at 6 °C because oxidative stress and lipid degradation are prominent detrimental factors. Different effects of the fatty acids were observed. Supplementation with naturally occurring fatty acids (, linoleic, oleic, palmitoleic ), which may become metabolically incorporated into sperm lipids, increased the number of motile and progressively motile sperm after 2 days of storage during a thermo-resistance test (5 h at 38 °C) to that of control samples preserved at 17 °C in pure Beltsville Thawing Solution. With the exception of , all naturally occurring fatty acids enhanced the number of sperm with active  after 3 days of storage. Palmitoleic  was the most effective supplement with effects already present when sperm were re-warmed for 30 min after 2 and 7 days of storage. The non-endogenous, non-integrated timnodonic  (20:5) had no effect on sperm variables. Because the application of individual fatty acids attached to BSA had differing effects in preserving boar sperm at 6 °C, the use of combinations of fatty acids could be more efficacious than with use of natural lipid supplements for low temperature preservation of sperm.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have attracted attention in the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry, their role in eating disorders remains unknown. This meta-analysis investigates the differences of PUFA levels between patients with eating disorders and healthy controls, and the potentially beneficial effects of PUFAs in such patients.We conducted a systematic literature search and meta-analysis under the random effects model.Eleven studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Compared with controls, 379 patients with eating disorders had significantly higher plasma levels of , eicosapentaenoic , stearidonic , osbond , palmitoleic , oleic , and total omega-3 fatty acids; and lower levels of total omega-6 fatty acids and omega-6/omega-3 ratio. Eating disorders were associated with significantly higher red blood cell membrane levels of palmitoleic  and oleic  and lower levels of adrenic , arachidonic , and total omega-6 fatty acids. In addition, PUFA supplements were associated with a benefit to body weight outcomes but not disease severity and mood symptoms in interventional trials.This meta-analysis indicates abnormal levels of PUFAs in peripheral blood tissues in patients with eating disorders. The relationship between PUFAs and eating disorders should be interpreted cautiously considering the specific  under starvation state.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of α-ESA on hepatic lipid metabolism. Using H4IIEC3 hepatoma cell line, we showed that α-ESA significantly lowered intracellular triglyceride accumulation compared to α- (LN), used as a fatty  control, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The effects of α-ESA on enzyme activities and mRNA profiles in H4IIEC3 cells suggested that enhanced fatty  oxidation and lowered  were involved in α-ESA-mediated triglyceride lowering effects. In addition, α-ESA triggered AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation without altering sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein levels. When cells were treated with vehicle control (VC), LN alone (LN; 100μmol/L) or in combination with α-ESA (LN+α-ESA; 75+25μmol/L) for 24h, acetylation of forkhead box protein O1 was decreased, while the NAD(+)/NADH ratio, mRNA levels of NAMPT and PTGR1 and enzyme activity of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase were increased by LN+α-ESA treatment compared to treatment with LN alone, suggesting that α-ESA activates SIRT1 by increasing NAD(+) synthesis and NAD(P)H consumption. The antisteatosis effect of α-ESA was confirmed in mice treated with a high-sucrose diet supplemented with 1% α-ESA for 5weeks. We conclude that α-ESA favorably affects hepatic lipid metabolism by increasing cellular NAD(+)/NADH ratio and activating PPARα, AMPK and SIRT1 signaling pathways.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, we utilized the Δ6-desaturase model, wherein knockout mice (D6KO) lack the Fads2 gene encoding for the rate-limiting enzyme that initiates FA metabolism, thereby providing a model to determine specific FA immunomodulatory effects. Wild-type (WT) and D6KO mice were fed one of four isocaloric diets differing in FA source (9weeks): corn oil (LA-enriched), arachidonic  single cell oil (AA-enriched), flaxseed oil (ALA-enriched) or menhaden fish oil (EPA/DHA-enriched). Splenic mononuclear cell cytokine production in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), T-cell receptor (TCR) and anti-CD40 stimulation was determined. Following LPS stimulation, AA was more bioactive compared to LA, by increasing inflammatory cytokine production of IL-6 (1.2-fold) and TNFα (1.3-fold). Further, LPS-stimulated IFNγ production in LA-fed D6KO mice was reduced 5-fold compared to LA-fed WT mice, indicating that conversion of LA to AA was necessary for cytokine production. Conversely, ALA exerted an independent immunomodulatory effect from EPA/DHA and all n-3 FA increased LPS-stimulated IL-10 production versus LA and AA.

Several trials have evaluated the effects of pharmaconutrients, given as part of a feeding formula or as a nutritional supplement, on clinical outcomes in critical illness and ARDS.To systematically review and critically appraise available evidence on the effects of immunonutrition compared to standard non-immunonutrition formula feeding on mechanically ventilated adults (aged 18 years or older) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, conference proceedings, and trial registries for appropriate studies up to 25 April 2018. We checked the references from published studies and reviews on this topic for potentially eligible studies.We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing immunonutrition versus a control or placebo nutritional formula in adults (aged 18 years or older) with ARDS, as defined by the Berlin definition of ARDS or, for older studies, by the American-European Consensus Criteria for both ARDS and acute lung injury.Two review authors independently assessed the quality of studies and extracted data from the included trials. We sought additional information from study authors. We performed statistical analysis according to Cochrane methodological standards. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, ventilator days, indices of oxygenation, cardiac adverse events, gastrointestinal adverse events, and total number of adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.We identified 10 randomized controlled trials with 1015 participants. All studies compared an enteral formula or additional supplemental omega-3 fatty acids (i.e. eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA)), gamma- (GLA), and antioxidants. We assessed some of the included studies as having high risk of bias due to methodological shortcomings. Studies were heterogenous in nature and varied in several ways, including type and duration of interventions given, calorific targets, and reported outcomes. All studies reported mortality. For the primary outcome, study authors reported no differences in all-cause mortality (longest period reported) with the use of an immunonutrition enteral formula or additional supplements of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants (risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.07; participants = 1015; studies = 10; low-quality evidence).For secondary outcomes, we are uncertain whether immunonutrition with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants reduces ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD) -3.09 days. 95% CI -5.19 to -0.99; participants = 639; studies = 8; very low-quality evidence) and ventilator days (MD -2.24 days, 95% CI -3.77 to -0.71; participants = 581; studies = 7; very low-quality evidence). We are also uncertain whether omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants improve oxygenation, defined as ratio of partial pressure of arterial  (PaO₂) to fraction of inspired  (FiO₂), at day 4 (MD 39 mmHg, 95% CI 10.75 to 67.02; participants = 676; studies = 8), or whether they increase adverse events such as cardiac events (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.09 to 8.46; participants = 339; studies = 3; very low-quality evidence), gastrointestinal events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.75; participants = 427; studies = 4; very low-quality evidence), or total adverse events (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.23; participants = 517; studies = 5; very low-quality evidence).This meta-analysis of 10 studies of varying quality examined effects of omega-3 fatty acids and/or antioxidants in adults with ARDS. This intervention may produce little or no difference in all-cause mortality between groups. We are uncertain whether immunonutrition with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants improves the duration of ventilator days and ICU length of stay or oxygenation at day 4 due to the very low quality of evidence. Adverse events associated with immunonutrition are also uncertain, as confidence intervals include the potential for increased cardiac, gastrointestinal, and total adverse events.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25934114>Lowering the dietary omega-6: omega-3 does not hinder nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease development in a murine model.</a></h2><p>It is hypothesized that a high dietary n-6:n-3 (eg, 10-20:1) is partly responsible for the rise in obesity and related health ailments. However, no tightly controlled studies using high-fat diets differing in the n-6:n-3 have tested this hypothesis. The aim of the study was to determine the role that the dietary n-6:n-3 plays in non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease (NAFLD) and colitis development. We hypothesized that reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 would hinder the development of NAFLD and colitis. Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed high-fat diets, differing in the n-6:n-3 (1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1), for 20 weeks. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the hepatic phospholipid arachidonic  (AA):eicosapentaenoic  and AA:docosahexaenoic . Hepatic metabolism, inflammatory signaling, macrophage polarization, gene expression of inflammatory mediators, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and oxidative capacity were assessed as well as colonic inflammatory signaling, and gene expression of inflammatory mediators and  proteins. Although reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 lowered the hepatic phospholipid AA:eicosapentaenoic  and AA:docosahexaenoic  in a dose-dependent manner and mildly influenced inflammatory signaling, it did not significantly attenuate NAFLD development. Furthermore, the onset of NAFLD was not paired to colitis development or changes in  protein gene expression. In conclusion, reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 did not attenuate NAFLD progression; nor is it likely that colitis, or gut permeability, plays a role in NAFLD initiation in this model.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we demonstrate alpha-ESA induced apoptosis and autophagy with reactive  species (ROS) generation in HeLa cells. Treatment with alpha-ESA caused inhibition of phosphorylated (p)AKT and elongated the sub G1 phase in the cell cycle, indicating induction of apoptosis. Autophagy was also induced by alpha-ESA treatment, causing low pAKT and pP70S6K activities, increasing pERK1/2 and leading to a higher conversion rate of LC3 I to LC3 II compared to that of the control. The autophagy was further confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry through monodansylcadavarine (MDC) staining. It appears that the role of autophagy is a protective mechanism against cell death in alpha-ESA-treated HeLa cells. Subsequently, we found that treating HeLa cells with alpha-ESA induced the generation of reactive  species (ROS). The phosphorylation of P70S6K, downstream of mTOR signaling, and AKT were further reduced by pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, whereas the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II were further enhanced. As a result, the blocking of the action of ROS promoted alpha-ESA-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Taken together, our results indicate that the generation of ROS by alpha-ESA treatment impedes the progress of apoptosis and excessive autophagy formation which takes part in cell death, thus impeding death promotion.Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A randomised clinical trial.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of evening primrose oil (EvPO) on the duration of pregnancy and labour. The study was performed as a triple blind placebo controlled randomised clinical trial on nulliparous low-risk women with a certain gestational age of 40 weeks of pregnancy and a Bishop score of less than 4. In the case group (EvPO group), EvPO capsules were administered, 1000 mg, twice daily, for 7 days, and in the control group, placebo was administered similarly. The women of the two groups were followed up to delivery. In total, 80 women finished the study (40 in each group). The women of the two groups did not have significant differences according to age, BMI, Bishop Score at the beginning of the study, gestational age at entering the study, employment status and education level, the number of capsules used and duration of using medications. There was no significant difference between the two groups according to gestational age at delivery, need for induction or augmentation of labour, duration of different stages of labour, neonatal weight and Apgar scores, and the indications for hospital admission. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Evening primrose oil has been used for the treatment of systemic disorders, which are accompanied with chronic inflammation such as atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and . Also, it has been proposed for some women's health conditions including breast pain (mastalgia), symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and menopausal symptoms, cervical ripening and induction or augmentation of labour. What do the results of this study add? Evening primrose oil does not have any impact on Bishop Score and the duration of different stages of labour. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? According to the present study and the other performed studies, there is not enough evidence confirming effectiveness of Evening primrose oil for cervical ripening and duration of labour. It is suggested that pending further data its usage should be limited to experimental RCTs and its use in clinical practice should be prevented. Also, different routes of administration and different dosages should be investigated.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'psoriasis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972532>PNPLA3 variant I148M is associated with altered hepatic lipid composition in humans.</a></h2><p>The common sequence variant I148M of the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 gene (PNPLA3) is associated with increased hepatic triacylglycerol (TAG) content, but not with , in humans.

PNPLA3 (I148M) minor allele carriers had an increased n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) α- content and reductions in several n-6 PUFAs in the liver TAG fraction. Furthermore, there was a strong inverse correlation between n-6 PUFA and TAG content independent of PNPLA3 genotype. In a multivariate model including liver fat content, PNPLA3 genotype and fatty  composition, two significant differences could be exclusively attributed to the PNPLA3 (I148M) minor allele: reduced stearic  and increased α- content in the hepatic TAG fraction.These changes therefore suggest a mechanism to explain the PNPLA3 (I148M)-dependent increase in liver fat content without causing .

Since n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), specifically docosahexaenoic  (DHA), alter EGFR signaling and suppress downstream activation of key signaling pathways, we hypothesized that DHA would be detrimental to the process of intestinal wound healing. Using a mouse immortalized colonocyte model, DHA uniquely reduced EGFR ligand-induced receptor activation, whereas DHA and its metabolic precursor eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) reduced wound-induced EGFR transactivation compared with control (no fatty  or linoleic ). Under wounding conditions, the suppression of EGFR activation was associated with a reduction in downstream activation of cytoskeletal remodeling proteins (PLCγ1, Rac1, and Cdc42). Subsequently, DHA and EPA reduced cell migration in response to wounding. Mice were fed a corn oil-, DHA-, or EPA-enriched diet prior to intestinal wounding (2.5% dextran sodium sulfate for 5 days followed by termination after 0, 3, or 6 days of recovery). Mortality was increased in EPA-fed mice and colonic histological injury scores were increased in EPA- and DHA-fed mice compared with corn oil-fed (control) mice. Although kinetics of colonic EGFR activation and downstream signaling (PLCγ1, Rac1, and Cdc42) were delayed by both n-3 PUFA, colonic repair was increased in EPA- relative to DHA-fed mice. These results indicate that, during the early response to intestinal wounding, DHA and EPA uniquely delay the activation of key wound-healing processes in the colon.

It is also a major non-cytochrome P450 enzyme in the phase I metabolism of carbonyl-containing drugs, and is highly expressed in the intestine. In this study, we found that long-chain fatty acids and their CoA ester derivatives inhibit CBR1. Among saturated fatty acids, myristic, palmitic and stearic acids were inhibitory, and stearic  was the most potent (IC 9µM). Unsaturated fatty acids (oleic, elaidic, γ- and docosahexaenoic acids) and acyl-CoAs (palmitoyl-, stearoyl- and oleoyl-CoAs) were more potent inhibitors (IC 1.0-2.5µM), and showed high inhibitory selectivity to CBR1 over its isozyme CBR3 and other SDR superfamily enzymes (DCXR and DHRS4) with CBR activity. The inhibition by these fatty acids and acyl-CoAs was competitive with respect to the substrate, showing the K values of 0.49-1.2µM. Site-directed mutagenesis of the substrate-binding residues of CBR1 suggested that the interactions between the fatty acyl chain and the enzyme's Met141 and Trp229 are important for the inhibitory selectivity.

It is a non-conventional oil seed plant and needs to be agronomically adapt for commercial utilization. In the present study, oil extracted from the agronomically adapted high yielding cultivar of B. arvensis seeds was analyzed for its oil content, fatty  (FA) composition, physico-chemical characteristics, total lipids and triacylglycerol molecular species. The oil content, peroxide, , iodine, p-anisidine values and tocopherol content of the oil were 18.53% (w/w), 2.06 meq of active  / kg of oil, 2.55 mg KOH/g oil, 217.2 g I/100g oil, 10.7 and 774.8 mg/kg oil respectively. Oxidative stability as determined by the induction period was found to be 3.1 h. Polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) content of the oil was 81.3% (of total FA), comprising of α- (ALA; 48.5%), SDA (18.6%), linoleic  (LA; 10.3%) and γ- (GLA; 3.9%). Profiling of lipid classes showed neutral lipids (89.3%, w/w) as most abundant lipid class followed by glycolipids (7.4%, w/w) and phospholipids (3.3%, w/w). High resolution mass spectrometric analysis of triacylglycerol (TAG) molecular species showed TAGs with C54 carbons in the acyl chain as most abundant. Positional distribution analysis showed GLA and SDA predominantly at the sn-2 position of triacylglycerol. FTIR analysis revealed common characteristics molecular features similar to PUFA rich oils. Overall, the results suggest that B. arvensis seed oil is an excellent ω3-ω6-ω3 or ALA-SDA-GLA source for food and nutraceutical industries.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29287424>Effect of regulated deficit irrigation on   and their derived volatiles in 'Cabernet Sauvignon' grapes and wines of Ningxia, China.</a></h2><p>The effect of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) on   and their derived volatiles in 'Cabernet Sauvignon' grapes and wines was investigated during two growing seasons in the east foot of Mt.

This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the interaction of rs174547 in  gene with LA and ALA on  (MetS) components. A total of 200 Chinese and Indian vegetarians in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, Malaysia participated in the present study. The data on socio-demographic characteristics, vegetarianism practices, dietary practices, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure (BP), and overnight venous fasting blood samples were collected from the vegetarians. The rs174547 in  gene was significantly associated with MetS and its components such as waist circumference (WC) and fasting blood glucose (FBG). Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that vegetarians with TT genotype of rs174547 in  gene had higher odds for MetS, larger WC, higher BP, and a lower level of HDL-c. Two-way ANOVA analysis showed that LA interacts with rs174547 in  gene to affect HDL-c ( < 0.05) among vegetarians.

Thus far, the pathways and key genes related to oil biosynthesis in developing pecan seeds remain largely unclear. Our analyses revealed that mature pecan embryo accumulated more than 80% oil, in which 90% was unsaturated fatty acids with abundant oleic . RNA sequencing generated 84,643 unigenes in three cDNA libraries prepared from pecan embryos collected at 105, 120, and 165 days after flowering (DAF). We identified 153 unigenes associated with lipid biosynthesis, including 107 unigenes for fatty  biosynthesis, 34 for triacylglycerol biosynthesis, 7 for oil bodies, and 5 for transcription factors involved in oil synthesis. The genes associated with fatty  synthesis were the most abundantly expressed genes at 120 DAF. Additionally, the biosynthesis of oil began to increase while crude fat contents increased from 16.61 to 74.45% (165 DAF). We identified four SAD, two FAD2, one FAD6, two FAD7, and two FAD8 unigenes responsible for unsaturated fatty  biosynthesis. However, FAD3 homologues were not detected. Consequently, we inferred that the  in developing pecan embryos is generated by FAD7 and FAD8 in plastids rather than FAD3 in endoplasmic reticula. During pecan embryo development, different unigenes are expressed for plastidial and cytosolic . Plastidial  is more relevant to lipid synthesis than cytosolic . The 18 most important genes associated with lipid biosynthesis were evaluated in five stages of developing embryos using quantitative PCR (qPCR). The qPCR data were well consistent with their expression in transcriptomic analyses.

C57BL/6 J mice were allocated into five groups (n = 10/group) to receive diet C [30% soybean oil (SBO)], BM [25% SBO + 5% BMSO], BMS, BMNS or BMD. For the three latter diets, saponifiables (hydrolyzed fatty acids from BMSO), non-saponifiables (excluding fatty acids from BMSO) or bleaching oil (excluding pigments from BMSO), respectively, were added in amount equivalent to their content in 5% BMSO and SBO was added to bring total fat to 30%. After 14 wk., indices associated with adiposity and safety, as well as lipid metabolic signaling in white adipose tissue (WAT), were measured.The body fat percentage of mice in group BM, BMS, BMNS, and BMD were 90 ± 26, 76 ± 21, 115 ± 30 and 95 ± 17% of that in group C.

An increase in anti-inflammatory metabolites (hepatic n-3 PUFAs, serum mammalian lignans, and cecal short-chain fatty acids) was associated with consumption of all FS-based diets, but not with anti-inflammatory effects in DSS-exposed mice. Dietary FS exacerbated DSS-induced acute , as indicated by a heightened disease activity index and an increase in colonic injury and inflammatory biomarkers [histological damage, apoptosis, myeloperoxidase, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1β), and NF-κB signaling-related genes (Nfkb1, Ccl5, Bcl2a1a, Egfr, Relb, Birc3, and Atf1)]. Additionally, the adverse effect of the FS diet was extended systemically, as serum cytokines (IL-6, IFNγ, and IL-1β) and hepatic cholesterol levels were increased. The adverse effects of FS were not associated with alterations in fecal microbial load or systemic bacterial translocation (endotoxemia). Collectively, this study demonstrates that although consumption of a 10% FS diet enhanced the levels of n-3 PUFAs, short-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and lignans in mice, it exacerbated DSS-induced colonic injury and inflammation.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword:['colitis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25169109>In vitro effects of oil's fatty acids on T cell function in gestational diabetic pregnant women and their newborns.</a></h2><p>The aim of this investigation was to determine the in vitro effects of linseed, olive and Nigel oils on T cell proliferation and function in gestational .Blood samples were collected from 40 control healthy and 32 gestational diabetic mothers and their newborns.

We have previously found that female offspring of rat dams that consumed a lard-based high-fat (HF) diet (60% fat-derived ) during pregnancy, or during pregnancy and lactation, were at a reduced risk of developing mammary cancer. To better understand the unexpected protective effects of early life lard exposure, we have applied lipidomics and nutrigenomics approaches to investigate the fatty  profile and global gene expression patterns in the mammary tissue of the female offspring. Consumption of this HF diet during gestation had few effects on the mammary tissue fatty acids profile of young adult offspring, while exposure from gestation throughout nursing promoted significant alterations in the fatty acids profile. Major differences were related to decreases in saturated fatty acids (SFA) and increases in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and conjugated  (CLA) concentrations. In addition several differences in gene expression patterns by microarray analysis between the control and in utero or in utero and during lactation HF exposed offspring were identified. Differential dependency network (DDN) analysis indicated that many of the genes exhibited unique connections to other genes only in the HF offspring. These unique connections included Hrh1-Ythdf1 and Repin1-Elavl2 in the in utero HF offspring, and Rnf213-Htr3b and Klf5-Chrna4 in the in utero and lactation HF offspring, compared with the control offspring. We conclude that an exposure to a lard-based HF diet during early life changes the fatty  profile and transcriptional network in mammary gland in young adult rats, and these changes appear to be consistent with reduced mammary cancer risk observed in our previous study.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The diabetic, acidotic coma as an acute deficiency of acetyl-CoA and ATP].</a></h2><p>The mechanisms of beta-oxidation of fatty acids developed more than a century before have no compliance with actual physical chemical data. The oxidation of long-chain C 16:0 palmitic saturated fatty  occurs not by sequential formation of eight molecules of acetyl-KoA but by force of formation of double bond and its hydrolysis on two short-chain C 8:0 fatty acids. Only short-chain fatty acids can become shorter under "chipping" of C 2-acetate with formation of C 4-butyric  (butyrate) and its metabolites (beta-hidroxibutirate, acetoacetate, acetone). The critical moment of oxidation is a hydrolysis of acetoacetyl-KoA on two molecules of acetyl-KoA. The molecule of ATP is to be expended on hydrolysis. The foundation of nonspecific biological reaction of stress--ketoacidosis,--is a decrease in mitochondrions of acetyl-KoA pool formed both from glycogen and glucose and fatty acids. The oxalate acetate inputs into Krebs cycle inadequate amount of acetyl-KoA which limits synthesis of ATP. The insulin has no direct involvement into development of ketoacidosis but prepares conditions to facilitate nonspecific etiological factor to initiate diabetic ketoacidosis. These are the pooling of small amount of glycogen in cytozol and the predominance in cytozol of cells and adipocytes of palmitic triglycerides which are slowly hydrolyzed by hormone-dependent lipase to release non-esterified fatty acids into intercellular medium. The increase of their concentration in blood plasma precedes ketoacidosis which is developing in patients without diabetes mellitus too. When cells begin to oxidize unsaturated linoleic and  acids with large number of double binds instead of medium-chain fatty acids, oleinic and palmitic fatty acids to support beta-oxidation in mitochondrions and synthesis of ATP the amount of butyric , beta-hidroxibutiryl-KoA and acetoacetyl-KoA increases and of acetyl-KoA decreases. The cause of fatal outcome is the development of metabolic acidosis, hyperhydration of cerebral cells with development of edema and a physiologic respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis. The decarboxylation of acetoacetate and formation of acetone--initial stage of gluconeogenesis--formation of glucose from fatty acids--is manifested poorly both in primates and humans. From theoretical positions, to arrest ketoacidosis and to restore synthesis of AFT, it is reasonable to apply the infusion of optimal amount of acetyl-KoA which as nonpolar tioester can get over hematoencephalic barrier, plasma membrane and inner membrane of mitochondrions. It is supposed that diabetes mellitus is to be considered primarily as pathology of metabolism of fatty acids and only secondly as pathology of glucose.</p><p>Keyword:['gluconeogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30221357>ALA-mediated biphasic downregulation of α-7nAchR/HIF-1α along with mitochondrial stress modulation strategy in mammary gland chemoprevention.</a></h2><p>The study elucidates the effect of ɑ- (ALA) on mitochondrial stress, hypoxic cancer microenvironment, and intervention of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway using N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) induced estrogen receptor (ER+) mammary gland carcinoma and Caenorhabditis elegans model, respectively.

Specifically, the miR167OE seeds had a lower α- with a concomitantly higher linoleic  content than the wild-type. This decreased level of fatty  desaturation corresponded to a decreased transcriptional expression of the camelina fatty  desaturase3 (CsFAD3) in developing seeds. MiR167 targeted the transcription factor auxin response factor (CsARF8) in camelina, as had been reported previously in Arabidopsis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments combined with transcriptome analysis indicated that CsARF8 bound to promoters of camelina bZIP67 and ABI3 genes. These transcription factors directly or through the ABI3-bZIP12 pathway regulate CsFAD3 expression and affect α- accumulation. In addition, to decipher the miR167A-CsARF8 mediated transcriptional cascade for CsFAD3 suppression, transcriptome analysis was conducted to implicate mechanisms that regulate seed size in camelina. Expression levels of many genes were altered in miR167OE, including orthologs that have previously been identified to affect seed size in other plants. Most notably, genes for seed coat development such as suberin and lignin biosynthesis were down-regulated.

Twenty patients with T2DM were included and randomly assigned to receive 3 g/d of ALA or placebo for 60 d, in a double-blind design. The assessment of IS by HEC was performed at baseline and after 60 d in all patients; blood samples were taken for the measurement of serum lipids, glucose, , adiponectin, and cytokines. The primary outcome variables were an increase of both glucose infusion rate (GIR) in steady state and glucose metabolization (M) by HEC. The secondary outcomes were an increase in adiponectin levels and a decrease in fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, homeostasis model assessment-estimated  (HOMA-IR) index, lipids and cytokines. The study was conducted at an academic medical center.The ALA group improved IS corrected for fat-free mass (M/FFM; P = 0.04). Both groups showed increased adiponectin after 60 d (P = 0.01), however, the increase for the ALA group was greater (P = 0.04).

In this consensus document the scientific evidence relating effects of dietary fat quantity and quality on cardiovascular risk is reviewed and recommendations for the Spanish adult population are issued. As a novelty in nutrition guidelines, emphasis is made more on parent foods than on fatty acids per se. In summary, replacing saturated fatty acids (SFA) for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) reduces cardiovascular risk. Recent data suggest that SFA proper may be harmful or not depending on the parent food, a reason why an intake threshold is not established, but consumption of foods containing excess SFA, such as butter, some processed meats, and commercial confectionery and fried foods is discouraged. The established threshold of <1 % of  intake as trans FA, well known to be harmful for cardiovascular risk, is fulfilled in Spain due in part to its present low levels in margarines. MUFA are beneficial or neutral for cardiovascular risk depending on their dietary sources (virgin olive oil versus other fats), and no intake limitations are established.n-6 PUFA are cardioprotective and recommended intakes (5-10 % of ) are not always fulfilled in the Spanish population, thus increased consumption of their vegetable food sources (seeds, derived oils, and margarines)is encouraged. Marine n-3 PUFA are also cardioprotective and the recommendation stands to eat fatty fish≥2 servings/weeks to reach intake levels of at least 250 mg/day. Increasing evidence suggests that  (ALA), the vegetable n-3 PUFA, is also cardioprotective,but the parent foods (walnuts, soy products,green-leaf vegetables) may provide benefits beyond ALA itself. Finally, low-fat (high carbohydrate, particularly when having a high glycemic index) diets appear to lack cardiovascular preventive effects, while high-fat,high-vegetable fat dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet, are protective, a reason why no upper limit on fat intake is established for the Spanish population.This position statement targets dietitians, nutritionists and other health professionals involved in dietary counsel so they can deliver it rightly and according to the last scientific evidence.Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014.

The culture media composition plays a crucial role in biomass and  production and productivity.The photosynthetic green microalga C. vulgaris was studied in three distinct cultivation experiments each for 22 days, using BG11 and f/2 culture media to investigate the effects of different levels of nitrogen and culture media replacement on cell growth,  production and productivity.In f/2 culture medium, the total  production reached was 0.246 g L-1 (41.55%) which was 147% higher than its counterpart in BG11 medium (0.298 g L-1). On the other hand, the highest biomass (1.492 g L-1) was attained in BG11-3 medium with 6.00 g nitrate L-1 and this was correlated with higher total chlorophyll content (15.189 mg L-1) and cell number (3.812 × 106 cell mL-1). A fatty  profile, composed of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids was detected and included stearic , oleic , α- and γ- which have nutritional or combustion importance.These data suggest that this C. vulgaris strain may be considered as a robust source for biomass,  and green energy production.

Nitrogen (N) deficiency is a common strategy to trigger the lipid accumulation in oleaginous microorganisms. Although a simple pathway from N depletion in the medium to lipid accumulation has been elucidated at the enzymatic level, global changes at protein levels upon N depletion have not been investigated. In this study, we have systematically analyzed the changes at the levels of protein expression in M. circinelloides WJ11, a high lipid-producing strain (36 %, lipid/cell dry weight), during lipid accumulation.Proteomic analysis demonstrated that N depletion increased the expression of glutamine synthetase, involved in ammonia assimilation, for the supply of cellular nitrogen but decreased the metabolism of amino acids. Upon N deficiency, many proteins (e.g., fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase) involved in glycolytic pathway were up-regulated while proteins involved in the tricarboxylic  cycle (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinyl-CoA ligase, succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase) were down-regulated, indicating this activity was retarded thereby leading to a greater flux of carbon into fatty  biosynthesis. Moreover, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, transaldolase and transketolase, which participate in the pentose phosphate pathway, were up-regulated, leading to the increased production of NADPH, the reducing power for fatty  biosynthesis. Furthermore, protein and nucleic  metabolism were down-regulated and some proteins involved in  metabolism, signal transduction, molecular chaperone and redox homeostasis were up-regulated upon N depletion, which may be the cellular response to the stress produced by the onset of N deficiency.N limitation increased those expressions of the proteins involved in ammonia assimilation but decreased that involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids. Upon N deprivation, the glycolytic pathway was up-regulated, while the activity of the tricarboxylic  cycle was retarded, thus, leading more carbon flux to fatty  biosynthesis. Moreover, the pentose phosphate pathway was up-regulated, then this would increase the production of NADPH. Together, coordinated regulation of central carbon metabolism upon N limitation, provides more carbon flux to acetyl-CoA and NADPH for fatty  biosynthesis.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413241>Elaeagnus mollis Oil Attenuates Non-alcoholic Fatty Disease in High-fat Diet Induced Obese Mice via Modifying the Expression of Lipid Metabolismrelated Genes.</a></h2><p>Elaeagnus mollis oil (EMO), which is a type of plant oil, was extracted from the nuts of Elaeagnus mollis Diels that is known as a precious woodyoilcrop in China. The present study investigated the ameliorative effects of EMO on high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and explored relative regulation mechanism. The analysis of EMO fatty acids showed that EMO rich in unsaturated fatty acids (92.07%), such as linoleic  (48.24%), oleic  (34.20%) and  (7.57%). In addition, supplementation of EMO could ameliorate the increase in body weight, fat weight, and abnormal serum lipids induced by high-fat diet. A further important implication is that the levels of serum ALT, serum AST, hepatic TG, TC, SOD, GSH/GSSG ration and MDA were improved after supplementing with EMO. All these changes may be due to the ability of EMO to inhibit fatty  synthesis via reducing the mRNA expression of SREBP-1c, PPARγ and FAS, and elevate fatty  oxidation by increasing the mRNA expression of PPARα and CPT-1. Meanwhile, our results also showed that endogenously synthesized n-3 PUFAs could significantly increase after treating with EMO.

In the presence of 20.7 ppm [H2O2] in a 10% mixture of O2 in N2, the effective uptake coefficients of oleic , linoleic  and  are found to be 1.72 ± 0.08, 3.75 ± 0.18 and 5.73 ± 0.14, respectively. These effective uptake coefficients are larger than unity, providing clear evidence for particle-phase secondary chain chemistry. The effective uptake coefficient increases linearly with the number of C=C double bonds in the unsaturated fatty  molecule. Elemental composition analysis reveals that there is an addition of, on average, 0.57 ± 0.02, 0.61 ± 0.01 and 0.73 ± 0.04 O atoms per reactive loss of oleic , linoleic  and , respectively, which suggests that OH addition to the C=C double bond is not the sole reaction pathway that consumes the molecular species. These results suggest the potential presence of secondary reactions that consume the unsaturated fatty  molecular species without increasing the particulate  content. As the unsaturated fatty  particles become more oxygenated, volatilization also becomes significant.

Thus, correlating the proteomic profiles with the biochemical and physiological changes occurring in the oriental melon is very important for advancing our understanding of oriental melon quality in the ripening processes.iTRAQ-based protein profiling was conducted on 'YuMeiren' oriental melon fruit at different developmental stages. Physiological quality indices, including firmness, rind colour, soluble solids content (SSC), ethylene production, sugar content and volatile compounds were also characterized during four maturity periods of the melon, including 5, 15, 25 and 35 days after anthesis (DAA). A principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the aroma volatiles at 5 DAA and 15 DAA were similar and separated from that of 35 DAA.

In our laboratory, it was demonstrated that one group of pregnant rats fed on an EFA deficient diet, and other group of rats fed on the same diet but with 5% of corn oil (rich in linoleic ) showed alterations on the development of the metrial gland. In the present work, 57 female rats of a Wistar strain were fed since weaning with one of the following diets: EFAD: deficient in essential fatty acids, COD: EFAD + 5% corn oil (linoleic  sufficient but alpha-linoleic  deficient); SAD: EFAD + 5% soy oil (both EFA sufficient) and CD: commercial diet. After 3 months the animals were sacrificed on the 13 th. day of gestation. Uteru's horns were dissected and the implantation sities were fixed on formol and embebbed in parafin. The observations were carried out with H/E coloured cross-sections and the corialantoidea placenta, the cities of implantations and the sitios of reabsortions were studied. The metrial gland of DAGE and DAM rats presented structural modifications compared to DC rats. The most relevant findings were: indifferentiation of the granulated metrial gland cells and an increase in the amount of connective tissue. In DAS rats, on the contrary, the aspect of the metrial gland was similar to the observed in the DC group. In the DAGE and the DAM groups Labyrinthium was enlarged with vascular septum group. Mean while DAS was similar to group DC (thin and vascular). Differences in the cities of implantations and reabsortions were not detected. The present results suggest that alpha-linolenico  is essential for the rat placenta to reach normal development.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28452961>Relationship of the Reported Intakes of Fat and Fatty Acids to Body Weight in US Adults.</a></h2><p>Dietary fat composition may modulate energy expenditure and body weight. Little is known about the relationship between fatty  intake and body weight at a population level. The purposes of this study were to compare intakes of energy, macronutrients, and individual fatty acids across BMI categories (1) for the US adult population and, (2) by sociodemographic groups. Reported dietary intake data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and What We Eat in America (WWEIA) surveys in the years 2005-2012 were analyzed. Overall, we found that the reported intake of carbohydrate, protein, total fat, total saturated fat (as well as long-chain saturated fatty acids 14:0-18:0), and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were positively associated with BMI; while lauric  (a medium-chain saturated fatty , 12:0) and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (as well as all individual PUFAs) were not associated with BMI. Non-Hispanic black individuals demonstrated a negative association between BMI and energy intake and a positive association between total PUFAs, linoleic  (LA), α- (ALA) and BMI. Individuals with less than a high school education showed a negative association between BMI and DHA. Mexican-Americans reported intakes with no association between BMI and energy, any macronutrient, or individual fatty acids. These findings support those of experimental studies demonstrating fatty -dependent associations between dietary fatty  composition and body weight. Notably, we observed divergent results for some sociodemographic groups which warrant further investigation.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30410924>Linezolid Inhibited Synthesis of ATP in : Based on GC-MS Metabolomics and HPLC Method.</a></h2><p>Linezolid has been widely used in serious infections for its effective inhibiting effect against multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. However, linezolid caused severe adverse reactions, such as thrombocytopenia, anaemia, optic neuropathy, and near-fatal serotonin syndrome. In order to investigate the toxicity of linezolid, twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into: control group (n=7), low-group (n=8), and high-group (n=9). The rats of low-group and high-group were given by gavage with linezolid 60 and 120 mg/kg/day for 7 days, respectively. The serum concentration of linezolid was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); blood metabolic change was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration in HepG2-C3A after being cultured with linezolid was determined by HPLC. The results showed that there were six metabolites and nine metabolites had statistical differences in low-group and high-group (P<0.05). The trimethyl phosphate was the most significant indicator in those changed metabolites.

Liver of ethanol-treated animals was characterized by fatty and hydropic dystrophies. Liver triglyceride contents and activitiies of serum marker enzymes were significantly increased. Ethanol increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH)-induced chemiluminescence and the contents of liver thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS). The reduced glutathione content in the liver was decreased. Ethanol enhanced liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) content, aniline p-hydroxylase and amydopyrine-N-demethylase activities. The treatment with borage oil improved the liver morphology, decreased triglyceride contents and normalized serum marker enzyme activities. Borage oil developed an antioxidant effect in ethanol-treated rats. The treatment with this compound decreased NADPH-induced chemiluminescence and the content of lipid peroxidation products. Borage oil normalized CYP450 content compared with the ethanol-treated group. CYPI450 2E1 isoform is a main source of free  radicals in the liver of ethanol-treated rats and we propose that the antioxidant effect of borage oil is realized via the normalization of CYP450 content and activities of CYP450-related microsomal oxidases, as borage oil can improve the lipid surrounding of CYP450. In our opinion, the hepatoprotection by borage oil in alcoholic steatosis is connected with its antioxidant properties.Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25014256> of olive trees (Olea europaea L.) with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus sp. modified the glycolipids biosynthesis and resulted in accumulation of unsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>The influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi  on photosynthesis, mineral nutrition, the amount of phospholipids and glycolipids in the leaves of olive (Olea europaea L.) trees was investigated.

The inoculation treatment increased the foliar P and Mg but not N. The amount of glycolipids in the leaves of M plants was significantly higher than that of NM plants. However, the amount of phospholipids in the leaves of M plants was not significantly different to that in the leaves of NM plants. Also, we observed a significant increase in the level of α- (C18:3ω3) in glycolipids of M plants.

However, the miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism on long-chain (≥C) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) biosynthesis in vertebrates remains largely unknown. Here, we address a potentially important role of miRNA-24 (miR-24) in the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in rabbitfish Siganus canaliculatus. miR-24 showed significantly higher abundance in liver of rabbitfish reared in brackish water than in seawater for fish fed vegetable oil diets and in S. canaliculatus hepatocyte line (SCHL) cells incubated with  (ALA) than the control group. Similar expression patterns were also observed on the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (srebp1) and LC-PUFA biosynthesis related genes. While opposite results were observed on the expression of insulin-induced gene 1 (insig1), an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein blocking Srebp1 proteolytic activation. Luciferase reporter assays revealed rabbitfish insig1 as a target of miR-24. Knockdown of miR-24 in SCHL cells resulted in increased Insig1 protein, and subsequently reduced mature Srebp1 protein and expression of genes required for LC-PUFA biosynthesis, and these effects could be attenuated after additional insig1 knockdown. Opposite results were observed with overexpression of miR-24. Moreover, increasing endogenous insig1 by knockdown of miR-24 inhibited Srebp1 processing and consequently suppressed LC-PUFA biosynthesis in rabbitfish hepatocytes. These results indicate a potentially critical role for miR-24 in regulating LC-PUFA biosynthesis through the Insig1/Srebp1 pathway by targeting insig1. This is the first report of miR-24 involved in LC-PUFA biosynthesis and thus may provide knowledge on the regulatory mechanisms of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in vertebrates.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

An oxidative burst of phagocytes accompanied by reactive  species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) formation is one of the phagocyte functions that could be modulated by PUFAs.To investigate the effects of omega-3 (, docosahexaenoic, eicosapentaenoic) and omega-6 (arachidonic, linoleic) PUFAs on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated ROS and RNS production by the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7.Murine peritoneal macrophages RAW 264.7 were stimulated with LPS (0.1 microg/ml) and treated with 0.1-100 microM omega-3 or omega-6 PUFAs for either 8 (ROS production) or 20 h (RNS production). The cytotoxicity of PUFAs was evaluated by an ATP (adenosine triphosphate) test after both 8 and 20 h of treatment with PUFAs. Changes in ROS production by LPS-treated macrophages subsequently activated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or opsonized zymosan particles (OZP) were determined by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence, whilst the production of RNS was determined as the concentration of nitrites in cell supernatants (Griess reaction). Changes in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression were evaluated by Western blot analysis. The antioxidant properties of PUFAs were tested by TRAP (total peroxyl radical-trapping antioxidant parameter) assay.All PUFAs in 100 microM concentration except eicosapentaenoic  decreased ROS production. The effect was most significant when docosahexaenoic  was used. Arachidonic  decreased PMA-activated ROS production even in 1 and 10 microM concentrations. On the other hand, 10 and 100 microM eicosapentaenoic  potentiated ROS production. As concerns RNS production, all the fatty acids that were tested in a concentration of 100 microM decreased iNOS expression and nitrite accumulation. Fatty acids had no significant effect on the viability and proliferation of RAW 264.7 cells. The TRAP assay confirmed that none of the tested PUFAs exerted any significant antioxidant properties.High concentrations of PUFAs of both omega-3 and omega-6 groups can inhibit ROS and RNS formation by stimulated macrophages. The expression of iNOS can also be inhibited. This effect, together with the absence of antioxidant activity and cytotoxic properties, indicates that PUFAs can participate in the regulation of enzymes responsible for reactive species production.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11895154>Fatty acids and lymphocyte functions.</a></h2><p>The immune system acts to protect the host against pathogenic invaders. However, components of the immune system can become dysregulated such that their activities are directed against host tissues, so causing damage. Lymphocytes are involved in both the beneficial and detrimental effects of the immune system. Both the level of fat and the types of fatty  present in the diet can affect lymphocyte functions. The fatty  composition of lymphocytes, and other immune cells, is altered according to the fatty  composition of the diet and this alters the capacity of those cells to produce eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin E2, which are involved in immunoregulation. A high fat diet can impair lymphocyte function. Cell culture and animal feeding studies indicate that oleic, linoleic, conjugated linoleic, gamma-, dihomo-gamma-, arachidonic, , eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids can all influence lymphocyte proliferation, the production of cytokines by lymphocytes, and natural killer cell activity. High intakes of some of these fatty acids are necessary to induce these effects. Among these fatty acids the long chain n-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic , appear to be the most potent when included in the human diet. Although not all studies agree, it appears that fish oil, which contains eicosapentaenoic , down regulates the T-helper 1-type response which is associated with chronic inflammatory disease. There is evidence for beneficial effects of fish oil in such diseases; this evidence is strongest for rheumatoid arthritis. Since n-3 fatty acids also antagonise the production of inflammatory eicosanoid mediators from arachidonic , there is potential for benefit in asthma and related diseases. Recent evidence indicates that fish oil may be of benefit in some asthmatics but not others.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10980499>Enhanced enteral bioavailability of vancomycin using water-in-oil-in-water multiple emulsion incorporating highly purified unsaturated fatty .</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of an emulsion incorporating unsaturated fatty acids to improve the mucosal absorption of poorly absorbed drugs from rat intestinal loops in situ, using a water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) multiple emulsion.

Our objective was to evaluate the published literature and distinguish between the individual effects of flaxseed oil and flax lignans on bone to elucidate the exact role of ALA in skeletal biology. The search was conducted in several databases resulting in 129 articles of which 30 were eligible for inclusion in this review. The studies showed that consumption of whole flaxseeds did not lead to a marked improvement of osteoporotic bones in humans and animals. However, when combined with estrogen therapy, flaxseed supplementation offered an extra benefit to bone in animal models. Similar results were found in studies conducted with flaxseed oil (predominantly ALA), but the favorable role of flaxseed oil was more obvious in various pathologic conditions (kidney disease, obesity with ), resulting in improved bone properties. In contrast, despite a marginal estrogenic effect, the consumption of flax lignans resulted in little benefit to bone and the effect was limited to early life of females only in animal models. Based on the available studies, it could be concluded that supplementation with flaxseeds may contribute to some improvement in osteoporotic bone properties but the bone-protective effect may be attributed to ALA, not to the lignan fraction of flaxseeds.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

After 24 hr of preincubation in the presence of the aforementioned fatty acids, [1-14C]eicosa-8,11,14-trienoic acid was added to the culture medium as the only lipidic source. Twenty-four hours later the synthesis of arachidonic acid and the fatty acid composition of the cells were determined. At 20 microM concentration the omega 6 fatty acids studied except docosapentaenoic acid produced an increase on the biosynthesis of arachidonic acid compared to the cells incubated in the absence of unlabeled fatty acids in the medium. The fatty acids added to the culture medium were incorporated into the cells and modified their fatty acid composition. Columbinic acid, with a similar structure to linoleic acid, also produced a significant increase on the conversion of eicosatrienoic acid to arachidonic acid. These results would suggest that the effect of both, linoleic and columbinic acids, may be adscribed to their configuration and not necessarily to their transformation in higher homologs, since columbinic acid is unable to be desaturated.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26694605>A High-Fat, High-Oleic Diet, But Not a High-Fat, Saturated Diet, Reduces Hepatic α- and Eicosapentaenoic  Content in Mice.</a></h2><p>Considerable research has focused upon the role of linoleic  (LNA; 18:2n-6) as a competitive inhibitor of α- (ALA; 18:3n-3) metabolism; however, little data exist as to the impact of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) on ALA metabolism. We tested the hypothesis that a high SFA diet, compared to a high MUFA (oleic  18:1n-9) diet, reduces ALA conversion to long chain n-3 fatty acids. Mice were fed for 12 weeks on three diets: (1) a control, 16 % fat energy diet consisting of similar levels of SFA and MUFA (2) a 50 % fat energy high MUFA energy diet (35 % MUFA and 7 % SFA) or (3) a 50 % fat energy, high SFA energy diet (34 % SFA, 8 % MUFA). ALA and LNA content remained constant. Analysis of hepatic lipids demonstrated a selective reduction (40 %) in ALA but not LNA and a 35 % reduction in eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; 20:5n-3) in the high MUFA mice compared to the other groups. Lower content of ALA was reflected in the neutral lipid fraction, while smaller levels of phospholipid esterified EPA and docosapentaenoic  (DPA; 22:5n-3) were evident. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) content was elevated by the high SFA diet. Expression of Fads1 (Δ5 desaturase) and Fads2 (Δ6 desaturase) was elevated by the high MUFA and reduced by the high SFA diet. These data indicate that a high MUFA diet, but not a high SFA diet, reduces ALA metabolism and point to selective hepatic disposition of ALA versus LNA.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24043219>UVA irradiation of fatty acids and their oxidized products substantially increases their ability to generate singlet .</a></h2><p>UVA radiation plays an important role for adverse reactions in human tissue. UVA penetrates epidermis and dermis of skin being absorbed by various biomolecules, especially endogenous photosensitizers. This may generate deleterious singlet  ((1)O2) that oxidizes fatty acids in cell membranes, lipoproteins, and other lipid-containing structures such as the epidermal barrier. Indications exist that fatty acids are not only the target of (1)O2 but also act as potential photosensitizers under UVA irradiation, if already oxidized. Five different fatty acids in ethanol solution (stearic, oleic, linoleic,  and arachidonic ) were exposed to UVA radiation (355 nm, 100 mW) for 30 seconds. (1)O2 luminescence was detected time-resolved at 1270 nm and confirmed in spectrally-resolved experiments. The more double bonds fatty acids have the more (1)O2 photons were detected. In addition, fatty acids were continuously exposed to broadband UVA for up to 240 min. During that time span, UVA absorption and (1)O2 luminescence substantially increased with irradiation time, reached a maximum and decreased again. HPLC-MS analysis showed that the amount of peroxidized fatty acids and the (1)O2 generation increased and decreased in parallel. This indicates the high potential of peroxidized fatty acids to produce (1)O2 under UVA irradiation. In conclusion, fatty acids along with peroxidized products are weak endogenous photosensitizers but become strong photosensitizers under continuous UVA irradiation. Since fatty acids and their oxidized products are ubiquitous in living cells and in skin, which is frequently and long-lasting exposed to UVA radiation, this photosensitizing effect may contribute to initiation of deleterious photooxidative processes in tissue.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22070203>Effects of heat and ultraviolet radiation on the oxidative stability of pine nut oil supplemented with carnosic acid.</a></h2><p>The effects of carnosic acid (CA) of different concentrations (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/g) and two common antioxidants (butylated hydroxytoluene and α-tocopherol) on oxidative stability in pine nut oil at different accelerated conditions (heating and ultraviolet radiation) were compared. The investigation focused on the increase in peroxide and conjugated diene values, as well as free fatty acid and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. The changes in trans fatty acid and aldehyde compound contents were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, while the changes in  content were monitored by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results show that CA was more effective in restraining pine nut oil oxidation under heating, UV-A and UV-B radiation, in which a dose-response relationship was observed. The antioxidant activity of CA was stronger than that of α-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene. Pine nut oil supplemented with 0.2 mg/g CA exhibited favorable antioxidant effects and is preferable for effectively avoiding oxidation.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27706704>Chemical and genetic diversity of high-seed-yield sorghum (Sorghum bicolor M.) germplasms.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the chemical and genetic diversity of high-seed-yield sorghum germplasms from Korea, the United States, and South Africa. We identified significant differences in the chemical contents of whole plants at the heading stage in all cultivars, including differences in crude protein, fat, fiber, ash, neutral detergent fiber,  detergent fiber, mineral, and fatty  contents. Our results suggest that Banwoldang is the most appropriate cultivar for roughage because of its high protein yield. We identified significant differences in the tannin, flavonoid, amylose, mineral, crude fat, fatty , and 3-deoxyanthocyanin contents in the whole grain from all cultivars, but not in the mineral or crude fat contents. Tannin levels were generally low. IS645 contained the highest levels of flavonoids and  compounds, and Moktak had the highest amylose and deoxyanthocyanidin content in the grain. To assess genetic diversity, we used 10 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer sets to identify 38 alleles with 3-8 alleles per locus. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the SSR markers, the sorghum cultivars were divided into three major groups. Comparison of clusters based on chemical compositions with those based on SSRs showed that the groups formed by the three native Korean cultivars clustered similarly in molecular dendrograms. Association analysis was conducted for the 10 SSR marker; 48 chemical and growth traits were present for two marker traits (seed color and whole plant fatty  content) with significant marker-trait associations. These markers could be used to select sorghum cultivars for breeding programs.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2558092>[A new concept of the etiopathogenesis and prevention of atopic dermatitis].</a></h2><p>The hypothesis proposed for the pathogenesis of atopy links the well-known alterations in cell-mediated and humoral , the disturbances of mediator metabolism and the increased disposition of atopic epidermis for inflammation to a common underlying deficiency in the production of prostaglandin E1.

Through the measurement of oxidized polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), oxidative stress, and  status in liver and heart tissues of apolipoprotein E (ApoE  ), mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) or HFD with oat bran (HFD + Oat) were investigated. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), PUFA and over 40 types of its oxidized products were assessed. The HFD + Oat group had augmented adrenic  (ADA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and suppressed n-3 docosapentaenoic  levels in the liver tissues compared to the HFD group. Arachidonic  (ARA) and α- (ALA) levels were elevated and ADA was suppressed in the heart tissues of the HFD + Oat group compared to the HFD group. Furthermore, enzymatically mediated oxidized ARA product levels (9-, 11- and 20-HETE [hydroxyeicosatetraenoic ], and PGF ) were augmented and those of the oxidized DHA products (4-, 7-, 10-, 11-, 13-, and 14-HDHA [hydroxy-docosahexaenoic ]) were reduced in the liver tissues of the HFD + Oat group. It also increased 17-F -dihomo-isoprostane and 7-F -dihomo-isofuran derived from nonenzymatic oxidation of ADA in the heart and liver tissues, and those from ALA namely 16-F -phytoprostane and 16(RS)-13-epi-STΔ -9-phytofuran. Our study showed oat bran to be a weak antioxidant and lacked anti-inflammatory properties in atherosclerotic mice. Elevation of oxidized PUFA products that are potentially proinflammatory and vasoconstrictors (HETE, PGF ) with simultaneous reduction of those that are anti-inflammatory (HDHA) may not be desirable in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.© 2018 AOCS.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26111478>Phospholipid Incorporation of Non-Methylene-Interrupted Fatty Acids (NMIFA) in Murine Microglial BV-2 Cells Reduces Pro-Inflammatory Mediator Production.</a></h2><p>Sciadonic acid (SCA),  (PNA), and Δ7-eicosatrienoic acid (Δ7-ETrA) are three non-methylene-interrupted fatty acids (NMIFA). Using murine microglial BV-2 cells, this study determined how NMIFA incorporation modulated phospholipid fatty acid composition and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Each NMIFA was rapidly taken up and incorporated in BV-2 cells, resulting in the differential redistribution of total lipids. The cellular phospholipid fatty acid compositions were altered, and a significant decrease in the proportions of total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was observed while the proportions of NMIFA and its metabolites accounted for 38% of the fatty acid total. Incubation of microglial cells with NMIFA suppressed production of LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well as the over-expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and type 2 cyclooxygenase (COX-2). These inhibitory effects could be accounted for, in part, by the inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling. In conclusion, Δ7-ETrA, PNA, and SCA are anti-inflammatory NMIFA that may be useful in suppressing in vitro immune responses involved in neural inflammation.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29934171>Nutritional value and chemical composition of Greek artichoke genotypes.</a></h2><p>The nutritional value and chemical composition of various artichoke genotypes cultivated in Greece were evaluated.

This study examined the effects of omega-3  (ALA) during in vitro oocyte maturation (IVM) in the presence of PSO on subsequent embryo development and quality, and the cellular mechanisms that might be involved. Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were supplemented during IVM with ALA (50 μM), PSO (425 μM), or PSO+ALA. Compared with FFA-free controls (P < 0.05), PSO increased embryo fragmentation and decreased good quality embryos on day 2 postfertilization. Day 7 blastocyst rate was also reduced. Day 8 blastocysts had lower cell counts and higher apoptosis but normal metabolic profile. In the PSO group, cumulus cell (CC) expansion was inhibited with an increased CC apoptosis while COC metabolism was not affected. Mitochondrial inner membrane potential (MMP; JC-1 staining) was reduced in the CCs and oocytes. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) but not glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78, known as BiP; an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker) was upregulated in the CCs. Higher reactive oxygen species levels (DCHFDA staining) were detected in the oocytes. In contrast, adding ALA in the presence of PSO normalized embryo fragmentation, cleavage, blastocyst rates, and blastocyst quality compared to controls (P > 0.05). Combined treatment with ALA also reduced CC apoptosis, partially recovered CC expansion, abrogated the reduction in MMP in the CCs but not in the oocytes, and reduced BiP and HSP70 expression in CCs, compared with PSO only (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ALA supplementation protected oocyte developmental capacity under lipotoxic conditions mainly by protecting cumulus cell viability.© The Authors 2017.

To reach these objectives, Spearman correlations, group comparisons, and stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed. The proportion of palmitic  (16:0) in the TG fraction was positively associated with plasma fasting insulin (r =.25, P =.03), diastolic (r =.45, P <.001), and systolic (r =.29, P =.003) blood pressure. On the other hand, the proportion of  (18:3n-3) was associated negatively with apolipoprotein (apo) B (r = -.29, P =.005) and positively with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) diameter (r =.29, P =.007), while the proportion of gamma- (18:3n-6) was associated negatively with plasma TG (r = -.33, P =.003), diastolic (r = -.29, P =.01), and systolic (r = -.35, P =.002) blood pressure and plasma fasting insulin (r = -.37, P =.0005) and positively with high-density lipoprotein (HDL)(2)-cholesterol (r =.27, P =.01) and LDL diameter (r =.25, P =.02). Stepwise multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the contribution of visceral AT, body fat mass, and the fatty  content of TG to the variance of  variables studied. It was found that visceral AT contributed significantly to the variance in plasma TG (R(2) = 20.7%, P <.0001), apo B (R(2) = 9.0%, P =.007), HDL(2)-cholesterol (R(2) = 17.9%, P <.0001), LDL diameter (R(2) = 4.9%, P =.02), and area under the glucose curve (AUC-glucose) (R(2) = 8.2%, P =.006). On the other hand, body fat mass contributed significantly to the variance in fasting insulin (R(2) = 19.7%, P <.0001) and diastolic (R(2) = 6.8%, P =.007) and systolic (R(2) = 10.5%, P =.01) blood pressure. At least one fatty  made a significant contribution to the variance of each  variable studied. In fact, the proportion of 18:3n-6 contributed significantly to the variance in both TG (R(2) = 8.9%, P = 0.007) and HDL(2)-cholesterol (R(2) = 6.0%, P =.01). Moreover, 18:3n-3 contributed to the variance of apo B (R(2) = 7.0%, P =.02), while 18:3n-6 made the largest contribution to the variance of LDL diameter (R(2) = 7.6%, P =.02). Finally, 16:0 significantly contributed to the variance of AUC-glucose (R(2) = 11.4%, P =.0003), diastolic (R(2) = 25.2%, P <.0001), and systolic (R(2) = 6.8%, P =.002) blood pressure.

SOD (superoxide dismutase) restored the inhibitory effect caused by NEFAs, suggesting the involvement of ROS (reactive oxygen species) in removing nitric oxide. The nitric oxide concentration measured after exposure of the rings to acetylcholine was lower after incubation with NEFAs than with Krebs buffer alone. This finding is consistent with removal of nitric oxide by ROS. This claim was supported by the demonstration of increased concentrations of nitrated tyrosine in the rings incubated with NEFAs.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22229443>Fatty acids and vitamins generate singlet  under UVB irradiation.</a></h2><p>UVB radiation is already known as initiator and promoter of carcinogenesis in skin.

UVB radiation altered the photosensitizer molecules during irradiation yielding a change of absorption in the entire ultraviolet spectrum (280-400 nm). UVB irradiation of endogenous photosensitizers produced singlet  that in turn changes the absorption of those molecules. Being an important prerequisite, the changed absorption may either reduce or increase singlet  production. An increase in singlet  generation may initiate a vicious cycle that has the potential to amplify UVB- or UVA-mediated effects in skin cells.© 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306361>Preparation of highly purified  from pine nut oil using a combination of enzymatic esterification and urea complexation.</a></h2><p> (PLA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid of plant origin.

They are not only used for , but also act as signaling molecules. The delta-6 desaturase (D6D) enzyme, encoded by the FADS2 gene, is one of two rate limiting enzymes that convert the PUFA precursors - α- (n-3) and linoleic  (n-6) to their respective metabolites. Alterations in the D6D enzyme activity alters fatty  profiles and are associated with metabolic and inflammatory diseases including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Omega-3 PUFAs, specifically its constituent fatty acids DHA and EPA, are known for their anti-inflammatory ability and are also beneficial in the prevention of skeletal muscle wasting, however the mechanism for muscle preservation is not well understood. Moreover, little is known of the effects of altering the n-6/n-3 ratio in the context of a high-fat diet, which is known to downregulate protein synthesis. Twenty C57BL6 male mice were fed a high-fat lard (HFL, 45% fat (mostly lard), 35% carbohydrate and 20% protein, n-6:n-3 PUFA, 13:1) diet for 6 weeks. Mice were then divided into 4 groups (n = 5 per group): HFL- , high-fat oil- (HFO, 45% fat (mostly Menhaden oil), 35% carbohydrate and 20% protein, n-6:n-3 PUFA, 1:3), HFL+ (HFL diet plus an orally administered FADS2 inhibitor, 100 mg/kg/day), and HFO+ (HFO diet plus an orally administered FADS2 inhibitor, 100 mg/kg/day). After 2 weeks on their respective diets and treatments, animals were sacrificed and gastrocnemius muscle harvested. Protein turnover signaling were analyzed via Western Blot. 4-EBP1 and ribosomal protein S6 expression were measured. A two-way ANOVA revealed no significant change in the phosphorylation of both 4EBP-1 and ribosomal protein S6 with diet or inhibitor. There was a significant reduction in STAT3 phosphorylation with the inhibition of FADS2 (p = 0.03). Additionally, we measured markers of protein degradation through levels of FOXO phosphorylation, ubiquitin, and LC3B expression; there was a trend towards increased phosphorylation of FOXO (p = 0.08) and ubiquitinated proteins (p = 0.05) with FADS2 inhibition. LC3B expression, a marker of autophagy, was significantly higher in the HFL plus FADS2 inhibition group from all other comparisons. Lastly, we analyzed activation of mitochondrial biogenesis which is closely linked with protein synthesis through PGC1-α and Cytochrome-C expression, however no significant differences were associated with either marker across all groups. Collectively, these data suggest that the protective effects of muscle mass by omega-3 fatty acids are from inhibition of protein degradation. Our aim was to determine the role of PUFA metabolites, DHA and EPA, in skeletal muscle protein turnover and assess the effects of n-3s independently. We observed that by inhibiting the FADS2 enzyme, the protective effect of n-3s on protein synthesis and proliferation was lost; concomitantly, protein degradation was increased with FADS2 inhibition regardless of diet.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29931237>Adipogenic/lipogenic gene expression and fatty  composition in chuck, loin, and round muscles in response to grain feeding of Yanbian Yellow cattle.</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that gene expression and fatty  composition would differ among different muscle depots and over time on a grain-based finishing diet. Additionally, we hypothesized that the concentration of SFA would decrease and the concentration of MUFA would increase proportionately with increases in percent intramuscular lipid (%IML). Ten Yanbian Yellow cattle steers (approximately 8 mo of age) were fed a corn-based diet in which the proportion of corn in the ration was increased at 4-mo intervals. Muscle samples were taken by biopsy from the chuck (trapezius), loin (longissimus dorsi), and round (biceps femoris) muscles at 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 mo of age. The %IML increased from 12 to 28 mo of age, especially between 24 and 28 mo of age, with loin > round > chuck (age × muscle interaction P < 0.001). The percentage (g/100 g total fatty acids) of oleic  (18:1n-9), linoleic  (18:2n-6), and α- (18:3n-3), and the MUFA:SFA ratio increased with age, whereas palmitic (16:0) and stearic  (18:0) decreased with age in all muscles (age effect P < 0.001). The expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1), adipose tissue fatty - binding protein (FABP4), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) increased, whereas the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and fatty  synthase (FASN) decreased with age. Expression of PPARγ, FABP4, SREBP1, SCD, FASN, ACC1, and LPL was greater in the loin than in the chuck or round (age × muscle interaction P < 0.001), although the MUFA:SFA ratio was greater in the chuck than in the loin or round (muscle effect P < 0.001). In conclusion, adipogenic gene expression was greater in the loin than in the chuck or round muscles, consistent with the greater %IML of the loin. However, the greater SCD gene expression in the loin did not result in a greater amount of MUFA in the loin, relative to the chuck and round.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29481633>Fatty  addition and thermotolerance of Kluyveromyces marxianus.</a></h2><p>Membrane fatty  composition has an important role in yeast stress resistance, particularly in temperature tolerance. Most studies investigating temperature and membrane fatty acids use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae without considering other yeasts, such as Kluyveromyces marxianus, which has physiological differences and industrial advantages with respect to S. cerevisiae. One of the primary traits of K. marxianus is its thermotolerance. The effect of fatty  addition (oleic , linoleic ,  and araquidic ) on the thermotolerance of the K. marxianus strain SLP1 was evaluated. SLP1 yeast exhibited temperature tolerance of up to 50°C; at 55°C, viability was reduced significantly, probably due to an increase in the generation of reactive  chemical species. Externally added fatty acids were incorporated in the yeast membrane, increasing their proportion to approximately 70%, thereby changing membrane fluidity. SLP1 cells supplemented with polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased cell thermotolerance and increased the degree of lipoperoxidation, while arachidic  addition exhibited a tendency to increase yeast thermotolerance.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9741345>Prostaglandin and fatty  modulation of Escherichia coli O157 phagocytosis by human monocytic cells.</a></h2><p>Phagocytosis by human monocytes is an important primary survival mechanism particularly during bacterial infection. However, the processes that control the events and mediators involved in the activation of monocytes and their impact on the phagocytosis of bacteria are poorly understood. The effect of bacterial endotoxin, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), fatty acids and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on the phagocytosis of fluoroscein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled Escherichia coli (O157) by human blood monocytes and U937 cells was studied by flow cytometry. Endotoxin increased the phagocytosis of labelled bacteria by both monocytes and U937 cells. IL-1 beta and the polyunsaturated fatty acids; dihomo-gamma- and arachidonic acids also increased the phagocytic activity of both monocytes and U937 cells. In contrast, PGE2 suppressed phagocytosis in a concentration-dependent manner. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, ketoprofen, further enhanced the increased phagocytic activity in the presence of endotoxin and interleukin-1 (IL-1) indicating suppression by endogenous prostaglandins. This was confirmed by the data which showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IL-1 increased PGE2 release and ketoprofen inhibited release. Endotoxin and fatty acids increased IL-1 beta release also, whereas PGE2 inhibited release. The data suggest that phagocytic activity may be linked to changes in IL-1 levels. The data presented in this study also suggest that monocyte phagocytosis in the course of bacterial infection would be altered during pathophysiological events which result in elevation of extracellular fatty acids.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22962535>Plasma phospholipid fatty  composition and estimated desaturase activity in heart failure patients with .</a></h2><p> is one of the major factors to increase the incidence of heart failure.

Tree peony seeds contain >90% unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) and high proportions of α- (ALA, > 40%). To dissect the non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) pathway involved in fatty acids synthesis in tree peony seeds, we construct six small RNA libraries and six transcriptome libraries from developing seeds of two cultivars (J and S) containing different content of fatty  compositions. After deep sequencing the RNA libraries, the ncRNA expression profiles of tree peony seeds in two cultivars were systematically and comparatively analyzed. A total of 318 known and 153 new miRNAs and 22,430 lncRNAs were identified, among which 106 conserved and 9 novel miRNAs and 2785 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between the two cultivars. In addition, potential target genes of the microRNA and lncRNAs were also predicted and annotated. Among them, 9 miRNAs and 39 lncRNAs were predicted to target  related genes.

Plasma phospholipid FAs and vitamins were measured, and estimated desaturase activities were calculated at baseline. Anthropometric measurements and diabetes-related assessments were collected at each visit. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the association between plasma nutrient biomarkers and WHtR.In cross-sectional analysis, plasma palmitic  (P = 0.004), dihomo-γ- (DGLA; P = 0.017) and Δ6 desaturase (D6D; P = 0.006) were positively correlated with WHtR after adjustment of confounders.

Missing data on individual fatty acids in the Indonesian food composition table were complemented through chemical analyses of national representative food samples and imputation of data from the US nutrient database. Nutrient adequacy ratios were calculated as a percentage of FAO/WHO intake recommendations. The medians of total fat intake of the children was 26·7 (10th-90th percentile 11·2-40·0) percentage of total daily  (%E).

These specific roles may be of crucial importance in a context of exposure to pollutants. We recently showed that the fatty  profile of rainbow trout liver cell phospholipids modulates sensitivity to an acute methylmercury challenge. In order to investigate mechanisms of effects, we herein tested whether specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may protect cells from methylmercury through decreasing intracellular mercury accumulation and/or enhancing cellular defences (e.g. via modulation of gene expression patterns). We also investigated the inverse relationship and assessed the impact of methylmercury on cellular fatty  . To do so, the fatty  composition of rainbow trout liver cell phospholipids was first modified by incubating them in a medium enriched in a specific PUFA from either the n-3 family (, ALA; eicosapentaenoic , EPA) or the n-6 family (linoleic , LA; arachidonic , AA). Cells were then exposed to methylmercury (0.15 or 0.50 μM) for 24 h and sampled thereafter for assessing phospholipid fatty  profile, intracellular total mercury burden, and expression pattern of genes involved in fatty  , synthesis of PUFA-derived signalling molecules and stress response. We observed that cells incorporated the given PUFA and some biotransformation products in their phospholipids. Methylmercury had few impacts on this cellular phospholipid composition. None of the PUFA enrichments affected the cellular mercury burden, suggesting that the previously observed cytoprotection conferred by ALA and EPA was not linked to a global decrease in cellular accumulation of mercury. Fatty  enrichments and methylmercury exposure both modulated gene expression patterns. Genes involved in the synthesis of PUFA-derived signalling molecules, in stress response and the orphan cytochrome P450 20A1 were identified as possible sites of interaction between fatty acids and methylmercury in rainbow trout liver cells.Copyright © 2018.

Six-week-old mice were fed the different diets for 7 wk. The first vaccination or OVA sensitization was given 2 wk after the start of the dietary intervention. In the mice vaccinated with influenza, the DTH response to the vaccine was significantly higher in mice fed the marine (n-3) PUFA diet compared to all other groups, indicating that these PUFA promote a T helper-1 response.

After removal of bags from the rumen, 4 different washing methods, ranging from manual squeezing to machine washing, were applied. Fatty acids were extracted from washed residues and determined, as methyl esters, by gas chromatography. The main odd-chain fatty acids (with the exception of anteiso C(15:0)) were not found in fresh grass and were useful markers of the effects of incubation time, sample preparation method, and washing method on microbial /contamination. The concentration of these and other odd-chain fatty acids increased with incubation time in both studies. The results indicate rapid and continued microbial  of freshly ingested forages, although patterns of odd-chain fatty acids did not reveal any further information about the types of bacteria-colonizing herbage. Principal component, biplot analysis provided a useful overall description of the processes of microbial  and degradation of plant fatty acids on fresh herbage incubated in the rumen.

Although trans-11 C(18:1) was strongly associated with bacterial markers (odd- and branched-chain fatty acids), its precursor (cis-9, trans-11 C(18:2)) was not associated with bacterial variation, suggesting that its production in the rumen under these conditions was mainly extracellular.</p><p>Keyword:['colonization']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820488>Increased α- Intake during Pregnancy is Associated with Higher Offspring Birth Weight.</a></h2><p>The amount and type of fat in the maternal diet during pregnancy are important contributors to fetal growth.

Unpurified hemozoin contains unspecifically attached unsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic and  acids. The presence in unpurified hemozoin of large quantities of ferric heme with small amounts of free iron makes hemozoin a generator of oxidative radicals capable of forming lipoperoxides or other breakdown products from polyunsaturated fatty acids. Here we show that delipidized hemozoin had reduced toxicity to monocytes. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-elicited burst was poorly affected by delipidized hemozoin (ca. 17% and 21% burst inhibition by delipidized hemozoin vs ca. 75% and 65% burst inhibition by native hemozoin at 20 min or 17 h post-phagocytosis, respectively).

Approximately 84% of 15-HETE attached to hemozoin was in the esterified form. A large preponderance of esterified over free 15-HETE was also noted in supernatants of hemozoin-fed monocytes and in hemozoin-fed monocytes. In the latter cells, remarkable levels of the substance were attained. A dose-dependent curve of inhibition of PMA-elicited oxidative burst was observed. Assuming homogenuous distribution of 15-HETE in hemozoin-fed monocytes, 15(S)-HETE concentrations measured in hemozoin-fed monocytes (8 muMol) would bring about ca. 85% inhibition of PMA-elicited burst.

The activation of caspases, Bax and PARP-1, the cleavage of AIF and the phosphorylation of histone H2AX, all of which are characteristics of typical apoptosis, do not occur in ESA-treated cells. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To clarify the signaling pathways in ESA-mediated apoptosis, we investigated the functions of RIP1, MEK, ERK, as well as AIF. Using an extensive study based on molecular biology, we identified the alternative role of RIP1 in ESA-mediated apoptosis. ESA mediates RIP1-dependent apoptosis in a kinase independent manner. ESA activates serine/threonine phosphatases such as calcineurin, which induces RIP1 dephosphorylation, thereby ERK pathway is activated. Consequently, localization of AIF and ERK in the nucleus, ROS generation and ATP reduction in mitochondria are induced to disrupt mitochondrial cristae, which leads to cell death. Necrostatin (Nec)-1 blocked MEK/ERK phosphorylation and ESA-mediated apoptosis. Nec-1 inactive form (Nec1i) also impaired ESA-mediated apoptosis. Nec1 blocked the interaction of MEK with ERK upon ESA stimulation. Together, these findings provide a new finding that ERK and kinase-independent RIP1 proteins are implicated in atypical ESA-mediated apoptosis.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27222914>Evidences and perspectives in the utilization of CLNA isomers as bioactive compounds in foods.</a></h2><p>Conjugated  (CLNA) isomers are promising lipids owing to their similarities with conjugated linoleic  (CLA) but exerting their bioactivity at lower doses; some isomers also belong to omega 3 family. This review aims to summarize the state of the art about the utilization of CLNA as a functional ingredient. Indeed, in vitro and in vivo studies reported that CLNA exerted anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-obese, and antioxidant activities. However, CLNA has not been tested in humans. These compounds are naturally present in meat and milk fat from ruminants but the highest concentrations are found in vegetable oils. Their incorporation in foodstuffs is one of the most effective strategies to elaborate CLNA-enriched products together with the microbiological production. Lactobacilli, propionibacteria, and bifidobacteria strains have been assayed to produce CLNA isomers but at the current moment there are not high CLNA concentration products elaborated using these strains. Furthermore, it is known that CLNA isomers are highly prone to oxidation when compared with linoleic  and CLA, but the possible effects of elaboration and storage on high CLNA productsare unknown.The utilization of CLNA as a functional compound still remains a challenge and requires more research to address all of its technological and bioactivity aspects.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26930155>Hypolipidemic Activity of Peony Seed Oil Rich in α-, is Mediated Through Inhibition of Lipogenesis and Upregulation of Fatty  β-Oxidation.</a></h2><p>Peony seed oil (PSO) is a new resource food rich in α-(ALA) (38.66%).

Lipid-derived signaling molecules, oxylipins, produced by a multi-branch pathway are central in regulation of a wide range of functions.

In the present work, we examine the role of these two oxylipin branches in plant tolerance to the abiotic stress, namely excessive light. Towards this goal, we have analyzed variable chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of intact leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes with altered oxylipin profile, followed by examining the impact of exogenous application of selected oxylipins on functional activity of photosynthetic apparatus in intact leaves and isolated thylakoid membranes. Our findings unequivocally bridge the function of oxylipins to photosynthetic processes.

Currently, little is known about the plasma lipid species associated with obesity. In this study, we compared plasma lipid fatty  (FA) profiles as a function of BMI. Profiling phospholipid (PL) FAs and their respective oxylipids could predict which obese individuals are more likely to suffer from diseases associated with chronic inflammation or oxidative stress. We investigated the relationship between BMI and plasma PL (PPL) FA composition in 126 men using a quantitative gas chromatography analysis. BMI was inversely associated with both PPL nervonic and linoleic  (LA) but was positively associated with both dihomo-γ- and palmitoleic . Compared to lean individuals, obese participants were more likely to have ω-6 FAs, except arachidonic  and LA, incorporated into PPLs. Obese participants were less likely to have EPA and DHA incorporated into PPLs compared to lean participants. Non-esterified plasma PUFA and oxylipid analysis showed ω-6 oxylipids were more abundant in the obese plasma pool. These ω-6 oxylipids are associated with increased angiogenesis (i.e. epoxyeicosatrienoates), reactive  species (i.e. 9-hydroxyeicosatetraenoate), and inflammation resolution (i.e. Lipoxin A4). In summary, BMI is directly associated with specific PPL FA and increased ω-6 oxylipids.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to determine the coefficients of determination (R) using FA proportions of the mentioned proband characteristics.The FA composition of PC in patients with MetS traits was only associated with waist circumference (R = 0.27), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; R = 0.41), body fat percentage (R = 0.62), and fat mass (R = 0.29). Positive associations were found for dihomo-γ- (DGLA), palmitic, stearic (SA), α- (ALA), and eicosapentaenoic acids, whereas negative associations were found for linoleic (LA), oleic, and docosapentaenoic acids. Palmitoleic  (POA) was positively associated with waist circumference but negatively with fat percentage.

Mixed blood leukocytes principally composed of granulocytes or granulocytes purified by density gradient sedimentation did not accumulate malonyldialdehyde during incubations with these particles, but did when ingesting particles containing linolenate. The phospholipid fatty  composition of monocyte-enriched and purified granulocyte preparations from the same donors were compared. The molar fraction of arachidonate (20:4) in phospholipids from monocyte-rich preparations was 62% greater than that of purified granulocytes. The findings indicate that human monocytes, possibly because of a greater content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in their membranes, peroxidize a greater quantity of endogenous lipids than granulocytes during endocytosis. Normal human granulocytes have the capacity to peroxidize ingested lipids. However, mixed leukocytes from two patients with chronic granulomatous disease produced little malonyldialdehyde when engulfing linolenate-containing particles. Therefore the capacity to peroxidize lipid is related to cellular oxygen metabolism, a function in which chronic granulomatous disease granulocytes are dificient. Malonyldialdehyde chemically prepared by hydrolysis of tetramethoxypropane, by extraction from peroxidized , or purified from extracts of phagocytizing rabbit alveolar macrophages had bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and S. epidermidis.

The role of PUFA in reducing the risk of stroke is uncertain. The concentrations of PUFA in the human body are determined both by dietary intake and by activities of desaturase enzymes. Desaturase enzymes have been associated with chronic diseases, but little is known about their association with stroke risk. We investigated the associations of Δ-6-desaturase (D6D) and Δ-5-desaturase (D5D) activities with stroke risk factors and risk of stroke among 1842 men from the prospective, population-based Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, aged 42-60 years and free of CVD at baseline in 1984-1989. ANCOVA and Cox regression models were used for the analyses. Whole serum desaturase activities were estimated as product:precursor ratios - γ-:linoleic  for D6D and arachidonic :dihomo-γ- for D5D. Higher D6D activity was associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, serum  and TAG concentrations and worse homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA) indices. In contrast, higher D5D activity was associated with lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, serum , LDL-cholesterol, TAG and C-reactive protein concentrations, higher HDL-cholesterol concentration, and better HOMA indices. During the mean follow-up of 21·2 years, 202 stroke cases occurred. Neither D6D activity (multivariable-adjusted extreme-quartile hazard ratios (HR) 1·18; 95 % CI 0·80, 1·74) nor D5D activity (HR 1·06; 95 % CI 0·70, 1·60) were associated with stroke risk.

However, it is unclear to what extent desaturase activity in different lipid fractions contribute to obesity susceptibility. Our aim was to test whether desaturase activity and FA composition are linked to an obese phenotype in rats that are either obesity prone (OP) or resistant (OR) on a high-fat diet (HFD).Two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were given ad libitum (AL-HFD) or calorically restricted (HFD-paired; pair fed to calories consumed by chow-fed rats) access to a HFD. The AL-HFD group was categorized into OP and OR sub-groups based on weight gain over 5 weeks. Five different lipid fractions were examined in OP and OR rats with regard to proportions of essential and very long-chain polyunsaturated FAs: linoleic  (LA), , eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic  and the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) product 16:1n-7. FA ratios were used to estimate activities of the delta-5-desaturase (20:4n-6/20:3n-6), delta-6-desaturase (18:3n-6/18:2n-6), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1; 16:1n-7/16:0, SCD-16 and 18:1n-9/18:0, SCD-18), de novo lipogenesis (16:0/18:2n-6) and FA elongation (18:0/16:0). Fasting , glucose, adiponectin and leptin concentrations were measured in plasma.After AL-HFD access, OP rats had a significantly higher SCD-16 index and 16:1n-7 proportion, but a significantly lower LA proportion, in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) triacylglycerols, as well as significantly higher  and leptin concentrations, compared with OR rats. No differences were found between the two phenotypes in liver (phospholipids; triacylglycerols) or plasma (cholesterol esters; phospholipids) lipid fractions or for plasma glucose or adiponectin concentrations. For the desaturase indices of the HFD-paired rats, the only significant differences compared with the OP or OR rats were higher SCD-16 and SCD-18 indices in SAT triacylglycerols in OP compared with HFD-paired rats.The higher SCD-16 may reflect higher SCD-1 activity in SAT, which in combination with lower LA proportions may reflect higher  and changes in SAT independent of other lipid fractions. Whether a lower SCD-16 index protects against diet-induced obesity is an interesting possibility that warrants further investigation.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23200266>Does α-lipoic  treatment play a role on oxidative stress and  in overweight/obese patients?</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20664735>Antineoplastic effects of gamma  on hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and the mechanism of gamma  (GLA) treatment on human hepatocellular (HCC) cell lines.

The infants chosen had plasma samples of ≥120 µL (volume needed for each FFAu profile measurement) in the first day of life. Infants received IL infusions starting in the second day of life at 1 g/kg/day, increasing by 1-g/kg/day daily up to 3 g/kg/day. FFAu profiles were determined during IL infusion when plasma was available. Profiles are the concentrations of the nine most abundant long-chain FFAu and were determined using novel fluorescent probes.Before intralipid infusion unbound myristic  was the dominant FFAu, as high as 78% of the total FFAu (sum of the 9 FFAu). In contrast, unbound linoleic  was 0% in all infants. With increasing infusion of IL to 3 g/kg/day, unbound linoleic increased to 26% of the total FFAu, with unbound oleic, myristic, and  the second, third and fourth most abundant. The average total FFAu concentration also increased from 4 nM before intralipid to 53 nM at 3 g/kg/day. During IL infusion the FFAu profiles approached the fatty  composition of intralipid at 3 g/kg/day.This first study of FFAu profiles in neonates revealed that before IL infusion unbound linoleic  was zero in all 16 infants and levels of myristic  were exceptionally large, as much as 78% of the total FFAu profile. These results suggest important and previously unrecognized roles of  in early development. Zero unbound linoleic  before IL infusion may help promote closure of the ductus arteriosus but after IL infusion, synthesis of arachidonic from linoleic  may tend to promote patency.

We investigated the effect of perilla oil on -induced hepatic and vascular changes in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and provided underlying mechanisms for potential therapeutic applications. Tomato and paprika extract was added to prevent the oxidation during storage of perilla oil. HFD-fed mice were orally administered palm or perilla oil for 90 days. Food intake, body and liver weight, and serum cholesterol levels were measured. Arterial and hepatic lipid accumulation was determined by histological staining. Hepatic triglyceride levels and the expression of proteins regulating lipid metabolism were analyzed. Food intake and body weight were not different between palm oil-treated and perilla oil-treated mice. Serum cholesterol level was significantly lower in perilla oil-treated mice compared with palm oil-treated mice. HFD-induced lipid accumulation was also lower in thoracic aorta and liver by perilla oil compared with palm oil. Perilla oil also decreased hepatic triglyceride level without changing the liver weight. Perilla oil treatment increased the AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation and the lipolytic protein levels, whereas it decreased the lipogenic protein levels in the liver. In conclusion, perilla oil reduced serum cholesterol and arterial and hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD-fed mice.

Analyses were adjusted for maternal and childhood sociodemographic- and lifestyle-related characteristics.We observed that higher maternal total n-3 PUFA concentrations, and specifically those of eicosapentaenoic , docosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic , were associated with a lower childhood total-body fat percentage and a lower android:gynoid fat mass ratio (P< 0.05) but not with childhood BMI and the abdominal preperitoneal fat mass area. Higher maternal total n-6 PUFA concentrations, and specifically those of dihomo-γ-, were associated with a higher childhood total-body fat percentage, android:gynoid fat mass ratio, and abdominal preperitoneal fat mass area (P< 0.05) but not with childhood BMI. In line with these findings, a higher maternal n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio was associated with higher childhood total-body and abdominal fat mass.Lower maternal n-3 PUFA concentrations and higher n-6 PUFA concentrations during pregnancy are associated with higher body fat and abdominal fat in childhood.

Upon infection with the necrotroph Botrytis cinerea, several defence mechanisms are induced in P. patens, including the fortification of the plant cell wall by the incorporation of phenolic compounds and the induced expression of related genes. Botrytis cinerea infection also activates the accumulation of reactive  species and cell death with hallmarks of programmed cell death in moss tissues. Salicylic  (SA) levels also increase after fungal infection, and treatment with SA enhances transcript accumulation of the defence gene phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) in P. patens colonies. The expression levels of the genes involved in 12-oxo-phytodienoic  (OPDA) synthesis, including lipoxygenase (LOX) and allene oxide synthase (AOS), increase in P. patens gametophytes after pathogen assault, together with a rise in free  and OPDA concentrations. However, jasmonic  (JA) could not be detected in healthy or infected tissues of this plant. Our results suggest that, although conserved defence signals, such as SA and OPDA, are synthesized and are probably involved in the defence response of P. patens against B. cinerea infection, JA production appears to be missing. Interestingly, P. patens responds to OPDA and methyl jasmonate by reducing moss colony growth and rhizoid length, suggesting that jasmonate perception is present in mosses. Thus, P. patens can provide clues with regard to the evolution of different defence pathways in plants, including signalling and perception of OPDA and jasmonates in nonflowering and flowering plants.© 2012 THE AUTHORS.

Using cultured alveolar epithelial monolayers, we demonstrated that OA and some other fatty acids (< or = 50 microM) can induce permeability changes without detectable cellular damage. At higher concentrations, however, OA caused severe membrane damage and leakage to solute flux. The permeability enhancing effect of OA was observed with both the paracellular marker 3H-mannitol and the lipophilic transcellular indicator 14C-progesterone. While the effect of OA on transcellular permeability may be attributed to its known effect on membrane fluidity, the paracellular promoting effect of OA and its mechanism are not well established. We postulated that OA may increase paracellular permeability through a Ca(2+)-dependent  mechanism. Using dual-excitation fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated that OA can increase intracellular calcium, [Ca2+]i, in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was transient at low OA concentrations (< or = 50 microM) but became more pronounced and sustained at higher concentrations. Free hydroxyl and unsaturated groups were required for this activation since esterified OA (oleic methyl ester) and stearic  (a saturated fatty  with equal chain length) had much reduced effects on both the [Ca2+]i and the permeability alterations. Degree of unsaturation was unimportant since  (18:3), linoleic  (18:2), and OA (18:1) had similar and comparable effects on the two parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['tight junction']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31010974>Transdifferentiation of bovine epithelial towards adipocytes in the presence of myoepithelium.</a></h2><p>Orchastric changes in the mammary glands are vital, especially during the lactaction. The secretary epithelial cells together with the supporting myoepithelial and stromal cells function cordially to secrete milk.Increase in the number of luminal epithelial cells and a decrease in adipocytes are visible during lactation, whereas the reverse happens in the involution. However, an early involution occurs if the epithelial transdifferente towards adipocytes in lactation period. We aimed to inhibit the adipocyte transdifferentiation of luminal cells by restraining the PPARγ pathway.  (LA) and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) induced  in mammary epithelial cells were conducted in monolayer, mixed culture as well as in transwell plate co-culture with mammary myoepithelial cells.Co-culture with myoepithelial cells showed higher adipogenic gene expression in epithelial cells under LA+TZDs treatment. Increase in the expressions of PPARγ, C/EBPα and vimentin in both mRNA as well as protein levels were observed.Whereas,BADGE treatment blocked LA+TZDs induced , as it could not show a significant rise in adipose related markers. Although comparative results were found in both mixed culture and monolayer conditions, co-culture technic found to work better than the others. In summary, antagonizing PPARγ pathway in the presence of myoepithelial cells can significantly reduce the adipogenisis in epithelial cells, suggestingtherapeutic inhibition of PPARγ can be considered to counter early involution or excessive  in mammary epithelium in animals.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19131081>Physcomitrella patens has lipoxygenases for both eicosanoid and octadecanoid pathways.</a></h2><p>Mosses have substantial amounts of long chain C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic , in addition to the shorter chain C18  and linoleic acids, which are typical substrates of lipoxygenases in flowering plants.

ALA is an essential fatty  which cannot be produced within the human body and must be acquired through diet. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of a novel microalgal strain (HDMA-20) as a source of ω-3 PUFAs including ALA and eicosatetraenoic  (ETA, C20:4ω3).Phylogenetic Neighbor-Joining analysis based on 18S ribosomal DNA sequence was used to identify the microalga strain HDMA-20. Autotrophic condition was chosen to cultivate HDMA-20 to reduce the cultivation cost. GC-MS was used to determine the fatty  composition of HDMA-20 .A microalgal strain (HDMA-20) from Lake Chengfeng (Daqing, Heilongjiang province, China) was found to accumulate high content of ω-3 PUFAs (63.4% of total ), with ALA and eicosatetraenoic  (ETA, C20:4ω3) accounting for 35.4 and 9.6% of total , respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S ribosomal DNA sequences suggested that the HDMA-20 belonged to genus Monoraphidium (Selenastraceae, Sphaeropleales) and its 18S rDNA sequence information turned out to be new molecular record of Monoraphidium species. The biomass productivity and  content of HDMA-20 were also investigated under autotrophic condition. The biomass productivity of HDMA-20 reached 36.3 mg L day, and the  contents was 22.6% of dry weight.HDMA-20 not only represent an additional source of ALA, but also a totally new source of ETA. The high content of ω-3 PUFAs, especially ALA, of HDMA-20, makes it suitable as a source of nutrition supplements for human health. In addition, HDMA-20 exhibited good properties in growth and  accumulation, implying its potential for cost-effective ω-3 PUFAs production in future.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27914320>Biochemical precursor effects on the fatty  production in cell suspension cultures of Theobroma cacao L.</a></h2><p>Cocoa butter (CB) is composed of 96% palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and  fatty acids that are responsible for the hardness, texture and fusion properties of chocolate.

It was found that biotin stimulated fatty  synthesis without altering cell viability and cell growth. It was also evident a change in the lipid profile of cell suspensions, increasing middle and long chain fatty acids proportion, which are unusual to those reported in seeds; thus implying that it is possible to modify lipid profiles according to the treatment used.

AOS 13-HPOT (13-hydroperoxy-9,11,15-octadecatrienoic ) metabolizing activity assays assessed in various pearl millet cultivars with differential resistances against downy mildew revealed a positive correlation between cultivar resistance levels and AOS activities. Furthermore, the involvement of AOS in response to downy mildew was demonstrated by induction of AOS activity in both susceptible and resistant pearl millet cultivars during Sclerospora graminicola infection with higher induction observed in the resistant cultivar. Consistently, western blot analysis and tissue-blot immunoassay demonstrated the remarkable increase in AOS protein accumulation in the incompatible interaction. In addition, the tissue-blot immunoassay also showed the compartmentalization of AOS in the epidermis and vascular bundles of pearl millet seedlings. Expression analysis of a putative PgAOS1 gene revealed a marked difference in accumulation of PgAOS1 transcripts between contrasting plants, with pathogen-induced higher accumulation of the transcripts observed only in the resistant cultivar; a result which is in agreement with pathogen-induced AOS level and activity, indicating that PgAOS1 plays an important role in regulation of AOS level and activity in pearl millet upon S. graminicola infection. Our findings suggest an important role for AOS in regulation of responses to downy mildew disease in pearl millet. The differential AOS activities can potentially be used for selection of new disease-resistant pearl millet varieties, and the identified AOS-encoding gene(s) as genetic resource for development of enhanced downy mildew-resistant cultivars.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26806592>Interactions between dietary oil treatments and genetic variants modulate fatty  ethanolamides in plasma and body weight composition.</a></h2><p>Fatty  ethanolamides (FAE), a group of lipid mediators derived from long-chain fatty acids (FA), mediate biological activities including activation of cannabinoid receptors, stimulation of fat oxidation and regulation of satiety.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the response of six major circulating FAE to various dietary oil treatments in a five-period, cross-over, randomised, double-blind, clinical study in volunteers with abdominal . The treatment oils (60 g/12 552 kJ per d (60 g/3000 kcal per d)) provided for 30 d were as follows: conventional canola oil, high oleic canola oil, high oleic canola oil enriched with DHA, flax/safflower oil blend and corn/safflower oil blend. Two SNP associated with FAE degradation and synthesis were studied. Post-treatment results showed overall that plasma FAE levels were modulated by dietary FA and were positively correlated with corresponding plasma FA levels; minor allele (A) carriers of SNP rs324420 in gene fatty  amide hydrolase produced higher circulating oleoylethanolamide (OEA) (P=0·0209) and docosahexaenoylethanolamide (DHEA) levels (P=0·0002).

It is initiated by free  radical-induced abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the lipid molecule followed by a series of nonenzymatic reactions that ultimately generate the reactive aldehyde species 4-hydroxyalkenals. The molecule 4-hydroxy-2E-hexenal (4-HHE) is generated by peroxidation of n-3 PUFAs, such as , eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic . The aldehyde product 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (4-HNE) is the peroxidation product of n-6 PUFAs, such as arachidonic and linoleic acids and their 15-lipoxygenase metabolites, namely 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HpETE) and 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic  (13-HpODE). Another reactive peroxidation product is 4-hydroxy-2E,6Z-dodecadienal (4-HDDE), which is derived from 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic  (12-HpETE), the 12-lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic . Hydroxyalkenals, notably 4-HNE, have been implicated in various pathophysiological interactions due to their chemical reactivity and the formation of covalent adducts with macromolecules. The progressive accumulation of these adducts alters normal cell functions that can lead to cell death. The lipophilicity of these aldehydes positively correlates to their chemical reactivity. Nonetheless, at low and noncytotoxic concentrations, these molecules may function as signaling molecules in cells. This has been shown mostly for 4-HNE and to some extent for 4-HHE. The capacity of 4-HDDE to generate such "mixed signals" in cells has received less attention.

Thus, we estimated genetic parameters for muscle content of individual FA, and their relationships with  deposition traits, muscle pigmentation, sea lice and pancreas disease in slaughter-sized Atlantic salmon. Our aim was to evaluate the selection potential for increased n-3 LC-PUFA content and provide insight into FA  in Atlantic salmon muscle.Among the n-3 PUFA, proportional contents of  (ALA; 18:3n-3) and DHA had the highest heritability (0.26) and EPA the lowest (0.09). Genetic correlations of EPA and DHA proportions with muscle  differed considerably, 0.60 and 0.01, respectively. The genetic correlation of DHA proportion with visceral  was positive and high (0.61), whereas that of EPA proportion with lice density was negative. FA that are in close proximity along the bioconversion pathway showed positive correlations with each other, whereas the start (ALA) and end-point (DHA) of the pathway were negatively correlated (- 0.28), indicating active bioconversion of ALA to DHA in the muscle of fish fed high FO-diet.Since contents of individual FA in salmon muscle show additive genetic variation, changing FA composition by selective breeding is possible. Taken together, our results show that the heritabilities of individual n-3 LC-PUFA and their genetic correlations with other traits vary, which indicates that they play different roles in muscle , and that proportional muscle contents of EPA and DHA are linked to body  deposition. Thus, different selection strategies can be applied in order to increase the content of healthy omega-3 FAin the salmon muscle. We recommend selection for the proportion of EPA + DHA in the muscle because they are both essential FA and because such selection has no clear detrimental effects on other traits.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28398239>Genetic Risk Score of Nine Type 2  Risk Variants that Interact with Erythrocyte Phospholipid  for Type 2  in Chinese Hans: A Case-Control Study.</a></h2><p>Modulation of n-3 fatty acids on genetic susceptibility to type 2  (T2D) is still not clear.

Previously, it was suggested that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs): linoleic, α-, γ- (GLA), dihomo-GLA (DGLA), arachidonic (AA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) function as endogenous anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-parasitic, and immunomodulating agents. A variety of bacteria are sensitive to the growth inhibitory actions of LA and ALA . Hydrolyzed linseed oil can kill methicillin-resistant . Both LA and AA have the ability to inactivate herpes, influenza, Sendai, and Sindbis virus within minutes of contact. AA, EPA, and DHA induce death of  both  and . Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and prostaglandin A (PGA), derived from DGLA, AA, and EPA inhibit viral replication and show anti-viral activity. Oral mucosa, epidermal cells, lymphocytes and macrophages contain and release significant amounts of PUFAs on stimulation. PUFAs stimulate NADPH-dependent superoxide production by macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes to kill the invading microorganisms. Cytokines induce the release of PUFAs from cell membrane lipid pool, a potential mechanism for their antimicrobial action. AA, EPA, and DHA give rise to lipoxins (LXs), resolvins, protectins, and maresins that limit and resolve  and have antimicrobial actions. Thus, PUFAs and their metabolites have broad antimicrobial actions.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30279702>Analysis of Time-Series Gene Expression Data to Explore Mechanisms of Chemical-Induced Hepatic Steatosis Toxicity.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a wide spectrum of disease, ranging from simple fatty liver through steatosis with  and necrosis to cirrhosis. One of the most challenging problems in biomedical research and within the chemical industry is to understand the underlying mechanisms of complex disease, and complex adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). Based on a set of 28 steatotic chemicals with gene expression data measured on primary hepatocytes at three times (2, 8, and 24 h) and three doses (low, medium, and high), we identified genes and pathways, defined as molecular initiating events (MIEs) and key events (KEs) of steatosis using a combination of a time series and pathway analyses. Among the genes deregulated by these compounds, the study highlighted OSBPL9, ALDH7A1, MYADM, SLC51B, PRDX6, GPAT3, TMEM135, DLGDA5, BCO2, APO10LA, TSPAN6, NEURL1B, and DUSP1. Furthermore, pathway analysis indicated deregulation of pathways related to lipid accumulation, such as fat digestion and absorption, linoleic and  metabolism, calcium signaling pathway, fatty  metabolism, peroxisome, retinol metabolism, and steroid metabolic pathways in a time dependent manner. Such transcription profile analysis can help in the understanding of the steatosis evolution over time generated by chemical exposure.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29649233>Euglena gracilis growth and cell composition under different temperature, light and trophic conditions.</a></h2><p>Euglena gracilis, a photosynthetic protist, produces protein, unsaturated fatty acids, wax esters, and a unique β-1,3-glucan called paramylon, along with other valuable compounds. The cell composition of E. gracilis was investigated in this study to understand how light and organic carbon (photo-, mixo- and heterotrophic conditions) affected growth and cell composition (especially lipids). Comparisons were primarily carried out in cultures grown at 23 °C, but the effect of growth at higher temperatures (27 or 30 °C) was also considered.Specific growth rates were slightly lower when E. gracilis was grown on glucose in either heterotrophic or mixotrophic conditions than when grown photoautotrophically, although the duration of exponential growth was longer. Temperature determined the rate of exponential growth in all cultures, but not the linear growth rate during light-limited growth in phototrophic conditions. Temperature had less effect on cell composition.Although E. gracilis was not expected to store large amounts of paramylon when grown phototrophically, we observed that phototrophic cells could contain up to 50% paramylon. These cells contained up to 33% protein and less than 20% lipophilic compounds, as expected. The biomass contained about 8% fatty acids (measured as fatty  methyl esters), most of which were unsaturated. The fatty  content of cells grown in mixotrophic conditions was similar to that observed in phototrophic cells, but was lower in cells grown heterotrophically. Heterotrophic cells contained less unsaturated fatty acids than phototrophic or mixotrophic cells. α- was present at 5 to 18 mg g-1 dry biomass in cells grown in the presence of light, but at < 0.5 mg g-1 biomass in cells grown in the dark.

The aim of this review is to examine the effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation at reducing ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents. Medline, Cinahl+, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Embase were searched for trials investigating the effects of omega-3 supplementation in children and adolescents with ADHD. The primary outcome measure was a mean difference in Conners' rating scale (CRS) between the intervention and placebo group. Search terms used include ADHD, omega-3, fish oils, eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic acids,  and Conners' rating scale. Randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of omega-3 supplementation in children and adolescents as measured by CRS were included. Studies using a combination of polyunsaturated fatty acids or any other rating scale were excluded. Seven trials were included in this review, totalling 926 participants. We found no evidence of publication bias or heterogeneity between trials. Overall, there was a slightly greater reduction in CRS score in favour of the experiment group. One study found a greater reduction in score in favour of the placebo group. Neither findings were statistically significant. There is little supportive evidence to validate the claim of omega-3 supplementation to reduce the degree of ADHD symptoms experienced by children and adolescents.

First generation of rats born and maintained under supplementation with soybean-oil (SO), fish-oil (FO) or hydrogenated-vegetable-fat (HVF), which are rich in n-6, n-3 and trans (TFA) FA, respectively, until adulthood, were exposed to an amphetamine (AMPH)-induced mania animal model to behavioral and biochemical evaluations. While AMPH caused hyperlocomotion in HVF and, to a less extent, in SO- and FO-groups, a better memory performance was observed in FO group. Among vehicle-groups, HVF increased reactive species (RS) generation and protein-carbonyl (PC) levels in cortex; FO reduced RS generation in hippocampus and decreased PC levels in hippocampus and striatum. Among AMPH-treated animals, HVF exacerbated RS generation in all evaluated brain areas and increased PC levels in cortex and striatum; FO reduced RS generation in hippocampus and decreased PC levels in hippocampus and striatum. FO was related to higher percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) in cortex and striatum, while HVF was associated to higher incorporation of TFA in cortex, hippocampus and striatum, besides increased n-6/n-3 FA ratio in striatum. While a continuous exposure to TFA may intensify oxidative events in brain, a prolonged FO consumption may prevent mania-like-behavior; enhance memory besides decreasing brain oxidative markers. A substantial inclusion of processed foods, instead of foods rich in omega-3, in the long term is able to influence the functionality of brain structures related to behavioral disturbances and weaker neuroprotection, whose impact should be considered by food safety authorities and psychiatry experts.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

According to previous experiments, human milk fat is partially lost during continuous enteral nutrition. However, these experiments were done over relatively short infusion times, and a complete profile of the lost fatty acids was never measured. Whether this loss happens considering longer infusion times or if some fatty acids are lost more than others remain unknown. Pooled breast milk was infused through a feeding tube by a peristaltic pump over a period of 30 min and 4, 12 and 24 h at 2 mL/h. Adsorbed fat was extracted from the tubes, and the fatty  composition was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Total fat loss (average fatty  loss) after 24 h was 0.6 ± 0.1%. Total fat loss after 24 h infusion was 0.6 ± 0.1% of the total fat infused, although the highest losses occur in the first 30 min of infusion (13.0 ± 1.6%).

Here we exposed bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells and human platelets to variable glucose and fatty  concentrations. We then examined  consumption and acidification rates using recently available technology in the form of an extracellular  and proton flux analyzer. Acute or overnight exposure of confluent BAE cells to glucose concentrations from 5.5 to 25 mM did not enhance or change the rate of  consumption (OCR) under basal conditions, during ATP synthesis, or under uncoupled conditions. Glucose also did not alter OCR in sub-confluent cells, in cells exposed to low serum, or in cells treated with added pyruvate. Likewise, overnight exposure to fatty acids of varying saturation had no such effects. Overnight exposure of BAE cells to low glucose concentration decreased maximal uncoupled respiration, but not basal or ATP related  consumption. Labeled glucose oxidation to CO(2) increased, but only marginally after high glucose exposure while oleate oxidation to CO(2) decreased. Overnight exposure to , but not oleic or linoleic  increased extracellular acidification consistent with enhanced glycolytic metabolism. We were unable to detect an increase in production of reactive  species (ROS) from BAE cells exposed to high medium glucose. Like BAE cells, exposure of human platelets to glucose did not increase  consumption. As opposed to BAE cells, platelet mitochondria demonstrate less respiratory reserve capacity (beyond that needed for basal metabolism). Our data do not support the concept that exposure to high glucose or fatty acids accelerates mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in endothelial cells or platelets.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636691>Flaxseed oil ameliorated high--diet-induced bone loss in rats by promoting osteoblastic function in rat primary osteoblasts.</a></h2><p>α- (ALA) is a plant-derived omega-3 unsaturated fatty  that is rich in flaxseed oil (FO). The effect of FO on bone health is controversial. This study aims to evaluate the effect of FO on bone damage induced by a high- diet (HFD) and to explore the possible mechanism.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a normal control diet (NC, 10% ), FO diet (NY, 10% ), HFD (60% ), or HFD containing 10% FO (HY, 60% ) for 22 weeks. Micro CT and three-point bending tests were conducted to evaluate bone microstructure and biomechanics. Serum was collected for the detection of ALP, P1NP, and CTX-1. Rat primary osteoblasts (OBs) were treated with different concentrations of ALA with or without palmitic  (PA) treatment. The ALP activity, osteogenic-related gene and protein expression were measured.Rats in the HFD group displayed decreased biomechanical properties, such as maximum load, maximum fracture load, ultimate tensile strength, stiffness, energy absorption, and elastic modulus, compared with the NC group (   < 0.05). However, HY attenuated the HFD-induced decreases in bone biomechanical properties, including maximum load, maximum fracture load, and ultimate tensile strength ( < 0.05). Trabecular bone markers such as trabecular volume bone mineral density (Tb. vBMD trabecular bone volume/total volume (Tb. BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb. N), trabecular thickness (Tb.

However, cortical bone markers such as cortical volume bone mineral density (Ct. vBMD), cortical bone volume/total volume (Ct. BV/TV) and cortical bone thickness (Ct. Th) were not significantly different among all groups. Moreover, the serum bone formation markers ALP and P1NP were higher and the bone resorption marker CTX-1 was lower in the HY group compared with levels in the HFD group. Compared with the NC group, the NY group had no difference in the above indicators. In rat primary OBs, PA treatment significantly decreased ALP activity and osteogenic gene and protein (β-catenin, RUNX2, and osterix) expression, and ALA dose-dependently restored the inhibition induced by PA.FO might be a potential therapeutic agent for HFD-induced bone loss, most likely by promoting osteogenesis.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9175912>Gammalinolenic  and dihomogammalinolenic  suppress the CD3-mediated signal transduction pathway in human T cells.</a></h2><p>Gammalinolenic  (GLA; 18:3n6) and dihomogammalinolenic  (DGLA; 20:3n6) suppress lymphocyte activation, and GLA administration reduces joint swelling and tenderness in rheumatoid arthritis patients with active synovitis.

A series of pH-responsive lipid molecules were designed and synthesized for future liposomal formulation as a nano-drug delivery system for vancomycin at the infection site. The structures of these lipids differ from each other in respect of hydrocarbon tails: Lipid1, 2, 3 and 4 have stearic, oleic, linoleic, and  hydrocarbon chains, respectively. The impact of variation in the hydrocarbon chain in the lipid structure on drug encapsulation and release profile, as well as mode of drug interaction, was investigated using molecular modeling analyses. A wide range of computational tools, including accelerated molecular dynamics, normal molecular dynamics, binding free  calculations and principle component analysis, were applied to provide comprehensive insight into the interaction landscape between vancomycin and the designed lipid molecules. Interestingly, both MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA binding affinity calculations using normal molecular dynamics and accelerated molecular dynamics trajectories showed a very consistent trend, where the order of binding affinity towards vancomycin was lipid4 > lipid1 > lipid2 > lipid3. From both normal molecular dynamics and accelerated molecular dynamics, the interaction of lipid3 with vancomycin is demonstrated to be the weakest (∆G = -2.17 and -11.57, for normal molecular dynamics and accelerated molecular dynamics, respectively) when compared to other complexes. We believe that the degree of unsaturation of the hydrocarbon chain in the lipid molecules may impact on the overall conformational behavior, interaction mode and encapsulation (wrapping) of the lipid molecules around the vancomycin molecule. This thorough computational analysis prior to the experimental investigation is a valuable approach to guide for predicting the encapsulation ability, drug release and further development of novel liposome-based pH-responsive nano-drug delivery system with refined structural and chemical features of potential lipid molecule for formulation development.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9748638>Methylene-interrupted double bond in polyunsaturated fatty acid is an essential structure for  by the fatty acid chain elongation system of rat liver.</a></h2><p>Some plant oils contain non-methylene-interrupted polyunsaturated fatty acids (NMIFAs).

Challenges and opportunities.</a></h2><p>Growth in demand for foods with potentially beneficial effects on consumer health has motivated increased interest in developing strategies for improving the nutritional quality of ruminant-derived products. Manipulation of the rumen environment offers the opportunity to modify the lipid composition of milk and meat by changing the availability of fatty acids (FA) for mammary and intramuscular lipid uptake. Dietary supplementation with marine lipids, plant secondary compounds and direct-fed microbials has shown promising results. In this review, we have compiled information about their effects on the concentration of putative desirable FA (e.g. c9t11-CLA and vaccenic, oleic, linoleic and  acids) in ruminal digesta, milk and intramuscular fat. Marine lipids rich in very long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) efficiently inhibit the last step of C18 FA biohydrogenation (BH) in the bovine, ovine and caprine, increasing the outflow of t11-18:1 from the rumen and improving the concentration of c9t11-CLA in the final products, but increments in t10-18:1 are also often found due to shifts toward alternative BH pathways. Direct-fed microbials appear to favourably modify rumen lipid metabolism but information is still very limited, whereas a wide variety of plant secondary compounds, including tannins, polyphenol oxidase, essential oils, oxygenated FA and saponins, has been examined with varying success. For example, the effectiveness of tannins and essential oils is as yet controversial, with some studies showing no effects and others a positive impact on inhibiting the first step of BH of PUFA or, less commonly, the final step. Further investigation is required to unravel the causes of inconsistent results, which may be due to the diversity in active components, ruminant species, dosage, basal diet composition and time on treatments. Likewise, research must continue to address ways to mitigate negative side-effects of some supplements on animal performance (particularly, milk fat depression) and product quality (e.g. altered oxidative stability and shelf-life).</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'probiotics']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27169831>Dietary intake and adipose tissue content of α- and risk of myocardial infarction: a Danish cohort study.</a></h2><p>Intake of the plant-derived ω-3 (n-3) fatty  α- (ALA, 18:3; n-3) may reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, but the results of previous studies have been inconsistent.We aimed to investigate the association between dietary intake of ALA, adipose tissue content of ALA, and risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI).A total of 57,053 participants, aged 50-64 y, were enrolled in the prospective Danish cohort study Diet, Cancer and Health between 1993 and 1997.

Nevertheless, the physiological basis behind the extreme resistance of S. patens requires more detailed studies. In the present work, we aimed to study how membrane fatty  remodeling could contribute to the resistance of this plant to salt. Spartina patens individuals exposed to increasing levels of salinity and its leaf fatty  profile under  peroxidation products evaluated under all tested concentrations. A significant increase in the relative amounts of the saturated fatty acids (SFA) was observed, namely palmitic  (C16:0), essential for PS II functioning, and stearic (C18:0) . The chloroplastidial trans-hexadecenoic  (C16:1t) as well as the polyunsaturated linoleic (C18:2) and  (C18:3) acids showed significant decreases in all the salt treatments. These changes led to a reduction in the double bond index in salt-treated plants which reflects reduction of the fluidity of the chloroplast membranes, which could contribute to maintain the membrane impermeable to the toxic exogenous Na. Despite the decrease observed in the total fatty  contents in plants exposed to high salt concentrations the amounts of  peroxidation products decreased highlighting the resistance of this species towards toxic exogenous salt concentrations.

Previous researches have demonstrated that CLN can inhibit the growth of a wide variety of cancer cells, whereas the modulatory effect of CLN on various myeloid leukemia cells remains unclear. This study aims at demonstrating the in vitro anti-tumor effect and action mechanisms of jacaric , a CLN isomer which is present in jacaranda seed oil, on the murine macrophage-like leukemia PU5-1.8 cells.It was found that jacaric  inhibited the proliferation of PU5-1.8 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, as determined by the MTT reduction assay and by using CyQUANT(®) NF Cell Proliferation Assay Kit, while it exerted minimal cytotoxicity on normal murine cells. Besides, the reactive  species production in jacaric -treated PU5-1.8 cells was elevated in a concentration-dependent mannar. Flow cytometric analysis revealed the induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, accompanied by a decrease in CDK2 and cyclin E proteins. Jacaric  also triggered apoptosis as reflected by induction of DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax protein and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins.Our results demonstrated the growth-inhibitory effect of jacaric  on PU5-1.8 cells through inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, while exhibiting minimal cytotoxicity to normal murine cells. Therefore, jacaric  is a potential candidate for the treatment of some forms of myeloid leukemia with minimal toxicity and fewer side effects.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30170993>Identification of a functional FADS1 3'UTR variant associated with erythrocyte n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids levels.</a></h2><p>Blood polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) levels are determined by diet and by endogenous synthesis via Δ5- and Δ6-desaturases (encoded by the FADS1 and FADS2 genes, respectively). Genome-wide association studies have reported associations between FADS1-FADS2 polymorphisms and the plasma concentrations of PUFAs, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides. However, much remains unknown regarding the molecular mechanisms explaining how variants affect the function of FADS1-FADS2 genes.Here, we sought to identify the functional variant(s) within the FADS gene cluster.To address this question, we (1) genotyped individuals (n = 540) for the rs174547 polymorphism to confirm associations with PUFA levels used as surrogate estimates of desaturase activities and (2) examined the functionality of variants in linkage disequilibrium with rs174547 using bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays.The rs174547 minor allele was associated with higher erythrocyte levels of dihomo-γ- and lower levels of arachidonic , suggesting a lower Δ5-desaturase activity. In silico analyses suggested that rs174545 and rs174546, in perfect linkage disequilibrium with rs174547, might alter miRNA binding sites in the FADS1 3'UTR. In HuH7 and HepG2 cells transfected with FADS1 3'UTR luciferase vectors, the haplotype constructs bearing the rs174546T minor allele showed 30% less luciferase activity. This relative decrease reached 60% in the presence of miR-149-5p and was partly abolished by cotransfection with an miR-149-5p inhibitor.This study identifies FADS1 rs174546 as a functional variant that may explain the associations between FADS1-FADS2 polymorphisms and -related phenotypes.Copyright © 2018 National  Association.

In this study, 67 kinds of soybean cultivars were selected, and correlation analysis was conducted between physicochemical indexes of these soybean cultivars and flavor characteristic indexes of soymilk. With clustering analysis, all the soybean cultivars could be classified into three classes, and according to the results of principal component analysis for each class of soymilk flavor characteristics, the soymilk of second class had relatively heavier beany and non-beany flavor, and the third class had weaker flavor. For soybean cultivars of which the soymilk characteristics were unknown, two discriminant functions could be used to predict flavor characteristics if the physicochemical indexes were known. Therefore, screening of soybean cultivars suitable for soymilk processing can be targeted for the flavor favored by consumers and an evaluation method established.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Pyrosequencing was used to determine the effects of dietary lipid sources (FAs) on mtDNA methylation.Mitochondrial arginine transfer RNA and NAD(H) dehydrogenase 4L encoding region methylation in the liver was higher in the OO (9.5% ± 0.52%; P < 0.05) and PO (7.3% ± 0.33%; P < 0.05) groups than in the FO (5.9% ± 0.42%) group, whereas 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methylation in the liver was lower in the OO group (2.7% ± 0.22%) than in the FO group (4.2% ± 0.73%) (P < 0.05). Additionally, fish fed the OO diet had lower liver mRNA levels of ND3 (P < 0.05), ND4L (P < 0.05), ND6 (P < 0.05), 12S rRNA (P < 0.05), and 16S rRNA (P < 0.05) than those fed the FO diet, whereas fish fed the PO diet had lower liver mRNA levels of 16S rRNA than those fed the FO diet (P < 0.05).

Diets were supplemented with flaxseed and corn oil to achieve 4 dietary ratios of linoleic  to  [17:1 (control), 8:1, 4:1, or 2:1]. Each diet was fed to HyLine Brown or W-36 pullets from 1 d to 16 wk of age. Day-old pullets were randomly assigned to 8 replicate cages with 12 pullets per cage; the density was reduced to 8 pullets per cage at 11 wk of age. Dietary treatments did not affect body weight, feed consumption, or pullet mortality. At 12 wk of age, an interaction between diet and strain (P < or = 0.004) showed Hy-Line W-36 pullets fed the 2:1 ratio had greater antibody production against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine than those fed diets with higher ratios. At wk 16, pullets fed ratios of 4:1 and 2:1 had the greatest antibody production against NDV vaccine. Antibody production against infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) vaccine was also increased (P < 0.04) by ratios of 4:1 (2.244 optical density; OD) or 2:1 (2.508 OD) as compared with the control diet (1.576 OD). Hy-Line Brown pullets had greater antibody production against infectious bronchitis virus vaccine compared with Hy-Line W-36 pullets at 16 wk of age.

The results showed that, besides concentration, UFAs types could also influence fermentation process and volatiles in final wine. Low concentrations of UFAs (12 and 60 mg/L), especially LA and OA, significantly promoted fermentation activity and most volatiles when compared to the control, however, the effect became the inhibition with increasing concentrations of UFAs (120 and 240 mg/L). It was interesting to find that OA addition (12 and 60 mg/L) could generate more acetate esters (especially isoamyl acetate) in wine, while 12 mg/L LA facilitated more   formation (octanoic  and decanoic ). In comparison, 120 and 240 mg/L ALA produced more amount of C6 alcohols (1-hexanol) and higher alcohols (isobutyl alcohol and 2,3-butanediol). UFAs additions were unfavorable for ethyl esters formation, except for an increment of ethyl hexanoate in 12 mg/L OA wine. As a result, different aromatic profiles of wines were generated by variations of UFAs types and levels, as shown by PCA. The transcriptional data revealed that the expressions of aroma-related genes, such as , , , , , , , ,  and  were correlated with aroma compounds productions in different treatments. Our data suggested that the three UFAs have different enological functions and they could generate different aromatic profiles. Thus, besides concentrations, it is essential to consider the types of UFAs when applying the strategy to adjust UFAs contents to modulate the aromatic quality of wines.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29983135>Effects of whole linseed supplementation and treatment duration on fatty  profile and endogenous bioactive compounds of beef muscle.</a></h2><p>Diet supplementation with oilseeds is known to improve the fatty  profile of meat, but few studies have been carried out to determine the time required for the incorporation of a significant quantity of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into meat from steers. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the effects of linseed supplementation and feeding duration on the fatty  profile, cholesterol and bioactive compounds of bovine meat. In total, 54 Friesian steers were randomly allocated during the finishing period into six experimental treatments following a 2×3 factorial design. The six treatments consisted of two diets, the control diet (CO) with no supplemental  and the linseed diet (LS) containing 10% whole linseed, fed 40, 75 or 120 days before slaughter. At the end of each finishing period, steers from the CO and LS groups were slaughtered. After 8 days of ageing chemical analysis, the fatty  profile, cholesterol content and bioactive compounds were determined from the longissimus thoracis muscle. Including linseed in the diet increased the content of monounsaturated fatty acids, CLA and n-3 PUFA, and reduced the proportion of saturated fatty acids and n-6 PUFA. The percentage of myristic fatty  increased with the duration of feeding, regardless of diet and a decrease in PUFA and n-6 PUFA was observed in the CO and LS diets, respectively. Furthermore, meat from steers fed linseed showed an increased percentage of n-3 PUFA, , and EPA from 40 to 75 days of feeding, whereas vaccenic , CLA 9c,11t, and total CLA increased from 40 and 75 days but declined at 120 days. Beef from the linseed group had a higher content of bioactive substances such as creatine, carnosine and anserine than beef from the control group. The duration of feeding significantly affected the creatine concentrations, with an increase in the LS group from 40 to 75 days of feeding. Feeding linseed did not modify the cholesterol content, on average and the lowest cholesterol content was found in meat after 75 days of linseed administration. This study demonstrates that a short-term diet manipulation is sufficient to improve the nutritional properties of meat, including n-3 PUFA and bioactive compounds.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14729912>A plasma membrane protein from Zea mays binds with the herbivore elicitor volicitin.</a></h2><p>Volicitin (17-hydroxylinolenoyl-l-Gln) present in the regurgitant of Spodoptera exigua (beet armyworm caterpillars) activates the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when in contact with damaged Zea mays cv Delprim (maize) leaves. VOC emissions in turn serve as a signaling defense for the plant by attracting female parasitic wasps that prey on herbivore larvae. A tritiated form of volicitin was synthesized and shown to induce volatiles in the same fashion as the biological form. [(3)H]-l-volicitin rapidly, reversibly, and saturably bound to enriched plasma membrane fractions isolated from Z. mays leaves with an apparent K(d) of 1.3 nM and a Hill coefficient of 1.07. Analog studies showed that the l-Gln and hydroxy moieties of volicitin play an important role in binding. Treatment of plants with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) increased the total binding of [(3)H]-l-volicitin to the enriched plasma membrane more than threefold, suggesting that MeJA activates transcription of the gene encoding the binding protein. S. exigua feeding also increased total binding fourfold. Cycloheximide pretreatment of plants significantly decreased binding of radiolabeled volicitin to the enriched plasma membrane.

To determine why consumption of ω-3 fatty  is associated with lower risk of CVD, we investigated the biological functions of ω-6 (linoleic ) and ω-3 () in reconstituted HDL (rHDL) after encapsulation using human cells and zebrafish embryo. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the principal protein behind the beneficial functions of HDL, which include potent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-atherosclerotic activities in blood. Several rHDLs were synthesized with apoA-I and different molar ratio of ω-6 or ω-3 fatty . Both fatty acids showed similar solubility in rHDL up to a molar ratio of 95:5:1:10 (palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol:apoA-I:fatty ). Although both rHDL showed similar structural properties and α-helical contents, ω-6-rHDL showed loss of anti-oxidant ability against LDL oxidation. Uptake of acetylated LDL into macrophages was inhibited by ω-3-rHDL but not ω-6-rHDL, suggesting that ω-6-rHDL has higher pro-atherosclerotic activity. ω-3-rHDL showed more enhanced cholesterol efflux activity with less accumulation of triglyceride in the macrophage. ω-6-rHDL caused more senescence in human dermal fibroblast cells with cytotoxicity, while ω-3-rHDL treatment inhibited the senescence. In zebrafish embryo survivability, ω-3-rHDL-injected embryos showed 86±3% survival, whereas ω-6-rHDL-injected ones showed 72±2% survival as well as an elevated inflammatory response in zebrafish embryos. In conclusion, ω-6-rHDL and ω-3-rHDL show different physiological activities in atherosclerosis, inflammation, and cellular senescence.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The role of CL and its metabolism in plants are less well understood. The measurement of CL in plants, including its molecular species composition, is hampered by the fact that CL is of extremely low abundance, and that plants contain large amounts of interfering compounds including galactolipids, neutral lipids, and pigments. We used solid phase extraction by anion exchange chromatography to purify CL from crude plant lipid extracts. LC/MS was used to determine the content and molecular species composition of CL. Thus, up to 23 different molecular species of CL were detected in different plant species, including Arabidopsis, mung bean, spinach, barley, and tobacco. Similar to animals, plant CL is dominated by highly unsaturated species, mostly containing linoleic and .

Over 50% of fatty acids in Arabidopsis () seed oil have a cis-double bond on an even-numbered carbon. Degradation of these substrates requires peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation plus additional enzyme activities. Such auxiliary enzymes, including the enoyl-CoA hydratase ECH2, convert (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates to the core β-oxidation substrate (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. ECH2 was suggested to function in the peroxisomal conversion of indole-3-butyric  (IBA) to indole-3-acetic , because  seedlings have altered IBA responses. The underlying mechanism connecting ECH2 activity and IBA  is unclear. Here, we show that  seedlings have reduced root length, smaller cotyledons, and arrested pavement cell expansion. At the cellular level, reduced oil body mobilization and enlarged peroxisomes suggest compromised β-oxidation.  seedlings accumulate 3-hydroxyoctenoate (C8:1-OH) and 3-hydroxyoctanoate (C8:0-OH), putative hydrolysis products of catabolic intermediates for α- and linoleic , respectively. Wild-type seedlings treated with 3-hydroxyoctanoate have like growth defects and altered IBA responses.  phenotypes are not rescued by Suc or auxin application. However,  phenotypes are suppressed in combination with the core β-oxidation mutants  or , and  seedlings accumulate less C8:1-OH and C8:0-OH than  seedlings. These results indicate that  phenotypes require efficient core β-oxidation. Our findings suggest that low ECH2 activity causes metabolic alterations through a toxic effect of the accumulating intermediates. These effects manifest in altered  and IBA responses leading to disrupted seedling development.© 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the major site of acyl editing, which is catalyzed by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT), an integral membrane protein that plays a major role in supplying oleate to the PC pool for further unsaturation. Our investigations using mass spectrometric analysis of leaf microsomal fractions identified LPCAT as part of a membrane protein complex. Both native and recombinant LPCAT showed strong acyltransferase activity with various acyl-CoA substrates. Altogether, the results suggest that ALA-rich glycerolipid biosynthetic machinery is highly active in nutritionally important Portulaca leaves. Furthermore, lipidome, transcriptome, and mass spectrometric analyses of RR04 provide novel information for exploring Portulaca as a potential resource and a model system for studying leaf .</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25083105>Seamustard (Undaria pinnatifida) Improves Growth, , Fatty  Profile and Reduces Cholesterol in Hanwoo Steers.</a></h2><p>The study was designed to evaluate the effect of 2% seamustard (Undaria pinnatifida) by-product (SW) on growth performance, , carcass characteristics, cholesterol content and fatty  profile in Hanwoo steers. A total of 20 Hanwoo steers (ave. 22 months old; 619 kg body weight) were randomly assigned to control (basal diet) and 2% SW supplemented diet. Dietary SW supplementation significantly (p<0.05) improved average daily gain and gain:feed ratio as well as serum immunoglobulin G concentration. Chemical composition and quality grade of meat and carcass yield grades evaluated at the end of the trial were found to be unaffected by SW supplementation. Dietary SW significantly reduced meat cholesterol concentration (p<0.05). Dietary SW supplementation significantly reduced the myristic  (C14:0) and palmitoleic  (C16:ln-7) concentration, while SW increased the concentration of stearic  (C18:0) and  (C18:3n-3) compared to control (p<0.05).

However, there have been few studies in humans. Therefore, we elected to investigate the effects of a variety of EFA [gamma- (GLA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)] in vitro on human blood lymphocyte reactivity, cytokine secretion and natural cytotoxicity. The proliferative response to polyclonal mitogens (phytohaemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, concanavalin A), as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized lymphocytes, was inhibited (P < 0.05) by all EFAs tested, in a dose-dependent manner (3-15 micrograms/ml). The greatest inhibition of proliferation was caused by EPA and DHA. Similarly, EPA, DHA and GLA significantly reduced cytotoxic activity [expressed as lytic units, using 51 chromium-release assays natural killer (NK) (K562 cells) and lymphokine-activated (LAK) (Daudi cells) cells] (P < 0.05) in a concentration-dependent manner (5-50 micrograms/ml), without affecting cell viability. EPA and DHA exhibited greater suppression than GLA. Furthermore, the inhibition of cell proliferation and suppression of natural cytotoxicity was associated with marked decrease in cytokine [interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)] production in vitro.

Little attention has been given to the effects of these feeds on the essential fatty  status of children with SAM. The objective of this study was to describe changes in the PUFA composition in whole blood in children with SAM during treatment and to determine predictors of change. This prospective study took place in a paediatric nutrition rehabilitation unit in Kampala, Uganda, and assessed whole-blood fatty  composition of children with SAM at admission, transition, discharge and follow-up (8 and 16 weeks). ANCOVA was used to identify predictors of change in whole-blood PUFA. The study included 120 children with SAM and twenty-nine healthy control children of similar age and sex.

When challenged with the fungus Botrytis, resistance of the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant was reduced when compared with the aos mutant, suggesting that TFAs play a role in cell survival independently of being the precursors of JA. An independent genetic approach using the lesion mimic mutant accelerated cell death2 (acd2-2) confirmed the importance of TFAs in containing lesion spread, which was increased in the lines in which the fad3 fad7 fad8 and acd2-2 mutations were combined when compared with the aos acd2-2 lines. Malondialdehyde, found to result from oxidative TFA fragmentation during lesion formation, was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Its levels correlated with the survival of the tissue.

Whereas both genes were up-regulated under low  conditions, only HpFAD3 transcription was repressed by an excess of C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3, while the HpFAD2 transcript level did not significantly change.

Rchb.f.</a></h2><p>Coleostephus myconis (L.) Rchb.f. (Asteraceae) is a highly disseminated plant species with ruderal and persistent growth. Owing to its advantageous agronomic properties, C. myconis might have industrial applications. However, this species needs to be comprehensively characterized before any potential use. In a previous study, the phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of different C. myconis tissues were characterized. This investigation was extended to examine the cytotoxic potential of selected plant tissues (flowers and green parts) using a HepG2 cell line by utilizing the lysosomal neutral red uptake assay or mitochondrial (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. In addition, the macronutrients content, lipophilic compounds (fatty acids, tocopherols), and amino acids were also determined. C. myconis flowers were used in the senescence stage, which was previously identified as the stage that presented maximal phenolic content and highest antioxidant activity. In contrast, stems and leaves were employed due to their high biomass proportion. Regarding cytotoxicity, mitochondrial and lysosomal damage was only significant when HepG2 cells were exposed to the highest extract concentrations (stems and leaves, 0.9 mg/ml; senescent flowers, 0.3 mg/ml). Chemically, the senescent flowers were mostly characterized by their high levels of fat, amino acids (especially threonine), oleic , β-, and γ-tocopherol, while stems and leaves contained high concentrations of carbohydrates, , and α-tocopherol. In general, these results provide information regarding the threshold concentrations of C. myconis extracts that might be used in different applications without toxicity hazards.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10319914>Inhibition of angiogenic factor- and tumour-induced angiogenesis by gamma .</a></h2><p>Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is an essential feature of malignant tumour development. Gamma  (GLA), a n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), inhibits the growth and metastasis of a variety of tumour cells, including breast, prostate, pancreatic cancer and hepatoma cells and also has anti-metastatic effects on endothelial cells. In the current study, we tested whether GLA inhibited angiogenesis induced by tumour cells. A rat aortic ring assay and in vitro tube formation of human vascular endothelial cells were used to determine angiogenesis (spontaneous, angiogenic factor- and tumour cells-induced). Inclusion of GLA in this 3-D matrix culture system significantly inhibited angiogenesis from aortic rings in a concentration-dependent manner. The results from tube formation of vascular endothelial cell further confirmed that GLA suppressed angiogenesis. Furthermore, in the cell motility assay (phagokinetic assay and endothelial wounding assay), a significant reduction of the motility of vascular endothelial cells by GLA was seen. It is concluded that gamma  inhibits angiogenic factor and tumour-induced angiogenesis in vitro at least in part via its inhibitory effect on the motility of vascular endothelial cells.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26745305>Strategies for incorporation of chia (Salvia hispanica L.) in frankfurters as a health-promoting ingredient.</a></h2><p>Different strategies were examined for incorporation of chia flour (10%) and olive oil to improve the fat content in frankfurters.

Conjugated fatty acids (CFA), namely isomers of linoleic and  (i.e. CLA and CLNA, respectively) can positively modulate inflammation processes and energy metabolism, promoting anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant effects, improved lipid profiles and insulin resistance, among others. Bioactive doses have been indicated to be above 1 g/d, yet these cannot be achieved through a moderate intake (i.e. 1-2 servings) of natural sources, and certain CLA-containing products have limited commercial availability. Such handicaps have fueled research interest in finding alternative fortification strategies. In recent years, screening of dairy products for CFA-producing bacteria has attracted much attention and has led to the identification of some promising strains, including Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 702258. This strain has shown interesting producing capabilities in model systems as well as positive modulation of lipid metabolism activities in animal studies. Accordingly, the aim of this research work was to assay B. breve NCIMB 702258 in semi-skimmed milk to produce a probiotic fermented dairy product enriched in bioactive CLA and CLNA. The effect of substrates (LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA) on growth performance and membrane fatty acids profile was also studied, as these potential modifications have been associated to stress response. When tested in cys-MRS culture medium, LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA impaired the fatty  synthesis by B. breve since membrane concentrations for stearic and oleic acids decreased. Variations in the C18:1 c11 and lactobacillic  concentrations, may suggest that these substrates are also affecting the membrane fluidity. Bifidobacterium breve CFA production capacity was first assessed in cys-MRS with LA, α-LNA, γ-LNA or all substrates together at 0.5 mg/mL each. This strain did not produce CFA from γ-LNA, but converted 31.12% of LA and 68.20% of α-LNA into CLA and CLNA, respectively, after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. In a second phase, B. breve was inoculated in a commercial semi-skimmed milk with LA, α-LNA or both at 0.5 mg/mL each. Bifidobacterium breve revealed a limited capacity to synthesize CLA isomers, but was able to produce 0.062-0.115 mg/mL CLNA after 24 h at 37 °C. However, organoleptic problems were reported which need to be addressed in future studies. These results show that although CFA were produced at too low concentrations to be able to achieve solely the bioactive dose in one daily portion size, fermented dairy products are a suitable vector to deliver B. breve NCIMB 702258.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism', 'inflammation', 'insulin resistance', 'probiotics']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25153536>Serum metabolites from walnut-fed aged rats attenuate stress-induced neurotoxicity in BV-2 microglial cells.</a></h2><p>The shift in equilibrium towards excess reactive  or nitrogen species production from innate antioxidant defenses in brain is a critical factor in the declining neural function and cognitive deficit accompanying age. Previous studies from our laboratory have reported that walnuts, rich in polyphenols, antioxidants, and omega fatty acids such as  and linoleic , improve the age-associated declines in cognition and neural function in rats. Possible mechanisms of action of these effects include enhancing protective signaling, altering membrane microstructures, decreasing inflammation, and preventing accumulation of polyubiquitinated protein aggregates in critical regions of the brain. In the current study, we investigated whether the serum collected from aged animals fed with walnut diets (0, 6, and 9%, w/w) would enhance protection on stressed BV-2 microglia in vitro. In the growth medium, fetal bovine serum was substituted with the serum collected from 22-month-old rats fed per protocol for 12 weeks. Walnut diet serum (6 and 9%) significantly attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced nitrite release compared to untreated control cells and those treated with serum from rats fed 0% walnut diets. The results also indicated a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase.

This work investigated the effect of substituting fresh-cut grass with increasing quantities of fresh-cut white clover (WC) on milk fatty  (FA) profile and transfer efficiency of dietary linoleic (LA) and α- (ALNA) acids to milk . Three groups of three crossbred dairy cows were used in a 3 × 3 crossover design. Dietary treatments were 0 g kg WC + 600 g kg grass, 200 g kg WC + 400 g kg grass, and 400 g kg WC + 200 g kg grass. All treatments were supplemented with 400 g kg concentrates on a dry matter basis.

Both diets significantly decreased the percentage of T cells (except 1.3% EPA + DHA), T helper cells (except 1.3% EPA + DHA and 3.5% ALA), and T suppressor cells. Proliferative response of lymphocytes to T cell mitogens significantly increased after the diet containing 3.3% EPA + DHA. Interleukin 2 production significantly increased after the diets containing 1.3% and 3.3% EPA + DHA. No significant changes in mitogenic response or interleukin 2 production were found after ALA diets. Feeding 1.3% or 3.3% EPA + DHA or 5.3% ALA significantly suppressed prostaglandin E2 production in response to T cell mitogens. Plasma tocopherol concentrations were decreased significantly only in monkeys fed ALA diets. We conclude that after adjustment for the tocopherol concentration, marine-derived n-3 PUFAs but not plant-derived n-3 PUFAs increased T cell-mediated mitogenic response and interleukin 2 production.

Results show that: (a) the hearts of SRD-fed rats display lipotoxicity suggesting impaired myocardial lipid utilization; (b) Compared with the SRD group, dietary chia normalizes blood pressure; reverses/improves heart lipotoxicity, glucose oxidation, the increased protein mass level of FAT/CD36, and the impaired  stimulated FAT/CD36 translocation to the plasma membrane. The enhanced M-CPT1 activity is markedly reduced without similar changes in protein mass. PPARα slightly decreases, while the UCP2 protein level remains unchanged in all groups. Normalization of dyslipidemia and IR by chia reduces plasma fatty acids (FAs) availability, suggesting that a different milieu prevents the robust translocation of FAT/CD36. This could reduce the influx of FAs, decreasing the elevated M-CPT1 activity and lipid storage and improving glucose oxidation in cardiac muscles of SRD-fed rats.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26836731>Association of Seafood Consumption, Brain Mercury Level, and APOE ε4 Status With Brain Neuropathology in Older Adults.</a></h2><p>Seafood consumption is promoted for its many health benefits even though its contamination by mercury, a known neurotoxin, is a growing concern.To determine whether seafood consumption is correlated with increased brain mercury levels and also whether seafood consumption or brain mercury levels are correlated with brain neuropathologies.Cross-sectional analyses of deceased participants in the Memory and Aging Project clinical neuropathological cohort study, 2004-2013.

The results showed that the initial addition of a high level of UFAs can significantly enrich the intracellular UFAs when compared to a low addition of UFAs and further increase the cell population and most volatiles, including higher alcohols and esters, except for several fatty acids. Microarray analyses identified that 63 genes were upregulated, and 91 genes were downregulated during the different fermentation stages. The up-regulated genes were involved in yeast growth and proliferation, stress responses and amino  transportation, while the repressed genes were associated with  and sterol biosynthesis, amino  , TCA cycle regulation, mitochondrial respiration, and stress responses. Unexpectedly, the genes directly related to the biosynthesis of volatile compounds did not vary substantially between the fermentations with the high and low UFA additions. The beneficial aromatic function of the UFAs was ascribed to the increased biomass and amino  transportation, considering that the incorporation of the additional UFAs in yeast cells maintains high membrane fluidity and increases the ability of the cells to resist deleterious conditions. Our results highlighted the importance of UFAs in the regulation of aroma biosynthesis during wine fermentation and suggested that the improvement of the resistance of yeast to extreme stresses during alcoholic fermentation is essential to effectively modulate and improve the production of aroma compounds.

Flaxseed, flax oil, and FLC had variable effects on BP in humans, while SDG and FPH significantly reduced the BP in SDR and SHR. The effect of SDG was dose-dependent and long lasting. The lowering of BP is mediated through inhibition of soluble epoxide by  - in flax oil, stimulation of guanylate cyclase and inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by SDG, and inhibition of renin and ACE activity by FPH. Flaxseed, flax oil, and FLC have variable effects on BP (none, slight, and significant). They are effective in lowering BP in individuals with hypertension and  but ineffective in healthy individuals' ineffectiveness of flaxseed and its compounds in lowering BP may be due to their low doses, long interval of dosing, short duration of consumption, and patient status.

Pure SDG and FPS may serve as therapeutic agents for the treatment of hypertension but they have not been tried in humans.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26629547>Circulating Unsaturated Fatty Acids Delineate the Metabolic Status of Obese Individuals.</a></h2><p> is not a homogeneous condition across individuals since about 25-40% of obese individuals can maintain healthy status with no apparent signs of metabolic complications. The simple anthropometric measure of body mass index does not always reflect the biological effects of excessive body fat on health, thus additional molecular characterizations of obese phenotypes are needed to assess the risk of developing subsequent metabolic conditions at an individual level.To better understand the associations of free fatty acids (FFAs) with metabolic phenotypes of , we applied a targeted metabolomics approach to measure 40 serum FFAs from 452 individuals who participated in four independent studies, using an ultra-performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a Xevo G2 quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometer.FFA levels were significantly elevated in overweight/obese subjects with diabetes compared to their healthy counterparts. We identified a group of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) that are closely correlated with metabolic status in two groups of obese individuals who underwent weight loss intervention and can predict the recurrence of diabetes at two years after metabolic surgery. Two UFAs, dihomo-gamma- and palmitoleic , were also able to predict the future development of metabolic syndrome (MS) in a group of obese subjects.These findings underscore the potential role of UFAs in the MS pathogenesis and also as important markers in predicting the risk of developing diabetes in obese individuals or diabetes remission after a metabolic surgery.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'insulin resistance', 'lipogenesis', 'metabolic syndrome', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2913961>Implications of dietary oils and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the management of cutaneous disorders.</a></h2><p>A major proinflammatory metabolite of arachidonic , leukotriene B4, is known to accumulate in the lesions of . Most of this metabolite is biosynthesized by the polymorphonuclear cells that infiltrate into the psoriatic lesions. Epidermal 15-lipoxygenase, on the other hand, metabolizes arachidonic  into 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-20:4n-6), presumably serving as a negative feedback to inhibit the local generation of leukotriene B4. Eicosapentaenoic , a major polyunsaturated fatty  in fish oil, and gamma-, a poly-unsaturated fatty  in certain vegetable oils, are both metabolized by epidermal 15-lipoxygenase into 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic  (15-OH-20:5n-3) and 15-hydroxyeicosatriaenoic  (15-OH-20:3n-3), respectively. Both of these monohydroxy acids are potent in vitro inhibitors of leukotriene B4 generation.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been shown to have cardio-protective effects in numerous pathological situations. It is not known whether rapeseed oil, which contains α- (ALA), has a similar protective effect. Omega-3 PUFAs are sensitive to attack by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and  peroxidation products could damage cardiac cells. We thus tested whether dietary refined rapeseed oil (RSO) associated with or without different antioxidants (vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and canolol) is cardio-protective in a situation of abdominal obesity.Sixty male Wistar rats were subdivided into 5 groups. Each group was fed a specific diet for 11 weeks: a low- diet (3% of lipids, C diet) with compositionally-balanced PUFAs; a high- diet rich in palm oil (30% of lipids, PS diet); the PS diet in which 40% of lipids were replaced by RSO (R diet); the R diet supplemented with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and vitamin E (RTC diet); and the RTC diet supplemented with canolol (RTCC diet). At the end of the diet period, the rats were sacrificed and the heart was collected and immediately frozen. Fatty  composition of cardiac phospholipids was then determined. Several features of cardiac function (fibrosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, , mitochondrial biogenesis) were also estimated.Abdominal obesity reduced cardiac oxidative stress and apoptosis rate by increasing the proportion of arachidonic  (AA) in membrane phospholipids. Dietary RSO had the same effect, though it normalized the proportion of AA. Adding vitamin E and CoQ10 in the RSO-rich high  diet had a deleterious effect, increasing fibrosis by increasing angiotensin-2 receptor-1b (Ag2R-1b) mRNA expression. Overexpression of these receptors triggers coronary vasoconstriction, which probably induced ischemia. Canolol supplementation counteracted this deleterious effect by reducing coronary vasoconstriction.Canolol was found to counteract the fibrotic effects of vitamin E + CoQ10 on cardiac fibrosis in the context of a high- diet enriched with RSO. This effect occurred through a restoration of cardiac Ag2R-1b mRNA expression and decreased ischemia.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'inflammation', 'obesity', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036858>Transcriptome analysis reveals the effects of grafting on sugar and α- metabolisms in fruits of cucumber with two different rootstocks.</a></h2><p>Flavor quality in cucumber is affected by different rootstocks, but the molecular mechanism is largely unclean.

There are several types of hair loss that differ in causes, symptoms, and spatial and temporal progression. Androgenic alopecia, a common form of hair loss, is the consequence of a decreased microcirculation of the scalp as well as the toxic action of elevated dihydrotestosterone levels on the hair bulbs. In the present study, the lotions TRINOV Lozione Anticaduta Uomo and TRINOV Lozione Anticaduta Donna, containing dihomo-γ- (DGLA), S-equol, and propionyl-l-carnitine, were tested on 30 men and 30 women (mean age of men was 46.6 ± 6.4 years; mean age of women was 49.5 ± 9.0) with signs of androgenic alopecia, respectively. DGLA is a precursor of the prostaglandin PGE1, which acts by improving microcirculation; S-equol inhibits 5α-reductases, thus preventing the transformation of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone; and propionyl-l-carnitine promotes , stimulating energy production. These three molecules are loaded into liposomes for their effective transdermal delivery. Daily topical applications of the lotions resulted in a hair count that significantly increased for women and marginally increased for men after 6 months of treatment. Furthermore, significant increase in anagen hair and a significant decrease in telogen hair were observed starting from 3 months in male and 1 month in female patients.

However, whether LqhIT2 induces insect resistance in rice, and how the LqhIT2 influences the biochemical metabolism of rice plants remains unknown. Here, purified LqhIT2-GST fusion protein had toxicity to rice leafrollers.

Introducing LqhIT2 primed the elevated expression of lipoxygenase, a key component of the jasmonic  biosynthetic pathway, together with enhanced , cis-(+)-12-oxophytodienoic , jasmonic , and jasmonic -isoleucine levels. In addition, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, a key gene of the phenylpropanoid pathway, was up-regulated.

Temporary effects of both scavengers could be detected, in particular NAC seemed to have temporary significant positive effects on endothelial tube formation in 100μM SM-exposed EBs. ALA augmented proliferation when administered after 30μM SM exposure on day 3, whereas NAC treatment on day 0 decreased apoptosis induced by 100μM SM. Taken together, our findings pointed to a negative effect of SM on vascularization and endothelial tube formation. ROS scavengers NAC and ALA showed temporary, but not long-lasting, rescuing effects regarding endothelial tube formation after SM exposure.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26751601>Influence of weight reduction on blood levels of C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and oxylipins in obese subjects.</a></h2><p> is associated with inflammation and weight reduction has been shown to influence the inflammatory process. Besides classic inflammatory markers, oxidized polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) metabolites (oxylipins) are potent mediators of inflammation. Little is known about endogenous levels of oxylipins, e.g. hydroxy, epoxy and dihydroxy FA in obese subjects with persistent low-grade inflammation. We aimed to evaluate levels of inflammatory markers and blood oxylipins in obese subjects before and after weight reduction.In the present study, 42 obese (BMI 32.7 ± 0.22 kg/m(2)) men and women were classified in groups according to high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels (no inflammation<1mg/L; low-grade inflammation ≥ 3 mg/L). Subjects underwent an intervention for eight weeks, which consisted of two phases: (1) week 1 and 2: total replacement of three meals by a formula diet and (2) six week partial formula diet (replacement of 1-2 meals). Blood samples were taken prior and post intervention for analysis of plasma protein levels of hsCRP, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Plasma Levels of free (unesterified) hydroxy, epoxy, and dihydroxy FAs as well as several prostanoids were analyzed in plasma by means of LC-MS-based targeted metabolomics.At baseline subjects with low-grade inflammation (hsCRP 8.95 ± 1.39 mg/L) showed significant higher levels of IL-6 (22.7 ± 1.15 ng/L) and TNF-α (17.4 ± 0.75 ng/L) compared to subjects with no inflammation (hsCRP: 0.69 ± 0.05 mg/L; IL-6: 15.9 ± 1.18 ng/L; TNF-α: 14.6 ± 0.80 ng/L). In both group's body weight was significantly reduced (p<0.001) after intervention (no inflammation group: -7.19 ± 0.86 kg, -7.3 ± 0.89%, p<0.001; low-grade inflammation group: -6.78 ± 0.87 kg, -6.7 ± 0.81%, p<0.001). Moreover, we observed significant decreases in levels of hsCRP (4.66 ± 0.64 mg/L; p=0.006), IL-6 (6.81 ± 1.15 ng/L; p<0.001) and TNF-α (6.09 ± 0.47 ng/L; p<0.001) in subjects with low-grade inflammation. Of 60 quantified oxylipins, 11 linoleic  (LA)-, 1 dihomo-γ- (DGLA)-, 7  (ALA)-, 15 arachidonic  (AA)-, 8 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)- and 18 docosahexaenoic  (DHA)-metabolites could be detected in plasma. For most oxylipins no differences were found between the low and high hsCRP groups before and after weight reduction. Interestingly, in subjects with low- grade inflammation several AA-derived oxylipins (5-, 8-, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETE)) were significantly higher compared to subjects with no inflammation before weight reduction and significantly reduced after weight reduction.Even moderate weight loss in obese subjects correlates to a significant improvement in the inflammatory state, by reducing hsCRP, IL-6, TNF-α and few oxylipins. The biological consequences of these changes remain to be further investigated.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

PLA concentrates were prepared from free FA (FFA) obtained from pine nut oil using solvent fractionation. Siberian pine nut oil containing 18.3 wt% PLA was used as the starting material for the fractionation. The fractionation was performed in n-hexane at ultra-low temperatures down to -85°C. The PLA concentrates produced under the optimal conditions established in this study (temperature, -85°C; n-hexane-to-FFA ratio (v/w), 30:1; fractionation time, 36 h) contained 69.8 wt% PLA. The yield of PLA was 77.4 wt% of the initial PLA  in the FFA. These results suggest that solvent fractionation is a more effective approach to prepare PLA concentrates with higher PLA contents at a particular yield of PLA than published methods using urea crystallization (e.g., PLA content = ~47 wt%, yield of PLA = ~77 wt%, Woo et al.

Yet their composition at the individual droplet level and how it evolves over time in living cells is essentially unknown due to the lack of suitable quantitative nondestructive measurement techniques. In this work, we demonstrate the ability of label-free hyperspectral coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, together with a quantitative image analysis algorithm developed by us, to quantify the lipid type and content in vol/vol concentration units of individual lipid droplets in living human adipose-derived stem cells during differentiation over 9 days in media supplemented with different fatty acids. Specifically, we investigated the addition of the polyunsaturated linoleic and  fatty acids into the normal differentiation medium (mostly containing monounsaturated fatty acids). We observe a heterogeneous uptake which is droplet-size dependent, time dependent, and lipid dependent. Cells grown in linoleic--supplemented medium show the largest distribution of lipid content across different droplets at all times during differentiation. When analyzing the average lipid content, we find that adding linoleic or  fatty acids at day 0 results in uptake of the new lipid components with an exponential time constant of 22 ± 2 h. Conversely, switching lipids at day 3 results in an exponential time constant of 60 ± 5 h.

These variations in magnitude may be directly ascribed to differences in the channeling of lipids toward oxidation or storage. A study was designed to compare the effects of 4 dietary fats on postprandial energy expenditure and on some risk factors of the metabolic syndrome. To avoid usual confounding factors due to simultaneous variations in chain length and double-bounds number of fatty acids, dietary fats were chosen to provide mainly 18-carbon fatty acids with 0 (stearic  [SA]), 1 (oleic  [OA]), 2 (linoleic  [LA]), or 3 ( [ALA]) double bounds. They were given as single high-fat test meals to 4 different groups of male rats. The resting metabolic rate and the lipid and carbohydrate oxidation were measured from  consumption and carbon dioxide production using indirect calorimetry 2 hours before and 6.5 hours after the test meal. Plasma glucose, triglyceride, and chylomicron concentrations were determined at 0, 1.5, and 4 hours after the test meal. Postprandial concentration of glucose and triglyceride did not vary with the nature of the test meals, whereas that of chylomicrons was the highest after the LA test meal and the lowest after the SA test meal. Postprandial increase in resting metabolic rate was the highest after the LA and OA test meals, and the lowest after the SA and ALA test meals. Compared with the 3 other diets, the ALA test meal enhanced lipid oxidation and decreased glucose oxidation during the early postprandial period (0.25-3.25 hours). This suggests that stearic  may not induce all the adverse effects classically described for other saturated fatty acids and that  may beneficially influence energy partitioning, especially during the early postprandial state.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Adipose tissue (AT) mRNA expression of chemokines (MCP-1, Fetuin-A, CXCL14), marker genes for M1 and M2 macrophages (CD11c and CD206, respectively) and inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, TLR-2, TLR-4, IL-10, GPR120) were measured along with activation of NFκB, JNK, and STAT-3. Macrophage infiltration into AT was examined using F4/80 immunohistochemistry.Any therapeutic benefit produced by reducing the omega-6:omega-3 was evident only when comparing the 1∶1 to 20∶1 HFD; the 1∶1 HFD resulted in a lower TC:HDL-C and decreased AT CXCL14 gene expression and AT macrophage infiltration, which was linked to a higher EPA:AA and DHA:AA in AT phospholipids.

One of the ways that plant defenses are triggered is via elicitors from insect oral secretions (OS). In this study, we investigated the ability of second-instar (L2) spruce budworm [SBW; Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens)] to alter the  organic compounds (VOCs) of four conifer species [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., Picea mariana (Miller) B.S.P., Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, Picea rubens (Sargent)] and found that the emission profiles from all host trees were drastically changed after herbivory. We then investigated whether some of the main elicitors (  conjugates [FACs], β-glucosidase, and glucose oxidase) studied were present in SBW OS. FACs (glutamine and glutamic ) based on , linoleic, oleic, and stearic  were all observed in varying relative quantities. Hydroxylated FACs, such as volicitin, were not observed. Enzyme activity for β-glucosidase was also measured and found present in SBW OS, whereas glucose oxidase activity was not found in the SBW labial glands. These results demonstrate that SBW L2 larvae have the ability to induce VOC emissions upon herbivory and that SBW OS contain potential elicitors to induce these defensive responses. These data will be useful to further evaluate whether these elicitors can separately induce the production of specific VOCs and to investigate whether and how these emissions benefit the plant.© Crown copyright 2015.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8485269>A randomized controlled study of evening primrose oil and fish oil in ulcerative .</a></h2><p>In a placebo-controlled study, 43 patients with stable ulcerative  were randomized to receive either MaxEPA (n = 16), super evening primrose oil (n = 19), or olive oil as placebo (n = 8) for 6 months, in addition to their usual treatment.

Chemical similarity between arsenate and phosphate (P) indicates possible antagonism between them in uptake and transportation. However, there is little study to reveal the interaction of As and P at transcriptional level. In this study RNA-sequencing was conducted on the two barley genotypes differing in As tolerance. A total of 2942 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were inclusively expressed in both genotypes under As (100 μM) and As (100 μM) + P (50 μM), and these DEGs included hormonal signaling, stress responsive, transport related and transcription factors. P addition in the culture solution inhibited the KEGG pathways related to ABC transporters, ether ,  , endocytosis and RNA transport. ZDB160 had a higher expression of DEGs associated with hormone signaling, secondary metabolites and stress defense under P conditions compared to ZDB475, which might explain its tolerance mechanism to As under P condition. The abscisic , jasmonic  and salicylic  signaling pathways were also significantly regulated under As + P conditions, which may also account for genotypic differences. Finally we drew up a hypothetical model of high As + P stress tolerance mechanism in ZDB160. It may be concluded that ZDB160 achieves its tolerance to As under P by up-regulating P transporters, resulting in more P uptake and less As translocation. The identified candidate genes related to As + P tolerance may provide insights into understanding As tolerance under limited P conditions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We hypothesize that elevated pretransplant free fatty acids (FFA) levels may be associated with prolonged survival of kidney transplants.Archived pretransplant sera of 130 patients who received a kidney transplant from 1991 to 1997 were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography for a comprehensive FFA profile. FFA levels were categorized by quartiles, and the association between quartiles of the levels for each free-fatty  and graft survival was initially screened by serial univariate analyses (Kaplan-Meier). All significant variables (FFAs and transplant-specific risk factors) were entered into a multivariable (Cox regression) model.With > 10 y of follow-up, 68 kidney allografts were lost. Factors associated with decreased graft survival by univariate analysis included delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR), and cold ischemic time (CIT) > 24 h. High levels of arachidonic and γ- FFA were associated with higher graft survival rates. By multivariate analysis, only DGF, AR, CIT, and arachidonic  levels were significant. The odds ratios for graft failure for the highest, third, and second quartiles of the pretransplant level of arachidonic , compared with the lowest quartile, were 0.18, 0.32, and 0.64, respectively (P = 0.050, log-rank test). For arachidonic  the survival benefit appeared to be graded with the highest quartile associated with a greater than 80% reduction of risk of kidney graft failure.Pretransplant level of arachidonic  was independently associated with higher kidney graft survival rates. Further studies are necessary to identify the underlying mechanisms and to determine whether interventions aimed at increasing pretransplant arachidonic  levels might prove beneficial for renal transplant outcomes.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We used 100 μM of n-6 PUFAs including arachidonic , linoleic , and gamma- and n-3 PUFAs including , eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). Only DHA significantly induced OSGIN1 protein and mRNA expression. DHA triggered reactive  species (ROS) generation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, suppressed DHA-induced OSGIN1 protein expression and nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. Nrf2 knockdown attenuated DHA-induced OSGIN1 expression. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine, a ROS scavenger, abrogated the DHA-induced increases in Akt phosphorylation, Nrf2 nuclear accumulation, and OSGIN1 expression. DHA induced the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, mitochondrial accumulation of OSGIN1 and p53, and cytochrome c release; knockdown of OSGIN1 diminished these effects. In conclusion, induction of OSGIN1 by DHA is at least partially associated with increased ROS production, which activates PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling.

Similarly, oxylipins derived from the ω-6 fatty  linoleic  generally have more adverse than beneficial cardiovascular effects. Alternatively, most oxylipins derived from 20- and 22-carbon ω-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory, antiaggregatory, and vasodilatory effects that help explain the cardioprotective effects of these fatty acids. Much less is known regarding the oxylipins derived from the 18-carbon ω-3 fatty  α-, but clinical trials with flaxseed supplementation have indicated that these oxylipins can have positive effects on blood pressure. Normal aging also is associated with changes in oxylipin levels in the brain, vasculature, and other tissues, indicating that oxylipin changes with aging may be involved in age-related changes in these tissues. A small number of trials in humans and animals with interventions that contain either 18-carbon or 20- and 22-carbon ω-3 fatty acids have indicated that dietary-induced changes in oxylipins may be beneficial in slowing the changes associated with normal aging. In summary, oxylipins are an important group of molecules amenable to dietary manipulation to target cardiovascular disease and age-related degeneration. Oxylipins are an important group of fatty  metabolites amenable to dietary manipulation. Because of the role they play in cardiovascular disease and in age-related degeneration, oxylipins are gaining recognition as viable targets for specific dietary interventions focused on manipulating oxylipin composition to control these biological processes.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity', 'inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28450497>Integrating 3-omics data analyze rat lung tissue of COPD states and medical intervention by delineation of molecular and pathway alterations.</a></h2><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a serious health problem. However, the molecular pathogenesis of COPD remains unknown. Here, we explored the molecular effects of cigarette smoke and bacterial infection in lung tissues of COPD rats. We also investigated therapeutic effects of aminophylline (APL) on the COPD rats and integrated transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome data for a global view of molecular mechanisms of COPD progression. Using molecular function and pathway analyses, the genes and proteins regulated in COPD and APL-treated rats were mainly attributed to oxidoreductase, antioxidant activity, energy and fatty  metabolism. Furthermore, we identified hub proteins such as Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), Pkm (pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2), and Sod1 (superoxide dismutase 1), included in energy metabolism and oxidative stress. Then, we identified the significantly regulated metabolic pathways in lung tissues of COPD- and APL-treated rats, such as arachidonic , linoleic , and α- metabolism, which belong to the lipid metabolism. In particular, we picked the arachidonic  metabolism for a more detailed pathway analysis of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. We could observe an increase in metabolites and genes involved in arachidonic  metabolism in COPD rats and the decrease in these in APL-treated rats, suggesting that inflammatory responses were up-regulated in COPD rats and down-regulated in APL-treated rats. In conclusion, these system-wide results suggested that COPD progression and its treatment might be associated with oxidative stress, lipid and energy metabolism disturbance. Additionally, we demonstrated the power of integrated omics for the elucidation of genes, proteins, and metabolites' changes and disorders that were associated with COPD.© 2017 The Author(s).</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29746616>A regulatory insertion-deletion polymorphism in the FADS gene cluster influences PUFA and lipid profiles among Chinese adults: a population-based study.</a></h2><p>Arachidonic  (AA) is the major polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) substrate for potent eicosanoid signaling to modulate  and thrombosis and is controlled in part by tissue abundance. Fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1) catalyzes synthesis of omega-6 (n-3) AA and n-3 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). The rs66698963 polymorphism, a 22-base pair (bp) insertion-deletion 137 bp downstream of a sterol regulatory element in FADS2 intron 1, mediates expression of FADS1 in vitro, as well as exerting positive selection in several human populations. The associations between the polymorphism rs66698963 and plasma PUFAs as well as disease phenotypes are unclear.This study aimed to evaluate the relation between rs66698963 genotypes and plasma PUFA concentrations and blood lipid profiles.Plasma fatty acids were measured from a single sample obtained at baseline in 1504 healthy Chinese adults aged between 35 and 59 y with the use of gas chromatography. Blood lipids were measured at baseline and a second time at the 18-mo follow-up. The rs66698963 genotype was determined by using agarose gel electrophoresis. Linear regression and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between genotype and plasma PUFAs and blood lipids.A shift from the precursors linoleic  and α- to produce AA and EPA, respectively, was observed, consistent with FADS1 activity increasing in the order of genotypes D/D to I/D to I/I. For I/I compared with D/D carriers, plasma concentrations of n-6 AA and the ratio of AA to n-3 EPA plus docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were 57% and 32% higher, respectively. Carriers of the deletion (D) allele of rs66698963 tended to have higher triglycerides (β = 0.018; SE: 0.009; P = 0.05) and lower HDL cholesterol (β = -0.008; SE: 0.004; P = 0.02) than carriers of the insertion (I) allele.The rs66698963 genotype is significantly associated with AA concentrations and AA to EPA+DHA ratio, reflecting basal risk of inflammatory and related chronic disease phenotypes, and is correlated with the risk of dyslipidemia.

Omega-3 fatty acids have been great source in suppressing . We investigated the effect of α- (ALA) on RANKL-stimulated osteoclast differentiation, LPS-induced and ovariectomized bone loss in mice models. MATERIAL AND METHODS The bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were isolated from femurs of ICR mice, stimulated with RANKL, and treated with ALA (100, 200, 300 µM). Major analytical methods include histological analysis, osteoclasts viability assay, serum cytokines and chemokines ELISA, and gene expression by qPCR. RESULTS ALA intervention inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclasts proliferation and differentiation. ALA inhibited bone resorption activity as measured by materialization of F-actin ring structures as well. ALA suppressed the RANKL-induced osteoclast markers c-Fos, c-Jun and NFATc1 together with transcription factor proteins TRAP, OSCAR, cathepsin K and β3-integrin. ALA also suppressed the RANKL-stimulated phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and AKT as well as NF-κB and BCL-2 proteins. ALA intervention (100 and 300 mg/kg) to LPS-challenged mice showed annulled morphometric changes induced by LPS by suppressing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. ALA (100 and 300 mg/kg) intervention to estrogen-deficiency induced bone loss mice (ovariectomized) showed reductions in TRAP+ osteoclasts count, CTX-I expression, levels of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL10, TNF-α and MCP-1 and iNOS and COX-2. CONCLUSIONS ALA suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and prevents inflammatory bone loss via downregulation of NF-κB-iNOS-COX-2 signaling.

We investigated both the independent and combined effects of exercise training and ALA consumption in obese Zucker rats, aiming to determine the potential for additive improvements in cardiovascular function. ALA and exercise training independently improved cardiac output, end-diastolic volume, left ventricular fibrosis and mean blood pressure following a 4 week intervention. Combining ALA and endurance exercise yielded greater improvements in these parameters, independent of changes in markers of oxidative stress or endogenous anti-oxidants. We postulate that divergent mechanisms of action may explain these changes: ALA increases peripheral vasodilation, and exercise training stimulates angiogenesis.Although α- (ALA) and endurance exercise training independently attenuate hyperlipidaemia-related cardiovascular derangements, there is a paucity of information pertaining to their mechanisms of action and efficacy when combined as a preventative therapeutic approach. Therefore, we used obese Zucker rats to investigate the independent and combined effects of these interventions on cardiovascular disease. Specifically, animals were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: control diet-sedentary, ALA supplemented-sedentary, control diet-exercise trained or ALA supplemented-exercise trained. Following a 4 week intervention, although the independent and combined effects of ALA and exercise reduced (P < 0.05) the serum free/esterified cholesterol ratio, only the ALA supplemented-exercise trained animals displayed a reduction in the content of both serum free and esterified cholesterol. Moreover, although ALA and endurance training individually increased cardiac output, stroke volume and end-diastolic volume, as well as reduced left ventricle fibrosis, mean blood pressure and total peripheral resistance, these responses were all greater following the combined intervention (ALA supplemented-exercise trained). These effects occurred independent of changes in oxidative phosphorylation proteins, markers of oxidative stress or endogenous anti-oxidant capacity. We propose that the beneficial effects of a combined intervention occur as a result of divergent mechanisms of action elicited by ALA and endurance exercise because only exercise training increased the capillary content in the left ventricle and skeletal muscle, and tended to decrease protein carbonylation in the left ventricle (P = 0.06). Taken together, our data indicate that combining ALA and endurance exercise provides additional improvements in cardiovascular disease risk reduction compared to singular interventions in the obese Zucker rat.© 2017 The Authors.

Subgroup analysis revealed that increasing dietary ALA tends to elevate CRP concentration in healthy subjects. However, the null effect of ALA supplementation on other inflammatory markers was not changed in various subgroups, indicating that the results are stable.

Regulation of lipid metabolism is crucial in the improvement of type 2 diabetes and  associated symptoms. The role of CaMKII in membrane associated lipid metabolism was the focus of this study. Five to six weeks old male Wistar rats were used in this study. GC×GC-TOFMS technique was used to determine the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic , arachidonic  and 11,14-eicosadienoic ). Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (Cpt-1) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc-1) genes expression were assessed using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). From the results, CaMKII activation by exercise increased the levels of arachidonic  and 11,14-eicosadienoic  while a decrease in the level of  was observed in the skeletal muscle. The results indicated that exercise-induced CaMKII activation increased CPT-1 expression and decreased ACC-1 expression in rat skeletal muscle.

However, little is known about the mechanism of this protection. We assessed the cellular and molecular mechanisms of dietary ALA (flaxseed) on atherosclerosis in a mouse model.Eight-week-old male apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE(-/-)) mice were fed a 0.21 % (w/w) cholesterol diet for 16 weeks containing either a high ALA [7.3 % (w/w); n = 10] or low ALA content [0.03 % (w/w); n = 10]. Bioavailability, chain elongation, and fatty  metabolism were measured by gas chromatography of tissue lysates and urine. Plaques were assessed using immunohistochemistry. T cell proliferation was investigated in primary murine CD3-positive lymphocytes. T cell differentiation and activation was assessed by expression analyses of interferon-γ, interleukin-4, and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) using quantitative PCR and ELISA. Dietary ALA increased aortic tissue levels of ALA as well as of the n-3 long chain fatty acids (LC n-3 FA) eicosapentaenoic , docosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic . The high ALA diet reduced plaque area by 50% and decreased plaque T cell content as well as expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and TNFα. Both dietary ALA and direct ALA exposure restricted T cell proliferation, differentiation, and inflammatory activity. Dietary ALA shifted prostaglandin and isoprostane formation towards 3-series compounds, potentially contributing to the atheroprotective effects of ALA.Dietary ALA diminishes experimental atherogenesis and restricts T cell-driven inflammation, thus providing the proof-of-principle that plant-derived ALA may provide a valuable alternative to marine LC n-3 FA.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9792636>Identification of Delta5-desaturase from Mortierella alpina by heterologous expression in Bakers' yeast and canola.</a></h2><p>A DNA fragment with homology to Delta6-desaturases from borage and cyanobacteria was isolated after polymerase chain reaction amplification of Mortierella alpina cDNA with oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the conserved regions of known Delta6-desaturase genes.

The conventional standard for FA composition analysis of HM is liquid extraction, trans-methylation, and analyte detection resolved by gas chromatography. This standard approach requires fresh or frozen samples, storage in deep freeze, organic solvents, and specialized equipment in processing and analysis. Further, HM collection is often impractical for many studies in the free living environment, particularly for studies in developing countries. In the present study, we compare a novel and more practical approach to sample collection and processing that involves the spotting and drying ~50 μL of HM on a specialized paper stored and transported at ambient temperatures until analysis. Deming regression indicated the two methods aligned very well for all LC-PUFA and the abundant HM FA. Additionally, strong correlations (r > 0.85) were observed for DHA, ARA, EPA, linoleic (LA), and  acids (ALA), which are of particular interest to the health of the developing infant.

Their effects as regulators of lipid and glucose metabolism are well documented. They also appear to affect protein metabolism, especially by acting on  sensitivity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of n-3 PUFA, i.e. the precursor α- (ALA) 18:3n-3 or long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA), in chickens, by focusing on their potential function as co-regulators of the  anabolic signalling cascade. Ross male broilers were divided into six dietary treatment groups. Diets were isoproteic (22 % crude protein) and isoenergetic (12·54 MJ metabolisable energy/kg) and contained similar lipid levels (6 %) provided by different proportions of various lipid sources: oleic sunflower oil rich in 18:1n-9 as control; fish oil rich in LC-PUFA; rapeseed and linseed oils providing ALA. The provision of diets enriched with n-3 PUFA, i.e. rich in LC-PUFA or in the precursor ALA, for 3 weeks improved the growth performance of chickens, whereas that of only the ALA diet enhanced the development of the pectoralis major muscle. At 23 d of age, we studied the  sensitivity of the pectoralis major muscle and liver of chickens after an intravenous injection of  or saline. The present results indicate that the activation patterns of n-3 PUFA are different in the liver and muscles. An ALA-enriched diet may improve  sensitivity in muscles, with greater activation of the -induced 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase/ribosomal protein S6 pathway involved in the translation of mRNA into proteins, thereby potentially increasing muscle protein synthesis and growth.

Palmitic and oleic VLDL (>80% total VLDL) are not converted in low density lipoproteins (LDL). Atherosclerosis is not an alimentary deficiency of polyenic fatty acids (PFA), but results from low in vivo bioavailability of PFA in LDL against the background of high dietary palmitic FA and palmitic LDL. Plasma PFA content and cellular PFA deficiency are as high as LDL cholesterol (CL). Primary prevention of atherosclerosis should be based on a decrease in dietary content of palmitic saturated FA, trans FA and a moderate increase in PFA. It seems highly unlikely that the xeobiotics statins, fibrates and probucol produce pleiotropic biological effects in vivo. These effects are brought about by phylogenetically early humoral mediators eicosanoids: prostacyclins, prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and resolvins.

In this study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used as the in vitro model and the potential beneficial effects of well-characterized flaxseed oil and ALA were studied. Exposure of HUVECs to LPS for 24 h significantly promoted inflammatory response as release of interleukin 6 (IL-6), soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1) as well as adhesion of THP-1 monocytes, but did not induce cytotoxicity or oxidative stress. ALA, but not flaxseed oil, significantly reduced LPS-induced release of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1, without effect on THP-1 adhesion. No radical scavenging activity was observed after flaxseed oil or ALA exposure. Rather, ALA at high concentrations promoted intracellular superoxide associated with damages to lysosomes, which was not observed in flaxseed oil exposed cells.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are used in rheumatoid arthritis to inhibit cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase), thereby decreasing production of 2-series PGs. Lipoxygenase activity remains intact, however, allowing LT production (eg, synthesis of LTB(4), a potent inflammatory mediator) to continue. Altering the essential fatty  (EFA) content of the diet can modify some of these effects. Ingestion of a diet rich in evening primrose oil elevates concentrations of dihomo-gamma- (DGLA; 20:3n-6), which results in the production of 1-series PGs, eg, PGE(1). DGLA itself cannot be converted to LTs but can form a 15-hydroxyl derivative that blocks the transformation of arachidonic  to LTs. Increasing DGLA intake may allow DGLA to act as a competitive inhibitor of 2-series PGs and 4-series LTs and thus suppress inflammation. The results of in vitro and animal work evaluating EFAs in inflammatory situations are encouraging, which has stimulated clinical workers to evaluate these compounds in rheumatoid arthritis. Several well-controlled, randomized clinical studies have now been completed in which various EFAs were evaluated as treatments. The results of most of these studies suggest some clinical benefit to these treatments; these data are reviewed here.</p><p>Keyword:['psoriasis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15771229>Vitamin D3-based conjugates for topical treatment of : synthesis, antiproliferative activity, and cutaneous penetration studies.</a></h2><p>The goals of the experiments reported in this paper were to explore skin bioavailability and cell growth inhibitory activity of new vitamin D3-based conjugates studied as a potential drug complex for .Conjugation was made between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as  or gamma-, and calcipotriol--a vitamin D3 analogue clinically used for topical treatment of . These complexes were prepared by coupling the corresponding fatty  with calcipotriol in the presence of dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide (DCC) and 4-(dimethylamino)-pyridine (DMAP) to obtain an ester bond.The conjugates were capable of enhancing the penetration of the vitamin into the skin as well as inhibiting proliferation of keratinocytes in cultures. The antiproliferative activity even increased after simulating the full hydrolysis of the conjugates. In vitro skin penetration studies revealed that the conjugates penetrated into the skin at higher levels relative to calcipotriol alone. It was also demonstrated that the conjugate containing n-3 fatty  penetrated into the skin at higher levels as compared to the conjugate containing n-6 PUFA. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis has shown that after penetration, a major portion of calcipotriol-PUFA conjugate was first converted mainly into another isomer form, presumably by transesterification, and only then it was hydrolyzed to form apparently high local concentrations of both calcipotriol and PUFA.The unique biotransformation that occurred after penetration into the skin indicates that these conjugates are mutual prodrugs that are able to be bioprocessed in the skin and fully converted to the parent therapeutic agents.</p><p>Keyword:['psoriasis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22913587>A non-canonical caleosin from Arabidopsis efficiently epoxidizes physiological unsaturated fatty acids with complete stereoselectivity.</a></h2><p>In plants, epoxygenated fatty acids (EFAs) are constituents of oil seeds as well as defence molecules and components of biopolymers (cutin, suberin). While the pleiotropic biological activities of mammalian EFAs have been well documented, there is a paucity of information on the physiological relevance of plant EFAs and their biosynthesis. Potential candidates for EFA formation are caleosin-type peroxygenases which catalyze the epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in the presence of hydroperoxides as co-oxidants. However, the caleosins characterized so far, which are mostly localized in seeds, are poor epoxidases. In sharp contrast, quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that PXG4, a class II caleosin gene, is expressed in roots, stems, leaves and flowers of Arabidopsis. Expressed in yeast, PXG4 encodes a calcium-dependent membrane-associated hemoprotein able to catalyze typical peroxygenase reactions. Moreover, we show here that purified recombinant PXG4 is an efficient fatty  epoxygenase, catalyzing the oxidation of cis double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids. Physiological linoleic and  acids proved to be the preferred substrates for PXG4; they are oxidized into the different positional isomers of the monoepoxides and into diepoxides. An important regioselectivity was observed; the C-12,13 double bond of these unsaturated fatty acids being the least favored unsaturation epoxidized by PXG4,  preferentially yielded the 9,10-15,16-diepoxide. Remarkably, PXG4 catalyzes exclusively the formation of (R),(S)-epoxide enantiomers, which is the absolute stereochemistry of the epoxides found in planta. These findings pave the way for the study of the functional role of EFAs and caleosins in plants.© 2012 The Authors Journal compilation © 2012 FEBS.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28795377>Comparison of the fatty  profile of Spanish infant formulas and Galician women breast milk.</a></h2><p>The importance of dietary lipids during childhood is evident, as they are necessary for correct growth and development of the newborn. When breastfeeding is not possible, infant formulas are designed to mimic human milk as much as possible to fulfill infant's requirements. However, the composition of these dairy products is relatively constant, while human milk is not a uniform bio-fluid and changes according to the requirements of the baby. In this study, breast milk samples were donated by 24 Spanish mothers in different lactation stages and different infant formulas were purchased in supermarkets and pharmacies. Gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detection was used for the fatty  determination. Compared to breast milk, first-stage formulas are apparently very similar in composition; however, no major differences were observed in the fatty  profiles between formulas of different lactation stages. The Galician women breast milk has a fatty  profile rich in oleic , linoleic , arachidonic , and docosahexaenoic . When comparing human milk with formulas, it becomes evident that the manufacturers tend to enrich the formulas with essential fatty acids (especially with α-), but arachidonic and docosahexaenoic  levels are lower than in breast milk. Additionally, the obtained results demonstrated that after 1 year of lactation, human milk is still a good source of , essential fatty acids, and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids for the baby.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29298969>[Dietetary recommendation for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease].</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common chronic liver disease in the developed world. Nowadays, in the adult population of Europe it is estimated at 14% to 21%. Its most important risk factors are  and metabolic syndrome. Introducing lifestyle changes such as: dietary intervention and increased physical activity are the first-line treatment and are intended to support not only NAFLD but also associated diseases such as , insulin resistance, diabetes and dyslipidemia. Dietary management focuses on weight reduction of overweight or obese people by decreasing energy in diet. It is recommended to limit the intake of saturated fats and trans fatty acids as well as cholesterol. Instead, it is important to increase the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty  diets, mainly from the n-3 family, which exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. It is also beneficial to eat nuts, despite their high energy value, as a source of , which lowers LDL cholesterol. It is important to increase the share of vegetable protein (eg. soya) and limit the intake of fat meat, milk and the dairy products. A key role in the treatment and prevention of NAFLD is also a reduction of simple sugars and total exclusion of added sugar in the diet. The rise of NAFLD in developed countries is analogous to the increase of fructose consumption, which high intake is directly indicated as the main cause of the disease. Choosing foods with high fiber content, low glycemic index and meals composed with low glycemic load, is conducive to weight reduction. An important role in supporting NAFLD treatment is also attributed to vitamin D, C and E supplementation and some probiotic bacteria, as well as cinnamon and turmeric, which improve insulin sensitivity. Daily physical activity is strongly recommended as the supplement of healthy lifestyle.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'energy', 'insulin resistance', 'metabolic syndrome', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21046125>Unsaturated fatty acids repress the expression of adipocyte fatty  binding protein via the modulation of histone deacetylation in RAW 264.7 macrophages.</a></h2><p>Adipocyte fatty  binding protein (A-FABP) present in macrophages has been implicated in the integration of lipid metabolism and inflammatory response, contributing to development of  and atherosclerosis.This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the role of fatty acids in the inflammatory pathways is mediated through the modulation of A-FABP expression in macrophages.Murine RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with inflammatory insults and fatty acids for quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. The cells were treated with trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, for elucidating mechanisms for the regulation of A-FABP expression by fatty acids. RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down A-FABP was utilized to assess its role in inflammatory gene expression.When RAW 264.7 were incubated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS; 100 ng/ml) or 2.5 ng/ml of tumor necrosis factor α for 18 h, A-FABP mRNA and protein levels were drastically increased. Unsaturated fatty acids (100 μmol/l in complexed with BSA) such as palmitoleic , oleic , linoleic , , and eicosapentaenoic , significantly repressed the basal as well as LPS-induced A-FABP expression, whereas palmitic  did not elicit the same effect. TSA increased A-FABP mRNA levels and abolished the repressive effect of linoleic  on A-FABP expression in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated macrophages. Depletion of A-FABP expression by 70-80% using RNAi markedly decreased cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA abundance and potentiated the repression by linoleic .Unsaturated fatty acids inhibited the basal as well as LPS-induced A-FABP expression.

Nutritional interventions such as adjuvant strategy for preventing these conditions are recently gaining increasing attention. Ingestion of n3-polyunsaturated fatty acids has been suggested as having a positive impact on muscle diseases. We recently demonstrated that a diet enriched with plant derived n3-fatty , α- (ALA), exerts potent beneficial effects in preserving skeletal muscle regeneration in models of muscle dystrophy. To better elucidate the underlying mechanism we here investigate on the expression level of the anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins, as well as caspase-3 activity, in C2C12 myoblasts challenged with pathological levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF). The results demonstrated that ALA protective effect on C2C12 myoblasts was associated with a decrease in caspase-3 activity and an increase of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Indeed, the effect of ALA was directed to rescuing Bcl-2 expression and to revert Bax translocation to  both affected in an opposite way by TNF, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine expressed in damaged skeletal muscle.

The present study was conducted to analyze the profiles of fatty acids extracted from  tissues and their anti-inflammatory effects on RAW264.7 macrophage cells. In different tissues, the component ratios of saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids differed; particularly, polyunsaturated fatty acids such as dihomo-gamma- (20:3n-6) and eicosapentaenoic  (20:5n-3) were considerably different. In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, fatty acids from  skin, gonads, and digestive glands exhibited anti-inflammatory activities by reducing nitric oxide production and inducing nitric oxide synthase gene expression.  fatty acids effectively suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells. Cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E, which are critical  biomarkers, were also significantly suppressed. Furthermore,  fatty acids reduced the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB p-65, p38, extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, indicating that these fatty acids ameliorated  through the nuclear factor-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.

Despite these recommendations, the intake of omega-3s in women of child-bearing age in the US remains very low. The low maternal status of DHA prior to pregnancy could impair fetal neurodevelopment.

Both GDM and preeclampsia are associated with altered maternal omega-3 status, altered placental omega-3 metabolism, reduced cord blood omega-3 levels and have an impact on neurodevelopment in the infant and on brain health later in life. These findings indicate lower DHA exposure of the developing baby may be driven by lower placental transfer in both conditions.

Few satisfactory advances have been made in management of ALD. Thus, novel and more practical treatment options are urgently needed. Flaxseed oil (FO) is rich in α- (ALA), a plant-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). However, the impact of dietary FO on chronic alcohol consumption remains unknown.In this study, we assessed possible effects of dietary FO on attenuation of ALD and associated mechanisms in mice. Firstly, mice were randomly allocated into four groups: pair-fed (PF) with corn oil (CO) group (PF/CO); alcohol-fed (AF) with CO group (AF/CO); PF with FO group (PF/FO); AF with FO group (AF/FO). Each group was fed modified Lieber-DeCarli liquid diets containing isocaloric maltose dextrin a control or alcohol with corn oil and flaxseed oil, respectively. After 6 weeks feeding, mice were euthanized and associated indications were investigated.Body weight (BW) was significantly elevated in AF/FO group compared with AF/CO group. Dietary FO reduced the abnormal elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in chronic ethanol consumption. Amelioration of these parameters as well as liver injury via HE staining in dietary FO supplementation in ALD demonstrated that dietary FO can effectively benefit for the protection against ALD. To further understand the underlying mechanisms, we investigated the inflammatory cytokine levels and gut microbiota. A series of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10, were determined. As a result, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were decreased in AF/FO group compared with control group; IL-10 showed no significant alteration between AF/CO and AF/FO groups (p > 0.05).

Subjects were randomized to receive either 21 or 42 g raw walnuts/d during each 6 wk intervention phase with a 6 wk washout between phases. Subjects were instructed to consume their usual diet, but refrain from eating any other tree nuts, seeds, peanuts, or ellagitannin-rich foods during the entire study, and other polyphenol-rich foods for 2 d prior to each study visit.Compared to baseline levels, red blood cell (RBC) linoleic  and plasma pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) were significantly higher after 6 wk with 42 g/d walnuts (P < 0.05 for both).

Intracellular reactive  species and malondialdehyde production were also assessed in cells supplemented with FA. Reactive  species production after 3 h of HO exposure was assessed to evaluate and to compare the potential protection of different FA against HO-induced oxidative stress. All FA treatments induced an intracellular GSH increase, matched by high concentrations of NADPH and an increase of γ-glutamyl-cysteine ligase activity.

To test this hypothesis, an isotopic tracer approach was used in batch cultures of rumen microorganisms with inoculum collected from cannulated ewes fed either a total mixed ration without  supplementation (control inoculum) or the same diet supplemented with 2% of fish oil, which is known to cause MFD in lactating sheep (FO-MFD inoculum). The [1-C]ALA was added at a dose of 1% of incubated dry matter and the proportions of C-labeled fatty acids (FA) were examined after 24 h of incubation, using complementary gas chromatography and gas chromatography-combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) analyses. Expected differences in FA profiles were confirmed between control and FO-MFD inocula (e.g., large decreases in 18:0 and increases in most 18:1 and 18:2 intermediates, particularly trans isomers, to fish oil supply). The biohydrogenation of ALA was extensive and yielded multiple metabolites, with a total of 48 chromatographic peaks showing C enrichment, regardless of the inoculum type. However, although ALA was biohydrogenated through common pathways under standard or MFD conditions, large changes in the accumulation of C-labeled FA suggest important differences in the relative contribution of each specific route. First, increased accumulation of trans-11-containing FA in FO-MFD incubations was accompanied by a general repression of the trans-13/14 pathway (supported by lower trans-13+14 18:1 or trans-11,trans-13 18:2 proportions), together with a lower production of cis FA (e.g., cis-9, -12, and -15 18:1 and some cis,cis 18:2). Results also downplayed the relevance of the trans-11 to trans-10 shift as an effective marker of diet-induced MFD in sheep, and challenged the involvement of some trans-10 intermediates (e.g., trans-10 18:1 and trans-10,cis-15 18:2) in the low- milk syndrome in this species. Conversely, increased abundance of most 18:3 intermediates (including some unidentified isomers) might be representative of ruminal alterations related to fish oil supplementation in ewes.

LS-28 exhibited faster and greater colonization of wounds than LS-11. In contrast to LS-28, the number of LS-11 cells dropped 1 and 2 h after application, and then increased only later. In vitro, LS-28 was more resistant to ROS-generated oxidative stress. The combined application of biocontrol yeasts and ROS-deactivating enzymes in apple wounds prevented the decrease in number of LS-11 cells mentioned above, and enhanced colonization and antagonistic activity of both biocontrol yeasts against B. cinerea and P. expansum. Polar lipids of LS-11 contained the more unsaturated and oxidizable , which was absent in LS-28. Resistance to oxidative stress could be a key mechanism of biocontrol yeasts antagonism against postharvest wound pathogens.</p><p>Keyword:['colonization', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16294926>4-oxo-2-hexenal, a mutagen formed by omega-3  peroxidation, causes DNA adduct formation in mouse organs.</a></h2><p>To identify mutagens formed in a model reaction of  peroxidation,  and hemin were reacted with dG. As a result, a 4-oxo-2-hexenal-dG adduct (dG*) was identified in the model reaction mixture. The 4-oxo-2-hexenal (4-OHE) showed mutagenic activity in the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA104. After 4-OHE was orally administered to mice, dG, 4-OHE-dC- and 4-OHE-5-methyl-dC adducts were detected in esophageal, stomach and intestinal DNA. In the vapor phase released from the -hemin model system, and in the smoke released during the broiling of fish, 4-OHE was detected by GCMS. The 4-OHE seems to be produced by the auto-oxidation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. These results provide a warning to workers dealing with omega-3 fats, who may be exposed to this volatile mutagen.</p><p>Keyword:[' methyl esterfat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30690246>The effect of fatty acids in red blood cell membranes on the dynamics of inflammatory markers following the coronary stent implantation.</a></h2><p>The effect of 20 fatty acids in erythrocyte cell membranes on the extent of inflammatory response and cell oxidative stress was evaluated using multidimensional statistical data analysis in 54 patients suffering from ischemic heart disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with coronary stent implantation using multidimensional statistical data analysis. A systemic inflammatory response was indicated by an increase of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and ceruloplasmin 48 h after stent implantation and by an increase of interleukin-6 (IL-6) 24 h after intervention. The increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) after 48 h was used as a marker of cell damage by oxidative stress. Multiple linear regression revealed statistically significant relationships between concentration of some fatty acids and the magnitude of inflammatory response, or oxidative stress, after stent implantation. The most significant relationship with an increase of plasma CRP was found for myristic  and, to a lesser extent, for oleic . Trans octadecenoic , and to a lesser extent palmitooleic and nervonic fatty acids were found in inverse correlation with the CRP increase. The increase of IL-6 showed a statistically significant correlation with myristic , to a lesser extent with cis-9-eicosenoic  and to the least extent with docosahexaenoic , inversely with pentadecanoic, γ- and stearic acids. An increase of oxidative stress (MDA) significantly correlated only with γ-. Other studied markers of inflammatory response to coronary stenting were SAA and ceruloplasmin (Cp).

To compare the separate effects of individual dietary n-3 PUFA on oxylipins in different adipose depots (gonadal, mesenteric, perirenal, subcutaneous) in males and females, rats were provided diets containing higher levels of α- (ALA), EPA or DHA. Each n-3 PUFA enhanced its respective oxylipins the most, while effects on other n-3 oxylipins varied. For example: in perirenal and subcutaneous depots, more DHA oxylipins were higher with dietary ALA than with EPA; dietary EPA uniquely decreased 14-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic , in contrast to increasing many other DHA oxylipins. The n-3 PUFAs also reduced oxylipins from n-6 PUFAs in order of effectiveness: DHA > EPA > ALA. Diet by sex interactions in all depots except the perirenal depot resulted in higher oxylipins in males given DHA, and higher oxylipins in females given the other diets. Diet and sex effects on oxylipins did not necessarily reflect effects on either their tissue phospholipid or neutral  PUFA precursors. These varying diet and sex effects on oxylipins in the different adipose sites indicate that they may have distinct effects on adipose function.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

On the other hand, a working group of IARC recently classified processed meat as 'carcinogenic to humans' and red meat as 'probably carcinogenic to humans' for colorectal cancer, appealing to critically consider the future role of meat in a healthy diet. This manuscript first evaluates the contribution of meat consumption to the supply of important micronutrients in the human food chain, and the extent to which this can be improved by primary production strategies, and impacts on human health. Secondly, the IARC hazard analysis of the carcinogenicity of red and processed meat consumption is discussed, arguing that having more insight in the mechanisms of the association offers opportunities for mitigation. It is advocated that the benefits and risks associated with red and processed meat consumption should not necessarily cause dilemmas, if these meats are consumed in moderate amounts as part of balanced diets.Copyright © 2016.

The plasma fibrinolytic system was evaluated by determining activities and total plasma concentrations of both tissue-type plasminogen activator before and after venous occlusion, and its inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1).PAI-1 activity was significantly higher in the hypertensives than in the normotensives. PAI-1 antigen tended to parallel PAI-1 activity, and levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen and activity tended to be lower in the hypertensives at baseline and after venous occlusion, but not significantly different from those in the normotensives. The hypertensives also had significantly higher body mass index and body fat content (measured by bio-impedance), increased plasma triglycerides, uric , fasting and 2-h glucose, C-peptide and insulin concentrations. In univariate linear regression analysis both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were found to be positively correlated with PAI-1 levels (r = 0.27, P < 0.01, for both). This correlation was maintained after adjustment for total body fat, fasting glucose, fasting insulin concentration or adipose tissue ; however, it was no longer significant after adjustment for plasma 2-h insulin, 2-h C-peptide, 2-h glucose or triglyceride levels. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that only 2-h insulin and triglyceride concentration showed an independent association with PAI-1 levels.This study confirms that, in 38-year-old males, hypertension is associated with increased PAI-1 activity. It supports the possibility that the relationship between blood pressure and PAI-1 may reflect the overall effect of the insulin resistance  (in particular hyperinsulinaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia) rather than a direct effect of blood pressure on the fibrinolytic system.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27009754>Serum n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, Δ5- and Δ6-desaturase activities, and risk of incident type 2  in men: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study.</a></h2><p>The role of n-6 (ω-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in type 2  (T2D) is inconclusive.

We studied primary human trophoblast (PHT) cells cultured for 90h to determine the fatty  and lipid composition of cytotrophoblast (18h culture) and syncytiotrophoblast (90h culture) cells. In cultured PHT total lipid fatty acids were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced at 90h compared to 18h in culture including lower levels of palmitic  (PA, 16:0, -37%), palmitoleic  (POA, 16:1n-7, -30%), oleic  (OA, 18:1n-9, -31%), LCPUFA arachidonic  (AA, 20:4n-6, -28%) and α- (ALA, 18:3n-3, -55%). In major lipid classes, OA and most of the n-3 and n-6 LCPUFA were markedly lower at 90h in TG (-57 to -76%; p < 0.05). In the cellular NEFA, n-6 LCPUFA, dihomo-γ- (DGLA, 20:3n-6) and AA were both reduced by -51% and DHA was -55% lower (p < 0.05) at 90h. In contrast, phospholipid FA content did not change between cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblast except for OA, which decreased by -62% (p < 0.05). Decreasing PHT TG and NEFA lipid content at 90h in culture is likely due to processes related to differentiation such as alterations in lipase activity that occur as cytotrophoblast cells differentiate.

With the use of the whole-embryo culture system, it has been demonstrated that high glucose causes embryo dysmorphogenesis, and that oxidative stress appears to be the main mechanism. In recent years, beneficial effect of omega-3 fatty acids has been demonstrated in various diabetic models, and in diabetic complications. Since diabetic embryopathy is mediated probably through membrane lipoperoxidation, This study was designed to find if omega-3 fatty acids could ameliorate the effect of high glucose over the dysmorphogenesis of whole rat embryo in culture. Postimplantational rat embryos were cultured in hyperglycemic media, with addition of , and morphologic and morphometric parameters were registered. Also, lipoperoxidation and fatty acids composition were measured in cultured embryos. Growth of embryos cultured in presence of glucose was very affected, whereas lipoperoxidation was increased, and it was found that Triton X-100 causes similar results than glucose. Addition of low micromolar doses of  overcome the effect of high glucose or Triton X-100, but higher doses does not ameliorates the effects of the carbohydrate or the detergent. Paradoxically, there are not significant changes in fatty acids composition, although the U/S fatty acids ratio shows an increasing tendency by high glucose and a normalizing tendency by omega-3 fatty acids. In conclusion, glucose and Triton X-100 induces in vitro dysmorphogenesis in post-implantational rat embryos associated with increased lipoperoxidation; and this nocive effect could be ameliorated by low micromolar doses of ALA.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Importantly, data among pregnant women are scarce. We investigated individual plasma phospholipid n-3 and n-6 PUFAs in early to midpregnancy in relation to subsequent risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Within the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort (n = 2,802), individual plasma phospholipid n-3 and n-6 PUFAs levels were measured at gestational weeks (GWs) 10-14, 15-26, 23-31, and 33-39 among 107 GDM cases (ascertained on average at GW 27) and 214 non-GDM controls. Conditional logistic regression was used, adjusting for major risk factors for GDM. After adjusting for covariates, individual n-3 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were inversely correlated with  markers, whereas individual n-6 dihomo-gamma- (DGLA) was positively correlated with  markers. At GW 15-26, a standard deviation (SD) increase in total n-3 PUFAs and individual n-3 DPA was associated with a 36% (adjusted odds ratio 0.64; 95% CI 0.42-0.96; P = 0.042) and 33% (0.67; 95% CI 0.45-0.99; P = 0.047) lower risk of GDM, respectively; however, the significance did not persist after post hoc false-discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR-corrected P values > 0.05). Associations between total n-6 PUFAs and GDM were null, whereas associations with individual n-6 PUFAs were differential. Per SD increase, gamma- (GLA) at GWs 10-14 and DGLA at GWs 10-14 and 15-26 were significantly associated with a 1.40- to 1.95-fold higher risk of GDM, whereas docosatetraenoic  (DTA) at GW 15-26 was associated with a 45% (0.55; 95% CI 0.37-0.83) lower risk of GDM (all FDR-corrected P values < 0.05). Null associations were observed for linoleic  (LA) in either gestational window in relation to risk of GDM. Women with high (≥median) n-3 PUFAs and low (<median) n-6 PUFAs levels had a 64% (95% CI 0.14-0.95; P value = 0.039) lower risk of GDM versus women with low n-3 and high n-6 PUFAs. Limitations include the inability to distinguish between exogenous and endogenous influences on circulating PUFA levels and the lack of causality inherent in observational studies.Our findings may suggest a potential role of primarily endogenously metabolized plasma phospholipid n-6 PUFAs including GLA, DGLA, and DTA in early to midpregnancy in the development of GDM. Null findings on primarily diet-derived n-3 EPA and DHA and n-6 LA do not provide strong evidence to suggest a beneficial role in prevention of GDM, although not excluding the potential benefit of EPA and DHA on glucose- homeostasis given the inverse associations with  markers.

Since the majority of published data has proven that their intake does not induce toxic or carcinogenic effects in humans, their possible preventive use against cancer has been suggested. On the other hand, it is unlikely that they could be effective in cancer patients as a single therapy. Nevertheless, a considerable effort has been put forth in recent years to evaluate the hypothesis that n-3 PUFA might improve the antineoplastic efficiency of currently used anticancer agents. The rationale for this therapeutic combinatory strategy is trying to increase cancer sensitivity to conventional therapies. This could allow the use of lower drug/radiation doses and, thereby, a reduction in the detrimental health effects associated with these treatments.

To avoid reporting bias, different dietary biomarkers (DBs) could be used instead of self-reported data. However, few studies investigated a combination of DBs to assess compliance and its influence on cardiometabolic risk factors. The objectives of this study were to use a combination of DBs to assess compliance and to investigate how a healthy Nordic diet (ND) influences cardiometabolic risk factors in participants with high apparent compliance compared with the whole study population. From a recently conducted isocaloric randomized trial, SYSDIET (Systems Biology in Controlled Dietary Interventions and Cohort Studies), in 166 individuals with , several DBs were assessed to reflect different key components of the ND: canola oil (serum phospholipid α-), fatty fish [eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)], vegetables (plasma β-carotene), and whole grains (plasma alkylresorcinols). High-fat dairy intake (expectedly low in the ND) was reflected by serum pentadecanoic . All participants with biomarker data (n = 154) were included in the analyses. Biomarkers were combined by using a biomarker rank score (DB score) and principal component analysis (PCA). The DB score was then used to assess compliance. During the intervention, median concentrations of alkylresorcinols, α-, EPA, and DHA were >25% higher in the ND individuals than in the controls (P < 0.05), whereas median concentrations of pentadecanoic  were 14% higher in controls (P < 0.05). Median DB score was 57% higher in the ND than in controls (P < 0.001) during the intervention, and participants were ranked similarly by DB score and PCA score. Overall, estimates of group difference in cardiometabolic effects generally appeared to be greater among compliant participants than in the whole study population (e.g., estimates of treatment effects on blood pressure and lipoproteins were ∼1.5- to 2-fold greater in the most compliant participants), suggesting that poor compliance attenuated the dietary effects. With adequate consideration of their limitations, DB combinations (e.g., DB score) could be useful for assessing compliance in intervention studies investigating cardiometabolic effects of healthy dietary patterns.

All sera (100%) at diagnosis and 70% of those obtained during the induction of remission demonstrated inhibition of mitogen-induced lymphocyte transformation as evidenced by decreased uptake of [3H]thymidine. The inhibition could not be overcome by an increase in the mitogen concentration. Eighteen sera demonstrating a mean inhibition of 44.2% had elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFA) compared with five sera showing no inhibition (p value = 0.001). Inhibition, within the range produced by leukemic sera, could be achieved by the purified methyl esters of linoleic and  in this system. Flow cytometric analysis of mitogen-induced cycling of normal human lymphocytes suggested that deoxyribonucleic  (DNA) replication was inhibited by leukemic sera containing elevated levels of FFA after the G1 phase of cell cycling. Similar inhibition could be achieved by the methyl ester of  in this system. Gas chromatographic analysis revealed that sera demonstrating inhibition contained  (C18:3)  (p value = 0.015), and the majority showed one or more of the following: 1) a concentration of oleic (C18:1)  greater than 2 standard deviations (SD) above the mean of the control leukemic sera (i.e., those not demonstrating inhibition); 2) an arachidonic (C20:4) to C18:1 ratio that is reduced to greater than 2 SD below the mean of the control group; or 3) the presence of an unexpected fatty  fraction.

Clinically, the blocking stimulation of the endocannabinoid pathway has been one of the first approaches proposed to counteract the  and -associated diseases (such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cancer). In this connection, here we studied in cultured 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes the effects of n-3-PUFA, α- (OM-3), n-6-PUFA, Linoleic  (OM-6), and hydroxytyrosol (HT) on the expression of CB1 receptor gene and the adipogenesis-related genes PPAR-γ, Fatty  Synthase (FAS) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL). HT was able to inhibit 3T3-L1 cell differentiation by down-regulating cell proliferation and CB1 receptor gene expression. HT exhibited anti-adipogenic effects, whereas OM-3 and OM-6 exerted an inhibitory action on cell proliferation associated with an induction of the preadipocytes differentiation and CB1 receptor gene expression. Moreover, the expression of FAS and LPL genes resulted increased after treatment with both HT and OM-3 and OM-6. The present study points out that the intake of molecules such as HT, contained in extra virgin olive oil, may be considered also in view of antiobesity and antineoplastic properties by acting directly on the adipose tissue and modulating CB1 receptor gene transcription.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'lipogenesis', 'metabolic syndrome', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2848532>Suppression of monosodium urate crystal-induced acute inflammation by diets enriched with gamma- and eicosapentaenoic .</a></h2><p>A subcutaneous air pouch formed in Sprague-Dawley rats was used to study the effect of diets enriched in gamma- (GLA) (in plant seed oil) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) (in fish oil) on acute inflammation induced by monosodium urate crystals. The GLA-enriched diet suppressed significantly the cellular phase of inflammation (polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation, crystal phagocytosis, and lysosomal enzyme activity), but it had little effect on the fluid phase (exudate volume and protein concentration). In contrast, the EPA-enriched diet suppressed the fluid phase but not the cellular phase of inflammation. The findings indicate that the fluid and cellular phases of acute inflammation can be controlled independently.

Furthermore, no enhanced fungitoxicity was detected in methanolic leaf extracts, suggesting that accumulation of bean phytoalexins was not part of the stimulated defense mechanisms. However, BTP1-inoculated plants showed increased levels of both linoleic and  acids. On this basis, we further investigated whether the lipoxygenase pathway, leading to antifungal phytooxylipins, could have been stimulated. Two key enzymatic activities of this metabolic route, namely lipoxygenase and hydroperoxide lyase, were significantly stimulated during the first four days after challenging BTP1-treated plants with the pathogen. This was observed in parallel with a more rapid consumption of the respective substrates of these enzymes, as revealed by measurements of endogenous concentrations of  and their hydroperoxide derivatives. Moreover, headspace-gas chromatography analyses showed significantly higher concentrations of the fungitoxic final product Z-3-hexenal in leaves from BTP1-inoculated beans as compared with control plants.

A transcription assay using LβT2 cells demonstrated that LCFAs, oleic , α-, docosahexaenoic  and palmitate, repressed the expression of Cga, Lhb, and Fshb at concentrations between 50 and 100 µM. On the other hand, treatment with 10 µM unsaturated LCFAs, oleic , α- and docosahexaenoic , repressed only Fshb expression, while the same dose of a saturated LCFA, palmitate, had no effect on the expression of gonadotropin subunit genes. Furthermore, GW9508 did not affect promoter activity. Next, we examined deletion mutants of the upstream region of Fshb and found that the upstream regulatory region (-2824 to -2343 bp) of Fshb was responsible for the notable repression by 10 µM unsaturated LCFAs. Our results suggest that the upstream region of Fshb is susceptible to unsaturated LCFAs.

Both are considered precursors of a cascade of molecules (eicosanoids), which take part in many biological processes (, vasoconstriction/vasodilation, thromboregulation, etc.). However, their biological functions are opposite and are mainly related to the form (precursor or long-chain products) in which they were administered and to the enzyme-substrate preference. ALA is widely present in common vegetable oils and foods, marine algae, and natural herbs, whereas its long-chain PUFA derivatives are available mainly in fish and animal product origins.

In addition, the administration of fenugreek TG reverted back the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme respectively in kidney and plasma by 33 and 29%. Interestingly, the fenugreek TG inhibited lipase activity in small intestine by 33% which leads to the regulation of lipid profile.

Four groups of BALB/c mice received ALA enriched diet (3% (w/w)) either alone or in combination with B. breve NCIMB 702258 or B. breve DPC 6330 (10 CFU/day) or unsupplemented control diet for six weeks. The overall n-3 PUFA score was increased in all groups receiving the ALA enriched diet. Hepatic peroxisomal beta oxidation increased following supplementation of the ALA enriched diet with B. breve (P < 0.05) and so the ability of the strains to produce c9t11 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) was identified in adipose tissue. Furthermore, a strain specific effect of B. breve NCIMB 702258 was found on the endocannabinoid system (ECS).

Dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFAs has recently become popular and their adequate intake during pregnancy and early childhood is of clinical importance. The results of experimental and epidemiological investigations reveal that n-3 PUFAs, especially α-  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), may decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases. It is believed that n-3 PUFAs affect a multitude of molecular pathways, involving regulation of gene expression, alteration of physical and chemical properties of cellular membranes and modulation of membrane channels and proteins. A large body of evidence focuses on anti-inflammatory properties of PUFAs which seem to be fundamental in prevention and reversing of insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, thromboembolism and in improving vascular function. Despite the potential PUFAs benefits of decreasing insulin resistance, their application in order to prevent preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant women with MS has not yet been established. Numerous reports have revealed that appropriate fetal development, including neuronal, retinal and immune function depends on EPA and DHA which are crucial also for prevention of preterm birth. Thus the supplementation with EPA and DHA is highly recommended during pregnancy although the optimal dosing and treatment strategies still need to be determined.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance', 'metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485451>Effect of Early and Late Interventions with Dietary Oils on Vascular and Neural Complications in a Type 2 Diabetic Rat Model.</a></h2><p>Determine the effect of dietary oils enriched in different mono- or polyunsaturated fatty acids, i.e., olive oil (18 : 1, oleic ), safflower oil (18 : 2 n-6, linoleic ), flaxseed oil (18 : 3 n-3, ), evening primrose oil (18 : 3 n-6, gamma ), or menhaden oil (20:5/22 : 6 n-3 eicosapentaenoic/docosahexaenoic acids), on vascular and neural complications in high-fat-fed low-dose streptozotocin-treated Sprague-Dawley rats, an animal model for late-stage type 2 .Rats were fed a high-fat diet (45% kcal as fat primarily derived from lard) for 8 weeks and then treated with a low dose of streptozotocin (30 mg/kg) in order to induce hyperglycemia.

In this study, the efficacy of a yeast mating approach with Yarrowia lipolytica that can combine a previously engineering and evolved xylose phenotype with a metabolite overproduction phenotype is demonstrated. Specifically, several engineered Y. lipolytica strains that produce α- (ALA), riboflavin, and triacetic  lactone (TAL) with an engineered and adapted xylose-utilizing strain to obtain three diploid strains that rapidly produce these molecules directly from xylose are mated. Titers of 0.52 g L ALA, 96.6 mg L riboflavin, and 2.9 g L TAL, are obtained from xylose in flask cultures and 1.42 g L production of ALA is obtained using bioreactor condition. This total production level is generally on par or higher than the parental strain cultivated on glucose, although specific productivities decreased as a result of improved overall cell growth by the diploid strains. In the case of ALA, this lipid content reached similar levels to that of flaxseed oil.

Blood, milk, liver and ovaries were collected from the does to assess the  composition; furthermore, FADS2 gene expression was assessed in liver and ovary tissues. Reproductive performance of does was also recorded. The fertility rate and number of weaned rabbits improved with n-3 dietary supplementation: does at first parity showed the lowest reproductive results, but the administration of n-3 reduced the gap between primiparous and multiparous does. Feed consumption and milk production were not affected by the feeding regime. The fatty  composition of milk, plasma, liver and ovaries were widely influenced by diet, showing higher concentrations of n-3 long-chain PUFA (LCP) in does fed with n-3 enriched diets. FISH diet resulted in the highest n-3 LCP enrichment, whereas in the FLAX group, this increase was lower. Blood and milk showed low levels of LCP, whereas liver and ovaries were the main sites of n-3 LCP synthesis and accumulation. Accordingly, although the liver is the main metabolic centre for LCP synthesis, ovaries also have a prominent role in LCP generation. FADS2 expression in liver and ovary tissue was downregulated by FISH administration.

Total cholesterol, hepatosomatic index, Nrf2, antioxidant, and  markers were determined. CHIA reduced the hypercholesterolemic effect by lowering levels similar to C; also, ameliorated redox index. CHIA, despite high polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content, reduced thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) and induced the lowest SOD protein synthesis but not a reduction on its activity. Chia oil activated the Nrf2 to arrest the pro-oxidative response to cholesterol and aging. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) system was lower in HxT than in CHIA, suggesting its antiatherogenic activity and related protective effect against high PUFA.

Incorporation of PNA and Δ7-ETrA into murine macrophages inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. Due to the lack of availability of the naturally-occurring fatty acid, we synthesized Δ7-ETrA and demonstrated it was capable of suppressing PGE2 production. Using laboratory synthetic techniques involving 2-carbon elongation and argentated column chromatography, Δ7-ETrA was synthesized and isolated. Its identity and purity (>98%) were confirmed by gas chromatography (GC)/GC-mass spectroscopy. Incubation of murine RAW264.7 cells or rat primary peritoneal macrophages with Δ7-ETrA reduced PGE2 production by up to 84%, but slightly down-regulated type-2 cyclooxygenase (COX-2) expression. Δ7-ETrA blocked nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) translocation into nucleus and inactivated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), however, these results might not directly account for its inhibitory effect. Furthermore, PGE2 production reduced by Δ7-ETrA was highly correlated with the extent of Δ7-ETrA incorporation into cellular phospholipids and appeared to be the result of competition between this unusual fatty acid and arachidonic acid (AA) for COX-2.

The present study investigated the effects of a low-calorie diet (800 kcal/day deficit for 8 weeks) on erythrocyte membrane properties in 70 overweight and moderately obese (body mass index, 25-33 kg/m(2)) normotensive, nondiabetic women. At the end of dietary intervention, 24.3% of women dropped out, 45.7% lost less than 5% of their initial weight (Group I) and only 30% of patients lost at least 5% of their initial body weight (Group II). Group I showed no significant changes in erythrocyte membrane composition and function. The erythrocyte membranes of Group II showed significant reductions in malondialdehyde, lipofuscin, cholesterol, sphingomyelin, palmitic  and nervonic  and an increase in di-homo-γ-, arachidonic  and membrane fluidity. Moreover, Group II showed an improvement in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycemia and . These changes in erythrocyte membrane composition could reflect a virtuous cycle resulting from the reduction in  associated with increased membrane fluidity that, in turn, results in a sequence of metabolic events that concur to further improve membrane fluidity.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, FA  differs between different organs, suggesting a distinct partitioning of highly relevant FA. For the present study in cattle, a novel technology was applied to overcome rumen biohydrogenation of dietary unsaturated FA. Angus heifers were fed a straw-based diet supplemented for 8 weeks with 450 g/day of rumen-protected oil, either from fish (FO) or sunflower (SO). The FA composition in blood and five important organs, namely heart, kidney, liver, lung, and spleen, was examined. In blood, proportions of polyunsaturated FA were increased by supplementing FO compared to SO. The largest increase of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) proportion was found with FO instead of SO in the kidney, the lowest in the lung. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA) was increased more in the liver than in kidney, lung, and spleen. The heart incorporated seven times more EPA than DHA, which is more than all other organs and described here for the first time in ruminants. In addition, the heart had the highest proportions of α- (18:3n-3) and linoleic  (18:2n-6) of all organs. The proportions of polyunsaturated FA in the lung and spleen were exceptionally low compared to heart, liver, and kidney. In conclusion, it was shown that the response to FO in the distribution of dietary n-3 FA was organ-specific while proportions of n-6 FA were quite inert with respect to the type of oil supplemented.© 2019 AOCS.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27043529>Two ω-3 FADs Are Associated with Peach Fruit  Formation.</a></h2><p>Aroma-related volatiles, together with sugars and , play an important role in determining fruit flavor quality. Characteristic volatiles of peach fruit are mainly derived from   such as linoleic  (18:2) and  (18:3). In the present study, six genes encoding   desaturases (FAD) were cloned, including two ω-6 FAD genes (PpFAD2, PpFAD6) and four ω-3 FAD genes (PpFAD3-1, PpFAD3-2, PpFAD7 and PpFAD8). Heterologous expression of peach FADs in tobacco plants showed that PpFAD3-1, and PpFAD3-2 significantly reduced contents of 18:2, and accumulated significant higher levels of 18:3. In the case of volatiles, transgenic plants produced lower concentrations of hexanal and higher levels of (E)-2-hexenal. Consequently, the ratio of the (E)-2-hexenal and hexanal was about 5- and 3-fold higher than that of wild type (WT) in PpFAD3-1 and PpFAD3-2 transformants, respectively. No significant changes in  profiles were observed in transgenic plants overexpressing the four other peach FAD genes. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed that ripe fruit had high PpFAD3-1 and low PpFAD3-2 transcript levels. In contrast, high PpFAD3-2 and low PpFAD3-1 transcript levels were observed in young fruit. These results indicate a temporal regulation of these two ω-3 FADs during development and ripening, influencing peach fruit  formation.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26571451>Omega 6 fatty acids for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Omega 6 plays a vital role in many physiological functions but there is controversy concerning its effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. There is conflicting evidence whether increasing or decreasing omega 6 intake results in beneficial effects.The two primary objectives of this Cochrane review were to determine the effectiveness of:1. Increasing omega 6 (Linoleic  (LA), Gamma- (GLA), Dihomo-gamma- (DGLA), Arachidonic  (AA), or any combination) intake in place of saturated or monounsaturated fats or carbohydrates for the primary prevention of CVD.2. Decreasing omega 6 (LA, GLA, DGLA, AA, or any combination) intake in place of carbohydrates or protein (or both) for the primary prevention of CVD.We searched the following electronic databases up to 23 September 2014: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on the Cochrane Library (Issue 8 of 12, 2014); MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to September week 2, 2014); EMBASE Classic and EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to September 2014); Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters) (1990 to September 2014); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and Health Technology Assessment Database, and Health Economics Evaluations Database on the Cochrane Library (Issue 3 of 4, 2014). We searched trial registers and reference lists of reviews for further studies. We applied no language restrictions.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions stating an intention to increase or decrease omega 6 fatty acids, lasting at least six months, and including healthy adults or adults at high risk of CVD. The comparison group was given no advice, no supplementation, a placebo, a control diet, or continued with their usual diet. The outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal end points) and CVD risk factors (changes in blood pressure, changes in blood lipids, occurrence of type 2 ). We excluded trials involving exercise or multifactorial interventions to avoid confounding.Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included trials.We included four RCTs (five papers) that randomised 660 participants. No ongoing trials were identified. All included trials had at least one domain with an unclear risk of bias. There were no RCTs of omega 6 intake reporting CVD clinical events. Three trials investigated the effect of increased omega 6 intake on lipid levels (total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL-cholesterol), and high density lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol)), two trials reported triglycerides, and two trials reported blood pressure (diastolic and systolic blood pressure). Two trials, one with two relevant intervention arms, investigated the effect of decreased omega 6 intake on blood pressure parameters and lipid levels (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol) and one trial reported triglycerides. Our analyses found no statistically significant effects of either increased or decreased omega 6 intake on CVD risk factors.Two studies were supported by funding from the UK Food Standards Agency and Medical Research Council. One study was supported by Lipid Nutrition, a commercial company in the Netherlands and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. The final study was supported by grants from the Finnish Food Research Foundation, Finnish Heart Research Foundation, Aarne and Aili Turnen Foundation, and the Research Council for Health, Academy of Finland.We found no studies examining the effects of either increased or decreased omega 6 on our primary outcome CVD clinical endpoints and insufficient evidence to show an effect of increased or decreased omega 6 intake on CVD risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure.

For this reason, CLA has been marketed as a supplement to promote weight loss and general health. CLA has also been heavily marketed to resistance-trained athletes as a supplement that may help lessen catabolism, decrease body fat, and promote greater gains in strength and muscle mass during training. Although basic research is promising, few studies have examined whether CLA supplementation during training enhances training adaptations and/or affects markers of health. This study evaluated whether CLA supplementation during resistance training affects body composition, strength, and/or general markers of catabolism and . In a double-blind and randomized manner, 23 experienced, resistance-trained subjects were matched according to body mass and training volume and randomly assigned to supplement their diet with 9 g;pdd(-1) of an olive oil placebo or 6 g;pdd(-1) of CLA with 3 g;pdd(-1) of fatty acids for 28 days. Prior to and following supplementation, fasting blood samples, total body mass, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) determined body composition, and isotonic bench press and leg press 1 repetition maximums (1RMs) were determined. Results revealed that although some statistical trends were observed with moderate to large effect sizes, CLA supplementation did not significantly affect (p > 0.05) changes in total body mass, fat-free mass, fat mass, percent body fat, bone mass, strength, serum substrates, or general markers of catabolism and  during training.

Hypoalbuminemia is often observed in sepsis patients. An imbalance among these compounds formed from FAs caused by hypoalbuminemia may be related to increased mortality in sepsis patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlations between serum albumin and FAs in sepsis and the outcome. Methods This study was an observational investigation. The clinical and laboratory data of sepsis patients were recorded and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was calculated at admission. The serum arachidonic  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and dihomo-gamma- (DHLA) levels were also measured as FAs. The body mass index (BMI) was used to determine the general nutrition status. Results Two hundred sepsis patients were enrolled during the study period. No significant correlations were observed between the BMI and the SOFA score or the serum albumin level at admission. The FA levels of the non-survivors were significantly lower, but there were no significant differences in the EPA/AA levels of the survivors and non-survivors. A low serum albumin level was closely related to low AA (p<0.0001), EPA (p<0.0001), DHA (p=0.0003), and DHLA levels (p<0.0001). A multiple logistic-regression analysis revealed that a high SOFA score [adjusted odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.39, p=0.026] and low AA (adjusted odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.978-0.994, p=0.041) were associated with a poor outcome. Conclusion A lower AA level was an important determinant of the outcome of patients with sepsis. These findings are consistent with the findings of previous studies, which reported that hypoalbuminemia might alter the AA metabolism in sepsis patients.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27035483>Effect of low temperature on highly unsaturated fatty  biosynthesis in activated sludge.</a></h2><p>Low temperature is a limiting factor for the microbial activity of activated sludge for sewage treatment plant in winter.

The constituents isolated and characterized in ginseng stems include ginsenosides,  , amino ,  oils, and polysaccharides. In this study, the effects of fungicide azoxystrobin applied on antioxidant enzyme activity and ginsenosides content in ginseng stems was studied by using Panax ginseng C. A. Mey. cv. (the cultivar of Ermaya) under natural environmental conditions. The azoxystrobin formulation (25% SC) was sprayed three times on ginseng plants at different doses (150ga.i./ha and 225ga.i./ha), respectively. Two new   esters (ethyl linoleate and ) were firstly detected in ginseng stems by the application of azoxystrobin as foliar spray. The results indicated that activities of enzymatic antioxidants, the content of ginsenosides and two new   esters in ginseng stems in azoxystrobin-treated plants were increased. Azoxystrobin treatments to ginseng plants at all growth stages suggest that the azoxystrobin-induced delay of senescence is due to an enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity protecting the plants from harmful active oxygen species (AOS). The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in azoxystrobin-treated plants was about 1-3 times higher than that in untreated plants. And the effects was more significant (P=0.05) when azoxystrobin was applied at dose of 225ga.i./ha. This work suggests that azoxystrobin plays an important role in delaying of senescence by changing physiological and biochemical indicators and increasing ginsenosides content in ginseng stems.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Intakes of total fat, saturated fatty acids (SFA) and polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) were assessed by a validated food-frequency questionnaire, and correlated with birthweight and incidence of small for gestational age (SGA) infants.This is a population that traditionally consumes diets that are low in SFA and n-3 PUFA, but high in linoleic  (LA, 18:2 n-6). The data show that consumption of low SFA was associated with decreased birthweight and an increased risk of SGA [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 2.1). Similar results were seen with n-3 PUFA: low intakes of  (ALNA, 18:3 n-3) as well as low intakes of long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFA were associated with increased risk of SGA (AOR 1.70; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.6, and AOR 1.27; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.1, respectively). Increased intakes of SFA and ALNA were predominantly associated with lower intakes of cereals and higher intakes of milk and milk products.These findings show that higher intakes of SFA and n-3 PUFA in early stages of pregnancy are associated with increased birthweight and reduced incidence of SGA in a South Indian population.© The Author 2016; all rights reserved.

This oxidation influences cellular metabolism and can trigger cellular signaling cascades, since cellular membranes and the stratum corneum contain a substantial amount of fatty acids and lipids. Using highly sensitive IR-photomultiplier technology, we investigated the generation of singlet  by fatty acids and lipids. In combination with their oxidized products, the fatty acids or lipids produced singlet  under UVA radiation at 355 nm that is directly shown by luminescence detection.  or arachidonic  showed the strongest luminescence signals, followed by linoleic  and docohexaenoic . The amount of singlet  induced by lipids such as phosphatidylcholine was significantly higher compared to the corresponding fatty acids within phospholipids. This result indicates a synergistic process of  radicals and singlet  during irradiation. UVA radiation initiates singlet  generation, which subsequently oxidizes other fatty acids that in turn produce additional singlet . This leads to an enhancement of UVA-induced damage of fatty acids and lipids, which must enhance the oxidative damages in cells.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28802571>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids improve endothelial function in humans at risk for atherosclerosis: A review.</a></h2><p>Epidemiology studies and clinical trials show that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) can prevent atherosclerotic morbidity and evidence suggests this may be mediated by improving endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by reduced vasodilation and a pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic state, and is an early pathological event in the development of atherosclerosis. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a gold standard for assessing endothelial dysfunction, is a predictor of future cardiovascular events and coronary heart disease risk. Notably, risk factors for endothelial dysfunction include classic risk factors for atherosclerosis: Elevated lipids, diabetes, hypertension, elevated BMI, cigarette smoking, and . In this paper, we review the ability of n-3 PUFAs to improve endothelial dysfunction in individuals with classic risk factors for atherosclerosis, but lacking diagnosed atherosclerotic disease, with the goal of identifying those individuals that might gain the most vasoprotection from n-3 PUFA supplements. We include trials using eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), or  (ALA) alone, or EPA+DHA; and assessing endothelial function by FMD, forearm blood flow, or peripheral arterial tonometry. We found that n-3 PUFAs improved endothelial dysfunction in 16 of 17 studies in individuals with hyperlipidemia, elevated BMI, , or that smoked cigarettes, but only in 2 of 5 studies in diabetics. Further, these trials showed that use of EPA+DHA consistently improve endothelial dysfunction; ALA-enriched diets appear promising; but use of EPA or DHA alone requires further study. We conclude that individuals with hyperlipidemia, elevated BMI, , or that smoke could derive vaosprotective benefits from EPA+DHA supplementation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We had observed that pigs infected with Trichuris suis for 21 days showed significant changes in the proximal colon microbiota. In this study, interactions between worm burden and severity of disruptions to the microbial composition and metabolic potentials in the porcine proximal colon microbiota were investigated using metagenomic tools. Pigs were infected by a single dose of T. suis eggs for 53 days. Among infected pigs, two cohorts were differentiated that either had adult worms or were worm-free. Infection resulted in a significant change in the abundance of approximately 13% of genera detected in the proximal colon microbiota regardless of worm status, suggesting a relatively persistent change over time in the microbiota due to the initial infection. A significant reduction in the abundance of Fibrobacter and Ruminococcus indicated a change in the fibrolytic capacity of the colon microbiota in T. suis infected pigs. In addition, ∼10% of identified KEGG pathways were affected by infection, including ABC transporters, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis as well as α- metabolism. Trichuris suis infection modulated host  to Campylobacter because there was a 3-fold increase in the relative abundance in the colon microbiota of infected pigs with worms compared to naïve controls, but a 3-fold reduction in worm-free infected pigs compared to controls. The level of pathology observed in infected pigs with worms compared to worm-free infected pigs may relate to the local host response because expression of several Th2-related genes were enhanced in infected pigs with worms versus those worm-free. Our findings provided insight into the dynamics of the proximal colon microbiota in pigs in response to T. suis infection.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15357026>Selective increase in  (all-cis-5,9,12-18:3) in Korean pine nut oil by crystallization and its effect on LDL-receptor activity.</a></h2><p>The aims of this study were to obtain concentrated  (5,9,12-18:3) from dietary Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) nut oil by urea complexation and to investigate its cholesterol-lowering effect on the LDL-receptor activity of human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Pine nut oil was hydrolyzed to provide a low--containing FA extract (LPAFAE), followed by crystallization with different ratios of urea in ethanol (EtOH) or methanol (MeOH) as a solvent to produce a high--containing FA extract (HPAFAE).

Northern blot analysis showed that LeFAD3 was expressed in all organs tested and was markedly abundant in roots. Meanwhile, the expression of LeFAD3 was induced by chilling stress (4 degrees C), but inhibited by high temperature (40 degrees C). The transgenic plants were obtained under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (35S-CaMV). Northern and western blot analyses confirmed that sense LeFAD3 was transferred into tomato genome and overexpressed. Level of  acids (18:3) increased and correspondingly level of linoleic  (18:2) decreased in leaves and roots. After chilling stress, the fresh weight of the aerial parts of transgenic plants was higher than that of the wild type (WT) plants, and the membrane system ultrastructure of chloroplast in leaf cell and all the subcellular organelles in root tips of transgenic plants kept more intact than those of WT. Relative electric conductivity increased less in transgenic plants than that in WT, and the respiration rate of the transgenic plants was notably higher than that of WT. The maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (F(v)/F(m)) and the O(2) evolution rate in WT decreased more than those in transgenic plants under chilling stress.

This study explores the effect of dietary supplementation with  and P127 biomass on tissue fatty  composition, immune function, and disease resistance in zebrafish (). The broken microalgal biomass was added to commercial fish feed at 7.5 and 15% (w/w), providing 21.8 mg/g feed ARA for the WT-supplemented group and 13.6 mg/g feed DGLA for the MUT-supplemented group at the 15% inclusion levels.

The elevated expression of specific immune-related genes was evident in the kidneys in all treatment groups after 1 month of feeding, including genes related to eicosanoid synthesis, lysozyme, and NF-κB. In the liver, microalgal supplementation led to the upregulation of genes related to immune function and antioxidant defense while the expression of examined genes involved in ARA  was downregulated. Importantly, fish fed with 15% of both WT- and MUT-supplemented feed showed significantly ( < 0.05) higher survival percentages (78 and 68%, respectively, as compared to only 46% in the control group).

Pesticides may, however, negatively affect their behavior, physiology, and survival. To assess this, a 42-day-lasting bioassay was conducted, during which damselfly larvae (Ischnura graellsii; n = 20) were repeatedly exposed to lambda-cyhalothrin (3 days at; 0, 10, 50, 250, 1250, and 6250ng LCH L), followed by recovery phases (4 days) in pesticide-free medium for six weeks. This exposure design was used to simulate frequent runoff events in the field. Variables related to the behavior (strikes against prey and capture success), growth, physiology (lipid content and fatty  composition), as well as mortality were assessed throughout the experiment. The two highest LCH concentrations induced 100% mortality within the first 48h, whereas 85% of the test organisms survived 28 days under control conditions. The number of strikes against prey was not affected by LCH. In contrast, prey capture success decreased significantly (up to ~50% at 250ng LCH L, for instance, after the third pulse exposure) following LCH-exposures compared to the control. This difference was not observed after recovery phases, however, which did not counteract the enhanced  demand for detoxification and defense mechanisms indicated by a lower growth rate (up to ~20%) and lipid content (up to ~30%) of damselflies at 50 and 250ng LCH L. In addition, two essential fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic  and arachidonic ) and two precursors ( and α-) decreased in their concentrations upon exposure towards 250ng LCH L. Thus the results of this study indicate that long-term exposure towards LCH pulses can affect damselfly behavior, physiology and survival. Given the essential role of damselflies in food web dynamics, these effects may potentially translate into local population impairments with subsequent bottom-up directed effects within and across ecosystem boundaries.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The HB diet significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride concentrations and increased acyl-CoA oxidase activity in WD, but not in KO mice. However, regardless of genotype, body fat percentage was lowered along with upregulated protein levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and tyrosine hydroxylase, as well as signaling pathway of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and AMP-activated protein kinase in the white adipose tissue of HB-treated groups compared to HS cohorts. In WD-HB and KO-HB groups, white adipose tissue had autophagy, apoptosis, inflammation, and browning characteristics. Without PPARα, in vivo reduction of α-ESA into rumenic  was slightly but significantly lowered, along with remarkable reduction of hepatic retinol saturase () expression.

Interestingly, a surprisingly high degree of genetic diversification within L. aequinoctialis was observed. The four duckweed species revealed a uniform fatty  composition, with three fatty acids, palmitic , linoleic  and , accounting for more than 80% of the TFA. The TFA in biomass varied among species, ranging from 1.05% (of dry weight, DW) for L. punctata and S. polyrhiza to 1.62% for Wolffia globosa. The four duckweed species contained similar TAG contents, 0.02% mg · DW(-1). The fatty  profiles of TAG were different from those of TFA, and also varied among the four species. The survey investigated the genetic diversity of duckweeds from Lake Chao, and provides an initial insight into TFA and TAG of four duckweed species, indicating that intraspecific and interspecific variations exist in the content and composition of both TFA and TAG in comparison with other studies.© 2015 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27646568>Fish Consumption, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease.</a></h2><p>Data on omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in relation to cardiovascular disease are limited in women. The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal relations of tuna and dark fish, α-, and marine omega-3 fatty  intake with incident major cardiovascular disease in women.This was a prospective cohort study of U.S. women participating in the Women's Health Study from 1993 to 2014, during which the data were collected and analyzed. A total of 39,876 women who were aged ≥45 years and free of cardiovascular disease at baseline provided dietary data on food frequency questionnaires. Analyses used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between fish and -adjusted omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  intake and the risk of major cardiovascular disease, defined as a composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death, in 38,392 women in the final analytic sample (96%).During 713,559 person years of follow-up, 1,941 cases of incident major cardiovascular disease were confirmed. Tuna and dark fish intake was not associated with the risk of incident major cardiovascular disease (p-trend >0.05). Neither α- nor marine omega-3 fatty  intake was associated with major cardiovascular disease or with individual cardiovascular outcomes (all p-trend >0.05). There was no effect modification by age, BMI, or baseline history of hypertension.In this cohort of women without history of cardiovascular disease, intakes of tuna and dark fish, α-, and marine omega-3 fatty acids were not associated with risk of major cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

However, relationships between fatty acids and locomotor system dysfunctions in elderly population remain controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of fatty  quality on the age related evolution of the locomotor system and to understand which aging mechanisms are involved. In order to analyze age related complications, the SAMP8 mouse strain was chosen as a progeria model as compared to the SAMR1 control strain. Then, two months old mice were divided in different groups and subjected to the following diets : (1) standard "growth" diet - (2) "sunflower" diet (high ω6/ω3 ratio) - (3) "borage" diet (high γ-) - (4) "fish" diet (high in long chain ω3). Mice were fed ad libitum through the whole protocol. At 12 months old, the mice were sacrificed and tissues were harvested for bone studies, fat and muscle mass measures, inflammation parameters and bone cell marker expression. We demonstrated for the first time that borage and fish diets restored inflammation and bone parameters using an original model of senile osteoporosis that mimics clinical features of aging in humans. Therefore, our study strongly encourages nutritional approaches as relevant and promising strategies for preventing aged-related locomotor dysfunctions.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

It belongs to oxylipins group, which are important lipid mediators in biological processes, such as tissue repair, blood clotting, blood vessel permeability,  and immunity regulation. Recently, isoprostanoids from eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic, adrenic and α- namely F3-isoprostanes, F4-neuroprostanes, F2-dihomo-isoprostanes and F1-phytoprostanes, respectively have attracted attention because of their putative contribution to health. Since isoprostanoids are derived from different substrate of PUFAs and can have similar or opposing biological consequences, a total isoprostanoids profile is essential to understand the overall effect in the testing model. However, the concentration of most isoprostanoids range from picogram to nanogram, therefore a sensitive method to quantify 20 isoprostanoids simultaneously was formulated and measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The lipid portion from various biological samples was extracted prior to LC-MS/MS evaluation. For all the isoprostanoids LOD and LOQ, and the method was validated on plasma samples for matrix effect, yield of extraction and reproducibility were determined. The methodology was further tested for the isoprostanoids profiles in brain and liver of LDLR(-/-) mice with and without docosahexaenoic  (DHA) supplementation. Our analysis showed similar levels of total F2-isoprostanes and F4-neuroprostanes in the liver and brain of non-supplemented LDLR(-/-) mice. The distribution of different F2-isoprostane isomers varied between tissues but not for F4-neuroprostanes which were predominated by the 4(RS)-4-F4t-neuroprostane isomer. DHA supplementation to LDLR(-/-) mice concomitantly increased total F4-neuroprostanes levels compared to F2-isoprostanes but this effect was more pronounced in the liver than brain.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that BBPs have high dietary fiber (57.46%), carbohydrate (18.93%) and protein (13.81%) content versus low fat content (<1%) contributing to a low  value of 139.24 kcal per 100 g. Profiling of fatty acids showed an abundance of the essential polyunsaturated α- and linoleic acids, exhibiting an excellent nutritional quality as revealed by their low atherogenic and thrombogenic indices and their hypocholesterolemic properties. The methanol extract which exhibited the highest total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents was found to be the most active extract in terms of antimicrobial and anti-radical activities. In alloxan-induced diabetic mice, the oral administration of a methanol extract (500 mg per kg bw) attenuated the elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase activities, and urea, uric , and creatinine. It effectively normalized the status of lipid profiles, mitigated oxidative stress through the activation of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, GPx and SOD), and alleviated oxidative stress-mediated histopathological changes in the pancreas, liver, kidney and testis. Compositional analysis by HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS revealed the presence of flavan-3-ols (catechin, epicatechin and their derivatives), flavones (apigenin derivatives) and flavonols (glycosides of quercetin and kaempferol), among others.

The plsC/plsX-overexpressing (OX + XC) strain produced high lipid content of about 24.3%w/dcw under normal condition and was further enhanced up to 39.1%w/dcw by acetate induction. This OX + XC engineered strain was capable of decreasing phaA transcript level which related to poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis under acetate treatment. Moreover, the expression level of gene transcripts revealed that the plsX- and plsC/plsX-overexpression strains had also increased accA transcript amounts which involved in the irreversible carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA.

We also measured the presence of MS, insulin resistance with the homeostasis model assessment, and interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein concentrations in the adolescents.MS was present in 25% of the overweight adolescents but in none of the normal-weight adolescents. Compared with overweight adolescents, normal-weight adolescents had lower saturated FAs (SFAs) in both phospholipids (P < 0.001) and CEs (P < 0.01) and higher docosahexaenoic  in phospholipids (P < 0.001). In overweight subjects, FA composition was associated with MS features independent of body fat. The odds ratios of MS for a 0.1 increase in the ratio of polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) to SFAs (PUFA:SFA) were 0.91 in phospholipids (P = 0.03) and 0.90 in CEs (P = 0.06).

PAL decreased -dependent AKT activation and glucose uptake and increased the synthesis of ceramides and diglycerides (DG) derivatives, leading to protein kinase Cθ activation. EPA and DHA, but not ALA, prevented PAL-decreased AKT activation but glucose uptake was restored to control values by all n-3PUFA vs. PAL. Total DG and ceramide contents were decreased by all n-3PUFA, but only EPA and DHA increased PAL β-oxidation, decreased PAL incorporation into DG and reduced protein kinase Cθ activation. EPA and DHA emerge as better candidates than ALA to improve fatty  metabolism in skeletal muscle cells, notably via their ability to increase mitochondrial β-oxidation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of modifying dietary n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio from plant and animal oil sources on performance, behavior, cytokine mRNA expression, antioxidative status and meat fatty  profile of broiler chickens. Birds ( = 420) were fed 7 diets enriched with different dietary oil sources and ratios as follows: sunflower oil in control diet (C); fish oil (FO); 1:1 ratio of sunflower oil to FO (C1FO1); 3:1 ratio of sunflower oil to fish oil (C3FO1); linseed oil (LO); 1:1 ratio of sunflower oil to linseed oil (C1LO1); 3:1 ratio of sunflower oil to linseed oil (C3LO1), resulting in dietary n-6:n-3 ratios of approximately 40:1, 1.5:1, 4:1, 8:1, 1:1, 2.5:1 and 5:1, respectively. The best final body weight, feed conversion ratio as well as protein efficiency ratio of broilers were recorded in the C1FO1 and C1LO1 groups.

Narrowing the dietary n-6:n-3 ratio increased ( < 0.05) n-3 PUFA content of breast meat. Moreover, the breast meat contents of eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  increased ( < 0.05) with increasing dietary FO whereas α- content was higher with LO supplementation. Also, enriching the diets with n-3 PUFA from FO and LO clearly decreased ( < 0.05) serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and very low-density lipoproteins and enhanced antioxidative status. The feeding frequency was decreased ( < 0.05) in the C1FO1 and C1LO1 groups. Likewise, n-3 PUFA-enriched diets enhanced the frequency of preening, wing flapping and flightiness. Animal oil source addition, compared to plant oil, to broiler diets enhanced the relative mRNA expression of interferon gamma, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-2 and interleukin-6 genes, especially at low n-6:n-3 ratios.

However, the mechanism underlying the ability of trees to survive bark beetle outbreaks is unknown, but likely involve phytochemicals such as monoterpenes and fatty acids that can drive beetle aggregation and  on their hosts. Thus, we conducted a field survey of beetle-resistant lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trees to retrospectively deduce whether these phytochemicals underlie their survival by comparing their chemistry to that of non-attacked trees in the same stands. We also compared beetle attack characteristics between resistant and beetle-killed trees. Beetle-killed trees had more beetle attacks and longer ovipositional galleries than resistant trees, which also lacked the larval establishment found in beetle-killed trees. Resistant trees contained high amounts of toxic and attraction-inhibitive compounds and low amounts of pheromone-precursor and synergist compounds. During beetle host aggregation and , these compounds likely served three critical roles in tree survival. First, low amounts of pheromone-precursor (α-pinene) and synergist (mycrene, terpinolene) compounds reduced or prevented beetles from attracting conspecifics to residual trees. Second, high amounts of 4-allyanisole further inhibited beetle attraction to its pheromone. Finally, high amounts of toxic limonene, 3-carene, 4-allyanisole, α-, and linoleic  inhibited beetle gallery establishment and oviposition.

The pulse flours were added to low-fat beef burgers at 6% and measured for consumer acceptability and physicochemical properties. Micronization at 130 °C significantly decreased LOX activity for both flours. The lentil flour micronized at 150 °C showed a further significant decrease in LOX activity similar to that of the chickpea flour at 150 °C. The lowering of VOCs was accomplished more successfully with micronization at 130 °C for chickpea flour while micronization at 150 °C for the green lentil flour was more effective. Micronization minimally affected the characteristic   content in each flour but significantly increased omega-3 and n-6   at 150 °C in burgers with lentil and chickpea flours, respectively. Burgers with green lentil flour micronized at 130 and 150 °C, and chickpea flour micronized at 150 °C were positively associated with acceptability.

However, few studies have examined the biological effect of  (PNA; 5,9,12-18:3), the main fatty acid in pine seed oil. In this study, using murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells as a model, we examined the effect of PNA on polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) , prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. Results showed that PNA was readily taken up, incorporated and elongated to form eicosatrienoic acid (ETrA, 7,11,14-20:3) in macrophage cells. A small portion of this elongated metabolite was further elongated to form 9,13,16-22:3. The degree of incorporation of PNA and its metabolites into cellular phospholipids varied with the length of incubation time and the concentration of PNA in the medium. Incubation of PNA also modified the fatty acid profile of phospholipids: the levels of 18- and 20-carbon PUFA were significantly decreased, whereas those of 22-carbon fatty acids increased. This finding suggests that PNA enhances the elongation of 20-carbon fatty acids to 22-carbon fatty acids. The syntheses of PGE(1) from dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA, 8,11,14-20:4) and PGE(2) from arachidonic acid (ARA, 5,8,11,14-20:4) were also suppressed by the presence of PNA and its metabolite. As the expression of COX-2 was not suppressed, the inhibitory effect of PNA on PG activity was attributed in part to substrate competition between the PNA metabolite (i.e., 7,11,14-20:3) and DGLA (or ARA).</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25465559>Probiotic administration modifies the milk   profile, intestinal morphology, and intestinal   profile of goats.</a></h2><p>The effect of a mixture of potentially probiotic bacteria (MPPB; Lactobacillus reuteri DDL 19, Lactobacillus alimentarius DDL 48, Enterococcus faecium DDE 39, and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains) on the milk   (FA) profile, with emphasis on cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) in the middle stage of goat lactation, was determined. In addition, the effects of MPPB feeding on the FA profile in intestinal content and intestinal morphology in weaned goats were analyzed. The probiotic supplement was able to modify FA composition of milk and intestinal content. The unsaturated FA concentrations in milk (g of FA/L of milk) increased from 4.49 to 7.86 for oleic (18:1), from 0.70 to 1.39 for linoleic (18:2), from 0.063 to 0.187 for  (18:3) , and from 0.093 to 0.232 for CLA. The atherogenicity index diminished 2-fold after MPPB ingestion. In the intestinal content of the weaned goats, no significant difference in saturated FA concentration compared with the control was observed. However, oleic , , CLA, and docosahexaenoic  concentrations increased by 81, 23, 344, and 74%, respectively, after probiotic consumption. The ruminal production of CLA was increased by the MPPB. However, bacterial strains of MPPB were unable to produce CLA in culture media. By histological techniques, it was observed that the treated group had intestinally more conserved morphological structures than the control group. The results obtained in this study indicate that the MPPB administration in lactating and weaned goats allows for the production of milk with improved concentrations of beneficial compounds, and also produces a protective effect in the goat intestine.

However, the biological mechanisms underlying these effects have not been elucidated. In this work, the effect of oral supplementation of ALA from chia (Salvia hispanica L.) seed oil and anthocyanins from a purple corn extract (PCE) on gene expression of SREBP-1c, PPAR-α and Δ5 and Δ6 desaturases (Δ5D and Δ6D), the activity of these enzymes in the liver as well as the hepatic  profile were evaluated in thirty-six female Sprague Dawley rats whose diet was supplemented with olive oil (OL), chia oil (CH), olive oil and PCE (OL + PCE) or chia oil and PCE (CH + PCE). Gene expression of PPAR-α was significantly higher when supplemented with CH and CH + PCE, SREBP-1c gene expression was higher when supplemented with chia oil. CH supplementation enhanced Δ5D expression whereas no significant differences between treatments were observed concerning Δ6D gene expression. Activities of both desaturases were increased by including olive oil (OL + PCE and OL), and they were found to be higher in CH + PCE respect to CH for both enzymes. The ALA and n-3 LCPUFAs hepatic content was higher with CH, decreasing the levels of AA and n-6 LCPUFAs. It is concluded that the joint action of flavonoids such as anthocyanins and ALA show an anti-adipogenic effect. Desaturase activity was inhibited by ALA and kept by the anthocyanins from PCE, thus anthocyanins would exert a protective effect on the desaturase activity but they would not affect on its gene expression, however, high doses of ALA increased the production of its metabolites, masking the effect of PCE.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Some of the effects of omega-3 PUFA are brought about by modulation of the amount and types of eicosanoids made, and other effects are elicited by eicosanoid-independent mechanisms, including actions upon intracellular signaling pathways, transcription factor activity and gene expression. Animal experiments and clinical intervention studies indicate that omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and, therefore, might be useful in the management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Coronary heart disease, major depression, aging and cancer are characterized by an increased level of interleukin 1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine. Similarly, arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and lupus erythematosis are autoimmune diseases characterized by a high level of IL-1 and the proinflammatory leukotriene LTB(4) produced by omega-6 fatty acids.

The wastewater contained high concentrations of solids, starch and nutrients. Sterilization of the potato processing wastewater resulted in a thick gelatinized medium, causing the fungi to grow slow. In order to overcome this problem, the wastewater was diluted with tap water at three dilution ratios (25%, 50% and 75% before fermentation). Dilution of the wastewater not only enhanced lipid production, starch utilization and amylase secretion but also COD and nutrient removal. The dilution ratio of 25% was found to be optimum for lipid production and the maximum lipid concentration obtained was 3.5 g/L. Lipid accumulation was influenced by amylase secretion, and the amylase activity was up to 53.5 IU/mL at 25% dilution.

In the present study we envisage a novel concept for  therapy, devoted to the development of innovative lipid nanostructured formulas with improved gastric tolerability and enhanced specificity in adipose cells targeting. For this purpose, an anti- herbal active from red pepper extract - Capsaicin (Cap) and an endogenous lipid regulator of appetite - oleoylethanolamide (OEA) or a structural analogue of OEA - Phenylalaninol oleamide (PAO), are simultaneously integrated within the same delivery system - nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) prepared with linseed oil that has anti-inflammatory and hypotriglyceridemic properties. The NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap presented mean diameters under 200 nm, size that allow an efficient uptake of actives by enterocytes and lead to an extended biological action of all actives - Cap, OEA/PAO and . NLC revealed a polidispersity index ranging from 0.16 to 0.22, which represents a narrow dispersion around mean size and suggests an adequate unimodal behavior. The two types of NLC co-loaded with Cap and OEA/PAO were both negatively charged, with zeta potentials of -42.8 mV and -58.5 mV that offered a guarantee for an excellent stability of NLC in time. Despite to the competition between the accommodations of both actives into the lipid core of nanocarriers, the entrapment efficiency exceeds 92% for OEA/PAO and is ranged between 71 and 82% for Cap. In the presence of NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap, ABTS inhibition proceeded in a Capsaicin concentration dependent manner and was dependent on the type of NLC formulation. A remarkable radical-scavenging activity against ABTS was determined for Cap and OEA based-NLC. The in vitro release demonstrated that NLC played an important role on the delay of Cap dissolution; the NLC have ensured a slow release of Cap, eg only 21% Cap was released after 24 h of in vitro experiments. The in vivo pharmacological evaluation has revealed that the NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap treatment resulted in a body weight decrease and improves the lipid and glucose profile, as compared to the obese mice batch.  mice treated with NLC-OEA exhibited a weight loss of ~15% and ~10% weight loss for NLC-POA, after 10-days treatment. Administration of NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap to the Albino Swiss mice led to significant decrease of glucose level (e.g. 117.4 mg/dL for NLC-OEA-Cap treated mice versus 213.9 mg/dL for obese mice batch) and exhibited a desired decrease effect of triglyceride (e.g. 71.1 mg/dL for NLC-OEA-Cap versus 129.5, for obese batch). Moreover, the cholesterol values have been lowered to almost half from the value determined for the control batches. Overall, study highlights that using appropriate lipid mediators in association with an herbal anti- active, both formulated into lipid nanocarriers, could enhance the therapeutic response in the  treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The delta(13)C(bulk), delta(2)H(bulk), and delta(18)O(bulk) values were determined by continuous flow combustion and high-temperature conversion elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA/IRMS, TC-EA/IRMS). The delta(13)C(FA) values were determined using gas chromatography--combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS). For comparison, other C(3) vegetable oils rich in  (flax and false flax oils) and rich in linoleic  (poppy, sunflower, and safflower oils) were submitted to the same chemical and isotopic analyses. The bulk and molecular delta(13)C values were typical for C(3) plants. The delta(13)C value of palmitic  (delta(13)C(16:0)) and n-3  (delta(13)C(18:3n-3)) differed (p < 0.001) between rape, flax, and poppy oils. Also within species, significant differences of delta(13)C(FA) were observed (p < 0.01). The hydrogen and  isotope compositions of rape oil differed between cultivars (p < 0.05). Major differences in the individual delta(13)C(FA) values were found. A plant-specific carbon isotope fractionation occurs during the biosynthesis of the fatty acids and particularly during desaturation of C(18) acids in rape and flax.

Relatively little is also known about how the minor n-6 PUFAs-γ- (GLA), dihomo-γ- (DGLA), and arachidonic  (AA)-relate to mortality risk.We investigated the associations of serum n-6 PUFAs, an objective biomarker of exposure, with risk of death in middle-aged and older men and whether disease history modifies the associations.We included 2480 men from the prospective Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, aged 42-60 y at baseline in 1984-1989. The stratified analyses by baseline disease status included 1019 men with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, or  and 1461 men without a history of disease.During the mean follow-up of 22.4 y, 1143 deaths due to disease occurred. Of these, 575 were CVD deaths, 317 were cancer deaths, and 251 were other-cause deaths. A higher serum LA concentration was associated with a lower risk of death from any cause (multivariable-adjusted HR for the highest compared with the lowest quintile: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.71; P-trend < 0.001) and with deaths due to CVD (extreme-quintile HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.74; P-trend < 0.001) and non-CVD or noncancer causes (HR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.76; P-trend = 0.001). Serum AA had similar, although weaker, inverse associations. Serum GLA and DGLA were not associated with risk of death, and none of the fatty acids were associated with cancer mortality. The results were generally similar among those with or without a history of major chronic disease (P-interaction > 0.13).Our findings showed an inverse association of a higher biomarker of LA intake with total and CVD mortality and little concern for risk, thus supporting the current dietary recommendations to increase LA intake for CVD prevention. The finding of an inverse association of serum AA with the risk of death needs replication in other populations.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129605>Creation of a database to assess effects of omega-3, omega-6 and total polyunsaturated fats on health: methodology for a set of systematic reviews.</a></h2><p>To create a database of long-term randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing higher with lower omega-3, omega-6 or total polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), regardless of reported outcomes, and to develop methods to assess effects of increasing omega-6,  (ALA), long-chain omega-3 (LCn3) and total PUFA on health outcomes.Systematic review search, methodology and meta-analyses.Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov and trials in relevant systematic reviews.RCTs of ≥24 weeks' duration assessing effects of increasing ALA, LCn3, omega-6 or total PUFAs, regardless of outcomes reported.Methods included random-effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses.

High SFA intakes have been associated with increased CVD and type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk, due to alterations in cholesterol homoeostasis and adipose tissue inflammation. PUFA, in particular EPA and DHA, have been associated with health benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects. It is well established that dietary fat composition plays an important role in biological processes. A recent review of evidence suggests that replacement of SFA with PUFA has potential to reduce risk of CVD and T2D. The public health and molecular impact of EPA and DHA have been well-characterised, while less is known of effects of α- (ALA). The current dietary guideline for ALA is 0·5% TE; however evidence from supplementation trials suggests that benefit is observed at levels greater than 2 g/d (0·6-1% TE). This review highlights the gap in the evidence base relating to effects of the replacement of SFA with ALA, identifying the need for randomised controlled trials to determine the optimal dose of ALA substitution to define the efficacy of dietary fat modification with ALA.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'energy', 'inflammation', 'insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30622622>Maternal dietary ratio of linoleic  to  during pregnancy has sex-specific effects on placental and fetal weights in the rat.</a></h2><p>Increased consumption of linoleic  (LA, omega-6) in Western diets coupled with the pro-inflammatory and adipogenic properties of its derivatives has led to suggestions that fetal exposure to this dietary pattern could be contributing to the intergenerational cycle of .This study aimed to evaluate the effects of maternal consumption of a LA to  (ALA) ratio similar to modern Western diets (9:1) compared to a lower ratio (1:1.5) on placental and fetal growth, and to determine any cumulative effects by feeding both diets at two total fat levels (18% vs 36% fat w/w). Female Wistar rats ( = 5-7/group) were assigned to one of the four experimental diets prior to mating until 20d of gestation.Fatty  profiles of maternal and fetal blood and placental tissue at 20d gestation were different between dietary groups, and largely reflected dietary fatty  composition. Female fetuses were heavier (2.98 ± 0.06 g vs 3.36 ± 0.07 g,  < 0.01) and male placental weight was increased (0.51 ± 0.02 g vs 0.58 ± 0.02 g,  < 0.05) in the low LA:ALA groups.

Five Nordic Red cows fitted with rumen cannulas were used in a 5 × 5 Latin square with five 28-d periods. Treatments comprised total mixed rations based on grass silage with a forage-to-concentrate ratio of 60:40 supplemented with no lipid (CO) or 50 g/kg of diet dry matter (DM) of myristic  (MA), rapeseed oil (RO), safflower oil (SO), or linseed oil (LO). Feeding MA resulted in the lowest DM intake, and feeding RO reduced DM intake compared with CO. Feeding MA reduced the yields of milk, milk constituents, and -corrected milk. Plant oils did not influence yields of milk and milk constituents, but reduced milk protein content compared with CO. Treatments had no effect on rumen fermentation characteristics, other than an increase in ammonia-N concentration due to feeding MA, RO, and SO compared with CO. Lipid supplements reduced daily ruminal CH emission; however, the response was to some extent a result of lower feed intake. Lipids modified microbial community structure without affecting total counts of bacteria, archaea, and ciliate protozoa. Dietary treatments had no effect on the apparent total tract digestibility of organic matter, fiber, and gross . Treatments did not affect either  secreted in milk as a proportion of  intake or efficiency of dietary N utilization. All lipids lowered de novo fatty  synthesis in the mammary gland. Plant oils increased proportions of milk fat 18:0, cis 18:1, trans and monounsaturated fatty acids, and decreased saturated fatty acids compared with CO and MA. Both SO and LO increased the proportion of total polyunsaturated fatty acids, total conjugated , and cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic . Feeding MA clearly increased the Δ desaturation of fatty acids. Our results provide compelling evidence that plant oils supplemented to a grass silage-based diet reduce ruminal CH emission and milk saturated fatty acids, and increase the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids and total conjugated linoleic  while not interfering with digestibility, rumen fermentation, rumen microbial quantities, or milk production.The Authors.

However, limited information is available regarding the effect of ground flaxseed on dry matter intake (DMI), ruminal fermentation, and nutrient utilization in grazing dairy cows. Twenty multiparous Jersey cows averaging (mean ± standard deviation) 111 ± 49 d in milk in the beginning of the study were used in a randomized complete block design to investigate the effects of supplementing herbage (i.e., grazed forage) with ground corn-soybean meal mix (control diet = CTRL) or ground flaxseed (flaxseed diet = FLX) on animal production, milk FA, ruminal , and nutrient digestibility. The study was conducted from June to September 2013, with data and sample collection taking place on wk 4, 8, 12, and 16. Cows were fed a diet formulated to yield a 60:40 forage-to-concentrate ratio consisting of (dry matter basis): 40% cool-season perennial herbage, 50% partial total mixed ration, and 10% of ground corn-soybean meal mix or 10% ground flaxseed. However, estimated herbage DMI averaged 5.59 kg/d or 34% of the total DMI. Significant treatment by week interactions were observed for milk and blood urea N, and several milk FA (e.g., trans-10 18:1). No significant differences between treatments were observed for herbage and total DMI, milk yield, feed efficiency, concentrations and yields of milk components, and urinary excretion of purine derivatives. Total-tract digestibility of organic matter decreased, whereas that of neutral detergent fiber increased with feeding FLX versus CTRL. No treatment effects were observed for ruminal concentrations of total volatile FA and NH-N, and ruminal proportions of acetate and propionate. Ruminal butyrate tended to decrease, and the acetate-to-propionate ratio decreased in the FLX diet. Most saturated and unsaturated FA in milk  were changed. Specifically, milk proportion of cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3, Σn-3 FA, and Σ18C FA increased, whereas that of cis-9,cis-12 18:2, Σn-6 FA, Σ odd-chain FA, Σ<16C FA, and Σ16C FA decreased with feeding FLX versus the CTRL diet. In conclusion, feeding FLX did not change yields of milk and milk components, but increased milk n-3 FA. Therefore, costs and industry adoption of premiums for n-3-enriched milk will determine the adoption of ground flaxseed in pasture-based dairy farms.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The results showed that EQ and extracts of Angelica sinensis (EAs) inhibited  oxidation in material above. Of all of the examined EAs, EAE showed the strongest protective effects against the  oxidation. Moreover, EAE at high concentrations showed a stronger inhibitory effect on  oxidation than that of EQ. Next, 7 experimental diets that respectively supplemented 0.0, 0.2, 0.8 and 3.2 g kg of EQ and EAE were fed to 280 juvenile red carp (Cyprinus carpio var. xingguonensis) with seven treatment groups for 30 days. The results indicated that dietary EAE improved growth performance in carp. Moreover, dietary EAE increased the activities of trypsin, lipase, alpha-amylase, alkaline phosphatase, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and decreased plasma ammonia content in carp. Meanwhile, dietary EAE reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and raised the activities of anti-superoxide anion, anti-hydroxyl radical, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase and the content of reduced glutathione in the hepatopancreas and intestine of carp. However, with the exception of GPT, dietary EQ got the opposite results to dietary EAE in carp. These results revealed that dietary EAE improved the digestive, absorptive and antioxidant capacities in fish. However, dietary EQ inhibited the digestive, absorptive and antioxidant capacities in fish. So, EAE could be used as a natural antioxidant for replacing EQ in fish feeds.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26255030>Protective Effect of Unsaturated Fatty Acids on Palmitic -Induced Toxicity in Skeletal Muscle Cells is not Mediated by PPARδ Activation.</a></h2><p>Unsaturated free fatty acids (FFA) are able to prevent deleterious effects of saturated FFA in skeletal muscle cells although the mechanisms involved are still not completely understood. FFA act as endogenous ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), transcription factors regulating the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine whether activation of PPARδ, the most common PPAR subtype in skeletal muscle, plays a role in mediating the protective effect of unsaturated FFA on saturated FFA-induced damage in skeletal muscle cells and to examine an impact on mitochondrial respiration. Mouse C2C12 myotubes were treated for 24 h with different concentrations of saturated FFA (palmitic ), unsaturated FFA (oleic, linoleic and α-), and their combinations. PPARδ agonist GW501516 and antagonist GSK0660 were also used. Both mono- and polyunsaturated FFA, but not GW501516, prevented palmitic -induced cell death. Mono- and polyunsaturated FFA proved to be effective activators of PPARδ compared to saturated palmitic ; however, in combination with palmitic  their effect on PPARδ activation was blocked and stayed at the levels observed for palmitic  alone. Unsaturated FFA at moderate physiological concentrations as well as GW501516, but not palmitic , mildly uncoupled mitochondrial respiration. Our results indicate that although unsaturated FFA are effective activators of PPARδ, their protective effect on palmitic -induced toxicity is not mediated by PPARδ activation and subsequent induction of lipid regulatory genes in skeletal muscle cells. Other mechanisms, such as mitochondrial uncoupling, may underlie their effect.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30078159>Eicosanoids in prostate cancer.</a></h2><p>Many epidemiological studies revealed an association of dietary consumption of fatty acids and prostate cancer.

Hempseed has been used as a treatment for these diseases in Korean and Chinese folk medicine. The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of hempseed oil (HO) on MH7A human RA fibroblast-like synovial cells.MH7A cells were used to study the anti-rheumatoid effects of hempseed (Cannabis sativa L., cv. Cheungsam/Cannabaceae) oil by investigating cell viability, apoptosis, lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis.HO treatment reduced the survival rate of MH7A cells and promoted apoptotic cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Both lipid accumulation and the level of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) increased in HO-treated MH7A cells. Co-treatment with the antioxidant Tiron effectively abrogated the cytotoxic effects of HO; the ROS level was reduced, cell viability was recovered, and apoptotic cell death was significantly diminished. Moreover, HO-treated cells exhibited increased expression of the major ER stress markers, glucose-regulated protein 78 and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). The siRNA-mediated knockdown of CHOP prevented HO-induced apoptosis.Our results suggest that HO treatment induced lipid accumulation, ROS production, CHOP expression, and apoptosis in MH7A cells, and that CHOP functions as an anti-rheumatoid factor downstream of HO in MH7A cells.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, we investigated the effects of supplementation of several polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on the AA concentration of the PI fraction using a cultured cell system. Neither alpha-linolenic acid nor eicosapentaenoic acid supplement reduced the level of AA in PI of HepG2 cells. In contrast to the n-3 series PUFAs, adding podocarpic acid (20:3, Delta-5,11,14) and  (18:3, Delta-5,9,12) reduced the AA content of the PI fraction from a control value of 15.9% to 7.0 and 8.7%, respectively.

ALA did not reduce total body fat but induced lipid redistribution away from the abdominal area and favorably improved glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and left ventricular dimensions, contractility, volumes and stiffness. EPA and DHA increased sympathetic activation, reduced the abdominal adiposity and total body fat and attenuated insulin sensitivity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and left ventricular stiffness but not glucose tolerance. However, ALA, EPA and DHA all reduced inflammation in both the heart and the liver, cardiac fibrosis and hepatic steatosis. These effects were associated with complete suppression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 activity.

The transcriptomic and proteomic changes that occur after GA4 treatment have been reported previously; however, the metabolic changes brought about by GA4 remain unknown. The present study was undertaken to assess changes in metabolites in response to GA4 treatment, as determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and principal component analysis. Fifty-five metabolites that exhibited more than two-fold differences in abundance (P < 0.05) between samples collected over time after a given treatment or between samples exposed to different treatments were studied further. These metabolites were categorized into six main groups: amino acids and their isoforms (10), amino  derivatives (7), sugars and polyols (14), organic acids (12), fatty acids (4), and others (8). All of these groups are involved in various metabolic pathways, in particular galactose metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and starch and sucrose metabolism. These results suggested that  metabolism is important at the metabolic level in dormancy release following GA4 treatment.

A unicellular green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii also accumulates PA and CA in a betain lipid. The expressed sequence tag (EST) resource of C. reinhardtii led to the isolation of a cDNA clone that encoded a putative fatty acid desaturase named as CrDES containing a cytochrome b5 domain at the N-terminus. When the coding sequence was expressed heterologously in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, PA and CA were newly detected and comparable amounts of LA and ALA were reduced, demonstrating that CrDES has Delta(5)-desaturase activity for both LA and ALA. CrDES expressed in the yeast showed Delta(5)-desaturase activity on 18:1Delta(9) but not 18:1Delta(11).

The mere estimation of the fluorescing lipid fraction in parallel with the other endogenous fluorophores, and with the common biochemical and histochemical biomarkers of tissue injury has been exploited to investigate the liver morpho-functional conditions in experimental hepatology. More interestingly, the fluorescing lipid fraction is greatly relatable to free fatty acids such as arachidonic, linoleic and , which are deserving increasing attention as precursors of products involved in several and complex signaling pathways.

Although both wild type and Elovl2 mice were able to generate efficient M1 and M2 macrophages, M1 cells derived from Elovl2 mice showed an increased expression of key markers (iNOS, CD86 and MARCO) and cytokines (IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23).

Hence, impairment of systemic DHA synthesis delineates an alteration of M1/M2 macrophages both in vitro and in vivo, with M1 being hyperactive and more pro-inflammatory while M2 less protective, supporting the view that DHA has a key role in controlling the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory processes.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23748896>Determination of tolerable fatty acids and cholera toxin concentrations using human intestinal epithelial cells and BALB/c mouse macrophages.</a></h2><p>The positive role of fatty acids in the prevention and alleviation of non-human and human diseases have been and continue to be extensively documented.

Rats fed HFHF diet with n-6:n-3 ratio of 200 resulted in hepatic steatosis, induced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and oxidative stress accompanied by increase in markers of inflammation, plasma lipids and aminotransferase levels. Histopathological examination of liver further confirmed the establishment of NASH. ALA and LC n-3 PUFA supplementation prevented hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia by inhibiting  and increasing insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, n-3 PUFA supplementation attenuated hepatic oxidative stress by restoring antioxidant status, decreased inflammation and preserved hepatic architecture. These finding suggest that decreasing n-6:n-3 ratio prevented HFHF induced NASH by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><p>Keyword:['NASH', 'inflammation', 'insulin resistance', 'lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30718141>Circulating n-3 fatty acids and linoleic  as indicators of dietary fatty  intake in post-myocardial infarction patients.</a></h2><p>Population-based studies often use plasma fatty acids (FAs) as objective indicators of FA intake, especially for n-3 FA and linoleic  (LA). The relation between dietary and circulating FA in cardiometabolic patients is largely unknown. We examined whether dietary n-3 FA and LA were reflected in plasma lipid pools in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients.Patients in Alpha Omega Cohort filled out a 203-item food-frequency questionnaire from which eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA),  (ALA), and LA intake were calculated. Circulating individual FA (% total FA) were assessed in cholesteryl esters (CE; n = 4066), phospholipids (PL; n = 838), and additionally in total plasma for DHA and LA (n = 739). Spearman correlation coefficients (r) were calculated for dietary vs. circulating FA. Circulating FA were also compared across dietary FA quintiles, overall and in subgroups by sex, , diabetes, statin use, and high alcohol intake. Patients were on average 69 years old and 79% was male. Moderate correlations between dietary and circulating levels were observed for EPA (r∼0.4 in CE and PL) and DHA (r ∼0.5 in CE and PL, ∼0.4 in total plasma), but not for ALA (r ∼0.0). Weak correlations were observed for LA (r 0.1 to 0.2). Plasma LA was significantly lower in statin users and in patients with a high alcohol intake.In post-MI patients, dietary EPA and DHA were well reflected in circulating levels. This was not the case for LA, which may partly be influenced by alcohol use and statins.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Refined corn oil is composed of 99% triacylglycerols with polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) 59%, monounsaturated fatty  24%, and saturated fatty  (SFA) 13%. The PUFA is linoleic  (C18:2n-6) primarily, with a small amount of  (C18:3n-3) giving a n-6/n-3 ratio of 83. Corn oil contains a significant amount of ubiquinone and high amounts of alpha- and gamma-tocopherols (vitamin E) that protect it from oxidative rancidity. It has good sensory qualities for use as a salad and cooking oil. Corn oil is highly digestible and provides energy and essential fatty acids (EFA). Linoleic  is a dietary essential that is necessary for integrity of the skin, cell membranes, the immune system, and for synthesis of icosanoids. Icosanoids are necessary for reproductive, cardiovascular, renal, and gastrointestinal functions and resistance to disease. Corn oil is a highly effective food oil for lowering serum cholesterol. Because of its low content of SFAs which raises cholesterol and its high content of PUFAs which lowers cholesterol, consumption of corn oil can replace SFAs with PUFAs, and the combination is more effective in lowering cholesterol than simple reduction of SFA. PUFA primarily lowers low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) which is atherogenic. Research shows that PUFA has little effect on high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) which is protective against atherosclerosis. PUFA generally improves the ratio of LDL-C to HDL-C. Studies in animals show that PUFA is required for the growth of cancers; the amount required is considered to be greater than that which satisfies the EFA requirement of the host. At this time there is no indication from epidemiological studies that PUFA intake is associated with increased risk of breast or colon cancer, which have been suggested to be promoted by high-fat diets in humans. Recommendations for minimum PUFA intake to prevent gross EFA deficiency are about 3% of energy (en%). Recommendations for prevention of heart disease are 8-10 en%. Consumption of PUFA in the United States is 5-7 en%. The use of corn oil to contribute to a PUFA intake of 10 en% in the diet would be beneficial to heart health. No single source of salad or cooking oil provides an optimum fatty  (FA) composition. Many questions remain to be answered about the relation of FA composition of the diet to various physiological functions and disease processes.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316924>Effect of nutrients and exhaustive exercise on brain function.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological evidence suggests that health-oriented eating habits are associated with maintaining optimal cognitive ability.

Endurance physical exercise and  restriction was also recognized of cardiovascular stress adjustment by enhancing brainstem cholinergic activity as well as brain function. However, we even do not know the exact neuronal mechanisms about the nutrients, β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) and myokine impacts on brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) activation. Therefore, this review focuses on recent evidence that explains how nutrients and prolonged exercise can affect nervous system pathways that are associated with improving brain function. The results revealed that frequent consumption of polyphenols and n-3 PUFAs could modify gastrointestinal environment with beneficial microorganisms. It may suggest a new hypothesis that gastrointestinal microbiome could influence cognitive function in addition to the traditional etiological pathway. And moreover, prolonged physical exercise includes open skill sports which is induced by β-oxidation of free fatty acids stimulate BDNF. And also β-HB production which is induced by carbohydrate depletion, hypoglycemia, or fasting stimulate BDNF production that acts an significantly important roles in cognitive function and acting on brain function with brain metabolism.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576253>Liver slice culture as a model for  in fish.</a></h2><p>Hepatic  is traditionally investigated in vitro using hepatocyte monocultures lacking the complex three-dimensional structure and interacting cell types essential liver function.

Recent studies indicated that the modification of gut microbiota plays an important role in the progression from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated consumption of fish oil or perilla oil rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) protects against NAFLD. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we adopted 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing technique to investigate the impacts of fish oil and perilla oil on gut microbiomes modification in rats with high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced NAFLD. Both fish oil and perilla oil ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and . In comparison with the low-fat control diet, HFD feeding significantly reduced the relative abundance of Gram-positive bacteria in the gut, which was slightly reversed by either fish oil or perilla oil. Additionally, fish oil and perilla oil consumption abrogated the elevated abundance of Prevotella and Escherichia in the gut from HFD fed animals. Interestingly, the relative abundance of antiobese Akkermansia was remarkably increased only in animals fed fish oil compared with HFD group.

The aim of this study was to explore the effects of linoleic , , and gamma- (GLA), 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), on palmitic  (PA)-induced inflammatory responses and IR in C2C12 myotubes. Our data demonstrated that these three test 18-carbon PUFAs can inhibit PA-induced interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and IR as evidenced by increases in phosphorylated AKT and the 160-kD AKT substrate, mRNA and plasma membrane protein expression of glucose transporter 4, and glucose uptake. Moreover, the 18-carbon PUFAs blocked the effects of PA on activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Of note, supplementation with GLA-rich borage oil decreased proinflammatory cytokine production and hindered the activation of MAPKs, PKC-θ and NF-κB in the skeletal muscles of diabetic mice. The 18-carbon PUFAs did not reverse PA-induced inflammation or IR in C2C12 myotubes transfected with a constitutively active mutant IκB kinase-β plasmid, which suggests the importance of the inhibition of NF-κB activation by the 18-carbon PUFAs. Moreover, blockade of AMPK activation by short hairpin RNA annulled the inhibitory effects of the 18-carbon PUFAs on PA-induced IR but not inflammation.

The present study examined egg consumption and associations with nutrient intakes, markers of growth and weight-related measures in infants 6⁻24 months of age ( = 561) compared to infant egg non-consumers ( = 2129). Egg consumers were defined as those infants consuming eggs (i.e., with the exclusion of mixed dishes) during a 24-h dietary recall. Associations with nutrient intakes and markers of growth variables were evaluated using data from What We Eat in America, the dietary component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001⁻2012. Mean  and nutrient intakes were adjusted for the sample design using appropriate survey parameters and sample weights. Egg consumption was associated with greater  intake compared to infants not consuming eggs (1265 ± 27 vs. 1190 ± 14 kcal/day;  = 0.01). Infant consumers of eggs also had greater protein (48 ± 0.7 vs. 41 ± 0.4 g/day), total choline (281 ± 6 vs. 163 ± 2 mg/day), lutein + zeaxanthin (788 ± 64 vs. 533 ± 23 mcg/day), α- (0.87 ± 0.02 vs. 0.82 ± 0.01 g/day), docosahexaenoic  (DHA) (0.04 ± 0.02 vs. 0.02 ± 0.001 g/day), vitamin B12 (4.2 ± 0.1 vs. 3.7 ± 0.1 mcg/day), phosphorus (977 ± 15 vs. 903 ± 8 mg/day), and selenium (67 ± 1 vs. 52 ± 0.6 mcg/day; all -values < 0.05). Egg consumers also had greater consumption of total fat (50 ± 0.7 vs. 45 ± 0.3 g/day), monounsaturated fat (17 ± 0.3 vs. 15 ± 0.1 g/day), saturated fat (20 ± 0.4 vs. 18 ± 0.2 g/day), and sodium (1663 ± 36 vs. 1418 ± 19 mg/day), with lower added sugar (4.7 ± 0.3 vs. 6.1 ± 0.2 tsp eq/day), and total sugar (87 ± 2 vs. 99 ± 1 g/day; all -values < 0.05) vs. non-consumers of eggs. Egg consumption was also associated with lower intake of dietary folate, iron, magnesium and niacin relative to non-consumers of eggs. Egg consumption in infants was associated with longer recumbent length when compared to non-consumers of eggs (79.2 ± 0.2 vs. 78.7 ± 0.1 cm;  = 0.03). No associations were observed when comparing body weight. When compared to non-consumers of eggs and regardless of food security, poverty-income-ratio and Women, Infants and Children (WIC) supplemental nutrition status, egg consumption was associated with greater lutein + zeaxanthin intake per day. The current analyzes show that consumption of eggs in infant 6⁻24 months of age is linked with several nutrient intakes, including higher protein, lutein + zeaxanthin, choline, B12, selenium and phosphorus; and lower added and total sugars relative to non-consumers.

Migration of endothelial cells is of utmost importance for effective wound healing. In this study we investigated the effects of chlorambucil (a nitrogen mustard) on early endothelial cells (EEC) with special focus on cell migration. Chlorambucil significantly inhibited migration of EEC in Boyden chamber and wound healing experiments. Cell migration is linked to cytoskeletal organization. We therefore investigated the distribution pattern of the Golgi apparatus as a marker of cell polarity. Cells are polarized under control conditions, whereas chlorambucil caused an encircling perinuclear position of the Golgi apparatus, indicating non-polarized cells. ROS are discussed to be involved in the pathophysiology of alkylating substances and are linked to cell migration and cell polarity. Therefore we investigated the influence of ROS-scavengers (α- (ALA) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC)) on the impaired EEC migration. Both substances, in particular ALA, improved EEC migration. Notably ALA restored cell polarity. Remarkably, investigations of ROS and RNS biomarkers (8-isoprostane and nitrotyrosine) did not reveal a significant increase after chlorambucil exposure when assessed 24h post exposure. A distinct breakdown of mitochondrial membrane potential (measured by TMRM) that recovered under ALA treatment was observed. In conclusion our results provide compelling evidence that the alkylating agent chlorambucil dramatically impairs directed cellular migration, which is accompanied by perturbations of cell polarity and mitochondrial membrane potential. ALA treatment was able to reconstitute cell polarity and to stabilize mitochondrial potential resulting in improved cell migration.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The objective of present study was to verify if the supplementation of chickens' diet with grape seed oil or pomegranate seed oil influences cholesterol content and fatty acids (FA) profile in their livers. Ross 308 chickens (n = 24) were fed with fodder enriched with grape seed oil (G group) or pomegranate seed oil (P group). Diet of control group (C group) was based on soybean oil. FA analysis in livers as well as cholesterol content was made with gas chromatography. We observed significant increase in  content when part of soybean oil was replaced by grape seed oil (p = 0.0002). Its highest amount was detected in G group (4.44 ± 1.53%) whereas the lowest in C group (1.73 ± 0.53%). Applied supplementation did not change total cholesterol content. Its content ranged from 233.0 ± 12.2 mg/100 g in G group to 234.6 ± 29.7 mg1100 g in C group. However, chickens' diet modification with grape seed oil and pomegranate seed oil influenced the FA profile in livers. We detected the presence of punicic  (cis-9, trans-11, cis-13 C18:3, PA) in livers of chicken fed with pomegranate seed oil. Pomegranate seed oil is one of natural sources of conjugated  acids (CLnA), which predominate in this oil (PA >70% of all FA). However, in livers PA constituted only 0.90 ± 0.10% of all fatty acids. Furthermore, we detected substantial amounts of rumenic  (cis-9, trans-11 C18:2, RA) - the major isomer of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). Its natural sources in diet are meat and milk of ruminants, but incorporation of pomegranate seed oil into chickens' diet caused a significant increase of its share in fatty acids pool in their livers (3.73 ? 0.79% in P group in relation to 0.08 ± 0.03% in G group and 0.02 ± 0.00% in C group, p < 0.0001).

A significant increase in the n-3 HUFA score was observed, in a dose-dependent manner, after administration of the FO supplement. In terms of the impact on the n-3 HUFA score, the intake of ENCH cheese (90 g/day) for two or four weeks was equivalent to the administration of one or two FO pills, respectively. Conversely, the linseed oil intake did not significantly impact the n-3 HUFA score. Feeding ENCH cheeses from different sources (bovine, ovine and caprine) for two months improved the n-3 HUFA score by increasing plasma DHA, and the effect was proportional to the CLA content in the cheese. We suggest that the improved n-3 HUFA score resulting from ENCH cheese intake may be attributed to increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) activity.

The adrenal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, CYP17 and CYP21, are essential for glucocorticoid synthesis. The omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may ameliorate , but it is unknown whether they have direct actions on adrenal CYP steroidogenic enzymes. The aim of this study was to determine whether PUFA modify adrenal glucocorticoid synthesis using isolated porcine microsomes. The enzyme activities of CYP17, CYP21, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH), and CYP2E1 were measured in intact microsomes treated with fatty acids of disparate saturated bonds. Cortisol production was measured in a cell-free in vitro model. Microsomal lipid composition after arachidonic  (AA) exposure was determined by sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry. Results showed that adrenal microsomal CYP21 activity was decreased by docosapentaenoic  (DPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), eicosapentaenoic , α-, AA, and linoleic , and CYP17 activity was inhibited by DPA, DHA, eicosapentaenoic , and AA. Inhibition was associated with the number of the PUFA double bonds. Similarly, cortisol production in vitro was decreased by DPA, DHA, and AA. Endoplasmic enzymes with intraluminal activity were unaffected by PUFA. In microsomes exposed to AA, the level of AA or oxidative metabolites of AA in the membrane was not altered. In conclusion, these observations suggest that omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, especially those with 2 or more double bonds (DPA, DHA, and AA), impede adrenal glucocorticoid production.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359842>Application of pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) to obtain bioactive fatty acids and phenols from Laminaria ochroleuca collected in Galicia (NW Spain).</a></h2><p>The increase of pathologies like cardiovascular diseases,  or diabetes due to the nature of diet is a matter of concern in our society. Because of this, there is a high interest in healthy natural products that could prevent the appearance of such diseases. This paper aims to study the content of fatty acids (FAs) and phenolic compounds of brown alga Laminaria ochroleuca (L. ochroleuca) and to determine the nutritional quality of the lipids extracted using pressurized liquids extraction (PLE) technique. PLE was applied to the algae using four solvents of different polarity (hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol and ethanol:water 1:1). Results showed that the higher yield (52%), is obtained with ethanol: water solvent, however, both ethyl acetate and ethanol enrich unsaturated fatty  (USFA) (palmitoleic, , linoleic, oleic, araquidonic and eicosapenataenoic) in the lipid fraction of L. ochroleuca, providing extracts up to 55% of their total fatty  content compared to other solvents. The nutritional quality of the lipids in all PLE extracts was assessed by considering the ω-6/ ω-3 fatty  ratio and two dietary indexes involved in the risks of coronary heart disease, atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenic (TI). The lower (best) index values are for ethanol extract, 4.4 (ω-6/ ω-3), 0.74 (AI) and 1.05 (TI), followed of ethyl acetate, 4.4 (ω-6/ ω-3), 0.87 (AI) and 1.24 (TI). Finally, the antioxidant capacity of PLE alga extracts in terms of total phenol content (TPC) was analyzed by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The ethanol: water extracts showed the highest TPC with a concentration up to 173.65 mg eq. gallic  / g PLE extract.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different sources of FA supplementation on apparent total tract nutrient digestibility, milk yield and composition, and  balance (EB) of cows during the transition period and early lactation. We compared diets rich in C18:2 and C18:3 FA. Multiparous Holstein cows were randomly assigned to receive one of the four diets: control (n=11); whole flaxseed (WF, n=10), 60 and 80 g/kg (diet dry matter (DM) basis) of WF during the prepartum and postpartum periods, respectively; whole raw soybeans (WS, n=10), 120 and 160 g/kg (diet DM basis) of WS during the prepartum and postpartum periods, respectively; and calcium salts of unsaturated fatty acids (CSFA, n=11), 24 and 32 g/kg (diet DM basis) of CSFA during the prepartum and postpartum periods, respectively. Dry cows fed WF had higher DM and net  of lactation (NEL) intake than those fed WS or CSFA. The FA supplementation did not alter DM and NDF apparent total tract digestibility, dry cows fed WF exhibited greater NDF total tract digestion than cows fed WS or CSFA. Feeding WS instead of CSFA did not alter NEL intake and total tract digestion of nutrients, but increased milk fat yield and concentration. Calculated efficiency of milk yield was not altered by diets. FA supplementation increased EB during the postpartum period. Experimental diets increased long-chain FA (saturated and unsaturated FA) in milk. In addition, cows fed WS and CSFA had higher C18:1 trans-11 FA and C18:2 cis, and lower C18:3 FA in milk than those fed WF. Furthermore, cows fed CSFA had higher C18:1 trans-11 and cis-9, trans-11 FA than cows fed WS. Although supplemental C18:2 and C18:3 FA did not influence the milk yield of cows, they positively affected EB and increased unsaturated long-chain FA in milk fat.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26677076>The Lipoxygenases: Their Regulation and Implication in Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory processes and alterations of lipid metabolism play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders.

Among several isoforms, 5-LOX and 12/15-LOX are especially important in neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration. These two LOXs are regulated by substrate concentration and availability, and by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation through protein kinases PKA, PKC and MAP-kinases, including ERK1/ERK2 and p38. The protein/protein interaction also is involved in the mechanism of 5-LOX regulation through FLAP protein and coactosin-like protein. Moreover, non-heme iron and calcium ions are potent regulators of LOXs. The enzyme activity significantly depends on the cell redox state and is differently regulated by various signaling pathways. 5-LOX and 12/15-LOX convert , AA, and DHA into several bioactive compounds e.g. hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (5-HPETE, 12S-HPETE, 15S-HPETE), which are reduced to corresponding HETE compounds. These enzymes synthesize several bioactive lipids, e.g. leucotrienes, lipoxins, hepoxilins and docosahexaenoids. 15-LOX is responsible for DHA metabolism into neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) with significant antiapoptotic properties which is down-regulated in AD. In this review, the regulation and impact of 5-LOX and 12/15-LOX in the pathomechanism of AD is discussed. Moreover, we describe the role of several products of LOXs, which may have significant pro- or anti-inflammatory activity in AD, and the cytoprotective effects of LOX inhibitors.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24931531>Effect of supplementing essential fatty acids to pregnant nonlactating Holstein cows and their preweaned calves on calf performance, immune response, and health.</a></h2><p>The objective was to evaluate the effect of supplementing saturated or unsaturated fatty acids (FA) during late gestation of cows and during the preweaning period of calves on growth, health, and immune responses of calves. During the last 8wk of pregnancy, Holstein cattle (n=96) were fed no fat supplement (control), a saturated FA (SFA) supplement enriched in C18:0, or an unsaturated FA supplement enriched in the essential FA linoleic . Newborn calves were fed a milk replacer (MR) with either low linoleic  (LLA; coconut oil) or high linoleic  (HLA; coconut oil and porcine lard) concentration as the sole feedstuff during the first 30d. A grain mix with minimal linoleic  was offered between 31 and 60d of life. At 30 and 60d of life, concentrations of linoleic  in plasma were increased in calves born from dams supplemented with essential FA compared with SFA (44.0 vs. 42.5% of total FA) and in calves consuming HLA compared with LLA MR (46.3 vs. 40.8% of total FA). Total n-3 FA concentration was increased in plasma of calves fed HLA compared with LLA MR (1.44 vs. 1.32%) primarily due to increased α-. Prepartum supplementation with SFA tended to improve dry matter intake (48.8 vs. 46.7kg) and improved average daily gain (0.50 vs. 0.46kg/d) by calves without affecting efficiency of gain or circulating concentrations of anabolic metabolites or hormones. Increasing mean intake of linoleic  from approximately 4.6 to 11.0g/d during the first 60d of life increased average daily gain (0.50 vs. 0.45kg/d) without a change in dry matter intake, thus improving feed efficiency (0.63 vs. 0.59kg of gain/kg of dry matter intake).

To test the hypothesis that an n-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty -rich food could synergize with other, largely polyphenol-rich foods by producing greater reductions in metabolic disease conditions, the intake of English walnuts was evaluated in combination with 9 other whole foods.Eight-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice were fed low-fat (LF; 10% fat) and HF control diets, along with an HF diet with 8.6% (wt:wt) added walnuts for 9 wk. The HF control diet contained 46% fat with added sucrose (10.9%, wt:wt) and cholesterol (1%, wt:wt); the added sucrose and cholesterol were not present in the LF diet. Other groups were provided the walnut diet with a second whole food-raspberries, apples, cranberries, tart cherries, broccoli sprouts, olive oil, soy protein, or green tea. All of the energy-containing whole foods were added at an energy level equivalent to 1.5 servings/d. Body weights, food intake, and glucose tolerance were determined. Postmortem, serum lipids and inflammatory markers, hepatic fat, gene expression, and the relative concentrations of 594 biochemicals were measured.The addition of walnuts with either raspberries, apples, or green tea reduced glucose area under the curve compared with the HF diet alone (-93%, -64%, and -54%, respectively, P < 0.05). Compared with HF-fed mice, mice fed walnuts with either broccoli sprouts or green tea (-49% and -61%, respectively, P < 0.05) had reduced hepatic fat concentrations. There were differences in global gene expression patterns related to whole-food content, with many examples of differences in LF- and HF-fed mice, HF- and walnut-fed mice, and mice fed walnuts and walnuts plus other foods. The mean ± SEM increase in relative hepatic concentrations of the n-3 fatty acids α-, eicosapentanoic , and docosapentanoic  in all walnut-fed groups was 124% ± 13%, 159% ± 11%, and 114% ± 10%, respectively (P < 0.0001), compared with LF- and HF-fed mice not consuming walnuts.In obese male mice, walnut consumption with an HF Western-style diet caused changes in hepatic fat concentrations, gene expression patterns, and fatty  concentrations. The addition of a second whole food in combination with walnuts produced other changes in metabolite concentrations and gene expression patterns and other physiologic markers.

In this paper, we report the identification of all eight geometrical isomers of alpha-linolenic acid, one of the few essential omega-3 fatty acids that has attracted great attention, using low- electron ionization mass spectrometry. Three electron energies 70, 50, and 30 eV were studied and the mass spectrum of each isomer was obtained from the analysis of different concentrations of a standard mixture of alpha- geometrical isomers to ensure the robustness of the method. Principal component analysis was employed to model the complex variation of m/z intensities across the isomers. Only using the data of 30 eV  was complete differentiation among geometrical isomers observed. The unique cleavage pattern of the alpha- isomers leading to a benzenium ion structure is discussed and general fragmentation rules are derived using the mass spectra of over 300 compounds with different kinds and levels of unsaturation. Application of the proposed method is not limited to alpha-linolenic acid.

Freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of exogenous PGE1, PGE2 or PGE3. We found that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and to a lesser extent interleukin (IL)-10 production was inhibited by all PGE-subtypes in ConA-stimulated PBMC concomitant with unaffected IL-2 levels. The modulated cytokine production of ConA stimulated cells was independent of T-cell proliferation. PGE2 and PGE1 moderately stimulated proliferation, while PGE3 inhibited the proliferative response to some extent. In LPS-stimulated PBMC, TNF-alpha production was inhibited by all PGE-subtypes, whereas IL-6 remained unaffected and IL-10 production was increased. Time course experiments on the effects of PGE-subtypes on cytokine production after ConA or LPS stimulation showed these effects to be time dependent, but indifferent of the prostaglandin subtype added. Overall, the modulatory effects of PGE on cytokine production were irrespective of the subtype.

Metabolic complications in malaria are recognized contributors to severe and fatal malaria, but the impact of malaria infection on the production of small lipid derived signalling molecules is unknown. Knowledge of immunoregulatory patterns of these molecules in malaria is of great value for better understanding of the disease and improvement of treatment regimes, since the action of these classes of molecules is directly connected to the inflammatory response of the organism.Detection of oxylipins and endocannabinoids from plasma samples from forty children with uncomplicated and severe malaria as well as twenty controls was done after solid phase extraction followed by chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. The stable isotope dilution method was used for compound quantification. Data analysis was done with multivariate (principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and univariate approaches (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, t tests, correlation analysis).Forty different oxylipin and thirteen endocannabinoid metabolites were detected in the studied samples, with one oxylipin (thromboxane B2, TXB) in significantly lower levels and four endocannabinoids (OEA, PEA, DEA and EPEA) at significantly higher levels in infected individuals as compared to controls according to t test analysis with Bonferroni correction. Three oxylipins (13-HODE, 9-HODE and 13-oxo-ODE) were higher in severe compared to uncomplicated malaria cases according to the results from multivariate analysis.

However, fewer T cells co-cultured with these DCs proliferated (CellTrace Violet low) and expressed CD69 or CD25, while more were necrotic (7AAD+). We noted an increased proportion of T cells with a regulatory T cell (Treg) phenotype, i.e., when gating on CD4+ FoxP3+ CTLA-4+, CD4+ FoxP3+ Helios+ or CD4+ FoxP3+ PD-1+, in co-cultures with arachidonic - or DHA-primed DCs relative to control cultures. The proportion of putative Tregs was inversely correlated to T-cell proliferation, indicating a suppressive function of these cells. With arachidonic  DCs produced higher levels of prostaglandin E2 while T cells produced lower amounts of IL-10 and IFNγ. In conclusion arachidonic  and DHA induced up-regulation of activation markers on DCs. However arachidonic - and DHA-primed DCs reduced T-cell proliferation and increased the proportion of T cells expressing FoxP3, indicating that these fatty acids can promote induction of regulatory T cells.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21599946>The impact of FADS genetic variants on ω6 polyunsaturated fatty  metabolism in African Americans.</a></h2><p>Arachidonic  (AA) is a long-chain omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) synthesized from the precursor dihomo-gamma- (DGLA) that plays a vital role in  and inflammation. Variants in the Fatty  Desaturase (FADS) family of genes on chromosome 11q have been shown to play a role in PUFA metabolism in populations of European and Asian ancestry; no work has been done in populations of African ancestry to date.In this study, we report that African Americans have significantly higher circulating levels of plasma AA (p = 1.35 × 10(-48)) and lower DGLA levels (p = 9.80 × 10(-11)) than European Americans. Tests for association in N = 329 individuals across 80 nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Fatty  Desaturase (FADS) locus revealed significant association with AA, DGLA and the AA/DGLA ratio, a measure of enzymatic efficiency, in both racial groups (peak signal p = 2.85 × 10(-16) in African Americans, 2.68 × 10(-23) in European Americans). Ancestry-related differences were observed at an upstream marker previously associated with AA levels (rs174537), wherein, 79-82% of African Americans carry two copies of the G allele compared to only 42-45% of European Americans. Importantly, the allelic effect of the G allele, which is associated with enhanced conversion of DGLA to AA, on enzymatic efficiency was similar in both groups.We conclude that the impact of FADS genetic variants on PUFA metabolism, specifically AA levels, is likely more pronounced in African Americans due to the larger proportion of individuals carrying the genotype associated with increased FADS1 enzymatic conversion of DGLA to AA.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9514943>Regulation of  permeability and occludin expression by polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p> (TJ) are the topical most structure in epithelial and endothelial cells and play a key role in the control of permeability and prevention of tumour cell invasion of endothelium.

We identified twenty-two articles from fourteen RCT. Most studies were conducted in adults. These used between 80 and 2000 mg ARA per d and were of 1-12 weeks duration. Supplementation with ARA doses as low as 80 mg/d increased the content of ARA in different blood fractions. Overall there seem to be few marked benefits for adults of increasing ARA intake from the typical usual intake of 100-200 mg/d to as much as 1000 mg/d; the few studies using higher doses (1500 or 2000 mg/d) also report little benefit. However, there may be an impact of ARA on cognitive and muscle function which could be particularly relevant in the ageing population. The studies reviewed here suggest no adverse effects in adults of increased ARA intake up to at least 1000-1500 mg/d on blood lipids, platelet aggregation and blood clotting, immune function,  or urinary excretion of ARA metabolites.

Therefore, we investigated the independent and combined effects of α- (ALA) supplementation and exercise training on whole-body glucose homeostasis and mitochondrial bioenergetics within the WAT and skeletal muscle of obese Zucker rats.We randomly assigned obese Zucker rats to receive a control diet alone or supplemented with ALA and to remain sedentary or undergo exercise training for 4 weeks (CON-Sed, ALA-Sed, CON-Ex and ALA-Ex groups). Whole-body glucose tolerance was determined in response to a glucose load. Mitochondrial content and bioenergetics were examined in skeletal muscle and epididymal WAT (eWAT). Insulin sensitivity and cellular stress were assessed by western blot.Exercise training independently improved whole-body glucose tolerance as well as insulin-induced signalling in muscle and WAT. However, the consumption of ALA during exercise training prevented exercise-mediated improvements in whole-body glucose tolerance. ALA consumption did not influence exercise-induced adaptations within skeletal muscle, insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial bioenergetics. In contrast, within eWAT, ALA supplementation attenuated insulin signalling, decreased mitochondrial respiration and increased the fraction of electron leak to reactive oxygen species (ROS).These findings indicate that, in an obese rodent model, consumption of ALA attenuates the favourable adaptive changes of exercise training within eWAT, which consequently impacts whole-body glucose homeostasis. The direct translation to humans, however, remains to be determined.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'insulin resistance', 'mitochondria', 'obesity', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28403631>Identification and evaluation of antibacterial agents present in lipophilic fractions isolated from sub-products of Phoenix dactilyfera.</a></h2><p>In this study, the dried powder of seeds and pollen of Phoenix dactylifera was extracted using Soxhlet extractor and biochemical composition of lipophilic extracts was analysed by GCMS.

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were activated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and cultured in media supplemented with different fatty acids (18:0, 18:1(n - 9), 18:2(n - 6), 18:3(n - 3) and 20:4(n - 6)) at a final concentration of 30 microM. All the fatty acids added were elongated by activated PBMC and the maximal activity was observed on 20:4(n - 6) (a 25% of conversion to 22:4(n - 6)). Supplementation with stearic  increased the proportion of oleic (from 21.4% to 23.7%) and eicosaenoic (from 3.1% to 5.7%) acids in cellular lipids, indicating the existence of a delta 9-desaturase activity. Supplementation with linoleic and linoleic acids increased slightly the cell content in their more unsaturated derivatives. Direct measurement of desaturase activities was performed by incubating quiescent and activated PBMC with [1-14C]stearic, [1-14C]linoleic and [1-14C] acids. Quiescent cells exhibited a very low delta 9-desaturase and no sign of delta 6-desaturase activity. A moderate and progressive activation of delta 9-, delta 6- and delta 5-desaturases was observed during blastic transformation of human PBMC. Up to 8% of 18:0 was converted to monoenes, 4% and 1.5% of 18:2(n - 6) was converted to trienes and tetraenes, respectively, and 14.5% of 18:3(n - 3) was converted to pentaenes. The maximal relative activities were found after 48 h of PHA-stimulation for delta 9-desaturase (around 90 pmol of 18:0 converted per 10(6) cells in the last 24 h) and at 72 h for delta 6- and delta 5-desaturases (around 75 and 140 pmol of 18:2 and 18:3, respectively, converted per 10(7) cells in the last 24 h).

The search for sustainable disease control measure is of extreme importance, thus becoming imperative to fully characterize the mechanisms leading to an incompatible interaction. We have previously shown that  signalling events play an important role in grapevine's response to this pathogen, namely through changes in  content,  peroxidation and jasmonic  synthesis. Here, we have characterized the modulation of  in leaves from two V. vinifera cultivars (resistant and susceptible to P. viticola) in the first hours after pathogen inoculation. Prior to pathogen inoculation both genotypes present an inherently different fatty  composition that is highly modulated in the resistant genotype after pathogen challenge. Such changes involve modulation of phospholipase A activity suggesting that the source of lipids mobilized upon pathogen infection are the chloroplast membranes. This work thus provides original evidence on the involvement of  signalling and phospholipases in grapevine immune responses to pathogen infection.

Hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity and total BA in serum, liver, and feces were assessed. The dyslipidemic HF group had: (1) increased intestinal BA uptake and Asbt and Osta/b mRNA expression, (2) increased BA in serum, (3) decreased hepatic expression of Ntcp, Bsep, and Cyp7a1 mRNA, (4) increased activity of HMG-CoA reductase, (5) increased hepatic expression of Fxr and Shp mRNA, (6) decreased hepatic expression of Lrh-1 and Hnf4a mRNA, and (7) decreased BA in feces, when compared to control, HF + CNO, and HF + FO groups. Immunostaining revealed increased expression of intestinal Asbt and hepatic Ntcp protein in the HF group when compared to control, HF + CNO, and HF + FO groups. n-3 FA abrogated dyslipidemia-induced changes in the intestinal uptake, hepatic synthesis, and enterohepatic transporters of BA in both young and aged rats.

Expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS-2) was evaluated by real-time PCR.All cytokine combinations had an inducible effect on nitrite secretion in HCF, PBMC and co-cultured PBMC and HCF, but not in HCE cells. Treatment with a combination of IL-6, LPS, TNF-α, IFN- γ and IL-1β induced the highest nitrite secretion (2.91 fold, P < 0.01) as compared to cells incubated in medium alone. nitrite secretion was reduced by 38.9 % (P < 0.05) after treatment with ALA alone.

Visceral adiposity is part of the metabolic syndrome, together with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension and inflammation. Alleviation of metabolic syndrome requires normalization of insulin release and responses. This review assesses our current knowledge of the mechanisms that allow n-3 PUFAs to improve insulin secretion and sensitivity. EPA has been more extensively studied than either ALA or DHA. The complex actions of EPA include increased G-protein-receptor-mediated release of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) from enteroendocrine L-cells in the intestine, up-regulation of the apelin pathway and down-regulation of other control pathways to promote insulin secretion by the pancreatic β-cells, together with suppression of inflammatory responses to adipokines, inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α actions and prevention of decreased insulin-like growth factor-1 secretion to improve peripheral insulin responses. The receptors involved and the mechanisms of action probably differ for ALA and DHA, with antiobesity effects predominating for ALA and anti-inflammatory effects for DHA. Modifying both GLP-1 release and the actions of adipokines by n-3 PUFAs could lead to additive improvements in both insulin secretion and sensitivity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Treatment of the CTL cells with any of the physiologically important FFA; oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2),  (18:3), or arachidonic (20:4) , at concentrations between 1 and 10 microM inhibits the target cell-mediated rise in [Ca2+]i which occurs within seconds of stimulation and the release of BLT-esterase, which occurs over a period of 1 to 3 h. These inhibitory effects are observed within seconds to minutes of FFA addition. Inhibition can be reversed by treating cells with fatty  free BSA and, in agreement with our previous studies, indicates that the effects of FFA are due to physical perturbations of cellular components.

Cis unsaturated FFA were found to disorder the lipid acyl chains and the degree of disorder was found to increase with the degree of cis unsaturation. These results, together with the previous studies, suggest that inhibition results from a physical perturbation of plasma membrane lipid order.

This study aims to evaluate whether the conversion of PUFA by carp induces a sufficient biosynthesis of LC-PUFA to maintain a good immunocompetence status in this species. Six iso-nitrogenous (crude protein = 39.1%) and iso-lipidic (crude lipids = 10%) diets containing three different  sources (cod liver oil (CLO) as fish oil; linseed oil (LO) and sunflower oil (SFO) as plant oils) were formulated with or without β-glucan supplementation at 0.25 g/kg diet. Juvenile carp (16.3 ± 0.6 g initial body weight) were fed a daily ration of 4% body weight for 9 weeks and then infected at day 64 with the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophyla. No significant differences in survival rate, final body weight, specific growth rate and feed conversion rate were observed between diets. After bacterial infection, mortality rate did not differ between fish fed CLO and plant oil-based diets, indicating that the latter oils did not affect the overall immunocompetence status of common carp. Plant oil-based diets did not alter lysozyme activity in healthy and infected fish. No negative effects of plant oils on complement activity (ACH50) were observed in healthy fish, even if both plant oil-based diets induced a decrease in stimulated fish two days after infection. Furthermore, the levels of various immune genes (nk, lys, il-8, pla, pge, alox) were not affected by plant oil-based diets. The expression of pla and pge genes were higher in SFO-fed fish than in CLO ones, indicating that this plant oil rich in linoleic  (LA) better stimulated the eicosanoid  process than fish oil. In response to β-glucan supplementation, some innate immune functions seemed differentially affected by plant oil-based diets. LO and SFO induced substantial LC-PUFA production, even if fish fed CLO displayed the highest EPA and DHA levels in tissues. SFO rich in LA induced the highest ARA levels in fish muscle while LO rich in α- (ALA) sustained higher EPA production than SFO. A significantly higher fads-6a expression level was observed in SFO fish than in LO ones, but this was not observed for elovl5 expression. In conclusion, the results show that common carp fed plant oil-based diets are able to produce substantial amounts of LC-PUFA for sustaining growth rate, immune status and disease resistance similar to fish fed a fish oil-based diet. The differences in the production capacity of LC-PUFAs by the two plant oil-based diets were associated to a differential activation of some immune pathways, explaining how the use of these oils did not affect the overall immunocompetence of fish challenged with bacterial infection. Moreover, plant oil-based diets did not induce substantial negative effects on the immunomodulatory action of β-glucans, confirming that these oils are suitable for sustaining a good immunocompetence status in common carp.Copyright © 2019.

Inflammation associated with IR is an interesting area of biomedical research in recent years and is expected to affect insulin signalling pathway via downregulating glucose transporters. In the present study, we evaluate the potential of punicic  (PA), a nutraceutical found in pomegranate seed oil, against TNF-α induced alteration in 3T3-L1 adipocytes on glucose metabolism, endocrine function and inflammation. IR was induced in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by treating with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) and various concentrations of PA (5, 10, 30 μM) were incubated simultaneously. After 24 h, we found that TNF-α treatment increased mRNA expression of SOCS3, PTP1B and a decrease in IRS1 causing diminished glucose uptake. Further, it showed significantly increased transcriptional activity of NFκB and leptin secretion while PA maintained leptin levels normal. Additionally, PA prevented the over-expression of phosphorylated JNK in a dose dependent manner during IR. PA also ameliorated significantly the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. From the results, we conclude that PA is effective to ameliorate TNF-α induced IR and also we recommend the intake of PA for control and management of IR and its associated complications.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

In addition, we compared the effect of an injection of SFE with that of OA, soybean oil (a source of SFE), emulsified OA and C-18 fatty acids. Bolus injection of SFE (0.3-4.8 ml/kg) had little effect on Pao2) and pulmonary vascular permeability. Injection of an equivalent amount of OA, on the other hand, significantly decreased Pao2 and increased pulmonary vascular hyper-permeability. This decrease in Pao2 was attenuated by emulsification. Unemulsified soybean oil also induced a decrease in Pao2, although the effect was weaker than that of OA. Other unsaturated C-18 fatty acids (linoleic and ) induced a decrease in Pao2 as potent as OA while stearic , a C-18 saturated fatty , had little effect. Although we did not observe pulmonary toxicity as a result of "bolus injection" of SFE, the chemical form, for example, emulsification and the degree of saturability of the carbon chain, seems to influence the pulmonary toxicities of lipids and fatty acids.

After a 6-month dietary intervention, there were significant decreases in the serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), TNF-α, IL-6, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble endothelial selectin (sE-selectin) and asymmetric dimethylarginine in both dietary groups. However, no inter-group differences were observed for all these changes.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) plays an important role in the development hepatic fibrosis. The overexpression of PAI-1 induces ECM accumulation, the main hallmark of chronic liver diseases. Death of hepatocytes is a characteristic feature of chronic liver disease due to various causes. The TGF-β1-mediated apoptotic pathway is regarded as a promising therapeutic target in hepatic fibrosis. Gamma- (GLA) is of special interest as it possesses anti-fibrosis, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties. However, the precise mechanism for GLA in chronic liver disease is not still clear. The aim of the present study was to determine whether GLA prevents hepatic PAI-1 expression and apoptosis through the inhibition of TGF-β1-mediated molecular mediators. GLA attenuated TGF-β1-stimulated PAI-1 expression, and inhibited PAI-1 promoter activity in AML12 cells. This effect was mediated by Smad3/4, the p38 pathways. We also found that GLA suppressed TGF-β1-induced apoptotic activation of the Bcl-2 family and caspase family of proteins, which resulted in the inhibition of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 cleavage.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the induction of LOX pathway in tobacco and potato cells induced by a concentrated culture filtrate (CCF) from Phytophthora infestans and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Pectobacterium atrosepticum. Oxylipin activation was evaluated by the measurement of LOX activity and metabolite quantification. The basal levels of oxylipins and fatty acids showed that potato cells contained higher amounts of linoleic (LA),  (LnA) and stearic acids than tobacco cells. The major oxylipin in potato cells, 9(S),10(S),11(R)-trihydroxy-12(Z),15(Z)-octadecadienoic  (9,10,11-THOD), was not detected in tobacco cells. CCF induced a sharp increase of LA and LnA at 8 h in tobacco cells. In contrast they decreased in potato cells. In CCF-treated tobacco cells, colneleic  increased up to 24 h, colnelenic  and 9(S)-hydroxyoctadecatrienoic  (9(S)-HOT) increased up to 16 h. In potato cells, only colneleic  increased slightly until 16 h. A differential induction of LOX activity was measured in both cells treated by CCF. With LPS treatment, only 9,10,11-THOD accumulation was significantly induced at 16 h in potato cells. Fatty acids were constant in tobacco but decreased in potato cells over the studied time period. These results showed that the two elicitors were differently perceived by the two Solanaceae and that oxylipin pathway is strongly induced in tobacco with the CCF.

Aβ induces neurotoxicity and releases inflammatory mediators or cytokines through activation of glial cell, and these pathological features are observed in AD patient's brain. The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effect of  (ALA) on Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in C6 glial cells. Exposure of C6 glial cells to 50 μM Aβ caused cell death, overproduction of nitric oxide (NO), and pro-inflammatory cytokines release [interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α], while treatment of ALA increased cell viability and markedly attenuated Aβ-induced excessive production of NO and those inflammatory cytokines. Inhibitory effect of ALA on generation of NO and cytokines was mediated by down-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein and mRNA expressions. In addition, ALA treatment inhibited reactive  species generation induced by Aβ through the enhancement of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) protein levels and subsequent induction of heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in C6 glial cells dose- and time-dependently. Furthermore, the levels of neprilysin and insulin-degrading enzyme protein expressions, which contribute to degradation of Aβ, were also increased by treatment of ALA compared to Aβ-treated control group. In conclusion, effects of ALA on Aβ degradation were shown to be mediated through inhibition of inflammatory responses and activation of antioxidative system, Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling pathway, in C6 glial cells. Our findings suggest that ALA might have the potential for therapeutics of AD.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25755223>Polyunsaturated fatty  regulation of adipocyte FADS1 and FADS2 expression and function.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) regulate fatty  desaturase (FADS1, FADS2) expression in the liver; however, it is unknown whether PUFAs regulate FADS in adipocytes. This is important to study considering reports that link altered desaturase activity with adipose tissue PUFA profiles, body weight, and whole-body glucose homeostasis. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the direct effects of PUFAs on FADS expression in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with either α- (ALA), linoleic (LA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), or arachidonic  (AA). Gene expression, protein abundance, and cellular PUFA content were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, and gas chromatography, respectively.Fads1 and Fads2 gene expression was reduced by EPA and AA, but not ALA or LA. Reductions in gene expression were reflected in FADS2 protein levels, but not FADS1. Treating cells with ALA and LA led to significant increases in the cellular content of downstream PUFAs. Neither ALA nor EPA changed docosahexaenoic  content.Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes have a functional FADS pathway that can be regulated by PUFA. Therefore, this common adipocyte model is suitable to study dietary regulation of the FADS pathway.© 2015 The  Society.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28599651>Microtiter plate cultivation of oleaginous fungi and monitoring of lipogenesis by high-throughput FTIR spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Oleaginous fungi can accumulate lipids by utilizing a wide range of waste substrates. They are an important source for the industrial production of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (gamma- and arachidonic ) and have been suggested as an alternative route for biodiesel production. Initial research steps for various applications include the screening of fungi in order to find efficient fungal producers with desired fatty  composition. Traditional cultivation methods (shake flask) and lipid analysis (extraction-gas chromatography) are not applicable for large-scale screening due to their low throughput and time-consuming analysis. Here we present a microcultivation system combined with high-throughput Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for efficient screening of oleaginous fungi.The microcultivation system enables highly reproducible fungal fermentations throughout 12 days of cultivation. Reproducibility was validated by FTIR and HPLC data. Analysis of FTIR spectral ester carbonyl peaks of fungal biomass offered a reliable high-throughput at-line method to monitor lipid accumulation. Partial least square regression between gas chromatography fatty  data and corresponding FTIR spectral data was used to set up calibration models for the prediction of saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, unsaturation index, total lipid content and main individual fatty acids. High coefficients of determination (R = 0.86-0.96) and satisfactory residual predictive deviation of cross-validation (RPD = 2.6-5.1) values demonstrated the goodness of these models.We have demonstrated in this study, that the presented microcultivation system combined with rapid, high-throughput FTIR spectroscopy is a suitable screening platform for oleaginous fungi. Sample preparation for FTIR measurements can be automated to further increase throughput of the system.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202985>Dihomo-γ- inhibits several key cellular processes associated with atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis and its complications are responsible for one in three global deaths. Nutraceuticals show promise in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis but require an indepth understanding of the mechanisms underlying their actions. A previous study showed that the omega-6 fatty , dihomo-γ- (DGLA), attenuated atherosclerosis in the apolipoprotein E deficient mouse model system. However, the mechanisms underlying such protective effects of DGLA are poorly understood and were therefore investigated. We show that DGLA attenuates chemokine-driven monocytic migration together with foam cell formation and the expression of key pro-atherogenic genes induced by three pro-inflammatory cytokines in human macrophages. The effect of DGLA on interferon-γ signaling was mediated via inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 phosphorylation on serine 727. In relation to anti-foam cell action, DGLA inhibits modified LDL uptake by both macropinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis, the latter by reduction in expression of two key scavenger receptors (SR-A and CD36), and stimulates cholesterol efflux from foam cells. DGLA also improves macrophage mitochondrial bioenergetic profile by decreasing proton leak. Gamma- and prostaglandin E1, upstream precursor and key metabolite respectively of DGLA, also acted in an anti-atherogenic manner. The actions of DGLA extended to other key atherosclerosis-associated cell types with attenuation of endothelial cell proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells in response to platelet-derived growth factor. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-atherogenic actions of DGLA and supports further assessments on its protective effects on plaque regression in vivo and in human trials.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

A eukaryotic microalga (Scenedesmus obliquus (M2-1)) and a prokaryotic one (Gloeothece sp.) were used as case studies. Concerning total antioxidant capacity, the hexane:isopropanol (3:2) and acetone extracts of Sc. obliquus (M2-1) were the most effective against DPPH(•) and ABTS(+•), respectively. Gloeothece sp. ethanol extracts were the most interesting scavengers of O₂(•)⁻, probably due the high content of . On the other hand, acetone and hexane:isopropanol (3:2) extracts were the most interesting ones in (•)NO⁻ assay. Acetone extract exhibited the best results for the ABTS assay, likely associated to its content of carotenoids, in both microalgae. Otherwise, ethanol stood out in PUFA extraction. Therefore, profiles of lipidic components extracted are critical for evaluating the antioxidant performance-which appears to hinge, in particular, on the balance between carotenoids and PUFAs.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28536059>Current state of knowledge on the traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacology of the genus Hymenaea.</a></h2><p>Plants of the genus Hymenaea (Fabaceae) are used in South American and Asian traditional medicines to treat a multitude of disorders, like cough, diarrhea, dysentery, intestinal colic, pulmonary weakness, asthma, anemia, sore throat, and for the treatment of kidney problems, viral related disorders, chronic cystitis, bronchitis, and bladder infections.

Herein, we investigated effects of β-eleostearic  on T24 human bladder cancer cells. In this study, results showed that β-eleostearic  had strong cytotoxicity to induce cell apoptosis, which was mediated by reactive  species (ROS) in T24 cells. The cell viability assay results showed that incubation with β-eleostearic  concentrations of 10-80μmol/L caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease of T24 cell viability, and the IC(50) value was 21.2μmol/L at 24h and 13.1μmol/L at 48h. Annexin V/PI double staining was used to assess apoptosis with flow cytometry. Treatment with β-eleostearic  caused massive ROS accumulation and GSH decrease, which lead to activation of caspase-3 and down-regulation of Bcl-2 indicating induction of apoptosis. Subsequently, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and PEG-catalase effectively blocked the ROS elevated effect of β-eleostearic , which suggested that β-eleostearic -induced apoptosis involved ROS generated.

Recently, we found that reactive  species mediate inflammatory cytokine expression and apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cells stimulated with cerulein. Omega-3 fatty acids show antioxidant action in various cells and tissues. In the present study, we investigated whether omega-3 fatty acids inhibit cytokine expression in cerulein-stimulated pancreatic acinar cells and whether omega-3 fatty acids suppress apoptotic cell death in pancreatic acinar cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. We found that omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and  (ALA), suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6) and inhibited the activation of transcription factor activator protein-1 in cerulein-stimulated pancreatic acinar cells. DHA and ALA inhibited DNA fragmentation, inhibited the decrease in cell viability, and inhibited the expression of apoptotic genes (p53, Bax, apoptosis-inducing factor) induced by hydrogen peroxide in pancreatic acinar cells.

Using lucigenin-amplified chemiluminescence, a dose-dependent increase in extracellular superoxide levels was observed during the treatment of fibroblasts with oleic, linoleic and γ- acids. ROS production was dependent on the addition of β-NADH or NADPH to the medium. Diphenyleneiodonium inhibited the effect of oleic, linoleic and γ- acids on fibroblast superoxide release by 79%, 92% and 82%, respectively. Increased levels of p47 (phox) phosphorylation due to fatty  treatment were detected by Western blotting analyses of fibroblast proteins. Increased p47 (phox) mRNA expression was observed using real-time PCR. The rank order for the fatty  stimulation of the fibroblast oxidative burst was as follows: γ- > linoleic > oleic.

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and summarize published articles on the association between fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs with the risk of IBD.PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used to conduct a comprehensive search and identify eligible literature published prior to January 2019. Fixed-effects model or random-effects models (DerSimonian-Laird method) were applied to pool the effect sizes. Cochrane Q test was used to trace the potential source of heterogeneity across studies.12 studies (5 prospective and 7 case-control) were included in the systematic review, which ten of them were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Studies were included a total sample size of 282610 participants which 2002 of them were cases of IBD [1061 Crohn's disease (CD) and 937 ulcerative  (UC)]. A negative association was found between fish consumption and the incidence of CD (pooled effect size: 0.54, 95%CI: 0.31-0.96, P = 0.03). There was no relationship between total dietary n-3 PUFAs intake and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95%CI: 0.80-1.72, P = 0.41).

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the acute and short-term effects of walnut intake on changes in microvascular function and the relationship of these effects to plasma epoxides, the cytochrome-P450-derived metabolites of fatty acids. Thirty-eight hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women were randomized to 4 weeks of 5 g or 40 g of daily walnut intake. All outcomes were measured after an overnight fast and 4 h after walnut intake. Microvascular function, assessed as the reactive hyperemia index (RHI), was the primary outcome measure, with serum lipids and plasma epoxides as secondary measures. Compared to 5 g of daily walnut intake, consuming 40 g/d of walnuts for 4 weeks increased the RHI and Framingham RHI. Total cholesterol and low- and high-density cholesterol did not significantly change after walnut intake. The change in RHI after 4 weeks of walnut intake was associated with the change in the sum of plasma epoxides (r=0.65, P=.002) but not with the change in the sum of plasma hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids. Of the individual plasma epoxides, arachidonic--derived 14(15)-epoxyeicosatrienoic  was most strongly associated with the change in microvascular function (r=0.72, P<.001). These data support the concept that the intake of walnut-derived fatty acids can favorably affect plasma epoxide production, resulting in improved microvascular function.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Integrated Analysis of Transcriptomics and Metabolomics in Blunt Snout Bream (Megalobrama amblycephala).</a></h2><p>Fish is a protein-rich food and is increasingly favored by consumers. It has been well recognized that the flesh composition of fish is closely related to its maturation and growth stage, but few studies have explored these differences. Additionally, hormone residues in fish after artificial induction of reproduction also attract consumer concern. In this study, we attempt to address these concerns by using a combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses to identify key regulated pathways, genes, and metabolites that may affect the flesh nutrition of one typical aquaculture species in China, blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala).The four groups of fish were used for transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses, including one-year-old immature (group I), two-year-old immature (group II), two-year-old mature (group III) and successfully spawned (group IV) female M. amblycephala after artificial induction of reproduction.We identified a total of 1460 differential compounds and 1107 differentially expressed unigenes in muscle among the different groups. Differential metabolites related to fish age (group II vs group I, group III vs group I) were largely enriched in "Glycerophospholipid ", "Linoleic  ", "α- ", and "Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids". Between these two pairwise comparisons, metabolites that are beneficial to human health, such as docosapentaenoic , α-, eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic  were found to be significantly decreased in two-year-old (group II, group III) compared with one-year-old (group I) M. amblycephala. Only one differential metabolite related to fish maturation, a triglyceride, was detected between groups III and II. Transcriptomics data showed that differently expressed genes (between group III vs group II, group III vs group I) related to maturation were highly enriched in "Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)", "Sphingolipid " and "Phagosome". DEGs (between group II vs group I, group III vs group I) relating to fish age were enriched in the "cGMP-PKG signaling pathway", "FoxO signaling pathway", and "AMPK signaling pathway". The gene-metabolite interaction network showed pivotal genes, including fumarate hydratase and GNPAT, which played a major role in the regulation of glycerphospholipid . The nutritional components were also measured, which verified the metabolomics results. Moreover, the metabolomics results showed that after 24 hours of artificial hormone injection, the drug was completely metabolized.Integrated analysis demonstrated that the nutrition value of fish fillet was much more related to fish age compared with maturation status in M. amblycephala females.© 2018 The Author(s).

Endotoxins are now well recognized as an important factor implicated in the onset and maintain of this inflammatory state during fat digestion in high-fat diet. As a preventive strategy, lipid formulation could be optimized to limit these phenomena, notably regarding fatty  profile and PL emulsifier content. Little is known about soybean polar lipid (SPL) consumption associated to oils rich in saturated FA vs. anti-inflammatory omega-3 FA such as α- on inflammation and metabolic endotoxemia. We then investigated in mice the effect of different synthetic diets enriched with two different oils, palm oil or flaxseed oil and containing or devoid of SPL on adipose tissue inflammation and endotoxin receptors. In both groups containing SPL, adipose tissue (WAT) increased compared with groups devoid of SPL and an induction of MCP-1 and LBP was observed in WAT. However, only the high-fat diet in which flaxseed oil was associated with SPL resulted in both higher WAT inflammation and higher circulating sCD14 in plasma. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that LPS transporters LBP and sCD14 and adipose tissue inflammation can be modulated by SPL in high fat diets differing in oil composition. Notably high-flaxseed oil diet exerts a beneficial metabolic impact, however blunted by PL addition. Our study suggests that nutritional strategies can be envisaged by optimizing dietary lipid sources in manufactured products, including fats/oils and polar lipid emulsifiers, in order to limit the inflammatory impact of palatable foods.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Mitochondrial changes in CL were measured through mass spectrometry.Our data indicated that OA(18:1) was the most efficient fatty  that incorporated into CL, forming symmetrical CL without fatty  elongation and desaturation. In addition, LA(18:2) and ALA(18:3) were further elongated before incorporation, significantly increasing the number of double bonds and the chain length of CL. GLA and SDA were not optimal substrates for remodeling enzymes. The findings of RT-qPCR experiments revealed that none of these changes in CL occurred through the regulation of CL remodeling- or synthesis-related genes. The fatty  desaturase and transportation genes-Fads2 and Cpt1a, respectively-were differentially regulated by the supplementation of five unsaturated 18-carbon fatty acids.The process of fatty  incorporation to CL was regulated by the fatty  desaturation and transportation into  in macrophage.

Intact OA(18:1) was incorporated to CL; LA(18:2) and ALA(18:3) were desaturated and elongated to long chain fatty  before the incorporation; GLA(18:3) and SDA(18:4) were unfavorable for the CL incorporation.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21830145>Identification of metabolites related to mechanisms of resistance in barley against Fusarium graminearum, based on mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Fusarium head blight (FHB) is an economically important disease of the family Triticeae, as, apart from yield reduction it also causes quality deterioration by producing mycotoxins. Host resistance is the most promising way to control the disease. Metabolic profiling was applied to identify resistance related (RR) metabolites against Fusarium graminearum in five FHB-resistant genotypes ('Chevron', 'H5277-44', 'H5277-164', 'M92-513' and 'M122') relative to one FHB-susceptible genotype ('Stander'). The disease severity was assessed in greenhouse to group the genotypes based on FHB-resistance. The disease was quantified as the proportion of diseased spikelets (PSD) and the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). Spikelets were collected at 72 h post inoculation. Metabolites were extracted into an aqueous solution of methanol and analyzed using a LC-hybrid-MS system. Metabolite abundances were subjected to a resistant versus susceptible pair-wise analysis, using a t test. Resistance related (RR) metabolites, both constitutive (RRC) and induced (RRI), were identified amongst metabolites whose levels were significantly higher in resistant genotype than in susceptible. Among 1,430 RR metabolites, 115 were putatively identified. These RR metabolites belonged to different chemical groups: fatty acids: ; phenylpropanoids: p-coumaric, sinapic ; flavonoids: naringenin, kaempferol glucoside, catechol glucoside. In addition, resistance indicator metabolites, such as deoxynivalenol (DON) and DON-3-O-glucoside (D3G) were also detected. The amount of total DON synthesized converted to D3G (PDC) was the greatest in resistant genotype 'Chevron' (PDC = 0.76).

It may proceed either via the direct action of a triacylglycerol lipase, or in certain plant species via a specific lipid body 13-lipoxygenase. For the involvement of a lipoxygenase previous results suggested that the hydroxy- or oxo-group that is being introduced into the fatty  backbone by this lipoxygenase forms a barrier to continuous β-oxidation.This study shows however that a complete degradation of oxygenated fatty acids is possible by isolated cucumber and sunflower glyoxysomes. Interestingly, degradation is accompanied by the formation of saturated short chain acyl-CoAs with chain length between 4 and 12 carbon atoms lacking the hydroxy- or oxo-diene system of the oxygenated fatty  substrate. The presence of these CoA esters suggests the involvement of a specific reduction of the diene system at a chain length of 12 carbon atoms including conversion of the hydroxy-group at C7.To our knowledge this metabolic pathway has not been described for the degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids so far.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate, whether this combined effect of As2O3 and DHA is also applicable to other PUFAs [i.e., eicospentaenoic  (EPA), arachidonic  (AA), and gamma- (GLA)]. Fourteen tumor cell lines were incubated with As2O3 (1 microM), PUFA (25-100 microM), or the combination thereof (+/- vitamin E). Cell viability (colorimetric), apoptosis (bivariate annexin V/propidium iodide staining, detection of hypodiploid DNA), and thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) were evaluated. Twelve of 14 As2O3-resistant cell lines tested were resistant to PUFA monotherapy. However, combined treatment with As2O3 and either PUFA significantly reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner with AA being the most potent As2O3 enhancer. The combined cytotoxic effect of As2O3/AA treatment was due to induction of apoptosis, preceded by increased intracellular TBARS and was abolished by the antioxidant vitamin E. Importantly, the combined effect of As2O3 and AA was selectively toxic for malignant cells because no cytotoxic effect was observed in normal skin fibroblasts and human microvascular endothelial cells. In conclusion, our study shows that also other PUFAs than DHA-and in particular the omega-6-PUFA AA--can be used as effective modulators of tumor cell chemosensitivity to clinically achievable concentrations of As2O3.

Because adipocyte quantity is established between late childhood and early adolescence, understanding the impact of PUFAs on weight gain during the school-age years is crucial to developing effective interventions.We quantified N-3 and N-6 PUFAs in serum samples of 668 Colombian schoolchildren aged 5-12 years at the time of recruitment into a cohort study, using gas-liquid chromatography. Serum concentrations of N-3 ( (ALA), eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic ) and N-6 PUFAs (linoleic , gamma-, dihomo-gamma-, arachidonic ) were determined as percentage total fatty acids. Children's anthropometry was measured annually for a median of 30 months. We used mixed-effects models with restricted cubic splines to construct population body mass index-for-age z-score (BAZ) growth curves for age- and sex-specific quartiles of each PUFA.N-3 ALA was inversely related to BAZ gain after adjustment for sex, baseline age and weight status, as well as household socioeconomic level. Estimated BAZ change between 6 and 14 years among children in the highest quartile of ALA compared with those in the lowest quartile was 0.45 (95% confidence interval: 0.07, 0.83) lower (P-trend=0.006).N-3 ALA may be protective against weight gain in school-age children.

However, common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), which is the ancestor of Asian cultivated rice (O. sativa), has significant potential as a genetic source of resistance to M. oryzae. Recent studies have shown that the domestication of rice has altered its relationship to symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizae. A comparative response of wild and domestic rice inhabited by mycorrhizae to infection by M. oryzae has not been documented.In the current study, roots of wild and cultivated rice colonized with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus (AMF) Rhizoglomus intraradices were used to compare the transcriptomic responses of the two species to infection by M. oryzae. Phenotypic analysis indicated that the  of wild and cultivated rice with R. intraradices improved the resistance of both genotypes to M. oryzae. Wild AM rice, however, was more resistant to M. oryzae than the cultivated AM rice, as well as nonmycorrhizal roots of wild rice. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the mechanisms regulating the responses of wild and cultivated AM rice to M. oryzae invasion were significantly different. The expression of a greater number of genes was changed in wild AM rice than in cultivated AM rice in response to the pathogen. Both wild and cultivated AM rice exhibited a shared response to M. oryzae which included genes related to the auxin and salicylic  pathways; all of these play important roles in pathogenesis-related protein synthesis. In wild AM rice, secondary metabolic and biotic stress-related analyses indicated that the jasmonic  synthesis-related α- pathway, the phenolic and terpenoid pathways, as well as the phenolic and terpenoid syntheses-related mevalonate (MVA) pathway were more affected by the pathogen. Genes related to these pathways were more significantly enriched in wild AM rice than in cultivated AM rice in response to M. oryzae. On the other hand, genes associated with the 'brassinosteroid biosynthesis' were more enriched in cultivated AM rice.The AMF R. intraradices-colonized rice plants exhibited greater resistance to M. oryzae than non-AMF-colonized plants. The findings of the current study demonstrate the potential effects of crop domestication on the benefits received by the host via root  with AMF(s), and provide new information on the underlying molecular mechanisms. In addition, results of this study can also help develop guidelines for the applications of AMF(s) when planting rice.</p><p>Keyword:['colonization']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29442208>The role of acyl-CoA thioesterase ACOT8I in mediating intracellular  in oleaginous fungus Mortierella alpina.</a></h2><p>Thioesterases (TEs) play an essential role in the  of fatty acids (FAs).

Dietary CLA lowered EPA-, DHA-, and ALA-derived epoxides, ARA-derived ketones and epoxides, and ALA-derived alcohols. While dietary CLA induced variable effects in EPA-, DHA-, and LNA-derived alcohols and LNA-derived ketones, it elevated ARA-derived alcohols and PGF, PGF, and F2-isoprostanes. DHA counteracted CLA-induced effects in 67, 57, 43, and 29% of total DHA-, ARA-, EPA-, and ALA-derived oxylipins, respectively.

Here, we investigated (i) the extent to which PUFAs and Cd impact fatty  homeostasis and  in these cells and (ii) possible mechanisms by which specific PUFAs may confer cytoprotection against Cd. First, RTL-W1 cells were cultivated for one week in growth media spiked with 50 μmol L of either  (ALA, 18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n-3), linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6) or arachidonic  (AA, 20:4n-6) in order to modulate their fatty  profile. Then, the cells were challenged with Cd (0, 50 or 100 μmol L) for 24 h prior to assaying viability, fatty  profile, intracellular Cd content, proteomic landscape and expression levels of genes involved in fatty  , synthesis of PUFA-derived signalling molecules and stress response. We observed that the fatty  supply and, to a lesser extent, the exposure to Cd influenced cellular fatty  homeostasis and . The cellular fatty  composition of fish liver cells modulated their tolerance to an acute Cd challenge. Enrichments in ALA, EPA, and, to a lesser extent, AA conferred cytoprotection while enrichment in LA had no impact on cell viability. The present study ruled out the possibility that cytoprotection reflects a decreased Cd burden. Our results rather suggest that the PUFA-derived cytoprotection against Cd occurs through a reduction of the oxidative stress induced by Cd and a differential induction of the eicosanoid cascade, with a possible role of peroxiredoxin and glutaredoxin (antioxidant enzymes) as well as cytosolic phospholipase A2 (enzyme initiating the eicosanoid cascade).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

There are scant data regarding how the content of non-essential fatty acids like monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) impact the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In this work, we tested the hypothesis that obesogenic diets enriched in oleic  (OA; 18:1n-9) reduce polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) levels vs an obesogenic diet enriched in SFAs. Adult male mice were fed for eight weeks either (1) a control 16% fat energy (en) diet with 5.7% en OA and 4.4% en SFA, (2) a 50% fat en diet with 33% en OA and 9.9% en SFA, or (3) a 50% en diet with a high SFA diet with 33% en SFA and 9.1% en OA. Dietary levels and intake of linoleic  (LA; 18:2n-6) and α- (ALA; 18:3n-3) were constant between the experimental groups. Several peripheral organs (liver, heart, kidney, and adipose) were analyzed for lipid composition and oxylipin analysis was performed for liver and adipose. Our data demonstrate that a high OA diet reduced tissue content of LA and ALA (≥30%) in phospholipid and neutral lipid fractions, reduced the content of some LA-derived and ALA-derived oxylipins in liver and adipose, and conversely, elevated hepatic content of PGF. In all tissues examined, except for adipose, levels of arachidonic  (ARA; 20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) were either elevated or unaffected by the obesogenic diets.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary supplementation with moderate levels of ALNA, gamma- (GLA), arachidonic  (ARA), DHA, or FO on inflammatory cell numbers and functions and on circulating levels of soluble adhesion molecules. Healthy subjects aged 55 to 75 yr consumed nine capsules per day for 12 wk. The capsules contained placebo oil (an 80:20 mix of palm and sunflowerseed oils) or blends of placebo oil with oils rich in ALNA, GLA, ARA, or DHA or FO. Subjects in these groups consumed 2 g ALNA; approximately 700 mg GLA, ARA, or DHA; or 1 g EPA plus DHA (720 mg EPA + 280 mg DHA) daily from the capsules. Total fat intake from the capsules was 4 g per day. None of the treatments affected inflammatory cell numbers in the bloodstream; neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis or respiratory burst in response to E. coli; production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide; or plasma concentrations of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1. In contrast, the ALNA and FO treatments decreased the plasma concentrations of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (16 and 28% decrease, respectively) and soluble E-selectin (23 and 17% decrease, respectively). It is concluded that, in contrast to previous reports using higher amounts of these fatty acids, a moderate increase in consumption of long-chain n-6 or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids does not significantly affect inflammatory cell numbers or neutrophil and monocyte responses in humans and so would not be expected to cause immune impairment. Furthermore, we conclude that moderate levels of ALNA and FO, which could be incorporated into the diet, can decrease some markers of endothelial activation and that this mechanism of action may contribute to the reported health benefits of n-3 fatty acids.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28931585>Fatty  Proportions in Plasma Cholesterol Esters and Phospholipids Are Positively Correlated in Various Swedish Populations.</a></h2><p> Fatty  (FA) proportions in cholesterol esters (CEs) and plasma phospholipids are widely used as dietary biomarkers.

In the current study, obese Zucker rats displayed decreased phospholipid (PL) content in association with hepatic lipid abundance, and therefore, we examined whether ALA and exercise training would prevent these abnormalities differently to reveal additive effects on the liver. To achieve this aim, obese Zucker rats were fed control diet alone or supplemented with ALA and were sedentary or exercise trained for 4 wk (C-Sed, ALA-Sed, C-Ex, and ALA-Ex). ALA-Sed rats had increased microsomal-triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP), a protein required for lipoprotein assembly/secretion, as well as modestly increased PL content in the absence of improvements in mitochondrial content, lipid accumulation, or insulin sensitivity. In contrast, C-Ex rats had increased mitochondrial content and insulin sensitivity; however, this corresponded with minimal improvements in PL content and hepatic lipid accumulation. Importantly, ALA-Ex rats demonstrated additive improvements in PL content and hepatic steatosis, which corresponded with increased mitochondrial content, MTTP and apolipoprotein B100 content, greater serum triacylglyceride, and insulin sensitivity.

At baseline, trained investigators graded the severity of facial skin photoaging using a validated 6-grade scale during a clinical examination. Intake of α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosapentaenoic (DPA), and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) were evaluated by dietary source using ten 24-h dietary record questionnaires during the first 2.5 years of the follow-up period.After adjustment for possible confounders, severe photoaging was found to be inversely associated with higher intake of ALA in men and with higher intake of EPA in women. When considering the different food sources of ALA for men, an inverse association appeared between severe photoaging and ALA from vegetable oils, as well as with ALA from fruit and vegetables, whereas no association was observed for ALA from dairy products. In women, ALA from vegetable oils also tended to be inversely linked to photoaging.These findings suggest a possible benefit effect of n-3 PUFAs on skin aging.

In the human body, these fatty acids (FAs) give rise to arachidonic  (ARA, n-6), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, n-3), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, n-3) that play key roles in regulating body homeostasis. Locally acting bioactive signaling lipids called eicosanoids derived from these FAs also regulate diverse homeostatic processes. In general, ARA gives rise to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids whereas EPA and DHA give rise to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. Thus, a proportionally higher consumption of n-3 PUFAs can protect us against inflammatory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and other chronic diseases. The present review summarizes major sources, intake, and global consumption of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs. Their metabolism to biosynthesize long-chain PUFAs and eicosanoids and their roles in brain metabolism, cardiovascular disease, , cancer, and bone health are also discussed.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TSL 95% ethanol extract exhibited the highest transactivity of PPARγ and contained the highest amounts of natural PPARγ ligands including palmitic , linoleic , and α- among different TSL ethanol extracts (0, 10, 50, 70, and 95%). The efficacy and the mechanism of TSL ethanol extract (95%) mediated anti-diabetic effects were examined by both in vivo and in vitro models in this study. An improved whole-body insulin sensitivity was observed in high-fat diet-fed (HFD) mice after 14 weeks of TSL treatment, as evidenced by a faster rate of plasma glucose clearing. The improved insulin sensitivity was through direct stimulation of PPARγ and adiponectin expression in adipose tissues of HFD mice. In addition to the PPARγ pathway, TSL stimulated glucose uptake via directly inducing AMPKα but not AS160 activation in C2C12 myotubes under palmitate-induced insulin resistance. TSL successfully induced sirtuin 1 and restored PGC1α, but failed to restore mitochondrial electron transport complexes I, III, IV and V in mRNA levels. Loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential coupled with AMPK activation suggests that TSL acts as a mitochondrial inhibitor to stimulate AMPK-mediated glucose uptake. This study demonstrated that TSL stimulated glucose uptake via AMPK activation in skeletal muscles and promoted PPARγ and normalized adiponectin expression in adipose tissues, thereby ameliorating insulin resistance.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'insulin resistance', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25465563>Increasing intake of essential fatty acids from milk replacer benefits performance, immune responses, and health of preweaned Holstein calves.</a></h2><p>The objective was to evaluate the effect of feeding increasing amounts of essential fatty acids (FA) in milk replacer (MR) during the first 60 d of life on growth, health, and  of Holstein calves. Calves were born from dams fed low concentrations of total and essential FA during the lasT2 mo of pregnancy. Newborn calves were blocked by sex and parity of the dam and assigned randomly to receive 1 of 4 MR treatments (T). Hydrogenated coconut oil and soybean oil were mixed with emulsifier and commercial MR powder to prepare the following 4 MR containing 0.119 and 0.007 (T1), 0.187 and 0.017 (T2), 0.321 and 0.036 (T3), and 0.593 and 0.076 (T4) g of intake per kg of metabolic body weight (BW(0.75)) of linoleic  and α-, respectively. At 30 d of life, concentrations of essential FA (linoleic  and α-) in liver increased, whereas concentrations of C12:0, C14:0, C16:0, and C20:3n-9 decreased linearly with increasing intake of essential FA. Body weight gain and feed efficiency were optimized when male calves consumed T2, whereas gain by female calves tended to increase linearly with increasing intake of essential FA during the first 30 d of age. However, these responses to treatment were not maintained after initiation of concentrate feeding at 31 d of life. Over the 60-d preweaning period, wither and hip heights were improved in both sexes as intake of essential FA increased up to T3. Some measures of health and  were affected by replacing some coconut oil with soybean oil. Severity of diarrhea tended to decrease linearly; plasma concentrations of haptoglobin during diarrhea were lower in T2, T3, and T4; phagocytosis by blood neutrophils tended to peak for calves fed T2; in vitro proliferation of stimulated blood lymphocytes was greater for calves fed T2; in vitro stimulated blood cells produced more IFN-γ (up to T3 for males and T2 for females), concentrations of serum IgG against ovalbumin injections were increased in males fed T2 or T3; and skin-fold thickness increased in response to an intradermal antigen injection of all calves fed up to T4. Across sex and under the conditions of the present study, mean daily intakes of linoleic  between 3 to 5g/d and intakes of α- between 0.3 and 0.6g/d during the first 30 d of life promoted growth of preweaned Holstein calves, possibly by improving their immune status.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the Chia oil- or HxT-enriched-RP effect on the lipoprotein profile of aged rats fed high-, high-energy, and cholesterol-enriched diets. RP samples were prepared by mixing lean pork and lard with or without Chia oil (152.2 g/kg fresh matter) or HxT (3.6 g/kg fresh matter). Diets were prepared by mixing a semisynthetic diet with freeze-dried RP. Groups of 1-year male Wistar rats were fed the following experimental diets for 8 weeks: C, control-RP diet; HC, cholesterol-enriched-RP diet; and Chia oil-RP (CHIA) and HxT, Chia oil- or hydroxytyrosol-RP, cholesterol-enriched diet. Plasma , lipoprotein profile, SREBP-1c protein, and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) receptor gene () expressions were evaluated. Compared to C diet, the HC diet increased plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, total lipids, and SREBP-1c expression, but reduced  expression and significantly modified the lipoprotein profile, giving rise to the presence of high levels of atherogenic cholesterol-enriched very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) particles. Compared to the HC diet, the HxT diet did not produce significant changes in feed intake but it reduced the body weight. Chia oil and HxT partially arrested the negative effects of the high-, high-energy, and cholesterol-enriched meat-based diets on lipemia and lipoproteinemia, mostly by reducing the amount of cholesterol content in VLDL (60% and 74% less in CHIA and HxT vs. HC, respectively) and the VLDL total mass (59% and 63% less in CHIA and HxT vs. HC, respectively). Free fatty acids (FFA) significantly correlated with adipose tissue weight and VLDL total mass (both  < 0.05), and plasma triglycerides, phospholipids, total lipids, and SREBP-1c (all  < 0.001), suggesting the important role of FFA in lipoprotein .

To acknowledge the molecular mechanisms of freezing tolerance in winter turnip rape, two  genotypes, freezing stressed after the induction of cold acclimation, were used to compare the proteomic profiles of roots by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). Under freezing stress (-4 °C) for 8 h, 139 and 96 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were identified in the roots of "Longyou7" (freezing-tolerant) and "Tianyou4" (freezing-sensitive), respectively. Among these DAPs, 91 and 48 proteins were up- and down-accumulated in "Longyou7", respectively, and 46 and 50 proteins were up- and down-accumulated in "Tianyou4", respectively.

Of the chosen clinical trials, only one was not randomized. Five of the studies were blind experiments. Two of the studies were acute trials, both of them randomized. Of the chia seed interventions, one study showed a significant drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and inflammatory markers, yet there was no change in body mass, lipid profile or blood sugar. In four of the studies reviewed there was a significant spike in ALA and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), with no significant change to other parameters. In the acute trials, post-prandial blood sugar was significantly lower. Only one study showed a significant drop in triglycerides (TG), body mass and inflammatory markers; however, the chia seed in that case was mixed with other foods. Most of the studies showed unclear or low risk of bias. Two studies showed a high risk of bias because not all the pre-specified primary outcomes were reported in the findings.most of the studies did not demonstrate statistically significant results in relation to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The evidence regarding the relationship between chia seed consumption and cardiovascular risk factors are insufficient, and the studies included in this review present numerous limitations.

Especially dietary intake of n-3 PUFA and a lowered n-6:n-3 ratio are highly encouraged due to beneficial and diminishing effects on basal cortisol secretions. However, the time of such effects to occur and how plasma PUFA patterns affect cortisol concentrations in the short-term was rarely investigated. In order to address this, we supplemented forty male and forty female guinea pigs with diets high in the essential PUFA α- (ALA, 18 : 3n-3) and linoleic  (LA, 18 : 2n-6) for 20 d. Saliva cortisol concentrations in relation to altering plasma PUFA patterns during this time span were analysed in a repeated measurement design both during basal conditions (individual housing) in 5-d intervals and during stressful social confrontations. We detected very fast plasma PUFA accumulation rates, corresponding to the major dietary PUFA, which resulted in plasma PUFA plateau phases after 10 d. ALA negatively and LA positively affected saliva cortisol concentrations throughout the study. A positive effect of the plasma n-6:n-3 ratio on saliva cortisol concentrations was detected during peak plasma PUFA accumulations and social confrontations, while no effects were detected in relation to plasma PUFA plateau phases. These results suggest that the plasma n-6:n-3 ratio diminishes HPA axis activity during altered physiological conditions only and highlights the importance of altering plasma PUFA patterns for HPA axis functions and the control of  balance and physiological stress.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27586532>Isolation and Proteomic Analysis of a  Mutant with Enhanced Lipid Production by the Gamma Irradiation Method.</a></h2><p>In this study, an enhanced lipid-producing mutant strain of the microalga  was developed by gamma irradiation.

Autoimmunity may have a pathogenic role in a subgroup of autistic children. This study is the first to investigate the relationship between serum levels of anti-myelin basic protein (anti-MBP) brain-specific auto-antibodies and reduced plasma levels of PUFAs in autistic children. Plasma levels of PUFAs (including linoleic, alphalinolenic, arachidonic "AA" and docosahexaenoic "DHA" acids) and serum anti-MBP were measured in 80 autistic children, aged between 4 and 12 years, and 80 healthy-matched children. Autistic patients had significantly lower plasma levels of PUFAs than healthy children. On the other hand, ω6/ω3 ratio (AA/DHA) was significantly higher in autistic patients than healthy children. Low plasma DHA, AA,  and linoleic acids were found in 67.5%, 50%, 40% and 35%, respectively of autistic children. On the other hand, 70% of autistic patients had elevated ω6/ω3 ratio. Autistic patients with increased serum levels of anti-MBP auto-antibodies (75%) had significantly lower plasma DHA (P<0.5) and significantly higher ω6/ω3 ratio (P<0.5) than patients who were seronegative for these antibodies. In conclusions, some autistic children have a significant positive association between reduced levels of plasma DHA and increased serum levels of anti-MBP brain-specific auto-antibodies. However, replication studies of larger samples are recommended to validate whether reduced levels of plasma PUFAs are a mere association or have a role in the induction of the production of anti-MBP in some autistic children.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The model includes 852 genes, 2,731 reactions, and 2,277 metabolites, while  is described using the SLIMEr formalism allowing direct integration of  class and acyl chain experimental distribution data. The simulation results confirmed that the R. toruloides model provides valid growth predictions on glucose, xylose, and glycerol, while prediction of genetic engineering targets to increase production of , triacylglycerols, and carotenoids identified genes-some of which have previously been engineered to successfully increase production. This renders rtho-GEM valuable for future studies to improve the production of other oleochemicals of industrial relevance including value-added fatty acids and carotenoids, in addition to facilitate system-wide omics-data analysis in R. toruloides. Expanding the portfolio of GEMs for -accumulating fungi contributes to both understanding of metabolic mechanisms of the oleaginous phenotype but also uncover particularities of the  production machinery in R. toruloides.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27539101>Fatty  profile in erythrocyte membranes and plasma phospholipids affects significantly the extent of inflammatory response to coronary stent implantation.</a></h2><p>In coronary heart disease, the treatment of significant stenosis by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation elicits local and systemic inflammatory responses. This study was aimed at evaluation of the dynamics of inflammatory response and elucidation of the relationship between the fatty  profile of red blood cell (RBC) membranes or plasma phospholipids and  after PCI. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum amyloid A (SAA), malondialdehyde (MDA) and the fatty  profiles were determined in patients with advanced coronary artery disease undergoing PCI before, 24 h and 48 h after drug-eluting stent implantation (n=36). Patients after PCI exhibited a significant increase in studied markers (hsCRP, IL-6, SAA, MDA). Many significant associations were found between the increase of IL-6, resp. SAA and the amounts of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (namely linoleic, dihomo-gamma-, docosatetraenoic and docosapentaenoic ), resp. saturated fatty acids (pentadecanoic, stearic, nonadecanoic) in erythrocyte membranes. The magnitude of the inflammatory response to PCI is related to erythrocyte membrane fatty  profile, which seems to be a better potential predictor of elevation of inflammatory markers after PCI than plasma phospholipids.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29659487>Cultivar and Harvest Month Influence the Nutrient Content of  spp. Cactus Pear Cladode Mucilage Extracts.</a></h2><p>Mucilage extracted from cactus pear cladodes is a hydrocolloid gum.

Yet, the cultivar with the most optimal nutrient content and the preferred harvest times are as yet unknown. For this reason, mucilage from three  (Algerian, Morado and Gymno-Carpo) and one  (Robusta) cultivar were investigated to determine their nutrient content over six months. Nutrients that contribute  (10.2 kJ/g) were low. The mineral content was high (ash 17.7/100 g), particularly calcium (3.0 g/100 g) and phosphorous (109.5 mg/kg). Low insoluble -detergent fibre (1.4 g/kg) and neutral-detergent fibre (2.1 g/kg) values indicated that mucilage was mostly soluble fibre. Calcium oxalate crystals were not detected in dried mucilage.  powders had higher protein, extractable fat and potassium content, while  mucilage powders had higher polyunsaturated (Linoleic and α-) fat content.  Robusta mucilage, harvested after the fruit harvest (February) had the lowest  content and the highest mineral and protein content. Mucilage powders were highly soluble, low-kilojoule and mineral-rich. This is a functional ingredient that is produced from an easily cultivated crop, as cactus pears grow in areas with poor soil, extremely high daytime temperatures and limited water supplies.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26415675>Emu oil decreases atherogenic plaque formation in cafeteria diet-induced obese rats.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis-induced coronary heart disease - caused by elevated levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and inflammation - is one of the most prevalent diseases. Monounsaturated fatty acids are reported to prevent atherosclerosis; emu oil is a rich source of monounsaturated fatty , and we hypothesize that emu oil supplementation could lower inflammation and prevent atherosclerosis in diet-induced obese (DIO) animals. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 6), and fed with normal diet (chow pellet; ND), or with cafeteria diet (CD), or with CD along with emu oil supplementation at three different doses: ED1 (2 mL), ED2 (4 mL) and ED3 (8 mL) kg(-1) body weight (BW), respectively.After 12 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and serum was analysed for measuring lipid profile, C-reactive proteins, testosterone and luteinizing hormone. Histopathological studies were performed to observe atherogenic changes in thoracic aorta. Restoration of altered lipid and hormonal profiles, and inhibition of atherogenic changes in thoracic aorta, were observed with supplementation of emu oil, confirming its anti-atherosclerotic activity.The high content of oleic  in emu oil could have orchestrated - either solely or in combination with linoleic and  acids - causing the upregulation of testosterone biosynthesis and inhibition of atheromatous plaque formation in diet-induced obese animals. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2117922>Uptake and incorporation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids into macrophage lipids and their effect upon macrophage adhesion and phagocytosis.</a></h2><p>Murine thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were cultured in the presence of a variety of fatty acids added as complexes with bovine serum albumin. All fatty acids tested were taken up readily by the cells and both neutral and phospholipid fractions were enriched with the fatty  provided in the medium. This generated a range of cells enriched in saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, including n-3 acids of fish oil origin. Saturated fatty  enrichment enhanced macrophage adhesion to both tissue culture plastic and bacterial plastic compared with enrichment with polyunsaturated fatty acids. Macrophages enriched with the saturated fatty acids myristate or palmitate showed decreases of 28% and 21% respectively in their ability to phagocytose unopsonized zymosan particles. Those enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids showed 25-55% enhancement of phagocytic capacity. The greatest rate of uptake was with arachidonate-enriched cells. Phagocytic rate was highly correlated with the saturated/unsaturated fatty  ratio, percentage of polyunsaturated fatty  and index of unsaturation, except for macrophages enriched with fish-oil-derived fatty acids; they showed lower phagocytic activity than expected on the basis of their degree of unsaturation. These results suggest that membrane fluidity is important in determining macrophage adhesion and phagocytic activity. However, in the case of phagocytosis, this effect may be partially overcome if the cells are enriched with fish-oil-derived fatty acids. Thus it may be possible to modulate the activity of cells of the immune system, and so an immune response, by dietary lipid manipulation.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29702246>Placental lipid droplet composition: Effect of a lifestyle intervention (UPBEAT) in obese pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Maternal  is associated with adverse outcomes.

Placenta MFSD2a expression was assessed by western blot. Placental LDs from obese women were comprised of predominantly saturated and monounsaturated FAs. TG and Chol composition was similar between intervention (n = 20) and control (n = 23) groups. PCs containing dihomo-ɣ- in LD were positively associated with gestational weight gain (P < 0.007), and lowered by the intervention. In the whole sample, PCs carrying DHA and arachidonic  were inversely associated with placental weight. Placenta MFSD2a expression was associated with DHA cord blood metabolites and relationships were observed between LD lipids, especially DHA carrying species, and cord blood metabolites.

To overcome challenges in its sustainable production, a formulated diet is required for imparting health and robustness. This study evaluates the effect of dietary supplementation with arachidonic  (ARA; 20:4n-6) on growth, survival, immune function and fatty  composition of red blood cells (RBCs) in rabbitfish. We conducted two feeding trials using juvenile fish (to evaluate growth and survival) and adults (to evaluate immune function and fatty  incorporation). Fish were fed diets supplemented with three different levels of ARA (in % of total fatty acids): 0.6 (unsupplemented control), 2.6 (moderate) and 4.7 (high). The fish fed with moderate ARA levels exhibited improved (p < 0.05) growth over the control and the high ARA level groups. During an outbreak of Streptococcus iniae, fish fed with moderate ARA survived significantly (p < 0.05) better (89%) than the control and the high ARA groups (59% and 48%, respectively). Moderate ARA supplementation resulted in elevated lysozyme and complement levels in the plasma of rabbitfish. A significant increase in the total serum immunoglobulin levels was observed in both the medium and the high ARA level groups; however, a decrease in antiprotease activity was recorded in the supplemented groups as compared to the control. Fatty  analysis in fish red blood cells revealed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the proportion of ARA of total fatty acids in the groups fed with the medium and the high ARA level diets (9.5% and 11.2%, respectively, compared to 7.1% in the control). Concomitantly, there was a decrease in the proportion of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; 20:5n-3), dihomo-γ  (DGLA; 20:3n-6) and several 18-carbon unsaturated fatty acids in these groups. In conclusion, ARA in rabbitfish feeds improved growth, survival as well as innate and acquired humoral immune functions. Thus ARA supplementation in the diet of this species could be a valuable step towards establishing the commercial culture of rabbitfish.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Statins represent one of the most important discoveries to have been made in the field of cardiovascular medicine in recent decades. Their beneficial cardiovascular effects, which have reduced the number of fatal events in patients with atherosclerosis, encompass more than their ability to lower cholesterol levels. The pleiotropic effects of statins involve their anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet properties and their ability to normalize endothelial function. In addition, these drugs may display antiarrhythmic activity, improve  sensitivity and counteract hypertension and obesity. The low rate of coronary disease documented in Eskimos corroborates the cardioprotective effects of the n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids beyond their hypolipemic effects. The reduction of CVD-related deaths attributable to the action of α- fatty  appears to be related to its strong antiarrhythmic properties. In addition, as a precursor of EPA and this last fatty  of thromboxane A3, prostacyclin I3, serie-3 prostaglandines and serie 5-leukotrines and inhibitor/modulator of thromboxane A2, prostacyclin I2, serie-2 prostaglandines and serie 4-leukotrienes formation, the α- may reduce inflammation and thrombogenesis. As results of some studies suggest that the combined use of statins and n-3 PUFA improves cardiovascular protection and reduces the CVD-related mortality rate; the paper also reviews the possible synergism between both groups of compounds on CVD treatment and concludes that clear benefits may be obtained.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28552045>Erythrocyte polyunsaturated fatty  composition is associated with depression and FADS genotype in Caucasians.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play an important role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), related, in part, to their role in inflammatory systems. The enzymes δ-5 and δ-6 desaturase are the rate-limiting steps in the metabolism of PUFAs and are encoded in the genes fatty  desaturase (FADS) 1 and 2, respectively. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes within the FADS gene cluster have been shown to influence PUFA composition.The objective of this study was to determine whether key omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids may be associated with depression, and to explore the role of FADS genotype in PUFA variation.Four erythrocyte long chain (LC) fatty acids (linoleic  [LA], α- [ALA], arachidonic  [AA] and Eicosapentaenoic  [EPA]), as well as six SNPs (rs174537, rs174547, rs174570, rs174575, rs498793 and rs3834458) within the FADS gene cluster were measured in a sample of 207 participants (154 with MDD versus 53 non-depressed controls).The precursor LC-PUFAs LA and ALA appeared to be negatively associated with depression (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively), while AA:LA (surrogate measure of desaturase activity) was positively associated with depression (P < 0.01). No significant differences were noted in erythrocyte EPA, AA or AA:EPA between groups. Minor alleles of each SNP (excluding rs498793) were associated with variation in desaturase activity and LA. Both rs174537 and rs174547 were associated with ALA. No genotype was associated with EPA or AA. Minor alleles of rs174537 and rs174547 were significantly associated with lower odds of MDD (although significance was lost after correction for multiple comparisons).Precursor LC-PUFAs, LA and ALA, appear to be associated with MDD and potentially modulated by genetic variation in the FADS gene cluster. These results provide support for the consideration of PUFA composition, diet and FADS genetic variation in the pathophysiology of MDD.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887939>Fatty acids: a role for Africa?</a></h2><p>Health effects of fatty acids have been very controversial. Total mortality is inversely associated with the amount of total fat consumed. In contrast, trans fatty acids or SFA intake is positively related to mortality while the inverse is observed with consumption of MUFA or PUFA. Among PUFA, long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFA have many beneficial effects. Dietary intake of some types of fatty acids is specific to Africa.  from saturated fat does not exceed 14% and  from n-6 PUFA does not exceed 8% of total  intake. Dietary intake of LC n-3 PUFA is less than 100 mg/d whereas international recommendations promote 250-500 mg/d. Consumption of plant n-3 PUFA mainly α- (ALA) is highly variable depending on the country. Both fish and ALA availability are low in several African countries. The prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular events remain very low in Africa, partly explained by the fact that the whole dietary pattern is globally the best of all continents. One objective of 'fat for Africa' could be to increase, as much as possible, the dietary intake of LC n-3 PUFA by promoting sustainable aquaculture and to maintain as much as possible traditional dietary pattern by preventing a tendency to westernisation, provided that the amount of  and protein is sufficient to fight against wasting and stunting where it still exists.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28950768>Induction of plant disease resistance upon treatment with yeast cell wall extract.</a></h2><p>It has been reported that treatment with yeast cell wall extract (YCWE) induces PDF1 and PR-1 gene expression; these transcripts are important markers of plant disease resistance, though the detailed signaling mechanisms that induce these defense responses are still unknown.

Although a broad diversity of oxylipins is known in the algae, no CYP74s or related enzymes have been detected in brown algae yet. Cloning of the first CYP74-related gene CYP5164B1 of brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus is reported in present work. The recombinant protein was incubated with several fatty  hydroperoxides. Linoleic  9-hydroperoxide (9-HPOD) was the preferred substrate, while linoleate 13-hydroperoxide (13-HPOD) was less efficient. α- 9- and 13-hydroperoxides, as well as eicosapentaenoic  15-hydroperoxide were inefficient substrates. Both 9-HPOD and 13-HPOD were converted into epoxyalcohols. For instance, 9-HPOD was turned primarily into (9S,10S,11S,12Z)-9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic . Both epoxide and hydroxyl  atoms of the epoxyalcohol were incorporated mostly from [O]9-HPOD. Thus, the enzyme exhibits the activity of epoxyalcohol synthase (EsEAS). The results show that the EsEAS isomerizes the hydroperoxides into epoxyalcohols via epoxyallylic radical, a common intermediate of different CYP74s and related enzymes. EsEAS can be considered as an archaic prototype of CYP74 family enzymes.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies showed that selenium (Se) status altered the expression of oxylipids and magnitude of inflammatory responses. Although selenoproteins are thought to mediate many of the biological effects of Se, the direct effect of selenoproteins on the production of oxylipids is unknown. Therefore, the role of decreased selenoprotein activity in modulating the production of biologically active oxylipids from macrophages was investigated. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were collected from wild-type and myeloid-cell-specific selenoprotein knockout mice to analyze oxylipid production by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry as well as oxylipid biosynthetic enzyme and inflammatory marker gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Decreased selenoprotein activity resulted in the accumulation of reactive  species, enhanced cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase expression and decreased oxylipids with known anti-inflammatory properties such as arachidonic -derived lipoxin A₄ (LXA₄) and linoleic -derived 9-​oxo-octadecadienoic  (9-oxoODE). Treating RAW 264.7 macrophages with LXA₄ or 9-oxoODE diminished oxidant-induced macrophage inflammatory response as indicated by decreased production of TNFα. The results show for the first time that selenoproteins are important for the balanced biosynthesis of pro- and anti-inflammatory oxylipids during inflammation. A better understanding of the Se-dependent control mechanisms governing oxylipid biosynthesis may uncover nutritional intervention strategies to counteract the harmful effects of uncontrolled inflammation due to oxylipids.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A recent pilot clinical trial assessing the effects of ALA-rich dietary flaxseed on tumor biological markers in postmenopausal patients with primary breast cancer demonstrated significant reductions in tumor growth and in HER2 (erbB-2) oncogene expression.The molecular mechanism by which ALA inhibits breast cancer cell growth and metastasis formation may involve a direct regulation of HER2, a well-characterized oncogene playing a key role in the etiology, progression and response to some chemo- and endocrine therapies in approximately 20% of breast carcinomas.Using HER2-specific ELISA, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blotting, RT-PCR and HER2 promoter-reporter analyses, we characterized the effects of exogenous supplementation with ALA on the expression of HER2 oncogene, a master key player in the onset and metastasis formation of breast cancer disease. Metabolic status (MTT) assays were performed to evaluate the nature of the cytotoxic interaction between ALA and the humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin). To study these issues we used BT-474 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cells, which naturally exhibit amplification of the HER2 oncogene.ALA treatment dramatically suppressed the expression of HER2-coded p185Her-2/neu oncoprotein as determined by ELISA, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting techniques. Interestingly, ALA-induced down-regulation of p185Her-2/neu correlated with a transcriptional response as no HER2 mRNA signal could be detected by RT-PCR upon treatment with optimal concentrations of ALA (up to 20 microM). Consistent with these findings, ALA exposure was found to dramatically repress the activity of a Luciferase reporter gene driven by the HER2 promoter. Moreover, the nature of the cytotoxic interaction between ALA and trastuzumab (Herceptin) revealed a significant synergism as assessed by MTT-based cell viability assays.i) These findings reveal that the omega-3 PUFA ALA suppresses overexpression of HER2 oncogene at the transcriptional level, which, in turn, interacts synergistically with anti-HER2 trastuzumab- based . ii) Our results molecularly support a recent randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial suggesting that ALA may be a potential dietary alternative or adjunct to currently used drugs in the management of HER2-positive breast carcinomas. iii) Considering our previous findings demonstrating the <<HER2 upregulatory actions>> of the omega-6 PUFA  (LA; 18:2n-6) and the <<HER2 down-regulatory actions >> of the omega-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) and of the omega-9 monounsaturated fatty  oleic  (OA; 18:1n-9), it is reasonable to suggest that a low omega-6/omega-3 PUFA ratio and elevated MUFA levels, the two prominent <<fat features>> of the <<Mediterranean diet>>, should be extremely efficient at blocking HER2 expression in breast cancer cells.</p><p>Keyword:['immunotherapy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344992>A panel of free fatty  ratios to predict the development of metabolic abnormalities in healthy obese individuals.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidences support that metabolically healthy obese (MHO) is a transient state.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between erythrocyte membrane fatty  (EMFA) levels and cardiac autonomic function in obese children using heart rate variability (HRV).A total of 48 obese and 32 healthy children were included in this case-control study. Anthropometric and biochemical data, HRV indices, and EMFA levels in both groups were compared statistically.HRV parameters including standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals (NN), root mean square of successive differences, the number of pairs of successive NNs that differ by >50 ms (NN50), the proportion of NN50 divided by the total number of NNs, high-frequency power, and low-frequency power were lower in obese children compared to controls, implying parasympathetic impairment. Eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  levels were lower in the obese group (p<0.001 and p=0.012, respectively). In correlation analysis, in the obese group, body mass index standard deviation and linoleic , arachidonic , triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein levels showed a linear correlation with one or more HRV parameter, and age, eicosapentaenoic , and systolic and diastolic blood pressure correlated with mean heart rate. In linear regression analysis, age, dihomo-gamma-, linoleic , arachidonic , body mass index standard deviation, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein were related to HRV parameters, implying an effect on cardiac autonomic function.There is impairment of cardiac autonomic function in obese children. It appears that levels of EMFAs such as linoleic , arachidonic  and dihomo-gamma- play a role in the regulation of cardiac autonomic function in obese children.Copyright © 2017 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

We hypothesized that dietary α- (ALA, 18:3 n-3) favors NO availability by modulating amino  metabolism, with a specific impact on the arginine-NO pathway. Mice were fed a hyperlipidic diet (285 g lipid/kg, 51.1 % energy), rich in either saturated fatty acids (SFA, provided by palm oil, PALM group) or ALA (provided by linseed oil, LIN group). We measured whole-body NO synthesis and systemic arginine hydrolysis with a tracer-based method, plasma concentration of related metabolites, and hepatic mRNA level of related enzymes, and the study was completed by a transcriptomic analysis in the liver. As expected with this model, hyperlipidic diets resulted in increased adiposity and glycemia after 5 weeks. As compared to PALM mice, LIN mice had a higher plasma nitrite and nitrate concentration, a higher whole-body conversion of arginine into NO vs urea, and a similar plasma concentration of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), despite a higher expression of the liver dimethylargininase-1. In LIN mice, there was a higher expression of genes involved in PPARα signaling, but a little impact on gene expression related to amino acids and arginine metabolism. This effect cannot be directly ascribed to changes in arginase activity in the liver or ADMA metabolism, nor to direct regulation of the related target genes.

The FXS and FXO groups received equivalent amounts of  (ALA; 7.4 g/day).The primary outcome measures were fasting plasma hemoglobin A(1c), glucose, , and phospholipid fatty  composition. The secondary outcome measures were fasting circulating leptin and adiponectin, as well as body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference. Dietary intake assessment and calculations for homeostasis model assessment for  and quantified  sensitivity check were also completed.The FXS and FXO groups had increases in plasma phospholipid n-3 fatty acids (ALA, eicosapentaenoic  [EPA], or decosapentaenoic  [DPA], but not docosahexaenoic ), and the FXO group had more EPA and DPA in plasma phospholipids compared to the FXS group. All groups had similar caloric intakes; however, the CTL group experienced a 4% weight gain compared to baseline (p < 0.05), while both flax groups had constant body weights during the study period. All other parameters, including glycemic control, were unchanged by dietary treatment.Milled FXS and FXO intake does not affect glycemic control in adults with well-controlled type 2 diabetes.

We investigated whether oral omega-3 supplements affect IOP in normotensive adults.We undertook a pooled analysis of data from two double-masked, placebo-controlled randomized trials (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12614001019695, ACTRN12615000173594) that investigated the efficacy and safety of oral omega-3 supplementation for treating ocular surface . Recruitment involved adults ( = 105) with IOP <21 mm Hg, and without a current or prior glaucoma diagnosis. Participants were randomly allocated to either an oral omega-3 (∼1000 mg/day eicosapentaenoic  + ∼500 mg/day docosahexaenoic  ± 900 mg/day α-) or placebo (olive oil, 1500 mg/day) supplement. IOP was quantified at baseline and after 3 months of supplementation (day 90). Change in IOP, relative to baseline, was compared between groups.At baseline, participants were of similar age (omega-3/placebo groups: mean ± SEM, 33.7 ± 1.7,  = 72/35.6 ± 3.0 years,  = 33), sex (65%/79% female), and had similar IOP (14.3 ± 0.3/13.8 ± 0.5 mm Hg). At day 90, IOP was reduced to 13.6 ± 0.3 mm Hg in the omega-3 group; controls had a slight IOP increase to 14.2 ± 0.4 mm Hg ( < 0.05).Oral omega-3 supplementation for 3 months significantly reduced IOP in normotensive adults. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that omega-3 fatty acids lower IOP in humans.These findings justify further investigation into the therapeutic potential of omega-3 supplementation for reducing IOP, to prevent and/or treat conditions with IOP elevation, including ocular hypertension and glaucoma.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25981324>Polymorphisms of rs174616 in the FADS1-FADS2 gene cluster is associated with a reduced risk of type 2  in northern Han Chinese people.</a></h2><p>Several studies have shown associations between the composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in various tissues and type 2  (T2DM) development in European populations. Genetic variants of fatty  desaturase (FADS) contribute to the variations of PUFA composition. Here we have explored whether similar correlations are also true among Chinese Han people.A case-control study was employed to examine this correlation in Han Chinese people. The study included 421 healthy adults and 331 T2DM patients.The ratio of arachidonic /linoleic  (AA/LA), which reflects Δ6 desaturase activity, was significantly increased in T2DM patients. Furthermore, the ratio of eicosapentaenoic /α- (EPA/ALA), which reflects Δ5 desaturase activity, was markedly decreased in T2DM patients. Importantly, among four single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs174545, rs2072114, rs174602 and rs174616) in the FADS1-FADS2 gene cluster, only minor allele (T) of rs174616 was associated with decreased risk of T2DM in both codominant and dominant models after adjustment for age, gender and BMI. Furthermore, the ratio of AA/LA in both controls and T2DM was reduced in T carriers while an increased proportion of LA was seen in T2DM patients compared with control patients.These data suggest that in northern Han Chinese people, the minor allele (T) of rs174616 in the FADS1-FADS2 gene cluster is associated with a decreased conversion rate of LA to AA, which may contribute to decreased reduced risk of developing T2DM.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can be converted into lipid mediators here collectively named oxylipins. These include classical eicosanoids, but also pro-resolving mediators. A balanced production of pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving oxylipins is of importance for adequate inflammatory responses and subsequent return to homeostasis.Here we investigated if PUFA metabolism is disturbed in COPD patients.Free PUFA and oxylipin levels were measured in induced sputum samples from the Bergen COPD cohort and COPD exacerbation study using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, effects of whole cigarette smoke on PUFA metabolism in air-liquid interface cultures of primary bronchial epithelial cells were assessed.Significantly lower levels of free , linoleic  and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) were detected in sputum from stable COPD patients compared to controls. During acute exacerbation (AE), levels of free arachidonic  and docosapentaenoic  were higher than in stable COPD patients. Furthermore, levels of omega-3 EPA- and docosahexaenoic -derived oxylipins were lower in sputum from stable COPD patients compared to controls. Cyclooxygenase-2-converted mediators were mostly increased during AE. In vitro studies additionally showed that cigarette smoke exposure may also directly contribute to altered epithelial PUFA metabolism, and indirectly by causing airway epithelial remodelling.Our findings show significant differences in PUFA metabolism in COPD patients compared to controls, further changed during AE. Airway epithelial remodelling may contribute to these changes. These findings provide new insight in impaired inflammatory resolution in COPD.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Apple skin was investigated as a source of natural antioxidants. The phenolic compound composition and antioxidant properties of 21 selected apple genotypes were evaluated. The lipid stabilizing ability of the apple skin extracts was examined using an aqueous emulsion system of methyl linolenate. The total phenolic concentrations determined by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry of methanolic extracts of skins of the apple genotypes varied from 150 to 700 mg/100 g DW. The antioxidant capacity measured by Folin-Ciocalteu (16.2 to 34.1 mg GAE/100 g DW), ferric reducing antioxidant power (1.3 to 3.3 g TE/100 g DW),  radical absorbance capacity (5.2 to 14.2 g TE/100 g DW), and percent inhibition of oxidation of methyl linolenate (73.8% to 97.2%) varied among the apple genotypes.

The present study investigated the offspring of female rats fed semi-synthetic diets containing either 180 or 90g casein/kg with 70 g/kg (w/w) of either corn oil or soya oil during gestation. During lactation, the dams received stock diet, and the offspring were subsequently weaned onto the stock diet. The offspring of dams fed the low-protein diets were smaller at birth. At 25 weeks of age, the offspring were subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test. In the offspring of dams fed the diet containing soya oil, the area under the  curve was affected by the protein content of the maternal diet. There was no effect of protein on the area under the  curve in the offspring of dams fed the diet prepared with corn oil. There were no differences in plasma glucose concentrations. The levels of mRNA for acetyl-CoA carboxylase- in the livers of female offspring were affected by the protein and oil content of the maternal diet. The level of carnitine palmitoyl transferase mRNA was affected by the protein content of the maternal diet. The present study suggests that PUFA in the maternal diet can interact with protein metabolism to influence the development of the offspring.

The degradation in quality and excessive  accumulation in cultured C. idellus have long been attributed to possible alterations in the  of fish muscle tissues as a result of overnutrition from artificial diets. To investigate the effects of different diets on fish muscle quality, a large-scale metabolomics study was performed on 250 tails of C. idellus.The experimental fish were divided into four groups based on sex and diet-female artificial feed (FAF), female grass feed, male artificial feed (MAF), and male grass feed (MGF). After a 113-day rearing period, the artificial feed (AF) group showed a significantly higher total mass of muscle  (P < 0.01), with the FAF group being the highest. Metabolomics profiling based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed distinctive patterns of clustering according to the four groups. Overall, artificial feeding was associated with higher concentrations of docosapentaenoic , dihomo-gamma-, and arachidonic , whereas grass feeding was associated with elevated n-3 unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) such as eicosapentaenoic , , and gamma-. Artificial feeding also resulted in significant increased docosahexaenoic  in MAF muscle than in MGF fish, whereas there was no significance in the comparison of female samples. Metabolic pathway analyses using both targeted and untargeted approaches consistently revealed that arachidonic   and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways were significantly different between AF and grass fed groups.Our results suggest that grass is a better source of dietary fatty  and protein when compared to artificial feed.

The anti-hyperlipidemia effect was studied in a rat model of acute hyperlipidemia, which was induced by triton WR-1339. A new compound, integrinol (), together with nine known compounds, namely chamazulene (), acetylenes (E)-2 (), acetylenes (E)-3 (), eugenol (), palmitic  (), oleic  (), linoleic  (),  () and 12,13-epoxylinolenic  were isolated from the crude lipophilic extract of A. integrifolia. The LD50 value of the crude extract was more than 4g/kg. In Triton WR-1339-induced acute hyperlipidemia model, the crude lipophilic extract (200 mg/kg) significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) by 70% ( ≤ 0.01) and triglycerides (TGs) by 94% ( ≤ 0.001). The fractioned compounds, such as chamazulene (1), acetylene-2 (2), and  (9), used at 4 mg/kg dose, also significantly decreased the concentrations of TC (32%, 33% and 64%, respectively) and TGs (48%, 33% and 93%, respectively).

This proposal is supported by the observation that South Asian Indians have lower plasma and tissue concentrations of GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA, the precursors of PGE₁, PGI₂, PGI₃, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and nitrolipids, the endogenous molecules that prevent platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction, thrombus formation, leukocyte activation and possess anti-inflammatory action and thus, are capable of preventing the development of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and premature ischemic heart disease.

Camelina sativa L. belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is frequently used as a natural vegetable oil source, as its seeds contain a high content of fatty acids. In this study, we observed that, when subjected to heavy metals (Cd, Co, Zn and Pb), the seeds of CsHMA3 (Heavy-Metal P1B-ATPase 3) transgenic lines retained their original golden yellow color and smooth outline, unlike wild-type seeds. Furthermore, we investigated the fatty acids content and composition of wild type and CsHMA3 transgenic lines after heavy metal treatments compared to the control. The results showed higher total fatty  amounts in seeds of CsHMA3 transgenic lines compared with those in wild-type seeds under heavy-metal stresses. In addition, the compositions of unsaturated fatty acids-especially 18:1 (oleic ), 18:2 (linoleic ; only in case of Co treatment), 18:3 () and 20:1 (eicosenoic )-in CsHMA3 overexpressing transgenic lines treated with heavy metals were higher than those of wild-type seeds under the same conditions. Furthermore, reactive  species (ROS) contents in wild-type leaves and roots when treated with heavy metal were higher than in CsHMA3 overexpressing transgenic lines. These results indicate that overexpression of CsHMA3 affects fatty  composition and content-factors that are responsible for the fuel properties of biodiesel-and can alleviate ROS accumulation caused by heavy-metal stresses in Camelina.

Increased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that characterize NASH. Our recent study with n-3 PUFA showed improvement in individual histologic parameters like steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation. We hypothesized that n-3 PUFA therapy mediated improvement in histologic parameters is modulated by lipidomic and proteomic changes.We therefore evaluated hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic profiles before and after n-3 PUFA therapy in subjects with NASH. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with NASH received 6-month treatment with n-3 PUFA (0.945 g/day [64%  (ALA), 21% eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and 16% docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids]). Paired liver biopsy and plasma collected before and after-n-3 PUFA therapy were assessed using mass spectrometry and gas chromatography for hepatic proteomics and plasma lipidomics. Data were matched to UniProt and LIPID MAPS database, respectively. Cytoscape software was used to analyze functional pathways. Twenty-seven NASH patients with paired liver histology and plasma before and after n-3 PUFA treatment were studied.Treatment with n-3 PUFA significantly increased ALA, EPA, and glycerophospholipids, and decreased arachidonic  (p < 0.05 for all). Further, proteomic markers of cell matrix, lipid metabolism, ER stress and cellular respiratory pathways were also modulated. Interestingly, these alterations reflected functional changes highly suggestive of decreased cellular lipotoxicity potential; reduced ER proteasome degradation of proteins and induction of chaperones; and a shift in cell energy homeostasis towards mitochondrial beta-oxidation.Six-month treatment with omega-3 PUFAs significantly improved hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic markers of , endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial functions in patients with NASH.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

The COX-catalyzed free radical peroxidation of arachidonic  (ω-6) can produce deleterious metabolites (e.g. 2-series prostaglandins) that are implicated in  development. Thus, COX inhibition has been intensively investigated as a complementary therapeutic strategy for . However, our previous study has demonstrated that a free radical-derived byproduct (8-hydroxyoctanoic ) formed from COX-catalyzed peroxidation of dihomo-γ- (DGLA, the precursor of arachidonic ) can inhibit  cell growth. We thus hypothesize that the commonly overexpressed COX in  (~90% of  patients) can be taken advantage to suppress cell growth by knocking down delta-5-desaturase (D5D, a key enzyme that converts DGLA to arachidonic ). In addition, D5D knockdown along with DGLA supplement may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. After knocking down D5D in HCA-7 colony 29 cells and HT-29 cells (human  cell lines with high and low COX levels, respectively), the antitumor activity of DGLA was significantly enhanced along with the formation of a threshold range (~0.5-1.0μM) of 8-hydroxyoctanoic . In contrast, DGLA treatment did not inhibit cell growth when D5D was not knocked down and only limited amount of 8-hydroxyoctanoic  was formed. D5D knockdown along with DGLA treatment also enhanced the cytotoxicities of various chemotherapeutic drugs, including 5-fluorouracil, regorafenib, and irinotecan, potentially through the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, e.g. p53 and caspase 9. For the first time, we have demonstrated that the overexpressed COX in  cells can be utilized in suppressing  cell growth. This finding may provide a new option besides COX inhibition to optimize  therapy. The outcome of this translational research will guide us to develop a novel ω-6-based diet-care strategy in combination with current chemotherapy for  prevention and treatment.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28095910>Profile of bioactive compounds in Nymphaea alba L. leaves growing in Egypt: hepatoprotective, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity.</a></h2><p>Nymphaea alba L. represents an interesting field of study. Flowers have antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects, rhizomes constituents showed cytotoxic activity against liver cell carcinoma, while several Nymphaea species have been reported for their hepatoprotective effects. Leaves of N. alba have not been studied before. Therefore, in this study, in-depth characterization of the leaf phytoconstituents as well as its antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities have been performed where N. alba leaf extract was evaluated as a possible therapeutic alternative in hepatic disorders.The aqueous ethanolic extract (AEE, 70%) was investigated for its polyphenolic content identified by high-resolution electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (HRESI-MS/MS), while the petroleum ether fraction was saponified, and the lipid profile was analysed using gas liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis and compared with reference standards. The hepatoprotective activity of two doses of the extract (100 and 200 mg/kg; P.O.) for 5 days was evaluated against CCl-induced hepatotoxicity in male Wistar albino rats, in comparison with silymarin. Liver function tests; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and total bilirubin were performed. Oxidative stress parameters; malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as well as inflammatory mediator; tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α were detected in the liver homogenate. Histopathological examination of the liver and immunohistochemical staining of caspase-3 were performed RESULTS: Fifty-three compounds were tentatively identified for the first time in N.alba leaf extract, where ellagitannins represent the main identified constituents. Nine hydrocarbons, two sterols and eleven fatty acids were identified in the petroleum ether extract where, palmitic  and  acids represented the major saturated and unsaturated fatty  respectively. N.alba AEE significantly improved the liver function, oxidative stress parameters as well as TNF-α in addition to the amelioration of histopathological features of the liver and a profound decrease in caspase-3 expression.These results shed light on the hepatoprotective effect of N. alba that is comparable with that of silymarin. The antioxidant activities of N. alba extract in addition to the inhibition of crucial inflammatory mediator, as TNF-α, might be the possible hepatoprotective mechanisms.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21178607>Docosahexaenoic : brain accretion and roles in neuroprotection after brain hypoxia and ischemia.</a></h2><p>With important effects on neuronal lipid composition, neurochemical signaling and cerebrovascular pathobiology, docosahexaenoic  (DHA), a n-3 polyunsaturated fatty , may emerge as a neuroprotective agent against cerebrovascular disease. This paper examines pathways for DHA accretion in brain and evidence for possible roles of DHA in prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for cerebrovascular disease.DHA is a major n-3 fatty  in the mammalian central nervous system and enhances synaptic activities in neuronal cells. DHA can be obtained through diet or to a limited extent via conversion from its precursor, α- (α-LNA). DHA attenuates brain necrosis after hypoxic ischemic injury, principally by modulating membrane biophysical properties and maintaining integrity in functions between presynaptic and postsynaptic areas, resulting in better stabilizing intracellular ion balance in hypoxic-ischemic insult. Additionally, DHA alleviates brain apoptosis, by inducing antiapoptotic activities such as decreasing responses to reactive  species, upregulating antiapoptotic protein expression, downregulating apoptotic protein expression, and maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function.DHA in brain relates to a number of efficient delivery and accretion pathways. In animal models DHA renders neuroprotection after hypoxic-ischemic injury by regulating multiple molecular pathways and gene expression.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22753389>Synthesis of monoacylglycerol containing  via stepwise esterification using a cold active lipase.</a></h2><p>High purity monoacylglycerol (MAG) containing  was synthesized via stepwise esterification of glycerol and fatty acids from pine nut oil using a cold active lipase from Penicillium camembertii as a biocatalyst. Effects of temperature, molar ratio, water content, enzyme loading, and vacuum on the synthesis of MAG by lipase-catalyzed esterification of glycerol and fatty acid from pine nut oil were investigated. Diacylglycerol (DAG) as well as MAG increased significantly when temperature was increased from 20 to 40 °C. At a molar ratio of 1:1, MAG content decreased because of the significant increase in DAG content. Water has a profound influence on both MAG and DAG content through the entire course of reaction. The reaction rate increased significantly as enzyme loading increased up to 600 units. Vacuum was an effective method to reduce DAG content. The optimum temperature, molar ratio, water content, enzyme loading, vacuum, and reaction time were 20 °C, 1:5 (fatty acid to glycerol), 2%, 600 units, 5 torr, and 24 h, respectively. MAG content further increased via lipase-catalyzed second step esterification at subzero temperature.

Accordingly, stable nanoemulsion formulation of ESA was engineered with the aid of bitter melon seed oil and non-toxic excipients. Morphology and particle size of the emulsion formulations were studied to validate stability. The real-time rapid uptake of the ESA NE and its increased prophylactic efficacy against induced endogenous and exogenous ROS in terms of cell viability and membrane integrity was evaluated flow-cytometrically and with fluorescence microscopic analysis of different primary cells. It was found that the fabricated non-toxic ESA NE had stable parameters (hydrodynamic mean diameter, particle size distribution and zeta potential) for over 12 weeks. Further, ESA NE at a concentration of ∼ 70 μM exhibited maximum efficacy in protecting cells from oxidative damage against both endogenous and exogenous ROS in lymphocytes and hepatocytes as compared to its corresponding presence in the CE formulation.

Studies have shown that consumption of DAG results in metabolic characteristics that are distinct from those of TAG, which may be beneficial in preventing and managing obesity. The objective of the present study was to investigate if food items in which part of the TAG oil is replaced with DAG oil combined with high α- (ALA) content would influence metabolic markers. A 12-week double-blinded randomised controlled parallel-design study was conducted. The participants (n 23) were healthy, overweight men and women, aged 37-67 years, BMI 27-35 kg/m(2), with waist circumference >94 cm (men) and >88 cm (women). The two groups received 20 g margarine, 11 g mayonnaise and 12 g oil per d, containing either high ALA and sn-1,3-DAG or high ALA and TAG. Substitution of TAG oil with DAG oil in food items for 12 weeks led to an improvement of the predicted 10 years cardiovascular risk score in overweight subjects by non-significantly improving markers of health such as total body fat percentage, trunk fat mass, alanine aminotransferase, systolic blood pressure, γ-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase and total fat-free mass. This may suggest that replacing TAG oil with DAG oil in healthy, overweight individuals may have beneficial metabolic effects.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3586859>Fluorescence formation and heme degradation at different stages of  peroxidation.</a></h2><p>Secondary oxidative products of autoxidized methyl linoleate were divided into three groups (SP-I, SP-II and SP-III), which were then compared as to their abilities to form fluorescent substances and to degrade heme. SP-III showed a marked ability to produce two fluorescent substances exhibiting an excitation maximum at 350-360 nm and an emission maximum at 410-430 nm, while SP-I showed a more strongly degradative effect on heme than SP-III. The heme degradation was observed in parallel with the changes of TBA value in an early stage of  peroxidation and the fluorescence formation markedly increased according to the decrease of TBA value in a later stage.

Here, we extend our study to investigate the effects of delta-5-desaturase-knockdown and the resulting intensified dihomo-γ- peroxidation in xenograft tumor mice model.Four-week old nude mice bearing the human  cell HCA-7/C29 vs. its delta-5-desaturase knockdown analog (via shRNA transfection) were subject to 4-week treatments of: vehicle control, dihomo-γ- supplementation, 5-Fluorouracil, and combination of dihomo-γ- and 5-Fluorouracil. Tumor growth was monitored during the treatment. At the endpoint, the mice were euthanized and the tumor tissues were collected for further mechanism analysis.Delta-5-desaturase knockdown (shRNA) together with dihomo-γ- supplementation increased 8-hydroxyoctanoic  production to a threshold level in xenograft tumors, which consequently induced p53-dependent apoptosis and reduced tumors significantly. The promoted 8-hydroxyoctanoic  formation was also found to suppress the tumors' metastatic potential via regulating MMP-2 and E-cadherin expressions.

Furthermore, RSO inhibited the phosphorylation of upstream mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (c-JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Taken together, the possible mechanisms to increase antioxidant enzyme activities in HepG2 may through the suppression of ERK and JNK phosphorylation.

The use of sources rich in linoleic and α- favors the accumulation of conjugated linoleic acids isomers, increasing the healthy properties of milk. Ruminal microbiota plays a pivotal role in defining milk FA composition, and its profile is affected by diet composition. The aim of this study was to investigate the responses of rumen FA production and microbial structure to hemp or linseed supplementation in diets of dairy goats. Ruminal microbiota composition was determined by 16S amplicon sequencing, whereas FA composition was obtained by gas-chromatography technique. In all, 18 pluriparous Alpine goats fed the same pre-treatment diet for 40±7 days were, then, arranged to three dietary treatments consisting of control, linseed and hemp seeds supplemented diets. Independently from sampling time and diets, bacterial community of ruminal fluid was dominated by Bacteroidetes (about 61.2%) and Firmicutes (24.2%) with a high abundance of Prevotellaceae (41.0%) and Veillonellaceae (9.4%) and a low presence of Ruminococcaceae (5.0%) and Lachnospiraceae (4.3%). Linseed supplementation affected ruminal bacteria population, with a significant reduction of biodiversity; in particular, relative abundance of Prevotella was reduced (-12.0%), whereas that of Succinivibrio and Fibrobacter was increased (+50.0% and +75.0%, respectively). No statistically significant differences were found among the average relative abundance of archaeal genera between each dietary group.

However, EPO contains a very high level of linoleic  which itself can affect lymphocyte functions and it is not clear to what extent the effects of EPO can be attributed to GLA. The current study investigated the effect of two levels of GLA in the rat diet upon immune cell functions; the level of linoleic  was maintained below 30 g/100 g total fatty acids. Weanling rats were fed on high fat (178 g/kg) diets which contained 4.4 g or 10 g GLA/100 g total fatty acids in place of a proportion of linoleic . The total polyunsaturated fatty  content and the n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  ratio of the diet were maintained at 35 g/100 g total fatty acids and 7, respectively. The fatty  compositions of the serum and of spleen leukocytes were markedly influenced by that of the diet, with an increase in the proportions of GLA and dihomo-gamma- when the diets containing GLA were fed; these diets also increased the proportion of arachidonic  in spleen leukocytes. Spleen lymphocyte proliferation in response to concanavalin A was significantly reduced (by 60%) by feeding the diet containing the higher level of GLA, but not by the diet containing the lower level of GLA. Spleen natural killer cell activity and prostaglandin E (PGE) production by spleen leukocytes were not significantly affected by inclusion of GLA in the diet, although there was a tendency towards decreased natural killer cell activity by cells from rats fed the high GLA diet. Thus, this study shows that dietary GLA is capable of altering the fatty  composition of cells of the immune system and of exerting some immunomodulatory effects, but that the level of GLA in the diet must exceed 4.4 g/100 g total fatty acids for these effects to become apparent.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27927977>PPAR mRNA Levels Are Modified by Dietary n-3 Fatty  Restriction and  Restriction in the Brain and Liver of Growing Rats.</a></h2><p>Without dietary sources of n-3 (ω-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), α- (ALA; 18:3n-3) is the precursor for docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3).

Basal levels of alveolar macrophage (m phi) tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production were higher (P < .05) for LC- and MC-fed pigs than for CO- and LO-fed pigs. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated LC and MC m phi s produced more TNF than m phi s from pigs fed CO, LO, and MO diets. Macrophages from pigs receiving the CO and LC diets had higher (P < .05) levels of leucine aminopeptidase than m phi s from the other dietary groups. Lipopolysaccharide did not increase m phi nitrite production over basal levels except in the MO diet group. However, LPS-stimulated m phi s from the CO, MO, and LC dietary groups produced more nitrite than m phi s from MC-fed pigs. Alveolar lymphocytes from pigs receiving the MC diet produced more T cell growth factors than LO and MO m phi s. Alveolar m phi s from the different dietary groups did not differ in their capacity for non-immune-mediated phagocytosis of fluorescent latex beads.

Because of the rapid emergence of H. pylori strains resistant to existing antibiotics, current treatment regimens show a rapid decline of their eradication rates. Clearly, novel antibacterial strategies against H. pylori are urgently needed. Here, we investigated the in vivo therapeutic potential of liposomal  (LipoLLA) for the treatment of H. pylori infection. The LipoLLA formulation with a size of ∼ 100 nm was prone to fusion with bacterial membrane, thereby directly releasing a high dose of  acids into the bacterial membrane. LipoLLA penetrated the mucus layer of mouse stomach, and a significant portion of the administered LipoLLA was retained in the stomach lining up to 24 h after the oral administration. In vivo tests further confirmed that LipoLLA was able to kill H. pylori and reduce bacterial load in the mouse stomach. LipoLLA treatment was also shown to reduce the levels of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, which were otherwise elevated because of the H. pylori infection. Finally, a toxicity test demonstrated excellent biocompatibility of LipoLLA to normal mouse stomach. Collectively, results from this study indicate that LipoLLA is a promising, effective, and safe therapeutic agent for the treatment of H. pylori infection.</p><p>Keyword:['colonization']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26118785>Consumption of polyunsaturated fat improves the saturated fatty -mediated impairment of HDL antioxidant potential.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to compare the effects of diets containing high-fat, high-cholesterol and saturated fatty acids (HFHC-SFA) and HFHC-polyunsaturated fatty acids-containing (HFHC-PUFA) diets on two major antiatherogenic functions of HDL, the HDL antioxidant function and the macrophage-to-feces reverse cholesterol transport.Experiments were carried out in mice fed a low-fat, low-cholesterol (LFLC) diet, an HFHC-SFA diet or an HFHC-PUFA diet in which SFAs were partly replaced with an alternative high-linoleic and α- fat source. The HFHC-SFA caused a significant increase in serum HDL cholesterol and phospholipids as well as elevated levels of oxidized HDL and oxidized LDL. Replacing SFA with PUFA significantly reduced the levels of these oxidized lipoproteins and enhanced the ability of HDL to protect LDL from oxidation. The SFA-mediated impairment of HDL antioxidant potential was not associated with the cholesterol content of the diet,  or insulin resistance. In contrast, the effect of the HFHC diets on fecal macrophage-derived cholesterol excretion was independent of the fatty  source.SFA intake impairs the antioxidant potential of HDL and increases serum levels of oxidized lipoprotein species whereas the antioxidant potential of HDL is enhanced after PUFA consumption.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Several members have been identified to be regulators for plants response to abscisic  (ABA) signaling. Here, we isolated a subgroup I CDPK gene, ZmCPK4, from maize. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the ZmCPK4 transcripts were induced by various stresses and signal molecules. Transient and stable expression of the ZmCPK4-GFP fusion proteins revealed ZmCPK4 localized to the membrane. Moreover, overexpression of ZmCPK4 in the transgenic Arabidopsis enhanced ABA sensitivity in seed germination, seedling growth and stomatal movement. The transgenic plants also enhanced drought stress tolerance. Taken together, the results suggest that ZmCPK4 might be involved in ABA-mediated regulation of stomatal closure in response to drought stress.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

To reveal the gene network of oil accumulation and fatty  composition in developing embryos, embryos at 10, 20 and 30 DPA in cottonseed were sampled and used for transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). In total, 8629, 7891, and 12,555 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the comparison sets of '20 DPA vs 10 DPA', '30 DPA vs 20 DPA', and '30 DPA vs 10 DPA', respectively.

Fructose-fed rats received a diet containing ALA alone (F-ALA group) or ALA plus EPA and DHA (F-LC3 group) or no (n-3) PUFA (F-N6 group). The 10-wk high-fructose diet (F-N6) induced an insulin-resistant state, as assessed by glucose and insulin tolerance tests. Insulin resistance was linked to a specific FA pattern in insulin-sensitive tissues, which probably involved modifications of Delta9, Delta6, and Delta5-desaturases. This pathological status was related to high cardiovascular risk as assessed by increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and particularly by the increase of pulse pressure, an index of vascular stiffness obtained from telemetry investigations. The (n-3) experimental diets prevented changes in the FA patterns in insulin-sensitive tissues, insulin resistance, and vascular dysfunction.

The aim was to investigate the cross-sectional associations between PAI-1 activity and dietary nutrient intake, focusing on fat quality, in a population-based study of 871 men aged 70 years. The relationship between PAI-1 and the fatty  composition in serum cholesterol esters (n=381 men) was also studied. The estimated total fat intake was positively associated with PAI-1 activity. The intake of both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids was positively associated with PAI-1 activity, whereas the intake of saturated fatty acids was not. In serum cholesterol esters, higher proportions of palmitoleic and dihomo-gamma-, a lower proportion of linoleic , and reduced estimated Delta5-desaturase activity were associated with higher PAI-1 levels. These associations were confounded by factors representing the insulin resistance . PAI-1 activity was positively associated with gamma- and arachidonic , independent of potential confounders. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that dietary intake of unsaturated fatty acids is positively associated with PAI-1 activity, whereas intake of saturated fatty acids is not.

However, the production of CFAs is generally difficult. Several challenges are the low CFAs content in natural sources, the difficulty to chemically synthesize target CFA isomers in high purity, and the sensitive characteristics of CFAs. In this article, the current technologies to produce CFAs, including physical, chemical, and biotechnical approaches were summarized, with a focus on the conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) and conjugated  acids (CLNAs) which are the most common investigated CFAs. CFAs usually demonstrate stronger physiological effects than other non-conjugated fatty acids; however, they are more sensitive to heat and oxidation. Consequently, the quality control throughout the entire production process of CFAs is significant. Special attention was given to the micro- or nano-encapsulation which presented as an emerging technique to improve the bioavailability and storage stability of CFAs. The current applications of CFAs and the potential research directions were also discussed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Aldehydes are therefore potential non-invasive biomarkers of oxidative stress and of various diseases in which oxidative stress is thought to play a role including cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

However, the role of LP during aging has been put in doubt along with the participation of electron leak at the electron transport chain (ETC) in ROS generation in aged organisms. Thus, to test these hypothesis and gain further information about how minimizing LP preserves ETC function during aging, we studied the effects of α- (C18:3) on in situ mitochondrial ETC function, ROS production and viability of chronologically aged cells of S. cerevisiae, whose membranes are intrinsically resistant to LP due to the lack of PUFA. Increased sensitivity to LP was observed in cells cultured with C18:3 at 6 days of aging. This was associated with higher viability loss, dissipated membrane potential, impaired respiration and increased ROS generation, being these effects more evident at 28 days. However, at this point, lower sensitivity to LP was observed without changes in the membrane content of C18:3, suggesting the activation of a mechanism counteracting LP. The cells without C18:3 display better viability and mitochondrial functionality with lower ROS generation even at 28 days of aging and this was attributed to full preservation of complex III activity. These results indicate that the presence of PUFA in membranes enhances ETC dysfunction and electron leak and suggest that complex III is crucial to preserve membrane potential and to maintain a low rate of ROS production during aging.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22199234>Role of 9-lipoxygenase and α-dioxygenase oxylipin pathways as modulators of local and systemic defense.</a></h2><p>Plant 9-lipoxygenases (9-LOX) and α-dioxygenases (α-DOX) initiate the synthesis of oxylipins after bacterial infection. Here, the role of these enzymes in plants' defense was investigated using individual Arabidopsis thaliana lox1 and dox1 mutants and a double lox1 dox1 mutant. Studies with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) revealed the enhanced susceptibility of lox1 to the virulent strain Pst DC3000 and the partial impairment of lox1 and dox1 mutants to activate systemic acquired resistance. Notably, both defects were enhanced in the lox1 dox1 plants as compared with individual mutants. We found that pre-treatment with 9-LOX- and α-DOX-generated oxylipins protected plant tissues against bacterial infection. The strongest effect in this respect was exerted by 9-ketooctadecatrienoic  (9-KOT), which is produced from  by 9-LOX. Quantification of 9-KOT revealed its accumulation after bacterial infection. The levels were reduced in lox1 and lox1 dox1 plants but strongly increased in the dox1 mutant due to metabolic interaction of the two pathways. Transcriptional analyses indicated that 9-KOT pre-treatment modifies hormone homeostasis during bacterial infection. The nature of the changes detected suggested that 9-KOT interferes with the hormonal changes caused by bacterial effectors. This notion was substantiated by the finding that 9-KOT failed to reduce the growth of PstDC3000hrpA, a mutant compromised in effector secretion, and of the avirulent strain Pst DC3000 avrRpm1. Further support for the action of the 9-LOX- and α-DOX-oxylipin pathways as modulators of hormone homeostasis was the observation that lox1 dox1 seedlings are hypersensitive to the growth-inhibitory effect of ABA and showed enhanced activation of ABA-inducible marker genes as compared with wild-type plants.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28124089>Evening primrose oil or forskolin ameliorates celecoxib-enhanced upregulation of tissue factor expression in mice subjected to lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia.</a></h2><p>Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, produces thrombotic events in patients predisposed to cardiovascular risk factors.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses of skin and kernel non-polar extracts (SNP and KNP, respectively) indicated that the major components are fatty acids (696.36 and 879.70 mg g), phytosterols (16.08 and 4.28 mg g), and γ-tocopherol (304.17 and 397.10 μg g). Analysis of the skin and kernel polar extracts (SP and KP, respectively) showed that skin accumulated higher levels of phenolic compounds, especially flavan-3-ols, compared to the kernel. An (epi)catechin hexoside was the major component in SP and KP (9.8 mg g and 3.3 mg g, respectively). Flavan-3-ols with different degrees of polymerization were detected in SP, but only the monomers were identified in the KP. Quercetin glycosides were the major flavonols present in both SP and KP. Bioassays with 3T3L1 mouse adipocytes demonstrated that all extracts decreased lipid accumulation, with SNP demonstrating the highest activity (17% inhibition). Bioassay guided fractionation of SNP indicated that the lipolytic activity was highest in the fraction consisting of linoleic  (20%),  (10%), and β-sitosterol (50%). Radical scavenging assays indicated that all pistachio extracts significantly inhibited ROS, while SP was the most inhibiting to NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Gene expression profiles associated with inflammation (IL6, iNOS, and COX2) were characterized in the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages after treatment with pistachio extracts.

Consequently, ndg-4 mutants lay eggs with a pale appearance due to lack of yolk, and they are resistant to sterility caused by dietary supplementation with the long-chain omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  dihommogamma- (DGLA). Two other proteins, NRF-5 and NRF-6, a homolog of a mammalian secreted lipid binding protein and a NDG-4 homolog, respectively, have previously been shown to function in the same lipid transport pathway. Here, we report that mutation of the NDG-4 protein results in increased organismal stress  and lifespan. When NDG-4 function and /IGF-1 signaling are reduced simultaneously, maximum lifespan is increased almost fivefold. Thus, longevity conferred by mutation of ndg-4 is partially overlapping with  signaling. The nuclear hormone receptor NHR-80 (HNF4 homolog) is required for longevity in germline less animals. We find that NHR-80 is also required for longevity of ndg-4 mutants. Moreover, we find that nrf-5 and nrf-6 mutants also have extended lifespan and increased stress , suggesting that altered lipid transport and metabolism play key roles in determining lifespan.© 2013 The Authors.

In this report, we define the molecular and metabolic basis of Elovl5 control of FoxO1 phosphorylation. Adenoviral-mediated (Ad-Elovl5) induction of hepatic Elovl5 in diet-induced obese, glucose-intolerant mice and HepG2 cells increased the phosphorylation of Akt2-S(473) [mammalian target of rapamycin complex-2 (mTORC2) site], but not Akt2-T(308) (PDK1 site). The Akt2 inhibitor Akti1/2 blocked Elovl5 induction of FoxO1-S(256) phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. Elevated Elovl5 activity in liver and HepG2 cells induced rictor mRNA, rictor protein, and rictor-mTOR interaction, whereas rictor knockdown (siRNA) attenuated Elovl5 induction of Akt2-S(473) and FoxO1-S(256) phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. FA analysis revealed that the abundance of cis-vaccenic  (18:1,n-7) was increased in livers of obese mice and HepG2 cells following Ad-Elovl5 infection. Treating HepG2 cells with Elovl5 substrates established that palmitoleic  (16:1,n-7), but not γ- (18:3,n-6), induced rictor protein, Akt-S(473), and FoxO1-S(256) phosphorylation. Inhibition of FA elongation blocked 16:1,n-7 but not 18:1,n-7 induction of rictor protein and Akt-S(473) and FoxO1-S(256) phosphorylation.

We investigated the effect of 16 different C 18 fatty  isomers on the expression of 84 -related miRNAs in the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 by using a qRT-PCR array. 66 of these 84 miRNAs were deregulated by at least one fatty , however, there was no trans-specific impact on miRNA expression as the corresponding cis isomer of a given fatty  generally had comparable effects on the miRNA expression profile. The most pronounced effects were observed for hsa-miR-146a-5p, which was upregulated by four of the 16 investigated fatty acids, and hsa-miR-32-5p, which was strongly downregulated by five fatty acids. As hsa-miR-32-5p was described to target genes being involved in the regulation of apoptosis, the effect of α-eleostearic  on the expression of the apoptosis-associated genes BCL2L11, BCL-2, and BCL-XL was examined.

Current screening research works are generally based on direct analytical determination of production capacity (e.g., trial and error), representing an important bottleneck in these studies. This review aims to summarize the available information regarding identified genes and proteins involved in CLA/CLNA production by these groups of bacteria and, consequently, the possible enzymatic reactions behind such metabolic processes. Linoleate isomerase (LAI) was the first enzyme to be described to be involved in the microbiological transformation of linoleic acids (LAs) and  acids (LNAs) into CFA isomers. Thus, the availability of  gene sequences has allowed the development of genetic screening tools. Nevertheless, several studies have reported that LAIs have significant homology with myosin-cross-reactive antigen (MCRA) proteins, which are involved in the synthesis of hydroxy fatty acids, as shown by hydratase activity. Furthermore, it has been suggested that CLA and/or CLNA production results from a stress response performed by the activation of more than one gene in a multiple-step reaction. Studies on CFA biochemical pathways are essential to understand and characterize the metabolic mechanism behind this process, unraveling all the gene products that may be involved.

The mechanisms by which n-3 PUFA regulate biological processes begins with an understanding of the n-3 biosynthetic pathway that starts with  (18:3n-3) and is commonly thought to end with the production of docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3). However, our understanding of this pathway is not as complete as previously believed. In the current review we provide a background of the evidence supporting the pathway as currently understood and provide updates from recent studies challenging three central dogma of n-3 PUFA . By building on nearly three decades of research primarily in cell culture and oral dosing studies, recent evidence presented focuses on in vivo kinetic modelling and compound-specific isotope abundance studies in rodents and humans that have been instrumental in expanding our knowledge of the pathway. Specifically, we highlight three main updates to the n-3 PUFA biosynthesis pathway: (1) DHA synthesis rates cannot be as low as previously believed, (2) DHA is both a product and a precursor to tetracosahexaenoic  (24:6n-3) and (3) increases in EPA in response to DHA supplementation are not the result of increased retroconversion.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

While GLVs have been implicated as defense compounds in plants, GLVs give characteristic grassy note to a bouquet of aroma in green tea, which is manufactured from young leaves of Camellia sinensis. Here we identify three HPL-related genes from C. sinensis via RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) in silico, and functionally characterized a candidate gene, CYP74B24, as a gene encoding tea HPL. Recombinant CYP74B24 protein heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli specifically produced (Z)-3-hexenal from 13-HPOT with the optimal pH 6.0 in vitro. CYP74B24 gene was expressed throughout the aerial organs in a rather constitutive manner and further induced by mechanical wounding. Constitutive expression of CYP74B24 gene in intact tea leaves might account for low but substantial and constitutive formation of a subset of GLVs, some of which are stored as glycosides. Our results not only provide novel insights into the biological roles that GLVs play in tea plants, but also serve as basis for the improvement of aroma quality in tea manufacturing processes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Patients with PsA were entered in a double-blind placebo controlled study and received either 12 Efamol Marine capsules or 12 placebo capsules daily for 9 months. All patients received placebo capsules for a further 3 months. At month 3 of the study patients were asked to reduce their intake of NSAIDs and maintain that decrease provided there was no worsening of their joint symptoms. Clinical assessments of skin and joint disease severity and activity were performed at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. All measures of skin disease activity including severity, percentage body affected and itch were unchanged by Efamol Marine. The NSAID requirement remained the same between both treatment groups. In addition, there was no change demonstrated in the activity of arthritis as measured by duration of morning stiffness. Ritchie articular index, number of active joints, ESR and CRP. However, a rise in serum TXB2 was observed in the active group during the placebo phase; in addition a fall in leukotriene B4 production occurred during the active phase period followed by a marked rise during the placebo phase suggesting some laboratory documented anti-inflammatory effect.

The concentrations of palmitoleic, docosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic, dihomo-γ-, arachidonic, and docosatetraenoic acids were higher in epididymal adipose tissue than in mesenteric and subcutaneous adipose tissues; but no significant differences were detected between mesenteric and subcutaneous tissues in the normal group or among all the sites in the HFF rats. In the HFF group, stearic and oleic  concentrations were higher, whereas n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated ones were lower, than those in the normal group.

These results at least in part suggest that the properties of adipose tissue are difficult to distinguish based only on their "visceral" or "subcutaneous" sites. In addition, the absence of site dependence and/or difference in balance among saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids may play an important role in the development of insulin resistance in the HFF rats.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Since PUFA n-3 consumption has been shown to be inversely correlated with coronary heart diseases (CHD) incidence, clinical trials have been principally conducted by administering fish oil supplements or purified PUFA n-3. The relationship between dietary PUFA n-3 and CHD is believed to be only partially mediated by their effects on plasma lipoprotein profile. PUFA n-3 have shown to reduce only slightly total and LDL cholesterol, probably as they crowd saturated fatty acids out of diet. Data on HDL cholesterol suggest that PUFA n-3 produce only a small increase in this fraction. The effect of PUFA n-3 supplementation on plasma triglycerides (TG) is much more important, with a reduction of about 25% in normolipidemic subjects and about 50% in hypertriglyceridemic patients. This effect seems to be mediated by an inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase, and VLDL secretion, and an increase in apo B liver degradation. They also increase lipoprotein lipase activity resulting in a reduction of post-prandial TG. PUFA n-3 might be used as second line therapy, additional or alternative to fibrates and nicotinic , in the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia.

During a 63-day period, two homogeneous groups of eight lactating Brown cows were allocated to either housing (H) in a free-stall building for 24 h/day. Feeding was based on a total mixed ration or grazing (G) on barley grass for 5 h/day, and housing in a free-stall structure with feeding was based on the same total mixed ration offered to the H group. With regard to behaviour, H cows spent more time idling, walking, drinking, and self-grooming, whereas G cows showed a greater intent to eat and interact socially. Moreover, G cows exhibited slightly higher reactive  metabolites and similar biological antioxidant potential concentrations than the H group, which indicates that short grazing resulted in an almost negligible increase in oxidative stress and an unchanged antioxidant capacity. Skin tests, performed by injecting phytohemoagglutinin intradermally, indicated that G cows had thicker skin than H cows at the end of the trial, an index of a better cell-mediated immune response. Grazing did not affect milk yield but improved milk quality in terms of an increase in fat and a reduction in urea content, somatic cell count, and total microbial count. Milk from G cows was richer in saturated fatty acids, likely because of the contribution of palmitic  present in the grazed barley grass, and also showed higher contents of some healthy fatty acids, such as rumenic  and α-, and a lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio. These results show that including a short grazing time in the diets of organic dairy cows does not have negative consequences for milk production and contributes to improved milk quality as well as to a more efficient immune response in the cows.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27993180>Intake of n-3 fatty acids and long-term outcome in renal transplant recipients: a post hoc analysis of a prospective cohort study.</a></h2><p>Supplementation with n-3 fatty acids may improve long-term outcomes of renal transplant recipients (RTR).

Health status of participants-volunteers and the hypoxia intensity were monitored with a complex of electrophysiological methods: EEC, ECG, measurement of blood pressure, SpO2, evaluation of cardiac output, gas analysis of exhaled air. Using gas chromatography we studied plasma fatty acids total profile (esterificated and non-esterificated) before hypoxia exposure, on 2nd, 5th, 10th, 20th minutes of acute hypoxia and on 5th and 15th minutes of recovery. It was shown that blood saturation value dropped to 52.1 +/- 7.1 % on 25th minute of hypoxia exposure. There were no statistically significant changes in concentrations of total fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated palmitoleic , polyunsaturated linoleic and  acids. Significant (p < 0.05) decrease of concentration of oleic and arachidonic acids was displayed that persisted after 15 minutes of recovery period. It is possible to assume that these changes in unsaturated fatty  concentration were caused by activation of free radical oxidation processes and production of oleic  derivatives.

A unique ordered pattern and classification of FAMEs is obtained in a 2D GC x FI-MS separation plot based on the number of carbons, the degree of unsaturation, and a combination of both by which the geometrical, positional, and structural isomers group together. FAMEs with different chain length but identical geometry, position, and degree of unsaturation follow linear patterns.

Non-FAMEs and FAMEs with different functional groups are identified using the ordered separation pattern of the FAMEs in the GC x FI-MS plot and the exact mass data from the FI-MS mode. Measurement of exact mass also acts as a high-resolution separation technique to separate overlapping peaks.

In leaves, seeds, and husks, about 76, 78, 58% polyunsaturated, 21, 15, 20% saturated, and 3, 7, 22% monounsaturated fatty acids were found, respectively. A range of FAs (C12 to C24) was detected in psyllium and among different plant parts, a high content of the nutritive indicators ω-3  CPS (57%) and ω-6 linoleic  CPS (18%) was detected in leaves. Similarly, total content of phenolics and the essential amino  valine were also detected utmost in leaves followed by sulfur-rich amino acids and flavonoids. In total, 36 different metabolites were identified in psyllium, out of which 26 (13 each) metabolites were detected in leaves and seeds, whereas the remaining 10 were found in the husk. Most of the metabolites are natural antioxidants, phenolics, flavonoids, or alkaloids and can be used as nutrient supplements. Moreover, these metabolites have been reported to have several pharmaceutical applications, including anti-cancer activity. Natural plant ROS scavengers, saponins, were also detected.

The role of different fatty  families in modulating phagocytosis and oxidative burst is not clear and therefore the influence of 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on these processes was examined. The mouse monocyte/macrophage line P388D1 was cultured in medium supplemented with 2 or 20 micromol/l 18:2n-6 (linoleic ; LA) or 18:3n-3 (; LNA) and fatty  enrichment of the cells was tested after 8 days. The macrophages were activated with phorbol ester in order to promote oxidative burst and intracellular dihydrorhodamine oxidation was determined. To test phagocytosis capacity uptake of fluorescence-labeled Escherichia coli was determined. Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB was also determined. Cells grown in medium with 20 micromol/l LA contained 2- to 3-fold more n-6 PUFA including 4-fold more arachidonic . Cells grown in medium with 20 micromol/l LNA contained 4-fold more n-3 PUFA. Both LA and LNA enhanced phagocytosis and decreased oxidative burst, with little difference between the fatty acids. NF-kappaB activation at 1 h post-stimulation was not affected by adding LA or LNA to the culture medium.

Activation of GPR120 promotes the secretion of incretin GLP-1, which is known to have effects on anti-. As such, GPR120 is a potential target of pharmaceuticals for type II diabetes. In this study, we performed ligand-screening for GPR120 on glycero- and sphingo-type lipids and their derivatives using a Transforming Growth Factor α-shedding assay. We found that phytosphingosine (PHS) activates GPR120 in a manner comparable to the natural ligand α- (ALA) and superior to that of the synthetic ligand GW9508. The IC50 value of PHS was 33.4 μM, of ALA was 31.0 μM and of GW9508 was 41.7 μM. Additionally, PHS-induced activation of GPR120 was inhibited by the specific antagonist AH7614. Many of the natural or synthetic ligands found thus far are compounds with carboxyl groups. However, PHS does not possess a carboxyl group, suggesting that its manner of interaction with GPR120 may be significantly different from that of other ligands.

Foc is a soil borne pathogen that causes rot of the roots or wilt of leaves by colonizing the xylem vessels. The dual RNA sequencing is used to simultaneously assess the transcriptomes of pathogen and host. This method greatly helps to understand the responses of pathogen and host to each other and discover the potential pathogenic mechanism.Plantlets of two economically important banana cultivars, Foc TR4 less susceptible cultivar NK and susceptible cultivar BX, were used to research the Foc-banana interaction mechanism. Notably, the infected NK had more significantly up-regulated genes on the respiration machinery including TCA cycle, glyoxylate, glycerol, and glycolysis compared to BX at 27 h post inoculation (hpi). In addition, genes involved in plant-pathogen interaction, starch, sucrose,  and sphingolipid metabolisms were uniquely more greatly induced in BX than those in NK during the whole infection. Genes related to the biosynthesis and metabolism of SA and JA were greatly induced in the infected NK; while auxin and abscisic  metabolisms related genes were strongly stimulated in the infected BX at 27 hpi. Furthermore, most of fungal genes were more highly expressed in the roots of BX than in those of NK. The fungal genes related to pathogenicity, pectin and chitin metabolism, reactive  scavenging played the important roles during the infection of Foc. CCP1 (cytochrome c peroxidase 1) was verified to involve in cellulose utilization, oxidative stress response and pathogenicity of fungus.The transcriptome indicated that NK had much faster defense response against Foc TR4 than BX and the expression levels of fungal genes were higher in BX than those in NK. The metabolisms of carbon, nitrogen, and signal transduction molecular were differentially involved in pathogen infection in BX and NK.

Compared to plants grown under normal conditions, the height and root length of wild type (WT) were reduced by approximately 40 and 29% following exposure to salt stress for 3 weeks, whereas Till-II-877 line showed 29 and 23% reductions in plant height and root length, respectively. No significant changes were observed in total chlorophyll content, and the malondialdehyde content of the mutant increased less than that of the WT under salt treatment. Gene expression was compared between the WT and mutant lines using microarray analysis. An unbiased analysis of the gene expression datasets allowed us to identify the pathways involved in salt-stress responses. Among the most significantly affected pathways, changes in gene expression were observed in α- and linoleic  metabolism (in lipid metabolism), fructose and mannose metabolism and glycolysis-gluconeogenesis (in carbohydrate metabolism), cysteine and methionine metabolism (in amino  metabolism), and carbon fixation (in the  metabolism of photosynthetic organisms) under salt stress.

It has been commonly accepted that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) is one of the most important targets for ameliorating abnormalities of lipid metabolism. Therefore, we focused on the activation of PPARα and attempted to detect active compounds activating PPARα in tomato.To identify such active compounds, we screened fractions of tomato extracts using PPARα luciferase reporter assay. One fraction, rechromatographed-fraction eluted in 57 min (RF57), significantly increased PPARα reporter activity, in which a single compound is detected by LC/MS analysis. On the basis of LC/MS and NMR analyses, we determined the chemical structure of the active compound in RF57 as 9-oxo-10(E),12(E)-octadecadienoic  (9-oxo-ODA).

The comparison of tests results of patients with ischemic heart disease and volunteers].</a></h2><p>According to the generally accepted theory, the atherosclerosis is a kind of disorder of metabolism of lipids which chemically are the ethers of fatty lipids with spirits. Hence, the atherosclerosis is fatty acids pathology. In conformity with the biologic classification, among fatty acids it is functionally valid to distinguish saturated fatty acids without double bonds; monoenic fatty acids with one double bond; unsaturated fatty acids with two or three double bonds and polyenic fatty acids with four of six double bonds in chain. The saturated and monenic fatty acids are the substrates for cells to groundwork energy, ATP The unsaturated fatty acids in vivo are needed to form membranes. The polyenic fatty acids are essential since they are precursors of cell synthesis of humoral regulators--eicosanoids (prostanoids and leukotrienes). To clarify the pathogenesis of the " pandemics" most prevalent in human population, the quantitative determination of individual fatty acids in blood plasma and erythrocytes using gas chromatography technique is needed. It is necessary to evaluate the content of medium chain fatty acids; palmitic and stearic saturated fatty acids; oleic monoenic fatty  and its transforms--linoleic,  and dihomo-gamma- unsaturated fatty acids; essential polyenic omega-6 arachidonic, omega-3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids. The higher is in food the content of palmitic saturated fatty , palmitoleic and trans-vaccenic monoenic fatty acids, the more is in patient diet of beef meat and products of fat cow's milk. The higher is ratio of palmitic/oleic fatty acids the lower is the risk of formation of atheromatosis of arteries intima and development of ischemic heart disease and vice versa. The decrease of ratio of omega-3/omega-6 essential polyenic fatty acids is undesirable in prognostic sense. The metabolism of these acids differs and functional activity of omega-3 eicosanoid type 3 is higher In case of deficiency of omega-3 and omega-6 polyenic fatty acids in cells eicosanoids are synthesized from unsaturated dihomogamma- fatty  and their influence turns out to be aphysiologic. This condition is a pathogenic foundation of atherosclerosis. There is a diagnostic reason to detect fatty acids in case of diabetes mellitus, obesity,  and partially arterial hypertension.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28679464>Linoleic (LA) and  (ALA)  concentrations in follicular fluid of prepubertal goats and their effect on oocyte in vitro maturation and embryo development.</a></h2><p>In this study we assessed the concentration of linoleic  (LA) and  (ALA) in follicular fluid of prepubertal goats according to follicle size (<3mm or ≥3mm) by gas chromatography and tested the addition of different LA and ALA (LA:ALA) concentration ratios (50:50, 100:50 and 200:50µM) to the IVM medium on embryo development, mitochondrial activity, ATP concentration and relative gene expression (RPL19, ribosomal protein L19; SLC2A1, facilitated glucose transporter 1; ATF4, activating transcription factor 4; GPX1, glutathione peroxidase 1; HSPA5, heat-shock protein family A 70 kDa; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; DNMT1, DNA methyltransferase 1; GCLC, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit; SOD1, superoxide dismutase 1). Oocytes were in vitro matured, fertilised or parthenogenetically activated and zygotes were cultured following conventional protocols. LA concentration ranged from 247 to 319µM and ALA concentration from 8.39 to 41.19µM without any effect of follicle size. Blastocyst production from the different groups was: control FCS (22.33%) and BSA (19.63%), treatments 50:50 (22.58%), 100:50 (21.01%) and 200:50 (9.60%). Oocytes from the 200:50 group presented higher polyspermy and mitochondrial activity compared with controls and the rest of the treatment groups.

Eighteen participants (>50 y old) with elevated cholesterol concentrations (3.37-4.14 mmol/L LDL cholesterol) consumed 5 experimental diets in random order for periods of 35 d. Each diet contained 30% of energy as fat, two-thirds of which was high-oleic  soybean oil (HiOleic-SO), soybean oil (SO), low-SFA soybean oil (LoSFA-SO), hydrogenated soybean oil (Hydrog-SO), or low-ALA soybean oil (LoALA-SO), resulting in LA:ALA ratios of 2.98, 8.70, 9.69, 15.2, and 18.3, respectively. Participants had higher proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) compared with baseline following consumption of SO (26%; P < 0.05), LoSFA-SO (22%; P < 0.05), or HiOleic-SO (24%; P < 0.05) diets.

A two-way analysis of variance was then applied to assess the effects of diet and oil and the interaction between them.After 8 weeks, the obesogenic dietary regimen increased the body weight, altered the plasma lipid profile and increased the liver fat content and the plasma transaminase activities. In addition, the obesogenic diet decreased bacterial glycolytic activity and short-chain fatty  formation in the distal intestine. Dietary blackcurrant seed oil improved the lipid metabolism by lowering liver fat accumulation and the plasma triglyceride concentration and atherogenicity as well by increasing the plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration. However, in rats fed an obesogenic diet containing blackcurrant seed oil, the plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration was comparable with both rapeseed oil-containing diets, and a significant elevation of the plasma transaminase activities was noted instead.The obesogenic dietary regimen causes a number of metabolic disorders, including alterations in the hindgut microbial metabolism.

Nowadays, the search for food components able to improve fish health is increasingly developing. Here, the influence of four dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that are  (ALA, 18:3n-3), linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3) on the sensitivity of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) juveniles to environmentally realistic cadmium (Cd, 0.3 μg/L) concentration was investigated. Fish diets were designed to ensure the specific abundance of one of these individual PUFAs, and were given for a 4-week pre-conditioning period followed by a 6-week Cd exposure period. Focus was put on growth performance and immune responses following a short (24 h) and a long-term (6 weeks) Cd exposure. For each experimental condition, some fish were submitted to a bacterial challenge (24 h) with Aeromonas salmonicida achromogenes at the end of Cd conditioning period. DHA-enriched diet improved growth performances as compared to LA-enriched diet, but also increased ROS production (after short-term exposure to Cd) that could lead to a higher inflammation status, and some immunity-related genes (at short and long-term exposure). We notably highlighted the fact that even a low, environmentally-realistic concentration, Cd can strongly impact the immune system of rainbow trout, and that specific dietary PUFA enrichment strategies can improve growth performance (DHA-enriched diet), provide protection against oxidative stress (ALA- and EPA-enriched diet) and stimulate non-specific immunity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve these goals two sets of experiments were designed: (i) to study the prevention of onset of dyslipidaemia and IR in Wistar rats fed during 3 weeks with a SRD in which chia seed was the dietary source of fat; (ii) to analyse the effectiveness of chia seed in improving or reversing the metabolic abnormalities described above. Rats were fed a SRD during 3 months; by the end of this period, stable dyslipidaemia and IR were present in the animals. From months 3-5, half the animals continued with the SRD and the other half were fed a SRD in which the source of fat was substituted by chia seed (SRD+chia). The control group received a diet in which sucrose was replaced by maize starch. The results showed that: (i) dietary chia seed prevented the onset of dyslipidaemia and IR in the rats fed the SRD for 3 weeks--glycaemia did not change; (ii) dyslipidaemia and IR in the long-term SRD-fed rats were normalised without changes in insulinaemia when chia seed provided the dietary fat during the last 2 months of the feeding period. Dietary chia seed reduced the visceral adiposity present in the SRD rats.

However, this molecule is naturally found in plants such as flaxseed and canola which currently limits production. Here, we demonstrate the potential to sustainably produce ALA using the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. Through the use of a recently identified Δ12-15 desaturase (Rk Δ12-15), we were able to enable production in Y. lipolytica. When combined with a previously engineered -overproducing strain with high precursor availability, further improvements of ALA production were achieved. Finally, the cultivation of this strain at lower temperatures significantly increased ALA content, with cells fermented at 20 °C accumulating nearly 30% ALA of the total lipids in this cell. This low-temperature fermentation represents improved ALA titer up to 3.2-fold compared to standard growth conditions.

Therefore, innate  is a pharmaceutical target for the development of immune regulators. Here, for the purpose of pharmaceutical screening, we established an in vitro culture based on the innate immune response of Drosophila. The in vitro system is capable of measuring lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent activation of the immune deficiency (imd) pathway, which is similar to the tumour necrosis factor signalling pathway in mammals. Screening revealed that well-known inhibitors of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), dexamethasone (Dex) and p-bromophenacyl bromide (BPB) inhibit LPS-dependent activation of the imd pathway. The inhibitory effects of Dex and BPB were suppressed by the addition of an excess of three (arachidonic , eicosapentaenoic  and gamma-) of the fatty acids so far tested. Arachidonic , however, did not activate the imd pathway when used as the sole agonist. These findings indicate that PLA(2) participates in LPS-dependent activation of the imd pathway via the generation of arachidonic  and other mediators, but requires additional signalling from LPS stimulation. Moreover, PLA(2) was activated in response to bacterial infection in Sarcophaga.

The influence of lipids on the immune response is both complex and diverse, with multiple studies pointing to the beneficial effects of long-chain fatty acids in . However, the mechanisms through which PUFAs modulate innate  and the effects of PUFA deficiencies on innate immune functions remain to be clarified. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans-Pseudomonas aeruginosa host-pathogen system, we present genetic evidence that a Delta6-desaturase FAT-3, through its two 18-carbon products--gamma- (GLA, 18:3n6) and stearidonic  (SDA, 18:4n3), but not the 20-carbon PUFAs arachidonic  (AA, 20:4n6) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n3)--is required for basal innate  in vivo. Deficiencies in GLA and SDA result in increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, which is associated with reduced basal expression of a number of immune-specific genes--including spp-1, lys-7, and lys-2--that encode antimicrobial peptides. GLA and SDA are required to maintain basal activity of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, which plays important roles in protecting metazoan animals from infections and oxidative stress. Transcriptional and functional analyses of fat-3-regulated genes revealed that fat-3 is required in the intestine to regulate the expression of infection- and stress-response genes, and that distinct sets of genes are specifically required for immune function and oxidative stress response. Our study thus uncovers a mechanism by which these 18-carbon PUFAs affect basal innate immune function and, consequently, the ability of an organism to defend itself against bacterial infections. The conservation of p38 MAP kinase signaling in both stress and immune responses further encourages exploring the function of GLA and SDA in humans.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521716>Inorganic mesoporous particles for controlled α- delivery to stimulate GLP-1 secretion in vitro.</a></h2><p>Novel treatment methods for  are urgently needed due to the increasing global severity of the problem. Gastrointestinal hormones, such as GLP-1 and PYY, are secreted by the enteroendocrine cells, playing a critical role in regulating food intake. Digested nutrients trigger the secretion of these hormones, which have a very short half-life. α- (αLA) has been shown to stimulate GLP-1 secretion, however, chemical instability and fast uptake in the small intestine hinder its use in body weight management. We developed a novel delivery system based on inorganic mesoporous particles for αLA to increase secretion of gastrointestinal peptides. αLA was loaded to thermally hydrocarbonized porous silicon particles (THCPSi). 47.9 ± 3.84% and 30.7 ± 2.86% of αLA was released during 6 h from 3.0% and 9.2% loading degree (w/w) samples in vitro, respectively.

An accurate prediction of future type 2 diabetes risk in the early postpartum period after GDM would allow for timely interventions to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. In addition, new targets for interventions may be revealed by understanding the underlying pathophysiology of the transition from GDM to type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study is to identify both a predictive signature and early-stage pathophysiology of the transition from GDM to type 2 diabetes.We used a well-characterised prospective cohort of women with a history of GDM pregnancy, all of whom were enrolled at 6-9 weeks postpartum (baseline), were confirmed not to have diabetes via 2 h 75 g OGTT and tested anually for type 2 diabetes on an ongoing basis (2 years of follow-up). A large-scale targeted lipidomic study was implemented to analyse ~1100  metabolites in baseline plasma samples using a nested pair-matched case-control design, with 55 incident cases matched to 85 non-case control participants.

In addition, the underlying pathophysiology was examined in vivo and in vitro.Machine learning optimisation in a decision tree format revealed a seven- metabolite type 2 diabetes predictive signature with a discriminating power (AUC) of 0.92 (87% sensitivity, 93% specificity and 91% accuracy). The signature was highly robust as it includes 45-fold cross-validation under a high confidence threshold (1.0) and binary output, which together minimise the chance of data overfitting and bias selection.

In vitro proliferation of peripheral blood leukocytes after stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA) was higher in chickens with a high level of dietary LNA. Feed intake decreased when the dietary levels of LA or LNA increased. However, BW gain was not affected by dietary treatments. Feed conversion was more efficient in birds fed high levels of LA and LNA. The present study indicates that various factors affect the Ab responses. First, the interaction of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is more important than the separate effects of n-3 or n-6.

Here, this novel research finding is extended to pancreatic  growth, as COX-2 is also commonly overexpressed in pancreatic . The pancreatic  cell line, BxPC-3 (with high COX-2 expression and mutated p53), was used to assess not only the inhibitory effects of the enhanced formation of 8-hydroxyoctanoic  from cellular COX-2-catalyzed DGLA peroxidation but also its potential synergistic and/or additive effect on current chemotherapy drugs. This work demonstrated that, by inducing DNA damage through inhibition of histone deacetylase, a threshold level of 8-hydroxyoctanoic  achieved in DGLA-treated and D5D-knockdown BxPC-3 cells subsequently induce  cell apoptosis. Furthermore, it was shown that a combination of D5D knockdown along with DGLA treatment could also significantly sensitize BxPC-3 cells to various chemotherapy drugs, likely via a p53-independent pathway through downregulating of anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2) and activating pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., caspase 3, -9). This study reinforces the supposition that using commonly overexpressed COX-2 for molecular targeting, a strategy conceptually distinct from the prevailing COX-2 inhibition strategy used in  treatment, is an important as well as viable alternative to inhibit  cell growth. Based on the COX-2 metabolic cascade, the outcomes presented here could guide the development of a novel ω-6-based dietary care strategy in combination with chemotherapy for pancreatic .Copyright © 2016.

In this work, a n-6 PUFAs-producing strain of Aspergillus oryzae was generated by manipulating metabolic reactions in fatty  modification and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. The codon-optimized genes coding for Δ-desaturase and Δ-elongase of Pythium sp., and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (mMaDGAT2) of Mortierella alpina were co-transformed in a single vector into A. oryzae BCC14614, yielding strain TD6E6-DGAT2. Comparative phenotypic analysis showed that a 70% increase of  titer was found in the engineered strain, which was a result of a significant increase in triacylglycerol (TAG) content (52.0 ± 1.8% of total lipids), and corresponded to the increased size of  particles observed in the fungal cells. Interestingly, the proportions of GLA and DGLA in neutral lipids of the engineered strain were similar, with the highest titers obtained in the high C:N culture (29:0; 6% glucose) during the -accumulating stage of growth. Time-course expression analysis of the engineered strain revealed transcriptional control of TAG biosynthesis through a co-operation between the native DGAT2 of A. oryzae and the transformed mMaDGAT2.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we hypothesize that fatty acids analysis in colorectal cancer patients can discriminate between metastatic and non-metastatic patients. Fifty-one consecutive patients with histologically proven colorectal cancer were enrolled in the study and the presence of synchronous metastasis was detected in 25 of these 51 patients. Fatty  profile analysis in red blood cell membranes was not able to discriminate the metastatic colorectal cancer patients from those without metastasis. However, significant differences in the tumor tissue fatty  profile were found in metastatic cancer patients when compared to patients without metastasis. Metastatic patients showed significantly lower percentages of Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and higher levels of γ- (GLA), a -3- and -6-Polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), respectively.

Twenty-eight Holstein cows were blocked for similar calving date 4wk before expected parturition to compare the effects of feeding sources of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on milk production and composition, plasma metabolites, and liver parameters. Cows within each block were assigned to 1 of 3 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets: control with a source of calcium salts of palm oil (MEG; 1.1 and 2.6% of the dry matter in prepartum and postpartum diets, respectively); n-3 fatty acids supplied as whole flaxseed (WFL; 4.8 and 7.7% of the dry matter in prepartum and postpartum diets, respectively); and n-6 fatty acids supplied as whole linola (WLO; 4.8 and 7.7% of the dry matter in prepartum and postpartum diets, respectively). Diets were fed until wk 14 of lactation. Contrasts of WFL versus WLO and polyunsaturated fatty acids versus MEG were compared. Cows fed polyunsaturated fatty acids increased dry matter intake over time at a greater extent than those fed MEG, which resulted in enhanced  balance. Cows fed MEG produced more milk compared with those fed polyunsaturated fatty acids, and there was no difference between those fed WFL and WLO. We found no effect on body condition score and body weight. Plasma concentrations of glucose, fatty acids, and BHB were similar among diets. There was no effect of diet on concentration of glycogen and activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the liver. We observed higher concentrations of hepatic lipids and triacylglycerol in cows fed MEG compared with those fed polyunsaturated fatty acids, and no difference between WFL and WLO. Hepatic catalase activity tended to be higher on wk 4 after calving for cows supplemented with WFL compared with those fed WLO. Feeding linoleic and  acids as unprotected oilseeds increased dry matter intake over time at a greater extent for cows fed MEG, improved the  status, and lowered hepatic lipids and triacylglycerol contents, which may contribute to enhance the health status of transition dairy cows.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Intima-media thickness (IMT) and the plaque score (PS) in carotid arteries were measured. Carotid atherosclerosis was defined as IMT >1.2 mm and/or PS > 5.0. The levels of n-6 PUFAs [dihomo-gamma- (DHLA) and arachidonic  (AA)] and n-3 PUFAs [eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)] were also measured prior to carotid ultra-sound.Carotid atherosclerosis was observed in 94 patients (20.4%). Individual PUFAs levels were comparable between patients with and without carotid atherosclerosis. However, the ratio of EPA/AA and that of n-3/n-6 PUFAs were significantly lower in patients with carotid atherosclerosis compared to those without (median 0.36 vs. 0.41, p = 0.031 and 0.85 vs. 0.93, p = 0.041, respectively]. After adjustment for other confounders, the ratio of EPA/AA (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.12-0.70, p = 0.0055) and the ratio of n-3/n-6 PUFAs (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25-0.80, p = 0.0066) showed an independent reverse association with carotid atherosclerosis. In addition, the area under receiver-operating characteristic curves for carotid atherosclerosis was significantly greater in an established risk model with EPA/AA and n-3/n-6 ratios than in the established risk model alone.These data suggest that low ratios of both EPA/AA ratio and n-3/n-6 PUFAs were closely associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients on HD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Considerable progress has been made in identifying the membrane receptors involved in phagocytosis, but the intracellular signaling pathways that are necessary for particle ingestion are poorly understood. In an effort to address this complex question, we investigated the role of arachidonic  (AA) in the uptake of yeast and IgG-coated E (EIgG) or C-coated E. Human monocytes, labeled with 3H AA, released this label during phagocytosis of yeast and EIgG, but not in response to EC3b. The PL inhibitors bromophenacyl bromide and manoalide abolished the release of 3H and inhibited phagocytosis of EIgG in parallel. Both drugs caused a similar inhibition of yeast-mediated 3H release but had little effect on yeast ingestion. Similar results were obtained with the inhibitor quinacrine (mepacrine). Exogenously added AA and dihomo-gamma- restored bromophenacyl bromide-inhibited EIgG ingestion; arachidonate analogs eicosatrienoic  and eicosapentanoic  did not. Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways for AA metabolism by indomethacin or BW755C did not affect EIgG phagocytosis, demonstrating that these major AA metabolic pathways are not involved in phagocytic signaling.

Lipoxygenase products can be metabolized further in the oxylipin pathway by several groups of CYP74 enzymes. One prominent oxylipin is jasmonic  (JA), a product of the 13-allene oxide synthase branch of the pathway and known as signaling substance that plays a role in vegetative and propagative plant development as well as in plant responses to wounding and pathogen attack. In barley roots, JA level increases upon  by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Apart from this first result regarding JA, no information is available on the relevance of lipidperoxide metabolism in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Thus we analyzed fatty  and lipidperoxide patterns in roots of Medicago truncatula during mycorrhizal . Levels of fungus-specific fatty acids as well as palmitic  (16:0) and oleic  (18:1 n - 9) were increased in mycorrhizal roots. Thus the degree of arbuscular mycorrhizal  of roots can be estimated via analysis of fungal specific esterified fatty acids. Otherwise, no significant changes were found in the profiles of esterified and free fatty acids. The 9- and 13-LOX products of linoleic and  were present in all root samples, but did not show significant differences between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots, except JA which showed elevated levels in mycorrhizal roots. In both types of roots levels of 13-LOX products were higher than those of 9-LOX products. In addition, three cDNAs encoding CYP74 enzymes, two 9/13-hydroperoxide lyases and a 13-allene oxide synthase, were isolated and characterized.

The proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha primes ROS production through phosphorylation of the NADPH-oxidase subunit p47phox on Ser345. Conventional anti-inflammatory therapies remain partially successful and may have side effects. Therefore, regulation of neutrophil activation by natural dietary components represents an alternative therapeutic strategy in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of punicic , a conjugated  fatty  from pomegranate seed oil on TNFalpha-induced neutrophil hyperactivation in vitro and on colon inflammation in vivo.We analyzed the effect of punicic  on TNFalpha-induced neutrophil upregulation of ROS production in vitro and on TNBS-induced rat colon inflammation. Results show that punicic  inhibited TNFalpha-induced priming of ROS production in vitro while preserving formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-induced response. This effect was mediated by the inhibition of Ser345-p47phox phosphorylation and upstream kinase p38MAPK. Punicic  also inhibited fMLP- and TNFalpha+fMLP-induced MPO extracellular release from neutrophils. In vivo experiments showed that punicic  and pomegranate seed oil intake decreased neutrophil-activation and ROS/MPO-mediated tissue damage as measured by F2-isoprostane release and protected rats from TNBS-induced colon inflammation.These data show that punicic  exerts a potent anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of TNFalpha-induced priming of NADPH oxidase by targeting the p38MAPKinase/Ser345-p47phox-axis and MPO release.

Daily milk yield and composition were determined weekly over a 34-day lactation period. Within each litter, one piglet at birth and four piglets on day 35 of life were slaughtered. Milk intake per piglet tended to be greater in trial 2 (832 v. 893 g/day; P=0.066), but piglets grew at 168±3.3 g/day, irrespective of the trial. In the IB sow milk, the linoleic (LA) :  (LNA)  ratio averaged 14.6 and 15.2 in trial 1 and trial 2, respectively. A fivefold increase in piglet body fat content was observed over lactation (P<0.001). Most of this fat (81.4%) was present in the carcass. After 34 days of lactation, whole-body relative content of palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic and oleic acids were very close to those in the milk consumed, suggesting direct deposition. Daily deposition of LA derivatives and of LNA and its derivatives was found to be extremely low (<0.02 g, on average). Moreover, some of the arachidonic  (ARA) in tissues of the IB piglet at birth disappeared throughout the lactating period. An overall fractional deposition for total fatty acids (FA) was 0.409. Fractional oxidation (disappearance) rates were 0.939 and 0.926 for n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated FA. The overall rate of disappearance for the major non-essential FA (myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic and oleic acids), estimated as 1-the overall fractional deposition rate, was 0.546. It is concluded that the high degree of FA unsaturation, high oxidation rate of LA and LNA, and poor synthesis of ARA from LA and of docosahexaenoic  from LNA found in the suckling piglet might increase the  cost of whole-body fat accretion, a contributor to the observed low efficiency of use of milk  for growth.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651160>Effects of 1-year intervention with a Mediterranean diet on plasma fatty  composition and  in a population at high cardiovascular risk.</a></h2><p> (MetS) has become an important public concern due to its increasing prevalence.

Participants aged 55 to 80 years and at high risk of cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to three dietary interventions: Mediterranean diet supplemented with virgin olive oil or nuts, or a low-fat diet.After 1 year of intervention participants in the virgin olive oil group showed significantly increased plasma concentrations of palmitic and oleic acids, but reduced proportions of margaric, stearic, and linoleic acids. In turn, subjects in the nut group showed significantly increased levels of palmitic, linoleic, and α- acids, but reduced proportions of myristic, margaric, palmitoleic, and dihommo-γ-linoleic acids. Increases in the biomarkers of foods supplied to the Mediterranean diet groups, i.e., oleic and α- acids, were beneficially associated with the incidence, reversion and prevalence of MetS. No weight changes were observed among participants.The nut and olive oil diets induced a fatty  composition that has been shown to be beneficial in the face of MetS. Therefore, a Mediterranean diet rich in fats of vegetable origin may be a useful tool for the management of MetS without the need for concerns over weight gain due to its high fat content.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN35739639.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance', 'metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29727591> and linoleic  differentially regulate the skeletal muscle secretome of obese Zucker rats.</a></h2><p>Evidence shows that proteins secreted from skeletal muscle influence a broad range of metabolic signaling pathways. We previously reported that essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) improved whole-body glucose homeostasis in obese Zucker rats; however, the mechanisms underlying these benefits remain enigmatic. While PUFA and  influence skeletal muscle function, their effects on the secretome are unknown. The aim of this work was to determine if improvements in whole-body glucose homeostasis in obese Zucker rats fed diets supplemented with either linoleic  (LA) or  (ALA) for 12 wk are related to changes in the skeletal muscle secretome. Secreted proteins were identified with a predictive bioinformatic analysis of microarray gene expression from red tibialis anterior skeletal muscle. Approximately 130 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate = 0.05) in obese rats compared with lean controls. The expression of 15 genes encoding secreted proteins was differentially regulated in obese controls, obese LA-supplemented, and obese ALA-supplemented rats compared with lean controls. Five secreted proteins ( Col3a1, Col15a1, Pdgfd, Lyz2, and Angptl4) were differentially regulated by LA and ALA. Most notably, ALA supplementation reduced Angptl4 gene expression compared with obese control and obese-LA supplemented rats and reduced circulating ANGPTL4 serum concentrations. ALA also influenced Angptl4 gene expression and ANGPTL4 secretion from differentiated rat L6 myotubes.

The aim of this study was to determine whether flaxseed oil containing the plant-based omega-3 fatty  α- (ALA) is an effective modulator of inflammation and adipocyte dysfunction.Seventeen-week old male fa/fa and lean Zucker rats were fed a control diet (faCTL, lnCTL) and fa/fa rats were fed an ALA-rich flaxseed oil supplemented diet (faFLAX) for 8 weeks. Adipose tissue and serum were collected and analyzed for cytokine (IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α), haptoglobin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and adipokine (leptin, adiponectin) levels. Splenocytes were isolated and ex vivo mitogen-stimulated cytokine production was measured. Digital images of adipose tissue sections were used to quantify adipocyte area. Macrophage and T-cell infiltration were assessed in adipose tissue by immunohistochemistry.faFLAX rats had 17% smaller adipocytes and 5-fold lower MCP-1 levels in adipose tissue than faCTL rats. Adipose tissue levels of IL-10 were 72% lower in the faFLAX group compared to baseline, and TNF-α levels decreased 80% (equal to lnCTL levels) in the faFLAX group compared to faCTL. There were no changes in ex vivo cytokine production by splenocytes between faFLAX and faCTL. Macrophage infiltration was not different among groups; however, faFLAX rats had less T-cell infiltration than faCTL rats.Dietary intervention with ALA-rich flaxseed oil in obese Zucker rats reduced adipocyte hypertrophy, protein levels of inflammatory markers MCP-1 and TNF-α, and T-cell infiltration in adipose tissue. Modest improvements to other parameters of obesity were also observed. The results suggest that, due to its ability to improve adipocyte function, ALA-rich flaxseed oil confers health benefits in obesity.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Linoleate and arachidonate supplements both decreased the initial high urinary AVP excretion, whereas it was further increased by the oleate supplement. There was no effect of columbinate supplementation on urinary AVP excretion. Urinary PGE2 excretion was increased ca. twofold by both linoleate and oleate supplements, increased ca. fivefold by arachidonate supplementation but was unaffected by columbinate supplementation. There was no effect of any of the supplemented fatty acids on urine output. Fatty acid analysis of total kidney lipids revealed a low percentage of 20:3(n-9) in the rats supplemented with (n-6) fatty acid (L, A and C).

Geographical differences in incidence rates suggest a key effect of environmental factors, especially diet, in its aetiology. Epidemiologic and experimental studies have found a role of dietary lipids in cancer, particularly breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers. Their incidence in the Mediterranean countries, where the main source of fat is olive oil, is lower than in other areas of the world. Human studies about the effects of dietary lipids are little conclusive, probably due to methodological issues. On the other hand, experimental data have clearly demonstrated that the influence of dietary fats on cancer depends on the quantity and the type of lipids. Whereas a high intake of n-6 PUFA and saturated fat has tumor-enhancing effects, n-3 PUFA, conjugated linoleic  and gamma- have inhibitory effects. Data regarding MUFA have not always been conclusive, but high olive oil diets seem to have protective effects. Such effects can be due to oleic , the main MUFA in olive oil, and to certain minor compounds such as squalene and phenolic compounds. This work aims to review the current knowledge about the relationship between dietary lipids and cancer, with a special emphasis on olive oil, and the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects: modifications on the carcinogenesis stages, hormonal status, cell membrane structure and function, signal transduction pathways, gene expression, and immune system.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26559699>Chemical Composition and Medicinal Value of Fruiting Bodies and Submerged Cultured Mycelia of Caterpillar Medicinal Fungus Cordyceps militaris CBS-132098 (Ascomycetes).</a></h2><p>In this paper, we report the results of a proximate analysis (i.e., moisture, ash, protein, fat, carbohydrates, and ); a bioactive compounds analysis (i.e., cordycepin and ergothioneine); fatty and amino  analysis; and analyses of vitamin content, macro- and microelement composition of fruiting body (FB), and mycelial biomass (MB) of medicinal caterpillar fungus Cordyceps militaris strain CBS-132098. These results demonstrate that the FB and MB of C. militaris are good sources of proteins: 59.8% protein content in the FB and 39.5% in the MB. The MB was distinguished by its carbohydrate content (39.6%), which was higher than that of the FB (29.1% carbohydrate). In the FB of C. militaris, the total amino  content was 57.39 mg/g and in the MB it was 24.98 mg/g. The quantification of the identified fatty acids indicated that palmitic , oleic , linoleic , and  were the major fatty acids. The micro- and macroelement compositions were studied. The highest results were calcium (797 mg/kg FB; 11 mg/kg MB); potassium (15,938 mg/kg FB 12,183 mg/kg MB); magnesium (4,227 mg/kg FB; 3,414 mg/kg MB); sodium (171 mg/kg FB; 1,567 mg/kg MB); phosphorus (7,196 mg/kg FB; 14,293 mg/kg MB); and sulfur (5,088 mg/kg FB; 2,558 mg/kg MB). The vitamin composition was studied, and the most abundant vitamins were vitamin A, vitamin B3, and vitamin E. The bioactive components were cordycepin, cordycepic  (D-mannitol), and ergothioneine. There were differences in cordycepin and ergothioneine contents between the FB and the MB. The cordycepin concentration was 0.11% in the FB and 0.182% in the MB, the cordycepic  was 4.7 mg/100g in the FB and 5.2 mg/100 g in the MB, and the ergothioneine content was 782.37 mg/kg in the FB and 130.65 mg/kg in the MB.

Injection of 3.6 mg/day of PUFA resulted in up to a two- to threefold increase in spleen weight. Spleen cell response to mitogens was reduced by about 70%; mixed lymphocyte responses were reduced by about 90% when compared to normal values. In admixture experiments, spleen cells from PUFA treated mice suppressed the mitogen induced blastogenic response of control spleen cells by up to 90%. Fractionation of spleen cells from PUFA treated mice by G-10 adherence resulted in an enrichment of suppressive activity in the adherent cells. The suppressive effect of G-10 adherent cells was abolished by the addition of indomethacin as well as by depletion of macrophages by treatments with agents such as carbonyl iron and leucine methyl ester.

Therefore, maintenance of essential nutrition support or altered gas exchange could preserve fruit quality, minimizing chilling injury. Thus our aim was to determine the response to postharvest application of a low concentration of nitrogen (urea) or antitranspirant (pinolene) during a period of 21 days at 5 °C.The results indicate that storage at 5 °C was effective with respect to maintaining firmness of sweet pepper fruits for 21 days, while application of antitranspirant increased firmness compared with non-sprayed fruits. Additionally, urea maintained color while increasing total phenolics and the activity of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase, lowering lipid peroxidation. Composition of free amino acids was affected to a minor extent.Maintaining quality is of paramount importance in the postharvest period. This study shows the effect of both temperature and spraying treatments with regard to maintaining fruit quality during this period, and provides new insights into the physiological role of enzymes of the antioxidant system during pepper storage at low temperature.Copyright © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28821830>Disease- combination modeling: metabolomic strategy for the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Conventional disease animal models have limitations on the conformity to the actual clinical situation.

Disease model and DS model of renal fibrosis in chronic kidney disease were established by ligating the left ureter and by ligating unilateral ureteral combined with exhaustive swimming, respectively. Serum metabolomics was conducted to evaluate disease model and DS model by using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Potential endogenous biomarkers were identified by multivariate statistical analysis. There are no differences between two models regarding their clinical biochemistry and kidney histopathology, while metabolomics highlights their difference. It is found that abnormal sphingolipid metabolism is a common characteristic of both models, while arachidonic  metabolism,  metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism are highlighted in DS model. Metabolomics is a promising approach to evaluate experiment animal models.

Mitochondrial distribution in control oocytes at 0h was mainly peripheral and changed to a diffused pattern after 1h of culture; this was maintained up to 24h. Mitochondrial clusters were observed during the early hours of maturation (1-4h); the majority of these were arranged in perinuclear fashion. LA supplementation resulted in: (1) delayed redistribution of the mitochondria from a peripheral to a diffuse pattern and a decreased percentages of oocytes showing perinuclear mitochondrial clusters, (2) decreased mitochondrial inner membrane potential at 1 and 24h compared with the control and (3) higher ROS levels, associated with a lower nuclear maturation rate. In contrast, ALA supplementation had no effect on mitochondrial distribution and activity and decreased ROS levels compared with the control; this was associated with an increased nuclear maturation rate.

The contribution of different EFAs and LCPUFAs to the fatty- composition of plasma and erythrocyte membrane lipids was found to be reduced in children with PEM in comparison with well-nourished children. In addition to limited dietary EFA supply, reduced bioconversion of EFAs to their respective LCPUFA metabolites and/or peroxidative degradation of LCPUFAs may contribute to the reduction of LCPUFA status in malnourished children. Restoration of normal energy, protein, and EFA intakes does not appear to readily correct abnormalities of plasma and erythrocyte membrane LCPUFA values. Enhanced dietary supply of LCPUFAs and/or improved supply of antioxidant vitamins may represent novel therapeutic modalities in severe PEM. With and without PEM, HIV infection was related to altered availability of various EFAs and LCPUFAs in HIV-seropositive children. The plasma total lipid fatty- profiles seen in well-nourished children with HIV infection were compatible with an HIV infection-related enhancement of the  activity of the conversion of EFAs to their respective LCPUFA metabolites.

Each year, 75 multiparous (≥3 calving) pregnant Angus cows were stratified by BW (663 ± 21.5 kg) and BCS (2.6 ± 0.12; 1 to 5 scale) and randomly assigned to 1 of 15 outdoor pens. Subsequently, each pen was randomly assigned to 1 of 3 (n = 5) treatments: a low- diet (LF; 1.4 ± 0.12% EE) consisting of grass-legume hay, barley straw, and barley grain, or 1 of 2 high- diets (HF; 3.3 ± 0.20% EE) that included either a canola seed (CAN) or a flaxseed (FLX) based pelleted feed. Diets were formulated to meet the requirements of pregnant beef cows during the last 2 trimesters of gestation (0.183 ± 4.8 d), adjusted for changes in environmental conditions, and offered such that each pen on average received similar daily amounts of DE (31.2 ± 2.8 Mcal/cow), CP (1.36 ± 0.13 kg/cow), and DM (12.9 ± 1.0 kg/cow). Data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design with contrasts to separate the effects of level (LF vs. HF) and source (CAN vs. FLX) of . After 160 d on trial, conceptus corrected-BW (CC-BW) of LF cows (708 kg) and the proportion of overconditioned cows (13.2%) were greater (P ≤ 0.04) than those of HF, with no difference (P ≥ 0.84) between CAN and FLX for CC-BW (697 kg) and proportion of overconditioned cows (3.6% vs. 2.9%). Feeding FLX diet during gestation resulted in cows with a greater (P ≤ 0.01) concentration of conjugated  (0.12% vs. 0.05%) and n-3 (0.58% vs. 0.37%) fatty acids, and a tendency (P = 0.09) for conjugated linoleic  concentration (1.05% vs. 0.88%) to be greater in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) when compared with cows fed the CAN diet. By the end of gestation, serum NEFA concentration of LF cows (592 µEq/L) was lower (P < 0.01) than that of HF cows, and FLX cows had greater (P < 0.01) serum NEFA concentration than CAN cows (636 vs. 961 µEq/L). Cows receiving the LF diet during gestation gave birth to lighter (P < 0.01) calves compared with those receiving the HF diets (40.2 vs. 42.9 kg), with no difference (P = 0.24) between calves born to CAN (42.4 kg) and FLX (43.3 kg) cows. In conclusion, these results suggest a partitioning of the ME in pregnant beef cows that is dependent on the type of dietary energy, resulting in heavier calves at birth for cows fed high- diets. Also, the type of fatty  in the diet of gestating beef cows affected the fatty  profile in SCAT and serum NEFA concentration.© The Author(s) 2019.

As blood pressure (BP) is associated with (long-chain) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC PUFA), genetic variation in desaturase enzymes being involved in the synthesis of LC PUFA may be associated with BP. This study aimed to investigate the direct effects (independent of mediating variables) and indirect effects (mediated through intermediate variables) of a common variant in the FADS1 gene, rs174546, known to affect delta-5 desaturase (D5D) activity on PUFA level, body mass index (BMI) and BP.A subsample of the IDEFICS (Identification and prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants) baseline survey including 520 children aged 2 to <10 years from six European countries was included. The association between rs174546 (T<C) and BP z-score as well as the mediating effects of selected key PUFA levels (dihomo-gamma-, DGLA; arachidonic , ARA; eicosapentaenoic , EPA) or estimated D5D activity (D5D index) and BMI z-score were investigated through path model analyses, adjusting for sex, age, educational level of parents, family history of hypertension, lifestyle factors and blood levels of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Whole blood fatty acids were measured by a validated gas chromatographic method and recorded as percentage of weight of all fatty acids detected.Minor allele carriers of the SNP rs174546 had significantly higher DGLA and lower ARA and EPA levels as well as a lower D5D index. Via ARA and BMI z-score, the polymorphism had an indirect lowering effect on systolic BP z-score for each additional T allele (standardized effect estimate -0.057, p = 0.007). For DGLA, EPA and D5D index, the indirect effects of rs174546 on systolic BP were also negative but did not reach significance. DGLA and EPA had an increasing indirect effect on systolic BP via BMI. Results for diastolic BP were in general similar but effect estimates were lower compared to systolic BP.Genetic variation in FADS1 influences BP via ARA and BMI indicating a favorable effect of the minor allele in SNP rs174546. Thus, polymorphisms with an impact on the D5D activity may play a role for the BP level mediated through PUFA and BMI.

Both the activity of glutathione peroxidase and catalase in serum and milk in oil groups were decreased, which were negatively correlated with the levels of cis-9, trans-11 CLA and ALA. The concentrations of proinflammatory factors (TNF-α and INF-γ) in serum of oil groups were lower than that from the CON cows.These results indicate that diet supplementation with rubber seed oil or flaxseed oil could alter serum fatty  profile and enhance the immune function of dairy cows.

In general, viable population did not change significantly after freeze-drying (p > 0.05). In most cases, viable population for cells added with cryoprotectants was significantly lower than those without (p < 0.05). Cellular fatty acids (CFAs) from the two strains in this study were analyzed before and after freeze-drying.

We studied the long-term diabetic risk in GDM offspring and evaluated the effect of n-3 PUFA intervention. Healthy offspring rats were fed standard diet (soybean oil) after weaning. GDM offspring were divided into three groups: GDM offspring (soybean oil), n-3 PUFA adequate offspring (fish oil), and n-3 PUFA deficient offspring (safflower oil), fed up to 11 months old. The diabetic risk of GDM offspring gradually increased from no change at weaning to obvious impaired glucose and insulin tolerance at 11 months old. N-3 PUFA decreased oxidative stress and  in the liver of older GDM offspring. There was a differential effect of n-3 PUFA and n-6 PUFA on hepatic telomere length in GDM offspring. Non-targeted metabolomics showed that n-3 PUFA played a modulating role in the liver, in which numerous metabolites and metabolic pathways were altered when GDM offspring grew to old age. Many metabolites were related to diabetes risk, such as α-, palmitic , ceramide, oxaloacetic , tocotrienol, tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol, andniacinamide. In summary, GDM offspring exhibited obvious diabetes risk at old age, whereas n-3 PUFA decreased this risk.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30053299>Effect of fungal gamma- and beta-carotene containing prefermented feed on  and gut of broiler chicken.</a></h2><p>Gamma- (GLA) is a fatty  from the ω-6 family. It is able to deliver a wide range of health benefits arising from its anti-inflammatory effects. An insufficient supply of GLA from agricultural and animal sources resulted in the development of a fermentation technique using lower filamentous fungi, which have the ability to accumulate high concentrations of GLA and beta-carotene during solid-state fermentation of cereals. The goal of this study was to observe the influence of the addition of prefermented cereal product, containing high amounts of GLA and beta-carotene, into the feed of broiler chickens on their immune status, and also the number of lactic  bacteria and enterobacteria in gut content, which has never been studied before. Immunostimulation in the GLA group was manifested by a significant increase in the oxidative burst of phagocytes, CD4+CD8- lymphocytes in blood, and the CD4: CD8 ratio. Upregulation of gene expression for IgA in the GLA group indicates that the B-lymphocytes were stimulated at a local gut level. In the caecum, increased mRNA expression for mucin-2 and insulin-like growth factor was observed in the GLA group, which could contribute mainly to the protection of the intestinal mucosa and to better growth and regeneration of skeletal muscles. Improved immune activation and protection of the intestinal mucosa were subsequently reflected in a change of the microbial composition in gut contents; a significant reduction of enterobacteria occurred after GLA administration. We can conclude that prefermented cereals containing fungal GLA and beta-carotene represent a low-cost supplement for broiler diet having a beneficial health effect.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30105961>Serum fatty acids and progression from dengue fever to dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome.</a></h2><p>PUFA might modulate inflammatory responses involved in the development of severe dengue. We aimed to examine whether serum PUFA concentrations in patients diagnosed with dengue fever (DF) were related to the risk of progression to dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). A secondary aim was to assess correlations between fatty acids (FA) and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with DF. We conducted a prospective case-control study nested within a cohort of patients who were diagnosed with DF and followed during the acute episode. We compared the distribution of individual FA (% of total FA) at onset of fever between 109 cases who progressed to DHF/DSS and 235 DF non-progressing controls using unconditional logistic regression. We estimated correlations between baseline FA and cytokine concentrations and compared FA concentrations between the acute episode and >1 year post-convalescence in a subgroup. DHA was positively related to progression to DHF/DSS (multivariable adjusted OR (AOR) for DHA in quintile 5 v. 1=5·34, 95 % CI 2·03, 14·1; P trend=0·007). Dihomo-γ- (DGLA) was inversely associated with progression (AOR for quintile 5 v. 1=0·30, 95 % CI 0·13, 0·69; P trend=0·007). Pentadecanoic  concentrations were inversely related to DHF/DSS. Correlations of PUFA with cytokines at baseline were low. PUFA were lower during the acute episode than in a disease-free period. In conclusion, serum DHA in patients with DF predicts higher odds of progression to DHF/DSS whereas DGLA and pentadecanoic  predict lower odds.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21784965>A peroxygenase pathway involved in the biosynthesis of epoxy fatty acids in oat.</a></h2><p>While oat (Avena sativa) has long been known to produce epoxy fatty acids in seeds, synthesized by a peroxygenase pathway, the gene encoding the peroxygenase remains to be determined. Here we report identification of a peroxygenase cDNA AsPXG1 from developing seeds of oat. AsPXG1 is a small protein with 249 amino acids in length and contains conserved heme-binding residues and a calcium-binding motif. When expressed in Pichia pastoris and Escherichia coli, AsPXG1 catalyzes the strictly hydroperoxide-dependent epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. It prefers hydroperoxy-trienoic acids over hydroperoxy-dienoic acids as  donors to oxidize a wide range of unsaturated fatty acids with cis double bonds. Oleic  is the most preferred substrate. The acyl carrier substrate specificity assay showed phospholipid and acyl-CoA were not effective substrate forms for AsPXG1 and it could only use free fatty  or fatty  methyl esters as substrates. A second gene, AsLOX2, cloned from oat codes for a 9-lipoxygenase catalyzing the synthesis of 9-hydroperoxy-dienoic and 9-hydroperoxy-trienoic acids, respectively, when linoleic (18:2-9c,12c) and  (18:3-9c,12c,15c) acids were used as substrates. The peroxygenase pathway was reconstituted in vitro using a mixture of AsPXG1 and AsLOX2 extracts from E. coli. Incubation of methyl oleate and linoleic  or  with the enzyme mixture produced methyl 9,10-epoxy stearate. Incubation of linoleic  alone with a mixture of AsPXG1 and AsLOX2 produced two major epoxy fatty acids, 9,10-epoxy-12-cis-octadecenoic  and 12,13-epoxy-9-cis-octadecenoic , and a minor epoxy fatty , probably 12,13-epoxy-9-hydroxy-10-transoctadecenoic .

Male weanling mice were fed for 7 d on one of nine diets which contained 178 g lipid/kg and which differed in the type of n-3 PUFA and in the position of these in dietary triacylglycerol (TAG). The control diet contained 4.4 g /100 g total fatty acids. In the other diets, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) or docosahexaenoic  (DHA) replaced a proportion (50 or 100 %) of the , and were in the sn-2 or the sn-1(3) position of dietary TAG. There were significant increases in the content of n-3 PUFA in spleen-cell phospholipids when EPA or DHA was fed. These increases were largely independent of the position of EPA or DHA in dietary TAG except when EPA was fed at the highest level, when the incorporation was greater when it was fed in the sn-2 than in the sn-1(3) position. There was no significant effect of dietary DHA on monocyte or neutrophil phagocytic activity. Dietary EPA dose-dependently decreased the number of monocytes and neutrophils performing phagocytosis. However, when EPA was fed in the sn-2 position, the ability of active monocytes or neutrophils to engulf bacteria was increased in a dose-dependent fashion. This did not occur when EPA was fed in the sn-1(3) position. Thus, there appears to be an influence of the position of EPA, but not of DHA, in dietary TAG on its incorporation into cell phospholipids and on the activity of phagocytic cells.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27197628>Effect of long-term ingestion of weakly oxidised flaxseed oil on biomarkers of oxidative stress in LDL-receptor knockout mice.</a></h2><p>The effect of oxidised fatty acids on atherosclerosis progression is controversial. Thus, our objective was to evaluate the effect of long-term consumption of weakly oxidised PUFA from flaxseed oil on oxidative stress biomarkers of LDL-receptor(-/-) mice. To test our hypothesis, mice were separated into three groups. The first group received a high-fat diet containing fresh flaxseed oil (CONT-), the second was fed the same diet prepared using heated flaxseed oil (OXID), and the third group received the same diet containing fresh flaxseed oil and had diabetes induced by streptozotocin (CONT+). Oxidative stress, aortic parameters and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were assessed. After 3 months, plasma lipid profile, glucose levels, body weight,  intake and dietary intake did not differ among groups. Likewise, oxidative stress, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), hepatic MDA expressed as nmol/mg portion (ptn) and antioxidant enzymes did not differ among the groups. Hepatic linoleic , α-, arachidonic  and EPA  declined in the OXID and CONT+ groups. Aortic wall thickness, lumen and diameter increased only in the OXID group. OXID and CONT+ groups exhibited higher concentrations of MDA, expressed as μmol/mg ptn per %PUFA, when compared with the CONT- group. Our results suggest that ingestion of oxidised flaxseed oil increases hepatic MDA concentration and is potentially pro-atherogenic. In addition, the mean MDA value observed in all groups was similar to those reported in other studies that used xenobiotics as oxidative stress inducers. Thus, the diet applied in this study represents an interesting model for further research involving antioxidants.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24064233>Dietary Hizikia fusiformis glycoprotein-induced IGF-I and IGFBP-3 associated to somatic growth, polyunsaturated fatty  metabolism, and  in juvenile olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus.</a></h2><p>This study was aimed to examine the effect of dietary glycoprotein extracted from the sea mustard Hizikia fusiformis (Phaeophyceae: Sargassaceae) as a dietary supplement on growth performance in association with somatotropin level, proximate compositions, and  in juvenile olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus.

Both mitogen (ConA)-induced proliferative lymphocyte responsiveness during 4 days of culture and eicosanoid (prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4))) production during 36 h were determined in relation to the absence or presence of various concentrations of LA and LNA (0, 1, 5, 25, 125 and 250 microM). Mitogen-driven proliferative responses of lymphocytes tended to be uninfluenced in the presence of lower concentrations of LA, whereas significant inhibition was observed at the higher concentrations of LA (125 and 250 microM). However, increasing amounts of LNA did not affect the proliferation. ConA stimulation induced a clear PGE(2) response, which significantly decreased in the presence of 250 microM of LA. In addition, increasing amounts of LNA, but not LA, led to a significant decrease in LTB(4) levels. However, The production of LTB(4) did not alter due to mitogenic stimulation.

Anaerobic incubation of NOB or 2-NOF with linolenic acid at the molar ratio of 1:1 for 24 h yielded approximately 5.5-13% of the PUFA as conjugated diene which appeared stable upon exposure to air. Interaction of PUFA and 2-NOF or NOB yielded MDA, the amounts of which were significantly greater when 24-h anaerobic preceded 1-6-h aerobic incubation. Furthermore, the differences in the amounts of MDA resulting from 24- and 0-h anaerobic incubations were significantly greater when the molar ratio of 2-NOF (or NOB) to PUFA was increased (2.0 greater than 1.0 greater than 0.5). Superoxide dismutase or catalase had no effect on the yields of MDA following either anaerobic/aerobic or aerobic incubations of PUFA and 2-NOF. EDTA (1 or 10 microM) had no effect on the yields of MDA from aerobic incubations, but it decreased the amounts of MDA (by approximately 30 or 60%, respectively) from anaerobic/aerobic incubations. The data suggested that inhibition by EDTA was due to chelation of trace iron, which following anaerobic interaction of PUFA and 2-NOF might have been reduced to Fe2+ and contributed to the enhanced  peroxidation. Thus, adduction of C-nitroso aromatics to PUFA yields radical species which directly and/or via reaction with trace iron lead to  peroxidation. The lipophilicity of C-nitroso aromatics suggests that this process may be of consequence in their mutagenesis/carcinogenesis.</p><p>Keyword:[' methyl esterfat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030167>Walnuts change lipoprotein composition suppressing TNFα-stimulated cytokine production by diabetic adipocyte.</a></h2><p>Walnut consumption can provide both vascular and metabolic health benefits, and walnut-induced changes in lipoprotein particle chemical payloads may be responsible for these health benefits. To explore this possibility with a focus on metabolic health, this study investigated the impact of walnut consumption on lipoprotein  composition and changes in LDL anti-inflammatory properties, as reported by inflamed adipocyte. Hypercholesterolemic, postmenopausal females were treated with 40 g/day (i.e., 1.6 servings/day; n=15) of walnuts for 4 weeks. Fatty acids and their oxygenated metabolites, i.e., oxylipins, were quantified in isolated lipoproteins. Human primary adipocytes were exposed to LDL and TNFα-stimulated adipokine production was measured. Walnut treatment elevated α- and its epoxides in all lipoproteins and depleted mid-chain alcohols in VLDL and LDL, but not HDL. Walnuts also reduced TNFα-induced diabetic adipocyte production of IL-6 (-48%, P=.0006) and IL-8 (-30%, P=.01), changes inversely correlated with levels of α--derived epoxides but not α- itself. In conclusion, modest walnut consumption can alter lipoprotein  profiles and enhance their ability to inhibit TNFα-dependent pro-inflammatory responses in human diabetic primary adipocytes. Moreover, this study suggests the oxylipins, rather than the parent fatty acids, mediate LDL action of adipocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies using nonresponding to oxylipins (noxy), a series of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants insensitive to the 9-LOX product 9-hydroxy-10,12,15-octadecatrienoic  (9-HOT), have demonstrated the importance of cell wall modifications as a component of 9-LOX-induced defense. Here, we show that a majority (71%) of 41 studied noxy mutants have an added insensitivity to isoxaben, an herbicide inhibiting cellulose synthesis and altering the cell wall. The specific mutants noxy2, noxy15, and noxy38, insensitive to both 9-HOT and isoxaben, displayed enhanced susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 as well as reduced activation of salicylic -responding genes. Map-based cloning identified the mutation in noxy2 as At5g11630 encoding an uncharacterized mitochondrial protein, designated NOXY2. Moreover, noxy15 and noxy38 were mapped at the DYNAMIN RELATED PROTEIN3A and FRIENDLY MITOCHONDRIA loci, respectively. Fluorescence microscopy and molecular analyses revealed that the three noxy mutants characterized exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and that 9-HOT added to wild-type Arabidopsis causes mitochondrial aggregation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.

Flaxseed contains 35% of its mass as oil, of which 55% is  (ALA). Flax meal, which is devoid of oil, contains the lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). Flaxseed, flaxseed with very low ALA, flaxseed oil, flax lignan complex (FLC), and SDG reduce the development of hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis by 46%, 69%, 0%, 73%, and 34%, respectively, in the rabbit model. FLC and SDG slow the progression of atherosclerosis but have no effect in regression of atherosclerosis. Suppression of atherosclerosis by flaxseed is the result of its lignan content and not the result of ALA content. Suppression of atherosclerosis is associated with lowering of serum lipids and antioxidant activity. Effects of flaxseed on serum lipids in experimental animals are variable from no change to slight reduction. Flaxseed oil does not affect serum lipids, except for a slight reduction in serum triglycerides. Lignan in general reduces serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and raises serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. SDG and its metabolites have antioxidant activity. Flaxseed and flaxseed oil do not have antioxidant activity except they suppress  radical production by white blood cells. Flaxseed oil/ALA has variable effects on inflammatory mediators/markers (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid A). Doses of ALA less than 14 g/d do not affect inflammatory mediators/markers, but 14 g/d or greater reduce inflammatory mediators/markers. Flaxseed oil decreases soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 but has no effect on soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble E-selectin, and monocyte colony-stimulating factor. Flaxseed has variable effects on IL-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. FLC reduces plasma levels of C-reactive protein but has no effects on IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, or monocyte chemoattractant protein. Flaxseed has a very small hypotensive effect, but flaxseed oil does not lower blood pressure. However, SDG is a very potent hypotensive agent. Flaxseed oil decreases platelet aggregation and increases platelet activating inhibitor-1 and bleeding time. Flaxseed and FLC have no effect on the hemopoietic system. SDG is a potent angiogenic and antiapoptotic agent that may have a role in cardioprotection in ischemic heart disease. In conclusion, flaxseed, FLC, and SDG, but not flaxseed oil, suppress atherosclerosis, and FLC and SDG slow progression of atherosclerosis but have no effect on regression.

The fatty acid-dependent generation of carbonyl groups and loss of lysine residues increased in the order methyl linoleate <  < methyl arachidonate. The amounts of alkyl hydroperoxides, malondialdehyde, and a number of other aldehydes that accumulated when polyunsaturated fatty acids were oxidized in the presence of BSA were significantly lower than that observed in the absence of BSA. Direct treatment of proteins with various  hydroperoxides led to a slight increase in the formation of protein carbonyl derivatives, whereas treatment with the hydroperoxides together with Fe(II) led to a substantial increase in the formation of protein carbonyls. These results are consistent with the proposition that metal-catalyzed oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids can contribute to the generation of protein carbonyls by direct interaction of  oxidation products (alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes) with lysine residues (Michael addition reactions) and also by interactions with alkoxyl radicals obtained by Fe(II) cleavage of  hydroperoxides that are formed.

Delta-5 desaturase (D5D) is an enzyme that metabolizes dihomo-γ- (DGLA) to arachidonic  (AA). Thus, D5D inhibition increases DGLA (precursor to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids) while decreasing AA (precursor to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids), and could result in synergistic improvement in the low-grade inflammatory state. Here, we demonstrate reduced insulin resistance and the anti- effect of a D5D selective inhibitor (compound-326), an orally active small-molecule, in a high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model. In vivo D5D inhibition was confirmed by determining changes in blood AA/DGLA profiles. In DIO mice, chronic treatment with compound-326 lowered insulin resistance and caused body weight loss without significant impact on cumulative calorie intake.

In addition, FFAs in combination with RNI played critical roles in manifestation of the activity of M(phi) against mycobacterial organisms. Moreover, our recent studies have shown the following findings. First, anti-MTB activity of IFN-gamma-activated M(phi)s was specifically blocked by arachidonyl trifluoromethylketone (aTFMK), an inhibitor of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Second, ATP potentiated the anti-MAC bactericidal activity of M(phi)s cultivated in the presence of clarithromycin and rifamycin. This effect of ATP was closely related to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and was specifically blocked by aTFMK. Third, intramacrophage translocation of membranous AA molecules to MAC-containing phagosomes was also specifically blocked by aTFMK. In the confocal microscopic observation of MAC-infected M(phi)s, ATP enhanced the intracellular translocation of cPLA2 into MAC-containing phagosomes.

The odds ratios (ORs) of IR taking the lowest quartile of ALA or EPA+DHA intake as the reference were calculated by logistic regression analysis.Mean age, body mass index (BMI), and dietary ALA, and median of dietary EPA+DHA were 47.9 years, 22.9 kg/m(2), and 1.90 g/day (0.88%E) and 0.77 g/day (0.36%E), respectively. The ORs of IR decreased across the quartiles of ALA intake (multivariate-adjusted OR for Q4 versus Q1=0.74, P for trend=0.01) and the association was observed only in subjects with a BMI of <25 kg/m(2) (P for interaction=0.033). However EPA+DHA showed no such associations consistently.Higher ALA intake was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of IR in normal weight individuals of middle-aged Japanese men and women.Copyright (c) 2010 The Institute For Cancer Prevention.

The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of CLA and essential fatty acids on the expression of pro and anti- inflammatory cytokines and their protective efficacy against inflammatory status in mammary gland by an in vitro model based on bovine mammary epithelial cells (BME-UV1). Bovine mammary epithelial cells were treated with complete medium containing either 50 µM of cis-9, trans-11 CLA (c9,t11 CLA) or trans-10, cis-12 CLA (t10,c12 CLA) or (α)- (aLnA) or (γ)- (gLnA) or linoleic  (LA). After 48 h by fatty acids administration the cells were treated for 3 h with 20 µM of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce inflammatory stimulus. Reactive  species (ROS) production after treatments was assessed to verify and to compare the potential protection of different fatty acids against LPS-induced oxidative stress. The messenger RNA abundance of bovine pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukine-10 (IL-10)) and peroxisome proliferator receptor-α/γ (PPARγ/α) were determined in BME-UV1 by real-time PCR. The results showed that cells treated with fatty acids and LPS increased ROS production compared with control cells. Among treatments, cells treated with c9,t11 CLA and t10,c12 CLA isomers revealed significant lower levels of ROS production compared with other fatty acids. All fatty acids reduced the gene expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Among fatty acids, t10,c12 CLA, LA and gLnA showed an homogeneous reduction of the three pro-inflammatory cytokines and this may correspond to more balanced and efficient physiological activity and may trigger a better protective effect. The PPARγ gene expression was significantly greater in cells treated with t10,c12 CLA, aLnA and LA, whereas the PPARα gene expression levels were significantly lower in cells treated with all different fatty acids, compared with the control. These results suggest that fatty acids inhibited the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the upregulation of PPARγ expression.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496224>Mass Spectrometry Characterization of Thiol Conjugates Linked to Polyoxygenated Polyunsaturated Fatty  Species.</a></h2><p>Radical mediated oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is known to generate a series of polyoxygenated cyclic products (PUFA-O,  ≥ 3). Here, we describe the characterization of glutathione (GSH) conjugates bound to polyoxygenated docosahexaenoic (DHA-O,  = 3-9), arachidonic (ARA-O,  = 3-7), α- (ALA-O), and linoleic (LA-O)  species. Similar conjugates were also characterized for -acetylcysteine (NAC) and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Extensive LC-MS/MS characterization using a synthetic α- hydroxy-endoperoxide (ALA-O) derivative revealed at least two types of mechanisms leading to thiol adduction: a mechanism involving the nucleophilic attack by thiolate anion on 1,2-dioxolane to form a sulfenate ester-bonded conjugate and a mechanism involving cleavage of the dioxolane to form a α,β-unsaturated carbonyl followed by the Michael addition reaction. Finally, we detected a GSH conjugate with hydroxy-endoperoxide derived from linoleic  (LA-O) in mice liver. In summary, our study reveals the formation of a series of thiol conjugates that are bound to highly oxygenated PUFA species.

These compounds are derived from the tri-unsaturated fatty acids  (18:3) and, in plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato, 7(Z)-, 10(Z)-, and 13(Z)-hexadecatrienoic  (16:3). The lipoxygenase-catalyzed addition of molecular  to  initiates jasmonate synthesis by providing a 13-hydroperoxide substrate for formation of an unstable allene oxide by allene oxide synthase (AOS). This allene oxide then undergoes enzyme-guided cyclization to produce 12-oxophytodienoic  (OPDA). These first steps take place in plastids, but further OPDA metabolism occurs in peroxisomes. OPDA has several fates, including esterification into plastid lipids and transformation into the 12-carbon prohormone jasmonic  (JA). JA is itself a substrate for further diverse modifications, including the production of jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), which is a major biologically active jasmonate among a growing number of jasmonate derivatives. Each new jasmonate family member that is discovered provides another key to understanding the fine control of gene expression in immune responses; in the initiation and maintenance of long-distance signal transfer in response to wounding; in the regulation of fertility; and in the turnover, inactivation, and sequestration of jasmonates, among other processes.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30170643>Acute effects of diets rich in almonds and walnuts on endothelial function.</a></h2><p>Omega-3 fatty acids, especially  (ALA), which are present in nuts may reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, by changing vascular  and improving endothelial dysfunction. The objective of the study was to evaluate the acute effects of two different diets, one containing walnuts and the other almonds on endothelial function.Twenty-seven overweight volunteers underwent a randomized 2-period, crossover, controlled intervention study. The subjects were given either walnut or almond diets which varied in monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) content. The walnut diet provided 23.1% energy from PUFA and the almond diet provided 7.6% energy from PUFA. Endothelial function was assessed physiologically by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and biochemically by sVCAM (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecules).The walnut diet significantly improved FMD (p=0.004) and decreased sVCAM (p=0.009) whereas the almond diet tended to improve FMD (p=0.06) and significantly decreased sVCAM (p=0.004).Both walnut and almond diets improved FMD and sVCAM and there was no significant difference in physiological and biochemical markers between the two diets.Copyright © 2018.

Potential beneficial effects of dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), such as α-, eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic  on hemorheology, vascular function, inflammation and potential to improve physical performance as well as other CV parameters are currently investigated. Recent meta-analysis suggests no effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on CV function and outcomes of CV diseases. On the other hand, some studies support beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs dietary intake on CV and muscular system, as well as on immune responses in healthy and in CV patients. Furthermore, the interaction of exercise and dietary n-3 PUFA intake is understudied. Supplementation of n-3 PUFAs has been shown to have antithrombotic effects (by decreasing blood viscosity, decreasing coagulation factor and PAI-1 levels and platelet aggregation/reactivity, enhancing fibrinolysis, but without effects on erythrocyte deformability). They decrease inflammation by decreasing IL-6, MCP-1, TNFα and hsCRP levels, expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules and significantly affect blood composition of fatty acids. Treatment with n-3 PUFAs enhances brachial artery blood flow and conductance during exercise and enhances microvascular post-occlusive hyperemic response in healthy humans, however, the effects are unknown in cardiovascular patients. Supplementation of n-3 PUFAs may improve anaerobic endurance and may modulate  consumption during intense exercise, may increase metabolic capacity, enhance endurance capacity delaying the onset of fatigue, and improving muscle hypertrophy and neuromuscular function in humans and animal models. In addition, n-3 PUFAs have anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects and may attenuate delayed-onset muscle soreness and muscle stiffness, and preserve joint mobility. On the other hand, effects of n-3 PUFAs were variably observed in men and women and they vary depending on dietary protocol, type of supplementation and type of sports activity undertaken, both in healthy and cardiovascular patients.

Considering that endothelial dysfunction induced by Angiotensin II plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and is accompanied by a prooxidative condition, which in turn induces an inflammatory state, vascular remodeling, and tissue damage, and that S. edule has been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive activity, its capability to control endothelial dysfunction was also assessed.To assess in vivo the anti-endothelial dysfunction activity of the acetone fraction (rSe-ACE) of the hydroalcoholic extract from S. edule roots.Endothelial dysfunction was induced in female C57BL/6 J mice by a daily intraperitoneal injection of angiotensin II for 10 weeks. Either rSe-ACE or losartan (as a control) were co-administered with angiotensin II for the same period. Blood pressure was measured at weeks 0, 5, and 10. Kidney extracts were prepared to determine IL1β, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL17, IFNγ, TNFα, and TGFβ levels by ELISA, along with the prooxidative status as assessed by the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The expression of ICAM-1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in kidney histological sections. Kidney and hepatic damage, as well as vascular tissue remodeling, were studied.The rSe-ACE fraction administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg was able to control hypertension, as well as the prooxidative and proinflammatory status in kidney as efficiently as losartan, returning mice to normotensive levels. Additionally, the fraction was more efficient than losartan to prevent liver and kidney damage.

Dyslipidemia and steatohepatitis are diseases that require effective treatments in obese and non-obese patients. The aim was to evaluate the effect of chia intake on acute tyloxapol (TI)-induced dyslipidemia, on acute carbon tetrachloride (TC)-induced steatohepatitis, and on mixed damage (TC+TI) in non-obese rats. Four experimental groups were fed for 4 weeks a diet with established rodent food (DE), and four groups were fed a diet with 15% added chia (DC). Plasma samples were analyzed for total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, biochemical liver damage markers, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Liver samples were used to quantify glycogen, catalase, lipid peroxidation, and TNF-α. A histopathological analysis was performed. DC intake partially or totally prevented steatohepatitis, and reduced lipids in the dyslipidemic groups. The hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects of chia may be correlated to its high content of α- (omega-3) and phenolics. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:  is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which are currently the most common causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Dyslipidemia is a significant risk factor for NAFLD and NASH. Non-obese patients may have NAFLD or NASH.  and dyslipidemia are more strongly associated with NAFLD in non-obese than in obese patients. This is the first study evaluating the hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects of chia seed intake on acute dyslipidemia and/or steatohepatitis caused by the individual or combined administration of the inducers tyloxapol and carbon tetrachloride, respectively, in non-obese rats. The pharmacological effects of dietary chia are correlated to its high content of omega-3 and omega-6 (1:1), protein, dietary fiber, and phenolics.

Treatment was not associated with changes in myocardial function. Myocardial collagen and triglycerides were similar among treatment groups; however, rats fed the high-fat diets, regardless of composition, demonstrated increased myocyte cross sectional area.Under conditions of high-fat feeding, replacement of 10% saturated fat with either LA or ALA is associated with thickening of the cranial LV wall, but without concomitant functional changes. Increased myocyte size appears to be a more likely contributor to early LV thickening in response to high-fat feeding. These findings suggest that myocyte hypertrophy may be an early change leading to gross LV hypertrophy in the hearts of "healthy" obese rats, in the absence of hypertension, diabetes and myocardial ischemia.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3918037>The  transformations of columbinic acid and the effect of topical application of the major metabolites on rat skin.</a></h2><p>The  of columbinic acid by various fatty acid oxidizing enzyme systems was studied.

Levels of plant delivered oils as source of fatty acids (FA) in aquafeeds have reached around 70% resulting in reduced levels of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA), such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), in salmon fillet composition. EPA and DHA can modulate  and immune response, so it is crucial to understand how fish immune response is affected by low LC n-3 PUFA diet and if this diet can have a detrimental effect on vaccine response. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) can produce EPA/DHA from α- (ALA) and this endogenous capacity can be explored to develop families with higher tolerance to low LC n-3 PUFA diets. Here we analyze innate and adaptive immune response in Atlantic salmon to a commercial vaccine after being fed low levels of EPA and DHA, and we also compare three strains of salmon selected by their endogenous capacity of synthesizing LC- n-3 PUFA. A total of 2,890 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (p-value adjusted < 0.1) when comparing vaccinated fish against control non-vaccinated. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis with 442 up/downregulated genes revealed that most DEGs were both related to immune response as well as part of important immune related pathways, as "Toll-like receptor" and "Cytokine-Cytokine interaction". Adaptive response was also addressed by measuring antigen specific IgM, and titers were significantly higher than in the pre-immune fish at 62 days post-immunization. However, diet and strain had no/little effect on vaccine-specific IgM or innate immune responses. Atlantic salmon therefore display robustness in its response to vaccination even when feed low levels of LC n-3 PUFA.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28490483>The ratio of dihomo-γ- to deoxycholic  species is a potential biomarker for the metabolic abnormalities in .</a></h2><p>Bile  (BA) signaling regulates fatty  metabolism.

For examining the antioxidant capacity of the experimental feeds, 24 piglets of 20 days old were assigned to two experimental groups receiving standard or experimental diet for 30 days. Blood and tissues collections were performed at four different time-points, 2, 20, 35 and 50 days post birth. The collected tissues were brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, quadriceps muscle, pancreas, spleen and stomach. The following oxidative stress markers were assessed: reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase activity, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyls (CARB) and H2O2 decomposition activity. The effect on bacterial growth was assessed by examining microbial populations in piglets' fecal microbiota.

However, the processes leading to this growth inhibition remain obscure. In this study, we provide evidence for a rapid inhibition of cell hydraulic conductivity (L) by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) in the roots of wild-type Arabidopsis within 0.5 h of 20 and 50 μM MeJA treatments. We also demonstrate that MeJA did not affect L in fad3-2 and fad7-2 Arabidopsis mutants that are deficient in jasmonate precursor, . The reductions of L in wild-type plants were accompanied by the down-regulation of several plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) isoforms, and dephosphorylation. Treatments with HgCl did not further reduce L in the wild-type plants, but significantly reduced L in the fad3-2 and fad7-2 that had been first treated with MeJA. Continuous prolonged exposure to exogenous 50 μM MeJA inhibited the relative growth rates (RGR) of shoots and net photosynthesis (P) in the Arabidopsis wild-type and fad7-2 plants, but had no effect on the RGR of roots.

Therefore, hares should select dietary plants rich in fat and . However, hares also require essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic  (LA) and  (ALA) to reproduce and survive. Although hares are able to absorb PUFA selectively in their gastrointestinal tract, it is unknown whether this mechanism is sufficient to guarantee PUFA supply. Thus, diet selection may involve a trade-off between a preference for  versus a preference for crucial nutrients, namely PUFA. We compared plant and nutrient availability and use by hares in an arable landscape in Austria over three years. We found that European hares selected their diet for high  content (crude fat and crude protein), and avoided crude fibre. There was no evidence of a preference for plants rich in LA and ALA. We conclude that fat is the limiting resource for this herbivorous mammal, whereas levels of LA and ALA in forage are sufficiently high to meet daily requirements, especially since their uptake is enhanced by physiological mechanisms. Animals selected several plant taxa all year round, and preferences did not simply correlate with crude fat content. Hence, European hares might not only select for plant taxa rich in fat, but also for high-fat parts of preferred plant taxa. As hares preferred weeds/grasses and various crop types while avoiding cereals, we suggest that promoting heterogeneous habitats with high crop diversity and set-asides may help stop the decline of European hares throughout Europe.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24915316>Bacterial production of conjugated linoleic and  in foods: a technological challenge.</a></h2><p>Conjugated linoleic  (CLA) and conjugated  (CLNA) isomers are present in foods derived from ruminants as a result of the respective linoleic  (LA) and α- (LNA) metabolism by ruminal microorganisms and in animals' tissues.

Expression of 14 placental genes associated with cholesterol packaging and transfer was assessed in rodent and human samples by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. In rats, placental mRNA expression of ApoA2, ApoC2, Cubn, Fgg, Mttp and Ttr was significantly elevated (3-30 fold) in animals fed a high LA (36% fat) diet, suggesting increased cholesterol transport across the placenta in this group.

Thereby, production of both reactive  intermediates and immune modulating cytokines is crucial for successful pathogen defense. Fatty acids may interfere with immune response in several ways. In this study, we investigated the influence of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on key macrophage functions. RAW264.7 macrophages were cultured in a medium supplemented with 2 or 15 micromol/L of the n-6 PUFA linoleic  (LA) or of the n-3 PUFA  (LNA), respectively. Cells were tested for incorporation of fatty acids as well as NADPH oxidase activity. Furthermore, supernatants were collected for detection of NO and cytokine release (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10). Exposure of RAW264.7 macrophages to LA or LNA resulted in incorporation of these fatty acids and their derivatives. Thereby, supplementation with both LA and LNA caused a significant increase in NADPH oxidase activity. In contrast, synthesis of NO was not affected by PUFA supplementation. Moreover, distinct effects could be seen in the release of immune modulating cytokines. Due to enhancement of NADPH oxidase activity, PUFA presumably promote the killing of pathogens crucial in host defense. In addition, the unsaturated fatty acids tested in our study were shown to modulate cytokine release by the macrophages, thus driving immune response into an anti-inflammatory direction. Of note, distinct differences between the n-6 PUFA LA and the n-3 PUFA LNA underline the impact of PUFA family on immune response.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Chromatograms of macrophages which were grown in the presence of a variety of fatty acids demonstrated that exogenously supplied unsaturated fatty acids (palmitoleic, oleic, elaidic, linoleic,  and arachidonic acids) were readily incorporated into the cells and selectively altered the fatty acyl composition of macrophage phospholipids. Up to 38% of the total cellular phospholipids were found to be derived from the exogenously added fatty  supplements. The incorporation of the different fatty acids into cellular phospholipids had striking effects on cellular phagocytic activity. These effects were found to correlate with the degree of unsaturation, and the cis- or trans-double bond configuration.

Given their importance in numerous physiological processes, the roles of LCFAs in health and disease have been extensively investigated. In the majority of studies, correlations are established using a single measurement in plasma or red blood cells (RBCs). Although a few studies have reported on reproducibility of individual fatty  measurements, the comprehensive analysis of intra-individual LCFA variability has not been performed. Therefore, our goal was to determine intra-individual variability for the 22 most abundant LCFAs in both plasma and RBC samples collected from healthy individuals on a regular diet after overnight fasting. The measurements of LCFAs in RBCs were consistent throughout the course of study reflecting long-term nutritional status. In contrast, the results in plasma showed considerable LCFA intra-individual variability, even between fatty acids of the same type. Plasma intra-individual variability for omega-3  and eicosapentaenoic acids in some participants were >40% whereas the variability of docosahexaenoic  was consistently <12.8%. Omega-6 linoleic and arachidonic acids also showed low variability in plasma. The results suggest that some LCFAs have less variability and would be more reliable as biomarkers. Reliability of biomarkers can have a profound impact on the research outcomes. Intra-individual variability of LCFAs should be taken into consideration in designing, conducting and interpreting results of clinical studies.Copyright © 2018.

However, the understanding of bioactivity and potential mechanism of α--rich flaxseed oil (ALA-FO) against insulin resistance was still limited. This study evaluated the effect of FO on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance in C57BL/6J mice focused on adipose tissue lipolysis. Mice after HFD feeding for 16 weeks (60% fat-derived calories) exhibited systemic insulin resistance, which was greatly attenuated by medium dose of FO (M-FO), paralleling with differential accumulation of ALA and its n-3 derivatives across serum lipid fractions. Moreover, M-FO was sufficient to effectively block the metabolic activation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), thereby improving adipose tissue insulin signaling. Importantly, suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α were involved in FO-mediated modulation of adipose tissue lipolysis, accompanied by specific reconstitution of n-3PUFA within adipose tissue lipid fractions.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21733300>Differences in arachidonic  levels and fatty  desaturase (FADS) gene variants in African Americans and European Americans with diabetes or the .</a></h2><p>Over the past 50 years, increases in dietary n-6 PUFA, such as linoleic , have been hypothesised to cause or exacerbate chronic inflammatory diseases.

Compared with European Americans (EAm), African Americans (AfAm) exhibited markedly higher serum levels of arachidonic  (AA) (EAm 7·9 (sd 2·1), AfAm 9·8 (sd 1·9) % of total fatty acids; P < 2·29 × 10⁻⁹) and the AA:n-6-precursor fatty  ratio, which estimates FADS1 activity (EAm 5·4 (sd 2·2), AfAm 6·9 (sd 2·2); P = 1·44 × 10⁻⁵). In all, seven SNP mapping to the FADS locus revealed strong association with AA, EPA and dihomo-γ- (DGLA) in the EAm.

Allele frequency patterns suggest that the GG genotype at rs174537 (associated with higher circulating levels of AA) is much higher in AfAm (0·81) compared with EAm (0·46). Similarly, marked differences in rs174537 genotypic frequencies were observed in HapMap populations.

A Mediterranean diet enriched in MUFA with virgin olive oil. 2. An SFA-rich diet. 3. A low-fat high-carbohydrate diet enriched in n-3 PUFA (α- of plant origin) (CHO-PUFA diet). At the end of each period, after a 12-h fast, the subjects received a meal with a composition similar to the dietary period just completed. We determined the fasting and the postprandial plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein (LBP).In the fasting state, we observed lower LPS plasma levels after the consumption of the CHO-PUFA diet (P=0.046) in comparison with the consumption of the Med and SFA-rich diets.

Mice were fed daily for 10 days with n-6/n-3 PUFAs, viz. linoleic  (LA), arachidonic  (AA),  and docosahexanoic  (DHA) in four separate test groups with phosphate-buffered saline fed mice as control set. The bone marrow cells of PUFA-fed mice showed a significantly higher hematopoiesis as assessed using side population, Lin-Sca-1ckit+, colony-forming unit (CFU), long-term culture, CFU-spleen assay and engraftment potential as compared to the control set. Thrombopoiesis was also stimulated in PUFA-fed mice. A combination of DHA and AA was found to be more effective than when either was fed individually. Higher incorporation of PUFAs as well as products of their metabolism was observed in the bone marrow cells of PUFA-fed mice. A stimulation of the Wnt, CXCR4 and Notch1 pathways was observed in PUFA-fed mice. The clinical relevance of this study was evident when bone marrow-transplanted recipient mice, which were fed with PUFAs, showed higher engraftment of donor cells, suggesting that the bone marrow microenvironment may also be stimulated by feeding with PUFAs.

In animal systems, NO2-FAs are considered novel signaling mediators of cell function based on a proven antiinflammatory response. Nevertheless, the interaction of NO with fatty acids in plant systems has scarcely been studied. Here, we examine the endogenous occurrence of nitro- (NO2-Ln) in Arabidopsis and the modulation of NO2-Ln levels throughout this plant's development by mass spectrometry. The observed levels of this NO2-FA at picomolar concentrations suggested its role as a signaling effector of cell function. In fact, a transcriptomic analysis by RNA-seq technology established a clear signaling role for this molecule, demonstrating that NO2-Ln was involved in plant defense response against different abiotic-stress conditions, mainly by inducing heat shock proteins and supporting a conserved mechanism of action in both animal and plant defense processes. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that NO2-Ln was also involved in the response to oxidative stress conditions, mainly depicted by H2O2, reactive  species, and -containing compound responses, with a high induction of ascorbate peroxidase expression. Closely related to these results, NO2-Ln levels significantly rose under several abiotic-stress conditions such as wounding or exposure to salinity, cadmium, and low temperature, thus validating the outcomes found by RNA-seq technology. Jointly, to our knowledge, these are the first results showing the endogenous presence of NO2-Ln in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and supporting the strong signaling role of these molecules in the defense mechanism against different abiotic-stress situations.© 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The BP-lowering effect of n-3 FA supplements among Chinese hypertensive patients has been reported in our previous 12-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT), but the benefits on cardiometabolic profiles among obese Chinese populations are not well known. We therefore used the data from the previous RCT to investigate the effects of marine- and plant-derived n-3 FA supplements on cardiometabolic profiles in middle-aged and elderly Chinese hypertensive patients with abdominal . In total, 108 eligible volunteers from Inner Mongolia, China were randomly assigned to three treatments for 12 weeks: fish oil (FO, n = 35, 2 g day-1 eicosapentaenoic  + docosahexaenoic ), flaxseed oil (FLO, n = 39, 2.5 g day-1 α-), and corn oil served as a control (CO, n = 34). BP, blood lipids, waist circumference (WC) and fasting glucose-insulin were measured at baseline and after 12-week intervention by using standard methods. Clustered cardiometabolic risk was expressed as a continuously distributed z-score calculated by standardizing and then summing WC, insulin, glucose, TG, HDL-cholesterol and BP values. The cardiometabolic risk scores were significantly lower in the FO group than in the CO group after the 12-week intervention (-0.41 ± 0.92 vs. 0.02 ± 0.95, p = 0.016), but not in the FLO group (-0.23 ± 1.02 vs. 0.02 ± 0.95, p = 0.109).

Human milk composition among lactating women in Latvia, as well as the maternal diet during lactation, has not been sufficiently studied. The aim of this research was to assess dietary habits and macronutrient intake among lactating women in Latvia and to examine the effect of diet on human milk composition. : Research was conducted between November 2016 and December 2017. Mature human milk samples ( = 61) along with a 72h food diary, a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and a questionnaire about maternal and infant characteristics were obtained from voluntary women who were recruited via an invitation published in a social media member group for nursing mothers. Fat content in human milk was determined by LVS ISO 2446:2008, protein content was determined by LVS EN ISO 8968-1:2014, lactose was determined by ISO 22662:2007, and the fatty  profile was analyzed using gas chromatography. Dietary data were evaluated using the Finnish food composition database Fineli, release 19 (3 March 2018). : Median values for fat, protein, and lactose in mature human milk were 4.40%, 1.08%, and 6.52%, respectively. Predominant fatty acids in human milk were oleic  (C18:1 n9), palmitic  (C16:0), and linoleic  (C18:2 n6) at 34.60%, 24.00%, and 11.00% of total fatty acids, respectively. The  elaidic  (C18:1 n9) level was <0.10% in all human milk samples. Significant, positive associations ( < 0.05) were found between maternal dietary intake of linoleic, α-, docosahexaenoic, total -monounsaturated, total -polyunsaturated, and total n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, the ratio of n-6/n-3, and the level of these fatty acids in human milk. Total  and carbohydrate intake among participants were lower, but total fat, saturated fat, and sugar intake were higher than recommended. Protein, linoleic , and α- intake were adequate, but docosahexaenoic  intake was noticeably lower than recommended. Women should be supported with information regarding their nutritional needs during lactation and the possible impact of diet on human milk composition. : Macronutrient (fat, protein, and lactose) content in human milk is not affected by maternal diet. Conversely, the human milk fatty  profile is affected by the immediate diet consumed by the mother.

AD pathogenesis remains elusive, but may involve complex interplays among skin barrier dysfunction, Th2 , and pruritus. Current treatments for AD are still limited to symptomatic therapies. We previously showed that HR-1 hairless mice fed a special diet (HR-AD) develop AD-like symptoms; however, the ingredient(s) causing dermatitis remain unclear. In this study, we examined whether the deficiency of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was involved in the diet-induced AD pathogenesis. In the serum of HR-AD-fed mice, levels of linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6) and α- (ALA, 18:3n-3), as well as their metabolites, were markedly decreased. HR-AD-induced AD symptoms were significantly ameliorated by LA supplementation, and to a lesser extent by ALA supplementation. In addition, LA metabolites, such as γ- and arachidonic , had effects similar to those of LA. Further, using semi-purified custom diets, we attempted to reproduce HR-AD-induced AD symptoms. Unexpectedly, a deficiency in unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) alone caused mild symptoms. However, several modifications of fat and carbohydrate components in the diet revealed that dietary deficiencies of UFA and cornstarch were required to fully induce severe AD symptoms. Furthermore, we examined the influence of genetic background on the development of diet-induced AD and found that a hypomorphic mutation in the hairless gene Hr, encoding a nuclear receptor (NR) corepressor, was essential for the complete development of diet-induced pruritic atopic skin. Thus, our findings suggest that certain PUFAs and NRs are new, potential therapeutic targets for treating AD.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25724148>9-Oxo-(10E,12E)-octadecadienoic , a cytotoxic fatty  ketodiene isolated from eggplant calyx, induces apoptosis in human ovarian cancer (HRA) cells.</a></h2><p>9-Oxo-(10E,12E)-octadecadienoic  (9-EE-KODE), which is isolated from the calyx of eggplants, exhibits cytotoxic activity against human ovarian cancer (HRA) cells.

The reinforcement is achieved by substituting the atoms of hydrogen at the bis-allylic methylene of these essential FAs with the isotope deuterium. This substitution leads to a significantly slower oxidation due to the kinetic isotope effect, inhibiting membrane damage. The approach has the advantage of preventing the harmful accumulation of reactive  species (ROS) by inhibiting the propagation of lipid peroxidation while antioxidants potentially neutralize beneficial oxidative species. Here, we developed a model system to mimic the human dietary requirement of omega-3 in  to study the role of deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acids (D-PUFAs). Deuterated trilinolenin [D-TG(54:9)] was sufficient to prevent the accumulation of lipid peroxides and to reduce the accumulation or ROS. Moreover, D-TG(54:9) significantly extended the lifespan of worms under normal and oxidative stress conditions.

However, after correcting for possible confounders such as body mass index (BMI), age, sex, fasting and use of statins, no statistically significant difference remained for serum omega-3 PUFA levels. Fasting was identified as an independent confounder of total omega-6 PUFAs, three individual omega-6 PUFAs and one omega-3 PUFA(p < 0.0427). Statin use was identified as an independent confounder of α- (an omega-3PUFA; p = 0.0210).In this pilot study with relatively low patient numbers, we report significant differences in serum levels of omega-3PUFAs among patients with different types of retinal diseases. However, these differences were not robust for disease specificity after correction for possible confounders in our cohort. Our results demonstrate that serum lipid profiles need to be interpreted with caution since they are significantly altered by variables like fasting and medication use independent from the underlying disease.

We identified and characterized the digital expression of 120 unigenes coding for 24 protein families involved in kernel glycolytic pathway. The expression levels of glycolytic genes were generally higher in younger kernels than in more mature kernels. Importantly, several unigenes from kernels of the high-ALA variety were expressed more than those from the low-ALA variety. The expression of 10 unigenes encoding key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway was validated by qPCR using RNAs from six kernel stages of each variety.

In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased  lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

In this study, we applied a methodology developed using rodents to investigate the whole-body, presumably hepatic, synthesis-secretion rates of esterified n-3 PUFA from circulating unesterified ALA in 2 healthy overweight women after 10 weeks of low-linoleate diet exposure. During continuous iv infusion of d5-ALA, 17 arterial blood samples were collected from each subject at -10, 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180, and 210 min, and at 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 h after beginning infusion. Plasma esterified d5-n-3 PUFA concentrations were plotted against the infusion time and fit to a sigmoidal curve using nonlinear regression. These curves were used to estimate kinetic parameters using a kinetic analysis developed using rodents. Calculated synthesis-secretion rates of esterified eicosapentaenoate, n-3 docosapentaenoate, docosahexaenoic , tetracosapentaenate, and tetracosahexaenoate from circulating unesterified ALA were 2.1 and 2.7; 1.7 and 5.3; 0.47 and 0.27; 0.30 and 0.30; and 0.32 and 0.27 mg/day for subjects S01 and S02, respectively. This study provides new estimates of whole-body synthesis-secretion rates of esterified longer-chain n-3 PUFA from circulating unesterified ALA in human subjects. This method now can be extended to study factors that regulate human whole-body PUFA synthesis-secretion in health and disease.© 2018 AOCS.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156785>The effect of  on tracheal responsiveness, lung , and immune markers in sensitized rats.</a></h2><p>The effects of  (ALA) on tracheal responsiveness (TR), total protein (TP), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), immunoglobulin E (IgE), interleukin 4 (IL-4), interferon gamma (INF-γ) level and INF-γ/IL4 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of sensitized rats were examined.TR to methacholine and ovalbumin (OA), BALF levels of TP, PLA2 and IgE as well as IL-4, INF-γ and INF-γ/IL4 ratio were measured in control group (non-sensitized, group C), sensitized rats to OA (group S), S groups treated with two concentrations of ALA and dexamethasone group.TR to methacholine and OA, BALF levels of TP, PLA2, IgE and IL-4 were significantly increased but BALF level of INF-γ and INF-γ/IL4 ratio decreased in group S compared to group C (<0.001 for all cases).

Recent studies suggest that phospholipid (PL) form of dietary n-3 PUFA may lead to their higher tissue accretion than triacylglycerol (TAG) form. We compared efficacy of PL-docosahexaenoic  (22:6n-3) (DHA) and TAG-DHA on onset and severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in a mouse model of MS. Female mice were fed low  (18:3n-3) (ALA) diet (control) for 2 weeks and then fed either control, 0.3%, or 1.0% DHA (PL or TAG) for 4 weeks pre-EAE induction and 4 weeks post-EAE induction. The brain and spinal cord n-6:n-3 ratio was significantly lower in all mice fed DHA compared to control. EAE onset was delayed in mice fed both DHA forms and concentrations, except for 1% TAG-DHA. The inverse association between the EAE score and the brain DHA concentration was nonsignificant at the end of the study (p = 0.08). Daily EAE scores of mice fed different DHA diets did not differ from control, however, the score of all DHA groups combined during days 9-16 was lower (p = 0.028) compared to the control. During days 17-22, the EAE score trended lower in 0.3% TAG-DHA and during days 23-28, the EAE score trended lower in both PL-DHA groups than those in all other groups. These findings suggest that TAG-DHA may be more effective than PL-DHA in the early phases of EAE, and in the final outcome, PL-DHA may be more effective than TAG-DHA.Published 2019.

At birth, male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to control (C) and experimental (FF) groups, whose dams were treated with a control or flaxseed flour diet, respectively, during lactation. At 21 days, pups were weaned and fed a control and experimental diet until 90 days. Food intake, body mass and length were evaluated during a 21-90 day period. At 90 days, composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, serum hormonal profile, intra-abdominal fat mass, and lumbar vertebra and femur analyses was determined. Differences were deemed significant at p < 0.05. The FF group displayed the following (P < 0.05): a higher total lean mass (+7%), a lower total (-16%) and intra-abdominal (-24%) fat mass, a smaller adipocyte area (-30%), a higher femoral mass (+5%), bone mineral density (+5%) and radiodensity (+20%), and a higher maximum force (+10%) and breaking strength (+11%).

Each strain could also degrade CO and FFAs. The level of bacterial crude-activity of extracellular lipases was found to be between 0.2 and 4U/ml. Using synthetic WW, the consortium could reduce 80% of the chemical  demand [from 10550 ± 2828 mg/l], 80% of nitrogen (from 410 ± 78 mgl/l) and 57% of phosphorus (from 93 ± 25 mg/l).

There has been a growing interest in establishing a bio-sustainable production of PUFA in several microorganisms, e.g. in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, PUFAs can also be toxic to cells because of their susceptibility to peroxidation. Here we investigated the negative effects of LA and GLA production on S. cerevisiae by characterizing a strain expressing active Δ6 and Δ12 desaturases from the fungus Mucor rouxii. Previously, we showed that the PUFA-producing strain has low viability, down-regulated genes for oxidative stress response, and decreased proteasome activity. Here we show that the PUFA strain accumulates high levels of reactive  species (ROS) and lipid peroxides, and accumulates damaged proteins. The PUFA strain also showed great increase in metacaspase Yca1p activity, suggesting cells could die by caspase-mediated cell death. When treated with antioxidant vitamin C, ROS, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation were greatly reduced, and the activity of the metacaspase was significantly decreased too, ultimately doubling the lifespan of the PUFA strain. When deleting YCA1, the caspase-like activity and the oxidative stress decreased and although the lifespan was slightly prolonged, the phenotype could not be fully reversed, pointing that Yca1p was not the main executor of cell death.© FEMS 2016.

During this period, the rats in groups L, A, and C all showed a decrease in their initially high trans-epidermal water loss, a classical essential fatty acid-deficiency symptom, to a level seen in non-deficient rats (group N). The trans-epidermal water loss in rats of group O was unaffected by the supplementation. Fatty acid composition of two epidermal sphingolipids, acylglucosylceramide and acylceramide, from the skin were determined. The results indicate that re-establishment of a low trans-epidermal water loss was associated with incorporation of linolenate into the two epidermal sphingolipids. Supplementation with columbinate resulted in relatively high amounts of this fatty acid in the investigated epidermal sphingolipids. Analysis of pooled skin specimens from a previous study in which weanling rats were fed a fat-free diet and supplemented orally with pure alpha-linolenate for 13 weeks (Hansen, H.S. and Jensen, B. (1983) Lipids 18, 682-690) revealed very little polyunsaturated fatty acid in the two sphingolipids. These rats showed increased evaporation which was comparable to that of essential fatty acid-deficient rats. We interpret these results as strong evidence for a very specific and essential function of linoleic acid in maintaining the integrity of the epidermal water permeability barrier. This function of linoleate is independent of its role as precursor for arachidonate and icosanoids.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29027487>Effect of tauroursodeoxycholic  on PUFA levels and  in an animal and cell model of hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate hepatic polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and inflammatory response in an animal and cell model of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.

Anthropometric evaluation, liver ultrasound examination and scoring for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD score = 0-6), and biochemical and plasma fatty acids analysis were performed. We compared the composition ratio of fatty acids between children with high-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 4-6), low-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 1-3), and healthy controls (NAFLD score = 0). In addition, correlation coefficients (r) between NAFLD score, metabolic variables, and estimated activity of desaturase indices (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1), delta-5 and delta-6 desaturase) were calculated.Compared with healthy controls, children with liver steatosis showed a higher proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (21.16 ± 2.81% vs. 19.68 ± 2.71%, p = 0.024). In addition, children with high- grade liver steatosis exhibited higher proportions of palmitic  (C16:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1n-7), dihomo-γ- (C20:3n-6), adrenic  (C22:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic  (C22:5n-6); and lower proportions of eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3) (P< 0.05).

Over the last decade, the identification of a family of cell-surface G protein-coupled receptors that bind and are activated by free-fatty acids, including omega-3 fatty acids, suggest that many effects of PUFA are receptor-mediated. One such receptor, free-fatty  receptor-4 (FFAR4), previously described as GPR120, has been shown to modulate anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects in response to PUFA such as ALA and DHA. Additionally, FFAR4 stimulates secretion of the insulin secretagogue glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from the GI tract and acts as a dietary sensor to regulate  availability. The aim of the current study was to assess the effects of dietary omega-3 fatty  supplementation on FFAR4 expression in the rat colon.Sprague-Dawley rats were fed control soybean oil diets or alternatively, diets supplemented with either fish oil, which is enriched in DHA and EPA, or flaxseed oil, which is enriched in ALA, for 7 weeks. GLP-1 and blood glucose levels were monitored weekly and at the end of the study period, expression of FFAR4 and the inflammatory marker TNF-α was assessed.Our findings indicate that GLP-1 and blood glucose levels were unaffected by omega-3 fatty  supplementation, however, animals that were fed fish or flaxseed oil-supplemented diets had significantly heightened colonic FFAR4 and actin expression, and reduced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α compared to animals fed control diets.These results suggest that similar to ingestion of other fats, dietary-intake of omega-3 fatty acids can alter FFAR4 expression within the colon.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27633106>Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Oxylipins in Neuroinflammation and Management of Alzheimer Disease.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is becoming one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative conditions worldwide. Although the disease progression is becoming better understood, current medical interventions can only ameliorate some of the symptoms but cannot slow disease progression. Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the advancement of this disorder, and n-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are involved in both the reduction in and resolution of . These effects may be mediated by the anti-inflammatory and proresolving effects of bioactive lipid mediators (oxylipins) derived from n-3 PUFAs [eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)] in fish oil. Although interventions have generally used fish oil containing both EPA and DHA, several studies that used either EPA or DHA alone or specific oxylipins derived from these fatty acids indicate that they have distinct effects. Both DHA and EPA can reduce neuroinflammation and cognitive decline, but EPA positively influences mood disorders, whereas DHA maintains normal brain structure. Fewer studies with a plant-derived n-3 PUFA, α-, suggest that other n-3 PUFAs and their oxylipins also may positively affect AD. Further research identifying the unique anti-inflammatory and proresolving properties of oxylipins from individual n-3 PUFAs will enable the discovery of novel disease-management strategies in AD.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8894803>Inhibition by lecithin-bound iodine (LBI) of inducible allergen-specific T lymphocytes' responses in allergic diseases.</a></h2><p>In atopic patients, allergen-sensitized T lymphocytes specifically proliferate in the presence of T cell-growth factor, interleukin 2 (IL-2).

It has been revealed that α- (ALA), a plant-based essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, reduces adipose tissue lipolysis. However, it is not known whether G0S2 is implicated in ALA-induced inhibition of lipolysis. The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the effect of ALA on G0S2 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of obese patients and the potential influence of G0S2 gene expression in ALA-induced inhibition of lipolysis.A total of 26 obese patients were randomly assigned to be treated with or without ALA treatment (~4.0 g daily) for 12 weeks: the ALA-treated group (n = 14) or the untreated control group (n = 12). Plasma triglyceride (TG), free fatty acids (FFA), glycerol, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well as the mRNA expression levels of proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), G0S2, and G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) in PBMC were repeatedly examined from fasting obese patients before and after ALA treatment.ALA significantly decreased plasma TG, FFA, glycerol, IL-6, and TNF-α levels and increased the mRNA expression levels of PPAR-γ, G0S2, and GPR120 in PBMC, compared with the untreated control group. In obese patients from the ALA-treated group, decreased plasma FFA (a biomarker for lipolysis) level was significantly correlated with increased PPAR-γ (a functional omega-3 fatty acids receptor) and G0S2 (a direct target gene of PPAR-γ) mRNA expression in PBMC, while decreased plasma FFA level was not correlated with increased GPR120 (another functional omega-3 fatty acids receptor) mRNA expression in PBMC.This study shows that ALA increases G0S2 gene expression in PBMC in parallel with the decrease of plasma FFA level in obese patients.

Since these cellular parameters can play an important role in the cellular response to organic and inorganic pollutants, a variation of the PUFA supply might modify the toxicity induced by such xenobiotics. In this work, we investigated whether the cellular fatty  profile has an impact on the in vitro cell sensitivity to two environmental pollutants: methylmercury and cadmium. Firstly, the fatty  composition of the rainbow trout liver cell line RTL-W1 was modified by enriching the growth medium with either  (ALA, 18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n-3), docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3), linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6), arachidonic  (AA, 20:4n-6) or docosapentaenoic  (DPA, 22:5n-6). These modified cells and their control (no PUFA enrichment) were then challenged for 24h with increasing concentrations of methylmercury or cadmium. We observed that (i) the phospholipid composition of the RTL-W1 cells was profoundly modulated by changing the PUFA content of the growth medium: major modifications were a high incorporation of the supplemented PUFA in the cellular phospholipids, the appearance of direct elongation and desaturation metabolites in the cellular phospholipids as well as a change in the gross phospholipid composition (PUFA and monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) levels and n-3/n-6 ratio); (ii) ALA, EPA and DPA enrichment significantly protected the RTL-W1 cells against both methylmercury and cadmium; (iv) DHA enrichment significantly protected the cells against cadmium but not methylmercury; (v) AA and LA enrichment had no impact on the cell tolerance to both methylmercury and cadmium; (vi) the abundance of 20:3n-6, a metabolite of the n-6 biotransformation pathway, in phospholipids was negatively correlated to the cell tolerance to both methylmercury and cadmium.

However, there are scant data regarding the relationships of the visceral fat area (VFA) with the plasma fatty  profiles and desaturase activities following weight loss. We investigated the effect of weight loss with mild calorie restriction on the circulating fatty  profiles and desaturase activities in nondiabetic overweight subjects with high VFA.Eighty overweight subjects with high VFA (L4 VFA ≥100 cm) were randomized into the 12-week mild-calorie-restriction (300 kcal/day) or control groups.Comparison of the percent of body weight changes between groups revealed that the weight-loss group had greater reductions in body weight. The VFA decreased by 17.7 cm from baseline in the weight-loss group (P < 0.001). At follow-up, the weight-loss group showed greater reductions in serum triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR than the control group. Significantly greater reductions in total saturated fatty acids, palmitic , stearic , total monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , oleic , eicosadienoic , and dihomo-γ- levels were detected in the weight-loss group compared with the control group after adjusting for baseline values.

The NVU is comprised of endothelial cells that are interconnected by  resting on a parenchymal basement membrane ensheathed by pericytes, smooth muscle cells and a layer of astrocyte end feet. Circulating blood cells, such as leukocytes, complete the NVU. BBB disruption is common in several neurological diseases, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. We analyzed the role of TWIK-related potassium channel-1 (TREK1, encoded by KCNK2) in human and mouse endothelial cells and the BBB. TREK1 was downregulated in endothelial cells by treatment with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Blocking TREK1 increased leukocyte transmigration, whereas TREK1 activation had the opposite effect. We identified altered mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling, actin remodeling and upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules as potential mechanisms of increased migration in TREK1-deficient (Kcnk2(-/-)) cells. In Kcnk2(-/-) mice, brain endothelial cells showed an upregulation of the cellular adhesion molecules ICAM1, VCAM1 and PECAM1 and facilitated leukocyte trafficking into the CNS. Following the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by immunization with a myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG)35-55 peptide, Kcnk2(-/-) mice showed higher EAE severity scores that were accompanied by increased cellular infiltrates in the central nervous system (CNS).

A phytochemical analysis showed that CAL contain phenolic  (10.4 mg·g-1 dry matter [DM]; high in rosmarinic ), flavonoids (2.6 mg·g-1 DM), diterpenes (2 mg·g-1 DM), and  (35.4 g (100 g)-1 FA). This study aimed to investigate the effect of CAL on ruminal methanogenesis and biohydrogenation as well as basic fermentation characteristics and microbial populations. The in vitro experiment was carried out using Hohenheim gas test system with 40 mL of buffered ruminal fluid incubated for 24 h at 39 °C in anaerobic conditions. Approximately 400 mg (DM basis) of total mixed ration (TMR) was used as a control substrate and the CAL substrate was used at doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg DM replacing equal amounts of TMR. Addition of CAL decreased methane production up to 30% linearly as the amount of CAL increased (P < 0.05). In vitro dry matter digestibility and ammonia tended to increase with increasing doses of CAL. Concentration of total  was not affected by the CAL although there appeared to be a minor positive linear trend; however, acetate, butyrate, and isobutyrate proportion increased quadratically (P < 0.001).

In total, 77,482 unique sequences were obtained from approximately 34 million reads. Of these, 48,466 (57.46%) sequences were annotated based on BLASTs performed against public databases. We identified 5,206 DEGs between the C and M5 samples, including genes related to the α-lenolenic  degradation pathway, JA signaling pathway, and gentiopicroside biosynthesis.

We then compared their nutrient intake with that of a similar group of concurrent participants on self-selected habitual diets but abstaining from walnut consumption (control). No recipes or advice on use of nuts were provided. Dietary intake was assessed by multiple unannounced 24-h telephone dietary recalls.

Forty-four lactating German Holstein cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods composed of 13 d of adaptation to diets followed by an 8-d sampling phase. Experimental diets offered as total mixed ration consisted of a constant forage-to-concentrate ratio (75:25) with target proportions of RCS to maize silage of 15:60 (RCS), 30:45 (RCS), 45:30 (RCS), and 60:15 (RCS) on a dry matter basis. Increasing the level of RCS in the diet was accompanied by a reduction of linoleic  content in the diet and decreased linearly the proportions of linoleic  in the milk up to 4%. Proportions of α- in milk increased 2-fold with RCS compared with RCS, which resulted from the linear increase in α- intake with incremental levels of RCS. Vaccenic  in the milk  was reduced by 24%. Rumenic , a conjugated linoleic  (cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic ) considered to be a human health promoter, was also decreased by 22%. Reduced rumenic  in the milk  was probably due to a reduced amount of vaccenic  produced in the rumen and, consequently, to the low amount of vaccenic  to be desaturated to rumenic  in the mammary gland by Δ-desaturase. Oleic  was enriched in the milk , although the dietary concentration of oleic  decreased. Stearic  proportions remained constant with increasing levels of RCS. The proportions of total polyunsaturated FA were increased by 12%, and the long-chain FA proportions increased linearly with increasing levels of RCS. Myristic  was reduced linearly, but palmitic  remained constant. Saturated FA was reduced linearly by 2%. Branched-chain FA, which are presumed to possess anticarcinogenic properties, were reduced to a small extent only (quadratic effect). We conclude that replacing maize silage with RCS appears to alter milk FA composition by reducing linoleic  intake and ruminal biohydrogenation. Feeding RCS represents a strategy to increase intake of α- in dairy cows. However, because changes in the FA profile show positive as well as negative effects, no distinct conclusions can be drawn with regard to human health benefits.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Squalene, a natural triterpene and an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, is known to have active  scavenging activities. Squalane, synthesized by complete hydrogenation of squalene, does not have active  scavenging activities. We examined the effects of oral administration of squalene or squalane on a PD mouse model, which was developed by intracerebroventricular injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Squalene administration 7 days before and 7 days after one 6-OHDA injection prevented a reduction in striatal dopamine (DA) levels, while the same administration of squalane enhanced the levels.

A further study of the underlying mechanisms for ROS-dependent cell death induced by PUFAs will lead to the discovery of a new target for cancer therapy or diagnosis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, the role of oxylipins produced by the 9-LOX pathway in this process remains largely unknown. Here we cloned a gene encoding a chloroplast-localized 9-LOX, Osr9-LOX1, from rice. Transcriptional analysis revealed that herbivore infestation, mechanical wounding and jasmonic  (JA) treatment either repressed or did not enhance the level of Osr9-LOX1 transcripts at early stages but did at later stages, whereas salicylic  (SA) treatment quickly increased the transcript level of Osr9-LOX1. Antisense expression of Osr9-lox1 (as-r9lox1) decreased the amount of wound-induced (Z)-3-hexenal but increased levels of striped stem borer (SSB)-induced , JA, SA and trypsin protease inhibitors. These changes were associated with increased resistance in rice to the larvae of the SSB Chilo suppressalis. In contrast, although no significant differences were observed in the duration of the nymph stage or the number of eggs laid by female adults between the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens that fed on as-r9lox1 lines and BPH that fed on wild-type (WT) rice plants, the survival rate of BPH nymphs that fed on as-r9lox1 lines was higher than that of nymphs that fed on WT plants, possibly because of a higher JA level. The results demonstrate that Osr9-LOX1 plays an important role in regulating an herbivore-induced JA burst and cross-talk between JA and SA, and in controlling resistance in rice to chewing and phloem-feeding herbivores.© 2014 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28013387>Cardiovascular function during supine rest in endurance-trained males with New Zealand blackcurrant: a dose-response study.</a></h2><p>Blackcurrant contains anthocyanins that could alter cardiovascular function and reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

(LT) muscle samples from the M group had a higher intramuscular fat (IMF) ( < 0.05), pHvalue ( < 0.01), and ash ( < 0.05) than the PG group. In contrast, the shear force ( < 0.05), L*( < 0.05), and b* ( < 0.001) in M group were lower than in PG group. Analyses indicated that PG group contained higher  (C18:3n3) and docosatrienoic  (C22:3n6) ( < 0.05) than the M group. Major  compounds in the muscles included hexanal, heptanal, nonanal, octanal, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octen-3-ol, and 2,3-octanedione. The levels of hexanal, nonanal, and 2,3-octanedione were significantly lower in PG lamb muscle ( < 0.01). In contrast, 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol levels were higher in M lamb muscle ( < 0.01). Muscle from PG lamb exhibited higher catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity ( < 0.05). PG muscle also contained a higher radical-scavenging ability (RSA;  < 0.001) and cupric-reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC;  < 0.05). Overall, the improved antioxidant status in PG muscle inhibited lipid peroxidation (aldehydes and ketones), thereby improving the meat quality.© 2019 The Authors.

Little is known about ROS reduction through the application of exogenous scavengers. In this study, C60 fullerol, a free radical scavenger, was foliar applied to three-week-old cucumber plants (1 or 2 mg/plant) before exposure to copper ions (5 mg/plant). Results showed that C60 fullerols augmented Cu toxicity by increasing the influx of Cu ions into cells (170% and 511%, respectively, for 1 and 2 mg of C60 fullerols/plant). We further use metabolomics and proteomics to investigate the mechanism of plant response to C60 fullerols. Metabolomics revealed that C60 fullerols up-regulated antioxidant metabolites including 3-hydroxyflavone, 1,2,4-benzenetriol, and methyl trans-cinnamate, among others, while it down-regulated cell membrane metabolites ( and palmitoleic ). Proteomics analysis revealed that C60 fullerols up-regulated chloroplast proteins involved in water photolysis (PSII protein), light-harvesting (CAB), ATP production (ATP synthase), pigment fixation (Mg-PPIX), and electron transport ( Cyt b6f). Chlorophyll fluorescence measurement showed that C60 fullerols significantly accelerated the electron transport rate in leaves (13.3% and 9.4%, respectively, for 1 and 2 mg C60 fullerols/plant). The global view of the metabolic pathway network suggests that C60 fullerols accelerated electron transport rate, which induced ROS overproduction in chloroplast thylakoids.

Their topical application in eye drops to deliver fatty  (FA) directly to the ocular surface requires thorough investigation. Being lipids in nature EFAs can interact with tear lipids and affect tear stability. This study aimed at investigating the biophysical interactions of EFAs with Meibomian lipids.Rheology of mixtures of Human Meibomian lipids with EFAs (LA-linoleic , ALA-), OA (oleic ), and GLA (gamma-) was studied using Langmuir trough technology on an artificial tear solution at the ocular surface temperature. Pressure-area profiles were used to determine compressibility and elasticity of the mixed films.LA enhanced spreading of Meibomian lipids and increased their compressibility and elasticity which can be beneficial for tear stability. ALA condensed Meibomian lipids film with less elasticity deemed unfavourable for tear stability. OA expanded Meibomian lipids but decreased elasticity at high compressions making films less stable. GLA had little or no favourable effect on tear stability. Higher concentrations of FAs made films less stable.EFAs or OA in topical ophthalmic preparations can affect spread and stability of the tear film lipid layer. Rheology of mixed films should be tested using Langmuir trough technology to determine suitable type and amount of a lipid additive for therapeutic eye drops.

However, evidence regarding plant-based α- (ALA), the major n-3 PUFA in the Western diet, remains equivocal. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of lifelong exposure to plant- or marine-derived n-3 PUFAs on pubertal mammary gland and tumor development in MMTV-neu(ndl)-YD5 mice. It is hypothesized that lifelong exposure to n-3 PUFA reduces terminal end buds during puberty leading to delayed tumor onset, volume and multiplicity. It is further hypothesized that plant-derived n-3 PUFAs will exert dose-dependent effects. Harems of MMTV-FVB males were bred with wild-type females and fed either a (1) 10% safflower (10% SF, n-6 PUFA, control), (2) 10% flaxseed (10% FS), (3) 7% safflower plus 3% flaxseed (3% FS) or (4) 7% safflower plus 3% menhaden (3% FO) diet. Female offspring were maintained on parental diets. Compared to SF, 10% FS and 3% FO reduced (P<.05) terminal end buds at 6 weeks and tumor volume and multiplicity at 20 weeks. A dose-dependent reduction of tumor volume and multiplicity was observed in mice fed 3% and 10% FS. Antitumorigenic effects were associated with altered HER2, pHER-2, pAkt and Ki-67 protein expression. Compared to 10% SF, 3% FO significantly down-regulated expression of genes involved in eicosanoid synthesis and . From this, it can be estimated that ALA was 1/8 as potent as EPA+DHA. Thus, marine-derived n-3 PUFAs have greater potency versus plant-based n-3 PUFAs.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Feeding rodents diets rich in fish oil has been shown to decrease lymphocyte proliferation and natural killer cell activity. It is not known what level of EPA + DHA is required in the diet to exert these effects. This question was addressed in the current study. Weanling rats were fed on high fat (178 g/kg) diets which contained 4.4 g  (control) or 4.4 g EPA + DHA (4.4 EPA + DHA) or 6.6 g EPA + DHA (6.6 EPA + DHA)/100 g total fatty acids. The n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  ratio was maintained at approximately 7. The fatty  compositions of the serum and of spleen leukocytes were markedly influenced by that of the diet. Spleen lymphocyte proliferation in response to concanavalin A, spleen natural killer cell activity and PGE2 production by spleen leukocytes were reduced by feeding the EPA + DHA diets compared with feeding the control diet; the 4.4 and 6.6 EPA + DHA diets caused very similar reductions. The 4.4 EPA + DHA diet reduced popliteal lymph node weight following a localised graft versus host response; this response was not investigated in rats fed the 6.6 EPA + DHA diet. The reductions in lymphocyte functions and in the in vivo graft versus host response caused by the EPA + DHA diets were similar to those previously reported following the feeding of diets rich in fish oil. Thus, this study shows that diets containing relatively low levels of EPA + DHA (20 to 25% of the level found in fish oil) exert immunomodulatory effects. Furthermore, this study suggests that the maximal effect of EPA + DHA is exerted when these fatty acids constitute a level of less than or equal to 4.4 g/100 g total dietary fatty acids.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30014926>Physiological and molecular genetic studies on two elicitors for improving the tolerance of six Egyptian soybean cultivars to cotton leaf worm.</a></h2><p>Cotton leaf worm (Spodoptera littoralis) is considered one of the most destructive agricultural pests in Egypt.

The objective was to develop an assay to assess in vivo rates, pathways, and extent of BH of oleic (OA), linoleic (LA), and α- (ALA) acids. Each UFA was characterized in a separate experiment, each using 4 ruminally cannulated lactating Holstein cows. A single bolus consisting of 200 g of a UFA-oil [experiment 1 (EXP1): 87% OA sunflower, experiment 2 (EXP2): 70% LA safflower, and experiment 3 (EXP3): 54% ALA flaxseed] and 12 g of heptadecanoic  (C17:0) was mixed into the rumen through the fistula. Rumen digesta was collected at -1, -0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h relative to the bolus. Overall, the triglyceride boluses increased total fatty acids (FA) in the rumen from 3.9 (standard deviation = ±1.4) to 7.3% (±1.4) of rumen dry matter and enriched C17:0 from 0.4 (±0.1) to 2.5% (±0.5) of FA. The bolus enriched OA from 8.9 (±1.0) to 30.1% (±4.6) of FA in EXP1, LA from 11.1 (±1.8) to 35.9% (±5.0) of FA in EXP2, and ALA from 2.1 (±0.1) to 19.8% (±4.3) of FA in EXP3. The disappearances of C17:0, OA, LA, and ALA were fit to a single exponential decay model. The first-order rate of C17:0 rumen disappearance (turnover) was 9.1, 6.9, and 5.2%/h in EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3, respectively, and was used as a marker of FA passage. The rate of total rumen turnover of OA was 54.1%/h, LA was 60.5%/h, and ALA was 93.0%/h in EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3, respectively. Rumen concentration of all 3 UFA reached prebolus concentrations within 4 h. The calculated extent of lipolysis and initial isomerization was 85.6% for OA, 89.8% for LA, and 94.7% for ALA in EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3, respectively. Assuming that BH equals total disappearance minus passage, the rates of lipolysis and initial isomerization were 45.0, 53.6, and 87.8%/h for OA, LA, and ALA in EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3, respectively. Analysis of the data using compartmental modeling showed that the normal BH pathways proposed in the literature explained 46.0, 37.3, and 49.8% of the BH of OA, LA, and ALA in EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3, respectively. Based on the model, BH of trans C18:1 FA was the rate-limiting step to complete BH. Importantly, oils were provided as triglycerides and the reported rates represent the rate of lipolysis and BH. In conclusion, the rate of ruminal BH of OA, LA, and ALA was higher than that commonly observed in vitro, but the extent of BH was near expected values. The method developed provides a potential in vivo assay of ruminal BH for use in future experiments and modeling efforts.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Intakes of EPA and DHA are usually low, typically below those recommended. Increased intakes result in higher concentrations of EPA and DHA in blood lipids, cells and tissues. Increased content of EPA and DHA modifies the structure of cell membranes and the function of membrane proteins. EPA and DHA modulate the production of lipid mediators and through effects on cell signalling can alter the patterns of gene expression. Through these mechanisms, EPA and DHA alter cell and tissue responsiveness in a way that often results in more optimal conditions for growth, development and maintenance of health. DHA has vital roles in brain and eye development and function. EPA and DHA have a wide range of physiological roles, which are linked to certain health or clinical benefits, particularly related to CVD, cancer,  and neurocognitive function. The benefits of EPA and DHA are evident throughout the life course. Future research will include better identification of the determinants of variation of responses to increased intake of EPA and DHA; more in-depth dose-response studies of the effects of EPA and DHA; clearer identification of the specific roles of EPA, docosapentaenoic  and DHA; testing strategies to enhance delivery of n-3 fatty acids to the bloodstream; and exploration of sustainable alternatives to fish-derived very long-chain n-3 fatty acids.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27619894>n-3 Fatty acids preserve muscle mass and insulin sensitivity in a rat model of energy restriction.</a></h2><p>In obese subjects, the loss of fat mass during energy restriction is often accompanied by a loss of muscle mass. The hypothesis that n-3 PUFA, which modulate protein homoeostasis via effects on insulin sensitivity, could contribute to maintain muscle mass during energy restriction was tested in rats fed a high-fat diet (4 weeks) rich in 18 : 1 n-9 (oleic , OLE-R), 18 : 3 n-3 (α-, ALA-R) or n-3 long-chain (LC-R) fatty  and then energy restricted (8 weeks). A control group (OLE-ad libitum (AL)) was maintained with AL diet throughout the study. Rats were killed 10 min after an i.v. insulin injection. All energy-restricted rats lost weight and fat mass, but only the OLE-R group showed a significant muscle loss. The Gastrocnemius muscle was enriched with ALA in the ALA-R group and with LC-PUFA in the ALA-R and LC-R groups. The proteolytic ubiquitin-proteasome system was differentially affected by energy restriction, with MAFbx and muscle ring finger-1 mRNA levels being decreased in the LC-R group (-30 and -20 %, respectively). RAC-α serine/threonine-protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation levels increased in the LC-R group (+70 %), together with insulin receptor mRNA (+50 %). The ALA-R group showed the same overall activation pattern as the LC-R group, although to a lesser extent. In conclusion, dietary n-3 PUFA prevent the loss of muscle mass associated with energy restriction, probably by an improvement in the insulin-signalling pathway activation, in relation to enrichment of plasma membranes in n-3 LC-PUFA.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'insulin resistance', 'metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25910408>Reduction in the desaturation capacity of the liver in mice subjected to high fat diet: Relation to LCPUFA depletion in liver and extrahepatic tissues.</a></h2><p>α- (ALA) and linoleic (LA) acids are precursors of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), FAs with important biochemical and physiological functions. In this process, desaturation reactions catalyzed by Δ5- and Δ6-desaturase play a major role, enzymes that are subjected to hormonal and dietary regulation. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of a high fat diet (HFD) on activity of liver Δ5 and Δ6 desaturases, in relation to LCPUFA composition in liver and extrahepatic tissues. Male C57BL/6J mice received control diet (CD) (10% fat, 20% protein and 70% carbohydrate) or high fat diet (HFD) (60% fat, 20% protein, and 20% carbohydrate) for 12 weeks. After this time, blood and liver samples were taken for metabolic, morphologic, inflammatory, oxidative stress and desaturase activity assessment, besides FA phospholipid analysis in erythrocytes, heart, adipose tissue and brain. HFD significantly increased hepatic total fat, triacylglycerides and free FA content with macrovesicular steatosis and oxidative stress enhancement, concomitantly with higher fasting serum glucose and  levels, HOMA, and serum cholesterol, triacylglycerols, TNF-α, and IL-6. Diminution in liver Δ5- and Δ6-desaturase activities and LCPUFA depletion were induced by HFD, the later finding being also observed in extrahepatic tissues. In conclusion, HFD-induced reduction in the bioavailability of liver LCPUFA is associated with defective desaturation of ALA and LA, with Δ5- and Δ6-desaturase activities being correlated with  development.

Primary cells were isolated from the mammary glands of Holstein dairy cows and were passaged twice. Afterward, the cells were randomly allocated to six treatments, five UFA-treated groups, and one control group. For all of the treatments, the the fetal bovine serum in the culture solution was replaced with fatty -free BSA (1 g/L), and the cells were treated with different ratios of oleic, linoleic, and  acids (0.75:4:1, 1.5:10:1, 2:13.3:1, 3:20:1, and 4:26.7:1) for 48 h, which were group 1 to group 5. The control culture solution contained only fatty -free BSA without UFAs (0 μM). The results indicated that the cell viability was not affected by adding different ratios of UFAs, but the accumulation of TAG was significantly influenced by supplementing with different ratios of UFAs. Adding different ratios of UFAs suppressed the expression of ACACA and FASN but had the opposite effect on the abundances of FABP3 and CD36 mRNA. The expression levels of PPARG, SPEBF1, CSN1S1, and CSN3 mRNA in the BMECs were affected significantly after adding different ratios of UFAs. Our results suggested that groups 1, 2, and 3 (0.75:4:1, 1.5:10:1, and 2:13.3:1) had stronger auxo-action on fat synthesis in the BMECs, where group 3 (2:13.3:1) was the best, followed by group 4 (3:20:1). However, group 5 (4:26.7:1) was the worst. Genes related to protein synthesis in the BMECs were better promoted in groups 2 and 3, and group 3 had the strongest auxo-action, whereas the present study only partly examined the regulation of protein synthesis at the transcriptional level; more studies on translation level are needed in the future. Therefore, when combining fat and protein synthesis, group 3 could be obviously fat and protein synthesis in the BMECs concurrently.

The onset time of convulsion following cerebral hemorrhage was recorded, and the areas of hemorrhage and infarction were analyzed in the stroke brains.In comparison with 58-day survival of SHR-SP rats during feeding NaCl alone, perilla oil extended the survival time to 68.5 days, whereas canola oil shortened it to 45.7 days. Feeding perilla oil greatly reduced the total volume of cerebral hemorrhage from 17.27% in the control group to 4.53%, while shortening increased the lesions to 21.23%. In a microscopic analysis, perilla oil also markedly decreased the hemorrhagic and infarction lesions to 1/10 of those in control rats, in contrast to an exacerbating effect of shortening. In blood analyses, perilla oil reduced blood total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins which were increased in SHR-SP, but canola oil further increased them and markedly lowered platelet counts.Perilla oil delayed and attenuated cerebral hemorrhage by improving hyperlipidemia in hypertensive stroke animals, in contrast to the aggravating potential of canola oil and shortening.

A companion article provides a comprehensive review of extra-virgin olive oil. The benefits of consumption of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids are described. Fresh fish provides eicosapentaenoic  while α- is found in canola and soybean oils, purslane and nuts. These ω-3 fatty acids interact metabolically with ω-6 fatty acids mainly linoleic  from corn oil, sunflower oil and peanut oil.

In addition, the differential expression of the fungal genes was profiled. The study revealed the complexity of the interaction between the fungus and peanut seeds as the expression of a large number of genes was altered, including some in the process of plant defense to aflatoxin accumulation. Analysis of the experimental data with "keggseq," a novel designed tool for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis, showed the importance of α- metabolism, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, spliceosome, and carbon fixation and metabolism pathways in conditioning resistance to aflatoxin accumulation.

Recent studies have demonstrated an inverse association between nut consumption and incidence of colon cancer; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. An emerging concept suggests that microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) may help explain the relationship between walnut consumption and decreased colorectal neoplasia risk. Seven days after HT-29 colon cancer cell injection, mice were randomized to either control or walnut diets for 25 days of diet treatment. Thirty samples of tumor and of omental adipose were analyzed to determine changes in lipid composition in each dietary group. In the tumors of the walnut-containing diet, we found significant increases in α-, eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic and total omega-3 acids, and a decrease in arachidonic , as compared to the control diet. Final tumor size measured at sacrifice was negatively associated with percentage of total omega-3 fatty  composition (r=-0.641, P=.001). MicroRNA expression analysis of colorectal tumor tissue revealed decreased expression of miRNAs 1903, 467c and 3068 (P<.05) and increased expression of miRNA 297a* (P=.0059) in the walnut-treated group as compared to control diet. Our results indicate that changes in the miRNA expression profiles likely affect target gene transcripts involved in pathways of anti-inflammation, antivascularization, antiproliferation and apoptosis. We also demonstrate the incorporation of protective fatty acids into colonic epithelium of walnut-fed mice, which may independently alter miRNA expression profiles itself.

The concentrations of α- increased by 18 mol% in both SC and PR in non-TMR steers compared to TMR steers (P < 0.01). trans 18:1 isomers were more concentrated in PR than SC (14.4 vs 9.5 mol%; P < 0.01) and increased by 10 mol% in both fat depots for non-TMR (P < 0.01). Other BHI including non-methylene-interrupted 18:2 (atypical dienes), conjugated linoleic acids and conjugated  acids (CLnA) were affected by diet × tissue interactions (P < 0.01).

Sprague Dawley rats were fed a total western diet with (TWD + ) or without DHA (TWD-) along with a commercial rodent chow control (Chow) throughout pregnancy and postpartum. The fatty  compositions of adipose, brain, heart, liver, erythrocytes, and plasma were determined before pregnancy, at 15 and 20 days of pregnancy, and 7 days postpartum. The placenta, fetuses, and pups were also examined when available. Maternal DHA concentrations were increased in plasma at 20 days pregnancy in all the diets with TWD + > Chow > TWD-. Maternal DHA concentrations in the TWD- group were lower in adipose throughout pregnancy as compared with the other diets. At postpartum, DHA concentrations decreased below baseline levels in the heart of the TWD- and Chow dams and the liver of the TWD- dams. Whole body DHA concentrations of the fetuses did not differ but there was evidence of decreased DHA in the whole body and tissues of the TWD- and Chow 7d old pups.

This raises questions since a recent study including ALA has suggested to divide the historical value by four. However, this recent study has remained inconclusive because the animals used were not totally LA-deficient animals. For the first time, the present study was especially designed using physiological and biochemical markers and performed in two steps: (1) to achieve a specific n-6 fatty  deficiency model using growing male rats fed either a 0 en% from LA/0 en% from ALA (0LA/0ALA), 0LA/0·5ALA or 2LA/0·5ALA diet, born from female rats fed a 0LA/0·5ALA diet; and (2) to refine the required level of LA in the presence of ALA using rats fed either a 0LA/0ALA, 0·5LA/0·5ALA, 1LA/0·5ALA, 1·5LA/0·5ALA diet, born from female rats fed a 0LA/0·5ALA diet. The first step shows that the best LA deficiency model was obtained using rats fed the 0LA/0ALA diet, born from female rats fed the 0LA/0·5ALA diet. The second step demonstrates that in growing rats, LA deficiency was corrected with an intake of 1-1·5 en% from LA and 0·5 en% from ALA.

However, the pharmacological mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD has not been clearly elucidated and needs to be further explored.We aimed to identify relevant biological pathways by assessing changes in biomarkers in response to DLT intervention in CHD to reveal the potential biological mechanism of DLT treatment for CHD.The major chemical components in DLT were qualitatively analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS), and a model of CHD in rats was subsequently established with a high-fat diet and left anterior coronary artery ligation (LADCA) followed by DLT intervention. Next, the metabolic profile of rat serum samples was analyzed using nontargeted metabolomics, wherein changes in the metabolites in serum samples before and after DLT administration were measured by PLS-DA, and two pathways of DLT treatment for CHD were predicted. Finally, predicted metabolomic pathways were verified by detecting and analyzing tissues from the rat model, revealing the mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD.Forty-five major chemical components were identified by the chemical characterization of DLT. In terms of metabolism, 17 biomarkers of CHD in rats were identified. Among these biomarkers, linoleic , γ- and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) were found to play an important role in energy metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Protein analysis revealed that EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited in CHD rats after DLT treatment, which lowered the expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and MMP9, decreased the expression levels of ox-LDL and MDA, and increased the expression of SOD.The mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD involves inhibiting the expression of EGFR and the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway by regulating glycerophospholipid metabolism (LPCs) and energy metabolism (linoleic  and γ-). Therefore, -related (TNF-α, IL-6, MMP9) and oxidative stress-related (ox-LDL, MDA, SOD) indicators are affected, leading to the regulation of the oxidative stress state and anti-inflammatory effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Preclinical studies have identified over 1000 molecules with brain-protective properties. More than 200 clinical trials have evaluated neuroprotective candidates for ischemic stroke yet, to date almost all failed, leading to a re-analysis of treatment strategies against stroke. An emerging view is to seek combinatory therapy, or discovering molecules able to stimulate multiple protective and regenerative mechanisms. A pertinent experimental approach to identify such candidates is the study of brain preconditioning, which refers to how the brain protects itself against ischemia and others stress-inducing stimuli. The recent discovery that nutrients like  (ALA is an essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  required as part of our daily diet), may be an efficient brain preconditionner against stroke fosters the novel concept of brain preconditioning by nutraceuticals. This review stresses the underestimated role of nutrition in preventing and combating stroke. Although there is a consensus that increased consumption of salt, fatty foods and alcoholic beverages may promote pathologies like hypertension,  and alcoholism - all of which are well known risk factors of stroke - few risk factors are attributed to a deficiency in an essential nutrient in the diet. The ALA deficiency observed in the Western modern diets may itself constitute a risk factor. This review outlines how ALA supplementation by modification of the daily diet prevented mortality and cerebral damage in a rodent model of ischemic stroke. It also describes the pleiotropic ability of ALA to trigger responses that are multicellular, mechanistically diverse, resulting in neuronal protection, stimulation of neuroplasticity, and brain artery vasodilation. Overall, this review proposes a promising therapeutic opportunity by integrating a nutritional-based approach focusing on enriching the daily diet in ALA to prevent the devastating damage caused by stroke.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

After a 3-month habitual diet period, dietary fats were partly replaced with PUFAs for another 3 months. The PUFA-rich diet increased plasma linoleic  from 28.36 +/- 1.00% to 33.76 +/- 1.08% (P < 0.002) and  from 0.52 +/- 0.03% to 1.06 +/- 0.10% (P < 0.0001). Fasting glucose increased from 76 +/- 3 to 95 +/- 3 mg/dl (4.2 +/- 0.2 to 5.30.2 mmol/liter; P < 0.0001), and the area under the curve for glucose during oral glucose tolerance test increased from 421 +/- 34 to 503 +/- 31 mg/dl (23.4 +/- 1.9 to 27.9 +/- 1.7 mmol/liter; P < 0.001). Plasma insulin did not change either at fasting or during oral glucose tolerance test. Fasting plasma free fatty acids decreased from 0.596 +/- 0.048 to 0.445 +/- 0.058 mg/dl (P = 0.037), and ketone bodies decreased from 9.14 +/- 1.57 to 3.63 +/- 0.62 mg/dl (895 +/- 154 to 356 +/- 61 micromol/liter; P < 0.003). Plasma 15-deoxyprostaglandin J(2) tended to decrease (from 239 +/- 65 to 171 +/- 60 ng/ml; P = 0.053). Plasma testosterone, free testosterone, SHBG, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, LH, FSH, and urinary estrogen conjugates did not change. Urinary pregnanediol 3-glucuronide increased from 18.6 +/- 2.2 to 31.0 +/- 5.7 micro g/mg creatinine (P = 0.038).

Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) provides the staple food with serving as main source of  and protein. Germination of sorghum generally increases the nutritive value of seeds and the effects of germination on lipids composition of seeds vary greatly with processing conditions. Therefore, the current study was conducted to compare the effect of emerging processing techniques such as ultrasound (US) and microwave (MW) on fatty acids composition and oil yield of sorghum seeds before and after germination.Initially sorghum grains were soaked with 5% NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite) for surface sterilization. Afterwards, grains were soaked in excess water for 22 h at room temperature and were divided into four portions. The first portion (100 g grains) was subjected to germination without applying any microwave and ultrasonic treatment (T). Second portion was further divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group) and grains were subjected to ultrasonic treatments using two different ultrasonic intensities (US: 40%; US: 60%) within range of 0-100% and with two different time durations (t: 5 min; t: 10 min) at constant temperature. Third portion was also divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group) and exposed to microwave treatments at two different power levels (MW: 450 watt; MW: 700 watt) within the range of 100-900 W for two different time durations (t: 15 s; t: 30s). Similarly, fourth portion was divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group). Each group was exposed to both MW (MW, MW) (100-900 watt power) & US (US, US) (0-100% intensity) treatments at two different time levels (t, t). Then, germination was carried out and pre-treated raw and pre-treated germinated sorghum grains were analyzed for total oil yield, fatty  composition and unsaturated fatty acids (Un-SFA)/saturated fatty acids (SFA) ratio by gas chromatography.The results revealed that oil yield in sorghum before and after germination ranged from 6.55 to 7.84% and 6.28 to 7.57%, respectively. All the microwave and ultrasound processed samples showed significant difference in oil yield than the raw sorghum grains. The highest tested yield was 7.84 ± 0.31% when combination of microwave power (700 W) and ultrasound intensity (60%) was applied for 30s and 10 min, respectively. The results further demonstrate that the raw sorghum contained palmitic (13.73 ± 0.10%), palmitoleic (0.43 ± 0.02%), stearic (1.07 ± 0.04%), oleic (37.15 ± 0.10%), linoleic (43.33 ± 0.21%),  (1.55 ± 0.04%), arachidic  (0.13 ± 0.01%) and eicosenoic  (0.37 ± 0.02%), respectively. The highest fatty  percentage for palmitic, stearic and arachidic  was 13.75 ± 0.07%, 1.11 ± 0.09% and 0.15 ± 0.03% at 60% US intensity for 10 min (T), respectively. Maximum amount observed was 1.60 ± 0.09% of  while amount of eicosenoic  decreased from 0.37 ± 0.02% to 0.31 ± 0.01% after processing. In case of applying combination of microwave and sonication treatments, the change in eicosenoic  increased from 0.35 ± 0.02% to 0.40 ± 0.04% while there was no significant change in other fatty acids. The ungerminated sorghum oil possessed 14.93-15.05% and 82.83-83.12% of SFA and Un-SFA, respectively. After germination, percentage of saturated fatty acids increased (16.4-16.55%) while decreased for unsaturated fatty acids (80.13-80.56%) were noted.The results of the present study conclude that the yield of oil from sorghum grains increased by emerging processing. Fatty  analysis of sorghum oil suggested that pre-treatment strategies will not affect the quality of the oil with respect to essential fatty acids content. Overall, the composition of saturated fatty  in germinated grain is improved than ungerminated grains after processing.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804136>Bioethanol and  production from the enzymatic hydrolysate of wheat straw after furfural extraction.</a></h2><p>This study investigates biofuel production from wheat straw hydrolysate, from which furfural was extracted using a patented method developed at the Latvian State Institute of Wood Chemistry. The solid remainder after furfural extraction, corresponding to 67.6% of the wheat straw dry matter, contained 69.9% cellulose of which 4% was decomposed during the furfural extraction and 26.3% lignin. Enzymatic hydrolysis released 44% of the glucose monomers in the cellulose. The resulting hydrolysate contained mainly glucose and very little amount of acetic . Xylose was not detectable. Consequently, the undiluted hydrolysate did not inhibit growth of yeast strains belonging to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lipomyces starkeyi, and Rhodotorula babjevae.

Conversion of α- (ALA) to DHA is considered adequate to support brain function in youth, but it is unknown if brain DHA can be maintained in  resistant states. This study investigated brain fatty  and desaturase activities in young  resistant Zucker rats on diets with and without DHA. Male fa/fa and lean rats were fed diets enriched with flaxseed (FXO, ALA: 35.5% fatty acids), menhaden (MO, DHA: 9.2%) or safflower oil (SO, linoleic : 54.1%) for 9 weeks, n=8 per diet per genotype. Compared to lean, the 15 week old fa/fa rats were obese (56% heavier) and -resistant (>18-fold in homeostasis model assessment of ). The forebrain of fa/fa rats had higher palmitoleic (16:1n-7) and dihomo-γ- (20:3n-6) acids, and higher Δ9, Δ6 but lower Δ5 (all P≤.006) desaturase indices than lean. The Δ9 and Δ6 desaturase indices positively, while the Δ5 negatively (all P≤.01) correlated with . The Δ9 desaturase index positively correlated with adiposity index. The percentage of forebrain DHA of fa/fa rats was lower (P=.011) than lean rats when fed FXO diet while there was no difference (P>.05) between fa/fa and lean rats fed MO or SO diet. Thus, the alterations in the fatty  and desaturase indices in the brain were consistent inhibited forebrain synthesis of DHA in the fa/fa rats.

To enable the exploration of inhibitors of octanoylated ghrelin production, we developed a cell-based assay system using AGS-GHRL8 cells, in which octanoylated ghrelin concentration increases in the presence of octanoic . Using this assay system, we investigated whether fatty acids contained in foods or oils, such as acetic , stearic , oleic , linoleic , and α-, have inhibitory effects on octanoylated ghrelin production. Acetic  did not suppress the increase in octanoylated ghrelin production in AGS-GHRL8 cells, which was induced by the addition of octanoic . However, stearic , oleic , linoleic , and α- significantly suppressed octanoylated ghrelin production, with the effect of oleic  being the strongest. Additionally, oleic  decreased the serum concentration of octanoylated ghrelin in mice. The serum concentration of des-acyl ghrelin (without acyl modification) was also decreased, but the decrease was smaller than that of octanoylated ghrelin. Decreased octanoylated ghrelin production likely resulted from post-translational ghrelin processing, as there were no significant differences in gene expression in the stomach between oleic -treated mice and controls. These results suggest that oleic  is a potential inhibitor of octanoylated ghrelin production and that our assay system is a valuable tool for screening compounds with suppressive effects on octanoylated ghrelin production.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25411528>Direct exposure of non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma confers simultaneous oxidative and ultraviolet modifications in biomolecules.</a></h2><p>Thermal plasmas and lasers are used in medicine to cut and ablate tissues and for coagulation. Non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma (NEAPP) is a recently developed, non-thermal technique with possible biomedical applications. Although NEAPP reportedly generates reactive /nitrogen species, electrons, positive ions, and ultraviolet radiation, little research has been done into the use of this technique for conventional free radical biology. Recently, we developed a NEAPP device with high electron density. Electron spin resonance spin-trapping revealed (•)OH as a major product. To obtain evidence of NEAPP-induced oxidative modifications in biomolecules and standardize them, we evaluated lipid peroxidation and DNA modifications in various in vitro and ex vivo experiments. Conjugated dienes increased after exposure to linoleic and α- acids. An increase in 2-thiobarbituric -reactive substances was also observed after exposure to phosphatidylcholine, liposomes or liver homogenate. Direct exposure to rat liver in saline produced immunohistochemical evidence of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal- and acrolein-modified proteins. Exposure to plasmid DNA induced dose-dependent single/double strand breaks and increased the amounts of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. These results indicate that oxidative biomolecular damage by NEAPP is dose-dependent and thus can be controlled in a site-specific manner.

EFAD may occur in patients with conditions that severely limit the intake, digestion, absorption, and/or  of . EFAD may be prevented in patients requiring parenteral nutrition by inclusion of an intravenous  emulsion (ILE) as a source of LA and ALA. Early ILEs consisted solely of soybean oil (SO), a good source of LA and ALA, but being rich in LA may promote the production of proinflammatory fatty acids. Subsequent ILE formulations replaced part of the SO with other  sources to decrease the amount of proinflammatory fatty acids. Although rare, EFAD is diagnosed by an elevated triene:tetraene (T:T) ratio, which reflects increased  of oleic  to Mead  in the absence of adequate LA and ALA. Assays for measuring fatty acids have improved over the years, and therefore it is necessary to take into account the particular assay used and its reference range when determining if the T:T ratio indicates EFAD. In patients with a high degree of suspicion for EFAD, obtaining a fatty  profile may provide additional useful information for making a diagnosis of EFAD. In patients receiving an ILE, the T:T ratio and fatty  profile should be interpreted in light of the fatty  composition of the ILE to ensure accurate diagnosis of EFAD.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19793338>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ameliorate the severity of ileitis in the senescence accelerated mice (SAM)P1/Yit mice model.</a></h2><p>Clinical studies using omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega3-PUFA) to Crohn's disease (CD) are conflicting. Beneficial effects of dietary omega3-PUFA intake in various experimental inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models have been reported. However, animal models of large intestinal inflammation have been used in all previous studies, and the effect of omega3 fat in an animal model of small intestinal inflammation has not been reported. We hypothesized that the effects of omega3 fat are different between large and small intestine.

Neither STA nor its derivative 20 : 4n-3 appeared in PBMC when STA (<1.0 g/d) was consumed. However, STA (1.0 g/d), in combination with GLA (0.9 g/d), increased the proportion of EPA in PBMC. None of the treatments altered neutrophil or monocyte phagocytosis or respiratory burst, production of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes, T lymphocyte proliferation or the delayed-type hypersensitivity response. Production of cytokines by T lymphocytes increased in all groups, with no differences among them. The proportion of lymphocytes that were natural killer cells decreased significantly in subjects receiving 2.0 g EPA or GLA/d. There were no other effects on lymphocyte sub-populations. Plasma IgE concentration decreased in most groups, but not in the control group. Plasma IgG2 concentration increased in the EPA group. Thus, EPA or GLA at a dose of 2.0 g/d have little effect on key functions of neutrophils, monocytes and T lymphocytes, although at this dose these fatty acids decrease the number of natural killer cells. At this dose EPA increases IgG2 concentrations.

Given that TLR4 is closely related to atherosclerosis, we hypothesized herein that caprylic  (C8:0) would suppress  via TLR4/NF-κB signaling and further promote the amelioration of atherosclerosis in apoE- deficient (apoE) mice.Fifty 6-week male apoE mice were randomly allocated into five diet groups: a high-fat diet (HFD) without or with 2% caprylic  (C8:0), capric  (C10:0), stearic  (C18:0), or  (C18:3). RAW246.7 cells were treated with caprylic  (C8:0), docosahexenoic  (DHA), palmitic  (C16:0), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without TLR4 knock-down (TLR4-KD). The serum lipid profiles, inflammatory biomolecules, and mRNA and protein expression levels were measured. Atherosclerotic lesions that occurred in the aorta and aortic sinuses were evaluated and quantified.Our results indicated that C8:0 reduced body fat, improved the lipid profiles, suppressed inflammatory cytokine production, downregulated aortic TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, TNF-α, IKKα, and IKKβ mRNA expression, and alleviated atherosclerosis in the apoE mice ( < 0.05). In RAW 264.7 cells, C8:0 diminished the inflammatory response and both mRNA and protein expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, and TNF-α compared to those in the LPS and C16:0 groups ( < 0.05). However, in the TLR4-KD RAW 264.7 cells, C8:0 significantly upregulated NF-κB mRNA and protein expression compared to those in the C16:0 and DHA groups.These results suggest that C8:0 functions via TLR4/NF-κB signaling to improve the outcomes of apoE mice through suppressing  and ameliorating atherosclerosis.

More than 31 BPH-resistance genes have been located, and several of them have been isolated. Nevertheless, the metabolic mechanism related to BPH-resistance genes remain uncharacterized.To elucidate the resistance mechanism of the BPH-resistance gene Bph6 at the metabolic level, a Bph6-transgenic line R6 (BPH-resistant) and the wild-type Nipponbare (BPH-susceptible) were used to investigate their  profiles under control and BPH treatments.In conjunction with multivariate statistical analysis and quantitative real-time PCR, BPH-induced  changes in leaf blade and leaf sheath were investigated by GC-MS-based lipidomics.Forty-five lipids were identified in leaf sheath extracts. Leaf sheath lipidomics analysis results show that BPH infestation induces significant differences in the  profiles of Nipponbare and R6. The levels of hexadecanoic , methyl ester, linoleic , methyl ester, , methyl ester, glycidyl palmitate, eicosanoic , methyl ester, docosanoic , methyl ester, beta-monolinolein, campesterol, beta-sitosterol, cycloartenol, phytol and phytyl acetate had undergone enormous changes after BPH feeding. These results illustrate that BPH feeding enhances sterol biosynthetic pathway in Nipponbare plants, and strengthens wax biosynthesis and phytol  in R6 plants. The results of quantitative real-time PCR of 5 relevant genes were consistent with the changes in metabolic level. Forty-five lipids were identified in the leaf blade extracts. BPH infestation induces distinct changes in the  profiles of the leaf blade samples of Nipponbare and R6. Although the  changes in Nipponbare are more drastic, the changes within the two varieties are similar.  profiles in leaf sheath brought out significant differences than in leaf blade within Nipponbare and R6. We propose that Bph6 mainly affects the levels of lipids in leaf sheath, and mediates resistance by deploying metabolic re-programming during BPH feeding.The results indicate that wax biosynthesis, sterol biosynthetic pathway and phytol  play vital roles in rice response to BPH infestation. This finding demonstrated that the combination of lipidomics and quantitative real-time PCR is an effective approach to elucidating the interactions between brown planthopper and rice mediated by resistance genes.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25207475>Low n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in newly diagnosed celiac disease in children with preexisting type 1 .</a></h2><p>Fat malabsorption can occur in celiac disease (CD) owing to villus atrophy and inflammation of small intestinal mucosa.

Previously we found significantly reduced availability of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) in children and young adults with type 1  (DM). The aim of this study was to investigate FAs in plasma lipid classes in children with newly diagnosed CD with or without preexisting DM.FA composition of plasma samples of children with untreated CD only (n = 20) and with preexisting DM (CDDM, n = 8) were compared with those of healthy controls (n = 21). Detailed analysis of phospholipid, triacylglycerol, and sterol ester FAs was performed by high-resolution capillary gas-liquid chromatography.Significantly decreased docosapentaenoic (C22:5n-3), docosahexaenoic (C22:6n-3), n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), and n-3 LCPUFA values were found in CDDM group compared with controls and patients with CD. When compared with healthy controls, no significant difference was found in plasma FAs of children with newly diagnosed CD only.Children with CDDM showed marked signs of reduced availability of n-3 PUFA and n-3 LCPUFA in circulating lipids. Although different tissues express membrane FAs differently, our present study suggests that CD on its own does not necessarily lead to detectable disturbances of essential FA metabolism in plasma and supports the concept that DM has significant impact on plasma FA composition in children.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323448>Effect of moisture on wheat grains  patterns and infection with Fusarium graminearum.</a></h2><p>Suitable conditions of temperature and humidity are required to maintain wheat grains quality, but during processing and storage, the grains can be exposed to adverse environmental conditions and presence of infectious fungi. Fusarium graminearum, the main causal agent of Fusarium head blight on wheat, affects crop yields and grain quality by alteration of their biochemical components and mycotoxin contamination, which reduces the possibilities of wheat end use and compromises food safety.  degradation by hydrolytic, oxidative and microbial deterioration is the predominant cause of the loss of sensory acceptability, nutritional value and baking quality. The aim of this research was to determine the influence of adverse environmental conditions -as the increasing moisture - on  patterns of whole wheat flours contaminated with F. graminearum in relation to the infection degree. In vitro cultures of F. graminearum were carried out on wheat grains under different degrees of relative humidity (11, 50, 75 and 100%) throughout 45 days of incubation at 28 °C. The fungal biomass measured by q-PCR increased proportionally with the humidity. A decrease in the signals of saturated (palmitic and estearic) and unsaturated (oleic, linoleic and ) fatty acids, analyzed as fatty  methyl esters (FAMEs) by GC-MS, was observed in relation with the humidity and infection degree. The degradation rate of the lipids was high during the first 15 days of incubation, reaching the fatty acids content, values around 20-40% of those found in the control. From that moment on, the rate of degradation was slower or even null. It was observed that in all treatments, the  reached the highest degradation ratio in comparison with the other fatty acids, which may be caused by the action of lipoxygenases. The lipase activity and the content of deoxynivalenol were also determinate on the flours. The lipase activity increased until day 25 of incubation reaching twice the initial value. The deoxynivalenol content also increased along incubation while fatty acids decreased. Our results demonstrated that the magnitude in the signal of fatty acids in whole wheat flours varied in relation to the degree of humidity and fungal infection of the grains from which they were obtained. Otherwise, lipids and their oxidation products are related with the pathogenesis and production of mycotoxins. These observations highlight the importance of an adequate manipulation of wheat grains on the processing chain to prevent quality changes and mycotoxins contamination.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It also contains fatty acids and vitamins essential for growth, development, and maintenance of good health. Dietary fat quantity and quality have been subject to tremendous change over the past 10,000 years. This has, together with other man-made changes in our environment, caused a conflict with our slowly adapting genome that is implicated in “typically Western” diseases. Rather than reducing our life expectancy, these diseases notably diminish our number of years in health. Important changes in dietary fat quality are the increased intakes of certain saturated fatty acids (SAFA) and linoleic  (LA), introduction of industrially produced  fatty acids, and reduced intakes of ω3 fatty acids, notably  (ALA) from vegetable sources and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) from fish. The pathophysiological effects of these changes are diverse, but are increasingly ascribed to induction of a proinflammatory state that progresses easily to chronic low-grade inflammation. The latter might affect virtually all organs and systems, possibly beginning at conception, and possibly even prior to gametogenesis through epigenetic alterations. Low-grade inflammation might be a common denominator of the  and its sequelae (e.g., coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2, some types of cancer, and pregnancy complications), some psychiatric diseases (e.g., major and postpartum depression, schizophrenia, and autism), and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease). The long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) arachidonic  (AA), EPA, and DHA are intimately related to the initiation and resolution of inflammatory responses. The current balance between AA and EPA + DHA is however disturbed by the dominance of AA, which originates from the diet or synthesis from LA. LCPUFA are together with their highly potent metabolites (prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, resolvins, and (neuro)protectins) involved in the functioning of membrane-bound receptors, transporters, ion channels, and enzymes, and also in signal transduction and gene expression. Among their many targets are nuclear receptors which, upon ligation with LCPUFA and their metabolites, function as transcription factors of a variety of genes functioning in many pathways. For instance, the targeted peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (PPARs) are strategic intermediates in the coordinated expression of proteins with functions in, for example, lipid and glucose homeostasis and inflammatory reactions. Many interventions have been conducted with LCPUFA, especially EPA and DHA, aiming at primary and secondary CAD preventions, improvement of fetal and newborn (brain) development by supplementation during pregnancy or early postnatal life, and in psychiatric diseases. Consensus has been reached that those in CAD and depression are positive, although more large-scale trials are needed. Many recommendations for the intakes of saturated fat,  fat and EPA + DHA have been issued, notably for CAD prevention, and also for EPA + DHA intakes by pregnant women and for AA, EPA, and DHA intakes by newborns. The ultimate goal might, however, be to return to the fat quality of our ancient diet on which our genes have evolved during the past million years of evolution, while this actually applies for our entire dietary composition and lifestyle, as translated to the culture of the current society.Copyright © 2010, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9507239>Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids alter rat spleen leukocyte fatty  composition and prostaglandin E2 production but have different effects on lymphocyte functions and cell-mediated .</a></h2><p>Weanling rats were fed on high-fat (178 g/kg) diets which contained 4.4 g  (ALA), gamma-, arachidonic (ARA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), or docosahexaenoic  (DHA)/100 g total fatty acids. The proportions of all other fatty acids, apart from linoleic , and the proportion of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (approximately 35 g/100 g total fatty acids) were constant, and the n-6 to n-3 PUFA ratio was maintained as close to 7 as possible. The fatty  compositions of the serum and of spleen leukocytes were markedly influenced by that of the diet. Prostaglandin E2 production was enhanced from leukocytes from rats fed the ARA-rich diet and was decreased from leukocytes from the EPA- or DHA-fed rats. Replacing dietary ALA with EPA resulted in diminished ex vivo lymphocyte proliferation and natural killer (NK) cell activity and a reduced cell-mediated immune response in vivo. In contrast, replacing ALA with DHA reduced ex vivo lymphocyte proliferation but did not affect ex vivo NK cell activity or the cell-mediated immune response in vivo. Replacement of a proportion of linoleic  with either gamma- or ARA did not affect lymphocyte proliferation, NK cell activity, or the cell-mediated immune response. Thus, this study shows that different n-3 PUFA exert different immunomodulatory actions, that EPA exerts more widespread and/or stronger immunomodulatory effects than DHA, that a low level of EPA is sufficient to influence the immune response, and that the immunomodulatory effects of fish oil may be mainly due to EPA.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24005871>Dietary conjugated α- did not improve glucose tolerance in a neonatal pig model.</a></h2><p>There is an increased interest in the benefits of conjugated α- (CLNA) on obesity-related complications such as  and diabetes.

Our results have shown that HPOs are able to interact with PPM lipids and perturb their lateral organization. Glucosylceramide (GluCer) is a privileged partner, sitosterol lessens their binding and the presence of both GluCer and sitosterol further reduces their interaction. Hydrophobic effect and polar interactions are involved in the binding. The chemical structure of HPOs influences their affinity for PPM lipids. The presence of three double bonds in the HPO molecule gives rise to a higher affinity comparatively to two double bonds, which can be explained by their differential interaction with the  polar headgroups.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study hypothesized that the function of TJs in human breast cancer cells can be augmented by gamma  (GLA), selenium (Se), and iodine (I) in the presence of 17-beta-estradiol, as these molecules are known to increase TJ functions in endothelial cells, using assays of trans-epithelial resistance (TER), PCP, immunofluorescence, and in vitro invasion and motility models. GLA, I, and Se individually increased TER of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The combination of all three agents also had a significant increase in TER. Addition of GLA/Se/I reduced PCP of both breast cancer cell lines. GLA/Se/I reversed the effect of 17-beta-estradiol (reduced TER, increased PCP). Immunofluorescence revealed that after treatment with Se/I/GLA over 24 h, there was increasing relocation to breast cancer cell-cell  of occludin and ZO-1 in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, treatment with GLA/Se/I, alone or in combination, significantly reduced in vitro invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells through an endothelial cell barrier (P < 0.0001) and reduced 17-beta-estradiol induced breast cancer cell motility (P < 0.0001). Our previous work has demonstrated that GLA, I, and Se alone, or in combination are able to strengthen the function of TJs in human endothelial cells; this has now proved to be true of human breast cancer cells.

The current meta-analysis and meta-regression was undertaken to assess the overall effect of different forms of flax, as a source of trienoic (cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3) fatty acids (FA), on lactation performance and on transfer efficiency of its constituent n-3 FA from diet to milk fat. Comparisons were first conducted with nonsupplemented controls or with diets containing either saturated (mainly 16:0 or 18:0 or both), monoenoic (mainly cis-9 18:1), or dienoic (mainly cis-9,cis-12 18:2) FA. Results indicate that supplementing flax seed and oil decreased dry matter intake, as well as actual and -corrected milk yield without affecting the efficiency of utilization of dietary dry matter or  as compared with nonsupplemented iso-energetic controls. When compared with the other 3 types of dietary fat evaluated, flax rich in trienoic FA supported a yield of -corrected milk similar to supplements rich in saturated, monoenoic, or dienoic FA. Greater milk fat concentration and feed efficiency were observed with saturated supplements. However, milk fat concentration and yield were lower with dienoic FA than with flax supplements. Further analyses were conducted to compare the effect of different forms of flax oil, seed, or fractions of seed. Among the 6 categories evaluated, mechanically processed whole seed (rolled or ground) allowed the greatest yield of -corrected milk and the best feed efficiency when compared with free oil, intact or extruded whole seed, protected flax, and flax hulls. Feeding protected flax and flax hulls allowed the greatest milk fat concentration of cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3. Moreover, the greatest transfer efficiencies of this fatty  from diet to milk were recorded with the same 2 treatments, plus the mechanically processed whole seed. These results make this last category the most suitable treatment, among the 6 flax forms evaluated, to combine optimum lactation performance and protection of flax constituent cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3.The Authors.

The purpose of this research was to monitor in detail the goat milk fatty  (FA) profile during the first 24 h after linseed oil (LO) supplementation or suppression in the diet. Particular emphasis was placed in the changes of FA with bioactive properties. Milk  was analysed by gas chromatography from milkings at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after diet shift.The α- levels increased 12 h after LO incorporation in the diet and decreased 3 h after oil suppression. Most of the milk 10:0 to 16:0 saturated FA decreased 24 h after LO supplementation, whereas oil suppression raised their levels after 6 h. Similarly, raising of mono- and polyunsaturated trans-FA after LO inclusion was delayed in comparison with their decrease after oil suppression.This study supports that ruminal bacteria and mammary glands would exhibit a fast responsiveness after the inclusion or suppression of LO in ruminant rations. Milk with an improved FA profile could be collected between 12 h after LO supplementation and the last milking before LO suppression in the diet. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/619975>The nutritional and  impact of gamma- (18:3omega6) on cats deprived of animal lipid.</a></h2><p>1.

Although most studies have focussed on the predominant omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oils (eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic ), recent evidence suggests similar health benefits from their common precursor, stearidonic . Stearidonic  is a Delta6-unsaturated C18 omega-3 fatty  present in a few plant species (mainly the Boraginaceae and Primulaceae) reflecting the general absence of Delta6-desaturation from higher plants. Using a Delta6-desaturase from Primula vialii, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis and linseed lines accumulating stearidonic  in their seed lipids. Significantly, the P. vialiiDelta6-desaturase specifically only utilises  as a substrate, resulting in the accumulation of stearidonic  but not omega-6 gamma-. Detailed lipid analysis revealed the accumulation of stearidonic  in neutral lipids such as triacylglycerol but an absence from the acyl-CoA pool. In the case of linseed, the achieved levels of stearidonic  (13.4% of triacylglycerols) are very similar to those found in the sole natural commercial plant source (Echium spp.) or transgenic soybean oil. However, both those latter oils contain gamma-, which is not normally present in fish oils and considered undesirable for heart-healthy applications. By contrast, the stearidonic -enriched linseed oil is essentially devoid of this fatty . Moreover, the overall omega-3/omega-6 ratio for this modified linseed oil is also significantly higher. Thus, this nutritionally enhanced linseed oil may have superior health-beneficial properties.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30203512>Dietary Unsaturated Fatty Acids Modulate Maternal Dyslipidemia-Induced DNA Methylation and Histone Acetylation in Placenta and Fetal Liver in Rats.</a></h2><p>The present study assessed the role of dietary unsaturated fatty acids in maternal dyslipidemia-induced DNA methylation and histone acetylation in placenta and fetal liver and accumulation of lipids in the fetal liver. Weanling female Wistar rats were fed control and experimental diets for 2 months, mated, and continued on their diets during pregnancy. At gestation days of 18-20, rats were euthanized to isolate placenta and fetal liver. DNA methylation, DNA methyl transferase-1 (DNMT1) activity, acetylation of histones (H2A and H2B), and histone acyl transferase (HAT) activity were evaluated in placenta and fetal liver. Fetal liver  accumulation and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) were assessed. Maternal dyslipidemia caused significant epigenetic changes in placenta and fetal liver. In the placenta, (1) global DNA methylation increased by 37% and DNMT1 activity by 86%, (2) acetylated H2A and H2B levels decreased by 46% and 24% respectively, and (3) HAT activity decreased by 39%. In fetal liver, (1) global DNA methylation increased by 52% and DNMT1 activity by 78%, (2) acetylated H2A and H2B levels decreased by 28% and 26% respectively, and (3) HAT activity decreased by 37%. Maternal dyslipidemia caused a 4.75-fold increase in fetal liver triacylglycerol accumulation with a 78% decrease in DNA-binding ability of PPAR-α.

Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its antioxidative features, this compound in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic  and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from oxidation. Both compounds preserved  and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis () leaves against lipid peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic  and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid peroxidation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation of lipids, carnosic  was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic  is a chemical quencher of ROS. The antioxidative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid peroxidation, contrary to carnosic . Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic , rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic  were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic , confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic  takes place in planta.© 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

CAN manifests in a spectrum of things, ranging from resting tachycardia and fixed heart rate (HR) to development of "silent" myocardial infarction. Clinical correlates or risk markers for CAN are age, DM duration, glycemic control, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (DLP), development of other microvascular complications. Established risk factors for CAN are poor glycemic control in type 1 DM and a combination of hypertension, DLP, , and unsatisfactory glycemic control in type 2 DM. Symptomatic manifestations of CAN include sinus tachycardia, exercise intolerance, orthostatic hypotension (OH), abnormal blood pressure (BP) regulation, dizziness, presyncope and syncope, intraoperative cardiovascular instability, asymptomatic myocardial ischemia and infarction. Methods of CAN assessment in clinical practice include assessment of symptoms and signs,  based on HR and BP, short-term electrocardiography (ECG), QT interval prolongation, HR variability (24 h, classic 24 h Holter ECG), ambulatory BP monitoring, HR turbulence, baroreflex sensitivity, muscle sympathetic nerve activity, catecholamine assessment and cardiovascular sympathetic tests, heart sympathetic imaging. Although it is common complication, the significance of CAN has not been fully appreciated and there are no unified treatment algorithms for today. Treatment is based on early diagnosis, life style changes, optimization of glycemic control and management of cardiovascular risk factors. Pathogenetic treatment of CAN includes: Balanced diet and physical activity; optimization of glycemic control; treatment of DLP; antioxidants, first of all α-lipoic  (ALA), aldose reductase inhibitors, acetyl-L-carnitine; vitamins, first of all fat-soluble vitamin B1; correction of vascular endothelial dysfunction; prevention and treatment of thrombosis; in severe cases-treatment of OH.

While evidence suggests that high PUFA intake can impact hypothalamic activity, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulated by essential dietary n-6 and n-3 PUFA (i.e., linoleic  and α-, respectively) remain poorly described in this brain region. To differentiate the roles of essential dietary PUFA on hypothalamic function, we fed male rats high- diets (35% kcal/d) containing either safflower (linoleic ) or flaxseed (α-) oil for 2 months. Control rats were fed a low- (16% kcal/d) diet containing soybean oil. Hypothalamic fatty acids and gene expression were investigated by gas chromatography and microarray, respectively. Safflower-fed rats had higher total n-6 PUFA content due to increases in linoleic , arachidonic , and osbond  compared to the other diet groups, while flaxseed-fed rats had higher total n-3 content due to increases in α-, eicosapentaenoic , docosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic . Safflower-fed rats showed augmented expression of genes related to hypothalamic insulin signalling compared to controls. This was mirrored by significant increases in phosphorylated AKT and AKT levels; indicative of increased PI(3)K/AKT pathway activity. These changes were not observed in the hypothalamus of flaxseed-fed rats. Our findings provide new molecular insights into how essential fatty acids influence the hypothalamus and, potentially, whole-body energy homeostasis.

However, their specific metabolic effects compared with standard dairy in a high-fat diet (HFD) context remain largely unknown; this is what we determined in the present study with a focus on the metabolic and intestinal parameters. The experimental animals were fed for 12 weeks a HFD containing 20 % fat in the form of a pasture dairy cream (PDC) or a standard dairy cream (SDC). Samples of plasma, liver, white adipose tissue, duodenum, jejunum and colon were analysed. The PDC mice, despite a higher food intake, exhibited lower fat mass, plasma and hepatic TAG concentrations, and inflammation in the adipose tissue than the SDC mice. Furthermore, they exhibited a higher expression of hepatic PPARα mRNA and adipose tissue uncoupling protein 2 mRNA, suggesting an enhanced oxidative activity of the tissues. These results might be explained, in part, by the higher amounts of ALA in the PDC diet and in the liver and adipose tissue of the PDC mice. Moreover, the PDC diet was found to increase the proportions of two strategic cell populations involved in the protective function of the intestinal , namely Paneth and goblet cells in the small intestine and colon, compared with the SDC diet. In conclusion, a PDC HFD leads to improved metabolic outcomes and to a stronger  barrier compared with a SDC HFD.

Intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence techniques showed structural instability of the enzyme in concomitance with a decrease in the regular secondary structure acquired using CD spectrometry. This data clearly prove that the new derivatives show a stronger inhibitory effect than the separate compounds. Molecular docking analysis showed that the best possible interaction condition was achieved for chrysin with n-6. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: MT is a suitable model in medicine for the investigation of melanogenesis, skin disorders, and hyperpigmentation because of its accessibility and close structural similarity to mammalian tyrosinase. In recent years, the designing of tyrosinase inhibitors from natural substances for prevention of hyperpigmentation in medicine, skin cosmetics, and undesired browning in agriculture and food industry has risen sharply. Many of the pharmaceutical products based on the use of flavonoids and poly unsaturated acids as natural compounds or on their semi-synthetic derivatives have been interested for investigations because of their usefulness in many pathological conditions such as , cancer, and skin disorders. The limitation of the flavonoids applications are low bioavailability, permeability, and solubility for the cells. In this study, conjugation of chrysin with n-3 and n-6 fatty acids resulted in a stronger inhibitors of MT with a synergic inhibitory effect on its activity.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28916975>Flaxseed Oil Supplementation Improve Gene Expression Levels of PPAR-γ, LP(a), IL-1 and TNF-α in Type 2 Diabetic Patients with Coronary Heart Disease.</a></h2><p>This study was carried out to determine the effects of flaxseed oil administration on gene expression levels related to insulin, lipid and  in overweight diabetic patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted among 60 diabetic patients with CHD. Subjects were randomly allocated into two groups to intake either 1000 mg n-3 fatty  from flaxseed oil containing 400 mg α- [ALA (18:3n-3)] (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) twice a day for 12 weeks. Gene expression related to insulin, lipid and  were quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of diabetic patients with CHD with RT-PCR method. Results of RT-PCR demonstrated that after the 12-week intervention, compared with the placebo, flaxseed oil supplementation could up-regulate gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) (P = 0.02) in PBMC of diabetic patients with CHD. In addition, compared with the placebo, taking flaxseed oil supplements down-regulated gene expression levels of lipoprotein(a) [LP(a)] (P = 0.001), interleukin-1 (IL-1) (P = 0.001) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (P = 0.02) in PBMC of diabetic patients with CHD. We did not observe any significant effect of flaxseed oil supplementation on gene expression levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), IL-8 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in PBMC of diabetic patients with CHD. Overall, flaxseed oil supplementation for 12 weeks in diabetic patients with CHD significantly improved gene expression levels of PPAR-γ, LP(a), IL-1 and TNF-α, but did not influence LDLR, IL-8 and TGF-β.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21063737>A role for PPARα in the regulation of arginine metabolism and nitric oxide synthesis.</a></h2><p>The pleiotropic effects of PPARα may include the regulation of amino  metabolism. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key player in vascular homeostasis. NO synthesis may be jeopardized by a differential channeling of arginine toward urea (via arginase) versus NO (via NO synthase, NOS). This was studied in wild-type (WT) and PPARα-null (KO) mice fed diets containing either saturated fatty acids (COCO diet) or 18:3 n-3 (LIN diet).  markers of arginine metabolism were assayed in urine and plasma. mRNA levels of arginases and NOS were determined in liver. Whole-body NO synthesis and the conversion of systemic arginine into urea were assessed by using (15)N(2)-guanido-arginine and measuring urinary (15)NO(3) and [(15)N]-urea. PPARα deficiency resulted in a markedly lower whole-body NO synthesis, whereas the conversion of systemic arginine into urea remained unaffected. PPARα deficiency also increased plasma arginine and decreased citrulline concentration in plasma. These changes could not be ascribed to a direct effect on hepatic target genes, since NOS mRNA levels were unaffected, and arginase mRNA levels decreased in KO mice. Despite the low level in the diet, the nature of the fatty acids modulated some effects of PPARα deficiency, including plasma arginine and urea, which increased more in KO mice fed the LIN diet than in those fed the COCO diet. In conclusion, PPARα is largely involved in normal whole-body NO synthesis.

Multiple stepwise regression models revealed that baPWV was significantly influenced by systolic blood pressure, age, body weight, triglyceride and LA in serum phospholipids (R(2) = 0.378). Interestingly, baPWV (1419 ± 1 cm/s) and MetS (22%) were highest in individuals with lower proportion of LA (< 12.361%) and higher proportion of DGLA (≥ 1.412%) in serum phospholipid FAs.The features of MetS significantly related to serum phosopholipid FA composition. Particularly, arterial stiffness was associated with LA additively together with DLGA.

To test the hypothesis that the fatty  (FA) compositions differ between Sri Lankan and Japanese populations and that high concentrations of n-3 polyunsaturated FAs and linoleic  are associated with a low level of arteriosclerosis, the authors compared the circulating FA compositions between Sri Lankan and Japanese populations and examined the association of the circulating FA composition with arterial stiffness in each population. The study participants were patients with diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hypertension in Sri Lanka (n = 100) or Japan (n = 236). Serum FA compositions were measured by gas chromatography. Arterial stiffness was measured using the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI). Analysis of covariance was used to compare the FA compositions between the populations. Multiple regression was used to assess the association between each FA and CAVI levels. The concentrations of myristic, γ-, dihomo-γ-, and arachidonic acids were higher in the Sri Lankan patients than in the Japanese patients. In contrast, the concentrations of linoleic, α-, and eicosapentaenoic acids were higher in the Japanese patients than in the Sri Lankan patients. Although no associations of n-3 polyunsaturated FAs and linoleic  with CAVI were observed in both patient populations, odd-chain saturated FAs (pentadecanoic and heptadecanoic acids) were significantly inversely associated with CAVI levels in the Sri Lankan (P for trend = .03) but not the Japanese patients.

In this study, we aimed to characterize the plasma phospholipid fatty  profile for PCOS patients with and without IR, as well as for the early prognosis of PCOS and its IR complication. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) followed by multivariate statistical analysis was established to globally characterize the phospholipid fatty  profiles in plasma from non-IR PCOS, IR PCOS, and eligible healthy controls, and subsequently discovered fatty  biomarkers. A total of 22 fatty acids were identified and quantified. Their proportions varied among three groups, suggesting each group has its own fatty  pattern. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) according to their fatty  profiles showed that 29 tested samples could be clearly differentiated according to groups. More importantly, nervonic  (C24:1 n-9) and dihomo-γ- (C20:3 n-6) were identified as the potential fatty  biomarkers of PCOS and its IR complication, respectively, for their most contribution to group separation. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that C24:1 n-9 and C20:3 n-6 were well correlated with clinical characteristics of PCOS and IR indicators, respectively.

Another HFD group additionally received ChOi from 90 to 135 d.Consumption of ChOi reduced fat mass accumulation and increased lean mass as evidenced by nuclear magnetic resonance. Moreover, obese mice treated with ChOi showed higher tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, greater activation of protein kinase B, and increased translocation of glucose transporter type 4 in skeletal muscle tissue in response to insulin. ChOi supplementation improved glucose levels and insulin tolerance; decreased serum insulin, leptin, and triacylglycerols; and increased blood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. All these effects caused by the use of ChOi seemed to be independent of the resolution of inflammation because the markers of inflammation were not altered in animals fed the HFD.The molecular effects observed in muscle tissue together with changes in body composition may have contributed to the increased glucose tolerance and to the healthy phenotype presented by obese animals treated with ChOi.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Sixty 4-month-old castrated male Albas white cashmere kids (average BW 18.6 ± 0.1 kg) were randomly allocated among three dietary treatments: (i) basal diet without supplementation (Control), (ii) basal diet supplemented with linseed oil (LSO), (iii) basal diet supplemented with heated linseed grain (HLS). The concentrate:forage ratio was 5:5 and the LSO and HLS treatments provided the kids with similar dietary FA profiles. The diets were fed for 104 d, consisting of 14 d for adaptation followed by 90 d of experimental observation. Treatment did not significantly influence BW, DMI, or bacterial richness or diversity. On the other hand, the relative abundance of bacteria participating in hydrogenation differed significantly among the three groups: the Veillonellaceae and Christensenellaceae were more abundant in LSO kids, Prevotellaceae were more abundant in HLS kids, and the Fibrobacteriaceae were more abundant in Control kids (P < 0.05). Spearman correlation analysis indicated that Ruminobacter, Selenomonas_1, Fretibacterium, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, Succinimonas, and Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group were the genera that participated in hydrogenation of long-chain FAs. HLS-fed kids had a lower relative abundance of Ruminobacter, but a higher abundance of Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 and Fretibacterium than LSO-fed kids. These changes were associated with greater rumen concentrations of C18:3n3 and n-3 PUFA, but lower concentrations of n-6 PUFA and lower n-6/n-3 ratios, in HLS than in LSO-fed kids.

Since then, new findings have been published regarding the relationship between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, including supplementation, and cardiovascular health.A literature search was undertaken in PubMed and Medline, for literature published between January 1, 2007 and August 31, 2013.A total of eight research questions were developed and, using the National Health and Medical Research Council's evidence assessment framework, conclusions were made in relation to dietary intake of fish and omega-3 LCPUFA for cardiovascular health. In the evidence published since 2007, this summary of evidence concludes that dietary intake of fish was found to be mostly consistent with respect to protection from heart disease and stroke. Higher fish intake was associated with lower incident rates of heart failure in addition to lower sudden cardiac death, stroke and myocardial infarction. In relation to omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation, neither a beneficial nor adverse effect was demonstrated in primary or secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD).

Lipotoxicity to the pancreatic beta cells is considered to be a major underlying cause for this phenomenon.

Toxicity after a 2-day incubation with the different FFAs was analysed by the caspase-3 assay and confirmed by the propidium iodide and annexin V staining tests. The long-chain saturated PA (C16:0) and the monounsaturated OA (C18:1) were both toxic to human EndoC-βH1 beta cells and pseudoislets, as well as to rat islets, and, as confirmed in a pilot experiment, also to human islets. Furthermore, OA provided no protection against the toxicity of PA. Likewise, elaidic  (EA, the trans isomer of OA; trans-OA) was significantly toxic, in contrast to the non-metabolisable analogues methylated PA (MePA) and methylated OA (MeOA). Fatty acids with a chain length  < C16 were not toxic in EndoC-βH1 beta cells. Caspase-3 was also activated by linoleic  (LA)(C18:2) but not by γ- (γ-LNA)(C18:3). Overall, only long-chain FFAs with chain lengths  > C14, which generate hydrogen peroxide in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation, were toxic. This conclusion is also supported by the toxicity of the branched-chain FFA pristanic , which is exclusively metabolised in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation.

The control group consisted of nine healthy subjects. All subjects underwent an oral standard fat load. Triglycerides; cholesterol; FFA; glucose and insulin were measured every 2 h with the determination of fatty  composition of FFA.higher serum FFA levels in NAFLD subjects are mainly due to levels of oleic, palmitic and linoleic acids at different times.

In the postprandial phase, homeostatic model assessment HOMA index positively correlated with the ω3/ω6 ratio in NAFLD patients.the higher serum levels of FFA in NAFLD subjects are mainly due to levels of oleic and palmitic acids which are the most abundant circulating free fatty acids.

Studies in human autoimmune disease have been less dramatic; however, human trials have been subject to uncontrolled dietary and genetic backgrounds, infection and other environmental influences, and basic trial designs have been inadequate. The impact of dietary fatty acids on animal autoimmune disease models appears to depend on the animal model and the type and amount of fatty acids fed. Diets low in fat, essential fatty -deficient, or high in n-3 fatty acids from fish oils increase the survival and reduce disease severity in spontaneous autoantibody-mediated disease, whilst linoleic -rich diets appear to increase disease severity. In experimentally-induced T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease, essential fatty -deficient diets or diets supplemented with n-3 fatty acids appear to augment disease, whereas n-6 fatty acids prevent or reduce the severity. In contrast, in both T-cell and antibody-mediated auto-immune disease the desaturated and elongated metabolites of linoleic  are protective. Suppression of autoantibody and T lymphocyte proliferation, apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production by high-dose fish oils are all likely mechanisms by which n-3 fatty acids ameliorate autoimmune disease. However, these could be undesirable long-term effects of high-dose fish oil which may compromise host . The protective mechanism(s) of n-6 fatty acids in T-cell- mediated autoimmune disease are less clear, but may include dihomo-gamma-- and arachidonic -sensitive immunoregulatory circuits such as Th1 responses, TGF beta 1-mediated effects and Th3-like responses. It is often claimed that n-6 fatty acids promote autoimmune and inflammatory disease based on results obtained with linoleic  only. It should be appreciated that linoleic  does not reflect the functions of dihomo-gamma- and arachidonic , and that the endogenous rate of conversion of linoleic to arachidonic  is slow (Hassam et al. 1975, 1977; Phylactos et al. 1994; Harbige et al. 1995). In addition to effects of dietary fatty acids on immunoregulation, inflammation as a consequence of immune activation in autoimmune disease may also be an important mechanism of action whereby dietary fatty acids modulate disease activity. In conclusion, regulation of gene expression, signal transduction pathways, production of eicosanoids and cytokines, and the action of antioxidant enzymes are all mechanisms by which dietary n-6 and n-3 fatty acids may exert effects on the immune system and autoimmune disease. Probably the most significant of these mechanisms in relation to our current understanding of immunoregulation and inflammation would appear to be via fatty  effects on cytokines. The amount, type and balance of dietary fatty acids and associated antioxidant nutrients appear to impact on the immune system to produce immune-deviation or immunosuppressive effects, and to reduce immune-mediated inflammation which will in turn affect the susceptibility to, or severity of, autoimmune disease.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22642555>Antioxidant activity of capsaicinoid in canola oil.</a></h2><p>Interest in replacing synthetic antioxidants, namely, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), with natural antioxidants is increasing.

To study the structure-antioxidant relationship, it was found that the trimethylsiloxy (TMS) derivatives of capsaicinoid did not exhibit any antioxidant activity, suggesting the hydroxyl moiety was the functional group responsible for the antioxidant activity of capsaicinoid.

Inhibition of PCSK9 using monoclonal antibodies can efficiently lower plasma LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein (a). PCSK9 inhibition is also an effective adjunct to statin therapy; however, the cost-effectiveness of currently available PCSK9 inhibitors is under question. Nutraceuticals offer a safe and cost-effective option for PCSK9 inhibition. Several nutraceuticals have been reported to modulate PCSK9 levels and exert LDL-lowering activity. Mechanistically, those nutraceuticals that inhibit PCSK9 through a SREBP (sterol-responsive element binding protein)-independent pathway can be more effective in lowering plasma LDL-C levels compared with those inhibiting PCSK9 through the SREBP pathway. The present review aims to collect available data on the nutraceuticals with PCSK9-inhibitory effect and the underlying mechanisms.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The results obtained from a number of experimental studies suggest that targeting different components of the inflammatory machinery may result in the improvement of the metabolic phenotype. Unsaturated fatty acids exert antiinflammatory activity through several distinct mechanisms. Here, we tested the capacity of ω3 and ω9 fatty acids, directly from their food matrix, to exert antiinflammatory activity through the G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)120 and GPR40 pathways. GPR120 was activated in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues, reverting inflammation and insulin resistance in obese mice. Part of this action was also mediated by GPR40 on muscle, as a novel mechanism described. Pair-feeding and immunoneutralization experiments reinforced the pivotal role of GPR120 as a mediator in the response to the nutrients. The improvement in insulin sensitivity in the high-fat substituted diets was associated with a marked reduction in tissue inflammation, decreased macrophage infiltration, and increased IL-10 levels. Furthermore, improved glucose homeostasis was accompanied by the reduced expression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes and reduced body mass. Thus, our data indicate that GPR120 and GPR40 play a critical role as mediators of the beneficial effects of dietary unsaturated fatty acids in the context of -induced insulin resistance.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'insulin resistance', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29579972> molecular markers of VOO Thermo-oxidation: Effect of heating processes, macronutrients composition, and olive ripeness on the new emitted aldehydic compounds.</a></h2><p>Heating operation has been applied to Chétoui extra-virgin olive oils (EVOOs) extracted from fruits with several ripening stages (RS).

In the present study, we further investigated the stimulation of the oxylipin pathway: metabolites and enzymes of the pathway were analyzed to understand the fate of the 13-HPOT in ISR. Actually the stimulation began upstream the LOX: free  accumulated faster in P. putida BTP1-treated plants than in control. Downstream, the LOX products 13-fatty  hydroperoxides esterified to galactolipids and phospholipids were more abundant in bacterized plants than in control before infection. These metabolites could constitute a pool that will be used after pathogen attack to produce free fungitoxic metabolites through the action of phospholipase A2, which is enhanced in bacterized plants upon infection. Enzymatic branches which can use as substrate the fatty  hydroperoxides were differentially regulated in bacterized plants in comparison to control plants, so as to lead to the accumulation of the most fungitoxic compounds against B. cinerea.

The effects of the bacterial mixture were assessed in gnotobiotic plant inoculation assays and compared with single and dual inoculation treatments. Triple inoculation with 3×10 bacteria significantly increased plant dry weight and leaf pigments, indicating improved photosynthetic performance.

Electrolyte leakage, an indicator of plant membrane stability under stress, was decreased pointing to a beneficial effect by inoculation. Plants physiological condition was more favoured by triple inoculation than by single, although benefits on biomass were only evident relative to non-inoculated plants.

By comparing FADS sequencing data from present-day and Bronze Age (5-3k years ago) Europeans, we identify possible targets of selection in the European population, which suggest that selection has targeted different alleles in the FADS genes in Europe than it has in South Asia or Greenland. The alleles showing the strongest changes in allele frequency since the Bronze Age show associations with expression changes and multiple lipid-related phenotypes. Furthermore, the selected alleles are associated with a decrease in linoleic  and an increase in arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids among Europeans; this is an opposite effect of that observed for selected alleles in Inuit from Greenland. We show that multiple SNPs in the region affect expression levels and PUFA synthesis. Additionally, we find evidence for a gene-environment interaction influencing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels between alleles affecting PUFA synthesis and PUFA dietary intake: carriers of the derived allele display lower LDL cholesterol levels with a higher intake of PUFAs.

Murine and human β-cells produce 20-HETE, and the ω-hydroxylase-mediated formation and release of 20-HETE is strongly stimulated by glucose. Pharmacological inhibition of 20-HETE formation and blockade of FFAR1 in islets inhibits GSIS. In islets from type-2 diabetic humans and mice, glucose-stimulated 20-HETE formation and 20-HETE-dependent stimulation of GSIS are strongly reduced. We show that 20-HETE is an FFAR1 agonist, which functions as an autocrine positive feed-forward regulator of GSIS, and that a reduced glucose-induced 20-HETE formation contributes to inefficient GSIS in type-2 .</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22112267>Comparative evaluation of manganese peroxidase- and Mn(III)-initiated peroxidation of C18 unsaturated fatty acids by different methods.</a></h2><p>The peroxidation of C18 unsaturated fatty acids by fungal manganese peroxidase (MnP)/Mn(II) and by chelated Mn(III) was studied with application of three different methods: by monitoring  consumption, by measuring conjugated dienes and by thiobarbituric -reactive substances (TBARS) formation. All tested polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were oxidized by MnP in the presence of Mn(II) ions but the rate of their oxidation was not directly related to degree of their unsaturation. As it has been shown by monitoring  consumption and conjugated dienes formation the linoleic  was the most easily oxidizable fatty  for MnP/Mn(II) and chelated Mn(III). However, when the lipid peroxidation (LPO) activity was monitored by TBARS formation the  gave the highest results. High accumulation of TBARS was also recorded during peroxidation of linoleic  initiated by MnP/Mn(II). Action of Mn(III)-tartrate on the PUFAs mimics action of MnP in the presence of Mn(II) indicating that Mn(III) ions are involved in LPO initiation. Although in our experiments Mn(III) tartrate gave faster than MnP/Mn(II) initial oxidation of the unsaturated fatty acids with consumption of O(2) and formation of conjugated dienes the process was not productive and did not support further development of LPO. The higher effectiveness of MnP/Mn(II)-initiated LPO system depends on the turnover of manganese provided by MnP. It is proposed that the  consumption assay is the best express method for evaluation of MnP- and Mn(III)-initiated peroxidation of C18 unsaturated fatty acids.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

EFAs are readily available in the diet. But, to derive their full benefit, EFAs need to be metabolized to their respective long-chain metabolites. EFAs not only form precursors to respective prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), and leukotrienes (LTs), but also give rise to lipoxins (LXs), resolvins, isoprostanes, and hydroxy- and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoates. Certain PGs, TXs, and LTs have pro-inflammatory actions whereas LXs and resolvins are anti-inflammatory in nature. Furthermore, EFAs and their long-chain metabolites modulate the activities of angiotensin converting and HMG-CoA reductase enzymes, enhance acetylcholine levels in the brain, increase the synthesis of endothelial nitric oxide, augment diuresis, and enhance insulin action. Thus, EFAs and their metabolites may function as endogenous ACE and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, nitric oxide enhancers, beta-blockers, diuretics, anti-hypertensive, and anti-atherosclerotic molecules. In addition, EFAs and their long-chain metabolites react with nitric oxide (NO) to yield respective nitroalkene derivatives that exert cell-signaling actions via ligation and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Thus, EFAs and their derivatives have varied biological actions that may have relevance to their involvement in several physiological and pathological processes.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance', 'metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30145885>Flaxseed Oil Attenuates Hepatic Steatosis and  in Mice by Rescuing the Adaption to ER Stress.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence has demonstrated the benefits of α--rich flaxseed oil (ALA-FO) against lipid metabolism abnormality in both rodent models and humans.

Concerns about high intake of n - 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are based on the premise that endogenous conversion from linoleic  (LA; 18:2 n - 6) is an important source of AA, but few population-based studies have investigated dietary determinants of AA status. In this study, we examined habitual food consumption in relation to plasma concentrations of AA and other PUFAs in population-based studies. We used cross-sectional data from 269 healthy, ethnic Chinese participants (25-80 years old) with contrasting intakes of fish and red meat from the Singapore Prospective Study Program and 769 healthy participants (44-74 years old) from the Singapore Chinese Health Study as a validation set. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine PUFA intake (% energy) and food sources of PUFA (fish, red meat, poultry, soy and cooking oils) in relation to plasma PUFAs (AA, LA, dihomo-gamma- (DGLA; 20:3 n - 6),  (ALA; 18:3 n - 3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; 20:5 n - 3), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6 n - 3)) concentrations. Higher intake of red meat was associated with higher plasma AA concentrations. High intake of PUFA or PUFA-rich oils was associated with higher plasma ALA but not with plasma AA. Higher intakes of soy were associated with higher ALA and fish with higher DHA and EPA concentrations. These associations were statistically significant (p < 0.05) in both studies. Red meat consumption, but not PUFA or PUFA-rich cooking oil, was associated with circulating AA suggesting that intake of pre-formed AA rather than LA is an important determinant of AA status. A diet high in fish, soy products and polyunsaturated cooking oil, and low in red meat may be associated with an optimal plasma profile of PUFA in this Chinese population.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26350254>α- (ALA) is an anti-inflammatory agent in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Studies suggest that consumption of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) plays a protective role in inflammatory bowel disease; however, the use of plant-derived oils rich in α- (ALA) has not been widely investigated.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can have profound effects on inflammation through the formation of bioactive oxygenated metabolites called oxylipins. The objective of this study was to determine if exposure to the dietary omega-3 PUFA α- (ALA) can dampen the inflammatory properties of classically activated (M1-like) macrophages derived from the human THP-1 cell line and to examine the accompanying alterations in oxylipin secretion. We find that ALA treatment leads to a reduction in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α production. Although ALA is known to be converted to longer-chain PUFAs eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), DHA oxylipins were reduced overall by ALA treatment, as was LPS-induced secretion of EPA oxylipins. In contrast, we observed profound increases in oxylipins directly derived from ALA. Lipoxygenase products of linoleic  were also dramatically increased, and LPS-induced production of AA oxylipins, particularly prostaglandin D2, was reduced. These results suggest that ALA may act to dampen the inflammatory phenotype of M1-like macrophages by a unique set of mechanisms distinct from those used by the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. Thus, there is strong rationale for investigating the functions of ALA oxylipins and lesser-known LA oxylipins since they hold promise as anti-inflammatory agents.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Natural products have proven historically to be a promising pool of structures for drug discovery, and a significant research effort has recently been undertaken to explore the PPARγ-activating potential of a wide range of natural products originating from traditionally used medicinal plants or dietary sources. The majority of identified compounds are selective PPARγ modulators (SPPARMs), transactivating the expression of PPARγ-dependent reporter genes as partial agonists. Those natural PPARγ ligands have different binding modes to the receptor in comparison to the full thiazolidinedione agonists, and on some occasions activate in addition PPARα (e.g. genistein, biochanin A, sargaquinoic , sargahydroquinoic , resveratrol, amorphastilbol) or the PPARγ-dimer partner retinoid X receptor (RXR; e.g. the neolignans magnolol and honokiol).

In this study, we examined the effect of ALA and its gut lactic  bacteria metabolites 13-hydroxy-9(),15()-octadecadienoic  (13-OH) and 13-oxo-9(),15()-octadecadienoic  (13-oxo) on the differentiation of M2 macrophages from bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) and investigated the underlying mechanisms. BMDCs were stimulated with ALA, 13-OH, or 13-oxo in the presence of IL-4 or IL-13 for 24 h, and significant increases in M2 macrophage markers CD206 and Arginase-1 (Arg1) were observed. In addition, M2 macrophage phenotypes were less prevalent following cotreatment with GPCR40 antagonists or inhibitors of PLC-β and MEK under these conditions, suggesting that GPCR40 signaling is involved in the regulation of M2 macrophage differentiation. In further experiments, remarkable M2 macrophage accumulation was observed in the lamina propria of the small intestine of C57BL/6 mice after intragastric treatments with ALA, 13-OH, or 13-oxo at 1 g/kg of body weight per day for 3 d. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of M2 macrophage differentiation involving fatty acids from gut lactic  bacteria and GPCR40 signaling.-Ohue-Kitano, R., Yasuoka, Y., Goto, T., Kitamura, N., Park, S.-B., Kishino, S., Kimura, I., Kasubuchi, M., Takahashi, H., Li, Y., Yeh, Y.-S., Jheng, H.-F., Iwase, M., Tanaka, M., Masuda, S., Inoue, T., Yamakage, H., Kusakabe, T., Tani, F., Shimatsu, A., Takahashi, N., Ogawa, J., Satoh-Asahara, N., Kawada, T. α--derived metabolites from gut lactic  bacteria induce differentiation of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages through G protein-coupled receptor 40.© FASEB.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9934537>The kinetics of IL-4 and IFN-gamma gene expression in mice after Trichosansin immunization.</a></h2><p>Trichosanthin (TCS) is a potent allergen to mice. According to our previous experiments, it could bring out the IgE response to ovabumin (OVA) if TCS was given one day before OVA immunization, while OVA alone could not induce IgE to it. In this work, the kinetics of interleukin 4(IL-4) and interferon gamma(IFN-gamma) gene expression in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) of TCS-immunized mice was investigated using a semi-quantitative RT-PCR method. It indicated that TCS induced significant IL-4 gene expression and the peaks of IL4 gene expression were on day one after TCS immunization in both primary and secondary response. In contrast, the IFN-gamma gene expression was suppressed. Furthermore, the IL-4 gene expression in the secondary response was lower than that in the primary response. Thus the presence of IgE memory B cells were studied. Results showed that the amount of mature IgE mRNA arose significantly and rapidly one day after TCS restimulation, while in the MLN of the mice primed 30 days before and without boost, it was almost as the same amount of the unimmunized control. These findings suggest the existence of the IgE memory B cells in the mice after the primary TCS immunization.</p><p>Keyword:['immunotherapy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9389880>Clarification of the link between polyunsaturated fatty acids and Helicobacter pylori-associated duodenal ulcer disease: a dietary intervention study.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological evidence has suggested that the declining prevalence of duodenal ulcer disease may be attributable to rising consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids, a hypothesis supported by in vitro evidence of toxicity of such substances to Helicobacter pylori. The objective of the present study was to establish whether this association is causal. Forty patients with proven infection with H. pylori and endoscopic evidence of past or present duodenal ulcer disease were randomized to receive either polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA group), in the form of capsules and margarine, or a placebo (control). Both groups received concurrent H2 antagonist therapy. Efficacy of therapy was determined endoscopically by assessment of ulcer healing while H. pylori status was determined by antral biopsy, urease (EC 3.5.1.5) culture and histological assessment of the severity of H. pylori infection. Antral levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) were quantified. Compliance was monitored. Before treatment, both groups were comparable for severity of H. pylori infection, smoking status and levels of LTB4 and PGE2. Despite a significant difference in consumption of linoleic  (19.9 (SE 1.6) g for PUFA group v. 6.7 (SE 0.8) g for controls (P < 0.01) and  (2.6 (SE 0.2) g v. 0.6 (SE 0.03) g (P < 0.01) there was no significant change in either the severity of H. pylori infection or prostaglandin levels in either group at 6 weeks. Consumption of a considerable amount of PUFA does not inhibit the  of the stomach by H. pylori nor does this alter the inflammatory changes characteristic of H. pylori gastritis. We conclude that the association between duodenal ulceration and a low level of dietary PUFA is likely to be spurious, probably reflecting the effect of confounding factors such as affluence, social class or smoking.</p><p>Keyword:['colonization']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28108729>Comparative omega-3 fatty  enrichment of egg yolks from first-cycle laying hens fed flaxseed oil or ground flaxseed.</a></h2><p>When laying hen diets are enriched with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to generate value-added eggs for human consumption markets, concentrations of  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) in the yolk can reach 250 mg/50 g whole egg. Flaxseed, a rich source of ALA, is commonly used for omega-3 enrichment; however, the impact of dietary flaxseed source (extracted oil vs. milled seed) on fatty  transfer to egg yolk in laying hens is unknown. Therefore, transfer of ALA, EPA, and DHA into egg yolk from extracted flaxseed oil or milled flaxseed was evaluated in Hy-Line W-36 laying hens over an 8-week feeding period (25 to 33 wk old). Hens (n = 132) were randomly housed with 3 birds/cage (4 replicates/treatment) for each of the 11 treatment groups. Diets were isocaloric and consisted of a control diet, 5 flaxseed oil diets (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, or 5.0% flaxseed oil), and 5 milled flaxseed diets (calculated flaxseed oil concentration from milled flaxseed 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0%). Increasing dietary concentrations of flaxseed oil and milled flaxseed resulted in increased ALA, EPA, and DHA concentration in egg yolk, and fatty  deposition from flaxseed oil was 2 times greater compared to milled flaxseed when fed at the same dietary inclusions (P < 0.01). Egg yolk EPA and DHA concentrations were not different due to oil or milled source (P = 0.21); however, increasing dietary inclusion rates of flaxseed oil from either source increased yolk EPA and DHA (P < 0.01). Hens fed either flaxseed oil or milled flaxseed resulted in reduced BW change as dietary concentrations increased (P = 0.02). Feed efficiency increased as flaxseed oil increased in concentration, while feeding milled flaxseed decreased feed efficiency (P = 0.01). Analysis of the nitrogen corrected apparent metabolizable  of flaxseed oil resulted in 7,488 kcal/kg on an as-fed basis. Dietary flaxseed oil improved feed efficiency and increased ALA deposition into yolk compared to a milled source, demonstrating flaxseed oil to be a viable alternative for ALA egg enrichment.© 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29432580>Integrated regulation triggered by a cryophyte ω-3 desaturase gene confers multiple-stress tolerance in tobacco.</a></h2><p>ω-3 fatty  desaturases (FADs) are thought to contribute to plant stress tolerance mainly through  (C18:3)-induced membrane stabilization, but a comprehensive analysis of their roles in stress adaptation is lacking. Here, we isolated a microsomal ω-3 FAD gene (CbFAD3) from a cryophyte (Chorispora bungeana) and elucidated its functions in stress tolerance. CbFAD3, exhibiting a high identity to Arabidopsis AtFAD3, was up-regulated by abiotic stresses. Its functionality was verified by heterogonous expression in yeast. Overexpression of CbFAD3 in tobacco constitutively increased C18:3 in both leaves and roots, which maintained the membrane fluidity, and enhanced plant tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stresses. Notably, the constitutively increased C18:3 induced a sustained activation of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase, thereby, changing the stress-induced Ca2+ signaling. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging system, which was positively correlated with the level of C18:3, was also activated in the transgenic lines. Microarray analysis showed that CbFAD3-overexpressing plants increased the expression of stress-responsive genes, most of which are affected by C18:3, Ca2+, or ROS. Together, CbFAD3 confers tolerance to multiple stresses in tobacco through the C18:3-induced integrated regulation of membrane, Ca2+, ROS, and stress-responsive genes. This is in contrast with previous observations that simply attribute stress tolerance to membrane stabilization.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26615716>Impact of methods used to express levels of circulating fatty acids on the degree and direction of associations with blood lipids in humans.</a></h2><p>Numerous studies have examined relationships between disease biomarkers (such as blood lipids) and levels of circulating or cellular fatty acids. In such association studies, fatty acids have typically been expressed as the percentage of a particular fatty  relative to the total fatty acids in a sample. Using two human cohorts, this study examined relationships between blood lipids (TAG, and LDL, HDL or total cholesterol) and circulating fatty acids expressed either as a percentage of total or as concentration in serum. The direction of the correlation between stearic , linoleic , dihomo-γ-, arachidonic  and DHA and circulating TAG reversed when fatty acids were expressed as concentrations v. a percentage of total. Similar reversals were observed for these fatty acids when examining their associations with the ratio of total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol. This reversal pattern was replicated in serum samples from both human cohorts. The correlations between blood lipids and fatty acids expressed as a percentage of total could be mathematically modelled from the concentration data. These data reveal that the different methods of expressing fatty acids lead to dissimilar correlations between blood lipids and certain fatty acids. This study raises important questions about how such reversals in association patterns impact the interpretation of numerous association studies evaluating fatty acids and their relationships with disease biomarkers or risk.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24267040>An acute intake of a walnut-enriched meal improves postprandial adiponectin response in healthy young adults.</a></h2><p>A deficit in adiponectin plays an important causal role in insulin resistance and . We hypothesized that as seen during the fasting state, the intake of a walnut-enriched meal increased postprandial adiponectin. Twenty-one healthy white men followed a 4-week baseline diet and then consumed 3 fat-loaded meals that included 1 g fat/kg body weight (65% fat) according to a randomized crossover design: olive oil-enriched meal (22% saturated fatty acids [SFA], 38% monounsaturated fatty acids [MUFA], 4% polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA]), butter-enriched meal (35% SFA, 22% MUFA, 4% PUFA), and walnut-enriched meal (20% SFA, 24% MUFA, 16% PUFA, and 4% α-). Leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and free fatty acids were determined at 0, 3, 6, and 8.5 hours after the fat load. After the walnut-enriched meal, plasma adiponectin concentrations were higher at 3 and 6 hours (P = .011, P = .046, respectively) compared with the butter-enriched meal and higher at 6 hours compared with the olive oil-enriched meal (P = .036). Free fatty  levels decreased from baseline at 3 hours after the walnut-enriched meal (P = .001). No differences were observed between the 3 meals for leptin and resistin responses. Our data confirmed a beneficial profile in the postprandial response to walnuts, source of omega-3 PUFA with an increased postprandial adiponectin and lower postprandial free fatty  responses. These findings suggest that the postprandial state is important for understanding the possible cardioprotective effects associated with omega-3 PUFA dietary fat.© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To address this limitation A. protothecoides was selected for adaptation to conditions of 100× and 5× lower phosphate and peptone, respectively, compared to 'wild-type media'. The A. protothecoides showed initial signs of adaptation by 45-50 days, and steady state growth at ~100 days. The low phosphate (P)-adapted strain produced up to ~30% greater biomass, while total lipids (~10% w/w) remained about the same, compared to the wild-type strain. Metabolomic analyses indicated that the low P-adapted produced 3.3-fold more saturated palmitic  (16:0) and 2.2-fold less  (18:3), compared to the wild-type strain, resulting in an ~11% increase in caloric value, from 19.5kJ/g for the wild-type strain to 21.6kJ/g for the low P-adapted strain, due to the amounts and composition of certain saturated fatty acids, compared to the wild type strain. Biochemical changes in A. protothecoides adapted to lower phosphate conditions were assessed by comparative RNA-Seq analysis, which yielded 27,279 transcripts. Among them, 2,667 and 15 genes were significantly down- and up-regulated, at >999-fold and >3-fold (adjusted p-value <0.1), respectively. The expression of genes encoding proteins involved in cellular processes such as division, growth, and membrane biosynthesis, showed a trend toward down-regulation. At the genomic level, synonymous SNPs and Indels were observed primarily in coding regions, with the 40S ribosomal subunit gene harboring substantial SNPs. Overall, the adapted strain out-performed the wild-type strain by prioritizing the use of its limited phosphate supply for essential biological processes. The low P-adapted A. protothecoides is expected to be more economical to grow over the wild-type strain, based on overall greater productivity and caloric content, while importantly, also requiring 100-fold less phosphate.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26597785>Palmitic  (16:0) competes with omega-6 linoleic and omega-3 ɑ- acids for FADS2 mediated Δ6-desaturation.</a></h2><p>Sapienic , 16:1n-10 is the most abundant unsaturated fatty  on human skin where its synthesis is mediated by FADS2 in the sebaceous glands. The FADS2 product introduces a double bond at the Δ6, Δ4 and Δ8 positions by acting on at least ten substrates, including 16:0, 18:2n-6, and 18:3n-3. Our aim was to characterize the competition for accessing FADS2 mediated Δ6 desaturation between 16:0 and the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the human diet, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, to evaluate whether competition may be relevant in other tissues and thus linked to  abnormalities associated with FADS2 or fatty  levels. MCF7 cells stably transformed with FADS2 biosynthesize 16:1n-10 from exogenous 16:0 in preference to 16:1n-7, the immediate product of SCD highly expressed in cancer cell lines, and 16:1n-9 via partial β-oxidation of 18:1n-9. Increasing availability of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 resulted in decreased bioconversion of 16:0 to 16:1n-10, simultaneously increasing the levels of highly unsaturated products. FADS2 cells accumulate the desaturation-elongation products 20:3n-6 and 20:4n-3 in preference to the immediate desaturation products 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3 implying prompt/coupled elongation of the nascent desaturation products. MCF7 cells incorporate newly synthesized 16:1n-10 into phospholipids. These data suggest that excess 16:0 due to, for instance, de novo lipogenesis from high carbohydrate or alcohol consumption, inhibits synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids, and may in part explain why supplemental preformed EPA and DHA in some studies improves insulin resistance and other factors related to diabetes and  aggravated by excess calorie consumption.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to dietary intakes, which are low for many individuals, tissue EPA and DHA are also influenced by the rate of bioconversion from α- (αLNA).

Such benefits were related to the level of dietary essential fatty acids (EFA, linoleic , C18:2n-6; and α-, C18:3n-3) during lactation.

This phenomenon seems to be increasingly important with advancing sow age because of a progressive reduction of body EFA pool over successive lactations. The net effect of supplemental EFA during lactation was to create a positive EFA balance, which improved the subsequent reproduction of sows. Adequate linoleic  intake improved the proportion of sows that farrowed in the subsequent cycle (Farrowing rate (%) = [(-1.5 × 10(-3) × linoleic  intake (g/d)(2)) + (0.53 × linoleic  intake (g/d)) + (45.2)]; quadratic P = 0.002, R(2) = 0.997, RMSE = 0.031). In addition, increasing linoleic  intake increased the number of pigs born in the subsequent cycle (total pigs born (n) = [(9.4 × 10(-5) × linoleic  intake (g/d)(2)) + (0.04 × linoleic  intake (g/d)) + (10.94)]; quadratic P = 0.002, R(2) = 0.997, RMSE = 0.031). Supplemental α- resulted in a rapid return to estrus (sows bred: sows weaned = 94.2 %; wean-to-estrus interval = 4.0 d) and achieved a high retention of pregnancy (sows pregnant: sows bred = 98 %). Collectively, we conclude that a minimum dietary intake of 10 g/d of α-, simultaneous with a minimum of 125 g/d of linoleic  should be provided to ≥ 95 % of the sows; thereby, achieving a maximum sow reproductive efficiency through multiple mechanisms that include rapid return to estrus, high maintenance of pregnancy and large subsequent litter size in mature sows, that appear to be susceptible to EFA deficiency.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16571150>Gender-related response of lipid metabolism to dietary fatty acids in the hamster.</a></h2><p>Gender and dietary fatty acids are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, disturbances of which can lead to pathologies such as  or CVD. Possible interactions between these factors were investigated in male and female hamsters fed diets rich in either saturated fatty acids ( "butter" diet) or in  ( "linseed oil" diet). Gender effect predominated over the diet effect on cholesterol (CH) metabolism; compared to males, females exhibited lower concentrations of plasma total CH (-20 %, P<0.001), LDL-CH (-40 %, P<0.001) and HDL-CH (-16 %, P<0.001), together with higher LDL receptor (+40 %) and lower HDL receptor (-60 %) hepatic content. Triacylglycerol (TG) metabolism was affected by diet above all: compared to animals fed the "butter" diet, those fed the "linseed oil" diet exhibited lower plasma (-23 %, P=0.046) and liver TG (-20 %, P=0.026) concentration which may result from both an increased beta-oxidation (P<0.001), without any change in PPARalpha mRNA, and a decreased hepatic lipogenesis (P=0.023), without increased sterol response element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) mRNA. The response to diet was much more pronounced in males than in females, without gender effect on the transcription level of PPARalpha and SREBP1c. Finally, the "linseed oil" diet decreased the insulin resistance index (-80 %, P<0.001) with a more marked effect in males, in relation to their higher hepatic PPARgamma expression (+90 %, P=0.012). In conclusion, in our model, the response of either TG or CH to dietary fatty acids is modulated differently by gender.

Δ5-Olefinic acids from pine nut oil were effectively concentrated by repeated lipase-catalyzed esterification. The pine nut oil contained three major Δ5-olefinic acids, namely taxoleic acid (C18:2 Δ5,9),  (C18:3 Δ5,9,12), and sciadonic acid (C20:3 Δ5,11,14). The fatty acids present in pine nut oil were selectively esterified with ethanol using Lipozyme RM IM from Rhizomucor miehei as a biocatalyst. The Δ5-olefinic acids were concentrated in the unesterified fatty acid fraction. The optimum molar ratio of the substrates (fatty acid:ethanol), temperature, the enzyme loading, and the reaction time were 1:7, 25°C, 5% of total substrate , and 6 h, respectively. There was no significant effect in the concentration of Δ5-olefinic acids when water was added in the reaction mixture. The same protocol and optimum conditions were employed for two times repeated lipase-catalyzed esterifications. In first lipase-catalyzed esterification, the Δ5-olefinic acids content in the pine nut oil increased from 17 mol% to 51 mol% with a yield of 40 mol%.

Depending on the regio-specificity of a LOX, the incorporation of molecular  leads to formation of 9- or 13-fatty  hydroperoxides, which are used by LOX itself as well as by members of at least six different enzyme families to form a series of biologically active molecules, collectively called oxylipins. The best characterised oxylipins are the jasmonates: jasmonic  (JA) and its isoleucine conjugate that are signalling compounds in vegetative and propagative plant development. In several types of nitrogen-fixing root nodules, LOX expression and/or activity is induced during nodule development. Allene oxide cyclase (AOC), a committed enzyme of the JA biosynthetic pathway, has been shown to localise to plastids of nodules of one legume and two actinorhizal plants, Medicago truncatula, Datisca glomerata and Casuarina glauca, respectively. Using an antibody that recognises several types of LOX interspecifically, LOX protein levels were compared in roots and nodules of these plants, showing no significant differences and no obvious nodule-specific isoforms. A comparison of the cell-specific localisation of LOXs and AOC led to the conclusion that (i) only cytosolic LOXs were detected although it is generally assumed that the (13S)-hydroperoxy α- for JA biosynthesis is produced in the plastids, and (ii) in cells of the nodule vascular tissue that contain AOC, no LOX protein could be detected.© 2011 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12970495>Nitrogen deficiency increases volicitin-induced volatile emission, jasmonic  accumulation, and ethylene sensitivity in maize.</a></h2><p>Insect herbivore-induced plant volatile emission and the subsequent attraction of natural enemies is facilitated by fatty -amino  conjugate (FAC) elicitors, such as volicitin [N-(17-hydroxylinolenoyl)-L-glutamine], present in caterpillar oral secretions.

In maize (Zea mays) seedlings, we examined the interaction of volicitin, JA, and E on the induction of volatile emission at different levels of nitrogen (N) availability that are known to influence E sensitivity. N availability and volicitin-induced sesquiterpene emission are inversely related as maximal responses were elicited in N-deficient plants. Plants with low N availability demonstrated similar volatile responses to volicitin (1 nmol plant(-1)) and JA (100 nmol plant(-1)). In contrast, plants with medium N availability released much lower amounts of volicitin-induced sesquiterpenes compared with JA, suggesting an alteration in volicitin-induced JA levels. As predicted, low N plants exhibited greater sustained increases in wound- and volicitin-induced JA levels compared with medium N plants. N availability also altered volicitin-E interactions. In low N plants, E synergized volicitin-induced sesquiterpene and indole emission 4- to 12-fold, with significant interactions first detected at 10 nL L(-1) E. Medium N plants demonstrated greatly reduced volicitin-E interactions. Volicitin-induced sesquiterpene emission was increased by E and was decreased by pretreatment the E perception inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene without alteration in volicitin-induced JA levels.

Most of the published research has been on the function of class 1 hemoglobins. To investigate the role of class 2 hemoglobins, transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants were generated overexpressing Arabidopsis hemoglobin-2 (AHb2) under the control of a seed-specific promoter. Overexpression of AHb2 led to a 40% increase in the total fatty  content of developing and mature seeds in three subsequent generations. This was mainly due to an increase in the polyunsaturated C18:2 (ω-6) linoleic and C18:3 (ω-3) α- acids. Moreover, AHb2 overexpression led to an increase in the C18:2/C18:1 and C18:3/C18:2 ratios as well as in the C18:3 content in mol % of total fatty acids and in the unsaturation/saturation index of total seed lipids. The increase in fatty  content was mainly due to a stimulation of the rate of triacylglycerol synthesis, which was attributable to a 3-fold higher energy state and a 2-fold higher sucrose content of the seeds. Under low external , AHb2 overexpression maintained an up to 5-fold higher energy state and prevented fermentation. This is consistent with AHb2 overexpression results in improved  availability within developing seeds. In contrast to this, overexpression of class 1 hemoglobin did not lead to any significant increase in the metabolic performance of the seeds. These results provide evidence for a specific function of class 2 hemoglobin in seed oil production and in promoting the accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by facilitating  supply in developing seeds.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26040376>[Consumption of nuts and vegetal oil in people with type 1 ].</a></h2><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the cardiovascular benefits of the Mediterranean Diet, enriched with olive oil and nuts.

Additional studies have shown resolvins, metabolites of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, can induce neurite outgrowth in neuron cultures and that treating type 1 or type 2 diabetic mice with resolvin D1 or E1 provides benefit for peripheral neuropathy similar to fish oil. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from fish oil and their derivatives have anti-inflammatory properties and could provide benefit for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. However, clinical trials are needed to determine whether this statement is true.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934976>Enhancing Omega-3 Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty  Content of Dairy-Derived Foods for Human Consumption.</a></h2><p>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA) are termed essential fatty acids because they cannot be synthesized  by humans due to the lack of delta-12 and delta-15 desaturase enzymes and must therefore be acquired from the diet.  PUFA include α- (ALA, 18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5n-3), docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6n-3), and the less recognized docosapentaenoic  (DPA, 22:5n-3). The three long-chain (≥C)  PUFA (n-3 LC-PUFA), EPA, DHA, and DPA play an important role in human health by reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Up to the present time, seafood, and in particular, fish oil-derived products, have been the richest sources of n-3 LC-PUFA. The human diet generally contains insufficient amounts of these essential FA due largely to the low consumption of seafood. This issue provides opportunities to enrich the content of  PUFA in other common food groups. Milk and milk products have traditionally been a major component of human diets, but are also among some of the poorest sources of  PUFA. Consideration of the high consumption of milk and its processed products worldwide and the human health benefits has led to a large number of studies targeting the enhancement of  PUFA content in dairy products. The main objective of this review was to evaluate the major strategies that have been employed to enhance  PUFA content in dairy products and to unravel potential knowledge gaps for further research on this topic. Nutritional manipulation to date has been the main approach for altering milk fatty acids (FA) in ruminants. However, the main challenge is ruminal biohydrogenation in which dietary PUFA are hydrogenated into monounsaturated FA and/or ultimately, saturated FA, due to rumen microbial activities. The inclusion of oil seed and vegetable oil in dairy animal diets significantly elevates ALA content, while the addition of rumen-protected marine-derived supplements is the most effective way to increase the concentration of EPA, DHA, and DPA in dairy products. In our view, the mechanisms of  LC-PUFA biosynthesis pathway from ALA and the biohydrogenation of individual  LC-PUFA in ruminants need to be better elucidated. Identified knowledge gaps regarding the activities of candidate genes regulating the concentrations of 3 PUFA and the responses of ruminants to specific  supplementation regimes are also critical to a greater understanding of nutrition-genetics interactions driving .</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653011>Fatty  Profile and Antioxidant Status Fingerprint in Sarcopenic Elderly Patients: Role of Diet and Exercise.</a></h2><p>Plasma fatty acids (FAs) and oxidant status contribute to the etiology of sarcopenia in the elderly concurring to age-related muscle loss and elderly frailty through several mechanisms including changes in FA composition within the sarcolemma, promotion of chronic low-grade inflammation, and . The aim of this study was to determine the FA profile and pro-antioxidant status in sarcopenic frail elderly patients enrolled in a nutritional and physical activity program and to evaluate their correlation with clinical markers. Moreover, the possible changes, produced after a short-term clinical protocol, were evaluated. Plasma and erythrocyte FA composition and pro-antioxidant status were analyzed in sarcopenic elderly subjects recruited for the randomized clinical study and treated with a placebo or dietary supplement, a personalized diet, and standardized physical activity. Subjects were tested before and after 30 days of treatment. Pearson correlations between biochemical parameters and patients' characteristics at recruitment indicate interesting features of sarcopenic status such as negative correlation among the plasma FA profile, age, and physical characteristics. Physical activity and dietetic program alone for 30 days induced a decrease of saturated FA concentration with a significant increase of dihomo-gamma-. Supplementation plus physical activity induced a significant decrease of linoleic , omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs, and an increase of stearic and oleic  concentration. Moreover, glutathione reductase activity, which is an indicator of antioxidant status, significantly increased in erythrocytes. Changes over time between groups indicate significant differences for saturated FAs, which suggest that the amino  supplementation restores FA levels that are consumed during physical activity. A relationship between FA and clinical/metabolic status revealed unique correlations and a specific metabolic and lipidomic fingerprint in sarcopenic elderly. The results indicate the positive beneficial role of supplementation and physical activity on plasma FA status and the antioxidant system as a co-adjuvant approach in sarcopenic, frail, elderly patients.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28633686>Polymorphisms of the TNF-α gene interact with plasma fatty acids on inflammatory biomarker profile: a population-based, cross-sectional study in São Paulo, Brazil.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship of four TNF-α SNP with inflammatory biomarkers and plasma fatty acids (FA), and the interaction among them in a population-based, cross-sectional study in São Paulo, Brazil.

In all, eleven plasma inflammatory biomarkers and plasma FA profile were determined. To analyse the interaction between TNF-α SNP and plasma FA, a cluster analysis was performed to stratify individuals based on eleven inflammatory biomarkers into two groups used as outcome: inflammatory (INF) and non-inflammatory clusters. The -238A allele carriers had higher TNF-α (P=0·033), IL-6 (P=0·013), IL-1β (P=0·037), IL-12 (0·048) and IL-10 (P=0·010) than the GG genotype. The -308A allele carriers also had lower levels of plasma palmitoleic  (P=0·009), oleic  (P=0·039), total MUFA (P=0·014), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) activity index-16 (P=0·007), SCD-18 (P=0·020) and higher levels of PUFA (P=0·046) and DHA (P=0·044).

However, whether the chemical structures of FFA could influence their interactions with NPs remain unknown. This study investigated the interactions between ZnO NPs and saturated or unsaturated FFA (complexed to BSA), namely stearic  (SA, C18:0), oleic  (OA, C18:1), and α- (ALA, C18:3). It was shown that BSA, SA, OA, and ALA increased the atomic force microscope (AFM) heights as well the polydispersity index (PDI) of ZnO NPs. BSA modestly protected THP-1 macrophages from ZnO NP exposure, whereas OA and ALA led to relatively less cyto-protective effects of BSA. Moreover, only co-exposure to ZnO NPs and SA significantly promoted the release of interleukin-8. BSA, SA, OA, and ALA equally changed intracellular ROS and Zn ions associated with ZnO exposure, but co-exposure to ZnO NPs and OA/ALA particularly activated the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-apoptosis genes. In combination, these results showed that FFA could influence the colloidal aspects and toxicological signaling pathway of ZnO NPs, which is dependent on the number of unsaturated bonds of FFA.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26305484>Association of plasma fatty  composition with plasma irisin levels in normal weight and overweight/obese children.</a></h2><p>Irisin has been suggested to protect against overweight.

NLRX1 is a mitochondrial-associated NOD-like receptor involved in the modulation of immune and metabolic responses. This study utilizes molecular docking approaches to investigate the structure of NLRX1 and experimentally assesses binding to naturally occurring compounds from several natural product and lipid databases. Screening of compound libraries predicts targeting of NLRX1 by conjugated trienes, polyketides, prenol lipids, sterol lipids, and coenzyme A-containing fatty acids for activating the NLRX1 pathway. The ligands of NLRX1 were identified by docking punicic  (PUA), eleostearic  (ESA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) to the C-terminal fragment of the human NLRX1 (cNLRX1). Their binding and that of positive control RNA to cNLRX1 were experimentally determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. In addition, the ligand binding sites of cNLRX1 were predicted in silico and validated experimentally. Target mutagenesis studies demonstrate that mutation of 4 critical residues ASP677, PHE680, PHE681, and GLU684 to alanine resulted in diminished affinity of PUA, ESA, and DHA to NLRX1. Consistent with the regulatory actions of NLRX1 on the NF-κB pathway, treatment of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM)s with PUA and DHA suppressed NF-κB activity in a NLRX1 dependent mechanism. In addition, a series of pre-clinical efficacy studies were performed using a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Our findings showed that the regulatory function of PUA on colitis is NLRX1 dependent.

In vertebrates, phospholipase A (PLA) releases arachidonic  (AA) from phospholipids (PLs) for biosynthesis of various eicosanoids. However, little AA is found in PLs of lepidopteran insects. Spodoptera exigua, a lepidopteran insect, is known to use eicosanoids to mediate . Although AA was not detected in PLs of hemocytes and fat body (two immune tissues) of naïve larvae, it was detected at small but significant level after bacterial infection, suggesting induction of AA biosynthesis for . Based on a mammalian AA biosynthetic pathway, this study hypothesizes that AA is synthesized from C18 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) precursor by subsequent desaturation and elongation reactions because PLs of S. exigua larvae are rich in linoleic . After inhibiting PLA activity to prevent release of free fatty acids, different PUFA precursors were injected to S. exigua larvae followed by assessment of eicosanoid-mediated cellular immune response. ω-6 PUFAs were effective in inducing immune response whereas α- (an ω-3 PUFA) was not. Several fatty acyl desaturases (SeDESs) have been predicted from S. exigua transcriptomes. Specific inhibitors against Δ5 or Δ6 DESs inhibited eicosanoid-mediated immune responses. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) specific to Δ5 or Δ6 DES genes significantly suppressed eicosanoid-mediated immune responses. Four very long chain fatty  elongase genes (SeEloV-A ∼ SeEloV-D) were predicted. Among respective RNAi treatments of these genes, only one RNAi treatment specific to type 5 elongase (SeEloV-B) suppressed eicosanoid-mediated immune response. These results suggest that S. exigua larvae can synthesize AA from linoleic  via Δ5- and Δ6-desaturations by SeDESs along with chain elongation by SeEloV-B. Finally, this study showed significant fitness cost of uncontrolled AA biosynthesis. AA injection alone without bacterial challenge significantly induced both cellular and humoral immune responses. This unnecessary energy expense due to free AA resulted in reduced pupal size and decreased adult egg production. The detrimental effect of free AA explains physiological significance of little AA content in lepidopteran insects except for life-or-death situation such as pathogen infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present paper, five potato cultivars with contrasting resistance to P. infestans were submitted to infection. Lipoxygenase pathway response was studied at both transcriptional and metabolic levels. A Northern blot preliminary study revealed that lipoxygenase (lox1 and lox3) and divinyl ether synthase genes were clearly up-regulated 96h after leaf inoculation with P. infestans. Profiling of free and esterified oxylipins performed 24h, 48h, 72h and 96h after inoculation, showed that esterified oxylipins are mainly produced with 9-derivatives in higher concentrations (esterified forms of colnelenic , 9-hydroxy octadecatrienoic , 9-hydroperoxy octadecatrienoic ). Oxylipin accumulation is undetectable 24h after infection, slightly detectable after 48h, reaching highest concentrations after 96h.

However, when grown at 20°C, sy-2 exhibits developmental defects, such as chlorophyll deficiency and shrunken leaves. To understand the underlying mechanism of this temperature-dependent response, phenotypic characterization and genetic analysis were performed. The results revealed abnormal chloroplast structures and cell collapse in leaves of the sy-2 plants grown at 20°C. Moreover, an excessive accumulation of reactive  species (ROS) resulting in cell death was detected in the chlorophyll-deficient sectors of the leaves. However, the expression profile of the ROS scavenging genes did not alter in sy-2 plants grown at 20°C. A further analysis of fatty  content in the leaves showed the impaired pathway of linoleic  (18:2) to  (18:3). Additionally, the Cafad7 gene was downregulated in sy-2 plants. This change may lead to dramatic physiological disorder and alteration of leaf morphology in sy-2 plants by losing low-temperature tolerance. Genetic analysis of an F(2) population from a cross between C. chinense 'sy-2' and wild-type C. chinense 'No. 3341' showed that the sy-2 phenotype is controlled by a single recessive gene. Molecular mapping revealed that the sy-2 gene is located at a genomic region of the pepper linkage group 1, corresponding to the 300 kb region of the Ch1_scaffold 00106 in tomato chromosome 1. Candidate genes in this region will reveal the identity of sy-2 and the underlying mechanism of the temperature-dependent plant response.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18190803>Multivariate near infrared spectroscopy models for predicting the methyl esters content in biodiesel.</a></h2><p>Biodiesel is the main alternative to fossil diesel. The key advantages of its use are the fact that it is a non-toxic renewable resource, which leads to lower emissions of polluting gases. European governments are targeting the incorporation of 20% of biofuels in the general fuels until 2020. Chemically, biodiesel is a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters, derived from vegetable oils or animal fats, which is usually produced by a transesterification reaction, where the oils/fats react with an alcohol, in the presence of a catalyst. The European Standard (EN 14214) establishes 25 parameters that have to be analysed to certify biodiesel quality and the analytical methods that should be used to determine those properties. This work reports the use of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to determine the esters content in biodiesel as well as the content in linolenic acid methyl esters (C18:3) in industrial and laboratory-scale biodiesel samples. Furthermore, calibration models for myristic (C14:0), palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2) acid methyl esters were also obtained. Principal component analysis was used for the qualitative analysis of the spectra, while partial least squares regression was used to develop the calibration models between analytical and spectral data. The results confirm that NIR spectroscopy, in combination with multivariate calibration, is a promising technique to assess the biodiesel quality control in both laboratory-scale and industrial scale samples.</p><p>Keyword:[' methyl esterenergy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30683848>The effect of different sources of fish and camelina sativa oil on immune cell and adipose tissue mRNA expression in subjects with abnormal fasting glucose metabolism: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Molecular mechanisms linking fish and vegetable oil intakes to their healthy metabolic effects may involve attenuation of inflammation. Our primary aim was to examine in a randomized controlled setting whether diets enriched in fatty fish (FF), lean fish (LF) or ALA-rich camelina sativa oil (CSO) differ in their effects on the mRNA expression response of selected inflammation-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in subjects with impaired fasting glucose.Samples from 72 participants randomized to one of the following 12-week intervention groups, FF (n = 19), LF (n = 19), CSO (n = 17) or a control group (n = 17), were available for the PBMC study. For SAT, 39 samples (n = 8, n = 10, n = 9, n = 12, respectively) were available. The mRNA expression was measured at baseline and 12 weeks by TaqMan® Low Density Array.In PBMCs, LF decreased ICAM1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05), which was different (P = 0.06, Bonferroni correction) from the observed increase in the FF group (P < 0.05). Also, compared to the control group, LF decreased ICAM1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05). Moreover, the change in ICAM1 mRNA expression correlated positively with the intake of FF (P < 0.05) and negatively with the intake of LF (P < 0.05), independently of study group. A diet enriched in CSO, a rich source of  (ALA), decreased PBMC IFNG mRNA expression (P < 0.01). The intake of CSO in the CSO group, but not the increase in plasma ALA proportions, correlated inversely with the IFNG mRNA expression in PBMCs (P = 0.08). In SAT, when compared with the control group, the effect of FF on decreasing IL1RN mRNA expression was significant (P < 0.03).We propose that CSO intake may partly exert its benefits through immuno-inflammatory molecular regulation in PBMCs, while modulation of ICAM1 expression, an endothelial/vascular-related gene, may be more dependent on the type of fish consumed.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'inflammation', 'insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29413364>Arachidonic  supplementation modulates blood and skeletal muscle lipid profile with no effect on basal  in resistance exercise trained men.</a></h2><p>Arachidonic  (ARA), an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), is the metabolic precursor to the eicosanoid family of lipid mediators. Eicosanoids have potent pro-inflammatory actions, but also act as important autocrine/paracrine signaling molecules in skeletal muscle growth and development. Whether dietary ARA is incorporated into skeletal muscle phospholipids and the resulting impact on intramuscular inflammatory and adaptive processes in-vivo is not known. In the current study, resistance trained men (≥1 year) received dietary supplementation with 1.5g/day ARA (n=9, 24 ± 1.5 years) or placebo (n=10, 26 ± 1.3 years) for 4-weeks while continuing their normal training regimen. Plasma and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were collected in an overnight fasted state at baseline and week 4. ARA supplementation increased plasma content of ARA and gamma-, while decreasing relative abundance of linoleic , eicosapentaenoic , and dihomo-gamma-. In skeletal muscle, ARA and dihomo-gamma- content increased, whereas  was reduced. Compared to placebo, ARA supplementation reduced circulating platelet and monocyte number, and decreased the mRNA expression of the immune cell surface markers; neutrophil elastase/CD66b and interleukin 1-beta, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In muscle, ARA supplementation increased mRNA expression of the myogenic regulatory factors; MyoD and myogenin, but had no effect on a range of immune cell markers or inflammatory cytokines.

Initial oxygenation of substrate fatty acids is mainly catalyzed by lipoxygenases (LOXs) and α-dioxygenases but can also take place non-enzymatically by autoxidation or singlet -dependent reactions. The resulting hydroperoxides are further metabolized by secondary enzymes to produce a large variety of compounds, including the hormone jasmonic  (JA) and short-chain green leaf volatiles. In flowering plants, which lack arachidonic , oxylipins are produced mainly from oxidation of polyunsaturated C18 fatty acids, notably  and linoleic acids. Algae and mosses in addition possess polyunsaturated C20 fatty acids including arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids, which can also be oxidized by LOXs and transformed into bioactive compounds. Mosses are phylogenetically placed between unicellular green algae and flowering plants, allowing evolutionary studies of the different oxylipin pathways. During the last years the moss Physcomitrella patens has become an attractive model plant for understanding oxylipin biosynthesis and diversity. In addition to the advantageous evolutionary position, functional studies of the different oxylipin-forming enzymes can be performed in this moss by targeted gene disruption or single point mutations by means of homologous recombination. Biochemical characterization of several oxylipin-producing enzymes and oxylipin profiling in P. patens reveal the presence of a wider range of oxylipins compared to flowering plants, including C18 as well as C20-derived oxylipins. Surprisingly, one of the most active oxylipins in plants, JA, is not synthesized in this moss. In this review, we present an overview of oxylipins produced in mosses and discuss the current knowledge related to the involvement of oxylipin-producing enzymes and their products in moss development and defense.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30241083>Metabolic responses of Ulva compressa to single and combined heavy metals.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of metals and metabolic responses were studied for two Cd and Cu concentrations (1 and 10 μM) either alone or as a combination in marine macroalga after 7 days of exposure.

However, non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in flaxseed decreases nutrient digestibility and limits the availability of n-3 FA.

Five day-old broiler chicks were fed a corn-soybean basal diet with 0% flaxseed, a basal diet with 10% of flaxseed, or 10% flaxseed + 0.05% enzyme diet up to day 42 of growth. Total lipids, including long-chain (≥20C) n-3 FA and monounsaturated FA, were increased in flax-fed broiler livers. Enzyme addition reduced arachidonic  and total long chain n-6 FA.

Four phospholipids were compared; each had a phosphocholine head group, stearic  in the sn-1 position, and either oleic, , arachidonic, or docosahexaenoic  (DHA) in the sn-2 position.

The addition of beta2-microglobulin, which associates non-covalently with the alpha-chain and prevents alpha-chain aggregation, did not equalize antibody binding to proteoliposomes of different lipid composition, suggesting that free alpha-chain aggregation was not responsible for disparate antibody binding.

This study was aimed at investigating the antioxidative potentials of probiotic lactobacilli of Indian gut origin and their ability to augment antioxidant defense enzyme systems in the host cells under oxidative stress conditions. A total of 39 Lactobacillus cultures were assessed for their resistance against reactive  species. Most of the cultures were moderately to strongly resistant towards 0.4 mM H(2)O(2). The Lactobacillus isolate CH4 was the most H(2)O(2) resistant culture with only 0.06 log cycle reduction. Majority of the cultures demonstrated high resistance towards hydroxyl ions and Lp21 was the most resistant with log count reduction of 0.20 fold only. Almost all the cultures were also quite resistant to superoxide anions. Lp21 also showed the highest superoxide dismutase content (0.8971 U). Amongst the 39 cultures, Lactobacillus spp. S3 showed the highest total antioxidative activity of 77.85 ± 0.13 % followed by Lp55 (56.1 ± 1.2 %) in terms of per cent inhibition of  oxidation. Lp9 up-regulated the expression of superoxide dismutase 2 gene in HT-29 cells both at 0.1 mM (1.997 folds) and 1.0 mM H(2)O(2) (2.058 folds) concentrations. In case of glutathione peroxidase-1, Lp9, Lp91 and Lp55 showed significant (P < 0.001) up-regulation in the gene expression to the level of 5.451, 8.706 and 10.083 folds, respectively when HT-29 was challenged with 0.1 mM H(2)O(2).

The ability of the latter to form covalent adducts with macromolecules and modify cellular functions has been linked to numerous pathological processes. Concomitantly, evidence has accumulated on specific signaling properties of low concentrations of 4-HNE that may induce hormetic and protective responses to peroxidation stress in cells.

Genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) reported associations between polymorphisms in FADS1-FADS2 and variations in plasma concentrations of PUFAs, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. However, it is not established whether dietary PUFAs intake modulates these associations. We assessed whether dietary linoleic  (LA) or α- (ALA) modulate the association between the FADS1 rs174547 polymorphism (a GWAS hit) and lipid and anthropometric phenotypes.Dietary intakes of LA and ALA, FADS1 rs174547 genotypes, lipid and anthropometric variables were determined in three French population-based samples (n = 3069). These samples were stratified according to the median dietary LA (<9.5 and ≥9.5 g/d) and ALA (<0.80 and ≥0.80 g/d) intakes. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect.Our meta-analysis confirmed the association between rs174547 and plasma lipid levels and revealed an association with waist circumference and body mass index. These associations were not modified by dietary ALA intake (all p-interaction > 0.05). In contrast, the associations with HDL-cholesterol levels, waist circumference and BMI were modulated by the dietary intake of LA (p interaction < 0.05). In high LA consumers only, the rs174547 minor allele was significantly associated with lower HDL-cholesterol levels (β = -0.05 mmol/L, p = 0.0002). Furthermore, each copy of the rs174547 minor allele was associated with a 1.58 cm lower waist circumference (p = 0.0005) and a 0.46 kg m lower BMI (p = 0.01) in the low LA intake group, but not in the high LA intake group.The present study suggests that dietary LA intake may modulate the association between the FADS gene variants and HDL-cholesterol concentration, waist circumference and BMI. These gene-nutrient interactions, if confirmed, suggest that subjects carrying the rs174547 minor allele might benefit from low dietary LA intakes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

In rats fed sesamin-free diets, GLA oil, compared with other oils, increased the activity and mRNA levels of various enzymes involved in fatty  oxidation, except for some instances. Sesamin greatly increased these parameters, and the enhancing effects of sesamin on peroxisomal fatty  oxidation rate and acyl-CoA oxidase, enoyl-CoA hydratase and acyl-CoA thioesterase activities were more exaggerated in rats fed GLA oil than in the animals fed other oils. The combination of sesamin and GLA oil also synergistically increased the mRNA levels of some peroxisomal fatty  oxidation enzymes and of several enzymes involved in fatty  metabolism located in other cell organelles. In the groups fed sesamin-free diets, GLA oil, compared with other oils, markedly reduced the activity and mRNA levels of various lipogenic enzymes. Sesamin reduced all these parameters, except for malic enzyme, in rats fed palm and safflower oils, but the effects were attenuated in the animals fed GLA oil.

PUFAs in membrane phospholipids are substrates for ROS-induced peroxidation reactions. We investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities in rat cerebrum, liver and uterus. Pups born from dams fed a diet low in omega-3 PUFAs were fed at weaning a diet supplying low α- (ALA), adequate ALA or enriched with eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic  (DHA). Malondialdehyde (MDA), a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, and the activities of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), SOD2, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were determined in the three target organs. Compared to low ALA feeding, supplementation with adequate ALA or with EPA+DHA did not affect the cerebrum MDA content but increased MDA content in liver. Uterine MDA was increased by the EPA+DHA diet. Supplementation with adequate ALA or EPA+DHA increased SOD2 activity in the liver and uterus, while only the DHA diet increased SOD2 activity in the cerebrum.

By contrast, ssi2 plants are compromised in the induction of the jasmonic  (JA)-responsive gene PDF1.2 and in resistance to the necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Although S-ACP-DES catalyzes the initial desaturation step required for JA biosynthesis, a mutation in ssi2 does not alter the levels of the JA precursor  (18:3), the perception of JA or ethylene, or the induced endogenous levels of JA. This finding led us to postulate that the S-ACP-DES-derived fatty  (FA) 18:1 or its derivative is required for the activation of certain JA-mediated responses and the repression of the salicylic  (SA) signaling pathway. Here, we report that alteration of the prokaryotic FA signaling pathway in plastids, leading to increased levels of 18:1, is required for the rescue of ssi2-triggered phenotypes. 18:1 levels in ssi2 plants were increased by performing epistatic analyses between ssi2 and several mutants in FA pathways that cause an increase in the levels of 18:1 in specific compartments of the cell. A loss-of-function mutation in the soluble chloroplastic enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (ACT1) completely reverses SA- and JA-mediated phenotypes in ssi2. In contrast to the act1 mutation, a loss-of-function mutation in the endoplasmic reticulum-localized omega6 oleate desaturase (FAD2) does not alter SA- or JA-related phenotypes of ssi2. However, a mutation in the plastidial membrane-localized omega6 desaturase (FAD6) mediates a partial rescue of ssi2-mediated phenotypes. Although ssi2 fad6 plants are rescued in their morphological phenotypes, including larger size, absence of visible lesions, and straight leaves, these plants continue to exhibit microscopic cell death and express the PR-1 gene constitutively. In addition, these plants are unable to induce the expression of PDF1.2 in response to the exogenous application of JA. Because the act1 mutation rescues all of these phenotypes in ssi2 fad6 act1 triple-mutant plants, act1-mediated reversion may be mediated largely by an increase in the free 18:1 content within the chloroplasts. The reversion of JA responsiveness in ssi2 act1 plants is abolished in the ssi2 act1 coi1 triple-mutant background, suggesting that both JA- and act1-generated signals are required for the expression of the JA-inducible PDF1.2 gene. Our conclusion that FA signaling in plastids plays an essential role in the regulation of SSI2-mediated defense signaling is further substantiated by the fact that overexpression of the N-terminal-deleted SSI2, which lacks the putative plastid-localizing transit peptide, is unable to rescue ssi2-triggered phenotypes, as opposed to overexpression of the full-length protein.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693871>The onset of grapevine berry ripening is characterized by ROS accumulation and lipoxygenase-mediated membrane peroxidation in the skin.</a></h2><p>The ripening of fleshy fruits is a complex developmental program characterized by extensive transcriptomic and metabolic remodeling in the pericarp tissues (pulp and skin) making unripe green fruits soft, tasteful and colored. The onset of ripening is regulated by a plethora of endogenous signals tuned to external stimuli. In grapevine and tomato, which are classified as non-climacteric and climacteric species respectively, the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and extensive modulation of reactive  species (ROS) scavenging enzymes at the onset of ripening has been reported, suggesting that ROS could participate to the regulatory network of fruit development. In order to investigate this hypothesis, a comprehensive biochemical study of the oxidative events occurring at the beginning of ripening in Vitis vinifera cv. Pinot Noir has been undertaken.ROS-specific staining allowed to visualize not only H2O2 but also singlet  (1O2) in berry skin cells just before color change in distinct subcellular locations, i.e. cytosol and plastids. H2O2 peak in sample skins at véraison was confirmed by in vitro quantification and was supported by the concomitant increase of catalase activity. Membrane peroxidation was also observed by HPLC-MS on galactolipid species at véraison. Mono- and digalactosyl diacylglycerols were found peroxidized on one or both α- fatty  chains, with a 13(S) absolute configuration implying the action of a specific enzyme. A lipoxygenase (PnLOXA), expressed at véraison and localizing inside the chloroplasts, was indeed able to catalyze membrane galactolipid peroxidation when overexpressed in tobacco leaves.The present work demonstrates the controlled, harmless accumulation of specific ROS in distinct cellular compartments, i.e. cytosol and chloroplasts, at a definite developmental stage, the onset of grape berry ripening. These features strongly candidate ROS as cellular signals in fruit ripening and encourage further studies to identify downstream elements of this cascade. This paper also reports the transient galactolipid peroxidation carried out by a véraison-specific chloroplastic lipoxygenase.

Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms still poorly elucidated. The aim of this study is to comprehensively demonstrate the effects of PLA on oleic acid (OA)-induced non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and their relationship with the lipid metabolic regulation. The results demonstrated that treatment with PLA dramatically inhibited lipid accumulation, oxidative stress as well as inflammatory responses induced by oleic acid in HepG2 cells. PLA also obviously decreased the levels of cellular triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). As well as PLA stilled promoted the antioxidant enzymes activity including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Furthermore, PLA could increase the expressions of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase1 (HO-1) to alleviate oxidative damage. It also could reduce lipogenesis-related transcription factors expression, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1c),  acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). PLA treatment resulted in increasing phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) expression.

Polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) metabolism is modulated in . However, it has yet to be fully elucidated whether a serum PUFA profile is associated with hepatic steatosis.We aimed to clarify the relationship between a serum PUFA profile and liver lipid content.A cross-sectional study was conducted on 288 patients with dyslipidemia, diabetes, or coronary artery disease on statin therapy. Several PUFAs were measured, including eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), dihomo-γ- (DGLA) and arachidonic  (AA) in serum lipids, and Δ-5 desaturase (D5D) activity was estimated by AA to DGLA ratio. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) measured visceral fat area (VFA) and the ratio of CT attenuation for liver to spleen (L/S).The L/S ratio showed significant correlations with serum DGLA level and D5D activity (p<0.0001 for both). Serum DGLA level and D5D activity were significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI) or VFA, and with Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (p<0.0001 for all). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that a high DGLA level or low D5D activity was a significant determinant for hepatic steatosis (p<0.0001 for both) independent of BMI and HOMA-IR. ROC analysis revealed that they significantly enhanced the value of MetS-related factors in predicting hepatic steatosis (p<0.05 for both).A high DGLA level and low D5D activity in serum lipids may be useful markers predicting hepatic steatosis incrementally to MetS-related conventional factors.Copyright © 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of .

The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of different drying on retention of bioactive molecules, such as omega-3 fatty acids, total phenolic content and antiradical activity of purslane. Five different dehydration methods including microwave (100 MW, 5 min), tray, vacuum, low temperature low humidity, infrared were used at 55-60 °C for 5-7 h for dehydration of purslane. Three solvents, viz. water, ethanol and methanol were used for extraction of bioactive molecules from purslane. Total polyphenol content, antiradical activity and rehydration ratio of the bioactive molecules were determined. Results revealed that total PUFA, α- (ALA), total polyphenol content and antiradical activity were found to retain in the dried purslane in the range of (47.9-59.9 %), (42.5-50 %), (188-408GAE/100 g) and (33.0-88.8 mg/100 g) respectively. The highest values of ALA, total polyphenol content and antiradical activity were found to obtain in the vacuum dried sample. Rehydration ratio was found in the range of 3.2-4.3 and vacuum dried purslane showed maximum rehydration. It could be concluded that vacuum dehydration of purslane is an effective method for retention of bioactive molecules and good rehydration behaviour of dried purslane.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26666272>Study on Synthesis, Characterization and Antiproliferative Activity of Novel Diisopropylphenyl Esters of Selected  .</a></h2><p>The present study describes the synthesis, characterization and evaluation of antiproliferative activity of novel diisopropylphenyl esters of  (ALA), valproic  (VA), butyric  (BA) and 2-ethylhexanoic  (2-EHA).

The results are compared to BDEs obtained from experiments and to Oyeyemi et al.'s multireference averaged coupled pair functional (MRACPF2) calculations. We found that with extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit, the BDEs derived from coupled cluster calculations with single, double, and triple excitations (CCSDT) and from CCSDT with a perturbative treatment of connected quadruple excitations, CCSDT(2)Q/CBS, are closer to the available experimental values than those obtained by MRACPF2 for propene and methyl formate. The CCSDT/CBS calculations were chosen as the reference for validating the DFT methods. Among the density functionals, we found that M08-HX has the best performance with a mean unsigned deviation (MUD) from CCSDT/CBS of only 1.0 kcal/mol, whereas the much more expensive MRACPF2 has an MUD of 1.1 kcal/mol.

This work was aimed at evaluating the effect of heat-drying (HD) and freeze-drying (FD) on the phytochemical and fatty  profiles of alfalfa and flax sprouts, as compared to fresh material.Both FD and HD reduced the phytochemical contents compared to fresh sprouts. FD better preserved phytoestrogens, phytosterols and total tocols compared to HD. However, phytoestrogen and tocol content remained quite high also in HD. The fatty  profile was affected only by sprouts species, with higher amounts of α- in flax and linoleic  in alfalfa sprouts.This work demonstrates that drying does not severely compromise the nutritional value of sprouts and provides a valid support for the choice of the drying method depending on the compound to be preserved, and taking into consideration the different cost of the methods.

Selected nutrient intakes (total fat, saturated fat plus trans fat, , total long chain omega 3 fatty acids, fibre and sodium) collected by repeated 24 h recalls were compared to national dietary recommendations and to the intakes of all other adults and children surveyed. Standard errors of the estimates were calculated using the replicate weights method, and an alpha value of <0.05 considered statistically significant.Six thousand two hundred sixty five of 9435 adults surveyed were identified as having CVD risk factors or established disease and of these 1609 had a child in the same household that also contributed data in this survey. No differences were observed in adjusted mean dietary intakes between those without risk factors or established CVD and those with, except for total  and sodium which were significantly lower in the adults with CVD risk factors and/or established disease.

Chia seed is an ancient seed and is the richest plant source of α-. We aimed to determine how cellular senescence markers will be altered in adipose tissue of senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice fed with high-fat diets (HFDs); and how chia seed can affect the above markers. SAMP8 mice and their control senescence-accelerated mouse-resistant 1 (SAMR1) were divided into four groups, that is, SAMR1 low-fat diet group (R1LF), SAMP8LF group (P8LF), SAMP8 high-fat group (P8HF), and SAMP8HF group supplemented with 10% chia seed (P8HC). At the end of the intervention, body composition was measured through T-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and epididymal (EPI) and subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissues were dissected for further analysis. Compared with the R1LF group, the P8HF and P8HC groups had significantly increased body fat mass. In EPI fat, p16, CD68 and PAI-1 mRNA expression from P8HF group were significantly increased; chia seed partially reduced p16 and CD68 mRNA expression. The P8LF group has increased p16 and CD68, and the P8HF group has increased p16, p21, and CD68; and P8HC group has increased p16 mRNA expression. The protein expression of p-AMPK in EPI and SC fat from the P8HF group was reduced.

In rat assays, significant reductions were observed in protein efficiency ratio, net protein ratio, net protein utilization, biological value and true nitrogen digestibility, especially when the reaction had taken place at high moisture content, high temperature and in the presence of excess oxygen. The losses of bioavailable lysine and tryptophan as measured by rat assays followed a similar pattern. The chemical value of each amino acid multiplied by the true N digestibility closely resembled the rat assay value. In general, the reaction products of lysine and tryptophan formed during  oxidation were biologically unavailable. The bioavailabilities of methionine and of 'methionine plus cyst(e)ine' were determined in separate assays. Cyst(e)ine was calculated as 'methionine plus cyst(e)ine' minus methionine.

The biosynthesis of the two main endocannabinoids, N-arachidonoylethanolamine and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol, which derive from arachidonic , is influenced by dietary fatty acids (FAs). We investigated whether exposure to n-3 FA at a young age may decrease tissue endocannabinoid levels and prevent metabolic disorders induced by a later high-fat diet (HFD) challenge. Three-week-old mice received a 5% lipid diet containing lard, lard plus safflower oil, or lard plus linseed oil for 10 weeks. Then, mice were challenged with a 30% lard diet for 10 additional weeks. A low n-6/n-3 FA ratio in the early diet induces a marked decrease in liver endocannabinoid levels. A similar reduction was observed in transgenic Fat-1 mice, which exhibit high tissue levels of n-3 FA compared with wild-type mice. Hepatic expression of key enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism was concomitantly changed. Interestingly, some gene modifications persisted after HFD challenge and were associated with improved glycemic control. These findings indicate that early dietary interventions based on n-3 FA may represent an alternative strategy to drugs for reducing endocannabinoid tone and improving metabolic parameters in the metabolic syndrome.© 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

Respecting the immune-modulative role of lipid mediators in bronchoconstriction, airway  and resolution of inflammatory processes, LCPUFAs play an important role in asthma. To design a disease-specific and most beneficial LCPUFA supplementation strategy, it is essential to understand how asthma alters LCPUFA profiles. Therefore, this study characterizes the alterations of LCPUFA profiles induced by allergic asthma. In addition, this study explores whether a simple eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) alone or a specific combined LCPUFA supplementation could restore imbalanced LCPUFA profiles.Mice were sensitized with a daily dose of 40 μg house dust mite (HDM)-extract in a recall model and fed with either normal diet, EPA or a specific combined (sc)-LCPUFA supplementation containing EPA, docosahexaenoic  (DHA), γ - (GLA) and stearidonic  (SDA) for 24 days. After recall with HDM, mice were sacrificed and blood and lung tissue were collected. Fatty  profiles were determined in plasma, blood cells and lung cells of asthmatic mice by capillary gas-chromatography.In lung cells of asthmatic mice, arachidonic  (AA, p < 0.001) and DHA (p < 0.01) were increased while dihomo-γ- (DGLA, p < 0.05) was decreased. EPA supplementation increased only EPA (p < 0.001) and docosapentaenoic  (DPA, p < 0.001), but neither DGLA nor DHA in lung cells of asthmatic mice. In contrast, a specific combined dietary supplementation containing n-3 and n-6 LCPUFAs could decrease AA (p < 0.001), increase EPA (p < 0.001), DPA (p < 0.001) and DHA (p < 0.01) and could reverse the lack of DGLA (p < 0.05).In summary, allergic asthma alters LCPUFA profiles in blood and lung tissue. In contrast to the EPA supplementation, the distinct combination of n-3 and n-6 LCPUFAs restored the LCPUFA profiles in lung tissue of asthmatic mice completely.

Their biotransmission through the food chain constitutes a potential risk for human health. Plants as principal actors in the food chain can play a determinant role in removing dioxins from the environment. Due to the lack of data on dioxin/plant research, this study sets out to determine few responsive reactions adopted by Arabidopsis plant towards 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), the most toxic congener of dioxins.Using a high resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we demonstrated that Arabidopsis plant uptakes TCDD by the roots and accumulates it in the vegetative parts in a tissue-specific manner. TCDD mainly accumulated in rosette leaves and mature seeds and less in stem, flowers and immature siliques. Moreover, we observed that plants exposed to high doses of TCDD exhibited a delay in flowering and yielded fewer seeds of a reduced oil content with a low vitality. A particular focus on the plant fatty  metabolism showed that TCDD caused a significant reduction in C18-unsaturated fatty  level in plant tissues. Simultaneously, TCDD induced the expression of 9-LOX and 13-LOX genes and the formation of their corresponding hydroperoxides, 9- and 13-HPOD as well as 9- or 13-HPOT, derived from linoleic and  acids, respectively.The current work highlights a side of toxicological effects resulting in the administration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD on the Arabidopsis plant. Similarly to animals, it seems that plants may accumulate TCDD in their lipids by involving few of the FA-metabolizing enzymes for sculpting a specific oxylipins "signature" typified to plant TCDD-tolerance. Together, our results uncover novel responses of Arabidopsis to dioxin, possibly emerging to overcome its toxicity.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21481031>Antagonistic role of 9-lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins and ethylene in the control of oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and plant defence.</a></h2><p>9-lipoxygenases (9-LOXs) initiate fatty  oxygenation in plant tissues, with formation of 9-hydroxy-10,12,15-octadecatrienoic  (9-HOT) from . A lox1 lox5 mutant, which is deficient in 9-LOX activity, and two mutants noxy6 and noxy22 (non-responding to oxylipins), which are insensitive to 9-HOT, have been used to investigate 9-HOT signalling. Map-based cloning indicated that the noxy6 and noxy22 mutations are located at the CTR1 (CONSTITUTIVE ETHYLENE RESPONSE1) and ETO1 (ETHYLENE-OVERPRODUCER1) loci, respectively. In agreement, the noxy6 and noxy22 mutants, renamed as ctr1-15 and eto1-14, respectively, showed enhanced ethylene (ET) production. The correlation between increased ET production and reduced 9-HOT sensitivity indicated by these results was supported by experiments in which exogenously added ethylene precursor ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic ) impaired the responses to 9-HOT. Moreover, a reciprocal interaction between ET and 9-HOT signalling was indicated by results showing that the effect of ACC was reduced in the presence of 9-HOT. We found that the 9-LOX and ET pathways regulate the response to the lipid peroxidation-inducer singlet . Thus, the massive transcriptional changes seen in wild-type plants in response to singlet  were greatly affected in the lox1 lox5 and eto1-14 mutants. Furthermore, these mutants displayed enhanced susceptibility to both singlet  and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, in the latter case leading to increased accumulation of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde. These findings demonstrate an antagonistic relationship between products of the 9-LOX and ET pathways, and suggest a role for the 9-LOX pathway in modulating oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and plant defence.© 2011 The Authors.

Multivariable-adjusted regression models were used to estimate associations between erythrocyte LCω-3PUFA and breast tissue biomarkers. Women in the highest erythrocyte LCω-3PUFA tertile had LCω-3PUFA concentrations in the breast 73% (95% CI: 31-128%; p trend < 0.0001) higher than women in the lowest tertile. Associations for each individual LCω-3PUFA were similar in magnitude. No significant association was found for the shorter ω-3 PUFA, α-.

Human endothelial cells were cultured with either culture medium or culture medium supplemented with ALA, LA or various ratios of LA:ALA (1:4, 1:1, 4:1, 9:1 or 19:1) followed by 24 h TNF-α stimulation; the total concentration of ALA plus LA was kept constant at 100 μM. The incorporation and metabolism of ALA and LA was measured using gas chromatography. The production of inflammatory mediators in the supernatant was assessed using a Luminex Multi-Analyte kit. Both ALA and LA were incorporated and metabolised by the endothelial cells. Cells incubated with ALA had a statistically significantly lower production of VEGF, RANTES, ICAM-1, MCP-1 and IL-6 compared to cells incubated without additional ALA. LA was not found to exert pro-inflammatory effects. Cells incubated with low LA:ALA ratios had lower production of VEGF, RANTES, MCP-1 and IL-6 when compared with a LA:ALA ratio of 19:1. These findings suggest that a low LA:ALA ratio exerts anti-inflammatory effects by lowering the production VEGF, RANTES, ICAM-1, MCP-1 and IL-6 in TNF-α stimulated endothelial cells compared to a high ratio. These effects were likely mediated by ALA, but LA may also possess some anti-inflammatory effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that plasma concentrations of n-3 PUFAs would be lower and those of n-6 PUFAs higher in subjects with bipolar disorder (BD) compared to healthy controls (HCs), and would correlate with symptom severity in subjects with BD, and that effective treatment would correlate with increased n-3 but lower n-6 PUFA levels. Additionally, we explored clinical correlations and group differences in plasma levels of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids.This observational, parallel group study compared biomarkers between HCs (n = 31) and symptomatic subjects with BD (n = 27) when ill and after symptomatic recovery (follow-up). Plasma concentrations of five PUFAs [linoleic  (LA), arachidonic  (AA),  (ALA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)], two saturated fatty acids (palmitic  and stearic ) and two monounsaturated fatty acids (palmitoleic  and oleic ) were measured in esterified (E) and unesterified (UE) forms.

Comparisons of plasma fatty  levels and ratios between BD and HC groups were made with Student t-tests, and between the BD group at baseline and follow-up using paired t-tests. Comparison of categorical variables was performed using chi-square tests. Pearson's r was used for bivariate correlations with clinical variables, including depressive and manic symptoms, current panic attacks, and psychosis.UE EPA was lower in subjects with BD than in HCs, with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.86, p < 0.002); however, it was not statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons. No statistically significant difference was seen in any plasma PUFA concentration between the BD and HC groups after Bonferroni correction for 40 comparisons, at p < 0.001. Neither depressive severity nor mania severity was correlated significantly with any PUFA concentration. Exploratory comparison showed lower UE:E EPA in the BD than the HC group (p < 0.0001). At follow-up in the BD group, UE, E DHA:ALA, and UE EPA:ALA were decreased (p < 0.002). Exploratory correlations of clinical variables revealed that mania severity and suicidality were positively correlated with UE:E EPA ratio, and that several plasma levels and ratios correlated with panic disorder and psychosis. Depressive severity was not correlated with any ratio. No plasma fatty  level or ratio correlated with self-reported n-3 PUFA intake or use of medication by class.A large effect size of reduced UE EPA, and a lower plasma UE:E concentration ratio of EPA in the symptomatic BD state may be important factors in vulnerability to a mood state. Altered n-3 PUFA ratios could indicate changes in PUFA metabolism concurrent with symptom improvement. Our findings are consistent with preclinical and postmortem data and suggest testing interventions that increase n-3 and decrease n-6 dietary PUFA intake.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In nature, swallows () and other aerial insectivores feed on both aquatic insects, which are rich in omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs), and terrestrial insects, which contain considerably lower amounts of omega-3 HUFAs. Carnivorous mammals and fishes must obtain omega-3 HUFAs from their diet, as they have lost the capacity to convert the precursor omega-3 α- (ALA) into omega-3 HUFAs. Thus, the relative value of aquatic versus terrestrial insects depends not only on the fatty  composition of the prey but also on the capacity of consumers to convert ALA into omega-3 HUFAs. We used a combination of stable-isotope-labeled fatty  tracers to ask whether, and how efficiently, tree swallows can deposit newly synthesized omega-3 HUFAs into tissue. Our data show for the first time that tree swallows can convert ALA into omega-3 HUFAs deposited in liver and skeletal muscle. However, high tree swallow demand for omega-3 HUFAs combined with low ALA availability in natural terrestrial foods may strain their modest conversion ability. This suggests that while tree swallows can synthesize omega-3 HUFAs , omega-3 HUFAs are ecologically essential nutrients in natural systems.

In this study, we show that chloroplasts are major organelles in which malondialdehyde (MDA) generated from peroxidized  modifies proteins in heat-stressed plants. First, to clarify the biochemical process of MDA generation from PUFAs and its attachment to proteins, we carried out in vitro experiments using model proteins (BSA and Rubisco) and methylesters of C18 PUFAs that are major components of plant biomembrane. Protein modification was detected by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies that recognize MDA binding to proteins. Results showed that peroxidation of  methylester by reactive  species was essential for protein modification by MDA, and the MDA modification was highly dependent on temperature, leading to a loss of Rubisco activity. When isolated spinach thylakoid membrane was peroxidized at 37 degrees C, -evolving complex 33kDa protein (OEC33) was modified by MDA.

The hamsters received four different diets for a 20-week period, as follows: i) Groups C and DM received a high-fat diet (40% energy as fat), deficient in α- (ALA); ii) the DM + Flax group received a high-fat diet enriched with ground flaxseed 15 g/100 g of food, rich in ALA; iii) the DM + E group received a high-fat diet enriched with vitamin E, 40 mg α-tocopherol/100 g of food; and iv) the DM + Flax + E group received a high-fat diet enriched with flaxseed and vitamin E. The results of serum lipid and oxidative stress analysis suggested that the antiatherogenic effect of flaxseed, α-tocopherol and their combination added to a high-fat diet in diabetic hamsters was based primarily on their antioxidative role, demonstrated by decreased serum lipid peroxidation and increased liver glutathione content. Improvements of serum glucose and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were observed and may have contributed to the prevention of diabetic macroangiopathy evidenced in the histopathological examination. The antioxidant effect of flaxseed was similar to that of α-tocopherol in diabetic hamsters fed a high-fat diet and combined supplementation did not appear to bring more benefits than flaxseed alone. Moreover, the high dose of ground flaxseed alone may have a better cardioprotective effect than α-tocopherol in diabetic hamsters by reducing total cholesterol and non-HDL-C levels and increasing HDL-C levels.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25789320>: an omega-3 fatty  with neuroprotective properties-ready for use in the stroke clinic?</a></h2><p> (ALA) is plant-based essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids that must be obtained through the diet. This could explain in part why the severe deficiency in omega-3 intake pointed by numerous epidemiologic studies may increase the brain's vulnerability representing an important risk factor in the development and/or deterioration of certain cardio- and neuropathologies. The roles of ALA in neurological disorders remain unclear, especially in stroke that is a leading cause of death. We and others have identified ALA as a potential nutraceutical to protect the brain from stroke, characterized by its pleiotropic effects in neuroprotection, vasodilation of brain arteries, and neuroplasticity. This review highlights how chronic administration of ALA protects against rodent models of hypoxic-ischemic injury and exerts an anti-depressant-like activity, effects that likely involve multiple mechanisms in brain, and may be applied in stroke prevention. One major effect may be through an increase in mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a widely expressed protein in brain that plays critical roles in neuronal maintenance, and learning and memory. Understanding the precise roles of ALA in neurological disorders will provide the underpinnings for the development of new therapies for patients and families who could be devastated by these disorders.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27083549>Gamma-, Dihommo-gamma , Eicosanoids and Inflammatory Processes.</a></h2><p>Gamma- (GLA, 18:3n-6) is an omega-6 (n-6), 18 carbon (18C-) polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) found in human milk and several botanical seed oils and is typically consumed as part of a dietary supplement. While there have been numerous in vitro and in vivo animal models which illustrate that GLA-supplemented diets attenuate inflammatory responses, clinical studies utilizing GLA or GLA in combination with omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs have been much less conclusive. A central premise of this review is that there are critical metabolic and genetic factors that affect the conversion of GLA to dihommo-gamma  (DGLA, 20:3n-6) and arachidonic  (AA, 20:4n-6), which consequently affects the balance of DGLA- and AA- derived metabolites. As a result, these factors impact the clinical effectiveness of GLA or GLA/(n-3) PUFA supplementations in treating inflammatory conditions. Specifically, these factors include: 1) the capacity for different human cells and tissues to convert GLA to DGLA and AA and to metabolize DGLA and AA to bioactive metabolites; 2) the opposing effects of DGLA and AA metabolites on inflammatory processes and diseases; and 3) the impact of genetic variations within the fatty  desaturase (FADS) gene cluster, in particular, on AA/DGLA ratios and bioactive metabolites. We postulate that these factors influence the heterogeneity of results observed in GLA supplement-based clinical trials and suggest that "one-size fits all" approaches utilizing PUFA-based supplements may no longer be appropriate for the prevention and treatment of complex human diseases.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, girdling inhibits carbohydrate transport to the root in nearly all of the fruit development periods and consequently decreases root absorption. The mechanism through which carbohydrates regulate root development in arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) remains largely unknown. Carbohydrate content, AM , and transcriptome in the roots were analyzed to elucidate the interaction between host litchi and AM fungi when carbohydrate content decreases. Girdling decreased glucose, fructose, sucrose, quebrachitol, and starch contents in the litchi mycorrhizal roots, thereby reducing AM . RNA-seq achieved approximately 60 million reads of each sample, with an average length of reads reaching 100 bp. Assembly of all the reads of the 30 samples produced 671,316 transcripts and 381,429 unigenes, with average lengths of 780 and 643 bp, respectively. Litchi (54,100 unigenes) and AM fungi unigenes (33,120 unigenes) were achieved through sequence annotation during decreased carbohydrate content. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG) showed that flavonoids, , and linoleic  are the main factors that regulate AM  in litchi. However, flavonoids may play a role in detecting the stage at which carbohydrate content decreases;  or linoleic  may affect AM formation under the adaptation process. Litchi trees stimulated the expression of defense-related genes and downregulated symbiosis signal-transduction genes to inhibit new AM . Moreover, transcription factors of the AP2, ERF, Myb, WRKY, bHLH families, and lectin genes altered maintenance of litchi mycorrhizal roots in the post-symbiotic stage for carbohydrate starvation. Similar to those of the litchi host, the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF subunit scon-3 and polyubiquitin of AM fungi were upregulated at the perceived stages. This occurrence suggested that ubiquitination plays an important role in perceiving carbohydrate decrease in AM fungi. The transcription of cytochrome b-245 and leucine-rich repeat was detected in the DEG database, implying that the transcripts were involved in AM fungal adaptation under carbohydrate starvation. The transcriptome data might suggest novel functions of unigenes in carbohydrate shortage of mycorrhizal roots.</p><p>Keyword:['colonization']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30202434>Engineering the fatty  synthesis pathway in  PCC 7942 improves omega-3 fatty  production.</a></h2><p>The microbial production of fatty acids has received great attention in the last few years as feedstock for the production of renewable .

Fatty  synthesis is a ubiquitous and well-characterized pathway in most bacteria. However, the activity of the enzymes involved in this pathway in cyanobacteria remains poorly explored.To characterize the function of some enzymes involved in the saturated fatty  synthesis in cyanobacteria, we genetically engineered  PCC 7942 by overexpressing or deleting genes encoding enzymes of the fatty  synthase system and tested the lipid profile of the mutants.

Western diets generally provide a 10 to 20-fold deficit in omega-3 PUFAs compared with omega-6, and this is thought to have contributed to the marked rise in incidence of disorders of modern human societies, such as heart disease, colitis and perhaps osteoporosis. Many of our food production animals, fed on grains rich in omega-6, are also exposed to a dietary deficit in omega-3, with perhaps similar health consequences. Bone fragility due to osteoporotic changes in laying hens is a major economic and welfare problem, with our recent estimates of breakage rates indicating up to 95% of free range hens suffer breaks during lay.Free range hens housed in full scale commercial systems were provided diets supplemented with omega-3 , and the skeletal benefits were investigated by comparison to standard diets rich in omega-6.There was a significant 40-60% reduction in keel bone breakage rate, and a corresponding reduction in breakage severity in the omega-3 supplemented hens. There was significantly greater bone density and bone mineral content, alongside increases in total bone and trabecular volumes. The mechanical properties of the omega-3 supplemented hens were improved, with strength, energy to break and stiffness demonstrating significant increases. Alkaline phosphatase (an osteoblast marker) and tartrate-resistant  phosphatase (an osteoclast marker) both showed significant increases with the omega-3 diets, indicating enhanced bone turnover. This was corroborated by the significantly lower levels of the mature collagen crosslinks, hydroxylysyl pyridinoline, lysyl pyridinoline and histidinohydroxy-lysinonorleucine, with a corresponding significant shift in the mature:immature crosslink ratio.The improved skeletal health in laying hens corresponds to as many as 68million fewer hens suffering keel fractures in the EU each year. The biomechanical and biochemical evidence suggests that increased bone turnover has enhanced the bone mechanical properties, and that this may suggest potential benefits for human osteoporosis.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this report, we investigate the effects of the immediate (DGLA, precursor to PGE1), arachidonic  (AA, PGE precursors, dihomogamma  (DGLA, precursor to PGE1), arachidonic  (AA, precursor to PGE2), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, precursor to PGE3) on IL-2 production by PHA-stimulated human PBMC. DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production in a dose-dependent manner: half-maximal inhibition was obtained by using the fatty acids at the dose of 10 micrograms/ml without significant effects on cell viability. EPA inhibited IL-2 production by PBMC of only some donors. Incubation of cells in the presence of oleic, stearic, and palmitic acids, which are not PG precursors, did not affect mitogen-induced IL-2 production. A progressive increase in incorporation of DGLA into cellular lipids was observed over a 48-h incubation period. IL-2 production was reduced also when PBMC were pretreated overnight with DGLA or AA and washed before exposure to PHA. Whereas addition of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, at the time of mitogenic stimulation led to increased IL-2 production and prevented mitogen- and fatty -induced increases in PGE release, it had no significant effect on the capacity of the fatty acids to suppress IL-2 production. Time course experiments showed that DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production even at times of minimal or no PGE release by the treated cultures. Moreover, DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production by the human leukemia T cell line Jurkat which, when appropriately induced, is able to release high levels of IL-2 in the absence of accessory cells and measurable PGE production. Taken together, these data indicate that essential fatty acids inhibit IL-2 production directly without conversion into their cyclo-oxygenase pathway products, and suggest that human lymphocyte function may be altered profoundly by small changes in their fatty  profile.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26996439>Overview of Flaxseed Patent Applications for the Reduction of Cholesterol Levels.</a></h2><p>Flaxseed is becoming an increasingly widely used food ingredient.

Some plants belonging to the genus  L. are characterized by biological activity. Therefore, studies were conducted to determine the dependence of biological activity on the chemical composition of various parts of the evening primrose, mainly leaves, stems, and seeds. Common components of all parts of the  plants are fatty acids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. In contrast, primrose seeds also contain proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. Therefore, it is believed that the most interesting sources of biologically active compounds are the seeds and, above all, evening primrose seed oil. This oil contains mainly aliphatic alcohols, fatty acids, sterols, and polyphenols. Evening primrose oil (EPO) is extremely high in linoleic  (LA) (70⁻74%) and γ- (GLA) (8⁻10%), which may contribute to the proper functioning of human tissues because they are precursors of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. EPO supplementation results in an increase in plasma levels of γ- and its metabolite dihomo-γ- (DGLA). This compound is oxidized by lipoxygenase (15-LOX) to 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic  (15-HETrE) or, under the influence of cyclooxygenase (COX), DGLA is metabolized to series 1 prostaglandins. These compounds have anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties. Furthermore, 15-HETrE blocks the conversion of arachidonic  (AA) to leukotriene A₄ (LTA₄) by direct inhibition of 5-LOX. In addition, γ- suppresses inflammation mediators such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and cytokine - tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α).

Previous studies have indicated that neurodevelopment may also be impaired through alternative pathways, including reduction of cAMP catalyzed downstream events. The upstream initiating events that underlie non-cholinergic neurological actions of chlorpyrifos and other organophosphorus compounds remain unclear. To investigate the potential role of disruption of fatty  signaling as a mechanism of toxicity,  and fatty  profiles were examined to identify alterations that may play a critical role in upstream signaling in the CNS. Juvenile rainbow trout were treated for 7 days with nominal chlorpyrifos concentrations previously reported to diminish olfactory responses (10, 20, and 40 μg/L). While lethality was noted higher doses, measured chlorpyrifos concentrations of 1.38 μg/L (nominal concentration 10 μg/L) significantly reduced the activity of AChE and two serine lipases, monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty  amide hydrolase in the brain. Reductions in lysophosphatidylethanolamines (16:0; 18:0, 18:1, and 22:6) derived from the phosphatidylethanolamines and free fatty acids (Palmitic acid16:0;  acid18:3; Eicosadienoic  20:2; Arachidonic  20:4; and Docosahexaenoic  22:6) were also noted, suggesting that chlorpyrifos inhibited the  of selected phospholipid signaling precursors at sublethal concentrations.

Deuterium-labeled fatty acids, (16,16,16-D(3))-hexadecanoic  and (Z)-[13,13,14,14,15,15,16,16,16-D(9)]-11-hexadecenoic , were incorporated into 11Z,13Z-16:Ald after topical application to the sex pheromone gland coupled with abdominal injection of PBAN. Deuterium label was incorporated into the C(23) and C(25) pentaenes after injection of (9Z,12Z,15Z)- [17,17,18,18,18-D(5)]-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic  into 1-2 d old female pupae. These labeling results, in conjunction with the composition of fatty  intermediates found in pheromone gland extracts, support different pathways leading to the two pheromone components. 11Z,13Z-16:Ald is probably produced in the pheromone gland by Delta11 desaturation of palmitic  to 11Z-16: followed by a second desaturation to form 11Z,13Z-16: and subsequent reduction and oxidation. The production of 3Z,6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z-23:H and 3Z,6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z-25:H may take place outside the pheromone gland, and appears to start from , which is elongated and desaturated to form (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-5,8,11,14,17-icosapentaenoic , followed by two or three further elongation steps and finally reductive decarboxylation.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10507617>Effect of short-term enteral feeding with eicosapentaenoic and gamma- acids on alveolar macrophage eicosanoid synthesis and bactericidal function in rats.</a></h2><p>Because vasoactive eicosanoids derived from arachidonic  present in immune cell phospholipids promote lung inflammation in critically ill patients, novel experimental diets containing eicosapentaenoic  from fish oil and gamma- from borage oil have been designed to limit arachidonic  metabolism.

Macrophages from rats given the eicosapentaenoic with gamma- diet released 35% or 24% more prostaglandin E1 than macrophages from rats given either the linoleic  or the eicosapentaenoic  diet, respectively. Macrophage superoxide generation, phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan, and killing of S. aureus were similar irrespective of dietary treatment.Short-term enteral feeding with an eicosapentaenoic -enriched or eicosapentaenoic with gamma--enriched diet rapidly modulated the fatty  composition of alveolar macrophage phospholipids, promoted a shift toward formation of less inflammatory eicosanoids by stimulated macrophages, but did not impair alveolar macrophage bactericidal function relative to responses observed after feeding a linoleic  diet.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29967047> Remodels Chloroplastic Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol by Liberating α- in Arabidopsis Leaves under Heat Stress.</a></h2><p>Under heat stress, polyunsaturated acyl groups, such as α-linolenate (18:3) and hexadecatrienoate (16:3), are removed from chloroplastic glycerolipids in various plant species. Here, we showed that a lipase designated HEAT INDUCIBLE LIPASE1 (HIL1) induces the catabolism of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) under heat stress in  leaves. Using thermotolerance tests, a T-DNA insertion mutant with disrupted  was shown to have a heat stress-sensitive phenotype. Lipidomic analysis indicated that the decrease of 34:6-MGDG under heat stress was partially impaired in the  mutant. Concomitantly, the heat-induced increment of 54:9-triacylglycerol in the  mutant was 18% lower than that in the wild-type plants. Recombinant HIL1 protein digested MGDG to produce 18:3-free fatty  (18:3-FFA), but not 18:0- and 16:0-FFAs. A transient assay using fluorescent fusion proteins confirmed chloroplastic localization of HIL1.

It has been shown that, compared with food-restricted rats refed a high-fat (lard) diet low in PUFA, those refed isoenergetically on diets enriched in LA or ALA, independently of the n-6:n-3 ratio, show improved  sensitivity, lower fat mass and higher lean mass, the magnitude of which is related to the proportion of total PUFA precursors (LA+ALA) consumed. These relationships are best fitted by quadratic regression models (r2>0·8, P < 0·001), with threshold values for an impact on body composition corresponding to PUFA precursors contributing 25-30 % of energy intake. Isoenergetic refeeding on high-fat diets enriched in AA or DHA also led to improved body composition, with increases in lean mass as predicted by the quadratic model for PUFA precursors, but decreases in fat mass, which are disproportionately greater than predicted values;  sensitivity, however, was not improved. These findings pertaining to the impact of dietary intake of PUFA precursors (LA and ALA) and their elongated-desaturated products (AA and DHA), on body composition and  sensitivity, provide important insights into the search for diets aimed at counteracting the pathophysiological consequences of catch-up growth.

Mother-child pairs ( = 78) were grouped per maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI): normal-weight (BMI = 18.5-24.99), overweight (BMI = 25-29.99) and obese (BMI > 30). Colostrum and mature milk FAs were determined. Infant anthropometry at 6, 18 and 36 months of age and cognition at 18 were analyzed. Mature milk exhibited lower arachidonic  (AA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), among others, than colostrum. Breast milk of non-normal weight mothers presented increased saturated FAs and n6:n3 ratio and decreased α- (ALA), DHA and monounsaturated FAs. Infant BMI-for-age at 6 months of age was inversely associated with colostrum n6 (e.g., AA) and n3 (e.g., DHA) FAs and positively associated with n6:n3 ratio. Depending on the maternal weight, infant cognition was positively influenced by breast milk linoleic , n6 PUFAs, ALA, DHA and n3 LC-PUFAs, and negatively affected by n6:n3 ratio.

Accumulating evidence suggests that GPR120 activation is a feasible solution to ameliorating chronic  and improving glucose metabolism. In this study we investigated whether ginsenoside Rb2 (Rb2), which exhibited regulatory activities in glucose and lipid metabolism, affected GPR120 expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells, and examined the contribution of GPR120 activation to reducing the LPS-induced inflammatory response. LPS (100 ng/mL) activated the macrophages, resulting in dramatic increases in TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and NO production. Treatment with a ω-3 fatty  α- (ALA, 50 μmol/L) produced moderate reduction in LPS-stimulated inflammatory cytokines and NO production (TNF-α and IL-6 were decreased by 46% and 42%, respectively). Pre-incubation with Rb2 (1 or 10 μmol/L) for 12 h before ALA treatment dramatically amplified the inhibitory effects of ALA (TNF-α and IL-6 were decreased by 74% and 86%, respectively). Compared to the treatment with ALA alone, pre-incubation with Rb2 resulted in a more prominent reduction in LPS-stimulated expression of iNOS and COX-2 and LPS-stimulated IKK/NF-κB phosphorylation and MAPK pathway activation. Rb2 (0.1-100 μmol/L) dose- and time-dependently increased both mRNA and protein expression of GPR120 in RAW264.7 cells, but treatment with Rb2 alone did not exert anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells.

Methods and Materials Data from 225 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were cross-sectionally analyzed. The serum levels of n-6 PUFAs [dihomo-γ- (DGLA) and arachidonic  (AA)] and n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic ) were measured, and the estimated Δ-5 desaturase (D5D) activity was calculated based on the AA to DGLA ratio. The associations between the composition of PUFAs and -related parameters, including the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, alanine amino transferase (ALT) level, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and body fat percentage, as measured by a bioelectrical impedance analysis, were analyzed. Results Among the PUFAs, the DGLA level had the strongest correlations with BMI (p<0.001), waist circumference (p<0.001), ALT level (p<0.001), HOMA-IR (p<0.001), and body fat percentage (p<0.01). AA was positively correlated and D5D was negatively correlated with several -related parameters, while n-3 PUFAs did not have a constant correlation.

The results of the present study showed that of all the fatty acids tested, linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA) were the most effective in suppressing the growth of normal gastric cells (GES1) at 180 and 200 μM, while gastric carcinoma cells (MGC and SGC) were inhibited at 200 μM. Arachidonic  (AA) suppressed the growth of GES1, MGC and SGC cells and lower concentrations (120 and 160 μM) of AA were more effective against gastric carcinoma (MGC and SGC) cells compared to normal gastric cells (GES1). Paradoxically, both eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids though are more unsaturated than AA, were less effective compared with LA, ALA and AA in suppressing the growth of both normal and cancer cells. At the concentration used, methotrexate showed much less growth suppressive action compared to all the fatty acids tested. PUFAs-treated cells showed accumulation of lipid droplets. A close association was noted between apoptosis and lipid peroxides formed compared to the ability of normal and tumor cells to generate ROS (reactive  species) and induce SOD (superoxide dismutase activity) in response to fatty acids tested and methotrexate. Both normal and tumor cells generated lipoxin A4 (LXA4) in response to supplementation of fatty acids and methotrexate though no significant correlation was noted between their ability to induce apoptosis and LXA4 formed.

Within this time span, 45 days were dedicated to examining the effects of the intake of a beverage rich in polyphenols (one serving: 200 mL per day) supplemented in their diet. The beverage was a mixture of citrus juice (95%) and Aronia melanocarpa juice (5%) (ACJ). Fifty-two oxylipins were analyzed in the urine. The quantification was carried out using solid-phase extraction, liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The physical activity decreased the excretion of some PG, IsoP, TX, and LT metabolites from arachidonic , γ-dihomo-, and eicosapentaenoic . The ACJ also reduced the excretion of 2,3-dinor-11β-PGF and 11-dehydro-TXB, although the levels of other metabolites increased after juice supplementation (PGE, 15-keto-15-F-IsoP, 20-OH-PGE, LTE, and 15-epi-15-E-IsoP), compared to the placebo. The metabolites that increased in abundance have been related to vascular homeostasis and smooth muscle function, suggesting a positive effect on the cardiovascular system.

However, the mechanism(s) by which EEN suppresses inflammation are not yet fully understood. The aims were to examine cellular mechanism(s) through which EEN may suppress inflammation and investigate potential pathways to enhance anti-inflammatory properties of EEN.Glutamine, arginine, vitamin D, and α  (ALA), present in PF, along with curcumin, were identified as immunoactive nutrient therapies. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-exposed HT-29 colonic epithelial cells were used to investigate the immunosuppressive activity of the nutrients by assessing their effect on cell viability, cell activity, chemokine response (interleukin-8 [IL-8]), nuclear factor (NF)-κB, P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, IκB kinase (Iκκ), and nitric oxide (NO).Cellular viability and activity were maintained with all nutrient treatments. Glutamine, arginine, and vitamin D, but not ALA, significantly attenuated IL-8 production. Glutamine and arginine led to phosphorylation blockade of the signaling components in NF-κB and P38 pathways, reduction in kinase activity, and enhancement in NO production. Combining glutamine, arginine, and curcumin at optimal concentrations completely abolished the IL-8 response.These data indicate that glutamine, arginine, and vitamin D can suppress inflammation at concentrations equivalent to those used in PF. The mechanisms of this action were mediated through influencing the NF-κB and P38 cascades.

Wild-type (WT) mice were fed control diet, and Apc(Min/+) mice were fed either control diet or control diet supplemented with 5% BRBs for 8 weeks. Colonic and intestinal polyp size and number were measured. A non-targeted metabolomic analysis was conducted on colonic mucosa, liver and fecal specimens. Eight weeks of BRB treatment significantly decreased intestinal and colonic polyp number and size in Apc(Min/+) mice. The apc gene mutation significantly changed 52 metabolites in colonic mucosa associated with increased amino  and decreased lipid metabolites, as well as 39 liver and 8 fecal metabolites. BRBs significantly reversed 23 apc-regulated metabolites, including 13 colonic mucosa, 8 liver and 2 fecal metabolites that were involved in amino , glutathione, lipid and nucleotide metabolism. Of these, changes in eight metabolites were linearly correlated with decreased colonic polyp number and size in BRB-treated Apc(Min/+) mice. Elevated levels of putrescine and linolenate in Apc(Min/+) mice were significantly decreased by BRBs. Ornithine decarboxylase expression, the key enzyme in putrescine generation, was fully suppressed by BRBs. These results suggest that BRBs produced beneficial effects against colonic adenoma development in Apc(Min/+) mice and modulated multiple metabolic pathways. The metabolite changes produced by BRBs might potentially reflect the BRB-mediated chemopreventive effects in colorectal cancer patients.© The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

Insight into the changes of the composition of metabolites and dysregulation of target genes and proteins enhances the understanding of the pathophysiology of CKD and its complications, and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Chronic interstitial nephropathy is a common cause of CKD. The present study was designed to determine the effect of chronic interstitial nephropathy on the composition of serum metabolites and regulation of oxidative, inflammatory, fibrotic and cytoprotective pathways.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to the CKD and control groups ( n  = 8/group). CKD was induced by administration of adenine (200 mg/kg body weight/day) by oral gavage for 3 weeks. The control group was treated with the vehicle alone. The animals were then observed for an additional 3 weeks, at which point they were sacrificed and kidney and serum samples were collected. Serum metabolomic and lipidomic analyses were performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight high-definition mass spectrometry. Kidney tissues were processed for histological and molecular biochemical analyses.CKD rats exhibited increased plasma urea and creatinine concentrations, renal interstitial fibrosis, tubular damage and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant and pro-fibrotic pathways. Comparison of serum from CKD and control rats revealed significant differences in concentrations of amino acids and lipids including 33 metabolites and 35 lipid species. This was associated with marked abnormalities of fatty  oxidation, and γ- and linoleic  metabolism in CKD rats. Logistic regression analysis identified tetracosanoic , docosatrienoic , PC(18:3/14:1) and l -aspartic , tetracosanoic  and docosatrienoic  as novel biomarkers of chronic interstitial nephropathy.Advanced CKD in rats with adenine-induced chronic interstitial nephropathy results in profound changes in the serum metabolome, activation of inflammatory, oxidative and fibrotic pathways, and suppression of cytoprotective and antioxidant pathways.© The Author 2017.

The fatty acids esterified in sn-2 are thus preferentially absorbed, which means that the bioavailability of a single fatty  is affected by its position on the triglyceride. This experiment is carried out with the milk used to make cheese applied in a study with 42 human volunteers. In that study the authors detected an improvement in the blood  profile. The aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of this kind of cheese in improving human health by studying how linseed supplementation affects the milk fatty  composition of the 3 different triglyceride positions and thus the fatty  bioavailability. The sn-2 were obtained by reacting total milk lipids with swine pancreatic lipase. The milk came from 24 sheep fed a control diet and 24 sheep fed a diet containing 200 g of extruded linseed per day. The sn-2 were separated by thin-layer chromatography. The fatty  composition of total lipids and sn-2 was obtained by a gas chromatography-flame ionization detector apparatus equipped with a high polar 100 m length capillary column. The bioavailability of the fatty acids was evaluated by a putative preferential intestinal absorption index (PPIAi), where PPIAi <0 indicated a disadvantageous nutritional condition and PPIAi >0 indicated a preferential intestinal absorption. With regard to the fatty  composition of triglycerides, the linseed group showed a significantly higher content of both  and rumenic  compared with the control. As a consequence of linseed supplementation, the  and rumenic  content esterified in the β-position increased greatly. This was highlighted by the PPIAi.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of genetically modified flaxseed (W86) rich in phenylpropanoid compounds and hydrolysable tannin in high cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis rabbit models compared to parental cultivar Linola.Twenty-Eight White New Zealand white rabbits aged 6 months were randomly divided into four groups, control group, high cholesterol group (10 g/kg), Linola flaxseed group (100 g/kg) and W86 flaxseed group (100 g/kg). The rabbits were fed a normal diet or a high cholesterol diet for 10 weeks. Levels of blood lipids, hematological values, total antioxidative status and superoxide dismutase activity in serum were determined. Moreover, body weight and feed intake were measured after sixth and tenth weeks. After each stage of the experiment atherogenic indexes (non-HDL-C/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and atherogenic index of plasma) was calculated.The intake of a dyslipidaemic diet negatively influenced lipid profile in rabbits at the 10 weeks of feeding. W86 flaxseed significantly decreased total cholesterol, LDL-C, VLDL-C and TG serum levels in cholesterolemic rabbits compared with parental Linola after 10 weeks. Atherogenic indexes decreased over time with a significant difference between the diets and they were the best for W86 flaxseed. Similarly, the experimental addition of W86 significantly decreased atherogenic predictors such as heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and the mean platelet volume-to-lymphocyte ratio. In rabbits, W86 flaxseed increased the activity of superoxide dismutase and total antioxidative status compared to Linola.Results of the presented study suggest that the addition of W86 flaxseed alleviate serum lipid changes in high cholesterolemic diet-administered rabbits. W86 flaxseed significantly reduced atherogenic indexes, as compared with the Linola and indicate that W86 flaxseed more effectively red CVD risk factors during hypercholesterolemia. Moreover, the presented result suggested that W86 flaxseed can be a part of a heart-healthy and antiatherogenic diet for the human.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30884679>Eight-week hempseed oil intervention improves the fatty  composition of erythrocyte phospholipids and the omega-3 index, but does not affect the lipid profile in children and adolescents with primary .</a></h2><p>Children affected by primary  have a high risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) during adulthood.

High-fat diets have been implicated in reduced gut microbiota richness, increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, and several changes at family, genus and species levels. Saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), polyunsaturated (PUFA) and conjugated  fatty acids share important pathways of immune system activation/inhibition with gut microbes, modulating obesogenic and proinflammatory profiles. Mechanisms that link dietary fat, gut microbiota and obesity are mediated by increased intestinal permeability, systemic endotoxemia, and the activity of the endocannabinoid system.

The long-chain n-3 PUFAs docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic  are anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in the models of central nervous system injury including traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the present study, we tested whether a higher brain DHA status in a mouse model on an adequate dietary α- (ALA) leads to reduced neuroinflammation and improved spontaneous recovery after TBI in comparison to a moderately lowered brain DHA status that can occur in humans.Mice reared on diets with differing ALA content were injured by a single cortical contusion impact. Change in the expression of inflammatory cytokines was measured, and cellular changes occurring after injury were analyzed by immunostaining for macrophage/microglia and astrocytes. Behavioral studies included rotarod and beam walk tests and contextual fear conditioning.Marginal supply (0.04 %) of ALA as the sole dietary source of n-3 PUFA from early gestation produced reduction of brain DHA by 35 % in adult offspring mice in comparison to the mice on adequate ALA diet (3.1 %). The DHA-depleted group showed significantly increased TBI-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the brain as well as slower functional recovery from motor deficits compared to the adequate ALA group. Despite the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, adequate ALA diet did not significantly alter either microglia/macrophage density around the contusion site or the relative M1/M2 phenotype. However, the glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity was reduced in the injured cerebral cortex of the mice on adequate ALA diet, indicating that astrocyte activation may have contributed to the observed differences in cellular and behavioral responses to TBI.Increasing the brain DHA level even from a moderately DHA-depleted state can reduce neuroinflammation and improve functional recovery after TBI, suggesting possible improvement of functional outcome by increasing dietary n-3 PUFA in human TBI.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25727966>Dietary unsaturated fatty acids differently affect catecholamine handling by adrenal chromaffin cells.</a></h2><p>Catecholamines (CA) play an important role in cardiovascular (CDV) disease risk. Namely, noradrenaline (NA) levels positively correlate whereas adrenaline (AD) levels negatively correlate with  and/or CDV disease. Western diets, which are tipically rich in Ω-6 fatty acids (FAs) and deficient in Ω-3 FAs, may contribute to the development of , type 2 diabetes and/or coronary artery disease. Taking this into consideration and the fact that our group has already described that saturated FAs affect catecholamine handling by adrenal chromaffin cells, this work aimed to investigate the effect of unsaturated FAs upon catecholamine handling in the same model. Our results showed that chronic exposure to unsaturated FAs differently modulated CA cellular content and release, regardless of both FA series and number of carbon atoms. Namely, the Ω-6 arachidonic and linoleic acids, based on their effect on CA release and cellular content, seemed to impair NA and AD vesicular transport, whereas γ- selectively impaired AD synthesis and release. Within the Ω-9 FAs, oleic  was devoid of effect, and elaidic  behaved similarly to γ-. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (Ω-3 series) impaired the synthesis and release of both NA and AD.

Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive  species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

The objective of this study was to identify changes in the pig liver transcriptome induced by a diet enriched with omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids and to characterize the biological mechanisms related to PUFA metabolism. Polish Landrace pigs (n = 12) were fed diet enriched with linoleic  (LA, omega-6) and α- (ALA, omega-3) or standard diet as a control. The fatty  profiling was assayed in order to verify how feeding influenced the fatty  content in the liver, and subsequently next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) between transcriptomes between dietary groups. The biological mechanisms and pathway interaction networks were identified using DAVID and Cytoscape tools. Fatty  profile analysis indicated a higher contribution of PUFAs in the liver for LA- and ALA-enriched diet group, particularly for the omega-3 fatty  family, but not omega-6. Next-generation sequencing identified 3565 DEG, 1484 of which were induced and 2081 were suppressed by PUFA supplementation. A low ratio of omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids resulted in the modulation of fatty  metabolism pathways and over-representation of genes involved in  metabolism, signal transduction, and immune response pathways.

However, whether these metabolic effects of PUFA on intestine are mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) remains to be elucidated. To determine the effects of α- (ALA) on intestinal fatty  (FA) metabolism and whether these effects were affected by AMPK deletion, mice deficient in the catalytic subunit of AMPKα1 or AMPKα2 and wild-type (WT) mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HF) or HF supplemented with ALA (HF-A).

ALA also increased mRNA expression of genes (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, acyl-CoA oxidase 1, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, cytochrome P450 4A10 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4a) involved in intestinal lipid oxidation and mRNA expression of TAG synthesis-related genes (monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferases 1 and 2) in WT mice. Consistent with these, expression levels of phosphorylated AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 were also increased in WT mice after ALA addition. However, in the absence of either AMPKα1 or AMPKα2, ALA supplementation failed to increase intestinal lipid oxidation. In addition, no significant effects of either diet (HF and HF-A) or genotype (WT, AMPKα1(-/-) and AMPKα2(-/-)) on FA uptake in the intestine and faecal TAG output were observed.

However, many of these compounds with in vitro activity fail to respond in vivo, probably due to the sophistication of the physiological energy regulatory networks. In this context, C. elegans has emerged as a plausible model for the identification and characterization of the effect of such compounds on fat storage in a complete organism. However, the results obtained in such a simple model are not easily extrapolated to more complex organisms such as mammals, which hinders its application in the short term. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain new experimental data about the evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms of fat loss between worms and mammals. Previously, we found that some omega-6 fatty acids promote fat loss in C. elegans by up-regulation of peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation in an omega-3 independent manner. In this work, we prove that the omega-6 fatty acids' effects on worms are also seen when they are supplemented with a natural omega-6 source (borage seed oil, BSO). Additionally, we explore the anti- effects of two doses of BSO in a diet-induced  rat model, validating the up-regulation of peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation. The supplementation with BSO significantly reduces body weight gain and energy efficiency and prevents white adipose tissue accumulation without affecting food intake. Moreover, BSO also increases serum HDL-cholesterol levels, improves insulin resistance and promotes the down-regulation of Cebpa, an adipogenesis-related gene. Therefore, we conclude that the effects of omega-6 fatty acids are highly conserved between worms and -induced mammals, so these compounds could be considered to treat or prevent -related disorders.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism', 'insulin resistance', 'lipogenesis', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890432>Lipid droplets participate in modulating innate immune genes in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney cells.</a></h2><p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are increasingly being recognized as important immune modulators in mammals, in additional to their function of lipid ester deposition. However, the role of LDs in fish  remains poorly understood. In this study, the function of LDs in the innate immune response of Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells, which are the equivalent of myeloid cells in vertebrates, was investigated. LD number and TG content significantly increased in the CIK cells following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), and polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic  (Poly [I: C]) for 24 h, accompanied by increases in the relative expression of several innate immune genes. However, fatty  compositions of the triglycerides were not changed after treatment with these three pathogenic mimics. LPS, PGN, and Poly (I: C) did not alter the relative expressions of lipogenic (FAS, SCD, and DGAT) and lipid catabolic (PPARα, ATGL, and CPT-1) genes. However, these treatments did increase the mRNA levels of lipid transportation genes (FATP/CD36, ACSL1, and ACSL4), and also decreased the non-esterified fatty  level in the medium. To further explore the role of LDs in the immune response, CIK cells were incubated with different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 μM) of exogenous lipid mix (LM; oleic  [OA]:linoleic  [LA]: [LNA] = 2:1:1), and were then transferred to a lipid-free medium and incubated for 24 h. LD size and number increased with the increase in lipid levels, and this was accompanied by increased expression of innate immune genes, including MyD88, IRF3, and IL-1β, which were expressed at their highest levels in 300 μM exogenous lipid mix. Interestingly, after incubating with different fatty acids (LM, OA, LA, LNA, arachidonic  [ARA], and docosahexaenoic  [DHA]; 300 μM), ARA and DHA were more potent in inducing LD formation and innate immune gene expression in the CIK cells. Finally, atglistatin, an ATGL inhibitor, effectively attenuated the expression of most genes upregulated by ARA or DHA, suggesting that lipolysis may be involved in the regulation of immune genes at the transcriptional level. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate that LDs are functional organelles that could act as modulators in the innate immune response of CIK cells. Additionally, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  enriched LDs play a unique role in regulating this process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects on eosinophils were tested by transwell migration and surface expression of CD11b.In vitro experiments showed adhesion of eosinophils to Phleum pratense pollen. In chemotaxis assays eosinophils displayed significant directed migration to APEs.

Moreover, total lipid extracts from pollen and RP-HPLC fractions containing monohydroxylated derivatives of linoleic and  induced similar migratory responses, although to a lesser degree than APEs. In addition, APEs and lipid extracts induced up-regulation of CD11b surface expression and secretion of eosinophil cationic protein.

Thus, a study of the interactions of lymph nodes and PAT could help to elucidate the mechanisms behind IBD pathogenesis.The purpose of this study was to examine lymph nodes and PAT alterations during reactivated TNBS- in Wistar rats.In this study, the alterations of PAT and lymph node cells during experimental , induced by repeated intracolonic TNBS instillations, were evaluated, focusing on fatty  and adipocytokine profile analysis and cytokines production, respectively.Fatty  analysis of PAT reveals an increase of ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids during colits, such as linoleic , gamma- and arachidonic . ω-6 arachidonic  was not increased in lymph node cells or serum. PAT also produces elevated levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines during . Lymph node cells release high levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α but not IL-10, characterizing the predominant Th-1 response associated with this disease.

There has been increasing interest in the relationship of fish oil with skin protection and homeostasis, especially with respect to the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). The other PUFAs, such as α- (ALA) and linoleic  (LA), also show a beneficial effect on the skin. The major mechanisms of PUFAs for attenuating cutaneous  are the competition with the inflammatory arachidonic  and the inhibition of proinflammatory eicosanoid production. On the other hand, PUFAs in fish oil can be the regulators that affect the synthesis and activity of cytokines for promoting wound healing. A systemic review was conducted to demonstrate the association between fish oil supplementation and the benefits to the skin. The following describes the different cosmetic and therapeutic approaches using fatty acids derived from fish oil, especially ALA, LA, DHA, and EPA. This review summarizes the cutaneous application of fish oil and the related fatty acids in the cell-based, animal-based, and clinical models. The research data relating to fish oil treatment of skin disorders suggest a way forward for generating advances in cosmetic and dermatological uses.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28063950>Dietary /linoleic  ratios modulate immune response, physical barrier and related signaling molecules mRNA expression in the gills of juvenile grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella).</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to explore the possible effects of dietary ALA/LNA ratios on the gill immunity,  and antioxidant capacity, and the related signaling factor mRNA levels of juvenile grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). Fish were fed diets with different ALA/LNA ratios (0.01, 0.34, 0.68, 1.03, 1.41, 1.76 and 2.15) for 60 days. The present results showed that ALA/LNA ratio of 1.03 significantly enhanced lysozyme and  phosphatase activities, complement 3 contents, promoted mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (Hepcidin and liver expression antimicrobial peptide-2), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor β1) and inhibitor protein κBα, whereas suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1β, interleukin 8, tumor necrosis factor a and interferon γ2), and signal molecules (IκB kinase β, IκB kines γ and nuclear factor κB p65) mRNA levels in the gill, indicating that optimal dietary ALA/LNA ratio improve gill immunity of juvenile fish. Besides, ALA/LNA ratio of 1.03 increased mRNA levels of the barrier functional proteins (occludin, zonula occludens-1, claudin-b, -c and -3), and reduced the pore-formation proteins (claudin-15a) and myosin light-chain kinase mRNA abundance in the gill of juvenile grass carp, indicating optimum ALA/LNA ratio strengthen gill  of juvenile fish. Additionally, ALA/LNA ratio of 1.03 increased glutathione contents, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase activities and mRNA abundance, and nuclear factor erythoid 2-related factor 2 mRNA levels in the gill of fish, suggesting that optimal ALA/LNA ratio ameliorate gill antioxidant status of juvenile fish. Interestingly, dietary ALA/LNA ratios had no effect on IκB kinase α and catalase activities in fish gills. Collectively, optimal dietary ALA/LNA ratio could improve gill immunity and strengthen physical barrier of juvenile fish. Based on the quadratic regression analysis of complement 3 content in the gill, optimal dietary ALA/LNA ratio for maximum growth of juvenile grass carp was estimated to be 1.12.Copyright © 2017.

While a high proportion of dietary intake of ω-6 PUFAs is associated with various inflammatory disorders, higher intake of ω-3 PUFAs is known to offer protection. It is now well established that beneficial effects of ω-3 PUFAs are mediated in part by their oxygenated metabolites mainly via the lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways. However, the down-stream signaling pathways that are involved in these anti-inflammatory effects of ω-3 PUFAs have not been elucidated. The present study evaluates the effects of 15-LOX metabolites of α- (ALA, ω-3 PUFA) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced  in RAW 264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages. Further, the effect of these metabolites on the survival of BALB/c mice in LPS mediated septic shock and also polymicrobial sepsis in Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP) mouse model was studied.

Despite the identification of enzymes for unusual oxidized fatty  synthesis, the production of these fatty acids in engineered seeds remains low and is often hampered by their inefficient exclusion from phospholipids. Recent studies have established the feasibility of increasing triacylglycerol content in plant leaves, which provides a novel approach for increasing  density of biomass crops. Here, we determined whether the fatty  composition of leaf oil could be engineered to accumulate unusual fatty acids. Eleostearic  (ESA) is a conjugated fatty  produced in seeds of the tung tree (Vernicia fordii) and has both industrial and nutritional end-uses. Arabidopsis thaliana lines with elevated leaf oil were first generated by transforming wild-type, cgi-58 or pxa1 mutants (the latter two of which contain mutations disrupting fatty  breakdown) with the diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1 or DGAT2) and/or oleosin genes from tung. High-leaf-oil plant lines were then transformed with tung FADX, which encodes the fatty  desaturase/conjugase responsible for ESA synthesis. Analysis of lipids in leaves revealed that ESA was efficiently excluded from phospholipids, and co-expression of tung FADX and DGAT2 promoted a synergistic increase in leaf oil content and ESA accumulation. Taken together, these results provide a new approach for increasing leaf oil content that is coupled with accumulation of unusual fatty acids. Implications for production of biofuels, bioproducts, and plant-pest interactions are discussed.© 2017 The Authors.

Infection of the Fusarium graminearum disruption mutant Δfgl1, which lacks the effector lipase FGL1, is restricted to inoculated wheat (Triticum aestivum) spikelets, whereas the wild-type strain colonized the whole wheat spike. Our studies here were aimed at analyzing the role of FGL1 in establishing full F. graminearum virulence. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy revealed that the Δfgl1 mutant strongly induced the deposition of spot-like callose patches in vascular bundles of directly inoculated spikelets, while these callose deposits were not observed in infections by the wild type. Elevated concentrations of the polyunsaturated free fatty acids (FFAs) linoleic and α-, which we detected in F. graminearum wild type-infected wheat spike tissue compared with Δfgl1-infected tissue, provided clear evidence for a suggested function of FGL1 in suppressing callose biosynthesis. These FFAs not only inhibited plant callose biosynthesis in vitro and in planta but also partially restored virulence to the Δfgl1 mutant when applied during infection of wheat spikelets. Additional FFA analysis confirmed that the purified effector lipase FGL1 was sufficient to release linoleic and α- acids from wheat spike tissue.

Plasma levels of soluble receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR)-1, also known as sFlt1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1), an antiangiogenic factor have been reported to be elevated in preeclampsia. It was reported that pregnant mice deficient in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity show a preeclampsia-like phenotype due to a deficiency or absence of 2-methoxyoestradiol (2-ME), a natural metabolite of estradiol that is elevated during the third trimester of normal human pregnancy. Additionally, autoantibodies (AT1-AAs) that bind and activate the angiotensin II receptor type 1 a (AT1 receptor) also have a role in preeclampsia. None of these abnormalities are consistently seen in all the patients with preeclampsia and some of them are not specific to pregnancy. Preeclampsia could occur due to an imbalance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors. VEGF, an angiogenic factor, is necessary for the transport of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to endothelial cells. Hence reduced VEGF levels decrease the availability of PUFAs to endothelial cells. This leads to a decrease in the formation of anti-inflammatory and angiogenic factors: lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins from PUFAs. Lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins, and PUFAs suppress ; activation of leukocytes, platelets, and macrophages; production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α; and oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction; and enhance production of prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO). Estrogen enhances the formation of lipoxin A4 and NO. PUFAs also augment the production of NO and inhibit the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and antagonize the actions of angiotensin II. Thus, PUFAs can prevent activation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 a (AT1 receptor). Patients with preeclampsia have decreased plasma phospholipid concentrations of arachidonic  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), the precursors of lipoxins (from AA), resolvins (from EPA and DHA), and protectins (from DHA) and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1 from DGLA: dihomo-γ-) and prostacyclin (PGI2 derived from AA). Based on these evidences, it is proposed that preeclampsia may occur due to deficiency of PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory products: lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Participants were genotyped for the functional TNFA -308 G/A polymorphism. The genotype or allele frequency of the TNFA -308 G/A polymorphism did not differ between the BMI groups. However, when dietary fat intake was 30% of total energy intake [percentage energy (%E)], the odds of being obese with the TNFA GA+AA genotype was only 12% of that with GG, but increasing intake of dietary fat (%E) was associated with a significantly faster rate of increase in obesity risk in women with the TNFA GA+AA genotype compared with those with the GG genotype (P = 0.036). There were significant diet-gene interactions between  (%E) and the total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio (P = 0.036), and PUFA (%E) and LDL cholesterol levels (P = 0.026), with participants with the A allele being more responsive to changes in relative fat intake. The TNFA -308 G/A polymorphism modified the relationship between dietary fat intake, obesity risk, and serum lipid concentrations in black SA women.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23818385>Lipidomics of essential fatty acids and oxygenated metabolites.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids in mammals may be oxygenated into a myriad of bioactive products through di- and monooxygenases, products that are rapidly degraded to control their action. To evaluate the phenotypes of biological systems regarding this wide family of compounds, a lipidomics approach in function of time and compartments would be relevant. The current review takes into consideration most of the diverse oxygenated metabolites of essential fatty acids at large and their immediate degradation products. Their biological function and life span are considered. Overall, this is a fluxolipidomics approach that is emerging.© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The yield and quality of sesame are severely affected by high salinity in coastal and semi-arid/arid regions. In this study, the phenotypic, physiological, and proteomic changes induced by salt treatment were analyzed in salt-tolerant (G441) and salt-sensitive (G358) seedlings. Phenotypic and physiological results indicated that G441 had an enhanced capacity to withstand salinity stress compared to G358. Proteomic analysis revealed a strong induction of salt-responsive protein species in sesame, mainly related to catalytic, hydrolase, oxidoreductase, and binding activities. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that more salt-responsive proteins in G441 were involved in tyrosine metabolism, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, carbon metabolism,  metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, photosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism. Furthermore, G441 displayed unique differentially accumulated proteins in seedlings functioning as heat shock proteins, abscisic  receptor PYL2-like, calcium-dependent protein kinases, serine/threonine-protein phosphatases, nucleoredoxin, and antioxidant enzymes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that some of the proteins were also regulated by salinity stress at the transcript level. Our findings provide important information on salinity responses in plants and may constitute useful resources for enhancing salinity tolerance in sesame. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study identified potential biological pathways and salt-responsive protein species related to transducing stress signals and scavenging reactive  species under salt stress. These findings will provide possible participants/pathways/proteins that contribute to salt tolerance and may serve as the basis for improving salinity tolerance in sesame and other plants.Copyright © 2019.

Drought tolerance is a complex trait and involves interplay of a vast array of genes. Several genotypes of rice have evolved features that impart tolerance to drought and other abiotic stresses. Comparative analysis of drought stress-responsive transcriptome between drought-tolerant (DT) landraces/genotypes and drought-sensitive modern rice cultivars will unravel novel genetic regulatory mechanisms involved in stress tolerance. Here, we report transcriptome analysis in a highly DT rice landrace, Nagina 22 (N22), versus a high-yielding but drought-susceptible rice variety IR64. Both genotypes exhibited a diverse global transcriptional response under normal and drought conditions. Gene ontology (GO) analysis suggested that drought tolerance of N22 was attributable to the enhanced expression of several enzyme-encoding genes. Drought susceptibility of IR64 was attributable to significant down-regulation of regulatory components that confer drought tolerance. Pathway analysis unravelled significant up-regulation of several components of carbon fixation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and flavonoid biosynthesis and down-regulation of starch and sucrose metabolism in both the cultivars under drought. However, significant up-regulation of α- metabolic pathway observed in N22 under drought appears to be in good agreement with high drought tolerance of this genotype. Consensus cis-motif profiling of drought-induced co-expressed genes led to the identification of novel cis-motifs. Taken together, the results of the comparative transcriptome analysis led to the identification of specific genotype-dependent genes responsible for drought tolerance in the rice landrace N22.© 2010 The Authors.

ROS and RNS can directly damage biomacromolecules such as proteins, DNA, and lipids. Lipid peroxidation, however, can result in reactive carbonyl species (RCS) that can also modify proteins and DNA. In contrast to an extensive literature on the modification of proteins and DNA from omega-6 fatty acids, there are few studies on RCS generation from other fatty acids, particularly omega-3 fatty acids, which are frequently consumed from the diet and diet supplements. Therefore, a comparison between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids has been conducted. LC-MS/MS analysis of carbonyl-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) standards yielded characteristic fragment ions. Autoxidation products of α- and linoleic  were then derivatized with DNPH and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The results showed that α-, an omega-3 fatty , generated more acrolein and crotonaldehyde than did linoleic , an omega-6 fatty . Omega-3 fatty acids might be easily degraded to smaller monoaldehydes or dicarbonyls. Omega-3 fatty acids have been considered as health improvement components for a long time. However, on the basis of the results presented here, use of omega-3 fatty acids should be re-evaluated in vivo for safety purposes.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28558700>Punicic : A striking health substance to combat  syndromes in humans.</a></h2><p>Punicic , a bioactive compound of pomegranate seed oil has gained wide attention for their therapeutic potential.

Main causes of NAFLD comprise high caloric intake and a sedentary lifestyle, with high intakes of saturated FAs.The review includes several searches considering the effects of n-3 LCPUFAs in NAFLD in vivo and in vitro models, using the PubMed database from the National Library of Medicine-National Institutes of Health.The LCPUFAs eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5 n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6 n-3, DHA) have a positive effect in diminishing liver steatosis, OS, and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and pro-inflammatory cytokines, with improvement of insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels. The molecular pathways described for n-3 LCPUFAs in cellular and animal models and humans include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α activation favouring FA oxidation, diminution of  due to sterol responsive element binding protein-1c downregulation and inflammation resolution. Besides, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 activation is elicited by n-3 LCPUFA-derived oxidation products producing direct and indirect antioxidant responses, with concomitant anti-fibrogenic action.The discussed effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation support its use in NAFLD, although having a limited value in NASH, a contention that may involve n-3 LCPUFA oxygenated derivatives. Clinical trials establishing optimal dosages, intervention times, type of patients and possible synergies with other natural products are needed in future studies.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><p>Keyword:['NASH', 'inflammation', 'insulin resistance', 'lipogenesis']</p></html>
