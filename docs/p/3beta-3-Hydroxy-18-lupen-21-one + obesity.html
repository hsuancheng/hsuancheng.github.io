The population of hypertensive patients includes some phenotypes whose blood pressure levels are particularly difficult to control, thus putting them at greater cardiovascular risk. This is especially true of so-called resistant hypertension (RH) and refractory hypertension (RfH). Recent findings suggest that the former may be due to an alteration in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, while the latter seems to be more closely related to sympathetic hyper-activation. Both these pathophysiological mechanisms are also activated in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). It is not surprising, therefore, that the prevalence of OSA in RH and RfH patients is very high (as reflected in several studies) and that treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) manages to reduce blood pressure levels in a clinically significant way in both these groups of hypertensive patients. It is therefore necessary to incorporate into the multidimensional treatment of patients with RH and RfH (changes in lifestyle, control of  and drug treatment) a study of the possible existence of OSA, as this is a potentially treatable disease. There are many questions that remain to be answered, especially regarding the ideal combination of treatment in patients with RH/RfH and OSA (drugs, renal denervation, CPAP treatment) and patients' varying response to CPAP treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692120>Outcomes of obese patients undergoing less invasive LVAD implantation.</a></h2><p> and heart failure rates continue to rise, confronting heart failure centers with challenging left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantations. Although less invasive approaches to implantation have been successfully implemented by many centers, this surgical approach has not yet been well evaluated in the obese population. Therefore, we sought to describe our experience with less invasive device implantation in this patient cohort.All implants of centrifugal ventricular assist devices were retrospectively reviewed. Patients implanted with a less invasive approach via a left thoracotomy and upper hemisternotomy were included. Patients were stratified by body mass index (<30 vs ≥30 kg/m ). Perioperative and short-term outcomes were evaluated.Forty-two patients implanted with the less invasive approach (BMI <30: 27 vs. BMI ≥30 kg/m : 15) were identified. The obese cohort was significantly younger (58.5 vs 46.1 years, P = .022), while other preoperative demographics were similar. Postoperative mechanical ventilator time was longer in the obese cohort (22.9 vs 46.1 hour, P = .045). However, other perioperative and short-term outcomes were comparable. Wound dehiscence occurred in one obese patient. Six-month survival was also comparable between cohorts (96.3% vs 86.7%, P = .264).In this limited patient series, outcomes appear to be comparable in nonobese and obese patients undergoing less invasive LVAD implantation. Therefore,  should perhaps not be viewed as a lone contraindication to the application of this surgical approach.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694237>Effects of Endurance and Endurance-Strength Training on Endothelial Function in Women with : A Randomized Trial.</a></h2><p>Some investigations have demonstrated that a combined endurance-strength training is the most effective in the treatment of .

In a randomized trial, 39 obese women aged 28-62 completed endurance (n = 22, 60-80% HR) or combined training (n = 17, 20 minutes of strength exercises, 50-60% 1RM and 25 minutes of endurance training, 60-80% HR). Before and after the intervention vascular endothelial function (endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), blood total antioxidant capacity (TAC)), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides and C-reactive protein (CRP)as well as visceral adiposity index (VAI), total-body skeletal muscle mass and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) were determined. After the trainings, in both groups total cholesterol and total-body skeletal muscle mass increased ( < 0.05). In the group undergoing combined training, lower ( < 0.05) VAI, AIP, CRP and LDL-C were noted. In the group undergoing endurance training TBARS concentration decreased ( < 0.01), while the HDL-C ( < 0.01) concentration as well as eNOS ( < 0.05) activity increased. No significant differences between groups were found, either before or after the programs. Both training programs led to the improvement of lipid metabolism, but only endurance training alone favorably changed indicators of endothelial functions in women with .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695465>How Western Diet And Lifestyle Drive The Pandemic Of  And Civilization Diseases.</a></h2><p>Westernized populations are plagued by a plethora of chronic non-infectious degenerative diseases, termed as "civilization diseases", like , diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease and many more, diseases which are rare or virtually absent in hunter-gatherers and other non-westernized populations. There is a growing awareness that the cause of this amazing discrepancy lies in the profound changes in diet and lifestyle during recent human history. This paper shows that the transition from Paleolithic nutrition to Western diets, along with lack of corresponding genetic adaptations, cause significant distortions of the fine-tuned metabolism that has evolved over millions of years of human evolution in adaptation to Paleolithic diets. With the increasing spread of Western diet and lifestyle worldwide, overweight and civilization diseases are also rapidly increasing in developing countries. It is suggested that the diet-related key changes in the developmental process include an increased production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, development of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation and an abnormal activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, all of which play pivotal roles in the development of diseases of civilization. In addition, diet-related epigenetic changes and fetal programming play an important role. The suggested pathomechanism is also able to explain the well-known but not completely understood close relationship between  and the wide range of comorbidities, like type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, etc., as diseases of the same etiopathology. Changing our lifestyle in accordance with our genetic makeup, including diet and physical activity, may help prevent or limit the development of these diseases.© 2019 Kopp.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691763>Prevalence of arterial hypertension in Brazilian adults and its associated factors and activity limitations: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Hypertension is a serious global public health problem that affects a large part of the Brazilian adult population and can cause limitations and losses of quality of life.The objective of this study was to analyze the association of hypertension and its correlated limitations, with sociodemographic and epidemiological factors.Cross-sectional study analyzing information on 44,271 adults (30 years or older) from the Brazilian National Health Survey of 2013.The prevalence of hypertension and the degree of limitation of the patients' activities associated with hypertension, according to sociodemographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements and lifestyles, were calculated for both sexes. To analyze the strength of association, bivariate and multivariate Poisson regression were used.Hypertension was the most prevalent risk factor among Brazilian adults aged 30 years or older (40.7%). It was strongly associated with the aging process (prevalence ratio, PR 3.51),  (PR 1.73), heart disease (PR 1.67) and stroke (PR 1.86). Furthermore, limitations associated with hypertension were more prevalent among those with comorbidities from noncommunicable diseases relating to hypertension complications (stroke PR 1.47; heart disease PR 1.69) and with incomplete elementary education (PR 1.19).This study showed sociodemographic inequality in the prevalence of hypertension, especially in the population with some degree of limitation associated with hypertension. It showed that improvements in access to primary care services for controlling hypertension at its initial stages are essential in order to avoid comorbidities of greater severity and limitations and losses of quality of life, especially among socially disadvantaged people.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692530>Pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: current perspectives on diagnosis and management.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the most common cause of chronic liver disease in childhood. To date, the "multiple-hit" hypothesis is largely recognized as an explanation of NAFLD pathogenesis and progression.  and features of the metabolic syndrome have been closely linked to NAFLD development. Due to the increased prevalence of  worldwide, NAFLD has reached epidemic proportions over time. Given its unfavorable cardiometabolic burden (such as cardiovascular and metabolic consequences), it represents a worrying phenomenon needing a more comprehensive and successful management. Laboratory tests and classical imaging techniques play a pivotal role in NAFLD diagnosis, but novel noninvasive alternative methods to diagnose and monitor NAFLD have been investigated. Currently, lifestyle modifications remain the mainstay treatment, although its efficacy is poor because of the lack of compliance. Pediatric research is focusing on multiple alternative treatments targeting the main pathogenic factors such as insulin-resistance, dyslipidemia, gut-liver axis and microbiota, oxidative stress, and proinflammatory pathways. Results from these studies are promising but larger validation is needed. Innovative therapeutic approaches might add an important piece in the complex knowledge of pediatric NAFLD. We aimed to summarize recent insights into NAFLD diagnosis and treatment in children, with a focus on possible future perspectives in pediatric research.© 2019 Di Sessa et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697845>Noninvasive prenatal screening for patients with high body mass index: Evaluating the impact of a customized whole genome sequencing workflow on sensitivity and residual risk.</a></h2><p>Women with high body mass index (BMI) tend to have reduced fetal fraction (FF) during cell-free DNA-based noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS), causing test failure rates up to 24.3% and prompting guidelines that recommend aneuploidy screening other than NIPS for patients with significant . Because alternatives to NIPS are only preferable if they perform better, we compared the respective sensitivities at different BMI levels of traditional aneuploidy screening and a customized whole-genome sequencing NIPS.The relationship between FF, aneuploidy, and BMI was quantified from 58,105 patients screened with a customized NIPS that does not fail samples because of low FF alone. Expected analytical sensitivity as a function of aneuploidy and BMI (e.g., trisomy 18 sensitivity when BMI=35) was determined by scaling the BMI- and aneuploidy-specific FF distribution by the FF- and aneuploidy-specific sensitivity calculated from empirically informed simulations.Across all classes of  and assuming zero FF-related test failures, analytical sensitivity for the investigated NIPS exceeded that of traditional aneuploidy screening for trisomies 13, 18, and 21.Relative to traditional aneuploidy screening, a customized NIPS with high accuracy at low FF and a low test-failure rate is a superior screening option for women with high BMI.This article is protected by copyright.

An emerging literature has suggested that attachment orientation may influence a range of outcomes associated with bariatric surgery. The purpose of this systematic scoping review was to map the literature and examine the role of attachment orientation in the context of bariatric surgery. Studies conducted with patients who are undergoing or have undergone bariatric surgery, with a measure of attachment orientation and published by 21st July 2019, were located through electronic searches including Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science. 21180 studies were identified, of which 18 were retained for narrative synthesis. The major outcome themes reported were (1) post-surgery weight-loss/body mass index (k = 10), (2) eating behaviour (k = 9), (3) attachment orientation differences in bariatric surgery patients compared with control groups (k = 4) and 4) other mental and physical health outcomes (k = 12). Overall, the results showed that there was little evidence to suggest that poor attachment orientation is predictor of weight-loss following surgery. There was evidence to suggest that poorer attachment orientation relates to poorer eating behaviours both before and after surgery, that patients undergoing bariatric surgery are more likely to have a poorer attachment orientation and attachment orientation is related to mental health outcomes but not physical health outcomes for patients. However, where relationships were identified, there were considerable inconsistencies regarding the dimension of attachment orientation that drove the relationship. Future studies should consider appropriate sample sizes for studies, replication of key findings and longer durations for longitudinal studies.Copyright © 2019.

However, it remains unknown whether Nrf2 is the link between oxidative stress and the induction of lipid accumulation in adipocytes.Here, we show that oxidative stress is markedly increased in white adipose tissue from mice with high-fat diet-induced or genetically (ob/ob)-induced  and from human subjects with . Notably, in response to oxidative stress, Nrf2 expression and activity were induced, further promoting lipid accumulation in adipocytes and exacerbating the development of . In contrast, Nrf2 ablation alleviated oxidative stress-induced lipid accumulation. Mechanistically, oxidative stress promoted Nrf2 recruitment to the SREBP-1 promoter, inducing target gene transcription and subsequent lipogenesis. Additionally, Nrf2 mediated oxidative stress-inhibited lipolysis in adipocytes via the PKA pathway. Innovation and Conclusion: Our data provide a novel insight that Nrf2, as a critical signaling node, links oxidative stress to the induction of fat accumulation in adipocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692928>Substituent Effects on the Reactivity of the 2,4,6-Tridehydropyridinium Cation, an Aromatic σ,σ,σ-Triradical.</a></h2><p>2,4,6-Tridehydropyridinium cation () undergoes three consecutive atom or atom group abstractions from reagent molecules in the gas phase. By placing a π-electron-donating hydroxyl group between two radical sites, their reactivity can be quenched by enhancing their through-space coupling via a favorable resonance structure. Indeed, 3-hydroxy-2,4,6-tridehydropyridinium cation () abstracts only one atom or group of atoms from reagents. On the other hand, an electron-withdrawing cyano group between two of the radical sites () destabilizes the analogous resonance structure and diminishes through-space coupling between the radical sites, resulting in abstraction of three atoms, just like . However, the cyano-substituent also increases acidity to the point that  reacts pre-dominantly via proton transfer instead of undergoing radical reactions. Therefore, acidic triradicals may undergo nonradical, barrierless proton transfer reactions faster than radical reactions, which are usually accompanied by barriers. Examination of the analogous cyano-substituted mono-and biradicals revealed behavior similar to that of the corresponding unsubstituted species, with the exception of substantially greater reactivities due to their greater (calculated) vertical electron affinities. Finally, the 3-cyano-2,6-didehydropyridinium cation with a singlet ground state (S-T splitting: -11.9 kcal mol) was found to react exclusively from the lowest-energy triplet state by fast proton transfer reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692257>Myokine levels after resistance exercise in young adults with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).</a></h2><p>Individuals with PWS require marked caloric restriction and daily exercise to prevent morbid . Lower energy expenditure, hypotonia, decreased muscle mass, and cognitive impairment make exercise challenging for this population. Exercise guidelines include resistance training as an important component. Myokine responses to resistance exercise may mediate beneficial metabolic effects. We aimed to determine if young PWS adults can perform a resistance exercise program and to measure myokine responses in PWS versus age- and BMI-matched controls. Each group included 11 participants (7M/4F). Ages and BMI for PWS and controls were 30.7 ± 4.6 versus 30.1 ± 4.3 years and 28.3 ± 4.3 versus 28.2 ± 4.2 kg/m , respectively. Glucose, creatine kinase (CK), lactate, and myokines were measured before, after, 30, and 60 min after completing eight resistance exercises. Myokines were assayed using a multiplex myokine panel (Merck Millipore). CK was lower in PWS versus controls (62 ± 16 vs.322 ± 100 U/L, p < .04). Peak lactate was 3.7 ± 0.7 in PWS versus 7.3 ± 0.7 mmol/Lin controls (p < .001). The increase in interleukin-6 was similar in PWS and controls (41 ± 16% and 35 ± 10%, respectively). Pre- and post-exercise levels of the six myokines assayed showed no consistent differences between the PWS and control participants. PWS young adults are capable of performing resistance/strength-building exercise. The lower CK and peak lactate levels in PWS may reflect decreased muscle mass in this population. Further studies are needed to determine optimal exercise regimens and assess the role of myokines incontributing to the metabolic phenotype of PWS.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692525>Relationship between thyroid dysfunction and body weight: a not so evident paradigm.</a></h2><p>Hypothyroidism has traditionally been associated with , whereas hyperthyroidism has been linked to being underweight. However, very few studies have assessed these associations. The aim of this work is to evaluate the association between thyroid dysfunction and body mass index (BMI) at baseline and after normalization of the hormone levels.A retrospective, observational study of a cohort of otherwise healthy patients that were referred for evaluation of thyroid dysfunction to the Endocrine Department of Pontevedra University Complex Hospital, Spain was conducted. We collected data of BMI and thyroid hormone levels before treatment and after normalization of thyroid function within a follow-up period of 12 months.A total of 330 patients were initially selected for the study. In order to exclude variables that for any reason could influence on BMI, 235 were excluded for further studies. Another 61 patients were also excluded because incomplete data on their medical records, failure to achieve euthyroidism, or lost to follow-up. Therefore, the eligible final study group consisted of 34 patients (17 with hypothyroidism and 17 with hyperthyroidism). No differences were observed in mean baseline BMI between hypo and hyperthyroid patients (27.07±3.22 vs 26.39±4.44, =0.609). Overweight or  was observed in 76.5% and 58.8% of hypothyroid and hyperthyroid patients, respectively (=0.23). After normalization of thyroid function, the weight of hypothyroid patients decreased from 70.93±10.06 kg to 68.68±10.14 (=0.000), while the weight of hyperthyroid patients increased from 65.45±11.64 kg to 68.37±12.80 (=0.000). Their mean BMI was 26.22±3.36 and 27.57±4.98 (=0.361) for hypo- and hyperthyroid patients, respectively. 58.8% and 64.7% patients remained in the overweight/ range in each group (=0.72).Untreated thyroid dysfunction is not associated with BMI.

Pathogenic variants in the paternal copy of MAGEL2 cause Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SHFYNG), a neurodevelopmental disorder related to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Patients with SHFYNG, like PWS, manifest neonatal hypotonia, feeding difficulties, hypogonadism, intellectual disability and sleep apnea.

We aimed to construct a measure of mental health competence (MHC), a skills-based assessment of positive mental health, using existing survey items in a representative sample of UK children, and to investigate its overlap with mental health difficulties (MHD), socio-demographic patterning, and relationships with physical health and cognitive development.We analysed the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) when children were aged 11 years. Maternal (n = 12,082) and teacher (n = 6739) reports of prosocial behaviours (PS) and learning skills (LS) were entered into latent class models to create MHC measures. Using descriptive statistics, we examined relationships between MHC and MHD, and the socio-demographic patterning of MHC. Associations between MHC and physical health and cognitive development were examined with relative risk ratios [RRR] (from multinomial models): BMI status (healthy weight, overweight, ); unintentional injuries since age 7 (none, 1, 2+); asthma symptoms (none, 1, 2+); and tertiles of test scores for verbal ability, spatial working memory and risk-taking. Models were adjusted for potential confounding.Four MHC classes were identified [percentages for maternal and teacher reports, respectively]: high MHC (high PS, high LS) [37%; 39%], high-moderate MHC (high PS, moderate LS) [36%; 26%]; moderate MHC (moderate PS, moderate LS) [19%; 19%]; low MHC (moderate PS, low LS) [8%; 16%]. Higher MHC was less common in socially disadvantaged children. While MHC and MHD were associated, there was sufficient separation to indicate that MHC captures more than the absence of MHD. Compared to children with high MHC, those in other MHC classes tended to have poorer physical health and cognitive development, particularly those with low MHC or high-moderate MHC. For example, children with maternal-report Low MHC were more likely to have experienced 2+ unintentional injuries (RRR: 1.5 [1.1-2.1]) and to have lower verbal ability scores (RRR: 2.5 [1.9-3.2]). Patterns of results were similar for maternal- and teacher-report MHC.MHC is not simply the inverse of MHD, and high MHC is associated with better physical health and cognitive development.

The average rating of Extension's leadership across multiple dimensions by 3 coalition members in a postproject survey was "excellent" on a 5-point Likert scale.Extension is well positioned through their mission, broad community engagement, data collection, needs assessment, community and academic relationships, and embeddedness in local communities to serve as the backbone support organizations for rural physical activity promotion coalitions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692255>Weight gain velocity in infants with achondroplasia.</a></h2><p>There are virtually no data regarding appropriate oral intake in infants with dwarfing disorders such as achondroplasia, nor is there clear information regarding appropriate weight gain velocity in this population. Yet, these individuals are at increased risk for both early failure to thrive and, later in life, for . Having appropriate expectations regarding weight gain and reasonable goals in management is imperative. We sought to clarify the rate of weight gain in infants with achondroplasia during the first year of life through analysis of data from 60 infants with achondroplasia seen at least twice during the first year of life in the Midwest Regional Bone Dysplasia Clinic, University of Wisconsin-Madison between 1998 and 2018. The mean weight gain velocity during the first 3 months was 23 g/day which contrasts with 30 g/day in average statured infants. Mean weight gain from 0 to 12 months of age was 13 g/day. The 3% of weight gain velocity during the first year of life was 8 g/day, and this rate did not differ between 0-3 months and 0-12 months of age. Infants with achondroplasia slightly more than doubled their birth weights by 1 year of age in contrast to averaged statured infants who typically triple birth weights by 1 year. Infants with achondroplasia can be thriving but erroneously assessed as failing to thrive if the incorrect reference values are used.

Upon activation or inhibition by central and systemic factors, such as neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, and nutrients, these molecules play important roles in the regulation of neuronal responses that control whole-body energy homeostasis. Dietary fats can control hypothalamic function by acting upon distinct energy sensing systems. They can be metabolized inside neurons, producing signals that control the expression of neurotransmitters involved in energy homeostasis; moreover, excessive amounts of certain fatty acids can activate inflammatory signaling in microglia, astrocytes, and neurons, leading to functional abnormalities and, eventually, neuronal apoptosis. In addition, recent studies have identified lipid-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors in the hypothalamus, revealing their involvement in the regulation of caloric intake and energy expenditure, as well as in the hypothalamic inflammatory response that occurs in . Because of advances in the generation of synthetic ligands for this class of receptors, it is expected that pharmacological modulation of selected lipid-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors in the central nervous system could provide therapeutic advances in  and other metabolic diseases.

Bariatric surgery is a proven, effective method for sustained weight loss. However, there is a relative paucity of data on the impact of bariatric surgery on renal outcomes.The primary objective was to evaluate the change in urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in patients undergoing bariatric surgery, at 12 months after the procedure. Secondary objectives were to determine the changes in ACR at (6 and 24 months), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; 6, 12, and 24 months), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); 12 and 24 months) after the procedure.This observational retrospective cohort study included consecutive obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery.Provincial Bariatric Surgery Clinic at the Regina General Hospital, Saskatchewan.This study includes 471 consecutive obese adult patients who underwent bariatric surgery between 2008 and 2015.We studied the impact of bariatric surgery on body mass index (BMI), renal outcomes (urine ACR and eGFR) and metabolic outcomes (fasting glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and HbA1c) in 471 patients.Patients were followed for 2 years postsurgery in the bariatric clinic. Mixed linear models that accounted for the repeated nature of the data were used to access changes in outcomes over time.Patients were predominantly female (81%) with a mean age (±SD) of 46 ± 10 years. Most patients (87%) had a BMI > 40 kg/m and 81% of the patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The mean BMI decreased from 47.7 ± 7.8 kg/m at baseline to 37.1 ± 7.9 kg/m at 6 months and 34.8 ± 8.8 kg/m at 12 months. In a subcohort of patients with microalbuminuria, ACR showed an improvement from a median [interquartile] value of 5.1 [3.7-7.5] mg/mmol at baseline to 2.3 [1.2-3.6] mg/mmol at 6 months ( = .007), to 1.4 [0.9-3.7] mg/mmol at 2-year follow-up ( < .001). Similarly, eGFR increased in patients with microalbuminuria from 109 ± 10 mL/min/1.73 m at baseline to 120 ± 36 mL/min/1.73 m at 2-year follow-up ( = .013). There were statistically significant reductions in triglycerides, fasting glucose, and HbA1c.This was a retrospective chart review, with the lack of a control group. Patients with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m were not considered for surgery, and we had to measure renal outcomes predominantly on the presence of proteinuria.Our results suggest bariatric surgery significantly decreased weight and consequently improved renal and metabolic outcomes (eGFR, ACR, fasting glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides) in patients with elevated BMI.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697661>Diagnostic delays and treatment challenges in children with coeliac disease: The New Zealand Coeliac Health Survey.</a></h2><p>Coeliac disease (CD) is an increasingly common immune-mediated disorder. Treatment is a life-long gluten-free diet. The aim of this study was to describe the presenting symptoms, delays in diagnosis and difficulties associated with managing CD in children.The New Zealand Coeliac Health Survey was undertaken in collaboration with Coeliac New Zealand Incorporated, whose membership was the study population. The questionnaire enquired about presenting and ongoing symptoms, and challenges associated with treatment. Children aged <16 years were included in this analysis. Proportions and the mean or median were calculated, as appropriate.There were 123 children with doctor-diagnosed CD. The median age at diagnosis was 4 years (range 0-13 years). The median time between symptom onset and diagnosis was 1.5 years (range 0-11 years). Despite a gluten-free diet, many children continued to experience symptoms, which were most commonly attributed to an unknown cause (61.8%), hidden sources of gluten (44.1%) or food allergy (29.4%). Families found that following a gluten-free diet was very (12%) or moderately (31%) difficult, particularly when eating out.Recognition of the challenges associated with the diagnosis and treatment of CD in childhood is an important issue in addressing the needs of children with CD, and their families.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696557>Analytical performance of canine acylated and unacylated ghrelin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.</a></h2><p>Ghrelin is a major appetite-stimulating hormone.

In , adipokines released from expanding adipose tissue are implicated in disease progression and metabolic dysfunction. However, mechanisms controlling the progression of adiposity and metabolic complications are not fully understood. It has been suggested that expanding fat mass and sustained release of inflammatory adipokines in adipose tissue lead to hypoxia, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cellular damage. These changes trigger an immune response involving infiltration of adipose tissue with immune cells, complement activation and generation of factors involved in opsonization and clearance of damaged cells. Abundant evidence now indicates that adipose tissue is an active secretory source of complement and complement-related adipokines that, in addition to their inflammatory role, contribute to the regulation of metabolic function. This article highlights advances in knowledge regarding the role of these adipokines in energy regulation of adipose tissue through modulating lipogenic and lipolytic pathways. Several adipokines will be discussed including adipsin, Factor H, properdin, C3a, Acylation-Stimulating Protein, C1q/TNF-related proteins, and response gene to complement-32 (RGC-32). Interactions between these factors will be described considering their immune-metabolic roles in the adipose tissue microenvironment and their potential contribution to progression of adiposity and metabolic dysfunction. The differential expression and the role of complement factors in gender-related fat partitioning will also be addressed. Identifying lipogenic adipokines and their specific autocrine/paracrine roles may provide means for adipose-tissue-targeted therapeutic interventions that may disrupt the vicious circle of adiposity and disease progression. © 2019 American Physiological Society.

However, recent food consumption patterns have not been fully assessed. In the present study, our aim was therefore to describe the current food consumption from the "anthropometric data, macronutrients and micronutrients intake, practice of physical activity, socioeconomic data and lifestyles in Spain" (ANIBES) study population by assessing data defined by age and gender. The ANIBES study is a cross-sectional study of a nationally representative sample of the Spanish population. A three-day dietary record was used to obtain information about food and beverage consumption. The sample comprised 2009 individuals aged 9-75 years, plus a boost sample for the youngest age groups (9-12, 13-17, and 18-24 years,  = 200 per age group). The most consumed food group across all age segments were non-alcoholic beverages followed by milk and dairy products and vegetables. Consumption of cereals and derivatives, milk and dairy products, sugars and sweets, and ready-to-eat meals by children was significantly higher than those by the adult and older adult populations ( ≤ 0.05). Conversely, intakes of vegetables, fruits, and fish and shellfish were significantly higher in adults and older adults ( ≤ 0.05). In order to comply with recommendations, adherence to the Mediterranean dietary patterns should be strengthened, especially amongst younger population groups. Therefore, substantial nutritional interventions may be targeted to improve the Spanish population's dietary patterns nowadays.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694594>Tobacco use and associated risk factors in Burkina Faso: results from a population-based cross-sectional survey.</a></h2><p>Tobacco is a leading preventable cause of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Studies characterizing the prevalence of tobacco use in low-income countries are lacking. This study describes the prevalence of tobacco use in Burkina Faso and its associated factors.Data from the 2013 Burkina Faso World Health Organization (WHO) Stepwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS) were analyzed. The prevalence of any tobacco product use, cigarette smoking, and other tobacco use was calculated. Logistic regression analyses identified factors associated with tobacco use. Overall, 4691 people were included in this analysis.The prevalence of any tobacco use was 19.8% (95% CI: 18.4-21.2). Tobacco use was higher for men (29.2% [27.0-31.5]) than women (11.8% [10.3-13.4]). The prevalence of smoked tobacco was 11.3% (10.3-12.4), with a significantly higher prevalence among men (24.5% [22.1-27.0]) than women (0.1% [0.01-0.3]). The overall prevalence of other tobacco use was 8.9% (7.4-10.7), with lower values for men (5.6% [4.1-7.2]) compared to women (11.7% [9.4-14.1]). Tobacco smoking among men was significantly associated with an increased age and alcohol consumption. The analysis of risk factors for other tobacco use stratified by gender showed that age, education, residence, and alcohol consumption were significantly associated with consumption for women, and age and alcohol consumption for men.Tobacco use is common in Burkina Faso.

This qualitative study aims to describe barriers and facilitators, at organisational and personal levels, that teachers and parents in disadvantaged settings in Sweden perceived as influencing the implementation of the Healthy School Start II (HSS II) intervention.Data collection, analysis and interpretation were guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Focus groups and interviews were conducted with 14 parents and ten teachers within the HSS II trial. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis in a deductive step using the three CFIR domains-inner and outer setting, and personal characteristics-followed by an inductive analysis.The theme 'being on the same page-getting burdened teachers and parents to work on common ground' was found. Among teachers, barriers and facilitators were related to the structure of the schoolwork and curriculum, involvement from other staff and school management, the practical school workday, perception of high family needs but low parental interest, insufficient resources in the families, and teacher's personal knowledge, interests, and opinions about health and food. For parents, barriers and facilitators were related to the perceived family needs and resources, parents' health knowledge, consensus about healthy behaviours and ability to cooperate, and school involvement in health issues and the intervention.Interventions should facilitate parents' and teachers' work on common ground, with activities suitable for a stressful and burdensome workday and everyday life. This could be achieved by integrating evidence-based practices within school routines, and including activities that are practicable despite parents' stressful lives, and that increase parental consensus about promoting health. Strategies to increase involvement of parents in families with high needs are necessary.

Adipose tissue is considered one of the largest endocrine organs in the body as well as an active tissue for cellular reactions and metabolic homeostasis rather than an inert tissue only for energy storage. The functional pleiotropism of adipose tissue relies on its ability to synthesize and release a large number of hormones, cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins, and growth and vasoactive factors, which are collectively called adipokines known to influence a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. In the obese state, excessive visceral fat accumulation causes adipose tissue dysfunctionality that strongly contributes to the onset of -related comorbidities.

The sequence of underfeeding and overfeeding impacts the method inherent assumptions, and the considerable day-to-day and inter-individual variance in body composition changes is a challenge to the precision of methods. Weight loss-associated changes in body composition do not resemble their changes with subsequent hypercaloric re-feeding. Individual body components are related to specific metabolic functions where the structure-function relationships change with changes in energy balance. Analysis of structure-function relationships in response to weight changes needs to address (a) the validity, precision, and different outcome parameters of body composition methods and (b) the variance of results taking into account study protocols and the dynamics of weight changes. As for future studies, repeated measurements of body weight, body composition, and metabolic functions are needed before, during, and after weight changes focusing on the intra- and interindividual variances of weight change rather than on mean data only.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696962>Acetaminophen use in pregnancy: Examining prevalence, timing, and indication of use in a prospective birth cohort.</a></h2><p>Previous studies of prenatal acetaminophen use have not addressed what indications and maternal co-factors describe acetaminophen use.The objective of this study was to describe these parameters in a well-characterised, prospective birth cohort.Data were drawn from the MotherToBaby study of pregnant women enrolled from 2004 to 2018.

Twelve per cent had undefined duration of use. Increasing duration of exposure was associated with tobacco use, , self-reported depression or anxiety, and antidepressant use. The most frequently reported indication was headache, however, indication varied by duration of use, with more women reporting use for sleep or pain/injury in the categories with the longest duration of use. Median dose per exposed day was highest among those reporting use for sleep, and higher doses were more frequently reported for arthritis, injury, and pain.Acetaminophen is used by the majority of pregnant women, and some continue to use for many weeks in pregnancy. Given the heterogeneity in duration of use, indication, and dose, studies that estimate the risk of adverse outcomes associated with acetaminophen must carefully consider these factors.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694224>The Latest Insights into Adipokines in Diabetes.</a></h2><p>The Special Issue "Pathogenetic and Therapeutic Significance of Adipokines in Diabetes" focused on adipokines as shared diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for both  and type 2 diabetes.

In fact, older patients will soon constitute the majority of patients with T2D in most developed countries. The higher prevalence of T2D in older individuals is seen in both men and women and across racial and ethnic groups. However, certain ethnic groups are disproportionately affected and successful strategies must account for these fundamental differences. T2D in old age is associated with traditional diabetes-associated complications including micro- and macro vascular disease, but is also closely related to numerous other comorbidities including cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, sarcopenia, and increased fall risk. An overall state of chronic inflammation and dysregulated immune system may underlie these increased risks; yet our understanding of immunometabolism during the aging process remains incomplete. In addition, optimal recognition and treatment of diabetes in the elderly is hampered by a lack of relevant, high-quality studies, as the majority of clinical trial data establishing risk profiles, glycemic targets, and therapeutic interventions for T2D are not applicable for large segments of the older patient population. Simply acknowledging this gap is inadequate. We need strong evidence-based data upon which to successfully identify diabetic patients and then intervene in ways that are targeted to specific individuals within a heterogeneous group of elderly patients with T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695662>Food-Specific Inhibitory Control Mediates the Effect of Disgust Sensitivity on Body Mass Index.</a></h2><p>Disgust is an emotion that drives food avoidance. People vary in their responses to disgust, which is captured by their disgust sensitivity. Disgust sensitivity is clinically significant because it can influence eating behaviors, and indirectly people's body mass index (BMI). Inhibitory control can also influence BMI through the role that such reflective abilities play in governing food intake. In this study, we relied on neural models of disgust to suggest that disgust and inhibitory control are intertwined, and that inhibitory control facilitates the translation of disgust sensitivity into BMI. Mediation analyses applied to 46 subjects, including 29 normal body weight [BMI = 18.34 kg/m (SD = 1.58)] and 17 overweight/obese [BMI = 26.03 kg/m (SD = 2.58)] subjects, were used to test the hypothesis. Subjects completed the Chinese version of the Disgust Scale-Revised, and an inhibition control test (Food-Specific Stop-Signal Task). There were negative correlations between the disgust sensitivity score (DS) and body mass index (BMI), and between DS and stop-signal reaction time (SSRT). Moreover, BMI was positively correlated with SSRT. The mediation model results showed that disgust sensitivity was associated with BMI and that this relationship was mediated  inhibition control. There was no significant effect of DS on BMI, while the effect of SSRT on BMI was significant. This suggested that the effect of disgust sensitivity on BMI was fully mediated through food-specific inhibitory control. This supports our hypothesis that BMI is affected by disgust sensitivity and that this relationship is mediated by inhibition control. These findings reveal a key mechanism that underlies disgust sensitivity-BMI association and point to future research and potential interventions aimed at food intake management.Copyright © 2019 Liu, Li, Turel, Chen and He.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694434>Hypoglycaemic effect of resveratrol in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats is impaired when supplemented in association with leucine.</a></h2><p>Studies have shown synergistic and independent effects of leucine and resveratrol (RSV) as possible therapeutic agents to ameliorate metabolic disorders. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of supplementation with leucine and RSV, alone and in combination, on metabolic changes in white adipose tissue of neonatally STZ-induced diabetic rats. After weaning, the rats were treated with trans-resveratrol (0.6 mg/kg/dose) and/or leucine (1.35 mg/kg/dose) administered orally. The animals were euthanized at age 16 weeks for blood analyses. Subcutaneous (SC), periepididymal (PE) and retroperitoneal (RP) fat pads were weighed. Adipocytes from PE and RP pads were isolated for morphometric analysis. Long-term supplementation with RSV promoted adiposity recovery, prevented hypoinsulinemia and improved the metabolic profile of the diabetic rats. However, some of these effects were impaired when RSV was associated with leucine. The diabetic rats supplemented with leucine alone showed no significant improvement in metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687313>Relationship between Night Eating Syndrome and Self-esteem: A Cross-sectional Population-based Study in Karachi, Pakistan.</a></h2><p>Background The amount of literature shedding light upon eating disorders in developing countries, such as Pakistan, is scarce. This is partially because talking about such matters is considered taboo in the general population. Night Eating Syndrome's (NES) link with depression and  has been established; however, presently, no study has been conducted which solely focuses on NES's correlation with self-esteem. Therefore, to bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted this study to assess the prevalence of NES in Karachi and its association with self-esteem. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in August 2018 using convenience sampling in 395 individuals, out of which 197 belonged to the age group 18-24 and 198 to 25-30. The participants were interviewed for their gender, body mass index (BMI), and their level of education. The participants were asked to complete a structured, standardized questionnaire assessment, which comprised of questions from the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale (RSE). The eating habits of the participants and the level of self-esteem were assessed using four- and five-point Likert scales. Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests were used as the primary statistical tests. Results Out of the 395 respondents, more than half of the respondents were females (n = 235/395, 59.5%). About one-fourth (n = 92/395, 23.3%) of the participants had a BMI of greater than 25.0 kg/m. More than one-third of the underweight (n = 20/55, 36.4%) and overweight population (n = 33/92, 35.9%) had low self-esteem, while more than one-fourth (n = 25/92, 27.2%) of the overweight participants fulfilled the criteria of NES. The final outcomes showed that 14.4% of the participants had NES, and 4.6% of the participants had low self-esteem. Conclusion Our results pointed out to a significant relationship between NES and self-esteem. Furthermore, NES and self-esteem also had a significant association with age, gender, and BMI. Additionally, awareness regarding eating and mental disorders should be done in countries like Pakistan, where talking in regard to such matters is considered taboo. Given the various factors that further strengthen the positive relationship between NES and low self-esteem, these factors can be the targets on which the treatment can be focused.Copyright © 2019, Batra et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691571>[Consumption of sugary drinks and sugar added to beverages and their relation ship with nutritional status in young people of Medellin (Colombia)].</a></h2><p>Worldwide, there is a high prevalence of overweight and  in children and young people, the etiology is multicausal and influences environmental, cultural and eating habits factors such as the consumption of sugary drinks and added sugar that promote excess weight and risk of chronic diseases.To identify the relationship between the amount ingested of sugary drinks (BA) and added sugar (AA) with the nutritional status of young people.Cross sectional study, carried out in 596 individuals, between 10 and 18 years, the evaluation of dietary intake was made through Reminder 24 hours (R24H), for each of the individuals was considered the Best Linear Predictor Insleegue (MPLI) of energy,% AMDR of the total CHOS (acceptable range of distribution of macronutrients) and of the simple CHOS; the nutritional status was classified according to Z score of the body mass index (BMI) and percentage of body fat (% GC).

Unlike that of common pituitary adenoma, the association between pituicytoma and Cushing disease (CD) is extremely rare. There were only 6 reported cases till now. In the current study, we describe an unusual case of pituicytoma associated with severe CD with a recurrence-free follow-up period of 49 months.A 32-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with moon face, central , and purple stripes on the lower limbs.The plasma cortisol level was 1122 nmol/L. The low-dose dexamethasone suppression test failed to suppress plasma cortisol. This test provided evidence of nonpituitary-dependent CD. However, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a sellar mass measuring approximately 7.6 × 5.7 mm. The patient was diagnosed with pituitary microadenoma. Histopathological analysis of the tissue sections based on the findings from the immunohistochemical staining diagnosed it as pituicytoma.Transsphenoidal surgery was performed to remove the pituitary mass.Within 2 months postoperatively, the patient's blood pressure and cortisol level decreased gradually and normalized on the 6th month when other symptoms of CD also disappeared. The patient is presently free from recurrence 49 months after the initial diagnosis.Based on the postoperative remission, CD was caused by pituitary disorders. A reasonable assumption is that an extremely small coexisting adenoma was not detected by the surgeon and washed out during the dissection. Another possible explanation might be the mass effect caused by this intrasellar lesion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691175>Metabolic Syndrome in Children and Adolescents: Diagnostic Criteria, Therapeutic Options and Perspectives.</a></h2><p>This review summarizes our current understanding of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in children and adolescents. Special emphasis is given towards diagnostic criteria and therapeutic options.Consistent diagnostic criteria to define MetS in childhood and adolescence are not available to date. There is common agreement that the main features defining MetS include (1) disturbed glucose metabolism, (2) arterial hypertension, (3) dyslipidemia, and (4) abdominal . However, settings of cut-off values are still heterogeneous in the pediatric population. Additional features that may define cardiometabolic risk, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFDL) or hyperuricemia, are not considered to date. Prevalence of childhood  has more than doubled since 1980, and 6-39% of obese children and adolescents already present with MetS, depending on the definition applied. There is common agreement that a consistent definition of MetS is urgently needed for children to identify those at risk as early as possible. Such definition criteria should consider age, gender, pubertal stage, or ethnicity. Additional features such as NAFDL or hyperuricemia should also be included in MetS criteria. Lifestyle modification is still the main basis to prevent or treat childhood  and MetS, as other therapeutic options (pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery) are not available or not recommended for the majority of affected youngster.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693992>Physical Activity in Older Cancer Survivors: What Role Do Multimorbidity and Perceived Disability Play?</a></h2><p>(a) To describe the relationship of multimorbidity and physical activity (PA) in cancer survivors and (b) to explore perceived disability and PA in middle-aged and older survivors.The authors analyzed the data from cancer survivors (N = 566), identified using the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry, who responded to a Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System-derived questionnaire. They created age groups (e.g., 45-54 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years, and 75 years and older) and calculated a composite score of eight common comorbidities (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease) to assess multimorbidity. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association of demographic and behavioral/clinical risk factors (e.g., multimorbidity, perceived disability, body mass index) with PA.Most respondents were females (62%), older (mean age = 68 years) and represented diverse cancer sites, including breast (n = 132), colorectal (n = 102), gynecologic (n = 106), prostate (n = 111), and lung (n = 80). PA participation was mixed; 44% of survivors reported achieving >150 min of aerobic PA, but half of lung and 37% of gynecologic survivors reported no PA (0 min/week). Higher multimorbidity (odds ratio = 0.82, confidence  interval [0.69, 0.98], p < .05),  (odds ratio = 0.51, confidence  interval [0.30, 0.86], p < .05), and perceived disability (odds ratio = 0.49, confidence  interval [0.32, 0.77], p < .001) were negatively associated with PA participation. Strength training was suboptimal across all survivors.Most older survivors experienced comorbid conditions, and this was associated with less PA. Survivors who perceived themselves as disabled or who were obese were half as likely as others to participate in PA. This suggests an increasing need to address both physical and psychological limitations in designing PA interventions for real-world needs. Exercise interventions that address the unique needs of older survivors for multimorbidity, , and perceived disability may strengthen opportunities for PA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698334>Evaluating the Feasibility, Acceptability, and Effects of Deposit Contracts With and Without Daily Feedback to Promote Physical Activity.</a></h2><p>Despite interest in financial incentive programs, evidence regarding the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of deposit contracts (ie, use of participants' own money as a financial reward) for increasing physical activity (PA) is limited. Furthermore, evidence regarding the use of feedback within incentive programs is limited.To evaluate: (1) the feasibility and acceptability of deposit contracts for increasing objectively measured PA and (2) the effects of deposit contracts with or without ongoing feedback on PA.Participants (n = 24) were exposed to 3 conditions (1) self-monitoring, (2) incentive, and (3) incentive with feedback in an ABACABAC design, with the order of incentive conditions counterbalanced across participants.Effect sizes suggest that individuals had a modest increase in PA during the incentive conditions compared with self-monitoring. Presentation order moderated results, such that individuals exposed to incentives with feedback first performed more poorly across both incentive conditions. In addition, individuals often cited the deposit contract as a reason for not enrolling, and those who did participate reported inadequate acceptability of the incentives and feedback.Results suggest that while deposit contracts may engender modest increases in PA, this type of incentive may not be feasible or acceptable for promoting PA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696669>Aromatase Inhibitors and Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators: unconventional therapies for functional hypogonadism?</a></h2><p>Functional hypogonadism increases in prevalence due to ageing as well as an overall increase of . Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) could be an alternative for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), but have not yet been established as common clinical practice.We conducted a thorough search of the literature published between 2009 and 2018. Only RCTs published in English were included. We assessed the impact of AIs and SERMs on gonadal steroids, sexual function and semen parameters, body composition and glucose homeostasis, physical function, bone mineral density (BMD), anemia, as well as potential adverse effects.12 RCTs were included, with a total number of 645 patients. 145 men were included in RCTs comparing AIs versus placebo or TRT and 476 men in RCTs with SERMs versus placebo or TRT. One RCT compared AIs versus SERMs in 24 men. Inclusion criteria were heterogenic. Most studies only included a small number of patients (range 11-256) and follow-up time was relatively short (6 weeks to 12 months). AIs as well as SERMs increased serum testosterone levels. Overall, there was no effect on sexual symptoms nor on semen parameters. Following aromatase inhibition, only minimal improvement of body composition and physical function was observed in some of the trials, but spinal BMD decreased. SERMs only induced a small improvement in body composition. The effect of SERMs on physical function and on BMD was not assessed. No major adverse effects occurred.AIs are not recommended as treatment for functional hypogonadism because of insufficient efficacy as well as a decrease in BMD. SERMs might be an alternative for TRT, but more research is needed to evaluate their effect on hypogonadal signs and symptoms, as well as on their long-term safety profile.© 2019 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689013>Hyper-Palatable Foods: Development of a Quantitative Definition and Application to the US Food System Database.</a></h2><p>Extensive research has focused on hyper-palatable foods (HPF); however, HPF are defined using descriptive terms (e.g., fast foods, sweets), which are not standardized and lack specificity. The study purpose was to develop a quantitative definition of HPF and apply the definition to the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) to determine HPF prevalence in the US food system.A numeric definition of HPF was developed by extracting common HPF descriptive definitions from the literature and using nutrition software to quantify ingredients of fat, simple sugars, carbohydrates, and sodium. The definition was applied to the FNDDS.HPF from the literature aligned with three clusters: (1) fat and sodium (> 25% kcal from fat, ≥ 0.30% sodium by weight), (2) fat and simple sugars (> 20% kcal from fat, > 20% kcal from sugar), and (3) carbohydrates and sodium (> 40% kcal from carbohydrates, ≥ 0.20% sodium by weight). In the FNDDS, 62% (4,795/7,757) of foods met HPF criteria. The HPF criteria identified a variety of foods, including some labeled reduced or low fat and vegetables cooked in creams, sauces, or fats.A data-derived HPF definition revealed that a substantial percentage of foods in the US food system may be hyper-palatable, including foods not previously conceptualized as hyper-palatable.© 2019 The  Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689007>Dietary Weight Loss, Exercise, and Inflammation in Older Adults with Overweight or  and Cardiometabolic Disease.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to examine exercise modality during weight loss on change in inflammation among older adults with overweight or  and cardiometabolic disease.A total of 222 older adults with a mean (SD) age of 66.9 (4.7) years and a mean (SD) BMI of 33.5 (3.5) kg/m were randomized to weight loss (WL; n = 68), WL plus aerobic training (WL + AT; n = 79), or WL plus resistance training (WL + RT; n = 75) for 18 months.

Cd is a toxic heavy metal, and is widely present in environment. It has been reported that chronic Cd exposure is associated with kidney disease, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Smoking causes exposure to significantly higher Cd levels in humans. Tobacco smoke transports Cd into the lungs. Blood then transport it to the rest of the body where it increases effects by potentiating Cd that is already present from Cd-rich food. Other high exposures of Cd can occur with people, who live near hazardous waste sites, or factories that release Cd into the air and people who work in the metal refinery industry. Breathing of Cd can severely damage the lungs and may even cause death. Multiple studies have shown an association between environmental exposure to hazardous chemicals including toxic metals and , diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

A sham group (without STZ) was also included. Levels of blood glucose were monitored at each week. After continuous treatment of each diet for 24 days, a glucose tolerance test was performed. After 28 days of treatment, plasma biochemical indicators including glycated serum proteins, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured and immunohistochemistry staining of the rat pancreas was performed, to study the insulin expressions. Type 2 diabetes was developed in db/db mice. A total of 28 db/db mice were divided into 4 groups: vehicle control (db/db group), KI composition group (KI group), konjac extract group (konjac group), and inulin extract group (inulin group). A wild-type control group (wild-type group) for db/db mice was also included. Levels of blood glucose, body weight, and blood triglycerides were monitored at each week.Daily use of the KI composition significantly decreased levels of blood glucose and blood triglycerides, as well as improved the insulin production in islets or reduced development of  in STZ-induced diabetic rats or in db/db mice. Such effects from KI composition were better than single ingredient of konjac or inulin extract.The results of this study suggest that daily use of KI composition has a protective role on type 1 and 2 diabetes and provided experimental basis for further development of KI composition as a food supplement for diabetic or diabetic high-risk population.Copyright © 2019 Tianle Gao et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689600>Huoxue Qianyang decoction ameliorates cardiac remodeling in obese spontaneously hypertensive rats in association with ATF6-CHOP endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathway regulation.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in hypertension related cardiac remodeling.

The expression levels of GRP78, ATF6, PERK/pPERK and CHOP were assessed by quantitative PCR and Western blot.Treatment with HXQY decoction resulted in significantly reduced SBP, BW, LVMI, Ang II, TC and LDL-C levels, as well as the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score in obese SHRs. Apoptosis in heart tissues of obese SHRs was significantly attenuated after HXQY decoction administration, paralleling reduced expression of GRP78, ATF6, PERK/pPERK and CHOP at both mRNA and protein levels.Cardiac remodeling in obese SHRs is ameliorated by intervention with HXQY decoction in association with inhibited ATF6-CHOP ER stress signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

I highlight several recent advances in basic science that are relevant for the diabetes field, with insight into how the key takeaways impact basic science. I also speculate on how these breakthroughs challenge the field to move the basic science "discovery" into the clinic, as well as offering a perspective on unanswered questions in relation to these advances. The review should in no way be taken as an endorsement of the highlighted work or a denunciation of any work not selected. Rather, it is a personal reflection that provides a glimpse into what is on the horizon in this rapidly evolving and exciting field!</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696091>Metabolic syndrome and 10-year risk of cardiovascular events among schizophrenia inpatients treated with antipsychotics.</a></h2><p> The metabolic syndrome is highly prevalent among patients with schizophrenia. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and the risk of cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years among schizophrenic patients.  This cross sectional study was performed on 100 Iranian patients with schizophrenia in 2016. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was determined by adult treatment panel III criteria, and 10-year cardiovascular risk was calculated by Framingham Risk Score. SPSS software was used to perform statistical analysis. Chi-square and Fisher's exact or extended Fisher's exact tests were used to compare dichotomous variables. Also, Mann-Whitney U test was applied to compare the quantitative variables. Significance level was considered to be less than or equal to 0.05.  In this study, 83 participants (83%) were male and 17 (17%) were female. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 27% (21.7% in males and 52.9% in females, p=0.015). Among all components of metabolic syndrome, low HDL-C in men and abdominal  in females were the most common disorders. Based on Framingham Risk Score, 76%, 16%, and 8% of patients had low, intermediate, and high level of risk, respectively. A significant difference was observed between the level of risk among participants with and without metabolic syndrome (p=0.042).  In this study, patients with schizophrenia showed a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome, but most of them had low risk of developing cardiovascular disease. These results suggest regular screening and early interventions to modify the risk factors of metabolic syndrome.© 2019 Iran University of Medical Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689006>Early Nonfood Parent-Infant Interactions and Development of  in a High-Risk, Diverse Sample.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to understand the protective role of positive mother-infant interactions in the context of food and nonfood behaviors against  risk later in life among a cohort of low-income children at high prenatal risk due to maternal substance use during pregnancy.The sample consisted of 216 mother-infant dyads (49% boys) participating in an ongoing longitudinal study. Mother-infant interactions during a feeding episode and a free-play task were measured at child age 1 and 7 months, respectively. Children's length/height and weight were measured at 1, 7, 13, 24, 36, and 48 months of age; at kindergarten age (approximately 60 months); and in second grade (approximately 84 months). BMI growth trajectories were modeled.No significant associations were found between mother-child feeding interactions and child BMI trajectories. Maternal warmth (95% CI: -0.020 to -0.0005; P = 0.04) and child positive affect (95% CI: -0.020 to -0.002; P = 0.014) during free play were associated with a more normative child BMI trajectory.Results from this study indicated that high maternal warmth and child positive affect during play, but not feeding interactions, are associated with reduced  risk from infancy to middle childhood in the context of high pre- and postnatal risks.© 2019 The  Society (TOS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689012>Mobilization of Environmental Toxicants Following Bariatric Surgery.</a></h2><p>Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are lipophilic environmental toxicants that accumulate in adipose tissue. Weight loss leads to mobilization and increased redistribution of these toxicants. Many are obesogens and endocrine disruptors. Increased exposure could pose long-term health risks. The study objective was to measure the changes in serum concentrations of lipophilic POPs during significant weight loss.This study enrolled 27 patients at a university hospital in a longitudinal, 6-month, observational study examining changes in POP blood levels after bariatric surgery. The primary outcome was the changes in the concentrations of 24 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 9 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), 11 polybrominated diphenyl ethers, 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl, and 4 perfluorochemicals (PFCs).Older adults (those born before 1976) had baseline levels of PCBs, OCPs, and PFCs that were two- to fivefold higher than younger adults (those born after 1976). Older adults had greater increases in PCBs, OCPs, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers associated with weight loss. Conversely, younger adults had greater increases in PFCs associated with weight loss. On average, blood POP levels increased as weight loss occurred.Although weight loss is considered beneficial, the release and redistribution of POPs to other lipid-rich organs such as the brain, kidneys, and liver warrant further investigation. Interventions should be considered to limit organ exposure to POPs when weight loss interventions are planned.© 2019 The  Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689210>Near Infrared Spectroscopy to Monitor Nutritional Status of Neonates: A Review.</a></h2><p>The World Health Organization reported that half or more of all under five deaths were caused by undernutrition in developing countries with the majority of these deaths occurring in the first week of life. Even if the undernourished neonates manage to survive, they are exposed to long-term health impacts including , cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Along with those health-impacts they can be exposed to risks related to detrimental early development such as physical impairment, stunting, brain dysfunction, and reduced cognitive development. Body fat percentage has been recognized to be closely associated with undernutrition in neonates. In this paper, the potential of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), along with previous methods to measure body fat in neonates, is reviewed and discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686874>Impact of arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes on cardiac autonomic modulation in obese individuals with recommendation for bariatric surgery.</a></h2><p>Obese individuals with recommendation for bariatric surgery (BS) exhibit increased cardiovascular risk. The association of  with comorbidities, such as arterial hypertension (HTN) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can worsen cardiovascular dysfunction. This study aimed to investigate the effect of HTN on cardiac autonomic function and whether diabetes exacerbates HTN-related impairment of autonomic function in obese subjects.Samples (n=63) were allocated to three groups: Obese without HTN and T2DM (n=29), Obese with HTN (OHTN, n=17) and OHTN with T2DM (OHTN+T2DM, n=17), in which anthropometric measures, body composition, blood biochemical parameters, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate variability (HRV) were evaluated.The age was higher in OHTN+T2DM and OHTN than in obese groups (<0.05). OHTN+T2DM individuals had increased neck circumference and compromised glycemic profile when compared to obese and OHTN groups (<0.05). Mean values for standard deviation of RR (SDRR), square root of the mean squared differences of successive RR interval (RMSSD) and number of pairs of successive normal-to-normal beat intervals that differed by 50 ms (pRR50) were significantly lower in OHTN+T2DM and OHTN groups when compared to patients with  alone (<0.05). The low frequency (LF), low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio were higher in the OHTN+T2DM and OHTN than subjects with  alone (<0.05). Nonlinear parameters SD2 and SD1 were also lower in the OHTN+T2DM when compared to the obese group (<0.05). However, the SD2/SD1 ratio was higher in the OHTN+T2DM and OHTN groups than the obese group.T2DM and/or HTN impair the cardiac autonomic function in obese patients. However, the presence of T2DM did not exacerbate the hypertension-related impairment of autonomic function.© 2019 Carvalho et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690958>Nox1-derived oxidative stress as a common pathogenic link between  and hyperoxaluria-related kidney injury.</a></h2><p>Specific relationships among reactive oxygen species, activation pathways, and inflammatory mechanisms involved in kidney injury were assessed in a combined model of  and hyperoxaluria. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Control, HFD (high fat diet), OX (0.75% ethylene glycol), and HFD + OX (combined model) Changes in basal O levels were evaluated by chemiluminescence in renal interlobar arteries and renal cortex. Furthermore, the effect of different inhibitors on NADPH-stimulated O generation was assessed in renal cortex. Oxidative stress sources, and local inflammatory mediators, were also determined, in parallel, by RT-PCR, and correlated with measures of renal function, urinary biochemistry, and renal structure. Rats from the HFD group developed overweight without lipid profile alteration. Tubular deposits of crystals were seen in OX and severely enhanced in HFD + OX groups along with a significantly higher impairment of renal function. Basal oxidative stress was increased in renal cortex of OX rats and in renal arteries of HFD rats, while animals from the combined HFD + OX group exhibited the highest levels of oxidative stress in renal cortex, derived from xanthine oxidase and COX-2. NADPH oxidase-dependent O generation was elevated in renal cortex of the OX group and markedly enhanced in the HFD + OX rats, and associated to an up-regulation of Nox1 and a down-regulation of Nox4 expression. High levels of oxidative stress in the kidney, of OX and HFD + OX groups were also associated to an inflammatory response mediated by an elevation of TNFα, COX-2, NFκB1 MCP-1, and OPN. Oxidative stress is a key pathogenic factor in renal disease associated to hyperoxaluria and a common link underlying the exacerbated inflammatory response and kidney injury found under conditions of both  and hyperoxaluria. Nox1 pathway must be considered as a potential therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693504>Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Weight Loss, Comorbidities, and Biochemical Outcomes From Randomized Controlled Trials.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to compare weight loss, -related comorbidities, and biochemical outcomes of LSG versus LRYGB through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).LSG and LRYGB are the 2 most commonly performed bariatric surgeries for the treatment of . The comparative outcomes of the 2 surgeries is a topic of ongoing debate and medium-term outcomes remain uncertain.A search for RCTs comparing LRYGB versus LSG was conducted. Pooled outcomes between 2 procedures were compared using pairwise random-effects meta-analysis at 1, 3, and 5-year follow-up time points. Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation was used to assess certainty of evidence.Thirty-three studies involving 2475 patients were included. LRYGB resulted in greater loss of body mass index compared to LSG at 1 year [mean difference -1.25 kg/m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.01 to -0.49, P = 0.001; moderate certainty of evidence] which persisted at 3 years, but there was insufficient evidence at 5 years. Resolution of dyslipidemia was higher for LRYGB than LSG at 1 year (risk ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73, P < 0.001; moderate certainty of evidence) and 5 years (risk ratio 0.68, 95%CI 0.46-0.99, P = 0.04; low certainty of evidence). There was no difference between LRYGB and LSG for remission of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hemoglobin A1c, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, high-density lipoprotein, and the rate of 30-day major and minor complications.There are insufficient data from RCTs to draw any conclusions regarding the long-term comparative effectiveness beyond 3 years between LRYGB and LSG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689951>The Impact of a Large Bolus Dose of l-leucine and l-isoleucine on Enteroendocrine and Pancreatic Hormones, and Glycemia in Healthy, Inactive Adults.</a></h2><p>The ingestion of whey protein and amino acids with carbohydrate (CHO) enhances the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent-insulinotropic peptide (GIP) that promote insulin secretion. It is unknown if L-isoleucine (Ile) and L-leucine (Leu) have this same effect. The purpose of this study was to examine how Ile and Leu influence both GLP-1 and GIP, subsequent pancreatic hormones, and glycemia in healthy, inactive adults.Twelve adults (6F/6M; age 27.4 ± 2 years; BMI 26.3 ± 2 kg/m; lean body mass 53.2 ± 5 kg; body fat 34.1 ± 3%) completed four conditions in a randomized, cross-over fashion.

Samples of plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon, GIP, and GLP-1 were assessed.A treatment ( = 0.01) effect comparing Ile vs. Leu ( = 0.02) in GIP. Area under the curve showed an increase in GIP from Ile compared to Leu and Pla ( = 0.03). No effect was found on GLP-1. The ingestion of Ile prior to CHO augmented GIP concentration greater than Leu or Pla. No correlation was found between GIP, insulin, and glucose between conditions.Ile impacts GIP concentration, which did not relate to either insulin or glucose concentrations. Neither Ile, nor Leu seem to have an effect on hyperglycemia ingested prior to a CHO drink.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689004>Pattern of Biliary Disease Following Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy in Adolescents.</a></h2><p>The use of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has risen steadily as a treatment for adolescents with . This study determined whether obstructive biliary complications after rapid, LSG-related weight loss occur similarly in adolescents compared with adults.Between 2010 and 2019, 309 patients underwent LSG. Demographics and clinical factors, including pre- and perioperative BMI and weight changes, were included.Overall, 21 patients (7%) had post-LSG biliary disease (BD), of whom 13 presented with acute pancreatitis (AP) and 8 with biliary colic. No differences existed between those with BD (n = 21) and the remaining cohort (n = 288). Patients with BD were 16.3 (SD 2.4) years of age at LSG, with a preoperative BMI of 49.3 (SD 6.7) kg/m . Preoperative excess BMI loss was 7.1% (SD 11.3%). An ultrasound revealed gallstones (71%) and sludge or crystals (12%). Eighteen patients underwent cholecystectomy between 4 weeks and 29 months after LSG.Pediatric patients present with BD at a similar rate after LSG compared with adults. The majority of adolescents, however, manifest with AP. Thus, pancreatitis should be high on the differential diagnosis list when evaluating post-LSG abdominal symptoms. Additional studies are warranted to elucidate the pathophysiology of post-LSG AP for prevention in the future because its etiology may or may not be solely related to BD.© 2019 The  Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689010>Plasma High-Resolution Metabolomics Differentiates Adults with Normal Weight  from Lean Individuals.</a></h2><p>This study explored underlying metabolism-related dysfunction by examining metabolomic profiles in adults categorized as lean, as having normal weight  (NWO), or as having overweight/.Participants (N = 179) had fasting plasma analyzed by liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry for high-resolution metabolomics. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. NWO was defined as BMI < 25 and body fat > 30% for women and > 23% for men. Differentiating metabolomic features were determined by using linear regression models and likelihood ratio tests with false discovery rate correction. Mummichog was used for pathway and network analyses.A total of 222 metabolites significantly differed between the groups at a false discovery rate of q = 0.2. Linoleic acid, β-alanine, histidine, and aspartate/asparagine metabolism pathways were significantly enriched (all P < 0.01) by metabolites that were similarly upregulated in the NWO and overweight/ groups compared with the lean group. A module analysis linked branched-chain amino acids and amino acid metabolites as elevated in the NWO and overweight/ groups compared with the lean group (all P < 0.05).Metabolomic profiles of individuals with NWO reflected similar metabolic disruption as those of individuals with overweight/.

Spexin, a peptide hormone released from adipose tissue, is the most down-regulated gene in obese, compared to non-obese adipose tissue. Hence, it potentially contributes to the progression and development of metabolic diseases. This study was designed to evaluate serum concentration of spexin in patients with MetS compared to weight-matched and normal-weight controls.  In this case-control study, 153 participants (51 per group) were collected from October 2014 to June 2016. The study groups were all matched for age and sex and included overweight/obese individuals with MetS and 2 control groups without MetS (including weight-matched and normal-weight participants). Body composition and serum concentration of spexin and leptin were measured.  Serum leptin and spexin levels were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in normal-weight compared to overweight/obese groups with/without MetS (p< 0.02). No significant difference was observed in serum leptin and spexin concentrations between the overweight/obese groups with/without MetS (p≥ 0.05). Also, spexin, with cutoff value of 4.6, had 78% sensitivity and 82% specificity for diagnosing overweight/obese from normal-weight participants. Spexin had 78% sensitivity and specificity, with cutoff value of 4.35, in diagnosing MetS participants from normal-weight group.  This study found no correlation between the circulating level of spexin and MetS development.

The first tobacco control measure was a policy, 'Smoke-Free Government' (SFG), to create smoke-free public outdoor and indoor sites across all sites and services for staff and public users, abolish 'official' staff 'smoking breaks', and establish and promote community-wide cessation support. This paper assesses the perceived acceptability and preliminary impact of SFG in St Helena 2018-19. An online survey of government staff was undertaken 6 months post-SFG implementation to obtain insight into perceived impact, implementation, and acceptability. A population-wide health survey provided smoking prevalence and quit data prior to, and 11 months post-implementation. A majority of staff believed the policy contributed to reducing smoking, was generally observed, accepted, and entailed one or more positive effects, including reduced second-hand smoke exposure, increased quit attempts, and reduced disruption from 'smoke-breaks'. Recommendations were consistent enforcement and expanded quit support. Population data for the SFG period indicated that smoking, and particularly daily smoking declined, quit intentions increased, and quit attempts almost doubled. The SFG policy appears to have contributed positively towards stronger tobacco control in St Helena in 2018-19.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689372>FAM19A1, a brain-enriched and metabolically responsive neurokine, regulates food intake patterns and mouse behaviors.</a></h2><p>Cytokines and chemokines play diverse roles in different organ systems. Family with sequence similarity 19, member A1-5 (FAM19A1-A5; also known as TAFA1-5) is a group of conserved chemokine-like proteins enriched in the CNS of mice and humans. Their functions are only beginning to emerge. Here, we show that the expression of  in different mouse brain regions are induced or suppressed by unfed and refed states. The striking nutritional regulation of  family members in the brain suggests a potential central role in regulating metabolism. Using a knockout (KO) mouse model, we show that loss of FAM19A1 results in sexually dimorphic phenotypes. In male mice, FAM19A1 deficiency alters food intake patterns during the light and dark cycle.  KO mice are hyperactive, and locomotor hyperactivity is more pronounced in female KO mice. Behavior tests indicate that  KO female mice have reduced anxiety and sensitivity to pain. Spatial learning and exploration, however, is preserved in  KO mice. Altered behaviors are associated with elevated norepinephrine and dopamine turnover in the striatum.

To examine the association between DSSWR use and sociodemographic factors, BMI, WHR, %BF and PA multiple logistic regression were conducted.The rate of DSSWR use in the group studied was high (69.5%). A higher proportion of women, individuals aged 18-35 years, those who had completed higher education, those who did not report financial status as "poor", with a BMI < 18.5, normal %BF and individuals with a high level of PA used DSSWR. In complete case analysis (n = 1108), primarily financial status reported as "good" (OR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.69, 2.81) or "hard to say" (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.86, 3.12) (vs. "poor") and female sex (OR = 2.59, 95% CI: 2.17, 3.08) were associated with DSSWR intake.It seems that primarily financial status and sex, but also age, education, and level of PA, have significance in DSSWR use in adults and may be considered when developing appropriate strategies for body weight management and health promotion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686281>Maternal Dyslipidemia, Plasma Branched-Chain Amino Acids, and the Risk of Child Autism Spectrum Disorder: Evidence of Sex Difference.</a></h2><p>In contrast to the well-observed associations between , diabetes, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the roles of maternal dyslipidemia and sex disparity in ASD have not been well-studied. We examined the joint associations of maternal plasma cholesterols, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and child sex on child ASD risk. We analyzed data from 756 mother-infant pairs (86 ASD) from the Boston Birth Cohort. Maternal plasma cholesterols and BCAAs were measured in samples collected 24-72 h postpartum. We found that in this urban, low-income prospective birth cohort, low maternal high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), above-median maternal plasma BCAA concentrations, and male sex additively or synergistically increased risk of ASD.

Patients completed the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning to measure FC. Data were analyzed using a seed-to-voxel approach in the CONN Toolbox to investigate pre-/postsurgery changes (n = 12) and to conduct predictive analysis (n = 14).Seed-to-voxel analysis revealed changes in magnitude (decreases) and directionality (positively correlated to anticorrelated) of FC pre to post surgery within and between default mode network, salience network, and frontoparietal network nodes [Family-Wise Error (FWE) corrected at P < 0.05]. Baseline FC of the nucleus accumbens (with insula) and hypothalamus (with precentral gyrus) predicted 12-month post-SG % total weight loss (FWE-P < 0.05). Baseline FC of the hippocampus, frontoparietal network, and default mode network nodes predicted improvement in cognitive control of eating behavior 12 months after SG (FWE-P < 0.05).Our findings demonstrate changes in FC magnitude and directionality post versus pre surgery within and between resting-state networks and frontal, paralimbic, and visual areas in SG patients. Baseline FC predicted weight loss and changes in cognitive control of food intake behavior at 12 months. These could serve as predictive biomarkers for bariatric surgery.© 2019 The  Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689005>Association Between Waist Circumference and Dementia in Older Persons: A Nationwide Population-Based Study.</a></h2><p>This study examined whether a positive association exists between waist circumference (WC) and dementia among older persons.The study population comprised 872,082 participants aged 65 years and older who participated in a Korean national health screening examination between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2009.

Yet, regulatory agencies charged with protecting public health continue to conclude that human exposures to these EDCs pose no risk. One reason for the disconnect between the scientific consensus on EDCs in the endocrinology community and the failure to act in the regulatory community is the dependence of the latter on so-called "guideline studies" to evaluate hazards, and the inability to incorporate independent scientific studies in risk assessment. The CLARITY study was intended to bridge this gap, combining a "guideline" study with independent hypothesis-driven studies designed to be more appropriate to evaluate EDCs. Here, we examined an aspect of "guideline" studies, the use of so-called "historical controls", which are essentially control data borrowed from prior studies to aid in the interpretation of current findings. The FDA authors used historical controls to question the plausibility of statistically significant BPA-related effects in the CLARITY study. We examined the use of historical controls on five outcomes in the CLARITY "guideline" study: mammary neoplasms, pituitary neoplasms, kidney nephropathy, prostate inflammation and adenomas, and body weight. Using FDA-proposed historical control data, our evaluation revealed that endpoints used in "guideline" studies are not as reproducible as previously held. Combined with other data comparing the effects of ethinyl estradiol in two "guideline" studies including CLARITY-BPA, we conclude that near exclusive reliance on "guideline" studies can result in scientifically invalid conclusions.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Although it has become one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the Western world, the proportion of NAFLD patients developing these complications is rather small. Therefore, current guidelines recommend noninvasive tests for the initial assessment of NAFLD. Among the available non-invasive tests, transient elastography by FibroScan® (Echosens, Paris, France) is commonly used by hepatologists in Europe and Asia, and the machine has been introduced to the United States in 2013 with rapid adoption. Transient elastography measures liver stiffness and the controlled attenuation parameter simultaneously and can serve as a one-stop examination for both liver steatosis and fibrosis. Liver stiffness measurement also correlates with clinical outcomes and can be used to select patients for varices screening. Although  is a common reason for measurement failures, the development of the XL probe allows successful measurements in the majority of obese patients. This article reviews the performance and limitations of transient elastography in NAFLD and highlights its clinical applications. We also discuss the reliability criteria for transient elastography examination and factors associated with false-positive liver stiffness measurements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696848>Risk of obstructive sleep apnea among senegalese dialysis patients.</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common condition in patients undergoing chronic dialysis and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of OSAS in Senegalese dialysis patients. In a cross-sectional study including 128 patients (75 men and 53 women) dialyzed since ≥6 months in four dialysis units. Data were collected during the dialysis session in the units. OSAS was assessed with the Berlin Questionnaire. Factors associated with OSAS risk were identified by multivariate logistic regression. The mean age of patients was 46.8 ± 16.9 ¥16-85 years).

Here, we addressed the interaction between parasitosis and , and studied how these conditions or the comorbidity affect behavioral and productive parameters in bucks infected with 3000 T. pisiformis eggs. We found that the chronic infection reduced locomotor activity by 28.5% in obese, 18.5% in infected and 47% in obese-infected group (comorbid). The exploratory activity reduced by 42% in obese, 48% in infected and 68% in comorbid rabbits (P ≤ 0.001). Chinning was not affected by , while infection decreased it by 25%. Behavioral reproductive parameters like response time, the mount latency and number of ejaculates were affected by infection and . Furthermore,  seems to increase the parasite load promoting the formation of liver granulomas (16% granulomas compared with normal weight), with a higher number of cysticerci in obese animals (86% more than normal weight).

Whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed after an overnight fast, after a prolonged 48-h fast and after an 8-week weight loss intervention.An 8-week weight loss intervention decreased BOLD signal in areas of the brain involved in salience, sensory motor and executive control. BOLD signal in these areas correlated with leptin levels and body mass index.Weight loss decreased activity in brain areas involved in feeding behaviour and reward processing. These results indicate that these -associated alterations in neuronal activity are related to excessive body weight and might change after weight loss.© 2019 The Authors  Science & Practice published by World  and The  Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd  Science & Practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690632>Hepatic stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 deficiency increases glucose uptake in adipose tissue partially through the PGC-1α-FGF21 axis in mice.</a></h2><p>Increased carbohydrate consumption increases hepatic de novo lipogenesis, which has been linked to the development of chronic metabolic diseases, including , hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. Stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a critical lipogenic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of two monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), oleate and palmitoleate, from the saturated fatty acids, stearate and palmitate, respectively. SCD1-deficient mouse models are protected against diet-induced adiposity, hepatic steatosis, and hyperglycemia. However, the mechanism of this protection by SCD1 deficiency is unclear. Using a liver-specific SCD1 knockout (LKO) mouse model fed a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet (HCD), we show that hepatic SCD1 deficiency increases systemic glucose uptake. Hepatic SCD1 deficiency enhanced glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) expression in the liver and also up-regulated GLUT4 and adiponectin expression in the adipose tissue. The enhanced glucose uptake correlated with increased liver expression and elevated plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a hepatokine known to increase systemic insulin sensitivity and to regulate whole-body lipid metabolism. Feeding LKO mice with triolein-supplemented, but not tristearin-supplemented, HCD reduced FGF21 expression and plasma levels. Consistently, SCD1 inhibition in primary hepatocytes induced FGF21 expression, which was repressed by treatment with oleate but not palmitoleate. Moreover, deletion of the transcriptional coactivator PPARg coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) reduced hepatic and plasma FGF21 and white adipocyte tissue-specific GLUT4 expression and raised plasma glucose levels in the LKO mice. These results suggest that hepatic oleate regulates glucose uptake in adipose tissue either directly or partially by modulating the hepatic PGC-1α-FGF21 axis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686736>Assessment of FTO Gene Polymorphism and its Association with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in North Indian Populations.</a></h2><p>FTO gene polymorphism related to type 2 diabetes and  was studied in this north Indian population.

In this study, we sought to characterize the role of TFEB in adipocyte and adipose tissue physiology and evaluate the therapeutic potential of adipocyte-specific TFEB overexpression in . We demonstrated that mice with adipocyte-specific TFEB overexpression (Adipo-TFEB) were protected from diet-induced , insulin resistance, and metabolic sequelae. Adipo-TFEB mice were lean primarily through increased metabolic rate, suggesting a role for adipose tissue browning and enhanced nonshivering thermogenesis in fat. Transcriptional characterization revealed that TFEB targeted genes involved in adipose tissue browning rather than those involved in autophagy. One such gene encoded PGC-1α, an established target of TFEB that promotes adipocyte browning. To dissect the role of PGC-1α in mediating the downstream effects of TFEB overexpression, we generated mice with adipocyte-specific PGC-1α deficiency and TFEB overexpression. Without PGC-1α, the ability of TFEB overexpression to brown adipose tissue and to elicit beneficial metabolic effects was blunted. Overall, these data implicate TFEB as a PGC-1α-dependent regulator of adipocyte browning and suggest its therapeutic potential in treating metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Metformin, a first-line antidiabetic drug, functions mainly by improving patients' hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. However, its mechanism of action is still not well understood. We show here that pharmacological metformin concentration increases mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and ATP levels in hepatocytes and a clinically relevant metformin dose increases liver mitochondrial density and complex 1 activity along with improved hyperglycemia in high-fat- diet (HFD)-fed mice. Metformin, functioning through 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), promotes mitochondrial fission to improve mitochondrial respiration and restore the mitochondrial life cycle. Furthermore, HFD-fed-mice with liver-specific knockout of AMPKα1/2 subunits exhibit higher blood glucose levels when treated with metformin. Our results demonstrate that activation of AMPK by metformin improves mitochondrial respiration and hyperglycemia in . We also found that supra-pharmacological metformin concentrations reduce adenine nucleotides, resulting in the halt of mitochondrial respiration.

Participants were divided into 2 groups: nonobese (BMI <30 kg/m) and obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m) for comparison.Preoperatively, obese women scored lower than nonobese women in terms of BREAST-Q scores. Mean prereconstruction scores were 51.62 versus 57.10 (psychosocial), 40.18 versus 48.14 (satisfaction with breasts), and 34.30 versus 40.72 (sexual well-being) (all P < 0.05), and 68.48 versus 72.15 (physical well-being) (P = 0.08). At 12 months post-mound reconstruction, there was a significant improvement in scores in both groups. Additionally, there were no significant differences for BREAST-Q scores between the 2 groups 12 months after surgery. While there was a significantly higher minor complication rate in the obese group compared with the nonobese group, there was no significant difference in the rate of major complications (eg, requiring revision surgery) between the 2 groups.Obese participants gain a similar, if not better, improvement in quality of life after breast reconstruction, despite a higher rate of minor complications.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the programming effects of maternal  during preconception and the preconception/gestational period on adiposity and adipose tissue inflammation in offspring using an animal model. Adult female C57Bl/6J mice were assigned either normal diet, high fat diet (HFD) prior to pregnancy, or HFD prior to and through pregnancy. Some offspring were maintained on normal diet while others started HFD later in life. Offspring were assessed for body composition and metabolic responses. Lipid storing tissues were evaluated for expansion and inflammation. Male offspring from the preconception group had the greatest weight gain, most subcutaneous adipose tissue, and largest liver mass when introduced to postnatal HFD. Male offspring of the preconception/gestation group had worsened glucose tolerance and an increase in resident (CD11c) adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) when exposed to postnatal HFD.

The sample of this study was composed of 2.000 students from 20 secondary schools in Istanbul, Turkey. The physical activity levels were also examined using the survey, food consumption levels were determined by applying the 24-h Dietary Recall. The height and weight were measured and evaluated by World Health Organization (WHO) growth references. Among the male students (n = 888), 50.9% were normal weighted, 25.8% were overweight, 19.2% were obese, and 2.2% were severely obese. The percentage of those who were normal weight was higher (65.5%) among the female adolescents (n = 852), and 21.8% of the females were overweight, 10.2% were obese, and 0.9% were severely obese. The differences in terms of intake values of all food items were found to be statistically significant ( < .05). There was no statistically significant difference in the food consumption of male and female adolescents in terms of the level of intake of macronutrients. Children and adolescents need to be provided an adequate, balanced nutrition and physical activity to help them grow and develop healthily.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696650>Total and trimester-specific gestational weight gain and infant anthropometric outcomes at birth and 6 months in low-income Hispanic families.</a></h2><p>To describe total and trimester-specific gestational weight gain (GWG) among low-income Hispanic women and determine whether these GWG exposures are associated with infant anthropometric outcomes at birth and 6 months.Data were from 448 mother-infant pairs enrolled in the Starting Early child  prevention trial. Prenatal weights were used to calculate total GWG and 2 and 3 trimester GWG rates (kg/week) and categorized as inadequate, adequate, and excessive according to the 2009 Institute of Medicine recommendations. Multivariable linear and modified Poisson regressions estimated associations of infant anthropometric outcomes (birthweight, small-for-gestational age [SGA], large-for-gestational age [LGA], rapid weight gain, and weight-for-age, length-for-age, and weight-for-length z-scores at 6 months) with GWG categories.For total GWG, 39% and 27% of women had inadequate and excessive GWG, respectively. 57% and 46% had excessive GWG rates in the 2 and 3 trimesters, respectively, with 29% having excessive rates in both trimesters. Inadequate total GWG was associated with lower infant weight and length outcomes (ß range for z-scores = -0.21 to -0.46, p < 0.05) and lower risk of LGA (adjusted Relative Risk, aRR = 0.38; 95% confidence intervals, CI: 0.16, 0.95) and rapid weight gain (aRR = 0.72; 95%CI: 0.51, 1.00).

Studies conducted in areas with low PM2.5 concentration have found relationship between gestational PM2.5 exposure and birth weight. However, the impact of air pollution on macrosomia has not been studied, especially in highly polluted areas.To evaluate the association between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure during pregnancy and the risk of macrosomia.Data from preconception health examination and prenatal and postnatal records were collected from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012 in the National Free Preconception Health Examination Project. Monthly mean of PM2.5 concentration during pregnancy was estimated from satellite data using an ensemble machine learning model. A newborn with birth weight above 4000 g was defined as macrosomia. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between maternal exposure to PM2.5 and the risk of macrosomia, after adjusting for maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, parity, neonatal sex, duration of gestation, seasonality, educational level, smoking and drinking habits, past history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and family history of diabetes mellitus. Restricted cubic spline models were used to evaluate the dose-response relationship between the risk of macrosomia and PM2.5 concentration.Of 177 841 singleton nonlow birth weight newborns included, 14 598 (8.2%) had macrosomia. The mean PM2.5 concentrations were 70.7, 71.5, and 80.9 μg/m in the first, second, and third trimesters.

The aim of this study was to review the available evidence regarding the management of patients with achalasia after a RYGB. Intra-sphincteric injection of botulinum toxin and pneumatic dilatation can be used to eliminate the functional obstruction at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. However, considering that achalasia patients after RYGB are often young and these treatment modalities have shown worse long-term outcomes, endoscopic or surgical myotomy is preferred. Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a very effective first line of treatment, and as RYGB is an excellent anti-reflux operation per se, post-POEM reflux may not be an issue in these patients. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) is also an effective and safe therapy in achalasia patients with RYGB anatomy, and the gastric remnant can be safely used to perform a fundoplication to cover the myotomy. LHM and POEM are both acceptable primary treatment modalities in this setting.

Recently, energy metabolism in adipose tissue has been the subject of renewed interest, because significant energy expenditure can be induced in cells derived from white adipose tissue progenitors, in addition to brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here we evaluated whether aging-associated change in various adipose tissue depots affects the progression of NAFLD.Six-week-old male C57BL/6NCrSlc mice were fed control chow (C) or high-fat diet (60% fat; HF) for 12 or 24 weeks (12w/C, 12w/HF, 24w/C and 24w/HF groups, respectively) or switched from C to HF diet at 18 weeks of age (24w/C/HF group) and fed for a further 24 weeks. Some 24w/HF mice received a subcutaneous transplantation of adipose progenitors (10 cells/mouse) from young donor mice. Basal energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and liver and adipose tissue histology were then evaluated. In addition, features of senescence and the capacity of adipose progenitors to "brown" were compared in mice of various ages.12w/HF mice demonstrated compensation in the forms of hypertrophy of interscapular classical BAT and the appearance of subcutaneous beige adipocytes, consistent with improved metabolic homeostasis. In contrast, 24w/HF and 24w/C/HF mice developed , glucose intolerance, and severe NAFLD, with accelerated senescence and loss of adipose progenitors in subcutaneous fat tissues. Recruitment of adipose progenitors ameliorated these findings in 24w/HF mice.Impaired metabolic compensation in adipose tissue resulted in the progression of NAFLD, which was associated with aging-related deterioration in adipose progenitors. A new approach targeting adipose tissue progenitors might represent a potential strategy for the prevention of NAFLD.© 2019 Taketani et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687173>Prevalence of overweight and  among African primary school learners: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>The increasing trend in the global prevalence of childhood overweight and  presents a major public health challenge.

Interactions were determined by computing Spearman rank correlations, thresholded at  < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons.Participants with high BMI demonstrate an association between ELA and food addiction, with reward regions playing a role in this interaction. Among women with high BMI, increased ELA was associated with increased centrality of reward and emotion regulation regions. Men with high BMI showed associations between ELA and food addiction with somatosensory regions playing a role in this interaction.The findings suggest that ELA may alter brain networks, leading to increased vulnerability for food addiction and  later in life.

In addition,  and OSAS can cause elevation of the adipose-derived hormone leptin, which increases metabolism. We hypothesized that  along with sleep apnea and leptin independently enhance morphine pharmacokinetics.Children 5-12 years of age who were presenting for surgery were administered a morphine dose of 0.05 mg/kg. Blood was collected at baseline and at subsequent preset times for pharmacokinetic analysis of morphine and its metabolites. Three groups were studied: a nonobese group with severe OSAS, an obese group with severe OSAS, and a control group.Thirty-four patients consisting of controls (n = 16), nonobese/OSAS (n = 8), and obese/OSAS (n = 10) underwent analysis. The obese/OSAS group had a higher dose-adjusted mean maximum morphine concentration (CMAX) over 540 minutes compared to the controls (P < .001) and those with only OSAS (P = .014). The obese/OSAS group also had lower volume of distribution (Vd) when compared to OSAS-only patients (P = .007). In addition, those in the obese/OSAS group had a higher morphine 3-glucuronide (M3G) maximum concentration (P = .012) and a higher ratio of M3G to morphine than did the control group (P = .011). Time to maximum morphine 6-glucuronide (M6G) concentration was significantly lower in both nonobese/OSAS and obese/OSAS groups than in the control group (P < .005). C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-10, and leptin were all higher in the obese/OSAS group than in controls (P = .004, 0.026, and <0.001, respectively), and compared to OSAS-only patients, CRP (P = .013) and leptin (P = .002) levels were higher in the obese/OSAS group.The combination of  and OSAS was associated with an increase in morphine metabolism compared with that in normal-weight controls.

BCAA supplementation has been recommended in elderly and athletes, but recent studies suggest an association between high dietary BCAAs and blood levels of BCAAs with greater risk of cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). This review aims to integrate current epidemiological evidence analyzing the association between BCAAs and related-CMD risk factors.Most epidemiological studies consistently show that dietary BCAAs are associated with higher risk of type-2 diabetes (T2D) whereas there is limited evidence related with other cardiovascular risk factors. Evidence also exists showing an association between higher circulating BCAA levels and risk of T2D and cardiovascular disease, and also probably with metabolic syndrome and overweight/. Several clinical trials suggest beneficial cardiometabolic effect of BCAAs supplementation, although with a small sample size and short follow-up. Studies show a weak correlation between dietary BCAAs and circulating BCAA levels. Protein quality sources and whole dietary pattern are key aspects to improve our understanding of the effect of BCAAs as well as factors associated with higher protein needs, such as age or frailty.Dietary and circulating BCAAs exhibit possible detrimental cardiometabolic effects, but BCAA supplementation may have some positive influence on target groups with nutritional deficiencies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690802>Bisphenol S and Bisphenol A disrupt morphogenesis of MCF-12A human mammary epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers diagnosed in women worldwide.

This prompted its replacement with other bisphenol analogs such as, bisphenol-S (BPS). In this study we used the human mammary epithelial cells, MCF-12A, grown in extracellular matrix to investigate the ability of BPA and BPS to disrupt mammary epithelial cells organization. We show that both BPA and BPS were equipotent in disrupting the organization of the acinar structures, despite BPS being less oestrogenic by other assays. Further, treatment with both compounds enabled the cells to invade the lumen of the structures.

PRADC1 is dispensable for whole-body metabolism when mice are fed a low-fat diet. However, in  induced by high-fat feeding, PRADC1-deficient female mice have reduced weight gain and adiposity despite similar caloric intake. Decreased fat mass is attributed, in part, to increased metabolic rate, physical activity, and energy expenditure in these animals. Reduced adiposity in PRADC1-deficient mice, however, does not improve systemic glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, liver steatosis, or adipose inflammation. Thus, in PRADC1-deficient animals, decreased fat mass and enhanced physical activity are insufficient to confer a healthy metabolic phenotype in the context of an obesogenic diet.

The objective of the current study was to observe the unique association of IE with physical health indicators in a sample of adults, independent of objective weight status.Participants were 248 adults (32 ± 14 years old, 73% female, 64% White) of all weight categories (18.2-55.3 kg m), with an average body mass index (BMI) of 30 ± 8 kg m. IE was measured with the Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2). BMI was objectively measured in-lab. Health indicators included blood pressure (BP) and fasting glucose.A series of hierarchical linear regressions revealed no significant associations between IE and systolic BP ( = -0.076,  = 0.256), diastolic BP (DBP;  = -0.122,  = 0.073) or fasting glucose ( = 0.047,  = 0.500) after controlling for BMI. All effects sizes were small or below (  = 0.00 to -0.04). Sensitivity analyses revealed significantly lower DBP in high intuitive eaters versus low when analysed with a -test, (111.651) = 3.602,  < 0.001, Levene corrected; however, after controlling for relevant covariates (i.e. BMI and demographics), analysis of covariance revealed no difference in DBP between groups, (1, 116) = 0.330,  = 0.567.

At baseline, diet was assessed with a 110-item food-frequency questionnaire. The Lifelines Diet Score, based on international evidence for diet-disease relations at the food group level, was calculated to assess diet quality. For analyses, the score was divided in quintiles (Qs). Body weight was objectively measured at baseline and after a median follow-up of 44 mo (25th-75th percentile: 35-51 mo). In between, body weight was self-reported twice. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the association between diet quality and weight change by sex and in 6 age categories (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and ≥70 y).Mean 4-y weight change decreased over age categories. Confounder-adjusted linear mixed models showed that the association between diet quality and weight change was modified by sex (P-interaction = 0.001). In women, the association was also modified by age (P-interaction = 0.001). Poor diet quality was most strongly associated with weight gain in the youngest men [Q1 compared with Q5: +0.33 kg/y (95% CI: 0.10, 0.56)] and women [+0.22 kg/y (95% CI: 0.07, 0.37)]. In contrast, in women aged ≥70 y, poor diet quality was associated with greater weight loss [-0.44 kg/y (95% CI: -0.84, -0.05)].Poor diet quality was related to higher weight gain, especially in young adults.

Participants underwent evaluations that included the following variables: i) immunometabolic markers, ii) healthcare costs, iii) , iv) habitual physical activity, and v) history of personal illness. Statistical significance was set at values lower than 5% and the software used was BioEstat.The correlation between metabolic and inflammatory markers and healthcare costs demonstrated a positive and significant relationship, adjusted for  and HPA, between glucose concentrations and exam costs (r = 0.343, p-value = 0.007) and total cost (r = 261; p-value = 0.043); HOMA index and cost of exams (r = 0.267; p-value = 0.038); and IL-10 and cost of medical consultation (r = 0.297; p-value = 0.020).Metabolic and inflammatory markers may be related to the costs of consultations and examinations, independent of  and HPA.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689003>Early-life determinants of excess weight in children born heavy.</a></h2><p>Infants born heavy are vulnerable to later , but it is unknown whether -related risk factors present between conception and delivery predict their postnatal weight trajectory. We modelled the weight trajectories of infants born high birth weight (HBW, greater than or equal to 4000 g) and/or large for gestational age (LGA, greater than 90th percentile) using data from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II (N = 371). A high percentage of infants were both HBW and LGA, but the trajectories were modelled separately. Weight of infants born heavy begins high, gradually decreases, and then levels off by 12 months. Delivery method was the only predictor of weight. Caesarean-delivered HBW infants were heavier than vaginally-delivered HBW infants although this effect disappeared by 12 months. Findings indicate that early-life influences are not necessarily deterministic of the postnatal weight trajectory of infants born heavy.

In this heterogeneous patient group, there is a lack of clinical tools for predicting mortality and outcome.In order to facilitate the choice of treatment in patients with AHRF we evaluated the protein ST2, an established biomarker for cardiac stress, and its role in predicting mortality in patients with AHRF treated with NPPV. We also examined if ST2 baseline levels and changes during the first 12 hrs of treatment were predictive of treatment outcome.The study population consisted of 46 patients treated with NPPV for AHRF. Background data and clinical parameters were obtained and blood samples taken at various time points during the treatment. During the follow-up period of 18 months, the prognostic value of ST2 with regards to mortality was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard model.Of the 46 patients, there were 3 subgroups in regards to primary diagnosis: Acute Exacerbation of COPD (n=34), Acute Heart Failure (n=8) and Acute Exacerbation in  Hypoventilation Syndrome (n=4). We found that ST2 was an independent predictor of both short-term and long-term mortality during the follow-up period. The Hazard Ratio (HR) per 1-SD increment of ST2 for 28-day mortality was 11.00 (95% CI 1.8-67.2, p 0.009) and for 18-month mortality 2.11 (95% CI 1.4-3.2, p 0.001). The results seem to be driven by the largest subgroup of patients, with Acute Exacerbation of COPD, and deaths within the first 28 days. Furthermore, changes in ST2 values during the first 12 hrs of treatment were not predictive of treatment outcome.Our results show that ST2 is a target to explore further as a predictor of short-term mortality in patients with AHRF treated with NPPV.© 2019 Jónsdóttir et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697967>The glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide signaling axis in the central nervous system.</a></h2><p>Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is an incretin hormone released from the epithelium of the upper small intestine. While GIP shares common actions on the pancreatic beta cell with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), unlike GLP-1, GIP presents a complex target for the development of diabetes and  therapies due to its extra-pancreatic effects on fat mass. Recent pharmacological developments, however, have provided insight into a previously unrecognized role for GIP receptor (GIPR) signaling in regulating appetite. Additionally, GIP-based therapeutics have demonstrated promising neuroprotective properties. Together these observations identify an important central component of the GIP/GIPR signaling axis, and have triggered a resurgence of research interest into the central actions of GIP. In this review, we discuss what is currently known about where GIP may act in the central nervous system (CNS), the characteristics of its target cell populations, and the physiological effects of manipulating the activity Gipr-expressing cells in the brain.Copyright © 2019.

Food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) are useful tools for nutrition policies and public health strategies to promote healthier eating and physical activity. In this paper, we discuss the process followed in developing the dietary guidelines for the Spanish population by the Spanish Society of Community Nutrition (SENC) and further explain the collaboration with primary healthcare practitioners as presented in the context of the NUTRIMAD 2018 international congress of SENC. From a health in all policies approach, SENC convened a group of experts in nutrition and public health to review the evidence on diet-health, nutrient intake and food consumption in the Spanish population, as well as food preparation, determinants and impact of diet on environmental sustainability. The collaborative group drafted the document and designed the graphic icon, which was then subject to a consultation process, discussion, and qualitative evaluation. Next, a collaborative group was established to plan a dissemination strategy, involving delegates from all the primary healthcare scientific societies in Spain.

We studied individuals aged ≥ 18 years old with diabetes risk given by a body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m or a FinnRisc score ≥ 13/20. Participants were randomly assigned to receive: 7 ml sunflower oil (control group), 3.5 ml of the study formulation + 3.5 ml of sunflower oil (low-dose group) or 7 ml of study formulation (high-dose group).We randomized 25 individuals. After one withdrawal in the high-dose group, the study sample comprised nine patients in the control, nine in the low-dose and six in the high-dose groups. The insulin sensitivity increased significantly and in a dose-dependent fashion, up to 10% in the high-dose group. At week 8 the low-dose group exhibited lower glycemic excursions during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), especially 1 h after the glucose challenge (32 mg/dl or 23% lower vs. control group). The incremental area under the glucose curve in the OGTT was 17.1% lower in the low-dose group vs. the control group. Waist circumference increased in the control group, remained constant in the low-dose group and decreased in the high-dose group. C-reactive protein decreased in both formulation groups, up to 50% in the high-dose group. Participants in the formulation groups exhibited increased secretion of GLP-1 and plasma irisin at week 8 vs. the control group.The formulation induced favorable changes in insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, abdominal  and inflammation.

Although recent studies suggested the importance of type 2 immunity in an anti-inflammatory microenvironment in adipose tissue, the regulatory effects of T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines on systemic metabolic regulation are not fully understood. Recently, we identified the roles of the Th2 cytokine (interleukin 4 [IL-4] and IL-13)-induced adipokine, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), in adipose tissue in regulating systemic glucose metabolism via signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) activation. Moreover, we showed that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is required to maintain these macrophage-regulating autocrine and paracrine signaling pathways via Th2 cytokine-induced secretion of GDF15. In this review, we discuss how the type 2 immune response and Th2 cytokines regulate metabolism in adipose tissue. Specifically, we review the systemic regulatory roles of Th2 cytokines in metabolic disease and the role of mitochondria in maintenance of type 2 responses in adipose tissue homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 Korean Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685967>Association between dietary calcium intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease among Korean adults.</a></h2><p>Although dietary calcium intake is associated with a risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), it has not been studied extensively in Asian populations.

Nutrient intake, including dietary calcium, was estimated using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. CVD included myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and stroke per the World Health Organization criteria. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).In the fully adjusted model, HRs of CVD across increasing quintiles of dietary calcium intake were 1.0 (reference), 0.85 (95% CI: 0.66-1.10), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.58-1.02), 0.59 (95% CI: 0.42-0.83), and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.48-1.08); a significant linear trend was detected (p for trend = 0.04).

In this study, the relationship of body mass index (BMI) and circulating leptin levels with CBC among obese and overweight adults was examined.  CBC and biochemical parameters, WBC and hematological profiles, leptin levels, related factors to liver, and kidney and lipid profiles were measured among 184 obese and overweight people aged 18-60 years. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. To assess the normality of data, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. Logarithmic transformation was performed for some variables with non-normal distribution. The association between 2 quantitative variables was measured using bivariate correlation (Pearson or Spearman). Pearson correlations and multiple regression analysis were performed to assess the correlation between variables. Simple and multiple regression analyses were performed to predict some variables. P- value <0.05 was considered significant.  Hematocrit, insulin, fasting blood sugar, uric acid, TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C, and ALT were positively correlated with BMI (p=0.041, r=0.149 for hematocrit; p≤0.001, r=0.520 for insulin; p≤0.001, r=0.363 for FBS; p≤0.001, r=0.309 for uric acid; p=0.015, r=0.189 for TG; p=0.030, r=161 for LDL-C; p=0.019, r=0.181 for VLDL-C; p≤0.001, r=0.299 for ALT), whereas urea and HDL-C were negatively correlated with BMI (p≤0.001, r=-0.368 for urea; p≤0.001, r=-0.297 for HDL-C). Moreover, LDL-C and insulin were positively correlated with leptin (P = 0.011, r = 0.194 for LDL-C, P = 0.013, r = 0.114 for insulin) and hematocrit, urea, creatinine, TG and VLDL-C were negatively correlated with leptin (p=0.040, r=-0.162 for hematocrit; p≤0.001, r=-0.305 for urea; p=0.007, r=-0.219 for creatinine; p=0.025, r=0.188 for TG; p=0.007, r=-0.218 for VLDL-C). Our analysis showed that white blood cell was positively correlated with leptin (β=17.36, p=0.048). Also, other CBC parameters had no significant correlations with BMI and leptin.  According to the findings of this study, BMI had a negative association with urea and HDL-C, while BMI had a positive association with insulin, hematocrit, FBS, uric acid, TG, VLDL-C, LDL-C, and ALT.

This diabesity epidemic is increasingly impacting children and adolescents, and there is scarce evidence of interventions with favourable long-term outcomes.In order to understand the determinants of diabesity and how to address them, multiple stakeholders were invited to a meeting to discuss current state of knowledge and to help design a program to prevent pediatric and adolescent diabesity.The meeting was held at McMaster University on March 4th, 2015. The event involved presentations to deliver state-of-the-art knowledge about diabesity, and roundtable discussions of several domains including nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and mental health. Discussion transcripts were analyzed using NVivo.Forty-nine participants took part in the workshop. They included clinical healthcare professionals, public health, Aboriginal Patient Navigator, research scientists, students, and patients with family members. A total of 628 reference counts from the roundtable discussions were coded under 20 emerging themes. Participants believed that the most important elements of the program involve the provision of knowledge and education, family involvement, patient motivation, location of program delivery, and use of surveys and questionnaires for outcome measurement.Effective pediatric and adolescent diabesity prevention programs should be conceptualized by multidisciplinary stakeholders and embrace the complexity of diabesity with multiprong interventions.

This study examined the association between n-3 PUFA status and cognitive function in young Australian women.This was a secondary outcome analysis of a cross-sectional study that recruited 300 healthy women (18-35 y) of normal weight (NW: BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m) or obese weight (OB: BMI ≥30.0 kg/m). Participants completed a computer-based cognition testing battery (IntegNeuro™) evaluating the domains of impulsivity, attention, information processing, memory and executive function. The Omega-3 Index (O3I) was used to determine n-3 PUFA status (percentage of EPA (20:5n-3) plus DHA (22:6n3) in the red cell membrane) and the participants were divided into O3I tertile groups: T1 < 5.47%, T2 = 5.47-6.75%, T3 > 6.75%. Potential confounding factors of BMI, inflammatory status (C-reactive Protein), physical activity (total MET-min/wk), alpha1-acid glycoprotein, serum ferritin and hemoglobin, were assessed. Data reported as z-scores (mean ± SD), analyses via ANOVA and ANCOVA.Two hundred ninety-nine women (26.9 ± 5.4 y) completed the study (O3I data, n = 288). The ANOVA showed no overall group differences but a significant group × cognition domain interaction (p < 0.01). Post hoc tests showed that participants in the low O3I tertile group scored significantly lower on attention than the middle group (p = 0.01; ES = 0.45 [0.15-0.74]), while the difference with the high group was borderline significant (p = 0.052; ES = 0.38 [0.09-0.68]). After confounder adjustments, the low group had lower attention scores than both the middle (p = 0.01) and high (p = 0.048) groups. These findings were supported by univariate analyses which found significant group differences for the attention domain only (p = 0.004).Cognitive function in the attention domain was lower in women with lower O3I, but still within normal range. This reduced but normal level of cognition potentially provides a lower baseline from which cognition would decline with age.

To clarify the link between alcohol use and cardiometabolic health, this systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42016039308A) uses PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to synthesize how alcohol use affects dietary intake (carbohydrate, fat and protein intake) in humans. A search of Google Scholar, PsycINFO and PubMed from June 2016-March 2019 yielded 30 qualified studies. Experimental and observational studies allowed for inferences about effects of a single drinking occasion and of frequent drinking, respectively. Alcohol quantities were standardized according to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. On average, methodological quality of the studies was medium strength. Results indicated that a single occasion of light and moderate drinking as well as frequent light and moderate drinking were linked to greater fat and protein intake, albeit the majority of studies did not detect differences in dietary intake due to these drinking behaviours. Frequent heavy drinking, on the other hand, was linked to less carbohydrate intake in the majority of studies. Overall, alcohol use does not appear to uniformly affect diet but instead appears to affect intake of specific macronutrients in a dose-dependent manner, most consistently decreasing carbohydrate intake with heavier use.© 2019 World  Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695624>Acetaldehyde Induces an Endothelium-Dependent Relaxation of Superior Mesenteric Artery: Potential Role in Postprandial Hyperemia.</a></h2><p>Acetaldehyde (AA) is a small, ubiquitous compound present in foods, beverages, as a gas phase combustion product, and also endogenously generated from metabolism as from ethanol (EtOH). Acetate is a short chain fatty acid derived from AA oxidation, and acetate levels were significantly higher in urine collected overnight with food provided  compared with urine collected after 9 h fasting. Feeding increases gastrointestinal blood flow, and thus, we explored the direct effects of AA (and acetate) in isolated murine superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Over the concentration range of 1-100 mM, AA strongly, and reversibly relaxed agonist-induced contractions of SMA including phenylephrine (PE), thromboxane A analog (U46,619) and high potassium (High K) without toxicity. The sensitivity (EC) but not the efficacy (>90% relaxation of PE-precontraction) of AA-induced relaxations was dependent on blood vessel (SMA was 3× more sensitive than aorta) and contractile agonist (PE EC = 3.3 ± 0.4 mM; U46,619 EC = 14.9 ± 1.5 mM; and High K EC = 17.7 ± 0.5 mM) yet independent of circadian cycle and sex. The most sensitive component of the AA-induced relaxation was inhibited significantly by: (1) a mechanically impaired endothelium; (2) nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor (L-NAME); and (3) a guanylyl cyclase (GC) inhibitor (ODQ). Both acetate and EtOH stimulated much weaker relaxations in SMA than did AA, yet these relaxations were significantly inhibited by L-NAME as well. Neither EtOH nor acetate relaxed pre-contracted aorta. Although neither cyanamide, a non-specific aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme inhibitor, nor Alda-1, a specific activator of ALDH2 activity, had any effect on either sensitivity or efficacy of AA-induced relaxation in SMA, cyanamide significantly blocked both EtOH- and acetate-induced relaxations in SMA implicating a role of ALDH activity in vasorelaxation. These data show that AA relaxes SMA via an endothelium- and NO-dependent mechanism indicating that AA may be one component of the complex post-prandial hyperemia reflex via vasodilatation of mesenteric vasculature.Copyright © 2019 Jin, Lorkiewicz, Malovichko, Bhatnagar, Srivastava and Conklin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686880>Genistein diet improves body weight, serum glucose and triglyceride levels in both male and female ob/ob mice.</a></h2><p>Diabetic  in the leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse is associated with weight gain, and hyperglycemia, along with hyperinsulinemia.

Recent literature has shown that EVs are produced by cells within metabolic tissues, such as adipose tissue, pancreas, muscle and liver. These vesicles have therefore been proposed as a novel intercellular communication mode in systemic metabolic regulation. In this review, we will describe and discuss the current literature that investigates the role of adipose-derived EVs in the regulation of -associated metabolic disease. We will particularly focus on the EV-dependent communication between adipocytes, the vasculature and immune cells in type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691468>Dietary alpha-ketoglutarate promotes beige adipogenesis and prevents  in middle-aged mice.</a></h2><p>Aging usually involves the progressive development of certain illnesses, including diabetes and . Due to incapacity to form new white adipocytes, adipose expansion in aged mice primarily depends on adipocyte hypertrophy, which induces metabolic dysfunction. On the other hand, brown adipose tissue burns fatty acids, preventing ectopic lipid accumulation and metabolic diseases. However, the capacity of brown/beige adipogenesis declines inevitably during the aging process. Previously, we reported that DNA demethylation in the Prdm16 promoter is required for beige adipogenesis. DNA methylation is mediated by ten-eleven family proteins (TET) using alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) as a cofactor. Here, we demonstrated that the circulatory AKG concentration was reduced in middle-aged mice (10-month-old) compared with young mice (2-month-old). Through AKG administration replenishing the AKG pool, aged mice were associated with the lower body weight gain and fat mass, and improved glucose tolerance after challenged with high-fat diet (HFD). These metabolic changes are accompanied by increased expression of brown adipose genes and proteins in inguinal adipose tissue. Cold-induced brown/beige adipogenesis was impeded in HFD mice, whereas AKG rescued the impairment of beige adipocyte functionality in middle-aged mice. Besides, AKG administration up-regulated Prdm16 expression, which was correlated with an increase of DNA demethylation in the Prdm16 promoter. In summary, AKG supplementation promotes beige adipogenesis and alleviates HFD-induced  in middle-aged mice, which is associated with enhanced DNA demethylation of the Prdm16 gene.© 2019 The Authors.

One of the mechanisms in which diet can reduce the risk of disease is with regard to its impact on telomeres. Telomere length (TL) is highly correlated to chronological age and metabolic status. Individuals with shorter telomeres are at higher risk of chronic diseases and mortality. Diet may influence TL by several mechanisms such as regulating oxidative stress and inflammation or modulating epigenetic reactions. The present systematic review aims to examine the results from epidemiologic and clinical trials conducted in humans evaluating the role of nutrients, food groups, and dietary patterns on TL. We also discuss the possible mechanisms of action that influence this process, with the perspective that TL could be a novel biomarker indicating the risk of metabolic disturbances and age-related diseases. The available evidence suggests that some antioxidant nutrients, the consumption of fruits and vegetables, and Mediterranean diet are mainly associated with longer telomeres. However, most of the evidence is based on high heterogenic observational studies and very few randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Therefore, the associations summarized in the present review need to be confirmed with larger prospective cohort studies and better-designed RCTs.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687020>Causes and Metabolic Consequences of Gynecomastia in Adult Patients.</a></h2><p>Gynecomastia (GM) is a benign enlargement of male breast due to glandular tissue proliferation. GM is a symptom of systemic or local hormonal disturbances, which could be associated with functional changes or pathological conditions. However, the long-lasting steroid imbalance in men with GM might exert negative influence on their metabolic health.A total of 110 adult men with symptomatic GM were included in the present retrospective cross-sectional study. Anthropometric, metabolic, and hormonal data of the patients were collected.In almost 64% of GM patients, the underlying pathological condition was identified. Moreover, the development of GM was among the primary symptoms leading to the proper diagnosis in more than 40% of hypogonadal patients. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) was 53%; the highest prevalence of MS was found in patients with medication-induced GM and in the hypogonadal patients, whereas the lowest prevalence was observed in men with idiopathic postpubertal GM despite the similar degree of . The lower testosterone levels were associated with more unfavorable lipid profile in the GM patients.The development of GM in adults might be an important symptom of an underlying gonadal disease. Moreover, it could be associated with an increased risk of metabolic disturbances. Our results support the need of detailed laboratory and hormonal investigations in patients with GM including targeted screening for metabolic disturbances. Further longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the long-term consequences of sex hormones imbalance on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adults with GM.Copyright © 2019 Ralitsa Robeva et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686316>CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) knockdown reduces inflammation, ER stress, and apoptosis, and promotes autophagy in oxLDL-treated RAW264.7 macrophage cells.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis is associated with deregulated cholesterol metabolism and formation of macrophage foam cells. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) is a transcription factor, and its inhibition has recently been shown to prevent atherosclerosis development and foam cell formation. However, whether C/EBPβ regulates inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and apoptosis, in macrophage foam cells and its underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of C/EBPβ knockdown on proteins and genes implicated in inflammation, ER stress, apoptosis, and autophagy in macrophage foam cells. RAW264.7 macrophage cells were transfected with control and C/EBPβ-siRNA and then treated with nLDL and oxLDL. Key proteins and genes involved in inflammation, ER stress, apoptosis, and autophagy were analyzed by western blot and qPCR. We found that short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of C/EBPβ attenuated atherogenic lipid-mediated induction of proteins and genes implicated in inflammation (P-NFkB-p65, NFkB-p65, and TNFα), ER stress (ATF4 and ATF6), and apoptosis (CHOP, caspase 1, 3, and 12). Interestingly, C/EBPβ knockdown upregulated the expression of autophagy proteins (LC3A/B-II, ATG5) and genes (LC3B, ATG5) but decreased the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein phosphorylation and mTORC1 gene expression in oxLDL-loaded RAW264.7 macrophage cells. More importantly, treatment with rapamycin (inhibitor of mTOR) increased expression of proteins implicated in autophagy and cholesterol efflux in oxLDL-loaded RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. The present results suggest that C/EBPβ inactivation regulates macrophage foam cell formation in atherogenesis by reducing inflammation, ER stress, and apoptosis and by promoting autophagy and inactivating mTOR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695236>El receptor soluble de insulina y el síndrome metabólico.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome describes a group of signs that increase the likelihood for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and some types of cancer. The action of insulin depends on its binding to membrane receptors on its target cells. We wonder if blood insulin could travel bound to proteins and if, in the presence of hyperinsulinemia, a soluble insulin receptor might be generated. We used young adult Wistar rats (which have no predisposition to  or diabetes), whose drinking water was added 20 % of sugar and that were fed a standard diet ad libitum for two and six months. They were compared with control rats under the same conditions, but that had running water for consumption. At two months, the rats developed central , moderate hypertension, high triglyceride levels, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, i.e. metabolic syndrome. Electrophoresis of the rats' plasma proteins was performed, followed by Western Blot (WB) for insulin and for the outer portion of the insulin receptor. The bands corresponding to insulin and to the receptor external part were at the same molecular weight level, 25-fold higher than that of free insulin. We demonstrated that insulin, both in control animals and in those with hyperinsulinemia, travels bound to the receptor outer portion (ectodomain), which we called soluble insulin receptor, and that is released al higher amounts in response to plasma insulin increase; in rats with metabolic syndrome and hyperinsulinemia, plasma levels are much higher than in controls. Soluble insulin receptor increase in blood might be an early sign of metabolic syndrome.Copyright: © 2019 Permanyer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687168>Understanding low adherence to an exercise program for adolescents with : the HEARTY trial.</a></h2><p>Despite efforts to improve adherence to physical activity interventions in youth with , low adherence and attrition remain areas of great concern.The study was designed to determine which physiological and/or psychological factors predicted low adherence in adolescents with  enrolled in a 6-month exercise intervention study aimed to improve body composition.Three hundred four adolescents with  aged 14-18 years who volunteered for the HEARTY (Healthy Eating Aerobic and Resistance Training in Youth) randomized controlled trial completed physiological (body mass index, waist circumference, per cent body fat, resting metabolic rate and aerobic fitness) and psychological (body image, mood, self-esteem and self-efficacy) measures.One hundred forty-one out of 228 (62%) randomized to exercise groups had low adherence (completed <70% of the prescribed four exercise sessions per week) to the intervention protocol. Logistic regression revealed that there were no baseline demographic or physiological variables that predicted low adherence in the participants.

Since there are sex differences in the development of  and susceptibility to -related disorders, we sought to determine the role of estrogens in regulating the circadian mechanisms underlying diet-induced . When fed high-fat diet, C57BL/6J male mice gain weight while females are resistant to diet-induced .

We found that ovariectomized females with undetectable circulating estrogens became obese and had disrupted daily rhythms of eating behavior and locomotor activity when fed high-fat diet. The phase of the liver molecular circadian rhythm was also altered by high-fat diet feeding in ovariectomized mice. Estradiol replacement in ovariectomized females fed high-fat diet rescued these behavioral and tissue rhythms. Additionally, restoring the daily rhythm of eating behavior in ovariectomized females with time-restricted feeding inhibited diet-induced  and insulin resistance. Together, these data suggest that the circadian system is a target for treating  and its comorbidities in women after menopause, when circulating levels of estrogens are too low to protect their circadian rhythms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694316>Eighth Annual Conference of inVIVO Planetary Health: From Challenges to Opportunities.</a></h2><p>inVIVO Planetary Health (inVIVO) is a progressive scientific movement providing evidence, advocacy, and inspiration to align the interests and vitality of people, place, and planet.

Group-based trajectory modelling was used to identify latent BMI trajectory groups. Logistic regression was used to assess independent associations adjusted for covariates.Three distinct BMI trajectory groups were identified: Group 1 (59% of the cohort) had stable low BMI, Group 2 (35% of the cohort) had stable median BMI, and Group 3 (6% of the cohort) had high and increasing BMI over time. Relative to Groups 1 and 2 combined, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) of being in Group 3 associated with maternal exposures were 5.6 (5.1-6.2) for prepregnancy , 2.4 (2.2-2.7) for prepregnancy overweight, 2.1 (1.2-3.7) for T1D, 1.6 (1.4-1.8) for T2D, 1.4 (1.3-1.6) for GDM requiring medication treatment, 1.1 (1.0-1.3) for GDM not requiring medication, 1.3 (1.2-1.4) for EGWG, and 1.2 (1.2-1.3) for breastfeeding ≤ 6 months.Child's high and increasing BMI trajectory was strongly associated with maternal prepregnancy  and overweight, modestly associated with maternal T1D, T2D, and GDM requiring medication treatment and EGWG, and slightly associated with breastfeeding ≤ 6 months.

Participants were staged from 0 to 3 (absent to severe health risk) according to EOSS-P. Associations were assessed using age-adjusted and sex-adjusted general linear models.Quality of life decreased with increasing EOSS-P stages ( < 0.001). QOL was 75.7 ± 11.4 in stage 0/1, 69.1 ± 13.1 in stage 2 and 55.4 ± 13.0 in stage 3.

Regardless of sexual orientation, WBI was associated with poorer mental HRQOL, lower eating self-efficacy, and increased eating to cope, controlling for demographics and BMI.Experiencing weight stigma is as common for SM adults as heterosexual adults engaged in weight management, and WBI is associated with maladaptive eating behaviors and poor mental HRQOL. Increased attention to weight stigma and its health implications in SM populations is warranted.© 2019 The  Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696128>Hypoxia Suppresses High Fat Diet-Induced Steatosis And Development Of Hepatic Adenomas.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the most common form of silent liver disease in the United States and  is associated with increased risk of NAFLD. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which is common in obese individuals is associated with a greater incidence of NAFLD, which in turn, increases the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is unclear how , OSA and NAFLD interrelate nor how they collectively contribute to an increased risk for developing HCC.Male BALB/c mice were exposed to diethylnitrosamine and phenobarbital followed by 48 weeks of either standard chow diet (chow), chow with hypoxia, high-fat diet, or a combination of hypoxia and high-fat diet. We noninvasively monitored tumor development using micro-CT imaging. We tracked the total weight gained throughout the study. We evaluated liver histology, fat accumulation, carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) expression, as well as, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).A high-fat diet without hypoxia led to the development of  that induced hepatic steatosis and promoted tumorigenesis. Animals on a high-fat diet and that were also exposed to hypoxia had lower total weight gain, lower steatosis, lower serum AST and ALT levels, and fewer number of hepatic adenomas than a high-fat diet without hypoxia.These findings suggest that hypoxia abrogates , hepatic steatosis, and hepatic tumorigenesis related to a high-fat diet.© 2019 Sweeney et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688510>Benefits of Cardiac Rehabilitation in Coronary Artery Disease: DOES WEIGHT MATTER?</a></h2><p>To evaluate the response of patients with  to a cardiac rehabilitation program (CRP), compared with patients without .We performed a retrospective analysis of 731 patients who completed phase II of a CRP after an acute coronary syndrome.

The purpose of this study was to compare 30-day perioperative complications in underweight (BMI <18.50 kg/m), normal-weight (BMI 18.50-24.99 kg/m), overweight (BMI 25.00-29.99 kg/m), class I  (BMI 30.00-34.99 kg/m), and morbidly obese (BMI ≥35.00 kg/m) groups.We performed a cohort study including patients who underwent unilateral primary THA by a single surgeon between January 2010 and December 2015 at our institution. We assessed 30-day complications, operation time, operative blood loss, and length of hospital stay.We identified 1565 primary THAs that were performed in patients with varying BMI levels. Compared with the normal-weight patients, the morbidly obese group had a higher 30-day complication rate (8.9% vs. 2.4%), longer operative time (79 minutes vs. 70 minutes), and more blood loss (376 mL vs. 302 mL). Underweight patients did not present any 30-day complications, and there were no differences among underweight and normal-weight patients regarding complication rates, operative time, or blood loss. The mean length of hospital stay was comparable among the different BMI groups. In the multivariate regression model, higher BMI was not associated with a higher risk of 30-day complications. Independent risk factors for 30-day complications were advanced age, prolonged operative time, and cardiovascular comorbidities.Although increased operative time, blood loss, and perioperative complications were seen in the morbidly obese patients, BMI alone was not an independent risk factor for a higher 30-day complication rate. Therefore, our data suggest clinicians should make elderly patients aware of increased 30-day complications before the procedure, particularly those with cardiovascular comorbidities. Withholding THA solely on the basis of BMI is not justified.Copyright © 2019 Chun-Yu Hung et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691531>Changes in health-related quality of life with intensive behavioural therapy combined with liraglutide 3.0 mg per day.</a></h2><p>This study examined the effects of intensive behavioural therapy (IBT) for  (IBT-alone), IBT plus liraglutide 3.0 mg/day (IBT-liraglutide), and IBT-liraglutide combined with 12 weeks of a portion-controlled diet (Multicomponent) on changes in general health-related (HR) quality of life (QoL) and weight-related QoL. Adults with  (79.3% female; 54.0% white; 44.7% black; mean age = 47.6 ± 11.8 years and body mass index = 38.4 ± 4.9 kg/m ) were randomized to IBT-alone (n = 50), IBT-liraglutide (n = 50) or Multicomponent (n = 50). General HRQoL was measured with the Short Form-36 (SF-36), and weight-related QoL was assessed with the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite scale. At week 52, participants in the three groups lost 6.1 ± 1.3%, 11.5 ± 1.3% and 11.8 ± 1.3% of initial body weight, respectively. Both liraglutide-treated groups were significantly more likely than IBT-alone to achieve clinically meaningful improvements in total weight-related QoL. They also both achieved greater improvements than IBT-alone in weight-related public distress and in general mental health, as measured by the SF-36 mental component summary score. Independent of treatment group, greater categorical weight loss was associated with greater improvements in several domains of both general and weight-related QoL.

Each participant underwent whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and 3DO scans; multisite conventional tape measurements served as the anthropometric criterion measure. 3DO body shape was described using automated body circumference, length, and volume measures. 3DO estimates were compared with criterion measures using simple linear regression by the stepwise selection method.Of the 181 participants, 112 were used for the training set, 49 were used for the test set, and 20 were excluded for technical reasons. 3DO body composition estimates were strongly associated with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measures for percent body fat, fat mass, and fat-free mass (R : 0.83, 0.96, and 0.98, respectively). 3DO provided reliable measurements of fat mass (coefficient of variation, 3.30; root mean square error [RMSE], 0.53), fat-free mass (coefficient of variation, 1.34; RMSE, 0.53 kg), and percent body fat (RMSE = 1.2%).3DO surface scanning provides accurate and precise anthropometric and body composition estimates in children and adolescents with high precision. 3DO is a safe, accessible, and practical method for evaluating body shape and composition in research and clinical settings.© 2019 The  Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694716>Association of changes in commute mode with body mass index and visceral adiposity: a longitudinal study.</a></h2><p>Prospective data are sparse for active commuting to work and body weight in Asia. We assessed the association of 5-year changes in commuting mode with body mass index (BMI) and the indicators of abdominal  in Japanese working adults.In this longitudinal study, we studied 29,758 participants (25,808 men and 3950 women) in Japan aged 30 to 64 years at baseline who underwent further health examination 5 years after the baseline examination. Changes in BMI were calculated from objectively measured body height and weight at baseline and follow-up examination. Visceral and subcutaneous fat areas and waist circumference measured by computed tomography scans were used as indicators for abdominal adiposity. Linear regression was applied to estimate the association of changes in commuting mode with the  outcomes.Within the 5-year study period, adults who maintained inactive commuting gained weight, and compared with this group, adults who switched to inactive commuting had higher weight gain; conversely, adults who switched to active or public transportation commuting and especially those who maintained active or public transportation commuting experienced less weight gain. Subgroup analysis showed similar tendency across the different transitions of leisure-time exercise or occupational physical activity. For example, among adults who maintained no exercise (n = 16,087), the adjusted mean (95% confidence intervals) of the BMI change over 5 years in kg/m were 0.27 (0.24 to 0.30) for maintained inactive commuting group (reference), 0.34 (0.30 to 0.38) for switching to inactive commuting group (P = 0.046), 0.20 (0.18 to 0.22) for switching to active commuting or public transportation group (P = 0.001), and 0.09 (0.06 to 0.13) for maintained active commuting or public transportation group (P < 0.001). Maintained inactive commuting tended to be associated with larger gain in abdominal adiposity indicators.Switching from inactive commuting mode to more physically active commuting mode and maintaining active commuting can promote body weight control among working adults across different levels of occupational or leisure-time physical activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686879>Dual GIP-GLP1-Receptor Agonists In The Treatment Of Type 2 Diabetes: A Short Review On Emerging Data And Therapeutic Potential.</a></h2><p>The need for efficient and safe therapy to improve such metabolic diseases as  and type 2 diabetes mellitus is currently unmet.

To determine if and which aspects of signaling (basal, circadian, integrative, or reactivity) are associated with specific health outcomes, we reviewed recent studies that relate GCs to health outcomes. We identified papers through PubMed and reviewed 100 original research articles related to mental health, cardiovascular health, cancer, diabetes, , pulmonary health, sleep, and fitness. Many studies reported elevated GC secretion associated with worse health, but this was only particularly true for integrative GC measures. On the other hand, accentuated cortisol awakening response and a steeper circadian rhythm were both associated with positive health outcomes. Overall, relationships between GC secretion and health outcomes were relatively weak. This systematic review of relationships between GC metrics and health outcomes highlights the importance of careful consideration when selecting methods to measure GC regulation in health research.Copyright © 2019.

To date no studies have reported leptin reference intervals established in normal pregnancy, which could be used for interpreting the differences in leptin levels found in normal and pathological pregnancies.To determine leptin concentrations at delivery, in maternal serum in normal pregnancy and in cord blood and to establish reference intervals for leptin.The study was performed in 194 pregnant women without any comorbid health conditions. Leptin concentrations in maternal serum and in cord blood were measured by ELISA and subsequently analyzed by gestational age (weeks), maternal Body Mass Index (BMI), mode of delivery and infant gender and birth weight. For comparative analyses of normally distributed variables, parametric tests such as the Student-t were used to test the assumption of homogeneity or non-homogeneity of variance and a One-Way ANOVA when more than two groups were compared. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the correlation between normally distributed variables (p<0.05). The reference intervals for leptin were obtained by referring to the central 95% of laboratory test values.In normal pregnant women, the mean serum leptin concentration at delivery was 37.17 ± 28.07 ng/mL and the established reference interval was 33.19-41.14 ng/mL. The mean leptin concentration in cord blood was 14.78 ± 15.97 ng/mL and the established reference interval was 12.32-17.67 ng/mL. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between maternal serum and cord blood leptin concentrations (r = 0.37; p = 0.00). Mean leptin concentrations in cord blood increased with gestational age (p = 0.00). No statistically significant differences in maternal serum and cord blood leptin concentrations were found in regard to mode of delivery and neonatal gender. A statistically significant correlation was found between maternal serum leptin and third-trimester BMI (r = 0.22; p = 0.00), but there was no association between maternal BMI and cord blood leptin concentration. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between cord blood leptin concentration and birth weight (r = 0.23; p = 0.00).Reference intervals for leptin in maternal serum and in cord blood established in normal pregnancy could be used in clinical practice for interpreting the differences in leptin concentrations found in normal pregnancy and in complications of pregnancy. The results indicate a strong association between maternal serum leptin levels and  and between cord blood leptin levels and birth weight.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697209>No insulating effect of , neither in mice nor in humans.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692365>Sleep during Infancy and Associations with Childhood Body Composition: A Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis.</a></h2><p> Prevention of childhood overweight should start as early as possible preferably in "the first 1000 days of life." Sleep is one of the modifiable health behaviors during this age period, besides dietary intake and physical activity. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the existing literature regarding the association between sleep during infancy (age ≤24 months) and body composition measures during childhood (age ≤12 years).  We registered the protocol of this systematic review (PROSPERO registration no.

We searched for articles published until July 31, 2019 reporting on longitudinal associations with a minimal follow-up of 6 months. Methodological Quality was assessed and a narrative synthesis was performed.  We included 19 studies. Sleep was reported as sleep duration ( = 18) or sleep problems ( = 2). Sleep was assessed at least once before the age of 12 months in 14 out of the 19 studies. Methodological quality was rated as strong for five studies, moderate for five studies, and weak for nine studies.

Despite intervention programs designed to face a clinical status may last several months, no longitudinal studies have compared the effect of NW to another usual form of exercise, like walking (W). We evaluated the effects of diet combined with a long-supervised NW versus W training on body composition, aerobic capacity and strength in overweight adults.Thirty-eight participants, randomized into a NW (n=19, 66±7 years, body mass index (BMI) 33±5)) and a W (n=19, 66±8 years, BMI 32±5) group, followed a diet and a supervised training routine 3 times/week for 6 months. The variables assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6 months were: anthropometric indexes (ie, BMI and waist circumference (WC)), body composition, aerobic capacity (oxygen consumption (VO), peak power output (PPO), 6-min walking test (6MWT)) and strength (maximal voluntary contraction of biceps brachialis (MVC) and quadriceps femoris (MVC), chair stand and arm curl (AC)).After 6 months both NW and W group decreased significantly BMI (6% and 4%, respectively) and WC (8% and 4%, respectively), but only the NW group reduced (<0.05) total body fat (8%), android fat (14%) and leg fat (9%). After 6 months, PPO increased (<0.05) in both groups, but VO improved (<0.05) only in the NW group (8%). After 6 months, 6MWT increased (<0.001) in both groups and only the NW group improved (<0.05) in MVC (14%), MVC (17%) and AC (35%).Our results suggest that NW can give in some relevant health parameters, greater and faster benefits than W.

Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) effectively reduces weight, type-2 diabetes and dyslipidemia, but is also associated with preterm and small-for-gestational age births. The mechanism by which VSG impacts fetal development remains unknown. Here we hypothesize that previously reported immune changes during rat VSG pregnancy are reflected long-term in the immune system of the offspring. Offspring of VSG and Sham dams were evaluated at postnatal day (PND) 21 and PND60. At PND21, VSG pups have lower numbers of circulating B lymphocytes compared to Sham pups (P<0.05) and have lower transcription of lymphocyte marker  (P<0.01) in the spleen, while other lymphocyte populations measured are not different. Total plasma IgG is higher (P<0.01) and C reactive protein is lower (P<0.05) in VSG offspring compared to Sham offspring at PND21. The central nervous system of VSG pups is also affected at PND21, having higher expression of  mRNA (P<0.05) and higher immunoreactivity of microglia marker, IBA1, in the hypothalamus. At PND60, the immune-hematologic differences are not present, however, mRNA expression of  is elevated (P<0.001) in the spleen of VSG offspring along with markers of T cells. These data suggest that the immune system of VSG offspring is compromised early in life, but rebounds after weaning and may even become hyperactive.

The study was conducted in 2 groups. The first group included all the men hospitalized during 1 year (January-December 2009) in 2 clinics of cardiology, who were professionally active until the first myocardial infarction (MI). It comprised 243 men aged 26-70 years. The reference group consisted of 403 men, blue- and white-collar workers, aged 35-65 years.The body mass index of the MI patients was significantly higher (p = 0.006). The frequency of consumption of particular products in the MI group and in the reference group differed significantly for 11 of 21 products. The MI patients significantly less frequently reported the daily consumption of fruit, raw vegetables, cheese, vegetable oils and fish. In this group, the consumption of salty (p = 0.0226) or fatty (p < 0.0001) foods was significantly higher. It was shown that, after adjusting for age, education and the type of work, the daily consumption of fish, salads and cooked vegetables, as well as fruit and vegetable oils, significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction. An increased MI risk was, in turn, associated with  and preference for fatty foods.The authors found that diet significantly modified the MI risk in the examined workers.

The data were obtained from the 2015 Colombian Health and Wellbeing and Aging Survey. A total of 3307 elderly Colombian individuals (aged over 60 years) were included. Anthropometric data, fasting plasma glucose, blood lipid profiles, family history, and health-related behaviors were assessed, and prediabetes was defined as a fasting plasma glucose of 100 to 125 mg/dL. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) were calculated for each anthropometric indicator, using the prediabetes classification to identify their sensitivity and specificity, and these indicated that the prevalence of prediabetes was 25.3% in this population. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, the TyG index was strongly associated with the odds of having prediabetes in both sexes, and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the ORs for prediabetes increased across quartiles ( < 0.001). The TyG index was best able to identify prediabetes in either sex (AUC and optimal cut-off = 0.700 and 8.72, and 0.695 and 8.92 for men and women, respectively), suggesting that compared to the other parameters, the TyG index has the best discriminative power to predict prediabetes in the whole population.

Here, we show that old as compared to young antiviral CD8+TM more effectively harness disparate molecular processes (cytokine signaling, trafficking, effector functions, and co-stimulation/inhibition) that in concert confer greater secondary reactivity. The relative reliance on these pathways is contingent on the nature of the secondary challenge (greater for chronic than acute viral infections) and over time, aging CD8+TM re-establish a dependence on the same accessory signals required for effective priming of naïve CD8+T cells in the first place.

Reviewed modalities include anatomic imaging with CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); molecular imaging with FDG, fatty acids, and acetate; and emerging techniques. FDG-PET/CT is the most commonly used modality because of its widespread use in cancer imaging, but there are mechanistic reasons to believe other radiotracers may be more sensitive and accurate at detecting brown adipose tissue activity. Radiation-free modalities may help the longitudinal study of brown adipose tissue activity in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689910>The Role of Probiotics in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A New Insight into Therapeutic Strategies.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a broad spectrum of pathological hepatic conditions ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may predispose to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Due to the epidemic , NAFLD is representing a global health issue and the leading cause of liver damage worldwide. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is closely related to insulin resistance (IR), adiposity and physical inactivity as well as genetic and epigenetic factors corroborate to the development and progression of hepatic steatosis and liver injury. Emerging evidence has outlined the implication of gut microbiota and gut-derived endotoxins as actively contributors to NAFLD pathophysiology probably due to the tight anatomo-functional crosstalk between the gut and the liver. , nutrition and environmental factors might alter intestinal permeability producing a favorable micro-environment for bacterial overgrowth, mucosal inflammation and translocation of both invasive pathogens and harmful byproducts, which, in turn, influence hepatic fat composition and exacerbated pro-inflammatory and fibrotic processes. To date, no therapeutic interventions are available for NAFLD prevention and management, except for modifications in lifestyle, diet and physical exercise even though they show discouraging results due to the poor compliance of patients. The premise of this review is to discuss the role of gut-liver axis in NAFLD and emphasize the beneficial effects of probiotics on gut microbiota composition as a novel attractive therapeutic strategy to introduce in clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693009>Readjustable midurethral sling (REMEEX system) in obese women.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the success rate and patient satisfaction with the readjustable midurethral sling (REMEEX system) for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) with intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) or recurrent SUI in obese and non-obese women.Between August 2009 and August 2015, 70 patients who treated with the REMEEX system were stratified into normal, overweight and  groups according to body mass index. Objective surgical outcomes were evaluated using a 1-hour pad test that was performed 3 months after surgery. The subjective outcomes and degree of patient satisfaction were evaluated 3 months and 1 year after surgery.Twenty-six normal weight, 31 overweight, and 13 obese women were included in the study. The objective cure rate determined using the 1-hour pad test revealed that 11 women (42.3%) were cured and 15 (57.7%) had improved in the normal weight group, respectively, compared with 16 (51.6%) and 15 (48.4%) in the overweight group and 6 (46.2%) and 7 (53.8%) in the obese group, respectively (p=0.78). One year after surgery, the subjective success rate was 91.5% in the normal weight group, 93.5% in the overweight group and 92.3% in the obese group. A total of 84.7%, 77.4%, and 77.0% of normal weight, overweight and obese women were very satisfied or satisfied 1 year after surgery, respectively. All groups showed similar success rates and satisfaction.The REMEEX procedure is equally effective in obese and normal weight women with ISD-type SUI or recurrent SUI.© The Korean Urological Association, 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686410> as a risk factor of in-hospital outcomes in patients with endometrial cancer treated with traditional surgical mode.</a></h2><p>Abdominal  is a risk factor for endometrial cancer. The negative impact of individual parameters of  on the procedural effects of endometrial cancer surgical treatment has been suggested. The aim of the current study was to estimate the relationship of particular parameters of  and in-hospital outcomes in patients treated surgically due to endometrial cancer.The study included 70 women treated surgically for endometrial cancer. Pre-operatively, mass, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-hip ratio and selected anatomical indices were measured. The duration of surgery, hospitalisation, and the loss of haemoglobin served as parameters of in-hospital procedure success. Also, procedural-related complications were estimated.There were 37 (52.8%) obese females in the current study. They were obese patients presenting more advanced clinical stages of endometrial cancer before operation. The duration of operation (94.9 ± 21.6 min. vs. 76.1 ± 13.5 min., p < 0.0001), hospitalisation (12.4 ± 3.4 days vs. 10 ± 2.3 days, p = 0.0009) and haemoglobin loss (2.5 ± 0.9 g/dL vs. 1.9 ± 0.8 g/dL, p = 0.004) were significantly greater in obese patients. Multivariate analysis, among the independent predictors of the duration of operation, has confirmed the correlation between BMI, waist circumference and weight and the duration of hospitalisation. Waist and hip circumference and BMI coupled with external conjugate dimension and intertrochanteric distance have been linked with haemoglobin loss. The strongest correlation for the duration of operation, hospitalisation and haemoglobin loss was noticed for waist circumference (r = 0.7, r = 0.57 and r = 0.59).Waist circumference and BMI are strong predictors of in-hospital outcomes among patients with endometrial cancer treated via traditional surgical operation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696603>A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of a Fixed-Dose Combination of Phentermine/Topiramate in Adolescents with .</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of VI-0521, a fixed-dose combination of immediate-release phentermine (PHEN) and extended-release (ER) topiramate (TPM) in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with . Weight loss and adverse events using this drug combination are also reported.This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-design, placebo-controlled study in adolescents with . 42 adolescents were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, mid-dose (PHEN/TPM 7.5 mg/46 mg), or top-dose (PHEN/TPM 15 mg/92 mg) of VI-0521. A total of 26 adolescents were included in the PK analysis (14 from the mid-dose group and 12 from the top-dose group).At Day 56, arithmetic means of terminal elimination half-life (T ), apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (Vc/F) were consistent across dose levels for both PHEN and TPM. Arithmetic means of CL/F and Vc/F for PHEN and TPM administered as a combination in adolescents with  were within 10%-30% of those previously assessed in adults with  enrolled in Phase II and III studies. A higher proportion of adolescents in both the mid- and top-dose groups (13.3% and 50.0%, respectively) compared with placebo (0.0%) reached ≥5% weight loss at Day 56. The least square (LS) mean change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to Week 56 was -5.2 mmHg for the placebo group, -2.5 mmHg for the mid-dose group, and -5.5 mmHg for the top-dose group. The LS mean change in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline to Day 56 was -2.4 mmHg for the placebo group, +3.8 mmHg for the mid-dose group, and +2.0 mmHg for the top-dose group. Participants in the top-dose group had increases in heart rate from baseline of 4.1 bpm while participants in the mid-dose group experienced a mean decrease in heart rate of 4.5 bpm at Day 56. Both PHEN/TPM dose combinations were safe and well tolerated.Treatment of adolescents with  using a fixed-dose combination of phentermine/topiramate for 8 weeks resulted in exposure to PHEN and TPM that was comparable to that observed in adults, statistically significant weight loss, and a tolerable safety profile. These data indicate that both mid- and top-doses are appropriate for longer term safety and efficacy studies in adolescents. This article is protected by copyright.

The hedonic and analgesic effects of sucrose overlap and hedonic response to sweet food is associated with adiposity. The potential association between the analgesic effects of intraoral sucrose in the newborn period and subsequent weight gain has not been examined. Healthy, term newborns received 25% intraoral sucrose or water prior to metabolic screen heel stick. Negative affect, quiet alert behavior, and sleepiness were coded during heel stick. Weight and length were measured and z-score (WLZ) calculated at birth, 9, and 18 months. Mixed models tested associations of behavioral response to heel stick with WLZ trajectory among infants receiving sucrose (n = 154) versus water (n = 117). Among infants receiving sucrose prior to heel stick with birth WLZ ≥ the median, less negative affect and more sleepiness during heel stick were each associated with greater increases in WLZ. These associations were not present among infants receiving water only prior to heel stick. Greater analgesic effects of sucrose in the neonate were associated with greater future increases in WLZ, especially among infants with higher birth WLZ. Greater opioid-mediated newborn behavioral response to intraoral sucrose may be a marker for future  risk. CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: .Copyright © 2019.

Metabolic factors are associated with NCI, but their relationships to cluster-derived NCI profiles are unknown.Participants (144 PLWH and 102 HIV uninfected) aged 50+ years completed a neuropsychological battery assessing seven cognitive domains. Latent class analysis (LCA) identified NCI profiles separately by HIV serostatus and in a combined sample. Obtained classes were examined against the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and diagnoses of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Multinomial regression identified metabolic predictors of classification.LCA identified three latent classes in each participant sample: Class1Multidomain NCI (high probability of impairment across multiple domains), Class 2Learning & Recall NCI (high probability of impairment in learning and recall), and Class 3NC Unimpaired (low probability of NCI across all domains). Severity of NCI implied by classes corresponded with MoCA scores and HAND diagnoses. In analyses on the combined sample, compared to HIV-uninfected individuals, PLWH were more likely to be in Class1Multidomain NCI. Among PLWH, those with dyslipidemia and hypertension had greater odds of classification in Class 1Multidomain NCI while those with central  had higher odds of classification in Class 2Learning & Recall NCI; metabolic syndrome approached significance as a differential predictor. Regardless of HIV status, individuals with diabetes were more likely to be in Class 1Multidomain NCI.Metabolic risk factors confer heightened risk of NCI in HIV infection.

In this review, we outline recent preclinical and clinical cardiovascular-related discoveries about GIP. These include chronotropic and blood pressure-lowering effects of GIP. Furthermore, GIP has been suggested to control vasodilation via secretion of nitric oxide, and vascular leukocyte adhesion and inflammation via expression and secretion of endothelin 1. Also, GIP seems to regulate circulating lipids via effects on adipose tissue uptake and metabolism of lipids. Lastly, we discuss how dysmetabolic conditions such as  and type 2 diabetes may shift the actions of GIP in an atherogenic direction, and we provide a perspective on the therapeutic potential of GIP receptor agonism and antagonism in cardiovascular diseases. We conclude that GIP actions may have implications for the development of cardiovascular disease, but also that the potential of GIP-based drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular disease currently is uncertain.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, reducing adverse childhood experiences is critical to avoiding multiple negative health and socioeconomic outcomes in adulthood.Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data were collected from 25 states that included state-added adverse childhood experience items during 2015-2017. Outcomes were self-reported status for coronary heart disease, stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer (excluding skin cancer), kidney disease, diabetes, depression, overweight or , current smoking, heavy drinking, less than high school completion, unemployment, and lack of health insurance. Logistic regression modeling adjusting for age group, race/ethnicity, and sex was used to calculate population attributable fractions representing the potential reduction in outcomes associated with preventing adverse childhood experiences.Nearly one in six adults in the study population (15.6%) reported four or more types of adverse childhood experiences. Adverse childhood experiences were significantly associated with poorer health outcomes, health risk behaviors, and socioeconomic challenges. Potential percentage reductions in the number of observed cases as indicated by population attributable fractions ranged from 1.7% for overweight or  to 23.9% for heavy drinking, 27.0% for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 44.1% for depression.Efforts that prevent adverse childhood experiences could also potentially prevent adult chronic conditions, depression, health risk behaviors, and negative socioeconomic outcomes. States can use comprehensive public health approaches derived from the best available evidence to prevent childhood adversity before it begins. By creating the conditions for healthy communities and focusing on primary prevention, it is possible to reduce risk for adverse childhood experiences while also mitigating consequences for those already affected by these experiences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695914>Associations between self-reported diabetes mellitus, disordered eating behaviours, weight/shape overvaluation, and health-related quality of life.</a></h2><p>Eating disorders (ED) and disordered eating behaviours (DEB) have been found to be common in people with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, findings have been inconsistent.This study investigated the association between self-reported diabetes (Type 1 or 2) with ED/DEB (binge eating, subjective binge eating or loss of control overeating, severe dieting and purging) weight/shape overvaluation, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a household survey in South Australia.In 2017 2977 people aged ≥15 years, who were representative of the general population, were interviewed. Participants reported their gender, age, household income, highest educational attainment, area of residence, presence of DM, ED/DEB, level of overvaluation, current HRQoL and height and weight. For the analyses between ED/DEB, self-reported DM and HRQoL, a grouping variable was created: 1) people without ED/DEB or self-reported DM; 2) people without ED/DEB and with self-reported DM; 3) people with ED/DEB and without self-reported DM; and 4) people with ED/DEB and self-reported DM. Analyses were stratified by sex and age group.Subjective binge eating prevalence was higher in people with self-reported DM (6.6% vs 2.8%,  = 0.016), and overvaluation was lower in those with DM (36% vs 43.8%,  = 0.007). In analyses stratified by sex and age group, subjective binge eating was higher in women and in people over 45 years with self-reported DM and overvaluation was lower in men and in people over 45 years with self-reported DM. However, these differences were not significant on tests of gender and age interaction. People in both DM groups scored significantly lower than people without DM groups on physical HRQoL. In contrast, people in both ED/DEB groups scored lower than people without ED/BEB on mental HRQoL.People with self-reported DM had a higher prevalence of subjective binge eating, a lower prevalence of overvaluation and there were no significant effects of age or gender. Furthermore, participants with self-reported DM and comorbid ED or DEB had impairments of both mental and physical HRQoL. Assessing an individual's sense of control over eating along with other DEB is likely important for identification of these mental health problems.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688574>Association between  type and obstructive coronary artery disease in stable symptomatic postmenopausal women: data from the KoRean wOmen'S chest pain rEgistry (KoROSE).</a></h2><p>This study investigated the association between  type and obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in postmenopausal women.Study data were obtained from a nation-wide registry, composed of 659 women older than 55 years with chest pain undergoing elective invasive coronary angiography in the suspicion of CAD.

Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to determine empirically-driven typologies of maternal feeding styles. Chi-square analyses tested the association of maternal feeding styles with child overweight or obese (vs. not) weight status.Two maternal feeding styles were identified by LCA which we term "High Coercive Control" (27% child overweight/obese) and "Low Coercive Control" (55% child overweight/obese). High Coercive Control mothers were more likely to believe their child was too thin, self-reported being more demanding in feeding and pressuring the child to eat, worried more about their child not eating enough and were observed to use more bribery. Low Coercive Control mothers were concerned about their child eating too much, and were less likely to self-report engaging in pressuring or restricting feeding behaviors.The findings suggest that although there is a "feeding style" characterized by substantial control, this style was most common among mothers of thinner children. The mothers of children with overweight/ were primarily characterized by engaging in the "recommended" feeding behaviors and being appropriately concerned about their child's risk for excess weight.Copyright © 2019.

Sweet proteins are a relatively unstudied class of sweet compounds that could serve as innovative sweeteners, but their introduction on the food market has been delayed by some factors, among which is the lack of thorough metabolic and toxicological studies. We have tried to shed light on the potential of a sweet protein, MNEI, as a fructose substitute in beverages in a typical western diet, by studying the metabolic consequences of its consumption on a Wistar rat model of high fat diet-induced . In particular, we investigated the lipid profile, insulin sensitivity and other indicators of metabolic syndrome. We also evaluated systemic inflammation and potential colon damage. MNEI consumption rescued the metabolic derangement elicited by the intake of fructose, namely insulin resistance, altered plasma lipid profile, colon inflammation and translocation of lipopolysaccharides from the gut lumen into the circulatory system.

Puberty status was assessed according to Tanner scale and testicular volume. Serum levels of pregnenolone, 17-OH progesterone, corticosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and androstenedione were detected by LC-MS. Serum free testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay.The 17-OH progesterone, DHEA, androstenedione and free testosterone levels of OW/OB boys at prepubertal stage or at the age 6 = < 10 years group were higher than those of the NW boys (all the P values were < 0.01). Furthermore, androstenedione and free testosterone levels were lower in OW/OB boys at late puberty, and the trend continued at the post pubertal stage for FT (P < 0.01-0.05). DHEA, androstenedione, and FT levels persisted to be higher at the 10~ < 12 years in OW/OB boys but not for 17-OH progesterone. FT level was lower in the OW/OB group at the 12~ < 15 years group.

It is currently unclear how complement integrates into our current model of molecular pathogenesis in HS and whether is represents a central component of pathogenesis, or a neutrophil-associated bystander. Levels of C5a in serum and tissue correlate with disease activity and degree of neutrophilic infiltrates in HS. C5a has been associated with Th17 immune axis activation in psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease with strong similarities to TH17 activation in HS. Porphyromonas species (which are identified in the HS microbiome) are able to cleave inactive C5 into C5a implicating the cutaneous microbiome as an activator of complement. C3a and C5a are associated with activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, implicated in the inflammatory drive in HS. Complement receptors are present upon dendritic cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, and adipocytes which may broaden the potential contribution of complement to multiple aspects of HS pathogenesis. Dysregulation of complement receptor pathways have been documented in , insulin resistance and polycystic ovarian syndrome leading to the possibility that complement may explain the epidemiological associations between these conditions and HS. The therapeutic potential of complement inhibitors in HS may be related to the therapeutic target (complement receptor or complement subunit), and the presence of alternate receptors (such as C5aR2) or ligands (including C3a, PAMPs and DAMPs). Integrating complement into the known pathogenesis of HS may aid in explaining the contradictory results between Phase 2 studies of C5a antagonists. It also allows for the identification of existing knowledge gaps to target further clinical investigation and research.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

MiR-92a is negatively correlated with the activity of brown adipocytes. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of miR-92a on brown adipocytes. The expression of miR-92a in C2C12 cell was detected by a quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). C2C12 cells were induced to brown adipocytes. The direct target gene of miR-92a was determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Brown adipocytes were treated with isoprenaline (Iso) and transfected by miR-92a inhibitor and siSMAD7. The expression of heat-producing genes and adipose differentiation genes related to brown adipocytes were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The expression of SMAD7, p-SMAD2, and p-SMAD3 were detected using Western blot analysis. The mitochondrial content was measured by mitotracker fluorescent staining. MiR-92a inhibitor significantly decreased the expression of miR-92a in C2C12 cells. MiR-92a inhibitor could upregulate the expression of Ucp1, Cox7a1, Elovl3, Ppargc1α, PPARγ, and FABP4, and its effect on Ucp1 was increased after the treatment of isoprenaline. Moreover, miR-92a inhibitor increased mitochondrial content, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the expression of SMAD7 and suppressed the expressions of p-SMAD2 and p-SMAD3, whereas miR-92a directly targeted SMAD7 to exert its inhibitory effects. SiSMAD7 reversed the effects of the inhibitor on heat-producing genes, mitochondrial content, OCR and the expressions of SMAD7, p-SMAD2, and p-SMAD3 in brown adipocytes. Blocking miR-92a might promote brown adipocytes differentiation, mitochondrial oxidative respiration, and thermogenesis by targeting SMAD7 to inhibit the expressions of p-SMAD2 and p-SMAD3.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691768>Projection of new thresholds for hypertension to outpatient clinic patients and impact of risk factors: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines on hypertension management recommend new stage 1 hypertension thresholds (130-139/80-89 mmHg) for starting antihypertensive treatment.To analyze the impact of the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines on patients' diagnoses within daily practice, in comparison with management using the 2018 European hypertension guidelines, regarding the new thresholds.Cross-sectional study conducted in a hypertension outpatient clinic at a tertiary-level public hospital.The diagnosis of hypertension was defined separately using each guideline.

Berberine, a natural isoquinoline alkaloid, has antiobesity properties. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained unclear up to now. In this study, porcine adipocytes were cultured and treated with berberine. Cellular lipid content was measured by Oil Red O staining extraction. The role of an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway was evaluated by the phosphorylation detection of AMPKα protein and knockdown of AMPK alpha1 (Ampka1) gene. Gene expressions were analyzed by Western blot and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that berberine reduced lipid accumulation in porcine adipocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner and increased phosphorylation of AMPKα. Furthermore, berberine significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of related genes to adipogenesis including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 2 (Pparg2), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (Cebpa), Cebp beta (Cebpb), sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (Acc-1), fatty acid synthase (Fas), fatty acid binding protein 4 (Fabp4), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1). Knockdown of Ampka1 markedly reversed the inhibitory effect of berberine on lipid accumulation and mRNA expression of the above genes except Cebpb in porcine adipocytes. Meanwhile, the protein expression of these adipogenic genes in response to berberine and Ampka1 knockdown paralleled the alterations of their mRNA level. These results suggest that berberine inhibits adipogenesis in porcine adipocytes via AMPK-dependent and -independent multiple mechanisms, which would provide an important idea for the reduction of porcine body fat, as well as the prevention and treatment of human .© 2019 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693802>Methods and Risks of Bias in Natural Experiments in : Opportunities for the Future Informed by a Systematic Review.</a></h2><p>This paper promotes rigorous methods and designs currently underutilized in  research, informed by a recent systematic review of the methods and risks of bias in studies of policies, programs, and built environment changes for  prevention and control.To determine the current state of the field, relevant databases from 2000 to 2017 were searched to identify studies that fit the inclusion criteria.

One possible explanation might rely on the little comprehension of obese maladaptive schemas, as developed from early life experiences, which might interfere with treatment enduring efficacy. The aim of this study was to investigate early maladaptive schemas, their associated current schema-modes and dysfunctional coping strategies in overweight and obese individuals (N = 48). Results showed that overweight and obese subjects reported more severe insufficient self-control, abandonment, dependence and subjugation schemas, and actual schema-modes (i.e., impulsive and vulnerable child, detached protector), compared against normal-weight controls (N = 37). As well, the former displayed higher dysfunctional eating habits (i.e., bingeing and bulimic symptoms) and more emotional-avoidant coping strategies. Above all schemas, insufficient self-control predicted higher BMI, binge frequency and bulimic symptoms' severity. Furthermore, avoidant coping mediated between specific maladaptive schemas and frequency of bingeing and bulimic symptoms. Our findings illustrate that overweight and obese display more dysfunctional early maladaptive schemas and schema-modes, compared against normal-weight individuals, exhibiting more emotion-avoidant strategies such as over-eating and bingeing, which might stand for a detached self-soother coping mode. The insufficient self-control schema develops from a lack in self-discipline and an inability to tolerate frustration and might be embodied by the impulsive child mode. A deeper comprehension of schemas and modes, as addressed within the Schema Therapy model, might help to understand dysfunctional personality features that might interfere with the long-lasting efficacy of treatment interventions in .© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689902>Factors Predicting the Response to a Vitamin D-Fortified Milk in Healthy Postmenopausal Women.</a></h2><p>Milk products fortified with vitamin D may constitute an alternative to pharmacological supplements for reaching the optimal levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D].

The most used technique for quantifying human BAT activity is the measurement of  F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake via a positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan following exposure to cold. However, several studies have indicated the measurement of the supraclavicular skin temperature (SST) by infrared thermography (IRT) to be a less invasive alternative. This work reviews the state of the art of this latter method as a means of determining BAT activity in humans.The data sources for this review were PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost (SPORTdiscus), and eligible studies were those conducted in humans.In most studies in which participants were first cooled, an increase in IRT-measured SST was noted. However, only 5 of 24 such studies also involved a nuclear technique that confirmed increased activity in BAT, and only 2 took into account the thickness of the fat layer when measuring SST by IRT.More work is needed to understand the involvement of tissues other than BAT in determining IRT-measured SST; at present, IRT cannot determine whether any increase in SST is due to increased BAT activity.© 2019 Leiden University Medical Center.  published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc., on behalf of The  Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687133>Concurrent bariatric surgery and surgical resection of massive localized lymphedema of the thigh.

Histologically, it may be mistaken for well-differentiated liposarcoma; hence, it is also known as pseudosarcoma.We describe the successful management of MLL of the left medial thigh in a 35-year-old man weighing 220 kgs (BMI 80.8 kgs/m2). He underwent a concurrent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with surgical resection of the MLL. He recovered well and during our last follow up six months after the operation, he is ambulating well and weighs 148 kgs (BMI 54.4 kgs/m2).MLL is a form of secondary lymphedema resulting in disruption or compression of normal lymphatic drainage due to fat accumulation in obese patients. Patients usually delay treatment for even up to a decade, when it becomes sufficiently large enough to restrict mobility and daily activities, or when it becomes infected. MLL is primarily a clinical diagnosis. A detailed history regarding its slow growth spanning over the years makes malignancy less likely. However, if left untreated, MLL may progress to angiosarcoma. Imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) and a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are usually performed to rule out malignancy or vascular malformations.

Student's t test and Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the statistical significance.Although WES identified ∼74,000 variants in individual samples, using various pipelines. variants in genes namely phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) and oxysterol-binding protein-related protein10 (OSBPL10) that have roles in dietary choline intake and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, respectively, were identified (discovery set). Furthermore, significant differences were noted in BMI (p = 0.006), waist/hip circumference (p > 0.001), waist/hip ratio (p > 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (p > 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (p > 0.001), and triglycerides (p = 0.002) between patients and controls. Validation of variants (rs7946-PEMT and rs2290532-OSBPL10) revealed that variant in PEMT but not OSBPL10 gene was associated (p = 0.04) with threefold increased risk of NAFLD in lean individuals.Our results demonstrate the association of rs7946 with lean-NAFLD. WES may be an effective strategy to identify causative variants underlying lean-NAFLD.© 2019 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Previously we reported a positive association between sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption and -related cancer but this association was not fully explained by ; in contrast, we found no association for consumption of artificially-sweetened soft drinks. Our aim was to determine whether the consumption of sugar-sweetened or artificially-sweetened soft drinks was associated with cancers other than those currently identified as being related to . We used data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. Participants completed a 121-item food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline including separate questions about the number of times in the past year they had consumed sugar-sweetened and artificially-sweetened soft drinks. Cox regression models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the risk of cancers not related to . During 19 years of follow-up, there were 35,109 eligible participants who developed 4,789 cancers not related to . There was no association between frequency of consuming sugar-sweetened soft drinks and the risk of these cancers, but an unexpected positive association was observed for consumption of artificially-sweetened soft drinks. Although, we did not find an association with sugar-sweetened soft drinks, we previously reported a positive association with -related cancers, not fully explained by . These findings leave unresolved the question of whether consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks influences cancer risk independently of their influence on body size.

We aimed to assess the short- and long-term cardiovascular outcomes of patients with CAD undergoing bariatric surgery. Patients with a history of CAD were identified from a dedicated database with prospectively collected outcomes, comprising all 6795 patients who underwent bariatric surgery between January 1992 and October 2017. Patients were matched with patients who did not have CAD before the bariatric surgery procedure. The primary endpoints were mortality (cardiac and noncardiac) and major adverse cardiocerebral events (MACCE), including all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and myocardial revascularization at 30 days after bariatric surgery and throughout follow-up. After propensity score matching, 249 patients with chronic CAD were matched with 249 patients without CAD. Throughout follow-up (7.4 years; interquartile range 4.1 to 11.5, maximum 22 years), mortality (mainly cardiac mortality) remained significantly higher in the CAD compared with the non-CAD group (18% vs 10%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 2.79, p = 0.037). At 30 days, MACCE rate was significantly higher in the CAD compared with the non-CAD group (3.6% vs 0.4%, p = 0.011), essentially driven by non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions. After 30 days, MACCE rates remained significantly higher in the CAD group (30% vs 14%, HR 2.18, 95% CI: 1.45-3.28, p = 0.0002). In conclusion, patients with severe  and CAD referred to bariatric surgery were at a higher risk of early and late MACCE compared with non-CAD severely obese patients. Further study is required to define how this cardiovascular risk compares with nonoperated patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, 22,058 women without symptomatic menopause were matched by propensity scores and enrolled as a comparison group. The propensity score was calculated by using all characteristic variables of each subject, including demographics (age and monthly income), comorbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, , chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dysrhythmia, peripheral artery occlusive disease), Charlson's comorbidity index score, clinic visit frequency, and long-term medications (antihypertensives, antidiabetic agents, statins, antiplatelets, aspirin, warfarin, and hormone replacement therapy). The primary endpoint was the development of stroke after the onset of symptomatic menopausal transition. The Fine and Gray's proportional subhazards model was performed to assess the association between symptomatic menopausal transition and subsequent stroke. All subjects were followed up until December 31, 2013.During a mean follow-up of 8.5 years (standard deviation 4.7 years, maximum 14 years), 2,274 (10.31%) women with symptomatic menopausal transition, and 1,184 (5.37%) matched comparison participants developed stroke. The incidence rates were 11.17 per 1,000 person-years in the symptomatic menopausal transition group compared with 8.57 per 1,000 person-years in the comparison group. The risk of developing stroke was significantly higher in women with symptomatic menopausal transition (crude subhazard ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.22-1.41];  < 0.001). After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, clinic visit frequency, and long-term medications, the risk of stroke remained statistically significant (adjusted subhazard ratio, 1.30; 95% CI [1.21-1.40];  < 0.001). Moreover, subgroup analyses revealed no evidence for inconsistent effects for symptomatic menopausal transition on subsequent risk of stroke across all subgroups except age, comorbidities, hypertension, and use of antihypertensives. Women with early menopausal transition (before age 50), without comorbid condition, without hypertension, or without use of antihypertensives are at a higher risk of stroke. The longer duration of symptomatic menopausal transition was associated with higher risk of stroke ( for trend < 0.001).In this large-scale retrospective cohort study, symptomatic menopausal transition was statistically significantly associated with a 30% increased risk of stroke. Further prospective studies are required to confirm our findings.© 2019 Yu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688606>Rising Prevalence of Opioid Use Disorder and Predictors for Opioid Use Disorder Among Hospitalized Patients With Chronic Pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>We aimed to evaluate the prevalence, impact, and predictors of opioid use disorder (OUD) in hospitalized chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients.A retrospective cohort study was performed using the National Inpatient Sample database from 2005 to 2014. Patients with a primary diagnosis of CP and OUD were included. The primary outcome was evaluating the prevalence and trend of OUD in patients hospitalized with CP. Secondary outcomes were to (1) assess the impact of OUD on health care resource utilization and (2) identify predictors of OUD in hospitalized CP patients.A total of 176,857 CP patients were included, and OUD was present in 3.8% of patients. The prevalence of OUD in CP doubled between 2005 and 2014. Patients with CP who had OUD were found to have higher mean length of stay (adjusted mean difference, 1.2 days; P < 0.001) and hospitalization costs (adjusted mean difference, US $1936; P < 0.001). Independent predictors of OUD in CP patients were , presence of depression, and increased severity of illness.Opioid use disorder-related diagnoses are increasing among CP patients and are associated with increased health care resource utilization.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is one pathogenic factor in the development of insulin resistance in patients with . We explored whether mitochondrial dysfunction correlates with insulin resistance and other metabolic complications.We investigated the changes of mRNA expression of genes encoding selected subunits of oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and citrate synthase (CS) in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) and peripheral monocytes (PM) and mitochondrial enzyme activity in platelets of 24 patients with active Cushing's syndrome and in 9 of them after successful treatment and 22 healthy control subjects.Patients with active Cushing's syndrome had significantly increased body mass index (BMI), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and serum lipids relative to the control group. The expression of all investigated genes for selected mitochondrial proteins was decreased in SCAT in patients with active Cushing's syndrome and remained decreased after successful treatment. The expression of most tested genes in SCAT correlated inversely with BMI and HOMA-IR. The expression of genes encoding selected OXPHOS subunits and CS was increased in PM in patients with active Cushing's syndrome with a tendency to decrease toward normal levels after cure. Patients with active Cushing's syndrome showed increased enzyme activity of complex I (NQR) in platelets.Mitochondrial function in SCAT in patients with Cushing's syndrome is impaired and only slightly affected by its treatment which may reflect ongoing metabolic disturbances even after successful treatment of Cushing's syndrome.© 2019 Ježková et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696216>Lack of adipose-specific hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase causes inactivation of adipose glucocorticoids and improves metabolic phenotype in mice.</a></h2><p>Excessive glucocorticoid (GC) production in adipose tissue promotes the development of visceral  and metabolic syndrome. 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) is critical for controlling intracellular GC production, and this process is tightly regulated by hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH). To better understand the integrated molecular physiological effects of adipose H6PDH, we created a tissue-specific knockout of the H6PDH gene mouse model in adipocytes (H6PDHAcKO mice). H6PDHAcKO mice exhibited almost complete absence of H6PDH expression and decreased intra-adipose corticosterone production with a reduction of 11β-HSD1 activity in adipose tissue. These mice also had decreased abdominal fat mass, which was paralleled by decreased adipose lipogenic ACC and ACL gene expression and reduction of their transcription factor C/EBPα mRNA levels. Moreover, H6PDHAcKO mice also had reduced fasting blood glucose levels, increased glucose tolerance, and increased insulin sensitivity. In addition, plasma FFA levels were decreased with a concomitant decrease in the expression of lipase ATGL and HSL in adipose tissue. These results indicate that inactivation of adipocyte H6PDH expression is sufficient to cause intra-adipose GC inactivation that leads to a favorable pattern of metabolic phenotypes. These data suggest that H6PDHAcKO mice may provide a good model for studying the potential contributions of fat-specific H6PDH inhibition to improve the metabolic phenotype in vivo. Our study suggests that suppression or inactivation of H6PDH expression in adipocytes could be an effective intervention for treating  and diabetes.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697646>Catalpol induces autophagy and attenuates liver steatosis in ob/ob and high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Impaired autophagy has been implicated in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Catalpol (CAT), a bioactive compound from  (Di Huang) , is known to ameliorate insulin resistance and the histological NAFLD spectrum in obese mice. Here, we investigated the effects of CAT on hepatic steatosis and autophagy in ob/ob and high-fat diet-induced obese mice, as well as in hepatocytes. In ob/ob mice, CAT reduced liver weight, liver triglyceride and cholesterol content, and hepatic lipogenic enzyme levels and increased fatty acid oxidase levels. In addition, CAT administration increased LC3-II levels and decreased SQSTM1/P62 levels in ob/ob mice. Similar effects on hepatic steatosis and autophagy were observed in high-fat diet-induced mice after administration of CAT. Additionally, we found that CAT stimulated AMPK and increased nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) in obese mice and hepatocytes. Inhibition of AMPK completely blocked the effects of CAT on TFEB nuclear localization, hepatic autophagy, and liver steatosis. These findings revealed that diminished AMPK/TFEB-dependent autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of liver steatosis in , and that CAT might be a novel therapeutic candidate for treatment of this condition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689486>POMC neurons dysfunction in diet-induced metabolic disease: hallmark or mechanism of disease?</a></h2><p>One important lesson from the last decade of studies in the field of systemic energy metabolism is that  is first and foremost a brain disease. Hypothalamic neurons dysfunction observed in response to chronic metabolic stress is a key pathogenic node linking consumption of hypercaloric diets with body weight gain and associated metabolic sequelae. A key hypothalamic neuronal population expressing the neuropeptide Pro-opio-melanocortin (POMC) displays altered electrical activity and dysregulated neuropeptides production capacity after long-term feeding with hypercaloric diets. However, whether such neuronal dysfunction represents a consequence or a mechanism of disease, remains a subject of debate. Here, we will review and highlight emerging pathogenic mechanisms that explain why POMC neurons undergo dysfunctional activity in response to caloric overload, and critically address whether these mechanisms may be causally implicated in the physiopathology of  and of its associated co-morbidities.Copyright © 2019 IBRO.
