The percent contribution of glycogenolysis and  to glucose production (GP) was estimated from the relative enrichments of hydrogen 5 and hydrogen 2 of plasma glucose. Fasting plasma glucose levels were normal in both groups (87+/-7 and 87+/-24 mg/dl for healthy and cirrhotic subjects, respectively). The percent contribution of glycogen to GP was smaller in cirrhotics than controls (22+/-7% versus 46+/-4%, P<0.001), while the contribution from  was larger (78+/-7% versus 54+/-4%, P<0.001). In all subjects, glucose 6R and  hydrogens had similar enrichments, consistent with extensive exchange of 2H between body water and the hydrogens of gluconeogenic oxaloacetate (OAA). The difference in 2H-enrichment between hydrogen 5 and hydrogen  was significantly larger in cirrhotics, suggesting that the fractional contribution of glycerol to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P)-moiety of plasma glucose was higher compared to controls (19+/-6% versus 7+/-6%, P<0.01). In all subjects, hydrogens 4 and 5 of glucose had identical enrichments while hydrogen 3 enrichments were systematically lower. This reflects incomplete exchange between the hydrogen of water and that of 1-R-dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) or incomplete exchange of DHAP and G3P pools via triose phosphate isomerase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30058123>Sources of hepatic glycogen synthesis in mice fed with glucose or fructose as the sole dietary carbohydrate.</a></h2><p>The positional analysis of hepatic glycogen enrichment from deuterated water ( H O) by  H NMR has been applied previously to resolve the contributions of glucose and fructose to glycogen synthesis in rodents fed a high sucrose diet. To further validate this method, this analysis was applied to mice fed with synthetic diets whose carbohydrate components consisted solely of either glucose or fructose.Eight glucose-fed and 12 fructose-fed mice were given  H O followed by ad libitum feeding overnight. Mice were then euthanized, hepatic glycogen was isolated and derivatized to monoacetone glucose, and  H-enrichment of positions 2, 5, and 6 were measured by  H NMR. From these data, the fraction of overnight glycogen appearance from the direct pathway and/or glycogen cycling and indirect pathway were estimated. Indirect pathway fractions were resolved into Krebs cycle and triose-phosphate sources-the latter including contributions from fructose metabolism.After overnight feeding, the fraction of overnight glycogen appearance derived from direct pathway and/or glycogen cycling in glucose-fed-mice was 63 ± 1%. For the indirect pathway, Krebs cycle and triose-phosphate sources contributed 22 ± 1% and 15 ± 1%, respectively. For fructose-fed-mice, glycogen appearance was dominated by triose-phosphate sources (60 ± 2%) with lesser contributions from Krebs cycle (14 ± 1%) and direct and/or glycogen cycling (26 ± 2%). H NMR analysis of hepatic glycogen  H enrichment from  H O provides realistic profiles of dietary glucose and fructose contributions to hepatic glycogen synthesis in mice fed with diets containing 1 or the other sugar as the sole carbohydrate source.© 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11551863>An integrated (2)H and (13)C NMR study of  and TCA cycle flux in humans.</a></h2><p>Hepatic glucose synthesis from glycogen, glycerol, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was measured in five overnight-fasted subjects by (1)H, (2)H, and (13)C NMR analysis of blood glucose, urinary acetaminophen glucuronide, and urinary phenylacetylglutamine after administration of [1,6-(13)C(2)]glucose, (2)H(2)O, and [U-(13)C(3)]propionate. This combination of tracers allows three separate elements of hepatic glucose production (GP) to be probed simultaneously in a single study: 1) endogenous GP, 2) the contribution of glycogen, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and glycerol to GP, and 3) flux through PEP carboxykinase, pyruvate recycling, and the TCA cycle. Isotope-dilution measurements of [1,6-(13)C(2)] glucose by (1)H and (13)C NMR indicated that GP in 16-h-fasted humans was 10.7 +/- 0.9 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1). (2)H NMR spectra of monoacetone glucose (derived from plasma glucose) provided the relative (2)H enrichment at glucose H-2, H-5, and H-, which, in turn, reflects the contribution of glycogen, PEP, and glycerol to total GP (5.5 +/- 0.7, 4.8 +/- 1.0, and 0.4 +/- 0.3 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1), respectively). Interestingly, (13)C NMR isotopomer analysis of phenylacetylglutamine and acetaminophen glucuronide reported different values for PEP carboxykinase flux (68.8 +/- 9.8 vs. 37.5 +/- 7.9 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1)), PEP recycling flux (59.1 +/- 9.8 vs. 27.8 +/- 6.8 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1)), and TCA cycle flux (10.9 +/- 1.4 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.4 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1)). These differences may reflect zonation of propionate metabolism in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25995077>Demonstration of glucose-6-phosphate hydrogen 5 enrichment from deuterated water by transaldolase-mediated exchange alone.</a></h2><p>Enrichment of glucose position 5 (H5) from deuterated water ((2)H2O) is widely used for quantifying . Exchanges of hexose and triose phosphates mediated by transaldolase have been postulated to enrich H5 independently of , but to date this mechanism has not been proven. We determined the enrichment of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), the immediate precursor of endogenously produced glucose, from (2)H2O in erythrocyte hemolysate preparations. Here, transaldolase exchange is active but  is absent.Hemolysates were prepared from human erythrocytes and incubated with a buffer containing 5% [U-(13)C]G6P, unlabeled fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and 10% (2)H2O. G6P (2)H-enrichment and (13)C-isotopomer distributions were analyzed by (2)H and (13)C NMR following derivatization to monoacetone glucose.(2)H NMR analysis revealed high (2)H-enrichment of G6P hydrogens 2, 4, and 5; low enrichment of hydrogen 3, and residual enrichments of hydrogens 1, 6R, and . (13)C NMR isotopomer analysis revealed that [U-(13)C]G6P was converted to [1,2,3-(13)C3]G6P, a predicted product of transaldolase-mediated exchange, as well as [1,2-(13)C2]G6P and [3-(13)C]G6P, predicted products of combined transaldolase and transketolase exchanges.Hydrogen 5 of G6P was enriched from (2)H2O through exchanges mediated by transaldolase. These studies prove that G6P can be enriched in hydrogen 5 by (2)H2O independently of .© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p></html>
