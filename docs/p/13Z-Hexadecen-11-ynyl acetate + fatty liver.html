Data of 30 women of 18-40 years of age, with normal hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp at baseline and body mass index (BMI) < 30, who opted to use DMPA or a copper intrauterine device (IUD) as a contraceptive, were analysed. Serum samples were collected for evaluation of the lipid and hepatic profile, C-reactive protein, TNF-α, interleukin-6, leptin/adiponectin ratio and free  acids; body composition was evaluated using DXA, blood pressure and carotid intima-media thickness were measured. Evaluations were performed at baseline and 12 months later. The groups were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significance level was 5%.The mean age of the women in the DMPA and IUD group was 28.7 ± 6.5 and 28.3 ± 5.8 years, respectively; the BMI was 23.0 ± 3.4 and 24.3 ± 2.7 kg/m, respectively, in the same groups. At 12 months, triglyceride levels were higher in the DMPA group compared to the IUD group and there was an increase in apolipoprotein B-100 in relation to baseline in DMPA group; there were no other difference between the groups.No clinical cardiovascular effect was found but deterioration in CV markers was observed in the first year of use of DMPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760672>Effect of Oat and Tartary Buckwheat - Based Food on Cholesterol - Lowering and Gut Microbiota in Hypercholesterolemic Hamsters.</a></h2><p>The nutritional components in oat and tartary buckwheat had been assessed to have cholesterollowering effects. However, The effect of oat and tartary buckwheat based-food (OF) on cholesterol-lowering and gut microbiota in hypercholesterole hamsters was still limited studied because they are usually consumed in whole gran as well as after being processed. In this study, normal diets, high fat diet (HFD) with/without OF were fed to hamsters for 30 days respectively and growth parameters, metabolic parameters, and gut microbiota were investigated, respectively. It was found that OF significantly decreased plasma total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol), lowered  TC, cholesterol ester (CE), and triglycerides (TG) concentrations, and increased fecal weight and bile acids (BA) concentrations, compared with HFD (p < 0.05). Moreover, the concentrations of , propionate, butyrate and total short-chain  acids (SCFAs) were significantly increased in hamsters fed with OF, compared with HFD (p < 0.05). OF changed the overall structure of gut microbiota. The relative abundances of Erysipelotrichaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae were decreased and the relative abundance of Eubacteriaceae was increased, compared with HFD. These results suggested that OF could reduce the concentrations of plasma lipid by inhibiting cholesterol absorption in  and promoting excretions of fecal lipid and BA. And it also increased SCFAs and modulated the gut microbiota effectively to exert the hypocholesterolemic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30366037>The effects of LXR agonist GW3965 on vascular reactivity and inflammation in hypertensive rat aorta.</a></h2><p> X receptors (LXRs) play an important role in the regulation of cholesterol,  acid and glucose metabolisms together with inflammatory processes. In the present study, the effects of LXR agonist GW3965 on vascular reactivity and expression of functional proteins in DOCA-Salt induced hypertension were examined.Hypertension was induced through unilateral nephrectomy and deoxycorticosterone- (DOCA) injection (20 mg/kg, twice a week) for 6 weeks in male Wistar albino rats (8 weeks old). An LXR agonist GW3965 (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was administered to animals for last seven days.GW3965 treatment reduced systolic blood pressures in hypertensive rats. Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent and sodium nitroprusside-induced endothelium-independent vasorelaxations were decreased in hypertensive rats but not affected by GW3965. GW3965 treatment enhanced plasma nitrite levels in normotensive rats. KCl and phenylephrine (Phe)-induced vasocontractions were reduced in hypertensive groups and increased with GW3965 treatment. Decreased sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase2 (SERCA2) expression in the hypertensive aorta was not changed by GW3965 treatment. Expression of inositoltrisphosphate receptor1 (IP3R1) was increased by GW3965 in normotensive animals. The nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) expressions were increased in hypertensive rats and reduced by GW3965 treatment.The results of study indicate that the LXR agonist, GW3965, exhibited a beneficial effect on increased blood pressure and improved hypertension-induced impairment in contractile activity of vessel and inflammatory markers in vascular tissue. Therefore, these effects of LXR agonists on vessel should be taken into account in experimental or therapeutic approaches to hypertension.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that  is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain  acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29389635>Effects of antioxidative substances from seaweed on quality of refined  oil of leafscale gulper shark, Centrophorus squamosus during an accelerated stability study.</a></h2><p>Crude  oil of leafscale gulper shark, Centrophorus squamosus was clarified by sequential degumming, decolorization and vacuum deodorization. The refined oil was added with ethyl  extract of seaweeds and various physiochemical parameters were evaluated in a time-reliant accelerated storage study. Significantly greater induction time was observed for the oil supplemented with Sargassum wightii and Sargassum ilicifolium (>4.5h) than other seaweed extracts and control oil (~1h). Among different seaweeds, the ethylacetate extracts of S. wightii maintained the oxidation indices of the refined oil below the marginal limits after the study period. No significant reduction in C long chain  acids (1.19%) in the refined oil added with S. wightii was apparent, and was comparable with the synthetic antioxidants (1.07-1.08%). Spectroscopic fingerprint analysis of marker compounds responsible to cause rancidity signified the efficacy of S. wightii to arrest the development of undesirable oxidation products in the refined oil during storage. The antioxidant compounds, 15-(but-19-enyl)-hexahydro-13,16-dimethyl-11-oxo-1H-isochromen-8-yl benzoate (1) and 10-(but-13-en-12-yl)-5-((furan-3-yl)propyl)-dihydrofuran-9(3H)-one (2) isolated from S. wightii appeared to play a major role to deter the oxidative degradation of refined oil thereby enhancing the storage stability.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Fish (average initial weight: 0.59 g) were fed diet supplemented with 0, 50, 100, 300 and 500 mg α-tocopherol /kg in triplicates, which were found to, respectively, contain 11.2, 56.3, 114.6, 306.5 and 588.4 mg α-tocopherol/kg diet. Results showed that final weight, body weight gain and specific growth rate significantly increased with increasing dietary VE supplemented level from 11.2 to 56.3 mg/kg. When the broken-line model was employed to estimate the adequate requirement of vitamin E based on body weight gain, the optimal level was 55.5 mg/kg in diet. Hepatosomatic index value significantly decreased with incremental dietary VE levels. However,  VE concentration showed a direct relationship with the dietary VE level. The percentages of 20:5n-3, 22:6n-3 and total n-3 long chain polyunsaturated  acids in  increased with increasing dietary VE supplementation. Meanwhile, the expressions of PPAR-α, PPAR-β and PPAR-γ in  were down-regulated by supplementation of dietary VE level from 56.3 to 588.4 mg/kg. In conclusion, supplementation of more than 55.5 mg/kg vitamin E may improve growth and increase n-3 LC-PUFA content in blunt snout bream, which is beneficial to human consumer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28733671>Short-chain  acids and inulin, but not guar gum, prevent diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance through differential mechanisms in mice.</a></h2><p>The role of dietary fibre and short-chain  acids (SCFA) in obesity development is controversially discussed. Here, we investigated how various types of dietary fibre and different SCFA ratios affect metabolic syndrome-related disorders. Male mice (B6) were fed high-fat diets supplemented with dietary fibres (either cellulose, inulin or guar gum) or different Ac:Pr ratios (high  (HAc) or propionate (HPr)) for 30 weeks. Body-fat gain and insulin resistance were greatly reduced by inulin, but not by guar gum, and completely prevented by SCFA supplementation. Only inulin and HAc increased body temperature, possibly by the induction of beige/browning markers in WAT. In addition, inulin and SCFA lowered hepatic triglycerides and improved insulin sensitivity. Both, inulin and HAc reduced hepatic  acid uptake, while only inulin enhanced mitochondrial capacity and only HAc suppressed lipogenesis in . Interestingly, HPr was accompanied by the induction of Nrg4 in BAT. Fermentable fibre supplementation increased the abundance of bifidobacteria; B. animalis was particularly stimulated by inulin and B. pseudolongum by guar gum. We conclude that in contrast to guar gum, inulin and SCFA prevent the onset of diet-induced weight gain and hepatic steatosis by different mechanisms on  and adipose tissue metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668417>Hepatoprotective activity of Erythrina × neillii leaf extract and characterization of its phytoconstituents.</a></h2><p>Natural antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents have the ability to restore normal balance to destructed  cells.

In addition, the hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of three doses of E. × neillii alcoholic leaf extract (100, 250, 500 mg/kg) were investigated in methotrexate (MTX)-intoxicated rats and were compared with those of silymarin-treated rats.  function parameters were obtained, and a histopathological study was performed. In addition, the anti-inflammatory mediators and the antioxidant system in the  tissues were assessed.The dichloromethane extract revealed an abundance of alkaloids (25), in addition to tentatively identifying flavone (1), flavanone (1) and three  acids. Additionally, thirty-six compounds belonging to different classes of phytoconstituents with a predominance of flavonoids (21), O/C-flavone and flavonol glycosides, followed by alkaloids (9),  acids (4) and (2), and phenolic glycoside were identified in the ethyl  extract. Compared with MTX, alcoholic leaf extract (500 mg/kg) ameliorated the MTX-induced alterations by improving several biochemical marker levels, fighting oxidative stress in serum and  tissues, and decreasing inflammatory mediators; this finding was further confirmed by the histopathological study.This study reveals E. × neillii, a rich source of flavonoids and alkaloids, which could be further exploited to provide a promising and safe antihepatotoxic agent source.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

Terminalia arjuna W. & Arn. (Combretaceae) is an endemic tree found in India and Sri Lanka and used traditionally for its cardioprotective and hepatoprotective effects. Arjunolic acid (AA) is an oleanane triterpenoid found mainly in the heartwood of T. arjuna. This study was aimed to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of AA using cellular and rodent models of NAFLD. AA was isolated from the ethyl  extract of the heartwood of T. arjuna. The structure of AA was confirmed by physical and spectroscopic data. Steatosis was induced in HepG2 cells using palmitate-oleate mixture and the effects of AA on triglyceride accumulation and lipotoxicity were assessed. In vivo effect of AA on NAFLD was assessed using HFD fed rats. The treatment with AA did not affect the cell viability upto 100 μM and showed GI value of 379.9 μM in HepG2 cells. The treatment with AA significantly lowered the ORO concentration by 35.98% and triglyceride accumulation by 66.36% at 50 μM concentration (P < 0.005) compared to the vehicle treated group. The treatment with AA also reduced the leakage of ALT and AST by 61.11 and 48.29% in a significant manner (P < 0.005). The in vivo findings clearly demonstrated that the animals treated with AA at 25 and 50 mg/kg concentrations showed a significant decrease in the levels of transaminases, phosphatase and GGT (P < 0.005). In the , the expression of PPARα and FXRα expressions were upregulated, while PPARγ expression was downregulated by the treatment with AA. The  histology of the animals showed reduction in steatosis and MNC infiltration. These preliminary evidences suggested that AA might be a promising lead to treat NAFLD. Future robust scientific studies on AA will lead to tailoring it for the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A two-way analysis of variance was then applied to assess the effects of diet and oil and the interaction between them.After 8 weeks of feeding, the obesogenic diet increased the body weight and the  mass and fat content, whereas decreased the cecal  and butyrate concentration. This diet also altered the plasma lipid profile and decreased the  sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) content. However, the lowest  SREBP-1c content was observed in rats fed an obesogenic diet containing strawberry seed oil. Moreover, dietary strawberry seed oil decreased the cecal short-chain  acid concentrations (, propionate, and butyrate) regardless of the diet type, whereas the cecal β-glucuronidase activity was considerably increased only in rats fed an obesogenic diet containing strawberry seed oil. Dietary strawberry seed oil also lowered the  fat content, the plasma triglyceride level and the atherogenic index of plasma.Strawberry seed oil has a potent lipid-lowering activity but can unfavorably affect microbial metabolism in the distal intestine. The observed effects are partly due to the synergistic action of the oil and the obesogenic diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900399>The effect of synbiotics  and milk oligosaccharides on shaping gut microbiota community structure and NASH treatment.</a></h2><p>Probiotic  subspecies  () consumes human milk oligosaccharides (MO) and protects intestinal permeability thereby having anti-inflammatory effects (Underwood et al., 2015; Bode, 2006; Asakuma et al., 2011) [1-3].

Comparing metabolite profile differences between germ-free and conventionally raised mice against differences between mice fed a low- and high-fat diet (HFD), we identified tryptamine and indole-3- (I3A) as metabolites that depend on the microbiota and are depleted under a HFD. Both metabolites reduced -acid- and LPS-stimulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and inhibited the migration of cells toward a chemokine, with I3A exhibiting greater potency. In hepatocytes, I3A attenuated inflammatory responses under lipid loading and reduced the expression of  acid synthase and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) detoxifies acetaldehyde into . Subpopulations of Asians and Native Americans show polymorphism with loss-of-function mutations in ALDH2. We evaluated the effect of ALDH2 deficiency on EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions and adherens junctions, gut barrier dysfunction, and  injury.Wild-type and ALDH2-deficient mice were fed EtOH (1 to 6%) in Lieber-DeCarli diet for 4 weeks. Gut permeability in vivo was measured by plasma-to-luminal flux of FITC-inulin, tight junction and adherens junction integrity was analyzed by confocal microscopy, and  injury was assessed by the analysis of plasma transaminase activity, histopathology, and  triglyceride.EtOH feeding elevated colonic mucosal acetaldehyde, which was significantly greater in ALDH2-deficient mice. ALDH2(-/-) mice showed a drastic reduction in the EtOH diet intake. Therefore, this study was continued only in wild-type and ALDH2(+/-) mice. EtOH feeding elevated mucosal inulin permeability in distal colon, but not in proximal colon, ileum, or jejunum of wild-type mice. In ALDH2(+/-) mice, EtOH-induced inulin permeability in distal colon was not only higher than that in wild-type mice, but inulin permeability was also elevated in the proximal colon, ileum, and jejunum. Greater inulin permeability in distal colon of ALDH2(+/-) mice was associated with a more severe redistribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins from the intercellular junctions. In ALDH2(+/-) mice, but not in wild-type mice, EtOH feeding caused a loss of junctional distribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins in the ileum. Histopathology, plasma transaminases, and  triglyceride analyses showed that EtOH-induced  damage was significantly greater in ALDH2(+/-) mice compared to wild-type mice.These data demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency enhances EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions, barrier dysfunction, and  damage.Copyright © 2015 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31051508>Using metabolic profiling and gene expression analyses to explore molecular effects of replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat-a randomized controlled dietary intervention study.</a></h2><p>Replacing dietary saturated  acids (SFAs) with polyunsaturated  acids (PUFA) reduces the plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and subsequently the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, beyond changes in LDL cholesterol, we lack a complete understanding of the physiologic alterations that occur when improving dietary fat quality.The aim of this study was to gain knowledge of metabolic alterations paralleling improvements in the fat quality of the diet.We recently conducted an 8-wk, double-blind, randomized controlled trial replacing SFAs with PUFAs in healthy subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia (n = 99). In the present substudy, we performed comprehensive metabolic profiling with multiple platforms (both nuclear magnetic resonance- and mass spectrometry-based technology) (n = 99), and analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression (n = 95) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.A large number of lipoprotein subclasses, myristoylcarnitine and palmitoylcarnitine, and kynurenine were reduced when SFAs were replaced with PUFAs. In contrast, bile acids, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, , and acetoacetate were increased by the intervention. Some amino acids were also altered by the intervention. The mRNA levels of LXRA and LDLR were increased, in addition to several  X receptor α target genes and genes involved in inflammation, whereas the mRNA levels of UCP2 and PPARD were decreased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after replacing SFAs with PUFAs.

HCD+PE-treated mice exhibited decreased serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and reduced atherosclerotic lesion area compared with HCD mice. These beneficial effects of PE were not observed in the HCD+PE+A group. Incubation of Caco-2 cells with butyrate, but not  and propionate, down-regulated the expression of Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 but up-regulated the ATP-binding cassette transporters G5 and G8 (ABCG5 and G8) at the mRNA level. Butyrate treatment also increased transcriptional activity of  X receptor in Caco-2 cells. Our data suggest that butyrate from PE intestinal fermentation protects mice from the progression of diet-induced atherosclerosis in apoE mice. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which dietary fiber may prevent the development of atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2018.

Primary hepatocytes represent the gold standard for studying the mechanisms controlling hepatic glucose, lipid, and cholesterol metabolism in vitro. However, access to primary hepatocytes can be limiting, and therefore, other immortalized hepatocyte models are commonly used. Here, we describe substrate metabolism of cultured AML12, IHH, and PH5CH8 cells, hepatocellular carcinoma-derived HepG2s, and primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) to identify which of these cell lines most accurately phenocopy PMH basal and insulin-stimulated metabolism. Insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in PH5CH8 cells, and to a lesser extent AML12 cells, responded most similarly to PMH. Notably, glucose incorporation in HepG2 cells were 14-fold greater than PMH. The differences in glucose metabolic activity were not explained by differential protein expression of key regulators of these pathways, for example glycogen synthase and glycogen content. In contrast,  acid metabolism in IHH cells was the closest to PMHs, yet insulin-responsive  acid metabolism in AML12 and HepG2 cells was most similar to PMH. Finally, incorporation of  into intracellular-free cholesterol was comparable for all cells to PMH; however, insulin-stimulated glucose conversion into lipids and the incorporation of  into intracellular cholesterol esters were strikingly different between PMHs and all tested cell lines. In general, AML12 cells most closely phenocopied PMH in vitro energy metabolism. However, the cell line most representative of PMHs differed depending on the mode of metabolism being investigated, and so careful consideration is needed in model selection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26409956>Abundance of ruminal bacteria, epithelial gene expression, and systemic biomarkers of metabolism and inflammation are altered during the peripartal period in dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Seven multiparous Holstein cows with a ruminal fistula were used to investigate the changes in rumen microbiota, gene expression of the ruminal epithelium, and blood biomarkers of metabolism and inflammation during the transition period. Samples of ruminal digesta, biopsies of ruminal epithelium, and blood were obtained during -14 through 28d in milk (DIM). A total of 35 genes associated with metabolism, transport, inflammation, and signaling were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Among metabolic-related genes, expression of HMGCS2 increased gradually from -14 to a peak at 28 DIM, underscoring its central role in epithelial ketogenesis. The decrease of glucose and the increase of nonesterified  acids and β-hydroxybutyrate in the blood after calving confirmed the state of negative energy balance. Similarly, increases in bilirubin and decreases in albumin concentrations after calving were indicative of alterations in  function and inflammation. Despite those systemic signs, lower postpartal expression of TLR2, TLR4, CD45, and NFKB1 indicated the absence of inflammation within the epithelium. Alternatively, these could reflect an adaptation to react against inducers of the immune system arising in the rumen (e.g., bacterial endotoxins). The downregulation of RXRA, INSR, and RPS6KB1 between -14 and 10 DIM indicated a possible increase in insulin resistance. However, the upregulation of IRS1 during the same time frame could serve to restore sensitivity to insulin of the epithelium as a way to preserve its proliferative capacity. The upregulation of TGFB1 from -14 and 10 DIM coupled with upregulation of both EGFR and EREG from 10 to 28 DIM indicated the existence of 2 waves of epithelial proliferation. However, the downregulation of TGFBR1 from -14 through 28 DIM indicated some degree of cell proliferation arrest. The downregulation of OCLN and TJP1 from -14 to 10 DIM indicated a loss of tight-junction integrity. The gradual upregulation of membrane transporters MCT1 and UTB to peak levels at 28 DIM reflected the higher intake and fermentability of the lactation diet. In addition, those changes in the diet after calving resulted in an increase of butyrate and a decrease of ruminal pH and , which partly explain the increase of Anaerovibrio lipolytica, Prevotella bryantii, and Megasphaera elsdenii and the decrease of fibrolytic bacteria (Fibrobacter succinogenes, Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus). Overall, these multitier changes revealed important features associated with the transition into lactation. Alterations in ruminal epithelium gene expression could be driven by nutrient intake-induced changes in microbes; microbial metabolism; and the systemic metabolic, hormonal, and immune changes. Understanding causes and mechanisms driving the interaction among ruminal bacteria and host immunometabolic responses merits further study.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

SCFA (formate, , propionate, butyrate) are formed by the anaerobic carbohydrates fermentation and branched-chain  acids (BCFA), such as isobutyric and isovaleric acids, are derived from amino acids valine and leucine. Phenylcarboxylic acids (PCA), such as phenylacetic acid (PAA), phenyipropionic acid (PPA), phenyllactic acid (PLA) and some other acids, are metabolites of amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine involved in host adaptation and regulation. ma unique experiment, the authors first examined effect of the carboxylic acids on host cell proliferation in organotypic tissue cultures (rat spleen explants). The study showed that almost all biogenic aliphatic carboxylic acids have a positive effect on cell proliferation in rat spleen tissue. This fundamentally distinguishes them from amino acids, many of which have an inhibitory effect at the same concentrations. These findings suggest that SCFA, including hydrox~ and oxo derivatives, can act as positive regulators of host immune tissues. Some SCFA (for example, butyric acid), stimulate proliferation of normal host cells (immune tissue, intestinal epithelium), but inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells ('butyrate paradox'). Unlike SCFA, phenylcarboxylic acids have a negative effect on host immune tissues explants and induce apoptosis. These data confirm the potential contribution of phenylcarboxylic acids in the pathogenesis of chronic disorders associated with impaired immune response, including autoimmune diseases. The authors suggest that PCA may serve as early metabolic markers of sepsis, immune-related diseases and chronic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (iBD), colorectal cancer, chronic kidney disease and , secondary imrnunodeficiency. It can be assumed that carboxylic acids are evolutionary precursors of amino acids that have a wide variety of functions and able to modulate not only proliferation but also apoptosis. The results agree well with the data obtained in the study of Actoflor-C (microbial metabolites complex) and can be used to study mechanisms of action of probiotic strains and metabiotics (e.g. butyrate and propionate-containing formulations), as well as for the development of innovative medicines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28539646>Colonic infusions of short-chain  acid mixtures promote energy metabolism in overweight/obese men: a randomized crossover trial.</a></h2><p>Short-chain  acids (SCFA), formed by microbial fermentation, are believed to be involved in the aetiology of obesity and diabetes. This study investigated the effects of colonic administration of physiologically relevant SCFA mixtures on human substrate and energy metabolism. In this randomized, double-blind, crossover study, twelve normoglycaemic men (BMI 25-35 kg/m) underwent four investigational days, during which SCFA mixtures (200 mmol/L) high in either  (HA), propionate (HP), butyrate (HB) or placebo (PLA) were rectally administered during fasting and postprandial conditions (oral glucose load). Before and for two hours after colonic infusions, indirect calorimetry was performed and blood samples were collected. All three SCFA mixtures increased fasting fat oxidation (P < 0.01), whilst resting energy expenditure increased after HA and HP compared with PLA (P < 0.05). In addition, all three SCFA mixtures increased fasting and postprandial plasma peptide YY (PYY) concentrations, and attenuated fasting free glycerol concentrations versus PLA (P < 0.05). Colonic infusions of SCFA mixtures, in concentrations and ratios reached after fibre intake, increased fat oxidation, energy expenditure and PYY, and decreased lipolysis in overweight/obese men. Human intervention studies are warranted to investigate whether these effects translate into long-term benefits for body weight control and insulin sensitivity in the obese insulin resistant state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27439969>Distal, not proximal, colonic  infusions promote fat oxidation and improve metabolic markers in overweight/obese men.</a></h2><p>Gut microbial-derived short-chain  acids (SCFA) are believed to affect host metabolism and cardiometabolic risk factors. The present study aim was to investigate the effects of proximal and distal colonic infusions with the SCFA  on fat oxidation and other metabolic parameters in men. In this randomized, double-blind crossover trial, six overweight/obese men [body mass index (BMI) 25-35 kg/m] underwent two experimental periods: one with distal and one with proximal colonic sodium  infusions. A feeding catheter was endoscopically positioned at the beginning of each period and remained in the colon for three consecutive test days, enabling colonic  (100 or 180 mmol/l) or placebo infusion during fasting conditions and after an oral glucose load (postprandial). Fat oxidation and energy expenditure were measured using an open-circuit ventilated hood system and blood samples were repeatedly collected for 2 h during fasting and postprandial conditions. Distal colonic 180 mmol/l  infusions increased fasting fat oxidation (1.78±0.28 compared with -0.78±0.89 g fat 2 h, P=0.015), fasting peptide YY (PYY, P=0.01) and postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations (P<0.05), and tended to increase fasting plasma  (P=0.069) compared with placebo. Distal 100 mmol/l  administration tended to decrease fasting tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; P=0.067) compared with placebo. In contrast, proximal colonic  infusions showed no effects on substrate metabolism, circulating hormones or inflammatory markers. In conclusion distal colonic  infusions affected whole-body substrate metabolism, with a pronounced increase in fasting fat oxidation and plasma PYY. Modulating colonic  may be a nutritional target to treat or prevent metabolic disorders.© 2016 The Author(s). published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30396473>Inverse relationship between human erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate and short-chain  acid levels.</a></h2><p>In muscle cells, fructose is initially metabolised to fructose-6-phosphate. In the , fructose is metabolised to fructose-1-phosphate and thence to glyceraldehydes, which in turn can either enter glycogenolysis via pyruvate or gluconeogenesis via fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. High levels of fructose-1-phosphate inhibit both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. We hypothesised that, if systemically absorbed short-chain  acids constitute a major metabolic fate of unabsorbed dietary fructose, then levels of erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate would be inversely correlated with plasma levels of short-chain  acids. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis in respect of the three main short-chain  acids , propionate and butyrate. Venous blood samples from 39 patients (16 male, 23 female, mean (standard error) age 42.4 (3.3) years) were analysed. Erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate was measured using quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectrometry following gel electrophoresis, while plasma , propionate and butyrate levels were measured using gas-liquid chromatography. The erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate level was inversely correlated with the plasma  (r = -0.30, p = 0.06), propionate (r = -0.31, p = 0.05) and butyrate (r = -0.40, p = 0.01). These results support our hypothesis. The conversion of unabsorbed dietary fructose into short-chain  acids may represent a protective mechanism against the adverse effects of hypoglycaemia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Reversal was attempted by protocols with tuna oil-supplemented diets [4% soy oil (SO) and 3% tuna oil (SO-T3) or 3% SO and 7% tuna oil (SO-T7)] and compared with control SO diets (7% or 10% SO) 4 wk after stress. The PPARG agonist rosiglitazone was evaluated in a 1 wk preventive protocol (30 mg · kg⁻¹ · d⁻¹). Erythrocytes were assessed to confirm LCPUFA uptake and tissue expression of lipoprotein lipase and glycerol kinase as indicators of PPARG activation. Colonic mast cell degranulation was evaluated by toluidine blue staining. In vitro, human mast cell line 1 (HMC-1) cells were pretreated with rosiglitazone, eicosapentaenoic acid, or docosahexaenoic acid, stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and calcium ionophore or compound 48/80 and evaluated for tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and β-hexosaminidase release.Stress led to visceral hypersensitivity in all groups. Hypersensitivity was not reversed by SO-T3 or control treatment [prestress vs. 24 h poststress vs. posttreatment area under the curve; 76 ± 4 vs. 128 ± 12 (P < 0.05) vs. 115 ± 14 and 82 ± 5 vs. 127 ± 16 (P < 0.01) vs. 113 ± 19, respectively].

Erythrocytes showed significant LCPUFA uptake in the absence of colonic PPARG activation. Rosiglitazone induced increased PPARG target gene expression, but did not prevent hypersensitivity. Mast cell degranulation never differed between groups. Rosiglitazone and LCPUFAs significantly reduced PMA/calcium ionophore-induced TNF-α release but not degranulation of HMC-1 cells.Dietary LCPUFAs did not reverse stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity in maternally separated rats. Although further research is needed, claims concerning LCPUFAs as a treatment option in IBS cannot be confirmed at this point and should be regarded with caution.© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29883724>Alisol A 24- ameliorates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis by inhibiting oxidative stress and stimulating autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR pathway.</a></h2><p>Alisol A 24- (AA), a natural triterpenoid isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Rhizoma Alismatis, has various therapeutic effects.

C57BL/6 mice were fed a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 4 weeks to induce NASH. The mice were simultaneously treated with a daily dose of AA (15, 30, and 60 mg kg, ig) for 4 weeks. On the last day, the animals were sacrificed and plasma and  tissue were collected. Serum and  tissue biochemical analyses and histological observation were performed. The human hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 was used to build NASH models by culturing with conditioned medium from WRL-68  cells after exposure to MCD medium in vitro.  oxidative stress and inflammatory indices and autophagy markers were examined. The results showed that AA suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation in a NASH mouse model and inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines and ROS in LX-2 cells in MCD medium. Furthermore, we found AA stimulated autophagy in mice  and LX-2, which could be the underlying mechanism of AA in NASH. To further investigate the role of autophagy in LX-2 cells, we found that AA regulated autophagy via the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathway and dorsomorphin, a selective AMPK inhibitor, led to the suppression of AA-induced autophagy. Taken together, our results indicate that AA could be a possible therapy for NASH by inhibiting oxidative stress and stimulating autophagy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In study 1, 2 in vitro trials were conducted as randomized complete experiments with a 2×2 factorial treatment arrangement (10 or 100 mg/kg added Cu and 0 or 10% Linpro, DM basis) to determine VFA/gas production and IVDMD. Linpro contains 12% α-linolenic acid and added vitamins and minerals. In study 2, a randomized complete block experiment with a 2×2 factorial treatment arrangement was conducted with the same previously described treatment. Crossbred yearling heifers (n=261; 351±23 kg initial BW) were blocked by weight into heavy and light groups and randomly assigned to experimental pens containing 10 or 11 heifers each. In study 1, no interactions between levels of Cu and Linpro were observed. Copper concentration did not affect IVDMD (P>0.2) but increased (P<0.05) by 1.2% when Linpro was included. Final pH was not effected by added Cu (P>0.05), but pH increased when Linpro was added (P<0.05). Total VFA were greater in high-Cu treatments (P=0.038) and molar proportions were not affected (P>0.34). Linpro had no effect on total VFA (P=0.46) and molar proportions of propionate and isobutyrate increased whereas  and the :propionate ratio decreased (P<0.01). Linpro increased the production of H2S (30% higher; P=0.05), and Cu inclusion slightly increased CO2 proportion (64.06 vs. 67.58% for Linpro vs. Cu treatments, respectively). In study 2, there were no interactions between levels of Linpro and supplemental Cu except for plasma n-6:n-3 ratio (P<0.01). Final BW were similar for cattle fed 0 and 10% Linpro (581 vs. 588 kg; P>0.20), but cattle fed diets with Linpro consumed less feed (14.08 vs. 13.59 kg/d; P<0.05) and were therefore more efficient (0.129 vs. 0.137 for 0 vs. 10% Linpro, respectively; P<0.01).

After 75 days of treatment, the animals were euthanized. The LPEF contained a high level of monomeric anthocyanins (301.4 mg/100g) and marked antioxidant activity.Catalase activity was reduced in G3, G4, G5 and G6 compared to G2. Superoxide dismutase was reduced only in G4. The animals in G4, G5, and G6 showed low HDL and triglycerides levels compared to G2. The proportion of lipid droplets in  tissue was reduced in G4 and G5 compared to G2, G3, and G6.The results indicated that E. edulis pulp is rich in anthocyanins and the LPEF dietary consumption can reduce the severity of  steatosis in apoE-/- mice, an effect that is potentially mediated by the antioxidant activity of this extract and modulation of triglyceride serum levels.Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014.

These efforts could have a direct impact on our ability to understand metabolic abnormalities that affect the pathophysiology of  and allow us to examine mechanisms surrounding potential therapeutic interventions. Briefly, one method couples the continuous infusion of [(13)C] with direct real-time measurements of [(13)C]glutamate labeling in ; the other method administers [(13)C]propionate, in combination with other tracers, and subsequently measures the (13)C labeling of plasma glucose and/or acetaminophen-glucuronide. It appears that a controversy has arisen, since the respective methods yielded different estimates of the anaplerotic/TCA flux ratio (VANA:VTCA) in "control" subjects, i.e., the [(13)C]- and [(13)C]propionate-derived VANA:VTCA flux ratios appear to be ∼1.4 and ∼5, respectively. While the deep expertise in the respective groups makes it somewhat trivial for each to perform the tracer studies, the data interpretation is inherently difficult. The current perspective was undertaken to examine potential factors that could account for or contribute to the apparent differences. Attention was directed toward 1) matters of practicality, 2) issues surrounding stoichiometry, and 3) hidden assumptions.

The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active microbiota. Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, -produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human diseases is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic dysbiosis (a particular form of dysbiosis) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic dysbiosis is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic dysbiosis. Since in the metabolic dysbiosis metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in colon (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic dysbiosis are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain  acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly deoxycholic acid). These kinds of metabolic dysbiosis can eventually lead to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal cancer (CRC). The metabolic dysbiosis due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and tyrosine derivatives (phenyl carboxylic acid, p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic acid, indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronic administration of the  acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor [3-(3-carbamoylphenyl)phenyl]N-cyclohexylcarbamate (URB597) on the endocannabinoid system and on the redox balance in the livers of DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Hypertension caused an increase in the levels of endocannabinoids [anandamide (AEA), 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG) and N-arachidonoyl-dopamine (NADA)] and CB1 receptor and the activities of FAAH and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). These effects were accompanied by an increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a decrease in antioxidant activity/level, enhanced expression of transcription factor Nrf2 and changes to Nrf2 activators and inhibitors. Moreover, significant increases in lipid, DNA and protein oxidative modifications, which led to enhanced levels of proapoptotic caspases, were also observed. URB597 administration to the hypertensive rats resulted in additional increases in the levels of AEA, NADA and the CB1 receptor, as well as decreases in vitamin E and C levels, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities and Nrf2 expression. Thus, after URB597 administration, oxidative modifications of cellular components were increased, while the inflammatory response was reduced. This study revealed that chronic treatment of hypertensive rats with URB597 disrupts the endocannabinoid system, which causes an imbalance in redox status. This imbalance increases the levels of electrophilic lipid peroxidation products, which later participate in metabolic disturbances in  homeostasis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To address this question, we assessed rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation in subjects with and without NAFLD by monitoring the rate of (13)C labeling in hepatic [5-(13)C]glutamate and [1-(13)C]glutamate by (13)C MRS during an infusion of [1-(13)C]. We found that rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation were similar between NAFLD and control subjects. We also assessed rates of hepatic pyruvate cycling during an infusion of [3-(13)C]lactate by monitoring the (13)C label in hepatic [2-(13)C]alanine and [2-(13)C]glutamate and found that this flux was also similar between groups and more than 10-fold lower than previously reported. Contrary to previous studies, we show that hepatic mitochondrial oxidation and pyruvate cycling are not altered in NAFLD and do not account for the hepatic fat accumulation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

(Saururaceae) is used traditionally in Asian countries to treat various disease symptoms.To study the effect of H. cordata ethyl  (HC-EA) extract on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis.HFD fed rats were orally dosed with HC-EA (100, 200, or 300 mg/kg) once daily for 8 weeks and the lipid profiles and protein expressions in hepatocytes were evaluated.HFD rats showed an increase (p < 0.05) in the plasma lipid levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), free  acids (FFAs), and reduced the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Treatment with HC-EA extract (300 mg/kg) restored the changes in plasma lipid levels of TC, TG, LDL, FFA, and HDL in HFD-fed rats by 34.8, 31.1, 51.4, 32.4, and 56.3%, respectively, compared with control rats (p < 0.01). HC-EA treatment also decreased the hepatic lipid accumulation (p < 0.001 at 300 mg/kg) and improved hepatic histological lesions. HC-EA extract enhanced AMPK phosphorylation and its primary downstream targeting enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), up-regulated the gene expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1), and down-regulated sterol regulatory element binding protein 1,  acid synthase, and glutamate pyruvate transaminase protein levels in the livers of HFD-fed rats. Further, the increased expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) composition such as CYP2E1 and CYP4A was also suppressed.Data suggest that HC-EA extract might act by regulating the AMPK-dependent pathway and related mediators and might be used in treating obesity-related  diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713129>Short Chain  Acids, pancreatic dysfunction and type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>The microbiota living in gut influence the immune response, metabolism, mood and behavior. The diet plays a pivotal role in maintaining healthy gut microbiota composition and its fermentation leads to production of Short Chain  Acids (SCFAs) mainly , propionate and butyrate. During pancreatic dysfunction, insulin mediated suppression of glucagon is impaired leading to uncontrolled glucose production by  and state of hyperglycemia. Insulin and glucagon balance is as important as insulin sensitivity which is reduced during Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP1) produced by Intestinal epithelial cells regulates insulin and glucagon secretion directly via GLP1 receptor on pancreatic cells or via nervous system. But half-life period of GLP1 is very short i.e. about 2 min, after which it is cleaved and inactivated. SCFAs are well documented to induce GLP1 but its direct effect on pancreatic dysfunction has not been reported. This review opens a new avenue to study the role of SCFAs as treatment to pancreatic dysfunction and T2D.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to answer this paradox by investigating the effects of fermentable and non-fermentable fibers on obesity induced by high-fat diet in gnotobiotic C3H/HeOuJ mice colonized with a simplified human microbiota. Mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented either with 10% cellulose (non-fermentable) or inulin (fermentable) for 6 weeks. Feeding the inulin diet resulted in an increased diet digestibility and reduced feces energy, compared to the cellulose diet with no differences in food intake, suggesting an increased intestinal energy extraction from inulin. However, we observed no increase in body fat/weight. The additional energy provided by the inulin diet led to an increased bacterial proliferation in this group. Supplementation of inulin resulted further in significantly elevated concentrations of total SCFA in cecum and portal vein plasma, with a reduced cecal :propionate ratio. Hepatic expression of genes involved in lipogenesis (Fasn, Gpam) and  acid elongation/desaturation (Scd1, Elovl3, Elovl6, Elovl5, Fads1 and Fads2) were decreased in inulin-fed animals. Accordingly, plasma and  phospholipid composition were changed between the different feeding groups. Concentrations of omega-3 and odd-chain  acids were increased in inulin-fed mice, whereas omega-6  acids were reduced. Taken together, these data indicate that, during this short-term feeding, inulin has mainly positive effects on the lipid metabolism, which could cause beneficial effects during obesity development in long-term studies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The microbiome has circadian rhythmicity and helps the host circadian clock function. We investigated the effect of SCFA or fibre-containing diets on circadian clock phase adjustment in mouse peripheral tissues (, kidney, and submandibular gland). Initially, caecal SCFA concentrations, particularly  and butyrate, induced significant day-night differences at high concentrations during the active period, which were correlated with lower caecal pH. By monitoring luciferase activity correlated with the clock gene Period2 in vivo, we found that oral administration of mixed SCFA (, butyrate, and propionate) and an organic acid (lactate), or single administration of each SCFA or lactate for three days, caused phase changes in the peripheral clocks with stimulation timing dependency. However, this effect was not detected in cultured fibroblasts or cultured  slices with SCFA applied to the culture medium, suggesting SCFA-induced indirect modulation of circadian clocks in vivo. Finally, cellobiose-containing diets facilitated SCFA production and refeeding-induced peripheral clock entrainment. SCFA oral gavage and prebiotic supplementation can facilitate peripheral clock adjustment, suggesting prebiotics as novel therapeutic candidates for misalignment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574320>Fecal SCFAs and SCFA-producing bacteria in gut microbiome of human NAFLD as a putative link to systemic T-cell activation and advanced disease.</a></h2><p>Intestinal microbiota and their metabolites (e.g. short-chain  acids (SCFAs)) may influence nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD).The objective of this article is to analyze gut bacterial diversity together with fecal SCFA concentrations and immunophenotyping of peripheral blood in histology-proven NAFLD patients.Thirty-two NAFLD patients (14 nonalcoholic  (NAFL), 18 nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)) and 27 healthy controls (HCs)) were included in this study. Bacterial communities in feces were profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of the V3-V4 region. Fecal SCFA levels were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.NASH patients were characterized by higher abundance of Fusobacteria and Fusobacteriaceae compared to NAFL and HCs. Conforming to our finding that NAFLD patients had higher fecal  and propionate levels, taxonomical differences of fecal bacteria were dominated by SCFA-producing bacteria. Higher fecal propionate and  levels were associated with lower resting regulatory T-cells (rTregs) (CD4+CD45RA+CD25++) as well as higher Th17/rTreg ratio in peripheral blood as immunological characteristics of NASH patients.NASH patients are characterized by a different gut microbiome composition with higher fecal SCFA levels and higher abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria in NAFLD. These changes are associated with immunological features of disease progression.

Oxidative stress is reported to play an important role in lead -induced  injury.This study was carried out to investigate the role of ethanol extract of  in protecting against lead -induced hepatotoxicity in male mice.The sample used fifty male mice which were divided into five groups: negative control (mice were given daily with Aquadest); positive control (mice were given daily with lead  20 mg/kg body weight (BW) orally once in a day for 21 days); and the treatment group (mice were given  extracts 200 mg, 400 mg, and 800 mg/kg BW orally once in a day for 25 days, and on the 4 day, were given lead  20 mg/kg BW 1 h after  extract administration for 21 days). On day 25, the levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measured. The data of SGOT, SGPT, ALP, MDA, SOD, and GPx were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, followed by least significant difference test.The results showed that oral administration of lead  20 mg/kg BW for 21 days resulted in a significant increase in SGOT, SGPT, ALP, and MDA levels. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in SOD and GPx levels. Treatment with  extracts of 800 mg/kg BW but not with 200 mg/kg BW and 400 mg/kg BW significantly ( < 0.05) decreased the elevated SGPT, SGOT, ALP, and MDA levels as compared to positive control group. Treatment with  extracts of 800 mg/kg BW also showed a significant increase in SOD and GPx levels as compared to positive control group. Treating mice with lead  showed different histopathological changes such as loss of the normal structure of hepatic cells, blood congestion, and  degeneration whereas animals treated with lead  and  extracts showed an improvement in these changes and the tissue appeared with normal structures.It can be concluded that  extracts could be a potent natural product and can provide a promising hepatoprotective effect against lead -induced hepatotoxicity in mice.In summary, Oxidative stress reported to play an important role in lead  induced  injury. The lead  treatment significantly increased the SGOT, SGPT, ALP, MDA, and decreased the antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GPx) in . The inhibition of antioxidant enzymes will increase free radicals in  tissues and might induce  injury in mice. The presence of ethanol extract of  with lead  showed protective effects as attenuating lead  against its  toxicity, and this may be due to the activity of ethanol extract of  as antioxidant. The antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GPx) were increased, and MDA, SGOT, SGPT, ALP were decreased after ethanol extract of  administration. The enzymatic activities (SOD and GPx) and MDA in mice can be used as biomarkers of heavy metal toxicity such as lead . Histopathological view of  sections in the lead  treated group showed the  damage, as compared to the negative control group. However, administration of ethanol extract of  significantly improved the histopathological in  of lead -treated mice. From the results of this study we concluded that the ethanol extract of  could be a potent natural product provide a promising protective effect against lead  induced  toxicity in mice. : SGOT: Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase, SGPT: Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase, ALP: Alkaline Phosphatase, MDA: Malondialdehyde, SOD: Superoxide Dismutase, GPx: Glutathione Peroxidase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25533197>Ketone body production is differentially altered in steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in obese humans.</a></h2><p>Levels of ketone bodies have been reported to be both increased and decreased in individuals with non-alcoholic  disease.

Thus, the development of novel drugs is urgently needed to control obesity related diseases.Here, we investigated the protective role of Lavatera critica (LC), a green vegetable, in male C57BL/6J mice fed with high fat (HF) diet for 10 weeks to induce hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative cellular damage.After oral administration of chloroform (CFLC), ethyl  (EFLC), or methanol (MFLC) fractions of Lavatera critica to the HF group, EALC alone significantly reduced the activities of hepatic markers such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST); moreover, the results showed that 50 mg/kg dose has the maximum activity. Thus, this active dose of EFLC was used for further analysis. Moreover, EFLC reduced the level of hepatic triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), free  acids (FFA), and prevented further increase in the body weight. Intriguingly, EFLC treatment also reversed the mRNA expression of  acid oxidative genes, such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACO), and  acid synthesis genes such as  acid synthase (FAS), sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Furthermore, EFLC treatment also decreased the production of oxidative stress biomarkers, such as conjugated diene (CD), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH), and significantly enhanced the level of enzymatic antioxidants, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), as well as non-enzymatic antioxidants, such as reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamin C, and vitamin E in the .Taken together, we conclude that EFLC has a protective effect against HF diet induced hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative cellular damage through the regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis genes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In small ruminants pemphigus foliaceus has rarely been described and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, little information is available about successful treatment in sheep.This case report describes a Berrichon du Cher ram with the presumed diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus.The ram was treated with methylprednisolone  40 mg at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg in one subcuticular injection at four week intervals over a one year period, with regular observation of clinical parameters. Four months after treatment was initiated the haematological parameters showed lymphopenia and leukopenia; some enzyme activities were substantially increased.The ram's dermatological condition improved to the point of complete healing of the affected skin. The ram was discharged in good condition. No adverse effects, except an elevation of some enzymes associated with  function, were observed. At postmortem examination moderate  syndrome was the only abnormality found.This case report demonstrated that long term therapy with methylprednisolone  in a sheep with pemphigus foliaceus did not have a negative effect on clinical parameters. Nevertheless, due to the extended statutory withdrawal period resulting from the regular administration of glucocorticoids, such a therapeutic option must be critically assessed in food producing animals.© 2017 ESVD and ACVD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27799068>Recurrent purpura due to alcohol-related Schamberg's disease and its association with serum immunoglobulins: a longitudinal observation of a heavy drinker.</a></h2><p>It is unusual for purpura to emerge as a result of drinking alcohol. Such a peculiarity was observed in a 55-year-old man with a 30-year history of heavy alcohol use.The Caucasian patient was studied for 11 years during several detoxification treatments. During the last 2 years of that period, purpuric rashes were newly observed. The asymptomatic purpura was limited to both lower limbs, self-limiting with abstinence, and reoccurring swiftly with alcohol relapse. This sequence was observed six times, suggesting a causative role of alcohol or its metabolites. A skin biopsy revealed histological features of purpura pigmentosa progressiva (termed Schamberg's disease). Additionally, alcoholic  disease markedly elevated serum immunoglobulins (immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin E), activated T-lymphocytes, and increased C-reactive protein. In addition, moderate combined (cellular and humoral) immunodeficiency was found. Unlike the patient's immunoglobulin A level, his serum immunoglobulin E level fell in the first days of abstinence, which corresponded to the time of purpura decline. Systemic vasculitis and clotting disorders were excluded. The benign character of the purpura was supported by missing circulating immune complexes or complement activation. An alcohol provocation test with vinegar was followed by the development of fresh "cayenne pepper" spots characteristic of Schamberg's disease.This case report demonstrates that Schamberg's disease can be strongly related to alcohol intake, in our patient most likely as a late complication of severe alcoholism with alcoholic  disease.

However, implications of acetyl-CoA synthetase-2 in colorectal carcinoma may differ from other malignancies, because normal colonocytes use short-chain  acids as an energy source, which are supplied by fermentation of the intestinal flora. Here we analyzed acetyl-CoA synthetase-2 mRNA expression by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR in paired normal mucosa and tumor tissues of 12 colorectal carcinomas, and subsequently evaluated acetyl-CoA synthetase-2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry in 157 premalignant colorectal lesions, including 60 conventional adenomas and 97 serrated polyps, 1,106 surgically resected primary colorectal carcinomas, and 23 metastatic colorectal carcinomas in the . In reverse-transcription quantitative PCR analysis, acetyl-CoA synthetase-2 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared with corresponding normal mucosa tissues. In acetyl-CoA synthetase-2 immunohistochemistry analysis, all 157 colorectal polyps showed moderate-to-strong expression of acetyl-CoA synthetase-2. However, cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA synthetase-2 expression was downregulated (acetyl-CoA synthetase-2 low expression) in 771 (69.7%) of 1,106 colorectal carcinomas and 21 (91.3%) of 23 metastatic lesions. The colorectal carcinomas with acetyl-CoA synthetase-2-low expression were significantly associated with advanced TNM stage, poor differentiation, and frequent tumor budding. Regarding the molecular aspect, acetyl-CoA synthetase-2-low expression exhibited a tendency of frequent KRT7 expression and decreased KRT20 and CDX2 expression. In survival analysis, acetyl-CoA synthetase-2-low expression was an independent prognostic factor for poor 5-year progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.79; P=0.01). In conclusion, these findings suggest that downregulation of acetyl-CoA synthetase-2 expression is a metabolic hallmark of tumor progression and aggressive behavior in colorectal carcinoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28290602>AJS1669, a novel small-molecule muscle glycogen synthase activator, improves glucose metabolism and reduces body fat mass in mice.</a></h2><p>Impaired glycogen synthesis and turnover are common in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. As glycogen synthase (GS) is a key enzyme involved in the synthetic process, it presents a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we identified a novel, potent and orally available GS activator AJS1669 {sodium 2-[[5-[[4-(4,5-difluoro-2-methylsulfanyl-phenyl)phenoxy] methyl]furan-2-carbonyl]-(2-furylmethyl)amino] }. In vitro, we performed a glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) activation assay for screening GS activators and identified that the activity of AJS1669 was further potentiated in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). In vivo, we used ob/ob mice to evaluate the novel anti-diabetic effects of AJS1669 by measuring basal blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance and body fat mass index. Repeated administration of AJS1669 over 4 weeks reduced blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in ob/ob mice. AJS1669 also improved glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner, and decreased body fat mass. The mRNA levels of genes involved in mitochondrial  acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis were elevated in skeletal muscle tissue following AJS1669 treatment. Hepatic tissue of treated mice also exhibited elevated expression of genes associated with  acid oxidation. In contrast to ob/ob mice, in C57Bl/6 mice AJS1669 administration did not alter body weight or reduce glucose levels. These results demonstrate that pharmacological agents that activate GYS1, the main GS subtype found in skeletal muscle, have potential for use as novel treatments for diabetes that improve glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25380412>Discovery and optimization of an azetidine chemical series as a free  acid receptor 2 (FFA2) antagonist: from hit to clinic.</a></h2><p>FFA2, also called GPR43, is a G-protein coupled receptor for short chain  acids which is involved in the mediation of inflammatory responses. A class of azetidines was developed as potent FFA2 antagonists. Multiparametric optimization of early hits with moderate potency and suboptimal ADME properties led to the identification of several compounds with nanomolar potency on the receptor combined with excellent pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters.

Carboxylesterase (CES) has an important role in metabolism of irinotecan to its active metabolite, SN-38, in human . The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether CES activity was altered in ESKD patients.The present study investigated the effects of uremic serum, uremic toxins, and  acids on the hydrolysis of irinotecan and a typical CES substrate, p-nitrophenyl  (PNPA), in human  microsomes. Normal and uremic serum samples were deproteinized by treatment with methanol were used in the present study.The present study showed that both normal and uremic serum significantly inhibited CES-mediated metabolism of both irinotecan and PNPA. The inhibition by uremic serum was weaker than that by normal serum, suggesting that CES activity may be higher in ESKD patients. Although four uremic toxins did not affect PNPA metabolism, arachidonic acid inhibited it. There was no difference in inhibitory effect of PNPA metabolism between both mixtures of seven  acids used at concentrations equivalent to those present in 10% normal or uremic serum. Interestingly, those mixtures had a more pronounced effect than either 10% normal or uremic serum.The present study showed that the inhibition of CES activity by uremic serum was weaker than that by normal serum, suggesting that an increase in maximum plasma concentration of SN-38 in cancer patients with ESKD can be attributed to an accelerated CES-mediated irinotecan hydrolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27773935>Alisol B 23- protects against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice via farnesoid X receptor activation.</a></h2><p>Alisol B 23- (AB23A) is a natural triterpenoid isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine rhizoma alismatis, which exhibits a number of pharmacological activities, including anti-hepatitis virus, anti-cancer and antibacterial effects. In this study we examined whether AB23A protected against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in mice, and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects. NASH was induced in mice fed a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 4 weeks. The mice were simultaneously treated with AB23A (15, 30, and 60 mg·kg·d, ig) for 4 weeks. On the last day, blood samples and livers were collected. Serum  functional enzymes, inflammatoru markers were assessed. The livers were histologically examined using H&E, Oil Red O, Masson's trichrome and Sirius Red staining. Mouse primary hepatocytes were used for in vitro experiments. The mechanisms underlying AB23A protection were analyzed using siRNA, qRT-PCR, and Western blot assays. AB23A treatment significantly and dose-dependently decreased the elevated levels of serum ALT and AST in MCD diet-fed mice. Furthermore, AB23A treatment significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation, inflammatory cell infiltration and hepatic fibrosis in the mice. AB23A-induced decreases in serum and hepatic lipids were related to decreased hepatic lipogenesis through decreasing hepatic levels of SREBP-1c, FAS, ACC1 and SCD1 and increased lipid metabolism via inducing PPARα, CPT1α, ACADS and LPL. The reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration corresponded to deceased serum levels of mKC and MCP-1 and decreased hepatic gene expression of MCP-1 and VCAM-1. The reduction in hepatic fibrosis was correlated with decreased hepatic gene expression of fibrosis markers. The protective effects of AB23A were FXR-dependent, because treatment with the FXR agonist CDCA mimicked AB23A-induced hepato-protection in the mice, whereas co-administration of FXR antagonist guggulsterone abrogated AB23A-induced hepato-protection. In mouse primary hepatocytes, FXR gene silencing abrogated AB23A-induced changes in gene expression of Apo C-II, CPT1α, ACADS and LPL. AB23A produces protective effects against NASH in mice via FXR activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28724959>Hepatic metabolic effects of Curcuma longa extract supplement in high-fructose and saturated fat fed rats.</a></h2><p>The metabolic effects of an oral supplementation with a Curcuma longa extract, at a dose nutritionally relevant with common human use, on hepatic metabolism in rats fed a high fructose and saturated  acid (HFS) diet was evaluated. High-resolution magic-angle spinning NMR and GC/MS in combination with multivariate analysis have been employed to characterize the NMR metabolite profiles and  acid composition of  tissue respectively. The results showed a clear discrimination between HFS groups and controls involving metabolites such as glucose, glycogen, amino acids, , choline, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and β-hydroxybutyrate as well as an increase of MUFAs and a decrease of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs. Although the administration of CL did not counteract deleterious effects of the HFS diet, some metabolites, namely some n-6 PUFA and n-3 PUFA, and betaine were found to increase significantly in  samples from rats having received extract of curcuma compared to those fed the HFS diet alone. This result suggests that curcuminoids may affect the transmethylation pathway and/or osmotic regulation.

Highest amounts of ethanol were produced by S. cerevisiae, L. fermentum, and W. confusa on glucose and by S. cerevisiae and W. confusa on fructose. Due to mannitol-dehydrogenase expressed in L. fermentum, ethanol production on fructose was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced. Pyruvate and citrate, two potential electron acceptors for regeneration of NAD(+)/NADP(+), drastically reduced ethanol production with  produced instead in L. fermentum grown on glucose and W. confusa grown on glucose and fructose, respectively. In fecal slurries prepared from feces of four overweight volunteers, ethanol was found to be produced upon addition of fructose. Addition of A. caccae, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, as well as citrate and pyruvate, respectively, abolished ethanol production. However, addition of W. confusa resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) increased production of ethanol. These results indicate that microorganisms like W. confusa, a hetero-fermentative, mannitol-dehydrogenase negative lactic acid bacterium, may promote NAFLD through ethanol produced from sugar fermentation, while other intestinal bacteria and homo- and hetero-fermentative but mannitol-dehydrogenase positive lactic acid bacteria may not promote NAFLD.

Ethanol metabolism triggers oxidative stress, altered immune function, and gut dysbiosis. The gut microbiome is known to contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, and disturbances are associated with pathology. A consequence of gut dysbiosis is also alterations in its metabolic and fermentation byproducts. The gut microbiota ferments undigested dietary polysaccharides to yield short-chain  acids, predominantly , propionate, and butyrate. Butyrate has many biological mechanisms of action including anti-inflammatory and immunoprotective effects, and its depletion is associated with intestinal injury. We previously showed that butyrate protects gut- injury during ethanol exposure. While the intestine is the largest immune organ in the body, little is known regarding the effects of ethanol on intestinal immune function. This work is aimed at investigating the effects of butyrate supplementation, in the form of the structured triglyceride tributyrin, on intestinal innate immune responses and oxidative stress following chronic-binge ethanol exposure in mice. Our work suggests that tributyrin supplementation preserved immune responses and reduced oxidative stress in the proximal colon during chronic-binge ethanol exposure. Our results also indicate a possible involvement of tributyrin in maintaining the integrity of intestinal villi vasculature disrupted by chronic-binge ethanol exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30098126>The effects of dietary supplementation with inulin and inulin-propionate ester on hepatic steatosis in adults with non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>The short chain  acid (SCFA) propionate, produced through fermentation of dietary fibre by the gut microbiota, has been shown to alter hepatic metabolic processes that reduce lipid storage. We aimed to investigate the impact of raising colonic propionate production on hepatic steatosis in adults with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Eighteen adults were randomized to receive 20 g/d of an inulin-propionate ester (IPE), designed to deliver propionate to the colon, or an inulin control for 42 days in a parallel design. The change in intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL) following the supplementation period was not different between the groups (P = 0.082), however, IHCL significantly increased within the inulin-control group (20.9% ± 2.9% to 26.8% ± 3.9%; P = 0.012; n = 9), which was not observed within the IPE group (22.6% ± 6.9% to 23.5% ± 6.8%; P = 0.635; n = 9). The predominant SCFA from colonic fermentation of inulin is , which, in a background of NAFLD and a hepatic metabolic profile that promotes fat accretion, may provide surplus lipogenic substrate to the .

Prebiotics, such as certain oligosaccharides, are a useful solution to this problem, but the combinational benefits of these oligosaccharides have not been evaluated. This study investigated the benefits of oligosaccharide combinations and screened for an optimal combination of oligosaccharides to promote healthy gut microbiota of formula-fed infants. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to assess the bifidogenic effects of lactulose (LAC) alone and LAC combined with raffinose (RAF) and/or galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS), using a mixed culture model and neonatal mice orally administered with these oligosaccharides and Bifidobacterium breve. In the in vitro culture model, the combination of the three oligosaccharides (LAC-RAF-GOS) significantly increased cell numbers of B. breve and Bifidobacterium longum (P<0·05) compared with either LAC alone or the combination of two oligosaccharides, and resulted in the production of SCFA under anaerobic conditions. In the in vivo experiment, the LAC-RAF-GOS combination significantly increased cell numbers of B. breve and Bacteroidetes in the large intestinal content (P<0·05) and increased  concentrations in the caecal content and serum of neonatal mice. Genes related to metabolism and immune responses were differentially expressed in the  and large intestine of mice administered with LAC-RAF-GOS.

Adult mice lacking ACSS2 appear phenotypically normal but exhibit reduced tumor burdens in mouse models of  cancer. The normal physiological functions of this alternate pathway of acetyl-CoA synthesis remain unclear, however. Here, we reveal that mice lacking ACSS2 exhibit a significant reduction in body weight and hepatic steatosis in a diet-induced obesity model. ACSS2 deficiency reduces dietary lipid absorption by the intestine and also perturbs repartitioning and utilization of triglycerides from adipose tissue to the  due to lowered expression of lipid transporters and  acid oxidation genes. In this manner, ACSS2 promotes the systemic storage or metabolism of fat according to the fed or fasted state through the selective regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism.

Animal and human studies have linked small molecule metabolites produced by commensal bacteria in the gut contribute to not only intestinal inflammation, but also to hepatic inflammation. These immunomodulatory metabolites are capable of engaging host cellular receptors, and may mediate the observed association between gut dysbiosis and NAFLD. This review focuses on the effects and potential mechanisms of three specific classes of metabolites that synthesized or modified by gut bacteria: short chain  acids, amino acid catabolites, and bile acids. In particular, we discuss their role as ligands for cell surface and nuclear receptors regulating metabolic and inflammatory pathways in the intestine and . Studies reveal that the metabolites can both agonize and antagonize their cognate receptors to reduce or exacerbate  steatosis and inflammation, and that the effects are metabolite- and context-specific. Further studies are warranted to more comprehensively understand bacterial metabolite-mediated gut- in NAFLD.

Geranium molle L. has been used in the Portuguese folk medicine for the treatment of various ailments including cancer but, unlike many of the species from the Geranium genus, its phytochemical characterization and biological activity are virtually unexplored. In this study a G. molle sample from Trás-os-Montes, north-eastern Portugal, was chemically characterized regarding nutritional value, free sugars, organic acids,  acids and tocopherols, and several aqueous (decoction, infusion) and organic (n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl , acetone, methanol) extracts of the plant were assessed for their bioactive properties. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by means of the free radicals scavenging activity, reducing power and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The cytotoxicity of the different extracts was assessed in vitro against several human cancer cell lines (breast, lung, cervical and hepatocellular carcinomas) and, additionally, their hepatotoxicity was evaluated using a porcine  primary cell culture. G. molle was shown to be rich in carbohydrates and proteins, providing tocopherols and essential  acids. Amongst the various extracts, the acetone extract was found to have the highest content of phenolic compounds (mainly ellagitannins, but also some flavone and flavonol glycosides) as well as the highest antioxidant and cytotoxic activities.

We investigated the distribution and function of candidate SCFA transporters in rat duodenum. The Na(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transporter-1 (SMCT1) was localized to the brush border, whereas the pH-dependent monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 and MCT4 were localized to the duodenocyte basolateral membrane. In Ussing chambered duodenal mucosa, luminal  dose-dependently increased short-circuit current (Isc) in the presence of serosal bumetanide and indomethacin by a luminal Na(+)-dependent, ouabain-sensitive mechanism. The Isc response was inhibited dose-dependently by the SMCT1 nonsubstrate inhibitor ibuprofen, consistent with net electrogenic absorption of  via SMCT1. Other SCFAs and lactate also increased Isc. Furthermore, duodenal loop perfusion of  increased portal venous  concentration, inhibited by coperfusion of ibuprofen or a MCT inhibitor. Luminal  perfusion increased duodenal HCO3 (-) secretion via capsaicin-sensitive afferent nerve activation and cyclooxygenase activity, consistent with absorption-mediated HCO3 (-) secretion. These results suggest that absorption of luminal SCFA via SMCT1 and MCTs increases duodenal HCO3 (-) secretion. In addition to SCFA sensing via free  acid receptors, the presence of rapid duodenal SCFA absorption may be important for the suppression of luminal bacterial colonization and implicated in the generation of functional dyspepsia due to bacterial overgrowth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29502000>Dietary grape seed proanthocyanidin extract regulates metabolic disturbance in rat  exposed to lead associated with PPARα signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Lead, a pervasive environmental hazard worldwide, causes a wide range of physiological and biochemical destruction, including metabolic dysfunction.

However, the relative plasma-cholesterol-lowering activity of individual SCFAs and the underlying mechanisms by which SCFAs decrease plasma cholesterol remain largely unknown. The present study was done to compare the plasma-cholesterol-lowering potencies of four common SCFAs with 2-5 carbons and to investigate their interactions with gene expressions of key regulatory factors involved in cholesterol metabolism. For 6 weeks, five groups of male Golden hamsters were fed either a control high-cholesterol diet (HCD) or one of the four experimental HCDs containing 0.5 mol of  (Ac), propionate (Pr), butyrate (Bu), or valerate (Va) per kilogram of the diet.

MUC2 deficiency results in impaired epithelial barrier function, imbalance in gut microbiota, and spontaneous colitis. Probiotics have been shown to have a protective effect against colitis. In this study we used Muc2 mucin-deficient (Muc2) and Muc2 littermates to test whether the probiotic mixture VSL#3 requires an intact mucin barrier to exert its beneficial effect. VSL#3 alone reduced basal colonic proinflammatory cytokine levels and improved epithelial barrier function in Muc2 animals. Similarly, in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, VSL#3 dampened the proinflammatory chemokines KC, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and upregulated the tissue regeneration growth factors transforming growth factor-β, fibroblast growth factor-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which accelerated resolution of colitis symptoms in Muc2 animals. Importantly, improved colonic health in VSL#3-treated animals was associated with attenuated reactive oxygen species production by peritoneal macrophages, restoration of antimicrobial peptide gene expression in the small intestine, and increased abundance of bacterial commensals in the gut. The beneficial effects of VSL#3 in Muc2 animals were mediated by , an important short-chain  acid produced by gut bacteria.

Zinc ameliorated excess copper-induced impairment of autophagic flux and MDB-like inclusion body formation via the maintenance of ER homeostasis. Furthermore, zinc also ameliorated free  acid-induced impairment of autophagic flux.

Metabolic signals derived from dietary intake or secreted from adipose tissue, gut, and  contribute to energy homeostasis. Recent metabolomic studies identified novel metabolites and enlarged our knowledge on classic metabolites. This review summarizes the evidence of their roles as mediators of interorgan crosstalk and regulators of insulin sensitivity and energy metabolism. Circulating lipids such as free  acids, , and palmitoleate from adipose tissue and short-chain  acids from the gut effectively act on  and skeletal muscle. Intracellular lipids such as diacylglycerols and sphingolipids can serve as lipotoxins by directly inhibiting insulin action in muscle and . In contrast,  acid esters of hydroxy  acids have been recently shown to exert a series of beneficial effects. Also, ketoacids are gaining interest as potent modulators of insulin action and mitochondrial function. Finally, branched-chain amino acids not only predict metabolic diseases, but also inhibit insulin signaling. Here, we focus on the metabolic crosstalk in humans, which regulates insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, skeletal muscle, , and adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27266874>Detection of differentially expressed candidate genes for a  QTL on mouse chromosome 12.</a></h2><p>The SMXA-5 mouse is an animal model of high-fat diet-induced . The major QTL for , Fl1sa on chromosome 12, was identified in a SM/J × SMXA-5 intercross. The SMXA-5 genome consists of the SM/J and A/J genomes, and the A/J allele of Fl1sa is a -susceptibility allele. The existence of the responsible genes for  within Fl1sa was confirmed in A/J-12(SM) consomic mice. The aim of this study was to identify candidate genes for Fl1sa, and to investigate whether the identified genes affect the lipid metabolism.A/J-12(SM) mice showed a significantly lower  triglyceride content compared to A/J mice when fed the high-fat diet for 7 weeks. We detected differences in the accumulation of  lipids in response to the high-fat diet between A/J and A/J-12(SM) consomic mice. To identify candidate genes for Fl1sa, we performed DNA microarray analysis using the livers of A/J-12(SM) and A/J mice fed the high-fat diet. The mRNA levels of three genes (Iah1, Rrm2, Prkd1) in the chromosomal region of Fl1sa were significantly different between the strains. Iah1 mRNA levels in the , kidney, and lung were significantly higher in A/J-12(SM) mice than in A/J mice. The hepatic Iah1 mRNA level in A/J-12(SM) mice was 3.2-fold higher than that in A/J mice. To examine the effect of Iah1 on hepatic lipid metabolism, we constructed a stable cell line expressing the mouse Iah1 protein in mouse hepatoma Hepa1-6 cells. Overexpression of Iah1 in Hepa1-6 cells suppressed the mRNA levels of Cd36 and Dgat2, which play important roles in triglyceride synthesis and lipid metabolism.These results demonstrated that Fl1sa on the proximal region of chromosome 12 affected  in mice on a high-fat diet. Iah1 (isoamyl -hydrolyzing esterase 1 homolog) was identified as one of the candidate genes for Fl1sa.

GMP is a putative prebiotic based on extensive glycosylation with sialic acid, galactose, and galactosamine. Our objective was to determine the prebiotic properties of GMP by characterizing cecal and fecal microbiota populations, short-chain  acids (SCFA), and immune responses. Weanling PKU (Pah(enu2)) and wild-type (WT) C57Bl/6 mice were fed isoenergetic AA, GMP, or casein diets for 8 wk. The cecal content and feces were collected for microbial DNA extraction to perform 16S microbiota analysis by Ion Torrent PGM sequencing. SCFA were determined by gas chromatography, plasma cytokines via a Bio-Plex Pro assay, and splenocyte T cell populations by flow cytometry. Changes in cecal and fecal microbiota are primarily diet dependent. The GMP diet resulted in a reduction from 30-35 to 7% in Proteobacteria, genera Desulfovibrio, in both WT and PKU mice with genotype-dependent changes in Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes. Cecal concentrations of the SCFA , propionate, and butyrate were increased with GMP. The percentage of stimulated spleen cells producing interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was significantly reduced in mice fed GMP compared with casein. In summary, plasma concentrations of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-2 were reduced in mice fed GMP. GMP is a prebiotic based on reduction in Desulfovibrio, increased SCFA, and lower indexes of inflammation compared with casein and AA diets in mice. Functional foods made with GMP may be beneficial in the management of PKU, obesity, and IBD.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26115288>Effect of concentrate feeder design on performance, eating and animal behavior, welfare, ruminal health, and carcass quality in Holstein bulls fed high-concentrate diets.</a></h2><p>A total of 240 Holstein bulls (121 ± 2.0 kg initial BW; 99 ± 1.0 d of age), from 2 consecutive fattening cycles, were randomly allocated in 1 of 6 pens and assigned to 1 of the 3 treatments consisting of different concentrate feeder designs: a control feeder with 4 feeding spaces (CF), a feeder with less concentrate capacity (CFL), and a single-space feeder with lateral protections (SF). Each pen had a straw feeder and a drinker. All animals were fed a high-concentrate diet for ad libitum intake. Concentrate consumption was recorded daily using a computerized feeder, straw consumption was recorded weekly, and BW was recorded every 14 d. Animal behavior was registered on d 1, 3, 5, 8, and 14 and every 28 d by scan sampling. Eating behavior at concentrate feeders was filmed on d 12, 125, and 206. On d 7, 120, and 204, samples of rumen contents were collected for measurement of pH and VFA and blood samples were obtained to analyze NEFA, haptoglobin, glucose, and insulin. Animals were slaughtered after 223 d, and HCW and lesions of the rumen wall and  were recorded. The accumulative concentrate consumption per animal tended (P = 0.09) to be greater with CF than with CFL and SF. Also, CV of concentrate consumption was greater (P < 0.01) for SF than for CF or CFL. However, feeder design did not influence the other performance and carcass data. Also, no differences among treatments in rumen wall evaluation and  abscesses were observed. At 7 and 204 d of study, SF bulls had greater (P < 0.05) rumen pH compared with CF and CFL bulls. On d 7, the  to propionate ratio from SF was greater (P < 0.05) than for CFL or CF. At d 7, NEFA of SF were greater (P < 0.05) compared with CF and CFL. Bulls fed with CF have the greatest (P < 0.01) concentrate disappearance velocity followed by bulls fed with CFL and finally by bulls fed with SF, and this was associated with different feeding behaviors. Bulls on SF spent more time (P < 0.05) eating straw and exhibited fewer (P < 0.05) displacements at concentrate feeder than CF and CFL bulls. The CFL bulls exhibited (P < 0.01) more attempted mounts and tended (P = 0.10) to exhibit more completed mounts than CF bulls. In conclusion, both alternative feeder designs (CFL and SF) are good strategies to reduce total concentrate consumption without impairing performance, rumen health, or animal welfare in Holstein bulls fed high-concentrate diets. However, at the beginning, there was evidence that animals fed using SF had problems with adaptation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28726994>CELL BIOLOGY SYMPOSIUM: Practical application of the basic aspects of GLUT4 membrane trafficking and insulin signaling on issues related to animal agriculture.</a></h2><p>Because of the relatively short lifespans of beef cattle, membrane trafficking in relation to inflammation is not considered important unless it overtly affects productivity. However, glucose uptake and utilization is important for adipose tissue development in beef cattle, and increasing glucose utilization in intramuscular adipose tissue can increase carcass quality. Research from the 1980s demonstrated a lack of insulin sensitivity in isolated bovine adipocytes and adipose tissue explants incubated in vitro. Insulin did not stimulate glucose or  incorporation into  acids, nor did it increase concentrations of glycolytic intermediates in bovine adipose tissue incubated with exogenous glucose. Specific binding of [I] iodoinsulin and insulin degradation in bovine isolated adipocytes was low to non-detectable. These early studies indicated that insulin-dependent receptor-mediated signaling was less important in bovine adipose tissue than in adipose tissues of humans, swine, or laboratory species. More recent research demonstrated that glucose transporter protein 4 (GLUT4) expression in muscle and adipose tissue declines markedly after birth in calves, indicating the development of insulin resistance as cattle transition from suckling to functional ruminants. Insulin resistance is important in dairy cattle, causing ketosis and . Consistent with this, subcutaneous adipose tissue expression decreases 50% following parturition in dairy cattle, although expression of genes associated with insulin responsiveness (, , and ) is up-regulated by 21 d postpartum. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of insulin resistance in beef and dairy cattle would increase animal health and thereby improve productivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30267975>Sodium  and androgen receptor blockade improve gestational androgen excess-induced deteriorated glucose homeostasis and antioxidant defenses in rats: roles of adenosine deaminase and xanthine oxidase activities.</a></h2><p>Nutritional challenges and androgen excess have been implicated in the development of gestational diabetes and poor fetal outcome, but the mechanisms are not well delineated. The effects of short chain  acid (SCFA) on glucose dysmetabolism and poor fetal outcome induced by gestational androgen excess is also not known. We tested the hypothesis that blockade of androgen receptor (AR) and suppression of late gestational androgen excess prevents glucose dysmetabolism and poor fetal outcome through suppression of adenosine deaminase (ADA)/xanthine oxidase (XO) pathway. Twenty-four pregnant Wistar rats were treated (sc) with olive oil, testosterone propionate (0.5 mg/kg) singly or in combination with SCFA (sodium ; 200 mg/kg; p.o.) or AR blocker (flutamide; 7.5 mg/kg; p.o.) between gestational days 14 and 19. The results showed that late gestational androgen excess led to glucose deregulation, poor fetal outcome, increased plasma and hepatic free  acid and lactate dehydrogenase,  function marker enzymes, malondialdehyde, uric acid, ADA and XO activities. Conversely, gestational androgen excess resulted in reduced body weight gain, visceral adiposity, plasma and hepatic anti-oxidant defenses (glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione/glutathione disulphide ratio, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, adenosine and nitric oxide). However, all these effects were ameliorated by either sodium  or flutamide treatment. The study demonstrates that suppression of testosterone by SCFA or AR blockade protects against glucose deregulation and poor fetal outcome by improvement of anti-oxidant defenses and replenishment of hepatic oxidative capacity through suppression of ADA/XO pathway. Hence, utility of SCFA should be encouraged for prevention of glucose dysmetabolism and poor fetal outcome.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, it has been reported that GPR120 promotes the cell motile activity and angiogenesis in cancer cells. In this study, we assessed the role of GPR120 in the cell motile activity induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) in rat  epithelial WB-F344 cells. Cells were treated with TPA at a concentration of 5 nM for 72 h. The expression level of the Gpr120 gene was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis. Cells treated with TPA showed the elevated Gpr120 expression, in comparison with untreated cells. In cell motility assays, the cell motile activity of cells treated with TPA was significantly higher than that of untreated cells. To confirm whether GPR120 is involved in the cell motile activity mediated by TPA, we generated GPR120 knockdown cells from WB-F344 cells. The cell motile activity induced by TPA was significantly suppressed by GPR120 knockdown. These results suggest that GPR120 plays an important role in the cell motile activity induced by TPA in WB-F344 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28349418>Comparing the effects of different dietary organic acids on the growth, intestinal short-chain  acids, and  histopathology of red hybrid tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) and potential use of these as preservatives.</a></h2><p>Dietary organic acids are increasingly being investigated as a potential means of improving growth and nutrient utilization in aquatic animals. A 9-week study was performed to compare equal amounts (2%) of different organic acids (sodium butyrate, , propionate, or formate) on the growth, muscle proximate composition,  acid composition, cholesterol and lipid peroxidation, differential cell counts, plasma biochemistry, intestinal short-chain  acid (SCFA) level, and  histopathology to red hybrid tilapia (Oreochromis sp.)

The results of the first experiment showed no treatment effect to growth, feeding efficiencies, or muscle  acid composition, but all dietary organic acids significantly decreased intestinal SCFA. Dietary butyrate and propionate significantly decreased muscle lipid peroxidation compared to the control group, but the dietary formate treatment had the lowest lipid peroxidation compared to all treatments. Muscle crude protein and lipid in tilapia fed the formate diet were significantly lower and higher, respectively, and showed evidence of stress based on the differential cell counts, significantly higher plasma glucose and  glycogen, as well as inflammatory responses in the . Although a potential benefit of dietary organic acids was a reduction to lipid peroxidation, this could be accomplished post-harvest by direct additions to the meat. In addition, inclusions of butyrate and propionate to tilapia meat significantly decreased TMA, which might be a more cost-effective option to improve the shelf life of tilapia products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31219825>Microbiota and nonalcoholic  disease: promising prospects for clinical interventions?</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is becoming the most important cause of chronic  disease in Western countries but no pharmacological therapy is currently available.

However, previous studies have suggested that the interaction of hemodilution and vascular hyperpermeability induces tissue edema and an inflammatory response during CPB. In this study, we hypothesized the suppression of the systemic inflammatory response and tissue edema during CPB by a plasma substitute (hydroxyethyl starch [HES]). Rats (450-500 g) were divided into a SHAM group (n = 5), a Ringer's  CPB group (n = 7), and an HES CPB group (n = 7). In the Ringer's  group, the CPB circuit was primed with Ringer's  solution, and in the HES CPB group, it was primed with HES formulation (6% HES 130/0.4). Blood samples were collected before (baseline) and 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after initiation of CPB. Plasma cytokine levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10, and biochemical markers (lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, -type  acid-binding protein, and colloid osmotic pressure [COP]) were measured before and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the initiation of CPB. In the Ringer's  CPB group, the inflammatory cytokines and biochemical markers increased significantly during CPB compared with the SHAM group, but such increases were significantly suppressed in the HES CPB group. In addition, during CPB, it was possible to preserve normal plasma COP in the HES CPB group.

Here, we propose a hypothesis of how early mitochondrial adaptations for alcohol metabolism lead to ALD pathogenesis. Acutely, ethanol (EtOH) feeding causes a near doubling of hepatic EtOH metabolism and oxygen consumption within 2 to 3 hours. This swift increase in alcohol metabolism (SIAM) is an adaptive response to hasten metabolic elimination of both EtOH and its more toxic metabolite, acetaldehyde (AcAld). In association with SIAM, EtOH causes widespread hepatic mitochondrial depolarization (mtDepo), which stimulates oxygen consumption. In parallel, voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) in the mitochondrial outer membrane close. Together, VDAC closure and respiratory stimulation promote selective and more rapid oxidation of EtOH first to AcAld in the cytosol and then to nontoxic  in mitochondria, since membrane-permeant AcAld does not require VDAC to enter mitochondria. VDAC closure also inhibits mitochondrial  acid oxidation and ATP release, promoting steatosis and a decrease in cytosolic ATP. After acute EtOH, these changes revert as EtOH is eliminated with little hepatocellular cytolethality. mtDepo also stimulates mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). After chronic high EtOH exposure, the capacity to process depolarized mitochondria by mitophagy becomes compromised, leading to intra- and extracellular release of damaged mitochondria, mitophagosomes, and/or autolysosomes containing mitochondrial damage-associated molecular pattern (mtDAMP) molecules. mtDAMPs cause inflammasome activation and promote inflammatory and profibrogenic responses, causing hepatitis and fibrosis. We propose that persistence of mitochondrial responses to EtOH metabolism becomes a tipping point, which links initial adaptive EtOH metabolism to maladaptive changes initiating onset and progression of ALD.© 2018 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28876011>A study of the prebiotic-like effects of tomato juice consumption in rats with diet-induced non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota may play a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.

C57BL/6 mice (n 8 per group) were fed a standard diet either supplemented with t10c12-CLA (0·5 %, w/w) (intervention) or with no supplementation (control), daily for 8 weeks. Metabolic markers (serum glucose, leptin, insulin and TAG, and  TAG) were assessed by ELISA commercial kits, tissue long-chain  acids and caecal SCFA by GC, and microbial composition by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. Dietary t10c12-CLA significantly decreased visceral fat mass (P< 0·001), but did not affect body weight (intervention), when compared with no supplementation (control). Additionally, lipid mass and composition were affected by t10c12-CLA intake. Caecal , propionate and isobutyrate concentrations were higher (P< 0·05) in the t10c12-CLA-supplemented group than in the control group. The analysis of the microbiota composition following 8 weeks of t10c12-CLA supplementation revealed lower proportions of Firmicutes (P= 0·003) and higher proportions of Bacteroidetes (P= 0·027) compared with no supplementation. Furthermore, t10c12-CLA supplementation for 8 weeks significantly altered the gut microbiota composition, harbouring higher proportions of Bacteroidetes, including Porphyromonadaceae bacteria previously linked with negative effects on lipid metabolism and induction of hepatic steatosis. These results indicate that the mechanism of dietary t10c12-CLA on lipid metabolism in mice may be, at least, partially mediated by alterations in gut microbiota composition and functionality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27663860>Role of angiotensin II type 1a receptor in renal injury induced by deoxycorticosterone -salt hypertension.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo role of angiotensin II type 1a (AT1a) receptor in renal damage as a result of hypertension by using transgenic mice with AT1a receptor gene disruption. Transgenic mice that express human -type  acid binding protein (L-FABP) with or without disruption of the AT1a receptor gene (L-FABP AT1a, and L-FABP AT1a, respectively) were used with urinary L-FABP as an indicator of tubulointerstitial damage.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms of action of G on cellular metabolism are largely unknown.We propose that G could be a potential agent for the treatment of hyperlipidemia that could contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to advance our understanding of its mechanism of action on cholesterol and TG metabolism.NIH mice received supplemented diets containing 25, 50, and 75 mmol G/kg chow. After a 3-week treatment, serum total-cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured by commercial kits and lipid biosynthesis determined by the [(14)C]  incorporated into  acids plus nonsaponifiable and total hepatic lipids of the mice. The activity of the mRNA encoding HMGCR-the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis-along with the enzyme levels and catalysis were assessed by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, and HMG-CoA-conversion assays, respectively. In-silico analysis of several genes involved in lipid metabolism and regulated by G in cultured cells was also performed. Finally, the mRNA levels encoded by the genes for the low-density-lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), the sterol-regulatory-element-binding transcription factor (SREBF2), the very-low-density-lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), and the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA) were determined by real-time RT-PCR.Plasma total-cholesterol and triglyceride levels plus hepatic -acid, total-lipid, and nonsaponifiable-lipid biosynthesis were significantly reduced by feeding with G. Even though an up-regulation of the mRNA encoding HMGCR occurred in the G treated mouse livers, the protein levels and specific activity of the enzyme were both inhibited. G also enhanced the mRNAs encoding the LDL and VLDL receptors and reduced ACACA mRNA, without altering the transcription of the mRNA encoding the SREBF2.The following mechanisms may have mediated the decrease in plasma lipids levels in mice: a down-regulation of hepatocyte-cholesterol synthesis occurred as a result of decreased HMGCR protein levels and catalytic activity; the levels of LDLR mRNA became elevated, thus suggesting an increase in the uptake of serum LDL, especially by the ; and TG synthesis became reduced very likely because of a decrease in -acid synthesis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

In this study we investigated whether 3Ac-OA exerted beneficial effect on non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in rats and its potential underlying mechanisms. Treatment with 3Ac-OA (1-100 μmol/L) dose-dependently decreased the intracellular levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) in FFA-treated primary rat hepatocytes and human HepG2 cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, oil red staining studies showed that 3Ac-OA caused dose-dependent decrease in the number of lipid droplets in FFA-treated primary rat hepatocytes. SD rats were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks and subsequently treated with 3Ac-OA (60, 30, 15 mg·kg·d) for 4 weeks. 3Ac-OA administration significantly decreased the body weight,  weight and serum TC, TG, LDL-C levels in HFD rats. Furthermore, 3AcOA administration ameliorated lipid accumulation and cell apoptosis in the  of HFD rats. Using adipokine array analyses, we found that the levels of 11 adipokines (HGF, ICAM, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-5, IGFBP-6, lipocalin-2, MCP-1, M-CSF, Pref-1 and RAGE) were increased by more than twofold in the serum of 3Ac-OA-treated rats, whereas ICAM, IGF-1 and lipocalin-2 had levels increased by more than 20-fold. Moreover, 3Ac-OA administration significantly increased the expression of glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT-2) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), as well as the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), protein kinase B (AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) in the  tissues of HFD rats. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that 3Ac-OA exerts a protective effect against hyperlipidemia in NAFLD rats through AMPK-related pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26968209>Enhanced ethanol catabolism in orphan nuclear receptor SHP-null mice.</a></h2><p>Deficiency of the orphan nuclear hormone receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) protects mice from diet-induced hepatic steatosis, in part, via repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ2 (Pparg2) gene expression. Alcoholic  diseases (AFLD) share many common pathophysiological features with non-AFLD. To study the role of SHP and PPARγ2 in AFLD, we used a strategy of chronic ethanol feeding plus a single binge ethanol feeding to challenge wild-type (WT) and SHP-null (SHP(-/-)) mice with ethanol. The ethanol feeding induced  fat accumulation and mRNA expression of hepatic Pparg2 in WT mice, which suggests that a high level of PPARγ2 is a common driving force for fat accumulation induced by ethanol or a high-fat diet. Interestingly, ethanol-fed SHP(-/-) mice displayed hepatic fat accumulation similar to that of ethanol-fed WT mice, even though their Pparg2 expression level remained lower. Mortality of SHP(-/-) mice after ethanol binge feeding was significantly reduced and their acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh2) mRNA level was higher than that of their WT counterparts. After an intoxicating dose of ethanol, SHP(-/-) mice exhibited faster blood ethanol clearance and earlier wake-up time than WT mice. Higher blood , the end product of ethanol metabolism, and lower acetaldehyde levels were evident in the ethanol-challenged SHP(-/-) than WT mice. Ethanol-induced inflammatory responses and lipid peroxidation were also lower in SHP(-/-) mice. The current data show faster ethanol catabolism and extra fat storage through conversion of  to acetyl-CoA before its release into the circulation in this ethanol-feeding model in SHP(-/-) mice.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25236236>Effects of dietary hull-less barley β-glucan on the cholesterol metabolism of hypercholesterolemic hamsters.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study is to investigate the hypocholesterolemic effects of dietary hull-less barley β-glucan (HBG) on cholesterol metabolism in hamsters which were fed a hypercholesterolemic diet. The hamsters were divided into 3 groups and fed experimental diets, containing 5‰ HBG or 5‰ oat β-glucan (OG), for 30days. The HBG, as well as OG, lowered the concentration of plasma LDL-cholesterol significantly. The excretion of total lipids and cholesterol in feces were increased in HBG and OG groups compared with the control group. The activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in  was reduced significantly in the HBG group compared with the control and OG groups. The activity of cholesterol 7-α hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in the , in the HBG and OG groups, was significantly increased compared with the control group. The concentrations of , propionate and total short chain  acids (SCFAs) were not significantly different between the HBG and control groups. These results indicate that dietary HBG reduces the concentration of plasma LDL cholesterol by promoting the excretion of fecal lipids, and regulating the activities of HMG-CoA reductase and CYP7A1 in hypercholesterolemic hamsters.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Pers., commonly known as "sarpunkha" and "wild indigo", is being used in traditional systems of medicine to treat  disorders, spleen and kidney. In the present study, a validated High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) method was established for the estimation of lupeol, β-sitosterol and rotenone in various extracts of T. purpurea with the aim to see the effect of seasons on the quantity of aforesaid phytoconstituents. The plant material was collected in summer (April), rainy (August) and winter (December) during 2013-2014 from Lucknow, India. The method was validated in terms of precision, repeatability, specificity, sensitivity linearity and robustness. The method permits reliable quantification and showed good resolution on silica gel with toluene-ethyl -formic acid (9:1:1 v/v/v) as mobile phase, and characteristic bands of β-sitosterol, rotenone and lupeol were observed at Rf 0.38, 0.45 and 0.52, respectively. The content of aforesaid phytoconstituents varies from season to season and extract to extract. Our finding indicated that winter season (December) may not be appropriate for collection of T. purpurea for the preparation of therapeutic formulations because of the high content of rotenone, a known insecticide that is responsible for Parkinson's disease and associated with heart failure,  and  necrosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

Although rye fiber and polyphenols are thought to be bioactive, the mechanisms behind the health effects of WR have yet to be fully identified. This study in rats was designed to investigate whether WR can influence the metabolism of n-3 and n-6 long-chain  acids (LCFA) and gut microbiota composition.For 12 weeks, rats were fed a diet containing either 50% WR or 50% refined rye (RR). The WR diet provided more fiber (+21%) and polyphenols (+29%) than the RR diet. Fat intake was the same in both diets and particularly involved similar amounts of essential (18-carbon) n-3 and n-6 LCFAs.The WR diet significantly increased the 24-hour urinary excretion of polyphenol metabolites-including enterolactone-compared with the RR diet. The WR rats had significantly more n-3 LCFA-in particular, eicosapentanoic (EPA) and docosahexanoic (DHA) acids-in their plasma and . Compared with the RR diet, the WR diet brought significant changes in gut microbiota composition, with increased diversity in the feces (Shannon and Simpson indices), decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and decreased proportions of uncultured Clostridiales cluster IA and Clostridium cluster IV in the feces. In contrast, no difference was found between groups with regards to cecum microbiota. The WR rats had lower concentrations of total short-chain  acids (SCFA) in cecum and feces (p<0.05). Finally,  was lower (p<0.001) in the cecum of WR rats while butyrate was lower (p<0.05) in the feces of WR rats.This study shows for the first time that WR consumption results in major biological modifications-increased plasma and  n-3 EPA and DHA levels and improved gut microbiota profile, notably with increased diversity-known to provide health benefits. Unexpectedly, WR decreased SCFA levels in both cecum and feces.

Their source regarding the fish type, season, and location of harvesting might influence the nutritional value of such bioactive oils and determine their market price. The differences in price among such oils often lead to economically motivated mislabeling and adulteration.  In this study, our objective was to demonstrate how a qualitative targeted shotgun lipid profile workflow using an electrospray ionization-quadrupole-linear ion trap MS (QTrap) could differentiate fish oils originating from two different species.  Five samples each of sardine () oil and shark ()  oil were diluted to a concentration of 80 µg/mL in chloroform-methanol (1 + 2, v/v) with 5 mM ammonium . These samples were directly infused into a QTrap MS. The data were acquired for 23 precursor ion and 4 neutral loss scan experiments in the positive ionization mode and compared.  We identified the following major lipid classes: cholesteryl ester, diacyl glycerol, triacylglycerol, monoalkyldiacylglycerol, and phophatydyl choline. The relative peak areas of the identified lipid species, when subjected to supervised multivariate analysis, could effectively distinguish the sardine oil and shark  oil.  The approach will be useful in establishing authenticity of fish oil and to support the regulatory agencies in dispute resolution. It can also be extended to establish authenticity in other agricultural and food commodities.  This paper reports a proof of concept for authenticating PUFA-rich fish supplements.

Hence, including n-3 PUFA in the sow diet can be beneficial for reproduction. Both the amount and form (precursor  acids vs. long chain PUFA) of supplementation are important in this respect. Furthermore, including n-3 PUFA in the diet can have negative effects, such as decreased arachidonic acid (ARA) concentration and increased oxidative stress. This study aimed to compare the efficacy to increase eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) concentrations in the piglet, when different concentrations of linseed oil (LO, source of precursor α-linolenic acid) or fish oil (FO, source of EPA and DHA) were included in the maternal diet. Sows were fed a palm oil diet or a diet including 0.5% or 2% LO or FO from day 45 of gestation until weaning. Linoleic acid (LA) was kept constant in the diets to prevent a decrease in ARA, and all diets were supplemented with α-tocopherol  (150 mg/kg) and organic selenium (0.4 mg/kg) to prevent oxidative stress. Feeding 0.5% LO or 0.5% FO to the sows resulted in comparable EPA concentrations in the 5-day old piglet , but both diets resulted in lower EPA concentrations than when 2% LO was fed. The highest EPA concentration was obtained when 2% FO was fed. The DHA level in the piglet  could only be increased when FO, but not LO, was fed to the sows. The 2% FO diet had no advantage over the 0.5% FO diet to increase DHA in the piglet. Despite the constant LA concentration in the sow diet, a decrease in ARA could not be avoided when LO or FO were included in the diet. Feeding 2% FO to the sows increased the malondialdehyde concentration (marker for lipid peroxidation) in sow plasma, but not in piglets.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29348600>Chinese olive extract ameliorates hepatic lipid accumulation in vitro and in vivo by regulating lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Chinese olive contains plenty of polyphenols, which possess a wide range of biological actions. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the ethyl  fraction of Chinese olive fruit extract (CO-EtOAc) in the modulation of lipid accumulation in vitro and in vivo. In cellular studies, CO-EtOAc attenuated oleic acid-induced lipid accumulation; we then elucidated the molecular mechanisms of CO-EtOAc in FL83B mouse hepatocytes. CO-EtOAc suppressed the mRNA levels of  acid transporter genes (CD36 and FABP) and lipogenesis genes (SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC1), but upregulated genes that govern lipolysis (HSL) and lipid oxidation (PPARα, CPT-1, and ACOX). Moreover, CO-EtOAc increased the protein expression of phosphorylated AMPK, ACC1, CPT-1, and PPARα, but downregulated the expression of mature SREBP-1c and FAS. AMPK plays an essential role in CO-EtOAc-mediated amelioration of lipid accumulation. Furthermore, we confirmed that CO-EtOAc significantly inhibited body weight gain, epididymal adipose tissue weight, and hepatic lipid accumulation via regulation of the expression of  acid transporter, lipogenesis, and  acid oxidation genes and proteins in C57BL/6 mice fed a 60% high-fat diet.

Hepatic de novo lipogenesis is one of the main causes of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), which is thought to be a hepatic manifestation of certain metabolic syndromes. However, it has not yet been reported if CA has any therapeutic value in these diseases. Here, we investigated whether CA can inhibit hepatic lipogenesis induced by  X receptor α (LXRα) using an in vitro model. We found that the extract and ethyl acetated layer of CW decreased the mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), which plays a crucial role in hepatic lipogenesis. Additionally, we observed that CA could suppress the level of SREBP-1c, which was increased using two commercial LXRα agonists, GW3954 and T0901317. Moreover, the enzymes that act downstream of SREBP-1c were also inhibited by CA treatment. To understand the mechanism underlying this effect, the levels of phosphorylated AMP kinase (pAMPK) were measured after CA treatment. Therefore, CA might increase the pAMPK level by inducing phosphorylation of  kinase B1 (LKB1), which can then convert AMPK to pAMPK. Taken together, we conclude that CA has an alleviative effect on hepatic lipogenesis through the stimulation of the LKB1/AMPK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26726030>Aristolochia manshuriensis Kom ethyl  extract protects against high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by regulating kinase phosphorylation in mouse.</a></h2><p>Aristolochia manshuriensis Kom (AMK) is an herb used as a traditional medicine; however, it causes side effects such as nephrotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Nevertheless, AMK can be applied in specific ways medicinally, including via ingestion of low doses for short periods of time. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced the hepatocyte injury and inflammation. The protective effects of AMK against NASH are unclear; therefore, in this study, the protective effects of AMK ethyl  extract were investigated in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NASH model. We found decreased hepatic steatosis and inflammation, as well as increased levels of lipoproteins during AMK extract treatment. We also observed decreased hepatic lipid peroxidation and triglycerides, as well as suppressed hepatic expression of lipogenic genes in extract-treated livers. Treatment with extract decreased the activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) and increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). These results demonstrate that the protective effect of the extract against HFD-induced NASH occurred via reductions in reactive oxygen species production, inflammation suppression, and apoptosis related to the suppression of JNK1/2 activation and increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Taken together, these results indicate that that ethyl  extract of AMK has potential therapeutic effects in the HFD-induced NASH mouse model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30450847>Cancer Metabolism as a Mechanism of Treatment Resistance and Potential Therapeutic Target in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Various molecular targeted therapies and diagnostic modalities have been developed for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, HCC still remains a difficult malignancy to cure. Recently, the focus has shifted to cancer metabolism for the diagnosis and treatment of various cancers, including HCC. In addition to conventional diagnostics, the measurement of enhanced tumor cell metabolism using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) for increased glycolysis or C-11  for  acid synthesis by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is well established for clinical management of HCC. Unlike tumors displaying the Warburg effect, HCCs vary substantially in terms of 18F-FDG uptake, which considerably reduces the sensitivity for tumor detection. Accordingly, C-11  has been proposed as a complementary radiotracer for detecting tumors that are not identified by 18F-FDG. In addition to HCC diagnosis, since the degree of 18F-FDG uptake converted to standardized uptake value (SUV) correlates well with tumor aggressiveness, 18F-FDG PET/CT scans can predict patient outcomes such as treatment response and survival with an inverse relationship between SUV and survival. The loss of tumor suppressor genes or activation of oncogenes plays an important role in promoting HCC development, and might be involved in the "metabolic reprogramming" of cancer cells. Mutations in various genes such as , , , and  are responsible for the development of HCC. Some microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in cancer metabolism are deregulated in HCC, indicating that the modulation of genes/miRNAs might affect HCC growth or metastasis.

Understanding the mechanisms of cell metabolic reprogramming may present a new basis for  cancer treatment. In our previous study, we reported that a novel oncogene eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2) promotes tumorigenesis under hypoxic condition. Here, we aim to investigate the role of EIF5A2 in cell metabolic reprogramming during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. In this study, we reported that the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of EIF5A2 was upregulated in 59 of 105 (56.2%) HCC clinical samples (P = 0.015), and EIF5A2 overexpression was significantly associated with shorter survival time of patients with HCC (P = 0.021). Ectopic expression of EIF5A2 in HCC cell lines significantly promoted cell growth and accelerated glucose utilization and lipogenesis rates. The high rates of glucose uptake and lactate secretion conferred by EIF5A2 revealed an abnormal activity of aerobic glycolysis in HCC cells. Several key enzymes involved in glycolysis including glucose transporter type 1 and 2, hexokinase 2, phosphofructokinase  type, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase M2 isoform, phosphoglycerate mutase 1 and lactate dehydrogenase A were upregulated by overexpression of EIF5A2. Moreover, EIF5A2 showed positive correlations with FASN and ACSS2, two key enzymes involved in the  acid de novo biosynthetic pathway, at both protein and mRNA levels in HCC. These results indicated that EIF5A2 may regulate  acid de novo biosynthesis by increasing the uptake of . In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that EIF5A2 has a critical role in HCC cell metabolic reprogramming and may serve as a prominent novel therapeutic target for  cancer treatment.© The Author 2016.

In vivo experiment performed using binge alcohol consumption model.Although all five fractions (0-1000 µg/mL) were non-cytotoxic to HepG2 cells, only ethyl  fraction (SQEA), rich in phenolic acids such as p-coumaric acid and flavonoids particularly myristin, showed hepatoprotective effect against EtOH (400 mM) in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, SQEA significantly decreased the ethanol induced cell death and enhanced the cell proliferation. In in vivo experiment using binge consumption model (5 g of EtOH/kg body weight in every 12 h for 3 times), SQEA treatment (10, 50 and 100 mg/kg) markedly reduced the alcohol induced histopathological changes and serum EtOH content, and reversed the reduction of glutathione level in ethanol challenged livers.

At the end of the feeding trial, dietary Hg depressed the growth performances in terms of weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), feed efficiency (FE) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) in fish, while fish fed the diets supplemented with vitamin E showed significant growth improvement in both presence and absence of HgCl in the diets ( < 0.05). Survival rate was not affected in fish fed the experimental diets. Whole body compositions of fish such as lipid and moisture contents were influenced by dietary vitamin E supplementation. Total Hg contents of muscle,  and kidney tissues were significantly reduced in fish fed diets supplemented with vitamin E ( < 0.05), while the two-way ANOVA showed that increasing Hg concentration has resulted in a reduction in vitamin E. Whole body  acids of fish like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) contents were decreased by dietary Hg. However, supplementation of dietary vitamin E improved the α-linolenic acid (ALA) and EPA contents in fish.

However, the roles of OC compounds in the development of NAFLD has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the current study was designed to determine if exposure to trans-nonachlor, a prevalent OC compound, could promote hepatocyte lipid accumulation and determine potential pro-steatotic mechanisms. McArdle-RH7777 (McA) hepatoma cells were incubated with trans-nonachlor for 24 h then neutral lipid accumulation was determined by Oil Red O staining. Exposure to trans-nonachlor produced a concentration dependent increase in neutral lipid accumulation. Trans-nonachlor also increased extracellular free  acid-induced neutral lipid accumulation which appears to be due at least in part to increased free  acid accumulation as evident by increased accumulation of Bodipy labeled dodecanoic acid. Additionally, C- incorporation into total cellular lipids was increased by trans-nonachlor implicating increased de novo lipogenesis (DNL) as a potential mediator of trans-nonachlor-induced neutral lipid accumulation. Taken together, the present data indicate exposure to trans-nonachlor has a direct, pro-steatotic effect on hepatocytes to increase lipid accumulation through the combinatorial actions of extracellular free  acid accumulation and increased DNL.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We present a comprehensive multi-omics view of the effect of intestinal microbial colonization on hepatic lipid metabolism, integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and lipidomic analyses of  and plasma samples from germfree and specific pathogen-free mice. Microbes induce monounsaturated  acid generation by stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 and polyunsaturated  acid elongation by  acid elongase 5, leading to significant alterations in glycerophospholipid acyl-chain profiles. A composite classification score calculated from the observed alterations in  acid profiles in germfree mice clearly differentiates antibiotic-treated mice from untreated controls with high sensitivity. Mechanistic investigations reveal that  originating from gut microbial degradation of dietary fiber serves as precursor for hepatic synthesis of C16 and C18  acids and their related glycerophospholipid species that are also released into the circulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26260141>Short-chain  acids in control of body weight and insulin sensitivity.</a></h2><p>The connection between the gut microbiota and the aetiology of obesity and cardiometabolic disorders is increasingly being recognized by clinicians. Our gut microbiota might affect the cardiometabolic phenotype by fermenting indigestible dietary components and thereby producing short-chain  acids (SCFA). These SCFA are not only of importance in gut health and as signalling molecules, but might also enter the systemic circulation and directly affect metabolism or the function of peripheral tissues. In this Review, we discuss the effects of three SCFA (, propionate and butyrate) on energy homeostasis and metabolism, as well as how these SCFA can beneficially modulate adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and  tissue function. As a result, these SCFA contribute to improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, we also summarize the increasing evidence for a potential role of SCFA as metabolic targets to prevent and counteract obesity and its associated disorders in glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. However, most data are derived from animal and in vitro studies, and consequently the importance of SCFA and differential SCFA availability in human energy and substrate metabolism remains to be fully established. Well-controlled human intervention studies investigating the role of SCFA on cardiometabolic health are, therefore, eagerly awaited.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26176799>Biological Function of Acetic Acid-Improvement in Obesity and Glucose Tolerance by Acetic Acid in Type 2 Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p> acids derived from adipose tissue are oxidized by β-oxidation to form ketone bodies as final products under the starving condition. Previously, we found that free acetic acid was formed concomitantly with the production of ketone bodies in isolated rat  perfusion, and mitochondrial acetyl CoA hydrolase was appeared to be involved with the acetic acid production. It was revealed that acetic acid was formed as a final product of enhanced β-oxidation of  acids and utilized as a fuel in extrahepatic tissues under the starving condition. Under the fed condition, β-oxidation is suppressed and acetic acid production is decreased. When acetic acid was taken daily by obesity-linked type 2 diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima  (OLETF) rats under the fed condition, it protected OLETF rats against obesity. Furthermore, acetic acid contributed to protect from the accumulation of lipid in the  as well as abdominal fat in OLETF rats. Transcripts of lipogenic genes in the  were decreased, while transcripts of myoglobin and Glut4 genes in abdominal muscles were increased in the acetic acid-administered OLETF rats. It is indicated that exogenously administered acetic acid would have effects on lipid metabolism in both the  and the skeletal muscles, and have function that works against obesity and obesity-linked type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630414>First-in-class  acid synthase inhibitor TVB-2640 reduces hepatic de novo lipogenesis in males with metabolic abnormalities.</a></h2><p>Elevated hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is a key distinguishing characteristic of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In rodent models of NAFLD, treatment with a surrogate of TVB-2640, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS (FASi), has been shown to reduce hepatic fat and other biomarkers of DNL. The purpose of this Phase I clinical study was to test the effect of the TVB-2640 in obese men with certain metabolic abnormalities that put them at risk for NAFLD. Twelve subjects (mean±SE, 42±2y, BMI 37.4±1.2 kg/m , glucose 103±2 mg/dL, TG 196±27 mg/dL, and elevated  enzymes) underwent 10 days of treatment with TVB-2640 at doses ranging from 50-150 mg/d. Food intake was controlled throughout the study. Hepatic DNL was measured before and after an oral fructose/glucose (F/G) bolus using isotopic labeling with 1- C - IV infusion, followed by measurement of labeled VLDL-palmitate via GC/MS. Substrate oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry. Across the range of doses, fasting DNL was reduced by up to 90% (P=0.003). Increasing plasma concentrations of TVB-2640 were associated with progressive reductions in the percent of fructose-stimulated peak fractional DNL (R = - 0.749, P=0.0003) and absolute DNL AUC 6h post F/G bolus (R = - 0.409, P=0.025). For all subjects combined, ALT was reduced by 15.8±8.4% (P=0.05). Substrate oxidation was unchanged and safety monitoring revealed that the drug was well tolerated, without an increase in plasma triglycerides. Alopecia occurred in two subjects (reversed after stopping the drug), but otherwise no changes were observed in fasting glucose, insulin, ketones, and renal function. These data support the therapeutic potential of FASi, TVB-2640 in particular, in patients with NAFLD and NASH.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29529605>Acetic Acid Influences BRL-3A Cell Lipid Metabolism via the AMPK Signalling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Acetic acid (AcOH), a short-chain  acid, is reported to have some beneficial effects on metabolism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanism of acetic acid on hepatic lipid metabolism in BRL-3A cells.We cultured and treated BRL-3A cells with different concentrations of sodium  (neutralized acetic acid) and BML-275 (an AMPKα inhibitor). The total lipid droplet area was measured by oil red O staining, and the triglyceride content was determined by a triglyceride detection kit. We detected mRNA and protein levels of lipid metabolism-related signalling molecules by RT-PCR and Western blot.Acetic acid treatment increased AMPKα phosphorylation, which subsequently increased the expression and transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and upregulated the expression of lipid oxidation genes. These changes ultimate led to increasing levels of lipid oxidation in BRL-3A cells. Furthermore, elevated AMPKα phosphorylation reduced the expression and transcriptional activity of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, which reduced the expression of lipogenic genes, thereby decreasing lipid biosynthesis in BRL-3A cells. Consequently, triglyceride content in -treated BRL-3A cells was significantly decreased.These results indicate that acetic acid activates the AMPKα signalling pathway, leading to increased lipid oxidation and decreased lipid synthesis in BRL-3A cells, thereby reducing  fat accumulation in vitro.© 2018 The Author(s).

A total of 96 one-d-old Cobb 550 broilers were randomly divided into 8 treatments with three replicates having 4 birds in each. EFS (extruded at 155°C) at 100, 150 and 200 g/kg alone and in combination with ATA at 200 mg/kg were supplemented through normal feed from the third week onward. During the 6-week growth period, body weight gain (BWG), feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and mortality were recorded. At slaughter, weight of , heart and kidney and fat content in breast and leg meat were measured.  acid profiles in breast and leg meat were developed to estimate the PUFA to SFA ratio. The results revealed that FI and FCR changed significantly in all groups and BWG increased in all the supplemented groups. The weight of , kidney and heart increased more in the supplemented group containing the maximum level of EFS with ATA compared with single supplementation of EFS. The fat content in breast and leg meat decreased as the inclusion level of EFS increased. The level was low in leg meat compared with breast meat. Mortality decreased in all supplemented groups. The PUFA to SFA ratio was significantly higher in leg meat (3.23) compared with breast meat (1.81) and the study therefore indicates that ATA and EFS supplementation could be used to improve the PUFA to SFA ratio in broiler meat.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26655911>Stratification of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Based on  Utilization.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a deadly form of  cancer that is increasingly prevalent. We analyzed global gene expression profiling of 361 HCC tumors and 49 adjacent noncancerous  samples by means of combinatorial network-based analysis. We investigated the correlation between transcriptome and proteome of HCC and reconstructed a functional genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) for HCC. We identified fundamental metabolic processes required for cell proliferation using the network centric view provided by the GEM. Our analysis revealed tight regulation of  acid biosynthesis (FAB) and highly significant deregulation of  acid oxidation in HCC. We predicted mitochondrial  as an emerging substrate for FAB through upregulation of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACSS1) in HCC. We analyzed heterogeneous expression of ACSS1 and ACSS2 between HCC patients stratified by high and low ACSS1 and ACSS2 expression and revealed that ACSS1 is associated with tumor growth and malignancy under hypoxic conditions in human HCC.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Here, we report that T2, administered for 1 week to hypothyroid rats, increases total  acid synthesis from  in isolated hepatocytes. Studies carried out on  subcellular fractions demonstrated that T2 not only increases the activity and the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and  acid synthase but also of other proteins linked to DNL such as the mitochondrial citrate carrier and the cytosolic ATP citrate lyase. Parallelly, T2 stimulates the activities of enzymes supplying cytosolic NADPH needed for the reductive steps of DNL. With respect to both euthyroid and hypothyroid rats, T2 administration decreases the hepatic mRNA level of SREBP-1, a transcription factor which represents a master regulator of DNL. However, when compared to hypothyroid rats T2 significantly increases, without bringing to the euthyroid value, the content of both mature (nSREBP-1), and precursor (pSREBP-1) forms of the SREBP-1 protein as well as their ratio. Moreover, T2 administration strongly augmented the nuclear content of ChREBP, another crucial transcription factor involved in the regulation of lipogenic genes. Based on these results, we can conclude that in the  of hypothyroid rats the transcriptional activation by T2 of DNL genes could depend, at least in part, on SREBP-1- and ChREBP-dependent mechanisms.© 2019 IUBMB Life, 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679516>STC1 and PTHrP Modify Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism in  of a Teleost Fish.</a></h2><p>Stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) are calciotropic hormones in vertebrates. Here, a recently hypothesized metabolic role for these hormones is tested on European sea bass treated with: (i) teleost PTHrP(1-34), (ii) PTHrP(1-34) and anti-STC1 serum (pro-PTHrP groups), (iii) a PTHrP antagonist PTHrP(7-34) or (iv) PTHrP(7-34) and STC1 (pro-STC1 groups). Livers were analysed using untargeted metabolic profiling based on proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR) spectroscopy. Concentrations of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), alanine, glutamine and glutamate increased in pro-STC1 groups suggesting their mobilization from the muscle to the  for degradation and gluconeogenesis from alanine and glutamine. In addition, only STC1 treatment decreased the concentrations of succinate, fumarate and , indicating slowing of the citric acid cycle. In the pro-PTHrP groups the concentrations of glucose, erythritol and lactate decreased, indicative of gluconeogenesis from lactate. Taurine, trimethylamine, trimethylamine N-oxide and carnitine changed in opposite directions in the pro-STC1 versus the pro-PTHrP groups, suggesting opposite effects, with STC1 stimulating lipogenesis and PTHrP activating lipolysis/β-oxidation of  acids. These findings suggest a role for STC1 and PTHrP related to strategic energy mechanisms that involve the production of glucose and safeguard of  glycogen reserves for stressful situations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30390355>Feed processing effects on digestibility, palatability, excreta fermentation products and blood parameters in blue-fronted amazon parrots (Amazona aestiva).</a></h2><p>Captive parrots show a high incidence of obesity and other metabolic disorders due to the consumption of unbalanced diets. Therefore, this study evaluated the digestibility and metabolic effects of transitioning blue-fronted amazons from a high fat diet (sunflower seeds) to processed diets with three degrees of starch gelatinization (SG). The same feed formulation was processed to obtain pelletized feed (PEL) at 27.1% SG; low-cooked extruded feed (EXT ) at 81.6% SG; and high-cooked extruded feed (EXT ) at 98.5% SG. Thirty adult parrots were fed sunflower seeds for 90 days, then were distributed in a completely randomized design with 10 repetitions per treatment, and fed one of the three prepared diets for 160 days. Feed palatability, apparent digestibility, excreta concentrations of volatile  acids, lactate and ammonia, initial and final radiographic examinations, blood cell counts and glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, total protein, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and uric acid levels were evaluated. The data were analysed by an analysis of variance and compared by Tukey's test (p < 0.05). Sunflower seed was more digestible than processed feeds (p < 0.05). Diet processing interfered with fat and starch digestibility (p < 0.001), being higher in the PEL than in the EXT and EXT respectively. Transitioning from sunflower seeds to balanced diets reduced serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and AST (p < 0.05) and increased red blood cell, haemoglobin, lymphocyte, monocyte and leucocyte counts (p < 0.01). Radiographs indicated a decreased hourglass (p = 0.015) and a reduced heart- ratio after ingesting the processed feeds (p < 0.05). Feed processing did not affect blood cell counts, serum biochemistry or radiographic examinations. In conclusion, parrots preferred the extruded diet and did not require an extensive SG to properly digest the feed. Consuming the processed diets improved the birds' metabolism and health.© 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553186>Primary cultured neuronal networks and type 2 diabetes model mouse  tissues in aqueous liquid observed by atmospheric SEM (ASEM): Staining preferences of metal solutions.</a></h2><p>Neural networking, including axon targeting and synapse formation, is the basis of various brain functions, including memory and learning. Diabetes-mellitus affects peripheral nerves and is known to cause  disease. Electron microscopy (EM) provides the resolution required to observe changes in fine subcellular structures caused by such physiological and pathological processes, but samples are observed in vacuum. Environmental capsule EM can directly observe cells in a more natural aqueous environment, but the size-limited capsules restrict cell culturability. The recently developed atmospheric scanning electron microscope (ASEM) has an open, 35 mm sample dish, allowing the culture of primary cells, including neurons, on the electron-transparent film window fabricated in its base. The system's inverted scanning electron microscope observes aldehyde-fixed cells or tissues from below through the silicon nitride film; the optical microscope located above allows direct correlation of fluorescence labeling. To observe fixed biological samples, damage due to low dose electron radiation is minimized in three ways. First, knock on damage that pushes out atoms is decreased by the low accelerating voltage of 10-30 kV. Second, increased radical generation due to the decreased acceleration voltage is countered by the addition of a radical scavenger, glucose or ascorbic acid, to the sample solution. Third, the large volume (max. 2 ml) of aqueous buffer surrounding the sample has a high specific heat capacity, minimizing the temperature increase caused by irradiation. Using ASEM, we have developed protocols for heavy metal staining in solution to selectively visualize intracellular structures. Various EM staining methods served as a starting point. Uranyl  preferably stains proteins and nucleic acid, and prior tannic acid treatment enhances membranes. Osmium tetroxide is suggested to enhance lipids, especially oil droplets. Imaging primary-culture neurons stained with platinum blue or uranyl  revealed growth cones, synapses, and 50-500 nm spines, together with neurite backbones and their associated structures. Correlative microscopy with immuno-fluorescence labeling suggested that these were mainly microtubule associated objects; some showed signs of a fission process and were, thus, possibly mitochondria.  tissue excised from the ob/ob type 2 diabetes model mouse, was stained with osmium tetroxide and observed using ASEM. Swollen bright balls occupied a large area of the cytoplasm and could be distinguished from vacuoles, suggesting that they are oil droplets. In some of the images, oil-like droplets were pressing surrounding structures, including sinusoids, significant for blood circulation in the . Based on these studies, ASEM combined with metal staining methods promises to allow the study of various mesoscopic-scale phenomena of cells and tissues immersed in natural aqueous environment in the near future. The quick nature of ASEM could facilitate not only the precise imaging for neuroscience but also the diagnosis of  disease and related diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus is a scombroid fish highly appreciated as seafood worldwide. Being a top pelagic predator, concerns have been raised over human health risks due to its consumption. Therefore, herein it was comprehensively evaluated the health status and potential metabolite shifts between sexes of bluefin tuna from the Mediterranean Sea, proved to bioaccumulate environmental obesogens, namely polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) at hepatic level. To this aim, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics was applied on  of post-spawning tuna. Findings from this study pointed out that hepatic bioaccumulation of PCBs and OCPs induced differential metabolic disturbances between sexes, attributable to the reproductive stage at which tuna were caught. Alterations were mainly found in energy-producing metabolic pathways (with changes in , acetoacetate, malonate, and lactate), amino acid (with changes in BCAA, alanine, sarcosine, and tyrosine), and lipid (with changes in choline and phosphocholine) metabolism, with activation of  acids biosynthesis and ketogenesis in male tuna. Overall, according to the current European legislation on maximum levels of contaminants in seafood, the consumption of bluefin tuna does not represent a risk for human health.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Proposed mechanisms on how the gut microbiota could contribute to obesity and metabolic diseases include: (1) improved energy extraction from diet by the conversion of dietary fibre to SCFA; (2) increased intestinal permeability for bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in response to the consumption of high-fat diets resulting in an elevated systemic LPS level and low-grade inflammation. Animal studies indicate differences in the physiologic effects of fermentable and non-fermentable dietary fibres as well as differences in long- and short-term effects of fermentable dietary fibre. The human intestinal microbiome is enriched in genes involved in the degradation of indigestible polysaccharides. The extent to which dietary fibres are fermented and in which molar ratio SCFA are formed depends on their physicochemical properties and on the individual microbiome.  and propionate play an important role in lipid and glucose metabolism.  serves as a substrate for de novo lipogenesis in , whereas propionate can be utilised for gluconeogenesis. The conversion of fermentable dietary fibre to SCFA provides additional energy to the host which could promote obesity. However, epidemiologic studies indicate that diets rich in fibre rather prevent than promote obesity development. This may be due to the fact that SCFA are also ligands of free  acid receptors (FFAR). Activation of FFAR leads to an increased expression and secretion of enteroendocrine hormones such as glucagon-like-peptide 1 or peptide YY which cause satiety. In conclusion, the role of SCFA in host energy balance needs to be re-evaluated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27889747>Alisol A 24- Prevents Hepatic Steatosis and Metabolic Disorders in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is closely associated with metabolic disorders including hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation.

Preventive role of Alisol A 24- was evaluated using 10µM Alisol A 24- plus 1 mM FFA (oleate:palmitate=2:1) incubated with HepG2 cells for 24 h, which was determined by Oil Red O Staining, Oil Red O based colorimetric assay and intracellular triglyceride (TG) content. Besides, the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α, interleukin (IL)-6 levels as well as the protein and mRNA expressions that were involved in  acid synthesis and oxidation including Adiponectin, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC),  acid synthase (FAS), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and acyl coenzyme A oxidase 1 (ACOX1) were detected.Alisol A 24- significantly decreased the numbers of lipid droplets, Oil Red O lipid content, and intracellular TG content. Besides, inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 levels were markedly inhibited by Alisol A 24-. Furthermore, Alisol A 24- effectively increased the protein and mRNA expressions of Adiponectin, the phosphorylation of AMPKα, CPT1 and ACOX1, whereas decreased SREBP-1c, the phosphorylation of ACC and FAS at both protein and mRNA levels. However, there was no significant effect on the protein and mRNA expressions of PPARα by Alisol A 24-.These results demonstrated that Alisol A 24- effectively ameliorated hepatic steatosis likely through Adiponectin, which activated AMPKα signaling pathways via down-regulating SREBP-1c, ACC, FAS and up-regulating CPT1 and ACOX1, and inhibited inflammation.

Moreover, both POS and Zn-POS supplementation improved Zn status and gut function as evidenced by increased metallothionein concentrations in the pancreas, villus height in the duodenum and isobutyrate concentrations in the caecal digesta. Additionally, Zn-POS supplementation increased gene expressions of metallothionein, Zn transporter 1, Zn transporter 2 in the pancreas, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 in the , the concentrations of , propionate, butyrate and total SCFA in the caecal digesta and the villus height to crypt depth ratio in the duodenum and jejunum, whereas decreased the crypt depth in these two tissues. Altogether, our results revealed that dietary POS or Zn-POS supplementation benefited growth performance, Zn status, antioxidant ability and gut function of broilers. Supplementing Zn-POS in the form of chelate was more effective than feeding POS or ZnSO separately.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246194>Inhibition of miR-29 has a significant lipid-lowering benefit through suppression of lipogenic programs in .</a></h2><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators and potential therapeutic targets of metabolic disease. In this study we show by in vivo administration of locked nucleic acid (LNA) inhibitors that suppression of endogenous miR-29 lowers plasma cholesterol levels by ~40%, commensurate with the effect of statins, and reduces  acid content in the  by ~20%. Whole transcriptome sequencing of the  reveals 883 genes dysregulated (612 down, 271 up) by inhibition of miR-29. The set of 612 down-regulated genes are most significantly over-represented in lipid synthesis pathways. Among the up-regulated genes are the anti-lipogenic deacetylase sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and the anti-lipogenic transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), the latter of which we demonstrate is a direct target of miR-29. In vitro radiolabeled  incorporation assays confirm that pharmacologic inhibition of miR-29 significantly reduces de novo cholesterol and  acid synthesis. Our findings indicate that miR-29 controls hepatic lipogenic programs, likely in part through regulation of Ahr and Sirt1, and therefore may represent a candidate therapeutic target for metabolic disorders such as dyslipidemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27188742>In Vitro and in Vivo antioxidant activity of ethyl  extraction of purple rice.</a></h2><p>The antioxidant activities of ethyl  extraction of purple rice (EAEPR) were evaluated by various methods in vitro and in vivo. In in vitro antioxidant assays, EAEPR was found to have strong 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity hydroxyl radical, reducing power and metal-ion chelating activity. In in vivo antioxidant assays, mice were administered with EAEPR via gavage for 42 consecutive days. As a result, administration of EAEPR significantly enhanced the activities of glutathione peroxidase in serums and livers of mice. EAEPR could improve the lipid status, especially total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In addition, total phenolic content of EAEPR was 188.21mg/g. The main phenolic compounds in EAEPR analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry were determined as ferulic acid and quercetin. The contents of ferulic acid and quercetin in EAEPR were 14.21mg/g and 35.28mg/g, respectively. The Nrf2 expression was significantly elevated after administration of EAEPR.These results suggested that EAEPR had potent antioxidant activity and could be explored as a novel natural antioxidant.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729181>Expression of CYP4V2 in human THP1 macrophages and its transcriptional regulation by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.</a></h2><p>Because macrophages respond to a variety of pathological and pharmacological reagents, understanding the role of P450s in macrophages is important for therapeutic intervention. There has been a lack of research on CYP4 in macrophages, but  acid accumulation and lipid trafficking in macrophages have been suggested to be a main cause of atherosclerosis. All human CYP4 genes (n=12) were screened in THP1 macrophages by gene-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Only CYP4V2 exhibited strong expression of both mRNA and protein. Expression levels of both CYP4V2 mRNA and protein were significantly reduced after treatment with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist GW9662. However, the expression levels of CYP4V2 were not changed by PPARα antagonist (GW6471) and  X receptor alpha antagonist (22-S hydroxycholesterol). A metabolite of the CYP4V2 enzyme, 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid, was detected in THP1 macrophages, and this metabolite was significantly decreased after treatment with the PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 (>80% decreased, p<0.05). In summary,  acid metabolizing protein CYP4V2 was identified in human THP1 macrophages, and its expression was regulated by PPARγ. Further study is required to understand the role of CYP4V2 with regard to fat accumulation in the activated macrophage and atherosclerotic plaque development.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The present work demonstrates the protective effect of PQQ producing EcN against rotenone induced mitochondrial oxidative stress and consequence of mitochondrial and cellular dysfunction in naturally ageing rat model. PQQ is a potent antioxidant molecule also known to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and function in mammals.Firstly, adult rats (16-18 weeks old) were treated with rotenone (2.5 mg/kg body weight; i.p.) daily for 28 days along with PQQ (10 mg/kg diet, daily) and modified probiotic EcN strains (10(8) CFU twice weekly). Secondly, ageing rats (48-50 weeks old) were gavaged with probiotic EcN strains (10(8)CFU twice weekly) and PQQ (10 mg/kg diet, daily) for 8 months.PQQ producing EcN-5 treatment prevented rotenone induced hepatic oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in rats as assessed by reduced lipid peroxidation (29%), elevated glutathione (GSH) content (43%), increased catalase (52%) and superoxide dismutase (52%) activities when compared to only rotenone treatment. Moreover, increased hepatic mitochondrial content (41%), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) mRNA (25%) and mitochondrial Superoxide Dismutase (Mit-SOD) activity (94%) were also observed in EcN-5 treated rats. Rotenone treated rats did not exhibit gain in body weight, whereas rats co-treated with EcN-5 showed significant restoration in body weight gain. Furthermore, weekly administration of EcN-5 to naturally ageing rats for eight months resulted in significant reduction of oxidative stress in hepatic and colonic tissues (assessed by lipid peroxidation, GSH content and catalase and SOD enzyme activities) along with increase in hepatic mitochondrial enzyme activities (Mit-SOD and succinate dehydrogenase) and biogenesis, when compared to untreated rats. Additionally, these rats also exhibited reduced expression of  acid synthase (50%) and increased expression of acyl coenzyme oxidase (225%) genes in  in contrast to untreated rats resulting in lowered triglyceride (13% & 13.5%) and cholesterol (21% & 27%) levels in plasma and , respectively. Increased levels of butyrate (93%), propionate (45%) and  (18%) were also found in colonic content of these rats. PQQ administered daily (supplemented in diet) exhibited more or less similar effect as weekly gavaged EcN-5 in both the experiments, which substantiate that these effects are mediated by PQQ.These results suggest that genetically modified EcN-5 can be used as a nutritional supplement which can reduce age related oxidative stress and hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, it also rejuvenates healthy mitochondria by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Dietary fibers, i.e. prebiotics, are fermented by human gut microbiota into the short-chain  acids (SCFAs) , propionate, and butyrate. SCFAs promote fat oxidation and improve metabolic health. Therefore, the prebiotic inulin might be an effective dietary strategy to improve human metabolism. We aimed to investigate the acute metabolic effects of ingesting inulin compared with digestible carbohydrates and to trace inulin-derived SCFAs using stable isotope tracer methodology.In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design, 14 healthy, overweight to obese men consumed a high-fat milkshake containing A) 24 g inulin of which 0.5 g was U-C-inulin (INU) or B) 24 g maltodextrin placebo (PLA), with a wash-out period of at least five days. Fat oxidation was measured via an open-circuit ventilated hood and blood samples were collected up to 7 h after ingestion. Plasma, breath, and fecal samples were collected, and appetite and satiety scores were assessed.Fat oxidation increased in the early postprandial phase (0-3 h), and both plasma glucose and insulin were lower after INU ingestion compared with PLA (all P < 0.05). Plasma free  acids were higher in the early, and lower in the late postprandial period after INU ingestion. Inulin was fermented into SCFAs as indicated by higher plasma  concentrations after INU compared with PLA (P < 0.05). In addition, we found continuous increases in plasma C-SCFA enrichments (P < 0.05 from t = 120 onwards) and breath CO enrichments after INU intake. There were no effects on plasma triglycerides, free glycerol, satiety hormones GLP-1 and PYY, and appetite and satiety scores.Ingestion of the prebiotic inulin improves fat oxidation and promotes SCFA production in overweight to obese men. Overall, replacing digestible carbohydrates with the fermentable inulin may favor human substrate metabolism.The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov under number .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was aimed at investigating the beneficial effects of OA-NO2 on the lipid metabolism and  steatosis in deoxycorticosterone - (DOCA-) salt induced hypertensive mice model. Male C57BL/6 mice were divided to receive DOCA-salt plus OA-NO2 or DOCA-salt plus vehicle and another group received neither DOCA-salt nor OA-NO2 (control group). After 3-week treatment with DOCA-salt plus 1% sodium chloride in drinking fluid, the hypertension was noted; however, OA-NO2 had no effect on the hypertension. In DOCA-salt treated mice, the plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels were significantly increased compared to control mice, and pretreatment with OA-NO2 significantly reduced these parameters. Further, the histopathology of  exhibited more lipid distribution together with more serious micro- and macrovesicular steatosis after DOCA-salt treatment and that was consistent with  tissue triglyceride and nonesterified  acids (NEFA) content. The mice pretreated with OA-NO2 showed reduced  damage accompanied with low  lipid content. Moreover, the  TBARS, together with the expressions of gp91phox and p47phox, were parallelly decreased. These findings indicated that OA-NO2 had the protective effect on  injury against DOCA-salt administration and the beneficial effect could be attributed to its antihyperlipidemic activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25497601>Control of appetite and energy intake by SCFA: what are the potential underlying mechanisms?</a></h2><p>In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the role of dietary fibre in obesity management. Much of this interest stems from animal and human studies which suggest that an increased intake of fermentable fibre can suppress appetite and improve weight management. A growing number of reports have demonstrated that the principal products of colonic fermentation of dietary fibre, SCFA, contribute to energy homeostasis via effects on multiple cellular metabolic pathways and receptor-mediated mechanisms. In particular, over the past decade it has been identified that a widespread receptor system exists for SCFA. These G-protein-coupled receptors, free  acid receptor (FFAR) 2 and FFAR3 are expressed in numerous tissue sites, including the gut epithelium and adipose tissue. Investigations using FFAR2- or FFAR3-deficient animal models suggest that SCFA-mediated stimulation of these receptors enhances the release of the anorectic hormones peptide tyrosine tyrosine and glucagon-like peptide-1 from colonic L cells and leptin from adipocytes. In addition, the SCFA  has recently been shown to have a direct role in central appetite regulation. Furthermore, the SCFA propionate is a known precursor for hepatic glucose production, which has been reported to suppress feeding behaviour in ruminant studies through the stimulation of hepatic vagal afferents. The present review therefore proposes that an elevated colonic production of SCFA could stimulate numerous hormonal and neural signals at different organ and tissue sites that would cumulatively suppress short-term appetite and energy intake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26345299>Gynura procumbens Reverses Acute and Chronic Ethanol-Induced  Steatosis through MAPK/SREBP-1c-Dependent and -Independent Pathways.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect and mechanism of action of Gynura procumbens on acute and chronic ethanol-induced  injuries. Ethanol extract from G. procumbens stems (EEGS) attenuated acute ethanol-induced serum alanine aminotransferase levels and hepatic lipid accumulation. Therefore, EEGS was successively extracted by petroleum, ethyl , and n-butyl alcohol. The results showed that the n-butyl alcohol extract was the active fraction of EEGS, and hence it was further fractionated on a polyamide glass column. The 60% ethanol-eluted fraction that contained 13.6% chlorogenic acid was the most active fraction, and its effect was further evaluated using a chronic model. Both the n-butyl alcohol extract and the 60% ethanol-eluted fraction inhibited chronic ethanol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation by modulating lipid metabolism-related regulators through MAPK/SREBP-1c-dependent and -independent signaling pathways and ameliorated  steatosis. Our findings suggest that EEGS and one of its active ingredients, chlorogenic acid, may be developed as potential effective agents for ethanol-induced  injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29494208>The impact of short-chain  acids on GLP-1 and PYY secretion from the isolated perfused rat colon.</a></h2><p>The colonic epithelium harbors a large number of endocrine cells, but little is known about the endocrine functions of the colon. However, the high density of glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1)- and peptide-YY (PYY)-secreting L cells is of great interest because of the potential antidiabetic and antiobesity effects of GLP-1 and PYY. Short-chain  acids (SCFAs) produced by local bacterial fermentation are suggested to activate the colonic free  acid receptors FFAR2 (GPR43) and FFAR3 (GPR41), stimulating the colonic L cells. We used the isolated perfused rat colon as a model of colonic endocrine secretion and studied the effects of the predominant SCFAs formed: , propionate, and butyrate. We show that luminal and especially vascular infusion of  and butyrate significantly increases colonic GLP-1 secretion, and to a minor extent also PYY secretion, but only after enhancement of intracellular cAMP. Propionate neither affected GLP-1 nor PYY secretion whether administered luminally or vascularly. A FFAR2- and FFAR3-specific agonist [( S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,3-dimethyl- N-(5-phenylthiazol-2-yl)butamide (CFMB)/ AR420626 ] had no effect on colonic GLP-1 output, and a FFAR3 antagonist ( AR399519 ) did not decrease the SCFA-induced GLP-1 response. However, the voltage-gated Ca-channel blocker nifedipine, the K-channel opener diazoxide, and the ATP synthesis inhibitor 2,4-dinitrophenol completely abolished the responses. FFAR2 receptor studies confirmed low-potent partial agonism of , propionate, and butyrate, compared with CFMB, which is a full agonist with ~750-fold higher potency than the SCFAs. In conclusion, SCFAs may increase colonic GLP-1/PYY secretion, but FFAR2/FFAR3 do not seem to be involved. Rather, SCFAs are metabolized and appear to function as a colonocyte energy source. NEW & NOTEWORTHY By the use of in situ isolated perfused rat colon we show that short-chain  acids (SCFAs) primarily are used as a colonocyte energy source in the rat, subsequently triggering glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion independent of the free  acid receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3. Opposite many previous studies on SCFAs and FFAR2/FFAR3 and GLP-1 secretion, this experimental model allows investigation of the physiological interactions between luminal nutrients and secretion from cells whose function depend critically on their blood supply as well as nerve and paracrine interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26098097>Non Digestible Oligosaccharides Modulate the Gut Microbiota to Control the Development of Leukemia and Associated Cachexia in Mice.</a></h2><p>We tested the hypothesis that changing the gut microbiota using pectic oligosaccharides (POS) or inulin (INU) differently modulates the progression of leukemia and related metabolic disorders. Mice were transplanted with Bcr-Abl-transfected proB lymphocytes mimicking leukemia and received either POS or INU in their diet (5%) for 2 weeks. Combination of pyrosequencing, PCR-DGGE and qPCR analyses of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that POS decreased microbial diversity and richness of caecal microbiota whereas it increased Bifidobacterium spp., Roseburia spp. and Bacteroides spp. (affecting specifically B. dorei) to a higher extent than INU. INU supplementation increased the portal SCFA propionate and butyrate, and decreased cancer cell invasion in the . POS treatment did not affect hepatic cancer cell invasion, but was more efficient than INU to decrease the metabolic alterations. Indeed, POS better than INU delayed anorexia linked to cancer progression. In addition, POS treatment increased  in the caecal content, changed the  acid profile inside adipose tissue and counteracted the induction of markers controlling β-oxidation, thereby hampering fat mass loss. Non digestible carbohydrates with prebiotic properties may constitute a new nutritional strategy to modulate gut microbiota with positive consequences on cancer progression and associated cachexia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28824323> leaf extract improves  syndrome by increasing lipid oxidation and decreasing the lipogenesis pathway in mice.</a></h2><p>Some members of  genus are traditionally used as medicinal plants for arthritis, acute and chronic bronchitis, asthma, pain, inflammation, rheumatism, hypertension and metabolic diseases. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the protective effects of  leaf extract on non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD)  and . In this study, the effects of  leaf extract on inhibiting the free  acid (FFA)-induced accumulation of fat in HepG2 cells and on improving  syndrome in mice with high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD were investigated. For the  assay, HepG2 cells were treated with FFAs (oleate/palmitate = 2:1) with or without treatment with  leaf ethyl  (EtOAc) fraction to observe lipid accumulation using Nile red and oil red O stains. For the  assay, C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to three groups ( = 5), including the normal diet group, the HFD group and the HFD+EtOAc group. After 11 weeks, body weight, serum biochemical indices and the mRNA expressions of the  tissue, as well as the outward appearance, weight and histopathological analysis of  and adipose tissues were evaluated. Among the fractions derived from  leaf, the EtOAc fraction exhibited a strong fat-accumulation inhibitory activity. Following reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), four specific phytochemicals, including (2, 3)-astilbin (AS), hyposide (HY), guaijaverin (GU) and quercitrin (QU), were isolated and identified from the EtOAc fraction of  leaf extract. Among them, AS and HY showed excellent fat-accumulation inhibitory activity. Thus, the EtOAc fraction of  leaf and its derived phytochemicals have great potential in preventing FFA-induced fat accumulation. In addition, the EtOAc fraction of  leaf significantly improved  syndrome and reduced total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) in HFD-induced NAFLD mice at a dosage of 200 mg/kg BW. These results demonstrated that the methanolic extracts from  leaf have excellent inhibitory activities against fat accumulation and anti-NAFLD activities and thus have great potential as a natural health product.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29558206>Dose-dependent quantitative effects of acute fructose administration on hepatic de novo lipogenesis in healthy humans.</a></h2><p>Fructose feeding increases hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and is associated with nonalcoholic  disease. Little is known, however, about individual variation in susceptibility to fructose stimulation of DNL. In this three-period crossover study, 17 healthy male subjects were enrolled to evaluate the within- and between-subject variability of acute fructose feeding on hepatic fractional DNL. During each assessment, [1-C] was infused to measure DNL in the fasting state and during fructose feeding. Subjects randomly received a high dose of fructose (10 mg·kg fat-free mass·min) on two occasions and a low dose (5 mg·kg fat-free mass·min) on another. Fructose solutions were administered orally every 30 min for 9.5 h. Ten subjects completed all three study periods. DNL was assessed as the fractional contribution of newly synthesized palmitate into very-low-density lipoprotein triglycerides using mass isotopomer distribution analysis. Mean fasting DNL was 5.3 ± 2.8%, with significant within- and between-subject variability. DNL increased dose dependently during fructose feeding to 15 ± 2% for low- and 29 ± 2% for high-dose fructose. The DNL response to high-dose fructose was very reproducible within an individual ( r = 0.93, P < 0.001) and independent of fasting DNL. However, it was variable between individuals and significantly correlated to influx of unlabeled acetyl-CoA ( r = 0.7, P < 0.001). Unlike fasting DNL, fructose-stimulated DNL is a robust and reproducible measure of hepatic lipogenic activity for a given individual and may be a useful indicator of metabolic disease susceptibility and treatment response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28501098>Alterations in intestinal microbiota relate to intestinal failure-associated  disease and central line infections.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota plays a vital role in modulating the metabolic and immune functions of the intestines.

Gut microbiota may play a regulatory role in gastrointestinal health, substrate metabolism, and peripheral tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, , and pancreas via its metabolites short-chain  acids (SCFA). Animal and human data demonstrated that, in particular,  beneficially affects host energy and substrate metabolism via secretion of the gut hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY, which, thereby, affects appetite, via a reduction in whole-body lipolysis, systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and via an increase in energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Thus, potential therapies to increase gut microbial fermentation and  production have been under vigorous scientific scrutiny. In this review, the relevance of the colonically and systemically most abundant SCFA  and its effects on the previously mentioned tissues will be discussed in relation to body weight control and glucose homeostasis. We discuss in detail the differential effects of oral  administration (vinegar intake), colonic  infusions, acetogenic fiber, and acetogenic probiotic administrations as approaches to combat obesity and comorbidities.

Radiolabeled nutrients, including glucose and , are extensively used for the detection of various tumors, including hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). High signal of [(11)C] positron emission tomography (PET) in tumors is often considered to be associated with increased expression of  acid synthase (FASN) and increased de novo lipogenesis in tumor tissues. Defining a subset of tumors with increased [(11)C] PET signal and thus increased lipogenesis was suggested to help select a group of patients, who may benefit from lipogenesis-targeting therapies.To investigate whether [(11)C] PET imaging is truly associated with increased de novo lipogenesis along with hepatocarcinogenesis, we performed [(11)C] PET imaging in wild-type mice as well as two mouse HCC models, induced by myrAKT/Ras(V12) (AKT/Ras) and PIK3CA(1047R)/c-Met (PI3K/Met) oncogene combinations. In addition, we analyzed FASN expression and de novo lipogenesis rate in these mouse  tissues.We found that while HCCs induced by AKT/Ras co-expression showed high levels of [(11)C] PET signal compared to normal , HCCs induced by PI3K/Met overexpression did not. Intriguingly, elevated FASN expression and increased de novo lipogenesis rate were observed in both AKT/Ras and PI3K/Met HCCs.Altogether, our study suggests that [(11)C] PET imaging can be a useful tool for imaging of a subset of HCCs. However, at molecular level, the increased [(11)C] PET imaging is not always associated with increased FASN expression or de novo lipogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26479316>NMR-based metabolic profiling in healthy individuals overfed different types of fat: links to changes in  fat accumulation and lean tissue mass.</a></h2><p>Overeating different dietary  acids influence the amount of  fat stored during weight gain, however, the mechanisms responsible are unclear. We aimed to identify non-lipid metabolites that may differentiate between saturated (SFA) and polyunsaturated  acid (PUFA) overfeeding using a non-targeted metabolomic approach. We also investigated the possible relationships between plasma metabolites and body fat accumulation.In a randomized study (LIPOGAIN study), n=39 healthy individuals were overfed with muffins containing SFA or PUFA. Plasma samples were precipitated with cold acetonitrile and analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Pattern recognition techniques were used to overview the data, identify variables contributing to group classification and to correlate metabolites with fat accumulation.We previously reported that SFA causes a greater accumulation of  fat, visceral fat and total body fat, whereas lean tissue levels increases less compared with PUFA, despite comparable weight gain. In this study, lactate and  were identified as important contributors to group classification between SFA and PUFA (P<0.05). Furthermore, the fat depots (total body fat, visceral adipose tissue and  fat) and lean tissue correlated (P(corr)>0.5) all with two or more metabolites (for example, branched amino acids, alanine,  and lactate). The metabolite composition differed in a manner that may indicate higher insulin sensitivity after a diet with PUFA compared with SFA, but this needs to be confirmed in future studies.A non-lipid metabolic profiling approach only identified a few metabolites that differentiated between SFA and PUFA overfeeding. Whether these metabolite changes are involved in depot-specific fat storage and increased lean tissue mass during overeating needs further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27711850>Effect of tomato juice consumption on the plasmatic lipid profile, hepatic HMGCR activity, and fecal short chain  acid content of rats.</a></h2><p>The aims of the present study were to ascertain, indirectly, the prebiotic role of tomato juice, by analyzing its effect on the content of short chain  acids (SCFA) in feces of rats, and to determine the plausible mechanisms related to the hypocholesterolemic effects of tomato juice and lycopene, evaluating the activity of hepatic HMGCR and the formation of propionic acid. Two commercially available tomato juices with differing contents of lycopene (low and high lycopene contents: Llyc and Hlyc tomato juices) were used.

Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), a flagellin receptor, is required for gut microbiota homeostasis. Accordingly, TLR5-deficient (T5KO) mice are prone to develop microbiota-dependent metabolic syndrome. Here we observed that T5KO mice display elevated neutral lipids with a compositional increase of oleate [C18:1 (n9)] relative to wild-type littermates. Increased oleate contribution to hepatic lipids and  SCD1 expression were both microbiota dependent. Analysis of short-chain  acids (SCFAs) and (13)C- label incorporation revealed elevated SCFA in ceca and hepatic portal blood and increased  de novo lipogenesis in T5KO mice. Dietary SCFAs further aggravated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Deletion of hepatic SCD1 not only prevented hepatic neutral lipid oleate enrichment but also ameliorated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice.

A blood test showed leukophilia, mild hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatobiliary injury and coagulopathy. Image studies showed an extremely enlarged  and splenomegaly. The Japan alcoholic hepatitis score and Maddrey's discriminant function were 10 and 54 points, respectively. We diagnosed her with severe alcoholic hepatitis and treated her with corticosteroids, but her  function did not improve. We therefore administered the vitamin E product tochopheryl  (150 mg/day) as an add-on therapy, after which her leukophilia,  enzymes and coagulopathy improved immediately.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27357947> functions as an epigenetic metabolite to promote lipid synthesis under hypoxia.</a></h2><p>Besides the conventional carbon sources, acetyl-CoA has recently been shown to be generated from  in various types of cancers, where it promotes lipid synthesis and tumour growth. The underlying mechanism, however, remains largely unknown. We find that  induces a hyperacetylated state of histone H3 in hypoxic cells.  predominately activates lipogenic genes ACACA and FASN expression by increasing H3K9, H3K27 and H3K56 acetylation levels at their promoter regions, thus enhancing de novo lipid synthesis, which combines with its function as the metabolic precursor for  acid synthesis. Acetyl-CoA synthetases (ACSS1, ACSS2) are involved in this -mediated epigenetic regulation. More importantly, human hepatocellular carcinoma with high ACSS1/2 expression exhibit increased histone H3 acetylation and FASN expression. Taken together, this study demonstrates that , in addition to its ability to induce  acid synthesis as an immediate metabolic precursor, also functions as an epigenetic metabolite to promote cancer cell survival under hypoxic stress.</p></html>
