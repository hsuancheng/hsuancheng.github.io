Demographic, clinical, anthropometric data, and biochemical investigations for diagnosing MetS were collected.390 patients (age 35.±9.7years with range 20-73years; 81.3% women) were included. Mean NC was significantly higher in MetS than in non-MetS (p<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed NC ≥38cm and ≥33cm to be the optimal cutoff points for MetS in men and women, respectively. Body mass index and anthropometric indices were positively correlated with NC in both men and women. Among women, all components of MetS were significantly associated with NC.Using the identified gender-specific cutoff values, NC is a useful tool for predicting MetS in Thais. NC was found to be well-correlated with almost all of the  risk factors, anthropometric indices, and MetS components evaluated in this study.Copyright © 2019 Primary Care Diabetes Europe.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of polymorphism of the  gene with the sex of children with obesity and related pathologies. gene trp64arg genotyping was conducted in 441 children aged 6-18 years. Among these subjects, 264 were obese (103 boys; 161 girls) and 179 were of normal weight (81 boys; 98 girls). In the obese group, fasting lipids, glucose and insulin levels, and blood pressure were measured.  (MS) was defined according to the modified World Health Organization criteria adapted for children.The frequency of trp64arg genotype was similar in obese and normal weight children. In obese children, serum lipid, glucose, and insulin levels; homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scores; and MS were not different between arg allele carriers (trp64arg) and noncarriers (trp64trp). In 264 obese children, genetic analysis results revealed that the arg allele carriers were significantly higher in girls than in boys (=0.001). In the normal weight group, no statistically significant difference was found between genotypes of boys and girls (=0.771).Trp64arg polymorphism of the  gene was not associated with obesity and MS in Turkish children and adolescents. Although no relationships were observed between the genotypes and lipids, glucose/insulin levels, or HOMA-IR, the presence of trp64arg variant was frequent in obese girls, which can lead to weight gain as well as difficulty in losing weight in women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546914>An Early, Universal Mediterranean Diet-Based Intervention in Pregnancy Reduces Cardiovascular Risk Factors in the "Fourth Trimester".</a></h2><p>An early antenatal dietary intervention could play an important role in the prevention of  diseases postpartum. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether an early, specific dietary intervention reduces women's cardiovascular risk in the "fourth trimester". This prospective cohort study compares 1675 women from the standard-care group (ScG/n = 676), who received standard-care dietary guidelines, with the intervention group (IG/n = 999), who received Mediterranean diet (MedDiet)-based dietary guidelines, supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and nuts. Cardiovascular risk was determined by the presence of  (MetS) and insulin resistance  (IrS) (HOMA-IR 3.) at 12-14 weeks postpartum. MetS was less frequent in the IG (11.3 vs. 19.3%,  < 0.05). The intervention was associated with a reduction in the relative risk of having MetS: 0.74 (95% CI, 0.60-0.90), but not in the risk of IrS. When analyzing the presence of having one or more components of the MetS, the IG had significantly higher rates of having 0 components and lower rates of having ≥1 (-trend = 0.029).

The consumption of high-fructose diets contributes to the development of MetS. -sitosterol a naturally occurring phytosterol possesses antiobesogenic and antidiabetic effects. This study evaluated the potential protective effect of -sitosterol against the development of  dysfunction in growing female rats fed a high-fructose diet, mimicking children fed obesogenic diets. Thirty-five 21-day-old female Sprague Dawley rat pups were randomly allocated to and administered the following treatments: group 1-standard rat chow (SRC) + plain drinking water (PW) + plain gelatine cube (PC); group 2-SRC + 20% w/w fructose solution (FS) as drinking fluid + PC; group 3-SRC + FS + 100 mg/kg fenofibrate in gelatine cubes; group 4-SRC + FS + 20 mg/kg -sitosterol gelatine cube (Bst); and group -SRC + PW + Bst. Following 12 weeks of feeding, the rats were fasted overnight, weighed, and then euthanized. Plasma cholesterol, insulin, glucose, triglyceride, and adiponectin concentrations were determined. Visceral fat was dissected out and weighed. The high-fructose diet increased ( < .05) visceral adiposity and plasma triglyceride concentration but decreased ( < .05) plasma adiponectin concentration. -sitosterol prevented the high-fructose diet-induced visceral obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypoadiponectinemia. -sitosterol alone increased plasma adiponectin concentration and reduced plasma insulin concentration and homeostatic model assessment index. In conclusion, -sitosterol could be potentially used to prevent high-fructose diet-induced  dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31495392>Interleukin-1 Alpha Polymorphisms Are Associated With Body Mass Index in Male But Not in Female Adolescents.</a></h2><p>The Interleukin (IL)-1 family of cytokines plays a key role in the inflammatory response. Genes coding for IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-1Ra are located together as a block gene known as the IL-1 cluster. This genomic region shows wide nucleotide variability, and some polymorphisms have been widely studied and associated with features related to the .Eight polymorphisms within three genes of the IL-1 cluster, including IL1A (rs3783553, rs17561, and rs1800587), IL1B (rs1143634, rs1143627, and rs16944) and IL1RN (rs419598 and rs2234663) were genotyped in 460 Mexican adolescents. Genotype and haplotype frequencies are reported, as well as the linkage disequilibrium analysis. Genetic associations with some anthropometric and  traits were evaluated.Allele frequencies were similar to those found in other populations, and genotype proportions were according to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Seven haplotypes were observed at frequencies ≥%. Of the entire cluster, only the rs17561-rs1800587 and rs1143627-rs16944 pairs showed highest and significant linkage disequilibrium values. An haplotype of IL1A, rs17561T-rs1800587T, was significantly associated with increase in body mass index in males (p <0.008), whereas IL1B and IL1RN variants showed associations with insulin, and hs-CRP (p <0.05).Some MetS parameters seem to be influenced by variations in the IL-1 gene cluster in Mexican adolescents. These variations may confer risk for  alterations from early ages, and and these risks may be different when variables such as sex are considered. Strategies leading to generate protective behaviors could be designed to take into account specific variations in the IL-1 gene cluster and biological conditions such as sex.Copyright © 2019 IMSS.

Statins effectively combat hypercholesterolemia but are not well tolerated at high doses, raising the need for coprescription with cholesterol sorbents and/or absorption inhibitors. Montmorillonite (MMT) clay was found to attenuate hypercholesterolemia and obesity by reducing cholesterol and fat absorption. However, acicular clay-like sepiolite may offer better results due to its more substantial adsorption of nonpolar molecules. We herein aimed at (1) assessing  the capacity of sepiolite to adsorb edible oil and cholesterol compared with that of MMT and (2) assessing  the effect of continuous feeding on a high-fat high-cholesterol diet (HFD) (53.6% w/w fat and 0.2% cholesterol) supplemented with % (w/w) edible sepiolite, on diet-induced obesity rate, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed  that sepiolite adsorption of olive oil and cholesterol was five to eight times greater than that of MMT clay. Sepiolite supplementation to HFD fed to mature mice for 12. weeks resulted in lower total blood cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels and attenuated body weight gain, by reducing fat gain. Sepiolite supplementation did not affect energy intake but increased fecal extraction of sterols and lipids, without notable side effects. These results demonstrate that supplementing a HFD with sepiolite attenuates gastrointestinal absorption of dietary lipids and sterols, thus mitigating obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia.

Vitamin D is linked to several cardiometabolic diseases such as  (MetSyn), diabetes, and atherosclerosis. It is not known if vitamin D status is linked to cardiometabolic risk factors in Qatari women. Therefore, a relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitmain D [25(OH)D] concentrations and MetSyn was investigated in Qatari women using the Qatar Biobank database. Study sample consisted of 700 women, aged 20-80 years old. A multivariate-adjusted logistic regression was used to determine relation between serum 25(OH)D and MetSyn prevalence. Multivariate linear regression was performed to determine the association between serum 25(OH)D and markers of MetSyn. Prevalences of MetSyn in the first (≈32%), second (≈27%), and third (≈28%) serum 25(OH)D quartiles were significantly higher compared to fourth serum 25(OH)D quartile (≈17.%) (p < .035). The likelihood of having MetSyn was significantly higher in the first serum 25(OH)D quartile (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.06, 3.49) compared to the fourth serum 25(OH)D quartile (p < .001) in multivariate-adjusted analysis. No relationship was observed between serum 25(OH)D and waist circumference, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), blood glucose, HDL-cholesterol, and serum triglycerides. This study showed an inverse relationship between prevalence of MetSyn and serum 25(OH)D in Qatari women. Given the widespread prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Qatar, consideration should be given to vitamin D fortification of some selected staple foods and through targeted supplementation of vitamin D in those who are at risk for cardiometabolic diseases.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652477>A Compound Isolated from Phyllanthus tenellus Demonstrates  and Vascular Effects In Vitro.</a></h2><p>Common chronic conditions such as  and diabetes are increasingly associated to  and cardiovascular complications.

The structural determination of the isolated compounds was based on spectral data. The ability of the main active component, P7OG, to inhibit human platelet aggregation and to modify vascular reactivity of rat aortic rings incubated with high glucose (D-glucose 55 mM) was then evaluated. P7OG was further able to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by adenosine '-diphosphate and collagen, showed vasorelaxant effects in arteries precontracted with phenylephrine, and reverted the endothelium-dependent impairment effect of high glucose in rat aortic rings.

As well, the clinical forms of OA could differ significantly from one subject to another: some could have mono or polyarticular, erosive hand OA or recurrent effusion while we do not know what governs these different clinical presentations. We now consider the pathophysiology of OA according to the patient's risk factors because we know that they involve different pathogenic mechanisms. Thus, four major clinical phenotypes are defined based on risk factors which are age, trauma, obesity/ , and family history. Osteoarthritis is therefore a much more complex disease than it has been thought for a long time. The lack of efficient therapeutic may be due in part to the lack of knowledge of these different phenotypes that are always all grouped together in studies.

Thus, the evaluation of animal models tends to be comprehensive and objective. This may provide further understanding between the interaction between Tong Xie Yao Fang and the IBS model.To evaluate the effect of Tong Xie Yao Fang on IBS rats by using metabolomics method.Wistar rats were used to establish IBS models, and then randomly divided into four groups: A model control group and three Tong Xie Yao Fang treatment groups (high, medium and low doses). A normal, non-IBS group was established. The rats were treated for 2 wk. On days 0 and 14 of the experimental model, urine was collected for 12 h and was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Nine potential biomarkers were identified, and six major  pathways were found to be related to IBS.In the study of metabonomics, nine potential biomarkers including L-serine, 4-methylgallic acid, L-threonine, succinylacetone, prolyl-hydroxyproline, valyl-serine, acetyl citrate, marmesin rutinoside and -hydroxy-L-tryptophan were identified in urine, which were assigned to amino acids, organic acids, succinyl and glycosides. Furthermore, the  pathway of L-serine, L-threonine and -hydroxy-L-tryptophan was found in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, which mainly involved the metabolism of cysteine and methionine, vitamin B6 metabolism, serotonin synapse, tryptophan metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, digestion, absorption of protein and amino acid metabolism.

All interventional and observational studies that contained information on the relevant population (adult patients with obesity and MS), intervention (receiving allogeneic FMT) and outcomes ( parameters) were eligible. From 1096 unique citations, three randomized placebo-controlled studies (76 patients with obesity and MS, body mass index = 34.8 ± 4.1 kg/m, fasting plasma glucose = .8 ± 0.7 mmol/L) were included for review. Studies reported mixed results with regards to improvement in  parameters.

We aimed to synthesise evidence from epidemiological studies on associations between health outcomes and HTLV-1.For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, and Global Health for publications from their inception to July, 2018. We included cohort, case-control, and controlled cross-sectional studies that compared mortality or morbidity between people with and without HTLV-1. We excluded studies of psychiatric conditions, of symptoms or clinical findings only, of people who had undergone blood transfusion or organ transplant, and of population groups defined by a behavioural characteristic putting them at increased risk of co-infection with another virus. We extracted the risk estimates (relative risks [RRs] or odds ratios [ORs]) that reflected the greatest degree of control for potential confounders. We did a random-effects meta-analysis for groups of effect estimates where case ascertainment methods, age groups, and confounders were similar, presenting pooled estimates with 95% CIs and prediction intervals.Of the 3318 identified studies, 39 met the inclusion criteria, examining 42 clinical conditions between them. The adjusted risk of death due to any cause was higher in people with HTLV-1 when compared with HTLV-1-negative counterparts (RR 1·57, 95% CI 1·37-1·80). From meta-analysis, HTLV-1 was associated with increased odds of seborrheic dermatitis (OR 3·95, 95% CI 1·99-7·81), Sjogren's  (3·25, 1·85-·70), and, inversely, with lower relative risk of gastric cancer (RR 0·45, 0·28-0·71). There were a further 14 diseases with significant associations or substantially elevated risk with HTLV-1 from single studies (eczema [children]; bronchiectasis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis [analysed together]; asthma [males]; fibromyalgia; rheumatoid arthritis; arthritis; tuberculosis; kidney and bladder infections; dermatophytosis; community acquired pneumonia; strongyloides hyperinfection ; liver cancer; lymphoma other than adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma; and cervical cancer).There is a broad range of diseases studied in association with HTLV-1. However, the elevated risk for death among people with HTLV-1 is not explained by available studies of morbidity. Many of the diseases shown to be associated with HTLV-1 are not fatal, and those that are (eg, leukaemia) occur too rarely to account for the observed mortality effect. There are substantial research gaps in relation to HTLV-1 and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and  disease. The burden of disease associated with the virus might be broader than generally recognised.Commonwealth Department of Health, Australia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The generation of cortisol from this reaction may increase intra-abdominal cortisol levels and contribute to the physiopathogenesis of obesity and  (MetS). The relationship of  rs45487298 and  rs6688832 polymorphisms with obesity and MetS was studied. We also studied how  abdominal subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) gene expression is related to body fat distribution.Rates of obesity and MetS features were cross-sectionally analyzed according to these polymorphisms in 1006 Brazilian white patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Additionally,  expression was analyzed in VAT and SAT in a different cohort of 28 participants with and without obesity who underwent elective abdominal operations.Although polymorphisms of the two genes were not individually associated with MetS features, a synergistic effect was observed between both. Carriers of at least three minor alleles exhibited lower BMI compared to those with two or fewer minor alleles adjusting for gender and age (27.4 ± 4.9 vs. 29.3 ± .3 kg/m; P = 0.005; mean ± SD). Obesity frequency was also lower in the first group (24.4% vs. 41.6%, OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.87; P = 0.019). In the second cohort of 28 subjects,  gene expression in VAT was inversely correlated with BMI (r = - 0.435, P = 0.034), waist circumference (r = - 0.584, P = 0.003) and waist-to-height ratio (r = - 0.526, P = 0.010).These polymorphisms might interact in the protection against obesity in T2DM individuals. Obese individuals may have decreased intra-abdominal VAT  gene expression resulting in decreasing intra-abdominal cortisol levels as a compensatory mechanism against central and general adiposity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522936>Cardiovascular risk in HIV-infected individuals: A comparison of three risk prediction algorithms.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular (CV) risk is known to be increased in HIV-infected individuals. Our aim was to assess CV risk in HIV-infected adults.CV risk was estimated for each patient using three different risk algorithms: SCORE, the Framingham risk score (FRS), and DAD. Patients were classified as at low, moderate or high CV risk. Clinical and anthropometric data were collected.We included 571 HIV-infected individuals, mostly male (67.1%; n=383). Patients were divided into two groups according to antiretroviral therapy (ART): naïve (7.%; n=43) or under ART (92.%; n=528). The mean time since HIV diagnosis was 6.7±6. years in the naive group and 13.3±6.1 years in the ART group.  (MS) was identified in 33.9% (n=179) and 16.3% (n=7) of participants in the ART and naïve groups, respectively. MS was associated with ART (OR=2.7; p=0.018). Triglycerides ≥150 mg/dl (OR=13.643, p<0.001) was one of the major factors contributing to MS. Overall, high CV risk was found in 4.4% (n=23) of patients when the SCORE tool was used, in 20.% (n=117) using the FRS, and in 10.3% (n=59) using the DAD score. The observed agreement between the FRS and SCORE was 55.4% (k=0.183, p<0.001), between the FRS and DAD 70.% (k=0.465, p<0.001), and between SCORE and DAD 72.3% (k=0.347, p<0.001).On the basis of the three algorithms, we detected a high rate of high CV risk, particularly in patients under ART. The FRS was the algorithm that classified most patients in the high CV risk category (20.%). In addition, a high prevalence of MS was identified in this patient group.Copyright © 2019.

Moreover, central characteristics of the MetS like inflammation, obesity and insulin resistance have been associated with the frailty . However, the relationship between MetS and frailty has not yet been studied in detail. Aim of the current analysis within the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) was to explore associations between MetS and frailty taking important co-variables such as nutrition (total energy intake, dietary vitamin D intake), physical activity and vitamin D-status into account.Complete cross-sectional data of 1,486 old participants (50.2% women, 68.7 (65.8-71.3) years) of BASE-II were analyzed. MetS was defined following the joint interim statement of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; American Heart Association; World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society; and International Association for the Study of Obesity in 2009. Frailty was defined according to the Fried criteria. Limitations in physical performance were assessed via questionnaire, muscle mass was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and grip strength using a Smedley dynamometer. Adjusted regression models were calculated to assess the association between MetS and Frailty.MetS was prevalent in 37.6% of the study population and 31.9% were frail or prefrail according to the here calculated frailty index. In adjusted models the odds of being frail/prefrail were increased about 50% with presence of the MetS (OR1.; 95% CI 1.2,1.9; p= 0.002). Moreover the odds of being prefrail/frail were significantly increased with low HDL-C (OR: 1. (95%CI: 1.0-2.3); p = 0.037); and elevated waist circumference (OR: 1.65 (95%CI: 1.1-2.3); p = 0.008).The current analysis supports an association between MetS and frailty. There are various , immune and endocrine alterations in MetS that also play a role in mechanisms underlying the frailty . To what extent cytokine alterations, inflammatory processes, vitamin D supply and hormonal changes in age and in special  states as MetS influence the development of frailty should be subject of further research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641636>Nonfunctioning and Subclinical Cortisol Secreting Adrenal Incidentalomas and their Association with : A Systematic Review.</a></h2><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that nonfunctioning and subclinical cortisol secreting adrenal incidentalomas (AIs) are associated with several components of  resulting in increased cardiometabolic risk.

The underlying condition appears to be an increase in total body uric acid stores and is usually marked by hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia is typically defined as serum uric acid levels greater than 7.0 mg/dL. Gout is more common in men than women and usually has its onset in 4th or 5th decade of life. Approximately 1% of adult Americans report having gout and % have some degree of hyperuricemia. Management of gout can be directed at treatment of acute attacks of gouty arthritis or to long term maintenance therapy directed at preventing attacks or decreasing the risk of uric acid nephropathy or nephrolithiasis. Treatment of acute attacks usually rests on use of nonsteroid antiinflammatory agents such as indomethacin, naproxen, sulindac or celecoxib. Colchicine (1961: Colbenemid and others) is used both during acute episodes and in chronic maintenance therapy. However, the major approach to long term prevention of gout and the complications of uric acid nephropathy is the use of uricosuric acids such as probenecid (1951: Benuryl) and benzbromarone (not available in the United States) and/or inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, such as the xanthine derivative allopurinol (1966: Aloprim) and the newer nonnucleoside xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as febuxostat (2009: Uloric, Adenuric). Newer approaches to gout include use of lesinurad (Zurampic: 2015), a drug that inhibits the reabsorption of uric acid in the distal tubules of the kidney, and use of recombinant enzymes that metabolize uric acid such as pegloticase (Kystexxa), which is used in combination with xanthine oxidase inhibitors ito treat severe gout, and rasburicase (Elitek: 2002) which is used to treat the hyperuricemia associated with tumor lysis  induced by cancer chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620021>Multiple Hits in Acute Pancreatitis: Components of  Synergize Each Other's Deteriorating Effects.</a></h2><p>The incidence of acute pancreatitis (AP) and the prevalence of  (MetS) are growing worldwide. Several studies have confirmed that obesity (OB), hyperlipidemia (HL), or diabetes mellitus (DM) can increase severity, mortality, and complications in AP. However, there is no comprehensive information on the independent or joint effect of MetS components on the outcome of AP. Our aims were (1) to understand whether the components of MetS have an independent effect on the outcome of AP and (2) to examine the joint effect of their combinations.From 2012 to 2017, 1435 AP cases from 28 centers were included in the prospective AP Registry. Patient groups were formed retrospectively based on the presence of OB, HL, DM, and hypertension (HT). The primary endpoints were mortality, severity, complications of AP, and length of hospital stay. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.1257 patients (55.7 ± 17.0 years) were included in the analysis. The presence of OB was an independent predictive factor for renal failure [OR: 2.98 (CI: 1.33-6.66)] and obese patients spent a longer time in hospital compared to non-obese patients (12.1 vs. 10.4 days,  = 0.008). HT increased the risk of severe AP [OR: 3.41 (CI: 1.39-8.37)], renal failure [OR: 7.46 (CI: 1.61-34.49)], and the length of hospitalization (11.8 vs. 10. days,  = 0.020). HL increased the risk of local complications [OR: 1.51 (CI: 1.10-2.07)], renal failure [OR: 6.4 (CI: 1.93-21.17)], and the incidence of newly diagnosed DM [OR: 2.55 (CI: 1.26-.19)]. No relation was found between the presence of DM and the outcome of AP. 906 cases (mean age ± : 56.9 ± 16.7 years) had data on all four components of MetS available. The presence of two, three, or four MetS factors increased the incidence of an unfavorable outcome compared to patients with no MetS factors.OB, HT, and HL are independent risk factors for a number of complications. HT is an independent risk factor for severity as well. Components of MetS strongly synergize each other's detrimental effect.

The prevalence of  in the abdominal obesity and nonabdominal obesity groups were 42.4% and 9.1%, respectively (p = .001). Moreover, eating habits differed between the two groups, with the frequency of vegetable consumption lower in the abdominal obesity than the nonabdominal obesity group (p = .040) and the frequencies of salty and sweet food consumption and of overeating higher in the abdominal obesity than the nonabdominal obesity group. The percentage of participants who exercised for 30 minutes three times per week was 52.% in the abdominal obesity group and 71.4% in the nonabdominal obesity group (p = .024).This observational study found more  risk factors in the abdominal obesity group than the nonabdominal obesity group. Consumption of sweet foods and overeating were higher and the frequencies of vegetable intake and exercise were lower in the abdominal obesity group.

This study was designed to elucidate the prevalence of MetS and its risk factors in young people in urban areas of Pakistan.  A cross-sectional study was conducted in four undergraduate institutions in Lahore, Pakistan. Five hundred and nine young people participated, and each provided their informed consent for the collection of data on their demographic, physical, and biochemical characteristics along with information on their dietary, sleep, and physical activity habits.  Most participants reported consuming greater-than-recommended amounts of protein and smaller-than-recommended amounts of vegetables and fruits. The International Diabetes Federation criteria for MetS were fulfilled by 6.1% of the students. Hypertension (67.7%) and hypo-HDL-emia (64.%) were the most common risk factors. More than 50% of the respondents slept fewer hours per day than recommended, and 33% had a sedentary lifestyle. Men, participants with a family history of  illness and those with low physical activity levels had higher odds of a positive result on screening for MetS.

Up to 10% of individuals with PTEN CS, CS-like , or BRRS have germline SDHx (succinate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial complex II) variants, which modify cancer risk. PTEN contributes to  reprogramming; this is a well-established role in a cancer context. Relatedly, SDH sits at the crossroad of the electron transport chain and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, two central bioenergetic pathways. Intriguingly, PTEN and SDH individuals have reduced SDH catalytic activity, resulting in succinate accumulation; this indicates a common genotype-independent biochemical alteration. Here, we conducted a TCA targeted metabolomics study on 511 individuals with CS, CS-like , or BRRS with various genotypes (PTEN or SDHx, mutant or wild type [WT]) and phenotypes (cancer or ASD) and a series of 187 population controls. We found consistent TCA cycle metabolite alterations in cases with various genotypes and phenotypes compared to controls, and we found unique correlations of individual metabolites with particular genotype-phenotype combinations. Notably, increased isocitrate (p = 1.2 × 10), but reduced citrate (p = .0 × 10), were found to be associated with breast cancer in individuals with PTEN/SDHx. Conversely, increased lactate was associated with neurodevelopmental disorders regardless of genotype (p = 9.7 × 10); this finding was replicated in an independent validation series (n = 171) enriched for idiopathic ASD (PTEN, p = .6 × 10). Importantly, we identified fumarate (p = 1.9 × 10) as a pertinent metabolite, distinguishing individuals who develop ASD from those who develop cancer. Our observations suggest that TCA cycle metabolite alterations are germane to the pathobiology of PTEN-related CS and BRRS, as well as genotype-independent ASD, with implications for potential biomarker and/or therapeutic value.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

DNA, extracted from dried blood cards was collected as part of the regular NBS program. As cystinosis has a prevalence of only 1:100,000-1:200,000, a molecular genetic assay for detection of the SMN1 gene mutation with a higher prevalence was also included in the screening process, a genetic defect that leads to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). First tier multiplex PCR was employed for both diseases. The cystinosis screening employed assays for the three most common  mutations covering 75% of German patients; in case of heterozygosity for one of these mutations, samples were screened by next generation sequencing (NGS) of the CTNS exons for 101  mutations. A detection rate of 98.% is predicted using this approach.Between January 15, 2018 and May 31, 2019, 257,734 newborns were screened in Germany for cystinosis. One neonate was diagnosed with cystinosis, consistent with the known incidence of the disease. No false positive or false negatives were detected so far. Screening, communication of findings to parents, and confirmation of diagnosis were accomplished in a multi-disciplinary setting.

Concentrations of betainized compounds were correlated with intakes of selected nutrients and fiber and measures of  health.Pipecolic acid betaine (PAB) concentrations were significantly higher in the HND group than in the CD group (P = 0.00032) at the end of the intervention and correlated directly (P < 0.0001) with intakes of dietary fiber (r = 0.376) and a biomarker related to whole-grain rye intake, namely the ratio of alkylresorcinol C17:0 to C21:0 (r = 0.442). PAB was associated inversely with fasting plasma insulin consistently at the beginning and at the end of the intervention (P < 0.001, r = -0.300; P < 0.01, r = -0.250, respectively), as well as IL-1 receptor antagonist (P < 0.01, r = -0.232 at the beginning; P < 0.01, r = -0.236 at the end) and serum LDL/HDL cholesterol (P < 0.01, r = -0.239 at the beginning; P < 0.01, r = -0.241 at the end).Among adults with the , PAB plasma concentrations were associated with fasting insulin, inflammation, and lipids and were significantly increased with adoption of the HND.

It is unsettled, however, whether marginal glucose intolerance is implicated in the onset and progression of small fiber dysfunction. Herein, we explored the relationship between glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) and pain sensation in the Japanese population.  A population-based study of 894 individuals (352 men, 542 women; average age 53.8 ± 0. years) and 55 subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in the 2017 Iwaki project were enrolled in this study. Individuals with diabetes were excluded. Relationships between pain threshold for intraepidermal electrical stimulation (P-IES) and parameters associated with  were examined.  P-IES was elevated with increasing of age in women but not in men. Average P-IES (mA) was increased in IFG subjects ( = 55, 0.20 ± 0.03) compared with normoglycemic/non-IFG individuals ( = 894, 0.15 ± 0.11) ( < 0.01). It was comparable between IFG and a group of normal high HbA1c (.9-6.4%). Univariate linear regression analyses showed no influence of sex, triglyceride, or cholesterol on the value of P-IES. In contrast, there were significant correlations between P-IES and serum HbA1c level (ß = 0.120,  < 0.001) Adjustments for the multiple clinical measurements confirmed positive correlation of P-IES with HbA1c (ß = 0.077,  = 0.046).  Individuals with normal high HbA1c exhibited an elevated P-IES in a healthy Japanese population which may be useful for the screening of subclinical DPN.Copyright © 2019 Itabashi, Mizukami, Osonoi, Takahashi, Kudo, Wada, Inaba, Danyang, Uchida, Umetsu, Igawa, Ogasawara, Ryuzaki, Komeda, Ishibashi, Yagihashi and Nakaji.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509430>Rifaximin prevents ethanol-induced liver injury in obese KK-A mice through modulation of small intestinal microbiota signature.</a></h2><p>Exacerbation of alcoholic hepatitis (AH) with comorbid  is an emerging clinical problem, where microbiota plays a profound role in the pathogenesis. Here, we investigated the effect of rifaximin (RFX) on liver injury following chronic-binge ethanol (EtOH) administration in KK-A mice, a rodent model of . Female, 8-week-old KK-A mice were fed Lieber-DeCarli diet (% EtOH) for 10 days, following a single EtOH gavage (4 g/kg BW). Some mice were given RFX (0.1 g/L, in liquid diet) orally. Small intestinal contents were collected from mice without binge. Intestinal microbiota was quantified using conventional, aerobic and anaerobic culturing techniques, and further analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing in detail. EtOH-feeding/binge caused hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and induction of inflammatory cytokines in KK-A mice, which were markedly prevented by RFX treatment. Hepatic mRNA levels for cluster of differentiation (CD)-14, toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, and TLR2 and NADPH oxidase (NOX) 2 were increased following EtOH-feeding/binge, and administration of RFX completely suppressed their increase. The net amount of small intestinal bacteria was increased over 3-fold after chronic EtOH feeding as expected; however, RFX did not prevent this net increase. Intriguingly, the profile of small intestinal microbiota was dramatically changed following EtOH feeding in the order level, where the  predominated in the relative abundance. In sharp contrast, RFX drastically blunted the EtOH-induced increases in the  almost completely, with increased proportion of the . In conclusion, RFX prevents AH through modulation of small intestinal microbiota/innate immune responses in obese KK-A mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559763>Prevalence of  in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients: A Case Control Study from a Tertiary Care Centre in North India.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Along with traditional cardiovascular risk factors and systemic inflammation,  (MetS) contributes to CVD and increased mortality in patients with RA. In this study we determine the prevalence of MetS in RA patients presenting to a tertiary care centre in north India.This is a case control study involving 114 patients of RA with disease duration of ≥1 year and 114 healthy controls who are age and sex matched. Components of MetS were assessed in all the subjects and disease activity of RA was determined by DAS28-ESR. MetS was defined according to modified ATP-III criteria and consensus definition of  for adult Asian Indians.Women constituted 81.6% in RA group and 80.% in control group. Mean age of subjects was 44.81±12.7 years in RA group and 43.27±12.6 years in control group. According to modified ATP-III criteria, 36 (31.6%) RA subjects and 17 (14.9%) controls had MetS (p=0.03). According to the consensus definition of  for adult Asian Indian criteria, 40 (35.1%) RA subjects and 18 (15.8%) controls had MetS (P=0.01).

It is defined as steatosis in over % of hepatocytes. The disease spectrum of NAFLD ranges from simple fatty liver to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis, even hepatic cirrhosis. The disease affects various extra-hepatic systems such as the cardiovascular system and urinary system. Heart-related disease is identified as the leading cause of mortality in NAFLD patients rather than liver-related disease. In this review, we summarize the cardiac abnormalities (structural, functional, arrhythmic cardiac complications etc.) seen in NAFLD patients with the assistance of auxiliary examinations, such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging etc. In addition, the epidemiology of NAFLD and how NAFLD affects the myocardium are also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491867> Unhealthiness Increases the Likelihood of Having  Components in Normoweight Young Adults.</a></h2><p>Findings on risk detection for having  (MetS) components, each of which may individually increase the risk of disease and mortality, are limited in young adults. In this study, we aimed to calculate the likelihood of having ≥1 MetS component in normoweight young adults using two different  health criteria. We recruited 1182 normoweight young adults from the Taiwan Survey on the Prevalence of Hypertension, Hyperglycemia, and Hyperlipidemia and the National Health Interview Survey (aged 16-45 years, 39% male, body mass index = 18.-22.99, all without MetS) and followed them for  years.  health criteria were derived from the Harmonized criteria (unhealthy if showing abnormality in one or two MetS components) and the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG-i; unhealthy if TyG-i was in the >75th percentile). Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimations for having ≥1 MetS component and for having each MetS component in  years were assessed using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. We observed a significantly increased likelihood of the presence of ≥1 MetS component in the unhealthy group by using the Harmonized criteria and TyG-i (adjusted OR (aOR); 95%CI: 2.67; 2.04-3.49 and 2.1; 1.57-2.82, respectively). The areas under the receiver-operating characteristics curves were 0.679 and 0.652 for the final models using Harmonized and TyG-i criteria, respectively. These findings support the recommendation of treating any  component abnormality, even in young adults without a MetS diagnosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579459>Association between food insecurity and  in North West of Iran: Azar Cohort study.</a></h2><p> Nowadays, prevalence of  (MetS) is increasing in the world. There are inconsistence findings about the relationship between food insecurity and MetS. Therefore, the aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the association between food insecurity and MetS in North West of Iran.  The anthropometric measurements, food insecurity, dietary intake, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose (FBS), serum triglyceride and HDL levels of 151 subjects who had participated in Azar cohort study were evaluated. Food security was assessed by Household Food Security Scale (HFIAS) (six-item short questionnaire) and dietary intake (using 24- hour recall questionnaire) of participants. MetS was defined according to National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III report (ATPIII ) criteria.  On the basis of HFIAS and energy, 7.3% and 11.9% of participants were food insecure and hunger, respectively. We observed no significant differences in mean body weight, BMI, waist circumference and FBS between food insecure and secure groups. Moreover, obesity (41.7% vs 30.2%) and MetS (45.% vs 30%) were more prevalent in the food insecure group but the differences were not significant.  The most percent of participants in food insecure were obese and had MetS. However, we could not find significant differences between food insecure and food secure groups. Therefore, for achieving more clear results, further studies with large sample size are needed.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632345>Prevalence of  and Its Determinants in Newly-Diagnosed Adult-Onset Diabetes in China: A Multi-Center, Cross-Sectional Survey.</a></h2><p> The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of  (MetS) and its determinants in newly-diagnosed adult-onset diabetes in China.  From April 2015 to October 2017, 15,492 consecutive patients with diabetes diagnosed within 1 year and aged ≥30 years were recruited from 46 tertiary care hospitals in 24 cities across China. Glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody was assayed centrally and clinical data were collected locally. Classic type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were defined using the criteria of American Diabetes Association, Immunology of Diabetes Society and World Health Organization. MetS was defined using Chinese Diabetes Society's criteria. Logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) of determinants of MetS.  The overall prevalence of MetS was 66.%, with the highest prevalence in T2DM (68.1%), followed by those in LADA (44.3%) and T1DM (34.2%) ( < 0.05 for all comparisons). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, T2DM had a 2.8-fold [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.36-3.37] MetS risk compared with LADA, whereas T1DM had significantly lower OR than LADA (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50-0.92). After further adjustment for insulin resistance, the OR of T2DM vs. LADA was slightly reduced but the OR of T1DM vs. LADA was greatly attenuated to non-significance (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.70-1.33). In addition to types of diabetes, age, gender, geographical residence, education attainment, alcohol consumption and HOMA2-IR were independent determinants of MetS.  MetS was highly prevalent, not only in T2DM but also in T1DM and LADA in Chinese newly diagnosed patients; higher risk of MetS in LADA than in T1DM was partially attributable to higher insulin resistance in LADA.Copyright © 2019 Li, Cao, Tang, Yan, Zhou, Liu, Ji, Yang and Zhou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536825>Long-Term Outcomes of Patients with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Treated with Myeloablative Fractionated Total Body Irradiation TBI-Based Conditioning with a Tacrolimus- and Sirolimus-Based Graft-versus-Host Disease Prophylaxis Regimen: 6-Year Follow-Up from a Single Center.</a></h2><p>Cyclophosphamide (Cy)/etoposide combined with fractionated total body irradiation (FTBI) or i.v. busulfan (Bu) has been the main conditioning regimens for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) for young patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) eligible for a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen. Recent data has suggested that i.v. Bu could be the preferred myeloablative regimen in patients with myeloid malignancies. However, Bu-based regimens are associated with higher rates of sinusoidal obstruction . Here we report long-term survival outcomes of patients with AML receiving FTBI combined with Cy or etoposide before undergoing alloHCT at City of Hope (COH). We obtained a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained institutional registry of clinical outcomes in 167 patients (median age, 41 years; range, 18 to 57 years) with AML in first or second complete remission who underwent alloHCT at COH between 2005 and 2015. Eligible patients received a MAC regimen with FTBI (1320 cGy) and Cy (120 mg/kg) for unrelated donor transplantation or etoposide (60 mg/kg) for related donor transplantation. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was provided with tacrolimus and sirolimus. In this retrospective study, 6-year overall survival was 60% and nonrelapse mortality was 15%. The GRFS rate was 45% at 1 year and 39% at 2 years. We also describe late  effects and report the cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies (9.%). Overall, in this young adult patient population, our results compare favorably to chemotherapy-based (i.v.

The current study aimed to evaluate the relationship between thyroid function using thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) and cardiometabolic risk factors and the clustering of these risk factors () in euthyroid children and adolescents. A total of 250 euthyroid children and adolescents aged 10-18 years were included using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2015. In the unadjusted correlation analyses, TSH was positively correlated with glucose (r = 0.172, P = 0.006), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (r = 0.149, P = 0.018), insulin (r = 0.144, P = 0.023), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (r = 0.163, P = 0.010), and triglyceride (TG) (r = 0.155, P = 0.014), whereas FT4 was negatively associated with the waist circumference (WC) standard deviation score (SDS) (r = -0.134, P = 0.035), body mass index (BMI) SDS (r = -0.126, P = 0.046), insulin (r = -0.219, P < 0.001), and HOMA-IR (r = -0.211, P < 0.001). In the multiple linear regression analysis, TSH was positively associated with glucose (β = 1.179, P = 0.021), HbA1c (β = 0.044, P = 0.039), and TG (β = 8.158, P = 0.041) after adjustment for possible confounders. FT4 was negatively associated with serum fasting insulin (β = -.884, P = 0.017) and HOMA-IR (β = -1.364, P = 0.023) in the multiple linear regression analysis. Boys and girls with elevated glucose levels had a higher adjusted mean TSH level compared to those without elevated glucose levels after controlling for confounding factors in the analysis of covariance (2.16 mIU/L vs 3.88 mIU/L, P = 0.004).

Several previous studies considered the role of selenium in developing MetS. Two selenoproteins, selenoprotein S (SelS), and the Selenoprotein P (SePP) play an important role in antioxidative defense and therefore susceptibility to MetS. The involvement of SNPs in SEPP1 and SEPS1 have not been studied in MetS subjects. This study aims to investigate the association between the risk of MetS and four polymorphisms SEPS1 (rs28665122, rs4965373), SEPP1 (rs7579, rs3877899) in an Iranian population. The sample of this case-control study consisted of 132 Iranian patients with cardiovascular disease (71 MetS and 65 non-MetS subjects) from December 2015 to March 2016. Demographic data, medical history, and para-clinical were measured, and Taqman probes were used for allelic discrimination. The level of the SelS and the SePP were measured by the ELIZA method. No significant differences were found in the genotype frequencies of SEPS1 (rs4965373, rs28665122), SEPP1 (rs7579, rs3877899) in patients with MetS and the non-MetS group.

It most commonly occurs after parotidectomy, but other causes may include submandibular gland surgery, mandibular condylar fracture, obstetric (forceps) trauma, sympathectomy and  disease. Although the pathophysiology of Frey's  remains controversial, the generally accepted hypothesis is that it occurs as the result of injury to the auriculotemporal nerve.There is currently no clear evidence to establish the efficacy and safety of the different methods used for the treatment of Frey's , therefore the prevention of this symptom during surgery is important. The main method used for prevention is the interposition of a graft between the skin flap and the parotid bed during surgery. Biomaterials, allograft or autograft can be used for this purpose.To evaluate the effects and safety of biomaterial, allograft or autograft interposition for the prevention of Frey's  in patients undergoing parotidectomy, and to identify its effect on prevention and delayed occurrence.The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was  February 2019.We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with parotid disease (including tumours, inflammation, trauma etc.) undergoing parotidectomy with a minimal follow-up period of six months. We planned to include trials with interventions including biomaterial, allograft or autograft interposition alone or in combination with other surgical techniques. We included trials that compared any graft interposition and no graft interposition, or different graft interpositions.We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome measures were incidence rate of Frey's  assessed clinically (Minor's starch-iodine test) and other complications (postoperative infection, subjective painful or restricted cervical movement, scar spread, rejection of the graft, complications related to the donor site such as accessory nerve injury and haematoma). Our secondary outcome measures were incidence rate of Frey's  assessed by participants (by questionnaire) and sweating area assessed by Minor's starch-iodine test. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.We included three RCTs (124 participants), two of which we assessed as at high risk of bias and one at unclear risk of bias. All studies were hospital-based and recruited participants undergoing superficial parotidectomy. Most participants were diagnosed with benign lesions of the parotid gland. Participants were followed up for more than six months. The studies evaluated the two comparisons shown below:Sternocleidomastoid muscle flap versus no flapTwo studies assessed this comparison. Both assessed the effects of the sternocleidomastoid muscle flap procedure on the incidence rate of Frey's  assessed clinically but neither showed a significant difference between groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 1.23; 24 participants and RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.73; 36 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We did not pool the data due to the high heterogeneity (I² = 87%).One study found that the sternocleidomastoid muscle flap may result in little or no difference in other complications including haematoma (RR 2.18, 95% CI 0.09 to 50.16; 36 participants; low-certainty evidence), subjective painful or restricted cervical movement (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.05; 36 participants; low-certainty evidence) and scar spread in the cervical region (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.05 to 10.54; 36 participants; low-certainty evidence). Both studies reported the incidence rate of Frey's  assessed by participants, with one reporting no events in either group and the other finding no evidence of a difference (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.26; 36 participants; low-certainty evidence).Acellular dermal matrix versus no graftOnly one study assessed this comparison. Use of an acellular dermal matrix graft may result in little or no difference to the incidence rate of Frey's  (assessed clinically) in comparison with the no graft group, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.25; 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence).Acellular dermal matrix may slightly increase the wound infection rate compared with control (RR 17.00, 95% CI 1.02 to 282.67; 64 participants; low-certainty evidence). Acellular dermal matrix may result in little or no difference to the incidence of seromas or sialoceles (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.66 to 8.23; 64 participants; low-certainty evidence). Acellular dermal matrix may result in little or no difference to the incidence rate of Frey's  (assessed by participants) in comparison with the no graft group (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.04; 64 participants; low-certainty evidence).The evidence for the effectiveness of graft interposition in preventing Frey's  is of low or very low certainty. The use of acellular dermal matrix may be associated with an increase in the wound infection rate, and little or no difference in the incidence of seromas or sialoceles.

Therefore, we aimed to conduct the first dose-response meta-analysis to investigate this effect.A systematic search in PubMed and Web of Science databases from their inception to June 01, 2019, together with relevant literature scrutiny, was performed to identify related studies for inclusion into the meta-analysis. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random effects model. Furthermore, subgroup, sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias analyses were performed. This meta-analysis included 14 cross-sectional and four cohort studies, totaling 284,638 participants and 69,554 MetS cases. The highest versus the lowest carbohydrate intake values were associated with an increased risk of MetS (OR: 1.253, 95% CI: 1.147-1.368), with moderate heterogeneity (I = 54.%). Using dose-response analysis, we found a linear association between carbohydrate consumption and MetS risk with a corresponding OR of 1.026 (95% CI, 1.004-1.048) and with significant heterogeneity (I = 82.0%) at % energy intake from carbohydrates. We have found similar results using subgroup analyses for major study characteristics and adjustment for confounders. Sensitivity analysis further enhanced the robustness of the results, and no publication bias was detected.Carbohydrate intake is associated with an increased risk of developing MetS.

Individuals were classified as inactive, lower or upper insufficiently active, active, and high active. Metabolically unhealthy was defined as having 1 or more of the  criteria, excluding the abdominal obesity criterion.The percentages of metabolically healthy normal-weight (MHNW), metabolically healthy overweight (MHOW), MHO, and MUO in our cohort were 30.8% (63,408 of 205,745), .8% (12,002 of 205,745), 4.1% (8329 of 205,745), and 20.7% (42,564 of 205,745), respectively. During a mean follow-up of 6 (range, 0.-19) years, among 63,408 MHNW participants, 1890 (3.0%) and 1174 (1.9%) developed MUO and MHO, respectively. Among 12,002 MHOW participants, 3404 (28.4%) developed MUO and 2734 (22.8%) developed MHO. A total of 5506 of 8329 (66.1%) participants moved from MHO to MUO, and 5675 of 42,564 (13.3%) moved from MUO to MHO. Compared with being inactive, MHNW individuals who were active or high active showed lower risk for MUO. Among those with MHOW, being high active was associated with reduced risk for MUO and MHO. Although among MHO participants, PA was not associated with incident MUO, being active or high active was linked to a greater likelihood of moving from MUO to MHO.PA may prevent the development of both MHO and MUO. PA also helps increase the transition from MUO to MHO, which may contribute to reduce the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and major cardiovascular disease complications.Copyright © 2019 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

It is characterized by chronic anovulation leading to menstrual disorders, and increased infertility. The  can also manifest as hirsutism and acne.The aim of the study was to compare, over a duration of 6 months, the effects of drospirenone (DRSP) versus chlormadinone acetate (CMA) containing oral contraceptives (OCs) on clinical, hormonal, and  parameters in 120 PCOS women.120 women with the diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam 2003 criteria were recruited to the study. All patients were divided to two treatment groups of OCs, containing: 3 mg DRSP/30 mcg EE (ethinylestradiol) (60 patients) and 2 mg CMA/30 mcg EE (60 patients). Clinical parameters such as hirsutismus and acne were evaluated.  parameters such as serum insulin, glucose concentration, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also measured. Among hormonal parameters, serum estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free thyroxine were measured.The use of both DRSP- or CMA-containing OCs provided similar positive therapeutic effects with regard to clinical, , and hormonal parameters. Among clinical parameters, like hirsutismus, after 6 months of continuous OC treatment, a statistically significant improvement was observed in both groups: DRSP (p <  0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001). In addition, significant improvement was showed according to acne lesions both after DRSP (p < 0.0001) and CMA treatments (p < 0.0001). Among glucose, insulin levels and HOMA-IR, there were statistically significant higher levels in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.05) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.02, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001). Hormonal parameters such as LH, FSH, prolactin, testosterone and DHEA-S were statistically significant lower in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.01, p < 0,002, and p < 0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.04, p < 0.002, and p < 0.0001).Further research, however, is needed not only to define optimal duration, and to clarify the effects of treatment on long-term  outcomes, but also to explore different treatment options and possible combined therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617968>Prevalence of  and Associated Factors in a Cohort of Individuals With Treatment-Resistant Depression: Results From the FACE-DR Study.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of  (MetS) and its components in a cohort of French patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and to determine correlations with sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment-related factors.From 2012 to 2018, 205 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode with moderate-to-severe symptoms (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score ≥ 20), and at least Stage II resistance according to Thase and Rush criteria were enrolled in the FondaMental Advanced Centers of Expertise in Resistant Depression (FACE-DR) cohort. Data on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, lifestyle information, and treatment and comorbidities were collected, and a blood sample was drawn. MetS was defined according to the criteria of the International Diabetes Federation.Overall, 38% of individuals with TRD met criteria for MetS. The frequency of MetS was significantly higher in men than in women only for patients aged 40 years or older (46.3% vs 35.2%, P = .0427). Moreover, whereas the management for diabetes was good, less than one-third of the patients with high blood pressure or dyslipidemia were treated for these conditions. Multivariate analysis showed that individuals with abnormal plasma c-reactive protein levels had a 3-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.-.2) of having MetS, independent of other potential confounders.The prevalence of MetS is higher in patients with TRD than in those with other psychiatric disorders and characterized by a considerable undertreatment of some components of MetS in this population. Diagnosis and treatment of the components of MetS should be systematically performed to prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases in patients with TRD. These findings highlight the need for integrated care, with more interaction and coordination between psychiatrists and primary care providers.© Copyright 2019 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636781>Ezetimibe Monotherapy Reduces Serum Levels of Platelet-Activating Factor Acetylhydrolase in Patients With Dyslipidemia.</a></h2><p>The combination of ezetimibe with statin therapy reduced cardiovascular events compared to statin monotherapy in IMPROVEIT study, and ezetimibe monotherapy attenuated atherosclerosis in basic study. We previously showed ezetimibe monotherapy was especially effective for  (MetS) patients. We investigated the effects of ezetimibe monotherapy for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-chol) function and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) activity.Forty-two patients who initially received ezetimibe (10 mg/day) without statin treatment for 16 weeks from January 2009 to August 2011 were enrolled. Patients were divided into MetS and non-MetS groups, and serum levels of lipids, PAF-AH, and HDL-chol efflux capacity (HDL-CEC) at baseline and after 16 weeks of treatment were investigated. Serum PAF-AH, HDL-associated PAF-AH (HDL-PAF-AH), and LDL-associated PAF-AH (LDL-PAF-AH) were measured.In all patients, age, the percentages of males, and body mass index were 61.0 ± 8.8 years, 59.% and 26.3 ± 3.4 kg/m, respectively. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol) were significantly decreased by ezetimibe monotherapy. Serum PAF-AH and LDL-PAF-AH were significantly decreased by ezetimibe monotherapy, whereas HDL-PAF-AH and HDL-CEC were not. There was no difference in the results of PAF-AH and HDL-CEC between MetS and non-MetS groups.Ezetimibe monotherapy might prevent coronary heart disease (CHD) regardless of the presence of MetS, because PAF-AH was independent risk factor for CHD.Copyright 2019, Tano et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642000> is a predictor of decreased renal function among community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese.</a></h2><p> (MetS) is increasing worldwide with the continuous increase in obesity prevalence. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also a major public health problem, but there is controversy over whether baseline MetS is a predictor of decreased renal function among Japanese community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese.We conducted a prospective cohort study designed as part of the Nomura study. We recruited a random sample of 410 men aged 68 ± 8 (mean ± standard deviation; range, 50-95) years and 549 women aged 69 ± 7 (50-84) years during their annual health examination in a single community. We examined the relationship between baseline MetS and renal dysfunction after a 3-year evaluation based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the CKD-EPI equations modified by the Japan coefficient. CKD was defined as dipstick-positive proteinuria (> or = 1 +) or a low eGFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m).Of the 959 participants, 413 (43.1%) had MetS at baseline. Annual eGFR decline rate was significantly greater in those with MetS than in those without MetS, and the annual eGFR decline rate of < - 1.2 mL/min/1.73 m/year increased significantly in relation to presence of baseline MetS, especially low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). Moreover, the incidence rate of CKD after 3 years was 13.% and increased significantly in relation to presence of baseline MetS, especially its components such as elevated HbA1c. The multivariate-adjusted odd ratio (OR) for CKD in participants with MetS versus those without MetS was 1.55 (0.99-2.43). The multivariate-adjusted ORs for rapid annual eGFR decline rate were significantly high in patients aged ≥ 65 years and presence of medication, regardless of gender and eGFR value.Low HDL-C and elevated HbA1c levels correlated significantly with eGFR decline in a short period of 3 years. MetS also showed a significant association with eGFR decline. This study suggests the importance of low HDL-C and elevated HbA1c in the effect of MetS on eGFR decline rather than obesity among Japanese community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese without CKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611471>Visceral adiposity index and longitudinal risk of incident : Korean genome and epidemiology study (KoGES).</a></h2><p>Available data is insufficient to identify the influence of visceral adiposity assessed by visceral adiposity index (VAI) on incident MetS. This study was to evaluate the association of VAI with incident MetS. In a cohort of Korean genome epidemiology study, ,807 free of MetS were followed-up for 10 years. They were subdivided into 3 tertile groups according to VAI score. Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidential interval (CI) [adjusted HRs (95% CI)] for MetS according to VAI tertiles. Subgroup analyses were conducted for VAI and waist circumference (WC). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) analyses were conducted to compare the discriminative ability for Mets among indices. The risk for MetS increased proportionally to VAI tertiles in all participants, which was similarly observed in both men and women. Subgroup analysis indicated that group with high VAI and low WC had the increased risk for MetS (all participants: 2.76 [2.48-3.07], men: 2.77 [2.40-3.19] and women: 2.55 [2.16-3.00]), compared with groups with low VAI and low WC. Group with low VAI and high WC generally had the higher adjusted HRs for MetS than group with the high VAI and low WC. In AUC analyses, WC had the highest discriminative ability for Mets. In conclusion, elevated VAI was significantly associated with the increased long-term risk of MetS. VAI is a useful supplementary to classic anthropometric indices in screening high risk group of MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552725>Association of Total and High Molecular Weight Adiponectin with Components of  in Mexican Children</a></h2><p>Childhood obesity linked to  alterations, tend to appear simultaneously with altered adipocytokines. suggesting its role in pathogenesis development.

This study aimed to compare FI with the combined glucose-insulin test (CGIT) in horses suspect for ID. We hypothesised that FI would have poor sensitivity for detecting ID compared to CGIT using conventional cut-offs. Records were retrieved from CGITs performed in horses fasted for approximately 8h. Serum insulin and glucose concentrations were measured before and for 150min following an IV bolus of glucose followed by insulin. Correlations between FI and CGIT values were assessed. Youden's index analysis was used to determine the optimal cut-off for FI. Logistic regression and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to determine factors affecting the results. CGITs (n=130) from 62 horses were evaluated. Compared to CGIT, sensitivity and specificity of FI for diagnosis of ID were 14.6% and 100% at a cut-off of 20μIU/mL and 63.4% and 87.2% at a cut-off of .2μIU/mL, respectively. FI was significantly correlated with insulin at 45min (r=0.66) and 75min (r=0.72); area under the curve for insulin (AUC; r=0.67); glucose at 45min (r=0.53); and AUC (r=0.50). Obesity was significantly associated with increased odds of a positive CGIT and horses with a positive CGIT were significantly older (P<0.05). In conclusion, FI correlated well with CGIT results and had adequate sensitivity and specificity at lower cut-offs, despite poor sensitivity at conventional cut-off values. Further research to derive cut-off values relevant to the fasting period is warranted.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Extended Oral Glucose Tolerance Test was performed and showed severe IR. She was then started on metformin 850 mg twice a day, and had repeated OGTT. This showed dramatic worsening of glucose tolerance (e.g. glucose 96 mg/dl versus 187 mg/dl and 68 mg/dl versus 204 mg/dl at 120 and 150 min of OGTT, respectively). This was accompanied by a massive increase of already high insulin concentrations (e.g. from 488.6 to > 1000 µIU/ml, and from 246.8 to > 1000 µIU/ml at 120 and 150 min of OGTT, respectively). Insulin concentrations remained above upper assay detection limit also at 180 min of OGTT on metformin treatment (> 1000 µIU/ml versus 100.6 µIU/ml without metformin).Metformin treatment may paradoxically lead to deterioration of insulin resistance and to development of glucose intolerance in SHORT . Hence, metformin treatment might be potentially harmful in these patients. Though, the precise cause of such profound and paradoxical worsening of glucose tolerance post metformin remains unknown, SHORT  might prove to be an interesting model to study the mechanism(s) of metformin action.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596163>Effect of endothelial dysfunction on the pathogenesis of urolithiasis in patients with .</a></h2><p> The aim of the present prospective clinical study was to investigate the possible effect of endothelial dysfunction in urolithiasis.

This prospective study with three predetermined timepoints and a standardized treatment protocol investigates changes in sleep parameters during the first 2. years of acromegaly treatment.Before initiation of acromegaly treatment (medical pretreatment followed by surgery), polysomnography (PSG) was performed in twenty-seven consecutive patients with treatment-naive acromegaly. PSG was repeated after 1 year (N=24) and 2. years (N=23), and anthropometric and biochemical parameters were obtained.At baseline, 74.1% of the patients was diagnosed with OSAS. The Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI; P 0.001), Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI; P 0.001), lowest oxygen saturation (LSaO2; P 0.007) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; P<0.001) improved significantly during treatment, with the greatest improvement in the first year. After 2. years of treatment, all patients had controlled acromegaly. Of the 16 patients with repeated PSGs and OSAS at baseline, 11 (68.8%) were cured of OSAS. Changes in RDI, ODI, LSaO2, and ESS correlated with IGF-1 levels.OSAS has a high prevalence in active acromegaly. There is a substantial decrease in prevalence and severity of OSAS following acromegaly treatment with the largest improvement during the first year. Most surgically and biochemically controlled patients recovered from OSAS. Therefore, a PSG is advised after diagnosis of acromegaly. When OSAS is present, it should be treated and PSGs should be repeated during acromegaly treatment.© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage . The two diets resulted in different microbiota but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic acid, cholestan-3-ol (β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different -inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and . Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different fat-to-sugar ratios can both cause obesity and prediabetes but enrich different gut microbiota. Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions.

MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (2.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs .0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.2%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2., 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Consecutive gout patients were recruited between August 2017 and December 2018. Demographic information, clinical characteristics and comorbidities were collected. BC was assessed by bioelectric impedance analysis including body fat percentage (BF%), trunk and limb BF%, appendicular skeletal muscle index. Overfat was defined by BF% ≥25% for male and ≥35% for female. The association between BC and serum uric acid (sUA) was evaluated by multiple linear regression.  A total of 362 gout patients were recruited with median age 38 (30, 52) years, 96.1% (348/362) were male. Mean sUA was (551±133) μmol/L. The mean BF% was (25.8±6.4)% with 53.6%(194/362) patients overfat. Male gout patients with overfat showed more affected joints [4(2, 6) vs. 2(2, )], higher sUA [(576±126)μmol/L vs. (523±134) μmol/L], higher prevalence of dyslipidemia [70.1%(131/187) vs. 54.0%(87/161)],  [60.8%(118/187) vs. 28.0%(47/161)], fatty liver [58.2%(113/187) vs. 35.1%(59/161)] and hypertension [44.4%(83/187) vs. 25.%(41/161)] than male patients with normal fat (all <0.05). Their BF%, trunk BF% and limb BF% were positively correlated with the numbers of affected joints, sUA, , fatty liver, and hypertension, respectively (=0.154-0.435, all <0.05). Multivariable linear regression suggested that BF% (=4.29, =0.020) and trunk BF% (=9.11, =0.007), but not limb BF%, were positively correlated with sUA.  Overfat is very common in gout patients. The proportion of trunk fat in male patients is positively correlated with sUA. When assessing obesity in gout patients clinically, body composition analysis should be performed simultaneously.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560151>Health status of workers approximately 60 years of age and the risk of early death after compulsory retirement: A cohort study.</a></h2><p>The increasing number of working elderly people has enhanced the importance of workplace health promotion activities. We investigated the association between the health status of workers approximately 60 years of age and the risk of all-cause mortality after compulsory retirement in Japan.The 2026 participants (1299 males and 727 females) had retired from a metal-products factory at ≥60 years of age. Baseline health examinations were conducted at 60 years of age and included questions about medical history and lifestyle factors; the participants also underwent a physical examination. The participants were followed up annually by mail for an average of 7.4 years. The association between health status at age 60 years and the risk of all-cause mortality was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.During the study, 71 deaths were reported. The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (HR [95% confidence interval]) for all-cause mortality was higher for males (HR, 3.41 [1.73-6.69]) compared with females, participants with a low body mass index (<18. kg/m ; HR 3.84 [1.91-7.73]) compared with normal body weight, smokers (HR, 2.63 [1.51-4.58]) compared with nonsmokers, and those with three or more of four  abnormalities (obesity, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance) (HR 2.29 [1.04-.02]) compared with no  abnormalities. The associations were unaffected by adjustment for these factors.Maintenance of an appropriate body weight, smoking cessation, and elimination of  are required for older workers to prevent early death after retirement.© 2019 The Authors.

There is a relationship between the high activity of this enzyme and the development of obesity and  disorders. The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance,  and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)--((benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats. The in vitro results showed that C1 was a better inhibitor of human 11β-HSD1 than CLX. The ex vivo assay results demonstrated that C1 was capable of reducing 11β-HSD1 overexpression in mesenteric adipose tissue. Therefore, C1 was able to decrease the activity and expression of 11β-HSD1 better than CLX.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31510101>Microbiota, Microbial Metabolites, and Barrier Function in A Patient with Anorexia Nervosa after Fecal Microbiota Transplantation.</a></h2><p>The change in the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites in a patient suffering from severe and enduring anorexia nervosa (AN) and diagnosed with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth  (SIBO) was investigated. Microbial gut dysbiosis is associated with both AN and SIBO, and therefore gut microbiome changes by serial fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a possible therapeutic modality. This study assessed the effects of FMT on gut barrier function, microbiota composition, and the levels of bacterial  products. The patient treatment with FMT led to the improvement of gut barrier function, which was altered prior to FMT. Very low bacterial alpha diversity, a lack of beneficial bacteria, together with a great abundance of fungal species were observed in the patient stool sample before FMT. After FMT, both bacterial species richness and gut microbiome evenness increased in the patient, while the fungal alpha diversity decreased. The total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels (molecules presenting an important source of energy for epithelial gut cells) gradually increased after FMT. Contrarily, one of the most abundant intestinal neurotransmitters, serotonin, tended to decrease throughout the observation period. Overall, gut microbial dysbiosis improvement after FMT was considered. However, there were no signs of patient clinical improvement. The need for an in-depth analysis of the donor´s stool and correct selection pre-FMT is evident.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591635>Does acid reflux precipitate ischaemia in subjects with acute coronary ?</a></h2><p>It has been postulated that gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) may trigger coronary ischaemia through viscerocardiac reflex vasoconstriction in subjects with ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of GORD in subjects with IHD who present with acute coronary  (ACS) and to determine whether GORD may serve as a trigger for ischaemic events.Twenty patients with isolated reflux oesophagitis and 39 with acute coronary  (ACS with concomitant GORD) were studied. Twenty-two subjects comprising normal volunteers and those who were admitted for minor surgical trauma were used as normal controls. All subjects underwent oesophago-gastroduodenal endoscopy (EGD) and acid instillation with hydrochloric acid (0.1 M), as well as nuclear imaging (sestaMIBI) with technetium. Ischaemia was detected by ST depression using ECG monitoring for one hour during and immediately after EGD.Of the 111 subjects with ACS, 39 (35.1%) had erosive GORD and comprised the study group. Subjects with ACS had more incidence of diabetes (p = 0.001), hypertension (p = 0.002), a history of smoking (p = 0.006) and elevated serum triglyceride levels (p = 0.008) compared to the GORD group.

ST depression was documented in 8/39 (20.%) patients in the ACS group and /20 (25%) in the GORD group (p = 0.958). Reversible perfusion defects on sestaMIBI scan were seen in 35.6% of the ACS subjects.Although GORD is common in subjects with ACS, we have not been able to show that GORD may serve as a trigger for ischaemia in these subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571892>Retrospective study of cardiovascular disease risk factors among a cohort of combat veterans with lower limb amputation.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that veterans with lower limb amputation have a higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with population-based controls. American veterans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan with lower limb amputation may be at a similarly higher risk.The Navel Health Research Center (NHRC) maintains the Expeditionary Medical Encounter Database (EMED) of military personnel who have sustained combat limb amputation or serious limb injury during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Department of Veterans Affairs data from 2003 to April 2015 was used to analyze CVD risk factors in this cohort. Veterans with either unilateral (n=442) or bilateral (n146) lower limb amputation were compared to those with serious lower limb trauma without amputation (n=184). Multivariate regression was used to measure associations between lower limb amputation and CVD risk factors over an average of 8 years of follow-up. Outcomes included mean arterial pressure (MAP), low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and serum triglycerides (TG).Compared with the limb injury group, those with unilateral lower limb amputation had significantly lower HDL (<0.05) and higher TG (<0.05). Those with bilateral lower limb amputation had significantly higher MAP (<0.05), lower HDL (<0.01), and higher TG (<0.001). The prevalence of , defined as type 2 diabetes or a constellation of blood pressure and lipid changes consistent with , was 8.7%, 14.9%, and 21.9% for limb injury, unilateral amputation, and bilateral amputation groups, respectively.

Research supports the link between obesity and adverse health outcomes.[1] Obesity is one of the most challenging public health issues not only in the USA but globally. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are 93 million obese adults in the US, representing 39.8% of the adult population. Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of diabetes, heart disease, and is a leading cause of preventable death. Estimates are that the medical cost of obesity ascends to 147 billion dollars per year. There is no medical treatment for obesity that works consistently or in a predictive manner. To date, bariatric surgery is the only known treatment for obesity. Bariatric surgery has gained particular importance due to its success in reversing the abnormal  profile; after bariatric surgery, there is a marked improvement in the management of diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, arthritis, and the .[2] This surgical approach to obesity has been significantly more successful at sustained weight loss in morbidly obese patients compared to diet and medical interventions.[3] Also, there is significant improvement in overall mortality associated with bariatric surgery.[2] However, obese patients have several comorbidities that increase the risk of any surgery; thus, prior to surgery, a preoperative workup is highly recommended.

That cohort of women may be exposed to a greater number of cardiac, obstetric and anesthesio-logical complications, therefore the incidence of medico-legal issues, litigation, liabilities and claims over the past years has significantly risen. Cardiovascular and hormonal changes during pregnancy can challenge even the healthiest of individuals, and in that pregnant population the risk is even greater. These patients should be monitored before the ART, during pregnancy, delivery and puerperium, to avoid heart failure, thrombotic problems, embolic complications, stroke and death. Management issues regarding pregnancy and delivery are elaborate, including anesthesia considerations. This new population of women needs an accurate cardiac risk stratification with a thorough cardiovascular history and examination, 12 lead ECG, and transthoracic echocardiogram.

Male rats that were precociously weaned present neonatal malnutrition and, in adulthood, developed overweight, accumulation of body fat, dyslipidemia, changes in glycemic homeostasis, hyperleptinemia, and increase of vitamin D. As  profile of early-weaned females is not known, we investigated the endocrine- parameters in adolescence and adult female rats of 2 different EW models. Wistar lactating rats and pups from both sexes were separated into 3 groups: non-pharmacological EW (NPEW), dams were involved with a bandage interrupting suckling in the last 3 days of lactation; pharmacological EW (PEW), dams were bromocriptine-treated (0. mg/twice a day via intraperitoneal injection) for 3 days before weaning; and control, dams whose pups ate milk throughout lactation. At 21 days-old, NPEW and PEW females had lower body weight. At 180 days-old, NPEW and PEW females showed higher feed efficiency, weight gain, body fat percentage, and greater accumulation of gonadal and retroperitoneal fat depots associated with adipocyte hypertrophy. NPEW females also showed hyperphagia. Only NPEW females presented hyperleptinemia. Plasma thyroid hormones and vitamin D were unchanged among EW females. Regarding sex hormones, at 45 days-old, no change was found in EW females, while at 180 days-old, PEW females had hypoestrogenemia.

Most studies have focused on advanced stages of wooden breast apparent at market age, resulting in limited insights into the etiology and early pathogenesis of the myopathy. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify early molecular signals in the wooden breast transcriptional cascade by performing gene expression analysis on the pectoralis major muscle of two-week-old birds that may later exhibit the wooden breast phenotype by market age at 7 weeks. Biopsy samples of the left pectoralis major muscle were collected from 101 birds at 14 days of age. Birds were subsequently raised to 7 weeks of age to allow sample selection based on the wooden breast phenotype at market age. RNA-sequencing was performed on  unaffected and 8 affected female chicken samples, selected based on wooden breast scores (0 to 4) assigned at necropsy where affected birds had scores of 2 or 3 (mildly or moderately affected) while unaffected birds had scores of 0 (no apparent gross lesions).

To improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease, we conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in granulosa lutein cells collected from 16 women suffering from PCOS, in comparison to 16 healthy controls. Samples were collected by follicular aspiration during routine egg collection for IVF treatment. Study groups were matched for age and BMI, did not suffer from other disease and were not taking confounding medication. Comparing women with polycystic versus normal ovarian morphology, after correcting for multiple comparisons, we identified 106 differentially methylated CpG sites with p-values <.8 × 10 that were associated with 88 genes, several of which, are known to relate either to PCOS or to ovarian function. Replication and validation of the experiment was done using pyrosequencing to analyse six of the identified differentially methylated sites.

Estimates are that almost 50 to 60% of adults will develop at least one of these harmless growths in their lifetime, with the probability of their occurrence increasing after the fourth decade of life. However, at the very outset, it should be noted that acrochordons occur more commonly in individuals suffering from obesity, diabetes,  (MeTS), and in people with a family history of skin tags. Skin tags affect men and women equally. Acrochordons may appear as early as the teenage years but are most common in the latter part of life. However, many studies have reported that the incidence of skin tags in children and adolescents is increasing. The latter seems to be in concert with the global rise in the incidence of childhood and teenage obesity. Skin tags, on the other hand, are rare after the seventh decade of life. These lesions tend to grow in areas where there are skin folds, such as the axilla, neck, eyelids, and groin. The lesions are skin-colored, brown, and even red ovoid growths that are often pedunculated and attached to a fleshy stalk. Skin tags are small, between 1 and  mm, but rarely can grow to be 1 to 2 centimeters in size. Acrochordons are not painful or tender but can be troublesome all the same. People frequently complain of skin tags getting caught on clothing or jewelry like necklaces. Sometimes the constant friction between the garments and the skin tag may result in bleeding or itching. Certain genetic disorders may have a predisposition to skin tags. In patients with the Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD)  and tuberous sclerosis.[1][2] in addition to other cutaneous and systemic features, acrochordons may be seen in large numbers, often forming a 'necklace' like configuration around the neck- referred to as the 'molluscum pendulum necklace sign.'Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598559>Prevalence and risk factors of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in southwest Iran: a population-based case-control study.</a></h2><p>Few population-based studies have been conducted to report the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and determine its risk factors in Iran, particularly in Shahrekord, southwest Iran. The main aim of this population-based, case-control study was to determine the prevalence of NAFLD and its potential risk factors in an Iranian population-based cohort study in Shahrekord, Iran.We compared 1153 cases with NAFLD at 35 to 70 years to 1153 frequency-matched NAFLD-free controls from a population-based Shahrekord cohort study. Data collection and assessed risk factors (demographics, anthropometrics, clinical and biochemical factors, and laboratory tests) were performed based on the Shahrekord cohort study protocol. Chi-square test, stepwise selection with backward likelihood ratio, logistic regression and log-binomial regression model with 95% confidence interval were performed to determine risk factors with significant effects on NAFLD.In this study, the mean (± standard deviation) age of the participants was 50.23 (±8.70) years. The prevalence of NAFLD and  with 95% confidence interval were 16.47% (15.61-17.36%) and 32.74% (30.83-34.70%), respectively. There was a significant difference in the frequency of waist circumstance, triglycerides, body mass index, blood pressure, and alanine aminotransferase between cases and controls ( < 0.001). According to log-binomial model results, socioeconomic status, hypertension, diabetes, and physical activity were significantly associated with NAFLD.Our findings have important clinical and public health implications in southwest Iran for monitoring the prevalence of NAFLD and important risk factors to manage, screen, prevent, and reduce NAFLD and related factors.Copyright: © 2019 Clinical and Experimental Hepatology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671431>Outcomes of Patients with Central Precocious Puberty due to Loss-of-Function Mutations in MKRN3 Gene After Treatment with Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analog.</a></h2><p>Loss-of-function mutation of MKRN3 represents the most frequent genetic cause of familial central precocious puberty (CPP).

A total of 87 subjects - 39 males, of mean age 45.7±11.6 years and mean BMI 31.4±6.6 kg/m, divided according to glucose tolerance and the presence of MetS were enrolled. Glucose tolerance was studied during OGTT. Anthropometric indices, blood pressure, HbA1c, lipids, hsCRP, sE-selectin, Endothelin-1, and immunoreactive insulin were measured. Body composition was assessed by a bioimpedance method (InBody 720, BioSpace). Tissue AGEs accumulation was evaluated by skin autofluorescence (AGE-Reader, DiagnOpticsTM). CAN was assessed by ANX-3.0 technology. In the groups, according to glucose tolerance, the prevalence of CAN was .7% in normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 8.6% in prediabetes, and 23.% in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (NDD). In the groups, according to the presence of MetS, the prevalence of CAN was 12.3% in those with MetS and 4.8% in those without MetS. Parasympathetic activity was diminished at rest (p=0.048, 0.015, respectively) in NDD as compared to prediabetes and NGT; and there was a numerically elevated heart rate at rest in NDD in comparison to NGT. There was a negative correlation between parasympathetic tone and waist circumference, BMI, and visceral and total fat. There was no difference in the measured endothelial function markers in the groups according to glucose tolerance and MetS. sE-selectin correlated with HOMA-IR (r=0.275, p=0.048). No association between Endothelin-1 levels and assessed  parameters was observed. There is a high prevalence of CAN at early stages of glucose intolerance and in MetS, due to decreased parasympathetic activity. Slight elevation of glycemia and MetS probably do not affect endothelial function, since sE-selectin seems to be related to insulin resistance.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533447>The challenge of multiple cardiovascular risk factor control outside Western Europe: Findings from the International ChoLesterol management Practice Study.</a></h2><p>Comprehensive control of multiple cardiovascular risk factors reduces cardiovascular risk but is difficult to achieve.A multinational, cross-sectional, observational study.The International ChoLesterol management Practice Study (ICLPS) investigated achievement of European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guideline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in patients receiving lipid-modifying therapy in countries outside Western Europe. We examined the rate of, and association between, control of multiple risk factors in ICLPS participants with dyslipidaemia, diabetes and hypertension (N = 2377).Mean (standard deviation) age of patients was 61.4 (10.4) years; 51.3% were male.

The aim of this study was to analyze the ability of six anthropometric indices to identify MetS in the Polish population. The highest odds ratios for the occurrence of MetS, according to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), were noted for the following indices: waist-to-height ratio (WHtR, OR = 24.87) and Clínica Universidad de Navarra-body adiposity estimator (CUN-BAE, OR = 17.47) in men and WHtR (OR = 25.61) and body roundness index (BRI, OR = 16.44) in women. The highest odds ratios for the modified definition of MetS (without waist circumference) were found for the following indices: WHtR (OR = 7.32), BRI (OR = 6.57), and CUN-BAE (OR = 6.12) in women and CUN-BAE (OR = .83), WHtR (OR = .70), and body mass index (BMI, OR = .65) in men ( < 0.001 for all). According to the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses conducted for the identification of MetS, defined in accordance with IDF, the largest areas under the curve (AUCs) in men were observed for WHtR and CUN-BAE indices, whereas in women, they were observed for WHtR and BRI. In the analysis carried out for the identification of MetS (according to modified definition, without waist circumference), the AUCs were larger for WHtR and BRI in women, while in men, they were larger for CUN-BAE, BMI, and WHtR. BMI was also characterized by a relatively strong discriminatory power in identifying individuals with MetS. An optimal cut-off point for MetS, in accordance with the conventional definition, for both sexes was the value of BMI = 27.2 kg/m. The weakest predictor of the  was the ABSI (a body shape index) indicator. The most useful anthropometric indicator for the identification of MetS, both in men and in women in the Polish population, was WHtR. The optimal cut-off points for WHtR equaled 0.56 in men and 0.54 in women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547311>Anti- Effects of Fucoidan from  via Reactive Oxygen Species-Mediated Regulation of JNK, Akt, and AMPK Signaling.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have reported that dietary fiber improved  (MetS). However, the effects of fucoidans on MetS were still not clear. In this study, we evaluated the activity of fucoidan from  (FvF) on attenuating MetS and first elucidated the underlying mechanism. In vitro, FvF treatment remarkably lowered the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with the sodium palmitate (PA)-induced insulin resistance (IR) group. The phosphorylation level of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was significantly decreased, while phosphorylation of protein kinase B (pAkt) level increased, compared with that of the HepG2 cells treated with PA. Thus, FvF increased glucose consumption and relieved IR via ROS-mediated JNK and Akt signaling pathways. In addition, these changes were accompanied by the activation of adenosine '-monophosphate-ativated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream targets (e.g., HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1C)), which improved lipid metabolism in IR HepG2 cells. In vivo, FvF improved hyperglycemia and decreased serum insulin level in mice with MetS. Furthermore, we evaluated the inhibition of glucose transport by in vitro (Caco-2 monolayer model), semi-in vivo (everted gut sac model) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which indicated that FvF could significantly reduce the absorption of glucose into the blood stream, thus it could improve blood-glucose levels and IR in mice with MetS. Moreover, FvF decreased serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and liver lipid accumulation, while increased the serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level in mice with MetS. Therefore, FvF could be considered as a potential candidate for the treatment of MetS by alleviating IR, inhibiting glucose transportation, and regulating lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546147>Prevalence of  and its associated risk factors in an African-Caribbean population with severe mental illness.</a></h2><p>This cross-sectional study aims to determine the prevalence of  (MetS) in patients with severe mental illness (SMI) on a Caribbean island, Curaçao, using the modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Among 350 patients (240 men and 110 women) with a mean age of 51.9 years (S.D.=13.) MetS prevalence was 37.4%, significantly higher in female patients (63.6%) compared to male patients (25.4%). Increased waist circumference was present in 51.1%, low HDL in 50.6%, hypertension in 49.4%, hyperglycemia in 28.6% and 25.7% had hypertriglyceridemia. Except for hypertriglyceridemia, all criteria were more prevalent in female patients. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that female gender, outpatient treatment setting and the absence of substance use disorder were all significant predictors for MetS. Compared to data from the general population obtained by the 2013 National Health Survey Curaçao, this study showed significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in patients with SMI. Moreover, female patients had the highest prevalence of diabetes (28.2%), obesity (50.0%) and increased waist circumference (88.2%). This study demonstrates that African-Caribbean patients with SMI are at high-risk for MetS, especially female patients. Our data suggest to focus on modifiable lifestyle risk factors, as promoting physical activity and healthy dietary habits.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Our laboratory previously developed a controlled-release mitochondrial protonophore (CRMP) that is functionally liver-targeted and promotes oxidation of hepatic triglycerides. Although we previously demonstrated that CRMP safely reverses hypertriglyceridemia, fatty liver, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in diet-induced rodent models of obesity, there remains a critical need to assess its safety and efficacy in a model highly relevant to humans. Here, we evaluated the impact of longer-term CRMP treatment on hepatic mitochondrial oxidation and on the reversal of hypertriglyceridemia, NAFLD, and insulin resistance in high-fat, fructose-fed cynomolgus macaques ( 6) and spontaneously obese dysmetabolic rhesus macaques ( 12). Using positional isotopomer nuclear magnetic resonance tracer analysis (PINTA), we demonstrated that acute CRMP treatment (single dose,  mg/kg) increased rates of hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation by 40%. Six weeks of CRMP treatment reduced hepatic triglycerides in both nonhuman primate models independently of changes in body weight, food intake, body temperature, or adverse reactions. CRMP treatment was also associated with a 20 to 30% reduction in fasting plasma triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in dysmetabolic nonhuman primates. Oral administration of CRMP reduced endogenous glucose production by 18%, attributable to a 20% reduction in hepatic acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) content [as assessed by whole-body β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) turnover] and pyruvate carboxylase flux.

However, they are laborious, time-consuming, and costly. Recently, a new index, single point insulin sensitivity estimator (SPISE) based on TG, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and body mass index (BMI) was proposed in the European population and was found comparable to gold standard test. Decreased insulin sensitivity is a hallmark of  (MetS). Hence, the current study was planned to determine the optimal cutoff of SPISE with high sensitivity and specificity in MetS patients of the North Indian population.A community-based cross-sectional study including 229 MetS cases and 248 controls was conducted. MetS was defined according to the South Asian Modified National Cholesterol Education Program criteria. SPISE index was calculated for cases and controls using the formula devised by Paulmichl .: SPISE = 600 × HDL-C/(TG × BMI). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted for determining optimal cutoff for SPISE in MetS.SPISE was significantly lower in MetS patients (.35 ± 1.35) than that for controls (7.45 ± 2) with  < 0.05 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.79-2.41). ROC curve showed area under the curve = 0.83 for SPISE ( < 0.05, CI: 0.79-0.86), showing SPISE to have good predictive ability to discriminate MetS cases from controls. The cutoff value of SPISE index for predicting insulin sensitivity in MetS was found out to be .82 with sensitivity and specificity of 73% and 80%, respectively. This cutoff is lower than the European population (6.61), indicating higher insulin resistance (IR) in the study population.SPISE could be a useful potential low-cost indicator with high sensitivity and specificity for predicting IR in MetS.Copyright: © 2019 Journal of Laboratory Physicians.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589129>Mechanism Underlying the Formation of a Cluster of .</a></h2><p>The concept of  (MetS) as a cluster of risk factors of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases has undergone some evolutionary transformations over the past years. Integrating the autonomic dysfunction into the pathogenesis of MetS creates the possibility of including a range of nosologies affecting treatment and clinical manifestations of pathologies belonging to MetS into the MetS cluster The purpose of this work is to determine the involvement of autonomic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of associated pathological conditions in patients and MetS.A cross-sectional study was conducted. The sample consisted of 158 patients with . The patients underwent a physical examination, including BMI; a blood chemistry test with the determination of the hormonal status (insulin, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone); a 24-hour monitoring of blood pressure (BP); an assessment of heart rate variability; studies showing the presence of gastric reflux (рН-measurement) or its damaging impact (endoscopy); men were tested with the IPSS-QOL questionnaire and underwent transrectal ultrasound of the prostate and ultrasound of the bladder.It is revealed that because of MetS, the occurrence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy reaches 37.%. Some features of gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients with MetS are shown. Regurgitation prevails in the structure of complaints. In case of fibrogastroduodenoscopy, an endoscopy-negative form of the disease occurs in 38%. According to the data of daily pH-measurement, when DeMeester score is high, in the supine position, 25% of time accounts for alkaline reflux (рН > 7). It is found out that young men experience the enlargement of prostate volume and size; according to the IPSS questionnaire, the scores correspond to the initial manifestations of hyperplastic diseases of the prostate gland due to insulin resistance and normal level of androgens.The paper demonstrates that the autonomic dysfunction of nervous system (on a par with insulin resistance) is the main link in the development of MetS. This provides the basis for including the mentioned states - cardiac autonomic neuropathy, lower urinary tract symptoms and gastroesophageal reflux disease - into the MetS cluster.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668390>Rfx6 promotes the differentiation of peptide-secreting enteroendocrine cells while repressing genetic programs controlling serotonin production.</a></h2><p>Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) of the gastro-intestinal tract sense gut luminal factors and release peptide hormones or serotonin (-HT) to coordinate energy uptake and storage. Our goal is to decipher the gene regulatory networks controlling EECs specification from enteroendocrine progenitors. In this context, we studied the role of the transcription factor Rfx6 which had been identified as the cause of Mitchell-Riley , characterized by neonatal diabetes and congenital malabsorptive diarrhea. We previously reported that Rfx6 was essential for pancreatic beta cell development and function; however, the role of Rfx6 in EECs differentiation remained to be elucidated.We examined the molecular, cellular, and  consequences of constitutive and conditional deletion of Rfx6 in the embryonic and adult mouse intestine. We performed single cell and bulk RNA-Seq to characterize EECs diversity and identify Rfx6-regulated genes.Rfx6 is expressed in the gut endoderm; later, it is turned on in, and restricted to, enteroendocrine progenitors and persists in hormone-positive EECs. In the embryonic intestine, the constitutive lack of Rfx6 leads to gastric heterotopia, suggesting a role in the maintenance of intestinal identity. In the absence of intestinal Rfx6, EECs differentiation is severely impaired both in the embryo and adult. However, the number of serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells and mucosal -HT content are increased. Concomitantly, Neurog3-positive enteroendocrine progenitors accumulate. Combined analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA-Seq data revealed that enteroendocrine progenitors differentiate in two main cell trajectories, the enterochromaffin (EC) cells and the Peptidergic Enteroendocrine (PE) cells, the differentiation programs of which are differentially regulated by Rfx6. Rfx6 operates upstream of Arx, Pax6 and Isl1 to trigger the differentiation of peptidergic EECs such as GIP-, GLP-1-, or CCK-secreting cells. On the contrary, Rfx6 represses Lmx1a and Tph1, two genes essential for serotonin biosynthesis. Finally, we identified transcriptional changes uncovering adaptive responses to the prolonged lack of enteroendocrine hormones and leading to malabsorption and lower food efficiency ratio in Rfx6-deficient mouse intestine.These studies identify Rfx6 as an essential transcriptional regulator of EECs specification and shed light on the molecular mechanisms of intestinal failures in human RFX6-deficiencies such as Mitchell-Riley .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The study was conducted in two phases. In phase 1, the DIs received a tutorial on the use of human-centered approach in designing mobile health applications. In phase 2, the DIs were provided a case study for which they designed an app for patients to manage  using a human centered approach. The goal of phase 2 was to identify the features that were believed to be most important when designing this  app. An initial questionnaire was administered to the DIs to gather information on their socio-demographics, prior training in nutrition, smart phone usage, perceptions about food logs, and calorie intake calculations. Subsequent questionnaires gathered information from the DIs on their preferred diet app components, app features, rankings of the features, and mock representations of the diet app with the selected features.The DIs were enrolled in the supervised practice component of their training to be Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs). Fifty percent of them had previously worked in a nutrition-related field. One-third of them were currently using a nutrition app. The top five features of the proposed diet app which the DIs identified as very important included (I) personalization of the app based on user preferences (80%, n=8); (II) disease specific education tips (90%, n=9); (III) ability to track progress (80%; n=8); (IV) reminders (70%, n=7) and (V) reinforcement based on user feedback (50%, n=). In translating the identified features into functional requirements, majority of the DIs felt that the five key features identified should incorporate the following components: (I) personalization of the app should comprise information on medical factors, personal information, personal preferences, and recording weights; (II) disease specific educational tips should comprise information on food selections, low sodium options, and recipes for diabetes; (III) tracking progress should comprise features for storing audio files, viewing previous logs and uploading photos into a library; (IV) reminders should comprise daily messages to the users from the app; and (V) reinforcement should comprise provisions to enter motivational messages.Our study lends support to the need for utilizing human-centered design (HCD) approaches in developing e-health dietary apps as well other non-diet related apps. App developers are encouraged to incorporate user characteristics, needs and preferences using a HCD framework that will allow for reproducibility, tailoring, user satisfaction, and effectiveness assessments.2019 mHealth.

MetS was prevalent in 72 (14.1%) of the ACHD population (34 female, 15.%). Regarding severity class, patients with simple forms of CHD had a MetS prevalence of 11.8%, moderate 16.7%, and severe 13.8%. ACHD with MetS had significantly increased cIMT compared to ACHD without MetS (ACHD with MetS: 0.587 ± 0.079 mm, ACHD without MetS: 0.560 ± 0.087 mm, mean difference: 0.028 mm, P = .013). Such a difference in vascular structure corresponds to roughly five years of normal vascular aging of the vessels.ACHD with MetS have a thicker cIMT compared to ACHD without MetS. Screening for MetS and targeting risk factors in ACHD might help to prevent structural alterations of the vessels at an early stage.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493945>Genetic and phenotypic features of patients with childhood ataxias diagnosed by next-generation sequencing gene panel.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this prospective study was to identify the characteristics of pediatric recessive ataxias and the mutations leading to them.Eighty-four pediatric patients aged 0-18 years presenting to our clinic, evaluated by means of imaging,  or pathological investigation, or single-gene test, in whom Friedreich's ataxia was excluded, and predicted to carry the progressive autosomal recessive ataxia gene were included in the study.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered to be a phenotype of Mets in the liver. Although there have been some reports of the association between NAFLD and light alcohol consumption (LAC), the association between Mets-related diseases and LAC in the subjects with and without fatty liver is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the influence of LAC on Mets-related diseases in individuals with and those without fatty liver. This study included 1,190 men who underwent regular health check-ups and consumed <20 g/day of alcohol. The subjects were divided into two groups, the non-fatty liver group and fatty liver group, and investigated the association between Mets-related diseases and LAC. Fatty liver was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound. The effect of LAC was different between the non-fatty liver and fatty liver groups. In the non-fatty liver group, the odds ratio (OR) for hypertension was 1.73 (1.04-2.88;2 P=0.035). In the fatty liver group, the OR for each Mets-related diseases were as follows: Dyslipidemia, 0.64 (0.44-0.95, P=0.028); impaired glucose tolerance 0.57 (0.37-0.88; P=0.012); chronic kidney disease, 0.58 (0.36-0.94; P=0.029); and Mets by Japanese criteria, 0.63 (0.44-0.92; P=0.016).

Those who had undergone a prior biopsy or surgery for prostate disease, were suspected of having urinary tract infection, or were taking BPH/LUTS or  medications were excluded. BPH/LUTS was defined as an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of ≥8 and a prostate volume (PV) of ≥30 cm.The subjects had a mean age of 54.1 years, PV of 29.2 cm, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 1.20 ng/mL, and IPSS of 9.2. The annual PV growth rate was 0.48 cm/year. Age, body mass index (BMI), PSA, basal  rate, apolipoprotein A-1, fasting blood glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were significant predictive factors for PV. Age, PSA, apolipoprotein B, fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, HDL, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were predictors of BPH/LUTS at the initial health examination.

The CHADS-VASc score does not account for the MetS components of prehypertension, prediabetes mellitus, abdominal obesity, elevated triglycerides, and low HDL (high-density lipoprotein). Data are limited on the association of MetS with stroke in AF, independent of CHADS-VASc variables. Our aim was to identify MetS components associated with ischemic stroke in participants with AF in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities). Methods- We included 1172 participants with incident AF within  years of measurement of MetS components. MetS was defined by ATP criteria and International Diabetes Federation criteria. Incident ischemic stroke was physician adjudicated. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association of MetS components with stroke. Results- After a median follow-up of 14.8 years, there were 113 ischemic stroke cases. Of the individual MetS components, low HDL was borderline associated with increased stroke risk (hazard ratio, 1.48 [95% CI, 0.99-2.21]) after adjustment for CHADS-VASc variables while the remaining MetS variables were not associated with stroke risk. The presence of ≥3 components of MetS was not significantly associated with ischemic stroke after adjustment for CHADS-VASc variables (hazard ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 0.91-2.11]). The risk of stroke increased by 13% for each additional component of MetS; however, this association was borderline significant (hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.99-1.28]). Conclusions- The presence of MetS was not significantly associated with ischemic stroke after adjustment for CHADS-VASc variables.

The principal risk factor for development of  is obesity, defined as a state of pathological hyperplasia or/and hypertrophy of adipose tissue. The number of mature adipocytes is determined by adipocyte differentiation from preadipocytes. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of curcumin on adipogenesis and the underlying mechanism. To examine cell toxicity of curcumin, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with 0-50 µM curcumin for 24, 48, or 72 h, then cell viability was measured using the MTT (3-(4,-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The effect of curcumin on the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. Curcumin-induced cell apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL assay and curcumin-induced caspase activation was measured by immunoblotting. The effect of curcumin on adipocyte differentiation was determined by measuring mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), expression of adipogenic transcription factors, and lipid accumulation. Results showed the viability of preadipocytes was significantly decreased by treatment with 30 µM curcumin, a concentration that caused apoptosis in preadipocytes, as assessed by the TUNEL assay, and caused activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3. A non-cytotoxic dose of curcumin (15 µM) inhibited MCE, downregulated the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, prevented differentiation medium-induced β-catenin downregulation, and decreased the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In conclusion, our data show that curcumin can induce preadipocyte apoptosis and inhibit adipocyte differentiation, leading to suppression of adipogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522168> and Mortality in Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis Patients: A -Year Prospective Cohort Study.</a></h2><p> (MS) has been widely proved as a predictor of cardiovascular disease, all-cause, and cardiovascular mortality in general population. But its effects on mortality and technique failure have not been well illustrated in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We aimed to investigate the association of MS and clinical outcomes in Chinese continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) patients.A single-center, prospective, observational cohort study was conducted in CAPD patients enrolled from September 1 to December 31, 2011, and followed up until December 31, 2016. Demographic, clinical, biochemical and anthropological data were collected. The relationships between MS and mortality and technique failure were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox Regression Survival Functions.A total of 511 patients were enrolled. The baseline mean age was 48.4 ± 14.4 years, 282 patients (55.2%) were male, and 130 patients (25.4%) were diabetic. In total, 213 patients (41.7%) met the diagnostic criterion of MS. During a median of 4.4 years (interquartile range 2.3-.3 years) follow-up period, 114 patients died, of whom, 65 patients (48%) died in MS group versus 49 patients (30%) in non-MS group. Patients who died tended to be older, higher in inflammation markers and with poorer nutritional state. Kaplan-Meier Survival Functions found patients with MS had a significant rising of all-cause mortality (log-rank test = 12.811, p < 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (log-rank test = 14.529, p < 0.001) in all patients, and a significant rising of cardiovascular mortality (log-rank test = 4.486, p = 0.034) in non-diabetic patients. After adjusting for confounders, Cox Regression showed that MS was significantly associated with higher cardiovascular mortality in all patients (hazard ratio [HR] 2.21, 95% CI 1.12-4.36, p = 0.022) and in non-diabetic patients (HR 2.60, 95% CI 1.07-6.35, p = 0.036), but it has no significant effect on technique failure.In CAPD patients, MS predicted mortality, especially cardiovascular mortality.

The failure of preclinical approaches to provide significant sepsis survival benefit in the clinic is often attributed to inappropriate animal disease models. It has been demonstrated that high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) blockade can reduce inflammation, mortality and morbidity in experimental sepsis without promoting immunosuppression. Within this study, we explored the use of ovine anti-HMGB1 antibodies in a model of ovine septic shock incorporating intensive care supports (OSSICS). Results: Septic sheep exhibited elevated levels of HMGB1 within 12 h after the induction of sepsis. In this study, sepsis was induced in six anaesthetized adult Border Leicester × Merino ewes via intravenous instillation of  and sheep monitored according to intensive care unit standard protocols for 26 h, with the requirement for noradrenaline as the primary endpoint. Septic sheep exhibited a hyperdynamic circulation, renal dysfunction, deranged coagulation profile and severe  acidosis. Sheep were assigned a severity of illness score, which increased over time. While a therapeutic effect of intravenous anti-HMGB1 antibody could not be observed in this model due to limited animal numbers, a reduced bacterial dose induced a septic  of much lower severity. With modifications including a reduced bacterial dose, a longer timeframe and broad spectrum antibiotics, the OSSICS model may become a robust tool for preclinical assessment of sepsis therapeutics.Copyright: © Stevens et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632116> With Aortic Arterial Stiffness And First Hospitalization Or Mortality In Coronary Artery Disease Patients.</a></h2><p> (MetS) and aortic arterial stiffness (AS) are risk factors for future cardiovascular events. We evaluated their roles in first hospitalization or all-cause mortality prediction in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.From January to December 2012, 115 CAD patients were enrolled from a single center and followed up for . years. The composite endpoint included hospitalization for unstable angina, myocardial infarction, revascularization, or heart failure and all-cause mortality. Patients with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity > 10 m/s (measured using applanation tonometry) constituted the high AS group.During a median 54-month follow-up, there were 43 (37.4%) and 11 (9.6%) hospitalization and mortality events, respectively. Overall, 41 (35.7%) and 70 (60.9%) patients were diagnosed with AS and MetS, respectively. CAD patients with high AS had higher diabetes and MetS percentages, were older, and had higher waist circumference and systolic blood pressure (SBP) but lower glomerular filtration rate than those with low AS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed old age ( < 0.001), diabetes ( = 0.003), and high waist circumference ( = 0.044) and SBP ( = 0.007) as independent predictors of AS in CAD patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that CAD patients with concurrent MetS and high AS had a higher risk for hospitalization (log rank test,  = 0.005) or developing all-cause mortality (log rank test,  = 0.002). Compared with CAD patients without MetS or AS, composite outcome development risk in those with both the conditions was 10.2-fold higher ( < 0.001); this risk was 6.54-fold higher in those with AS alone ( = 0.007).In CAD patients, age, diabetes, and high waist circumference and SBP are the independent predictors of AS.

The co‑administration of ticagrelor or prasugrel with statins in the clinic has already drawn a great deal of attention. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the safety and effectiveness, and guide the rational clinical use of, co‑administration of ticagrelor or prasugrel with statins by exploring potential drug interactions. The activity of cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A member 4 (CYP3A4) was detected, and its protein and mRNA expression levels were measured in a rat model and liver microsomes to evaluate the effect of the drug combinations on CYP3A4. High performance liquid chromatography, western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR were used to perform these investigations. The in vitro experiments suggested that ticagrelor inhibited CYP3A4 activity, with IC50 and inhibitor constant (Ki) values of 68.74 and 26.47 µM, respectively; prasugrel also inhibited CYP3A4, activity with IC50 and Ki values of 16.24 and 10.84 µM, respectively. When different dosages of the antagonists were combined with simvastatin or atorvastatin, the  rate was reduced more effectively at higher dosages when compared with lower dosages. An in vivo pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the co‑administration of ticagrelor or prasugrel with simvastatin caused an increase in the principal pharmacokinetic parameters of the probe drug dapsone [area under the concentration/time curve (AUC)0‑t, AUC0‑∞ and t1/2] and a decrease in clearance compared with ticagrelor, prasugrel or simvastatin alone. Additional studies confirmed that the two investigated P2Y12 inhibitors were able to decrease the protein level of CYP3A4 by promoting protein degradation through the proteasomal pathway, and combination with statins such as simvastatin had a synergistic inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 activity. These results demonstrated that the co‑administration of P2Y12 inhibitors with simvastatin could markedly inhibit the activity of CYP3A4, and these findings will further influence the assessment of the clinical effectiveness (reduced or enhanced efficacy) and safety (bleeding and rhabdomyolysis) in the clinic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536280>Excited (Agitated) Delirium.</a></h2><p>The understanding of delirium is as a complex neuropsychiatric  that is characterized by disturbances in consciousness, orientation, memory, thought, perception and behavior resulting from or more structural and/or physiological abnormalities directly or indirectly affecting the brain. It is quite prevalent in medical and surgical settings and is associated with high rates of death and healthcare costs.[1] Delirium is defined as a unitary , whereby a range of different etiological produces a relatively consistent pattern of acute generalized cognitive disturbances. Delirium was introduced as an umbrella term encompassing all such disturbances and thus subsumed a range of synonyms that had previously been in use (acute confusion, ICU psychosis, acute brain failure, septic encephalopathy, etc.). However, despite these commonalities, the symptom profile, course, and outcome of delirium is highly heterogenous. Consequently, interest has focused on identifying clinically meaningful subtypes. Disturbances of motor behavior are an important and highly visible feature of delirium that physicians have recognized since ancient times with the terms ‘phrenitis,’ and ‘lethargus’ used to denote agitated/hyperactive vs. somnolent/hypoactive presentations respectively. To date, there have been many studies of motor defined clinical subtypes of delirium, which suggests that they differ significantly regarding frequency and severity of non-motoric symptoms, etiology, pathophysiology, detection rates and treatment experience.[2] Delirium characteristically demonstrates a cluster of symptoms of which the ’core’ symptoms, which more frequently present include fluctuating levels of consciousness, inattention and disorientation, sleep-wake cycle disturbances, memory impairment, and motor activity changes. Other features that are more variable in their presentation are perceptual disturbances, thought process abnormalities, and affective disturbances.[3] The term “excited delirium” first appeared in 1985.[4] The term gained popularity in academic literature in the late 1980s as cocaine, and other sympathomimetic drugs gained popularity in the United States and a movement toward the de-institutionalization of the chronically mentally ill occurred.[] Excited delirium  is a disease state characterized by a constellation of delirium, agitation, and hyperadrenergic autonomic dysfunction. The cause of excited delirium is multifactorial and secondary to a complex interaction of co-morbid, and acute-on-chronic medical conditions, including psychiatric, neurologic, toxicologic, thermal, and  derangement. In 1849, Dr. Luther Bell, the primary psychiatrist at McLane Asylum for the Insane, introduced the disease into medical literature under the name "Bell mania." It correlates with elevated morbidity and mortality that is at least in part independent of underlying medical morbidity and premorbid cognitive status.[6]Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651274>A real-world evaluation of a tertiary care childhood obesity intervention to reduce  risk in a hard-to-reach urban population.</a></h2><p>Research on outcomes associated with lifestyle interventions serving pediatric populations in urban settings, where a majority have severe obesity, is scarce. This study assessed whether participation in a lifestyle intervention improved body mass index (BMI) percentile, BMI z-score, blood pressure, and lipid levels for children and adolescents.The Live Light Live Right program is a lifestyle intervention that uses medical assessment, nutritional education, access to physical fitness classes, and behavioral modification to improve health outcomes. Data was analyzed for 144 subjects aged 2-19 who participated for a minimum of 12 consecutive months between 2002 and 2016. McNemar tests were used to determine differences in the proportion of participants who moved from abnormal values at baseline to normal at follow-up for a given clinical measure. Paired sample t-tests assessed differences in blood pressure and lipid levels. Multiple linear regression assessed the change in blood pressure or lipid levels associated with improvement in BMI% and BMI z-score.The majority were female (62.%), mean age was 9.6, and 71% were Black.

The objective of this study was to examine if intestinal adaptation could be demonstrated as increase in intestinal absorption of energy and wet weight over time measured by repeated  balance studies (MBSs) and to examine whether adaptation was determined by the anatomy of the remnant bowel.We retrospectively analyzed data from 48 repeated MBSs performed in 13 adult patients with SBS. Results were presented graphically and interpreted. The interpatient and intrapatient heterogeneity was compared based on anatomy of the remnant bowel.The number of repeated MBSs ranged from 2 to 7, and time between last intestinal resection and MBS from  months to 18.1 years. In 6 patients, the first MBS was performed within 2 years after last resection, but only 1 patient had repeated MBSs within this period. Nine patients had an end jejunoileostomy, and 4 patients had a jejuno-colonic or ileo-colonic anastomosis. None of the patients had jejunoileal anastomosis with a preserved ileocecal valve. Interpatient and intrapatient heterogeneity of wet weight and energy absorption was larger in patients without colon in continuity. The wet weight and energy absorption data showed no tendency toward intestinal adaptation in any anatomical group.We observed no signs of late-phase intestinal adaptation in this selected group of patients with SBS. Future prospective MBSs are needed to understand the time course and magnitude of intestinal adaptation.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565431>Comparative Abilities of Body Mass Index, Waist Circumference, Abdominal Volume Index, Body Adiposity Index, and Conicity Index as Predictive Screening Tools for  among Apparently Healthy Ghanaian Adults.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of the  (MetS) continues to increase. There is therefore the need for early detection to avert possible adverse outcomes. Several anthropometric methods have been suggested to predict MetS, but no consensus has been reached on which is best. The aim of the study was to explore the comparative abilities of conicity index, body adiposity index, abdominal volume index, body mass index, and waist circumference in predicting cardiometabolic risk among apparently healthy adults in the Tamale metropolis. This study was a cross sectional study conducted from September 2017 to January 2018, among one hundred sixty (160) apparently healthy normoglycemic normotensive adults. A self-designed questionnaire was administered to gather sociodemographic data. Anthropometric and haemodynamic measurements were also taken. Blood samples were collected for fasting blood glucose (FBG) and lipid profile. MetS was classified using the harmonised criteria as indicated by the joint interim statement (JIS). Of 160 participants, 42.% were male and 57.% were female. Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) associated better with MetS and other cardiovascular risk factors. Generally, BMI and WC showed largest area under curves (AUCs) than abdominal volume index (AVI), body adiposity index (BAI), and conicity index (CI) in predicting MetS and its components. Upon gender stratification, AVI and CI had the larger AUCs in females whiles BMI remained the superior index in males. Whiles BMI and WC remained useful parameters, they were not useful in predicting MetS and its components in the female population in this study.Copyright © 2019 Lawrence Quaye et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535207>Association between body size- phenotype and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and significant fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Body size- phenotype may help predict whether or not individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) develop advanced liver disease.

Clinical, genetic, and histological characteristic features of NAFLD were evaluated. The metabolically unhealthy phenotype was defined by the presence of two or more  components, while body size was categorized based on body mass index: obese (≥ 25 kg/m) or non-obese (< 25 kg/m). Body size- phenotypes were divided into four study groups: (1) non-obese  (MS)-, (2) non-obese MS+ , (3) obese MS-, and (4) obese MS+.Obese MS- and non-obese MS+ groups demonstrated comparable levels of insulin resistance, adipose tissue insulin resistance indexes, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) areas. The VAT area was significantly higher in the obese MS+ group versus obese MS- group. However, the VAT to subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) ratio was highest in the non-obese MS+ group.

Cystinosis is caused by mutations in the CTNS gene that encodes the lysosomal cystine carrier protein cystinosin. CTNS mutations result in either complete absence or reduced cystine transporting function of the protein. The diagnosis of nephropathic cystinosis is generally based on measuring leukocyte cystine level, demonstration of corneal cystine crystals by the slit lamp examination and confirmed by genetic analysis of the CTNS gene.A boy born to consanguineous Caucasian parents had the characteristic clinical features of the infantile nephropathic cystinosis including renal Fanconi  (polydipsia/polyuria,  acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, low molecular weight proteinuria, glycosuria, cystine crystals in the cornea) and elevated WBC cystine levels. Initially we performed RFLP analysis of the common in the Northern European population 57-kb deletion of proband's DNA, then a direct Sanger sequencing which revealed no mutations in the coding part of the CTNS gene. To confirm the diagnosis we performed RT-PCR analysis of total RNA obtained from patient-derived fibroblasts in combination with cDNA sequencing. This revealed the skipping of exon 4 and exon  in the CTNS in our patient. Therefore, we detected a novel 9-kb homozygous deletion in the CTNS gene at genomic DNA level, spanning region from intron 3 to intron . In order to identify the inheritance pattern of the deletion we analyzed DNA of proband's mother and father. Both parents were found to be heterozygous carriers of the CTNS mutation.Analysis of CTNS gene transcript allowed to identify a large homozygous deletion in the patient with infantile nephropathic cystinosis.

This study evaluated the effects of a chemically characterized OLE in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice, describing the underlying mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects, with special attention to vascular dysfunction and gut microbiota composition.C57BL/6J mice were distributed in different groups: control, control-treated, obese and obese-treated with OLE (1, 10 and 25 mg/kg/day). Control mice received a standard diet, whereas obese mice were fed HFD. The treatment was followed for  weeks, and animal body weight periodically assessed. At the end of the treatment,  plasma analysis (including lipid profile) as well as glucose and insulin levels were performed. The HFD-induced inflammatory status was studied in liver and fat, by determining the RNA expression of different inflammatory mediators by qPCR; also, different markers of intestinal epithelial barrier function were determined in colonic tissue by qPCR. Additionally, flow cytometry of immune cells from adipose tissue, endothelial dysfunction in aortic rings as well as gut microbiota composition were evaluated. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to antibiotic-treated mice fed with HFD was performed.OLE administration reduced body weight gain, basal glycaemia and insulin resistance, and showed improvement in plasma lipid profile when compared with HFD-fed mice. The extract significantly ameliorated the HFD-induced altered expression of key adipogenic genes, like PPARs, adiponectin and leptin receptor, in adipose tissue. Furthermore, the extract reduced the RNA expression of Tnf-α, Il-1β, Il-6 in liver and adipose tissue, thus improving the tissue inflammatory status associated to obesity. The flow cytometry analysis in adipose tissue corroborated these observations. Additionally, the characterization of the colonic microbiota by sequencing showed that OLE administration was able to counteract the dysbiosis associated to obesity. The extract reversed the endothelial dysfunction observed in the aortic rings of obese mice. FMT from donors HFD-OLE to recipient mice fed an HFD prevented the development of obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction.OLE exerts beneficial effects in HFD-induced obesity in mice, which was associated to an improvement in plasma and tissue  profile, inflammatory status, gut microbiota composition and vascular dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a refined laying hen model was employed to permit further investigations. Intramuscular (i.m.) injections of exogenous oestrogen as β-estradiol-17-dipropionate (E) ( mg/kg BW) were given every 4 days for 20 days to 30-week-old hens fed either  or with restricted feed intake. Elevated (< 0.01) plasma oestrogen concentrations produced significant macroscopic and microscopic hepatic alterations. Hens in the E-treated  fed (EAL) group experienced a higher incidence of FLHS than hens in the E-treated restricted feed intake group, showing that birds with a higher feed intake are more at risk of developing FLHS. Histological examination of livers revealed that hens in the E-treated  fed group had consistent and severe fat infiltration in the liver, and fat vacuolization within hepatocytes. Fat accumulation and fat droplets were found not only in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes but also in liver sinusoids. White blood cell counts and fibrinogen concentrations were altered (< 0.01) in hens treated with E when compared with controls. Plasma fibrinogen concentrations were altered over time, and correlated with white blood cell counts (Pearson's correlation  = 0.96; 0.001). Hens treated with E had increased (0.01) levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, confirming that E induced hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia.

Intrauterine growth-restricted fetuses (intrauterine growth restriction [IUGR]) have a higher risk of pulmonary arterial hypertension in adulthood. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by hyperproliferation, invasive migration, and disordered angiogenesis, is a hallmark of pulmonary arterial hypertension pathogenesis. Growing evidence suggests that intergenerational transmission of disease, including , can be induced by IUGR. Epigenetic modification of the paternal germline is implicated in this transmission. However, it is unclear whether offspring of individuals born with IUGR are also at risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. Using a model of maternal caloric restriction to induce IUGR, we found that first and second generations of IUGR exhibited elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, myocardial, and vascular remodeling after prolonged exposure to hypoxia. Primary pulmonary vascular endothelial cells (PVECs) from both first and second generations of IUGR exhibited greater proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Moreover, in 2 generations, PVECs-derived ET-1 (endothelin-1) was activated by IUGR and hypoxia, and its knockdown mitigated PVECs dysregulation. Most interestingly, within ET-1 first intron, reduced DNA methylation and enhanced tri-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 were observed in PVECs and sperm of first generation of IUGR, with DNA demethylation in PVECs of second generation of IUGR. These results suggest that IUGR permanently altered epigenetic signatures of ET-1 from the sperm and PVECs in the first generation, which was subsequently transferred to PVECs of offspring. This mechanism would yield 2 generations with endothelial dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension-like pathophysiological features in adulthood.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588816>The association between retinol-binding protein 4 and prediabetes in obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p> Retinol-binding protein 4 RBP4) is associated with visceral fat and insulin resistance (IR) in obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but some of these data remain controversial.

We thus generated fatty acid-binding protein 4 (Fabp4)-GDF5 transgenic (TG) mice and showed that GDF5 TG mice developed a relative lean phenotype on a high-fat diet (HFD) and showed increased insulin sensitivity. Over expression of GDF5 in adipose tissues greatly promoted the thermogenic process in sWAT after cold or β3-agonist treatment. In TG mice, sWAT showed an important thermogenic effect as the thermogenic gene expression was markedly increased, which was consistent with the typical features of beige adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of the protein GDF5 impaired browning program in sWAT after thermogenic stimuli. Enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) signaling was also identified in sWAT of HFD-fed GDF5 mice, and thermogenesis in mature adipocytes induced by GDF5 protein could be partly blocked by a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Taken together, our data suggest that GDF5 could improve insulin sensitivity and prevent , the adaptive thermogenesis in sWAT could mediate the obesity resistance effects of GDF5 in mice and partially resulted in the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636376>The Iberian pig fed with high-fat diet: a model of renal disease in obesity and .</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of renal disease in the context of overweight/obesity, , and insulin resistance is not completely understood. This may be due to the lack of a definitive animal model of disease, which limits our understanding of obesity-induced renal damage. We evaluated the changes in renal histology and lipid deposits induced by obesity in a model of insulin resistance: the Iberian swine fed with fat-enriched food.Twenty-eight female sows were randomized to standard (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD: 6.8% of saturated fat) for 100 days. Weight, adiposity, analytics, oral glucose tolerance tests, and measured renal function were determined. Renal histology and lipid deposits in renal tissue were analyzed.Animals on HFD developed obesity, hypertension, high levels of LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin resistance, and glomerular hyperfiltration. No animal developed overt diabetes. Animals on HFD showed "diabetoid changes", including mesangial expansion [21.40% ± 4 vs.13.20% ± 4.0, p < 0.0001], nodular glomerulosclerosis [7.40% ± 7, 0.75 vs. 2.40% ± 4.7, p = 0.02], and glomerulomegaly (18% vs. 10%, p = 0.010) than those on SD.

The present study examined whether this hypothesis applies to persons with a risk phenotype for the development of cardiovascular/neurodegenerative diseases. A randomized crossover trial was conducted in subjects with  traits ( = 26, 8 female, age 70 ± , BMI 30.3 ± 2.3 kg/m). Each subject participated in four interventions: iso-energetic (4300 kJ) meals (Western diet high-fat, WD, and Mediterranean-type diet, MD) followed by either 30 min of moderate walking (4.6 ± 0.1 km/h) or rest. Attention, mood, satiety and plasma cortisol concentrations were measured at fasting and 1., 3.0, 4. h postprandially. Data were analyzed by linear mixed models. In all interventions, attention increased continuously in the postprandial period (time effect,  < 0.001). After WD, attention was lower after walking compared to resting (meal × activity effect,  < 0.05). Postprandial mood was generally "good" with no intervention effects. Postprandial satiety increased reaching maximum at 1. h after meal (time effect,  < 0.001) and was higher after MD compared to WD (meal effect,  < 0.001). In all interventions, plasma cortisol decreased similar to its diurnal variation (time effect,  < 0.001). In our subjects, meal composition had no relevant impact on attention and mood. After typical WD, resting instead of walking seems to have a more beneficial effect on postprandial attention. MD leads to a strong and long-lasting feeling of satiety, possibly resulting in reduced energy intake in the further course of the day and, thus, long-term effect on weight control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619223>The effect of different grazing conditions on the insulin and incretin response to the oral glucose test in ponies.</a></h2><p>The oral glucose test (OGT) is a useful tool for diagnosing insulin dysregulation (ID) and is somewhat repeatable in ponies under consistent management. This study aimed to determine whether the insulin and incretin responses to an OGT in ponies differed after short-term access to fertilised pasture, compared to unfertilised pasture, by using a randomised, repeated measures study design. Sixteen mixed-breed ponies were classified as severely insulin-dysregulated (SD; post-prandial insulin ≥80 μIU/mL) or not severely insulin-dysregulated (NSD; post-prandial insulin < 80 μIU/mL) using an OGT prior to the study. The ponies accessed pasture that was fertilised, or unfertilised, for  days (4 h/day, with supplemental hay provided at 0.7% bodyweight), with a 10 day period between phases. An OGT was performed after each phase. Glucose, insulin, active glucagon-like peptide-1 (aGLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) were measured in post-prandial blood samples.The volume of fertilised pasture was five-fold greater than unfertilised pasture, with % non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) similar between all forages. Consuming fertilised pasture increased (P = 0.018) the serum insulin response to an OGT, compared to grazing unfertilised pasture. A limitation of the study was that pasture intake was unable to be quantified. Insulin responses were greater in SD, compared to NSD, ponies (P < 0.001) and remained well above the test cut-off at all times. A subset of ponies, initially screened as NSD, became (more) insulin-dysregulated after pasture access. Further, aGLP-1 was a significant predictor of insulin concentration in this cohort.Whereas some insulin-dysregulated ponies were comparatively resistant to dietary intervention, others showed markedly different OGT responses following subtle changes in their forage-based diet. This implies that mild/early ID might be unmasked by dietary change, and that dietary management is important in these ponies. However, dietary management alone may not be adequate for all cases of ID.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568476>Drivers of HIV-1 transmission: The Portuguese case.</a></h2><p>Portugal has one of the most severe HIV-1 epidemics in Western Europe. Two subtypes circulate in parallel since the beginning of the epidemic. Comparing their transmission patterns and its association with transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is important to pinpoint transmission hotspots and to develop evidence-based treatment guidelines.Demographic, clinical and genomic data were collected from 3599 HIV-1 naive patients between 2001 and 2014. Sequences obtained from drug resistance testing were used for subtyping, TDR determination and transmission clusters (TC) analyses.In Portugal, transmission of subtype B was significantly associated with young males, while transmission of subtype G was associated with older heterosexuals. In Portuguese originated people, there was a decreasing trend both for prevalence of subtype G and for number of TCs in this subtype. The active TCs that were identified (i.e. clusters originated after 2008) were associated with subtype B-infected males residing in Lisbon. TDR was significantly different when comparing subtypes B (10.8% [9.-12.2]) and G (7.6% [6.4-9.0]) (p = 0.001).TC analyses shows that, in Portugal, the subtype B epidemic is active and fueled by young male patients residing in Lisbon, while transmission of subtype G is decreasing.

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from  individuals with  who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

Subcutaneous adipose tissue is a rich source of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells, and moreover it plays an important role in the pathophysiology of obesity, , and wound healing. In this retrospective, single-centred appraisal, complications are examined and correlated with individual SVF numbers in abdominal subcutaneous fat tissue. We analysed whether the weight loss method affected complications. Eighty seven massive weight loss patients undergoing body contouring surgery between 2010 and 2017 were included in the study. In total, 57 cases with at least one complication were recorded (65.%). Maximum lifetime weight was 109.6 kg (range 48-184 kg). Half of the complications (50.8%) were minor complications without the need for surgical revision. The mean number of SVF found in the resected tissue was 714 997.63 cells/g fat tissue. We found no statistical difference in complication rates dependent on cell numbers. Smoking (P = .049) and a high BMI at the time point of surgery (P = .031) led to significantly more complications. Also, a high resection weight (P = .057) showed a tendency for impaired wound healing.

Gut microbiome diversity and its natural fermentation products are not only correlated with MS and CAD, but their correlations also appear to be stronger than the associations with traditional risk factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a new potential pathway for the natural fermentation product butyrate to improve MS and to examine whether it is associated with serum  profiles and gut flora composition.  C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with 400 mg/kg of sodium butyrate for 16 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected, and the metabolite concentrations and 16s rRNA were measured with liquid chromatography-MS and Illumina platform, respectively. The plasma differential metabolites and gut microbiome composition were analyzed with XCMS online and QIIME 2, respectively.  Gut microbiome-derived butyrate reduced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, resisting HFD-induced increase in the relative abundance of f_, f_, and f_. Meanwhile, sodium butyrate increased the levels of α-linolenate, all-trans-retinal, resolvin E1, and leukotriene in the plasma, and the differential pathways showed enrichment in mainly resolvin E biosynthesis, histidine degradation, lipoxin biosynthesis, and leukotriene biosynthesis. Moreover, sodium butyrate increased the levels of phosphorylated-adenosine '-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and facilitated glucose transporter member 4 (GLUT4) in the adipose tissue.  Butyrate can induce AMPK activation and GLUT4 expression in the adipose tissue, improving cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related  disorder, resisting HFD-induced gut microbiome dysbiosis, and promoting resolvin E1 and lipoxin biosynthesis.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in the urinary proteome of 18 individuals classified into metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUHO) patients. Proteome analysis was performed using the two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). Upon analysis, a total of 54 proteins were found to be affected with ≥1.-fold change (ANOVA,  ≤ 0.05), of which 44 proteins were upregulated and 10 proteins were downregulated. These differentially abundant proteins were related to nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways and were involved in cellular compromise, inflammatory response, and cancer. Proteins involved in inflammation (fibrinogen alpha (FIBA), serotransferrin (TRFE, and kininogen-1 (KNG1)) and insulin resistance (ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-like protein 15 (ARL15) and retinol-binding protein 4 (RET4)) were found to be significantly increased in the urine samples of MUHO compared to MHO patients. Investigating the effects of obesity on urinary proteins can help in developing efficient diagnostic procedures for early detection and prevention of obesity-related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534145>Temporal changes in transcriptome profile provide insights of White Spot  Virus infection in Litopenaeus vannamei.</a></h2><p>Shrimp aquaculture is severely affected by WSSV. Despite an increasing effort to understand host/virus interaction by characterizing changes in gene expression (GE) following WSSV infection, the majority of published studies have focussed on a single time-point, providing limited insight on the development of host-pathogen interaction over the infection cycle. Using RNA-seq, we contrasted GE in gills of Litopenaeus vannamei at 1., 18 and 56 hours-post-infection (hpi), between WSSV-challenged and control shrimps. Time course analysis revealed 5097 differentially expressed genes: 63 DEGs were viral genes and their expression in WSSV group either peaked at 18 hpi (and decreased at 56 hpi) or increased linearly up to 56 hpi, suggesting a different role played by these genes during the course of infection. The remaining DEGs showed that WSSV altered the expression of , immune, apoptotic and cytoskeletal genes and was able to inhibit NF-κB and JAK/STAT pathways. Interestingly, GE changes were not consistent through the course of infection but were dynamic with time, suggesting the complexity of host-pathogen interaction. These data offer novel insights into the cellular functions that are affected during the course of infection and ultimately provide a valuable resource towards our understanding of the host-pathogen dynamics and its variation with time.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624311>Morning blood pressure surge is associated with autonomic neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease in patients with diabetes.</a></h2><p>Although vascular and autonomic nervous system have been involved in the regulation of morning surge in blood pressure (MBPS), data on clinical correlates of MBPS in diabetic population are scarce, in particular with regard to diabetic complications. This study was aimed at investigating predictors and correlates of MBPS in diabetes. In a cross-sectional study including 167 patients with diabetes (age 58. ± 11.1 years, duration 15.9 ± 12.1 years), clinical variables, diabetic and neuropathic complications, and MBPS (using 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) were measured. The upper quartile of MBPS (>30. mmHg) was associated with higher values of waist circumference (P = 0.027), triglycerides (P = 0.021), and Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score (P = 0.042), with lower HDL cholesterol (P = 0.030), and with the presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) (P = 0.016) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (P < 0.0001). In a logistic regression analysis, PVD (odds ratio: 10.2, P = 0.001), CAN (odds ratio: 6.09, P = 0.016), and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (odds ratio: 1.06, P = 0.022) predicted MBPS upper quartile (r = 0.20, P = 0.0005). In a multiple regression analysis, PVD (P = 0.002) and diastolic BP (P = 0.003) were the only determinants of MBPS (r = 0.20). MBPS upper quartile was associated with BP dipping (systolic BP day-night reduction > 10%) (P = 0.012), and MBPS was positively related to systolic (rho = 0.41, P < 0.0001) and diastolic BP day-night reduction. In conclusion,  stigmata, diastolic BP, CAN and PVD are the main predictors of MBPS in the diabetic population. Excessive MBPS and nondipping are not concurrent 24-h BP alterations.

The aim of the present study was to assess the potential of using glutamate level to identify individuals with abdominal obesity and a high cardiometabolic risk.The study sample included 99 men and 99 women. Fasting serum glutamate was measured using the Biocrates p180 kit. Anthropometric and  variables were used to identify individuals with abdominal obesity (WC ≥ 95 cm in both sexes), the hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTW) phenotype and the  (MetS). Mean (±SD) age was 34.1 ± 10.1 years, mean BMI was 29.0 ± 6.2 kg/m and mean WC was 92.7 ± 16. cm. Glutamate was strongly correlated with WC (r = 0.66 for men; r = 0.76 for women, both p < 0.0001) and multiple markers of  dysfunction, particularly fasting triglyceride level (r = 0.59 for men; r = 0.57 for women, both p < 0.0001), HDL-cholesterol level (r = -0.45, p < 0.0001 in both sexes) and the HOMA-IR index (r = 0.65 for men; r = 0.60 for women, both p < 0.0001). Logistic regressions showed that glutamate had an excellent accuracy to identify individuals with abdominal obesity (ROC_AUC: 0.90 for both sexes), a good accuracy to identify those with the HTW phenotype (ROC_AUC: 0.82 for men; 0.85 for women) and fair-to-good accuracy for the MetS (ROC_AUC: 0.78 for men; 0.89 for women).Glutamate level may represent an interesting potential biomarker of abdominal obesity and  risk.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

The early identification of high-risk individuals is the key for halting these conditions. The world is facing a growing epidemic MetS although the magnitude in Egypt is unknown.  To describe MetS and its determinants among apparently healthy individuals residing in urban and rural communities in Egypt and to establish a model for MetS prediction.  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt. Participants were clinically evaluated and interviewed for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary habits. MetS was defined according to the harmonized criteria set by the AHA/NHLBI. The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and fatty liver were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and fatty liver. Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were obesity [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid obesity [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (2.23-8.61)]. Consumption of caffeine once per week protected against MetS by 27.8-fold. The derived prediction rule was accurate in predicting MetS, fatty liver, high risk of DM, and, to a lesser extent, a 10-year lifetime risk of IHD.  Central obesity and sedentary lifestyles are accountable for the rising rates of MetS in our society. Interventions are needed to minimize the potential predisposition of the Egyptian population to cardiometabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564389>Vitamin C suppresses ovarian pathophysiology in experimental polycystic ovarian .</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary  (PCOS), also known as the Stein-Leventhal  is one of the most common causes of anovulation, infertility and hyperandrogenism in women, affecting between -10 % of women of reproductive age (12-35 years) worldwide. Despite substantial effort to define the cause of PCOS, its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Consequently, determining the mechanisms of PCOS and the possible treatment is the major goal of medical research in endocrine and reproductive physiology.To investigate the mechanism of ovarian  changes in dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced polycystic ovary in Wistar rats treated with vitamin C.Twenty-eight immature female Wistar rats weighing (16-21 g) were randomly divided into four groups (n = 7/group): group I served as control and was given water, group II were injected with DHEA (6 mg/100 g in 0.2 ml corn oil subcutaneously to induce PCOS condition), group III received 150 mg/kg BW of Vitamin C orally, group IV were co-administered with 6 mg/kg BW DHEA in 0.2 ml of corn oil subcutaneously and 150 mg/kg BW of Vitamin C orally. All treatments lasted for 15 days. Twenty-four hours after the last administration, the rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Blood samples and ovaries were collected for reproductive hormonal analysis, biochemical and histopathological analysis. The expressions of mRNA androgen receptor gene in the ovary were determined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. All data were analysed using one-way ANOVA.There was a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the antioxidant and  enzyme activity in the DHEA treated group compared with the control group. DHEA co-administration with Vitamin C showed a significant decrease in Malondialdehyde, cytokines and Estrogen and a significant increase (p < 0.05) in antioxidant and  enzymes compared with DHEA treated group only. The histopathological evaluation demonstrates a reduction in cystic and atretic ovaries, increased expression of Bcl and E-Cadherin with a reduction in Bax expression in the group co-administered with DHEA and Vitamin C. The DHEA group showed overexpression of mRNA Androgen Receptor gene in the ovaries compared to the control group.This study shows that Vitamin C plays a protective role against DHEA-Induced Polycystic Ovary in Wistar rats via its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia are hallmarks of  (MetS). However, the role of SCG3 in MetS remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between serum SCG3 levels and  parameters in subjects with and without MetS. This was a case control study, and 295 subjects were recruited. Serum SCG3 concentrations were compared between groups. Associations between SCG3 levels and clinico- parameters were also examined. We found serum SCG3 levels were higher in the MetS group than non-MetS group (122.6 ± 79.2 vs. 90.6 ± 58. nmol/L,  = 0.009). Specifically, elevated SCG3 levels were found in subjects with high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, central obesity, or hypertriglyceridemia. Additionally, MetS was an independent factor of serum SCG3 levels in multivariate linear regression analyses. Moreover, FPG, free fatty acids, and waist circumference were positively associated with serum SCG3 concentrations after adjusting for insulin levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and cardiovascular risk factors.

In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of ED and evaluate the associated risk factors in a cohort of 254 young (18-49 years) nondiabetic obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg m) men from primary care. Erectile function (International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF-] questionnaire), quality of life (Aging Males' Symptoms [AMS scale]), and body composition analysis (Tanita MC-180MA) were determined. Total testosterone was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to study the factors associated with ED. ED prevalence was 42.1%. Subjects with ED presented higher BMI, waist circumference, number of components of the , AMS score, insulin resistance, and a more unfavorable body composition than those without ED. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a pathological AMS score (odds ratio [OR]: 4.238, P < 0.001), degree of obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg m, OR: 2.602, P = 0.005, compared with BMI 30-34.9 kg m), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels (OR: 0.956, P = 0.004), and age (OR: 1.047, P = 0.016) were factors independently associated with ED. In conclusion, we demonstrate that, in a primary care-based cohort of nondiabetic young obese men, ED affected >40% of subjects. A pathological AMS score, the degree of obesity, and age were positively associated with ED, while elevated HDL-cholesterol levels were inversely associated with the odds of presenting ED.

Plasma atherogenic index (PAI) is the logarithmic ratio of serum TG level to HDL-C and related to cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine the accuracy of PAI in determining renal malignancy in localized renal masses preoperatively.Totally 169 patients who were diagnosed with Bosniak III-IV lesions by imaging modalities and treated in our hospital with partial or radical nephrectomy were retrospectively analyzed using institutional renal cancer database between 2013 and 2018. Preoperative images were evaluated by two experienced radiologists. The patients were divided into two groups according to their postoperative pathological diagnosis as malignant or benign tumors. The PAI of each patient was calculated and the statistical significance of PAI in predicting malignancy for renal masses was analyzed using uni- and multivariable analyses.Of patients, 109 (64.%) were males and 60 (35.%) were females with a median age of 61 (33-84) years. Median tumor size was 6. (2-18) cm. Pathological diagnosis was malignant in 145 (85.8%) and benign in 24 (14.2%) patients. There was no statistically significant difference in serum TG levels between malignant and benign cases (p > 0.05). The HDL-C levels were significantly lower in malignant cases (p = 0.001). Median PAI value was 0.63 (0.34-1.58) and significantly higher in malignant cases (p = 0.003). The PAI cut-off value for malignancy was ≥0.34. The sensitivity was calculated as 88.2% and specificity as 45.8%, the positive predictive value as 90.8, negative predictive value as 39.3, and odds ratio as 6.37 (95% CI: 2.466-16.458). In multivariable analysis, gender, smoking status, and hypertension had no effect on malignancy, whereas PAI and HDL-C were independent risk factors (p = 0.003 and p = 0.003, respectively). The risk of malignancy was .019 times higher, when PAI was > 0.34 (95% CI: 1.744-14.445) in multivariable logistic regression analysis.The PAI can be used as a predictive tool in suspicion of malignant renal masses.

In contrast to breastfed infants, excessive protein in IMF is associated with overweight and symptoms of  in formula-fed infants. Moreover, the beta-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) content in cow milk is 3-4 g/L, whereas it is not present in human milk. It is considered to be a major reason for cow milk allergy in infants. In this respect, to modify protein composition, increasing the ratio of alpha-lactalbumin (α-Lac) to β-Lg would be a pragmatic approach to develop a hypoallergenic IMF with low protein content. Such a formula would ensure the necessary balance of essential amino acids, as 123 and 162 amino acid residues are available in α-Lac and β-Lg, respectively. Hence, in this study, a pasteurized form of hypoallergenic and low-protein ready-to-feed (RTF) formula, a new product, is developed to retain heat-sensitive bioactives and other components. Therefore, the effects of high pressure processing (HPP) under 300-600 MPa at approximately 20-40 °C and HTST pasteurization (72 °C for 15 and 30 s) were investigated and compared. The highest ratio of α-Lac to β-Lg was achieved after HPP (600 MPa for  min applied at 40.4 °C), which potentially explains the synergistic effect of HPP and heat on substantial denaturation of β-Lg, with significant retention of α-Lac in reconstituted IMF. : This investigation showed the potential production of a pasteurized RTF formula, a niche product, with a reduced amount of allergenic β-Lg.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496914>CD4/CD8 Ratio as a Predictor for the Occurrence of  in HIV / AIDS Patients During 6 Months of cART Therapy.</a></h2><p>HIV infection is characterized by progressive depletion of CD4 T cells due to their reduced synthesis and increased destruction followed by marked activation and expansion of CD8 T lymphocytes. CD4/CD8 ratio was traditionally described as a marker of immune system ageing in the general population, but it increasingly appears as a marker of different outcomes in the HIV-infected population. The main objective of this study is to examine the power of CD4/CD8 ratio in predicting the occurrence of  (MetS) in HIV-positive patients receiving cART therapy.80 HIV/AIDS subjects were included in a retrospective case-control study. Flow cytometry was used to determine the percentage of CD4 and CD8 cells in peripheral blood of these patients.

The drug scheme administration consisted of a starting dose of STP of 10-15 mg/kg/d with increments every week, up to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/d, based on both age and weight. Etiology of epilepsy was codified as structural, genetic, infectious, immune, , and unknown. Responders were defined as patients who achieved a seizure frequency reduction of ≥50%. Retention rate was defined as the probability of continuing STP without additional therapy. Tolerability was assessed by reporting adverse events.A total of 132 individuals aged from  months to 43 years received add-on STP, including 30 patients with Dravet  (DS). The median follow-up was 14.8 months (range = 4 months-18 years, interquartile range = 25.72). Twenty-nine individuals (22%) received more than two antiepileptic drugs. Benzodiazepines, mainly clobazam, were the most commonly used add-on drugs. Sixty-six patients (50%) were responders, and 13 of them (9.8%) were seizure-free. Responder rate was higher in the genetic etiology group (57%), especially in DS (18/30; 60%), and in patients with refractory focal onset epilepsy without bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (/15; 33%). The median relapse-free survival was 27 months in the 66 responders. The median time to STP failure was 24.6 months in all 132 individuals.This study confirms the long-term efficacy of add-on STP treatment in patients with different types of refractory epilepsies, including focal onset epilepsy without bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Further confirmations based on prospectively designed studies are required to confirm STP efficacy in focal epilepsy.Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2019 International League Against Epilepsy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521563>Sleeve gastrectomy in patients with previous antireflux surgery. Preliminary results of the "no-touch to posterior wrap" technique.</a></h2><p>Reported morbidity of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in patients with previous antireflux surgery warrants caution, and data on sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are unexpectedly scarce.To evaluate the safety and efficiency of SG in patients who previously underwent an antireflux procedure. A new technique to preserve intact fundoplication is described.Private practice, bariatric center of excellence, Turkey.The following data were retrieved from our prospective data base: (1) details of previous repair; (2) clinical/endoscopic reflux status, body mass index (kg/m), and presence of  (MetS) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) before SG; (3) duration of SG, length of stay, complications; and (4) percent excess weight loss, MetS/T2D resolution, and reflux status at follow-up.Fifteen consecutive SGs were performed without conversion or major complications. The first case is excluded from the analysis because complete wrap unfolding was abandoned in favor of the described technique. Among 14, 10 had MetS, 4 had T2D, and 1 had a proven reflux recurrence before SG. Mean operating time was 118. minutes. All were discharged on the third postoperative day. Apart from 1 functional stenosis, no complications occurred. At 12 months, percent excess weight loss rate was 82.2, MetS resolved in 9 of 10, and T2D was in complete (n = 2) or partial remission (n = 1). No de novo reflux became evident, and absence of reflux was proved by pHmeter in 3.SG is feasible in patients who previously had antireflux repair with negligible morbidity and percent excess weight loss rates similar to that with regular sleeves.

Here, we examined the  and behavioral alterations associated with a high-fat diet (HFD) in male and female  knock-in mice. Male and female mice were fed a 45% kcal HFD or a 10% kcal low-fat diet (LFD) for 12 weeks and adipose tissue accumulation, glucose levels, anxiety-like behavior, and spatial memory were examined. We found that with HFD, male  mice were more susceptible to  disturbances, including visceral adipose tissue (VAT) accumulation and glucose intolerance when compared to  mice, while female  and  mice had similar  responses. Behaviorally, there were no effects of HFD in mice of either genotype.

Increased levels of specific liver enzymes in the peripheral blood are typical findings in horses diagnosed with EMS. Current management of EMS is based on caloric restriction and increased physical activity. However, new potential treatment options are arising such as the transplantation of autologous adipose stem cells (ASC). However, cytophysiological properties of ASC derived from EMS horses are impaired which strongly limits their therapeutic potential. We hypothesized, that in vitro pharmacotherapy of those cells with -azacytidine (AZA) and resveratrol (RES) before their clinical application can reverse the aged phenotype of those cells and improve clinical outcome of autologous therapy. A 9 year old Dutch Warmblood Horse used for driving, was presented with severe obesity, insulin resistance. After EMS diagnosis, the animal received three intravenous injections of autologous, AZA/RES treated ASCs at weekly intervals. The therapeutic effect was assessed by the analysis of liver specific enzymes in the blood. ASC-transplantation reduced levels of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate transaminase (AST).

However, the association between VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) with premature atherosclerosis and (i.e. arterial) inflammation is not completely understood. To provide more insight into this association, we investigated the association between arterial F-fluordeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) uptake, as a measure of arterial inflammation, and  (MetS) markers in early T2DM patients.Forty-four patients with early T2DM, without glucose lowering medication, were studied (median age 63 [IQR 54-66] years, median BMI 30.4 [IQR 27.-35.8]). Arterial inflammation was quantified using glucose corrected maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) FDG of the aorta, carotid, iliac, and femoral arteries, and corrected for background activity (blood pool) as target-to-background ratio (TBR). VAT and SAT volumes (cm) were automatically segmented using computed tomography (CT) between levels L1-L5. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was assessed by liver function test and CT.VAT volume, but not SAT volume, correlated with TBR (r = 0.325, p = 0.031). Linear regression models showed a significant association, even after sequential adjustment for potentially influencing MetS components. Interaction term VAT volume * sex and additional components including HbA1c, insulin resistance, NAFLD, adiponectin, leptin, and C- reactive protein (CRP) did not change the independent association between VAT volume and TBR.CT-assessed VAT volume is positively associated with FDG-PET assessed arterial inflammation, independently of factors thought to potentially mediate these effects. These findings suggest that VAT in contrast to SAT is linked to early atherosclerotic changes in T2DM patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this follow-up study, we assess short-term and long-term effects of these therapies on the gut microbiota, antibiotic resistance, and  parameters.This was a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial done at nine medical centres in Taiwan. Adult patients (>20 years) with documented H pylori infection were randomly assigned (1:1:1, with block sizes of six) to receive T14, C10, or BQ10. We assessed long-term outcomes (reinfection frequency, changes in the gut microbiota, antibiotic resistance, and  parameters) in patients with available data, excluding all protocol violators and those with unknown post-treatment H pylori status. Faecal samples were collected before treatment and 2 weeks, 2 months, and at least 1 year after eradication therapy. Amplification of the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA was done followed by high-throughput sequencing. Susceptibility testing for faecal Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was done. This trial is complete and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, .Between July 17, 2013, and April 20, 2016, 1620 participants were randomly assigned to the three treatment groups (540 [33%] per group). 1214 (75%) attended 1-year follow-up and are included in this analysis.

Beta diversity was also significantly altered 2 weeks after T14 (p=0·0010), C10 (p=0·0001), and BQ10 (p=0·0001). Alpha diversity and beta diversity were restored at week 8 (p=0·14 and p=0·918, respectively) and 1 year (p=0·14 and p=0·918) after T14, but were not fully recovered at week 8 and after 1 year in patients treated with C10 (p=0·0001 and p=0·013 at week 8; p=0·019 and p=0·064 at 1 year) and BQ10 (p<0·0001 and p=0·0002; p=0·001 and p=0·029).

Although bodyweight and body-mass index slightly increased, there were significant improvements in  parameters, with a decrease in insulin resistance, triglycerides, and LDL and an increase in HDL. Overall, there was no significant change in the prevalence of  at week 8 and 1 year after T14, C10, and BQ10.Eradication of H pylori infection has minimal disruption of the microbiota, no effect on antibiotic resistance of E coli, and some positive effects on  parameters.

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea  (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut microbiota contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to  disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or  kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related  disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498243>Metabolically Healthy Obesity and the Risk of Erosive Esophagitis: A Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>Obesity is an established risk factor of erosive esophagitis, and  unhealthiness has been implicated in the pathogenesis of erosive esophagitis. Yet, the risk of erosive esophagitis among obese individuals without obesity-related  unhealthiness, a condition referred to as "metabolically healthy obese (MHO)", remains unclear. We examined the association between body mass index (BMI) categories and the development of erosive esophagitis in a cohort of metabolically healthy individuals.We conducted a cohort study of 14,725 asymptomatic adults free of erosive esophagitis and  abnormalities, who underwent repeated health checkups including screening endoscopy. A metabolically healthy state was defined as having no  components and a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance <2.. The presence of erosive esophagitis was determined using endoscopy.During 81,385.2 person-years of follow-up, 1,865 participants developed erosive esophagitis (incidence rate, 22.9 per 1,000 person-years). The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident erosive esophagitis comparing overweight (BMI 23.0-24.9) and obese (≥25) with normal-weight participants (18.-22.9) were 1.12 (1.00-1.25) and 1.29 (1.14-1.47), respectively.

Group III received 7. mg/kg of aspirin orally; Group IV received 6 mg/100kg of body weight of DHEA in 0.2ml of oil subcutaneously and 7. mg/kg of aspirin orally. After 15 days of administration, the rats were slaughtered by cervical dislocation. Blood samples and ovaries were collected for reproductive hormonal analysis, biochemical and histopathological analysis. The expressions of mRNA androgen receptor (AR) gene in the ovary were determined by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). All the data was analyzed using one way ANOVA with the Graph pad prism software version 6. A p<0.05 was considered significant.The results obtained showed that dehydroepiandrosterone treatment caused significant decrease (p<0.05) in total protein, superoxide Dismutase (SOD), glutathione-s- transferase (GST), Ca ATPase, and significant increase (p<0.05) in malondialdehyde, vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor and estrogen as compared to Controls.

For a cutoff value of 88.75 ng/ml for IRT-2, sensitivity was determined as 90%, specificity as 65% and PPV as 15.2%.This is the first detailed clinical study that has evaluated the data from the CFNS program in the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. As false positive results are extremely high in Turkey, there is an urgent need for revision of IRT-1 and IRT-2 limits by evaluating the data of the whole country.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616170>Skeletal muscle mass to visceral fat area ratio is an important determinant associated with type 2 diabetes and .</a></h2><p>Skeletal muscle mass to visceral fat area ratio (SVR) were shown to be related to some chronic diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. The aim of this study is to determine whether the SVR is associated with  (MS) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM).A total of 798 subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. Lipid profiles, plasma glucose, blood pressure, waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) were grouped by the SVR. The associations between the SVR and T2DM and MS were examined using logistic regression to determine whether the SVR was associated with T2DM and MS.Lipid profiles, glucose levels, blood pressure, WC and BMI showed significant differences when stratified based on the extent of SVR. The SVR levels were also significantly higher in subjects without MS or T2DM than in those with MS or T2DM. The SVR was inversely correlated with lipid profiles and WC and was especially correlated with BMI, with an r>0.. The SVR was identified as a risk factor for T2DM and MS after adjusting age and sex. SVR can predict T2DM [area under the curve =0.726, 95% CI (0.669-0.782), <0.001] and MS [area under the curve =0.730, 95% CI (0.694-0.766), <0.001]. The suitable cut-off value is 0.230 for T2DM (sensitivity 0.696, specificity 0.694) and 0.278 for the onset of MS (sensitivity 0.518, specificity 0.862).The SVR is closely associated with an increased risk for exacerbating T2DM and MS and can be used as a diagnostic indicator for T2DM and MS.© 2019 Wang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639178>Sleep problems are a strong predictor of stress-related  changes in police officers. A prospective study.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that workers chronically exposed to occupational stress have an increased risk of  (MetS) and sleep problems (SPs). The purpose of this study was to verify whether SPs mediate the relationship between stress and MetS.A -year prospective cohort study included 242 police officers from a rapid response unit engaged exclusively in maintaining law and order. Perceived stress levels were measured repeatedly with the demand-control-support and the effort-reward-imbalance questionnaires; insomnia symptoms were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; excessive daytime sleepiness was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. MetS and its components were evaluated at baseline and at follow-up.During -year follow-up period, 26 new cases of MetS were identified. Both occupational stress and SPs were significantly related to incident cases of MetS. Insomnia symptoms showed a highly significant association with MetS (aOR 11.038; CI95% 2.867-42.493). Mediation analysis confirmed that SPs mediate the relationship between stress and MetS. A reciprocal relationship was found between job stress and SPs. Work-related stress was a significant predictor of insomnia symptoms, short sleep duration, sleep dissatisfaction, and sleepiness. Compared to the reference group, police officers with SPs at baseline had significantly higher odds of reporting high stress at follow-up.SPs play a mediating role in the relationship between occupational stress and MetS. Prevention of MetS must include the control of stress factors and an increase in the resilience of workers, but correct sleep hygiene is also an essential factor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664519>Dietary intervention using (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a fungus-derived soluble prebiotic ameliorates high-fat diet-induced  distress and alters beneficially the gut microbiota in mice model.</a></h2><p>Western diet, rich in carbohydrates and fat, is said to be a major factor underlying . Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut microbiota, have paramount impact on host-associated  disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced  distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or  g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal microbiota analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced  distress.

To our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic.This was a cross-sectional study, and blood tests performed were double-blind. Within 3 months, 205 PCOS patients, from whom 55 also had MS, and 65 healthy women (control) were recruited. Malondialdehyde (MDA) was assessed as an important oxidative indicator, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant activity (TAA), vitamin C (VC), vitamin E (VE) and retinol (RET) as antioxidative indicators. Their correlation with features of MS was analyzed including their dependency on lipid pattern.SOD, TAA, VE and RET in the PCOS group and PCOS + MS group were lower and MDA higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). SOD, VE and RET were the lowest in PCOS + MS group (p < 0.05). Thus, patients in this group had the highest oxidative stress levels but the lowest antioxidative capacity. SOD and TAA significantly decreased with increase of triglycerides (TG) and LDL-C in the PCOS + MS group (p < 0.05), but without dependency on HDL-C. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the different expression of oxidative stress in the three groups and decrease of SOD from control to PCOS group to PCOS + MS group, being associated with an increase of TG.MS can accelerate the oxidative stress process in patients with PCOS and decrease the antioxidative capacity. The decreased antioxidant capacity in PCOS with MS is related to increased TG and LDL-C.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506278>Genetic and Environmental Influences on the Correlations between Traits of  and Chronic Kidney Disease.</a></h2><p> is a cluster of risk factors associated with CKD.

It is characterized by accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes associated with lobular inflammation and balonization, which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Thus, a characterization and follow-up of a progression of the fibrosis level of these patients becomes important, being that the transient hepatic elastography is a reliable method for this evaluation with a measure of the kapa index.To evaluate the progression of hepatic fibrosis through elastography in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Patients who had previously performed hepatic biopsy and noninvasive scores for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis were included in the study. These same subjects were then submitted to current clinical evaluation, laboratory and liver elastography tests, defining the level of liver fibrosis, about 10 years after the first evaluation.Data were analyzed for 66 patients previously submitted to liver biopsy. Of these, 16 were not found, four could not participate because they were debilitated due to hepatic cirrhosis, two had died from an automobile accident and five from complications of cirrhosis of the liver. Therefore, of the 50 patients with a known history, 9 (18%) had died of cirrhosis or were unable to attend the examination because of their liver disease. The remaining population was predominantly female (61.%), mean age of 63 years, being overweight, dyslipidemia (76.9%), disorders of the glycemic profile (76.9%), and  (82.1%). Of the 39 cases evaluated, 35% had the same degree of fibrosis at the initial evaluation (biopsy) and at the current evaluation (elastography), 33% had an increase in the degree of fibrosis and another 30% had a decrease in the degree of fibrosis. Twenty-eight patients had NASH at baseline. Regarding these patients, it was observed in the current evaluation, that 25% remained stable in the degree of fibrosis, 39% progressed, and 35% regressed.Despite some limitations of our study, such as the small number of patients, and the use of two different methods of evaluation (biopsy and elastography), the data obtained allow us to conclude that of the 39 evaluated cases, 33% (13) presented progression of fibrosis and the total group of 50 patients, 42% had cirrhosis or died due to liver disease. The presence of NASH on hepatic biopsy did not prove to be, in our study, a predictive of the evolution of hepatic fibrosis in the patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515789>[Clinical and genetic diagnosis of a pedigree affected with autosomal recessive Alport ].</a></h2><p>To explore the genetic basis of a child with chronic kidney disease featuring renal shrinkage and creatinine increase.Peripheral venous blood samples were taken from the child, his brother and two parents and subjected to whole exome sequencing.

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), now considered as a metabolically active organ, is also linked to these factors.To analyse the association between EAT volume measured using computed tomography and LV remodelling in a prospective cohort of patients with aortic stenosis.Consecutive asymptomatic patients with at least mild degenerative aortic stenosis enrolled in a prospective cohort that aimed to assess the determinants of aortic stenosis occurrence and progression constituted our population.We enrolled 143 patients (78± years; 65% men). Mean LV mass and EAT volume were 219±64g and 134±56mL, respectively. LV hypertrophy was diagnosed in 86 patients (60%), and concentric hypertrophy (32%) was the main remodelling pattern. EAT was associated with body mass index (P<0.001) and body surface area (P<0.001), but not with age (P=0.33) or aortic stenosis severity (all P>0.10). EAT was correlated with LV mass (r=0.41; P<0.0001), and after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index/body surface area, hypertension, waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and aortic stenosis severity, EAT was independently associated with LV mass (P=0.01/P=0.02). Similar results were found when EAT and LV mass index (adjusted for body surface area) were considered instead of absolute values (P=0.04).In this prospective cohort of patients with aortic stenosis, EAT volume was independently associated with LV mass.

Research in females has identified specific EA cut-points indicative of risk level for developing physiological and performance disturbances. Cut-points in males have yet to be evaluated. This study examined the prevalence of low EA in competitive (non-elite), recreationally trained (CRT) male endurance athletes. : Subjects were 108 CRT (38.6 ± 13.8 y; 12.2 ± .4 h/wk training) male endurance athletes (runners, cyclists, triathletes) who completed a descriptive survey online via Qualtrics and returned 3 day diet and exercise training records. EA was calculated from returned surveys and training records. Resting  rate (RMR) and lean body mass (LBM) were estimated from self-reported survey data. Prevalence of risk group was categorized based on the female cut-points: at risk (AR) ≤30 kcal/kg LBM, moderate risk (MR) = 30-45 kcal/kg LBM, or no risk (NR) ≥45 kcal/kg LBM. : In this sample, 47.2% ( = 51) were classified as AR, 33.3% ( = 36) as MR, and 19.4% ( = 21) as NR for low EA. Cyclists had lower EA (26.9 ± 17.4 kcal/kg LBM,  = 45) than runners (34.6 ± 13.3 kcal/kg LBM,  = 55,  = 0.016) and all other sport categories (39. ± 19.1 kcal/kg LBM,  = 8,  = 0.037). : The findings indicate this sample had a high prevalence of risk for low EA, at 47.2%. Only 19.4% of participants were at no risk, meaning ~80% of participants were at some degree of risk of experiencing low EA. Cyclists were at greater risk in this cohort of low EA, although why this occurred was unclear and is in need of further investigation.

Diagnosis can be difficult and, in the clinical situation, usually relies upon reported weight loss. The 'omics' technologies allow us the opportunity to study the end points of many biological processes. Among these, blood-based metabolomics is a promising method to investigate the pathophysiology of human cancer cachexia and identify candidate biomarkers. In this study, we performed liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based metabolomics to investigate the  profile of cancer-associated weight loss. Non-selected patients undergoing surgery with curative intent for upper gastrointestinal cancer were recruited. Fasting plasma samples were taken at induction of anaesthesia. LC/MS analysis showed that 6 metabolites were highly discriminative of weight loss. Specifically, a combination profile of LysoPC 18.2, L-Proline, Hexadecanoic acid, Octadecanoic acid, Phenylalanine and LysoPC 16:1 showed close correlation for eight weight-losing samples (≥% weight loss) and nine weight-stable samples (<%weight loss) between predicted and actual weight change (r = 0.976,  = 0.0014). Overall, 40 metabolites were associated with ≥% weight loss.

Using the 2015 and 2016  and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program database, data were obtained for patients with MetS undergoing LSG or LRYGB. There were 29,588 MetS patients (LSG: 58.7%  LRYGB: 41.3%). There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality (0.1% for LSG  0.2% for LRYGB, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.58, confidence interval (CI) 0.32-1.05,  = 0.07) or length of stay between groups (2 ± 2 for LSG  2.2 ± 2 days for LRYGB,  = 0.40). Compared with LRYGB, LSG was associated with significantly shorter operative time (78 ± 39  122 ± 54 minutes,  < 0.01), lower overall morbidity (2.3%  4.4%, AOR 0.53, CI 0.46-0.60,  < 0.01), lower serious morbidity (1.%  2.3%, AOR 0.64, CI 0.53-0.76,  < 0.01), lower 30-day reoperation (1.2%  2.3%, AOR 0.52, CI 0.43-0.63,  < 0.01), and lower 30-day readmission (4.2%  6.6%, AOR 0.62, CI 0.55-0.69,  < 0.01).

Due to the increasing prevalence of , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has evolved into a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma development. Herein, we investigated whether a dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation improves the outcome of progressive NAFLD.Feeding three high-fat diets, differing in n-3 and n-6 PUFA contents and ratios (n-3/n-6: 1:8, 1:1, :1), the impact of n-3 PUFAs and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios on NAFLD-related liver fibrosis and tumorigenesis was analyzed in 12- and 20-week-old streptozotocin/high-fat diet (STZ/HFD)-treated mice.Feeding of n-3 PUFA-rich diets (1:1 and :1) resulted in increased hepatic n-3 PUFA content and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio with decreased hepatic lipid accumulation. In 20-week-old mice, n-3 PUFA-rich diets alleviated tumor load significantly, with reduced liver/body weight index, tumor size, and tumor number. Finally, these effects were accompanied by a significant improvement of survival of these mice.Herein, we showed that increased n-3 PUFA content and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios lead to improved survival and attenuated tumor progression in STZ/HFD-treated mice.

For this population-based cohort study, 2159 adolescents aged 11-18 years were included. Subjects were divided into four obesity phenotype groups: Metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically healthy obese (MHO), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW), and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO). Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to estimate incidence of MetS in adults after a median follow-up of 11.3 years. The incidence rate of MetS in early adulthood was 111.6 per 10000 person-year (95% CI: 98.7-126.3), with higher values in boys [210.1 (95% CI: 183.0-241.3)], compared to girls [39.7 (95% CI: 30.2-52.1)]. In the age- and adult BMI-adjusted model, the HR of MetS in adulthood for boys was 3.33 (95% CI: 2.08-.32) among MUO phenotype followed less than 6 years, 1.71 (95% CI: 1.01-2.90) among MHO, and 2.52 (95% CI: 1.72-3.68) among MUNW. All associations were attenuated in girls except for MUO phenotype followed less than 6 years [.72 (95% CI: 2.14-15.3)]. In conclusion, MUNW and MHO phenotypes in boys, but not in girls and MUO phenotype in both sexes with less than 6 years of follow up increased risk of adult MetS compared to MHNW. It seems that lack of obesity at least in boys does not protect them from development of MetS in adulthood.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615320>Uric acid to HDL cholesterol ratio is a strong predictor of diabetic control in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p> Despite it has some disadvantages, the most important marker of diabetic control is glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).

LQT3 patients display variable responses to Na channel blockers demanding for the development of variant-specific therapeutic strategies. Here we performed a combined electrophysiological analysis with in silico simulation of variant channel to elucidate mechanisms of therapeutic responsiveness. We identified a novel SCN5A variant (A1656D) in a LQTS patient with a distinct response to mexiletine resulting in suppression of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and manifestation of premature atrial contraction. Patch clamp analysis revealed that A1656D variant exerted gain-of-function effects including hyperpolarizing shift of the voltage-dependence of activation, depolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of inactivation, and slowing of fast inactivation. Among ranolazine, flecainide, and mexiletine, only mexiletine restored inactivation kinetics of A1656D currents. In silico simulation to assess the effect of A1656D variant on ventricular cardiac cell excitation predicted a prolonged action potential which is consistent with the prolonged QT and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia of the patient. It also predicted that only mexiletine suppressed the prolonged action potential of human ventricular myocytes expressing A1656D. These data elucidate the underlying mechanism of the distinct response to mexiletine in this patient.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521808>The many faces of early repolarization : A single-center case series.</a></h2><p>Early repolarization  (ERS) is a rare but increasingly recognized cause of malignant ventricular arrhythmias.The purpose of this study was to characterize the presentations and treatments of ERS at our institution.We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients presenting to our institution between 2008 and 2019 with ERS. Exclusion criteria included Brugada , positive provocative testing with class I antiarrhythmic drugs,  disturbances, or structural heart disease.Of 10 patients identified with ERS, 8 were men with a mean age of 30 ± 17 years at diagnosis. Documented arrhythmias included ventricular fibrillation in 7 of 10, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in 3 of 10, and monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in 3 of 10 patients. Atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in 3 of 10, and atrioventricular block was seen in 2 of 10. J waves and/or electrocardiographic early repolarization patterns were dynamic in 7 of 10. Arrhythmias occurred at rest in 8 of 10 and with exertion in 2 of 10. Only 1 patient had a family history of sudden death, and 4 of 10 patients had variants of uncertain significance on genetic testing. Quinidine effectively suppressed arrhythmias in  of  patients but required dose escalation to >1 g/d in 3 of  patients. Abnormal epicardial electrograms were recorded over the inferolateral left ventricle in 2 patients who underwent mapping and were successfully ablated. Premature ventricular contraction triggers were also targeted for ablation in 3 patients.ERS is a heterogeneous condition and may be associated with both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular block, dynamic electrocardiographic changes, and variable triggers. In addition to targeting premature ventricular contraction triggers, mapping and ablation of abnormal epicardial electrograms may be a potential future treatment strategy.Copyright © 2019 Heart Rhythm Society.
