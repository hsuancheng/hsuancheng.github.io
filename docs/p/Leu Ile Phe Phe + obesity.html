<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21974986>Design and development of a peptide-based adiponectin receptor agonist for cancer treatment.</a></h2><p>Adiponectin, a fat tissue-derived adipokine, exhibits beneficial effects against insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory conditions, and cancer. Circulating adiponectin levels are decreased in obese individuals, and this feature correlates with increased risk of developing several metabolic, immunological and neoplastic diseases. Thus, pharmacological replacement of adiponectin might prove clinically beneficial, especially for the obese patient population. At present, adiponectin-based therapeutics are not available, partly due to yet unclear structure/function relationships of the cytokine and difficulties in converting the full size adiponectin protein into a viable drug.We aimed to generate adiponectin-based short peptide that can mimic adiponectin action and be suitable for preclinical and clinical development as a cancer therapeutic. Using a panel of 66 overlapping 10 amino acid-long peptides covering the entire adiponectin globular domain (residues 105-254), we identified the 149-166 region as the adiponectin active site. Three-dimensional modeling of the active site and functional screening of additional 330 peptide analogs covering this region resulted in the development of a lead peptidomimetic, ADP 355 (H-DAsn--Pro-Nva--Tyr-DSer--Ala-DSer-NH2). In several adiponectin receptor-positive cancer cell lines, ADP 355 restricted proliferation in a dose-dependent manner at 100 nM-10 μM concentrations (exceeding the effects of 50 ng/mL globular adiponectin). Furthermore, ADP 355 modulated several key signaling pathways (AMPK, Akt, STAT3, ERK1/2) in an adiponectin-like manner. siRNA knockdown experiments suggested that ADP 355 effects can be transmitted through both adiponectin receptors, with a greater contribution of AdipoR1. In vivo, intraperitoneal administration of 1 mg/kg/day ADP 355 for 28 days suppressed the growth of orthotopic human breast cancer xenografts by ~31%. The peptide displayed excellent stability (at least 30 min) in mouse blood or serum and did not induce gross toxic effects at 5-50 mg/kg bolus doses in normal CBA/J mice.ADP 355 is a first-in-class adiponectin receptor agonist. Its biological activity, superior stability in biological fluids as well as acceptable toxicity profile indicate that the peptidomimetic represents a true lead compound for pharmaceutical development to replace low adiponectin levels in cancer and other malignancies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8118430>Effect of an antilipogenic fragment of human growth hormone on glucose transport in rat adipocytes.</a></h2><p>The effect of a synthetic C-terminal peptide sequence of human growth hormone, -Arg--Val-Gln-Cys-Arg-Val-Ser-Glu-Gly-Ser-Cys-Gly- (hGH 177-191) on glucose transport in adipocytes isolated from genetically-obese Zucker rats was investigated. The results showed that the synthetic peptide induced a reduction of basal and insulin-stimulated D[1-14C]-2-deoxyglucose uptake in isolated adipocytes. In comparison with the intact molecule of human growth hormone (hGH), the synthetic peptide at equimolar concentrations was found to be more potent. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that the functional domain responsible for the antilipogenic activity of hGH resides in the C-terminal region of the hGH molecule and the effect on glucose transport may contribute, at least in part, to the antilipogenic property of the peptide hGH 177-191 as well as of the intact hormone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14764812>Genetic screening for melanocortin-4 receptor mutations in a cohort of Italian obese patients: description and functional characterization of a novel mutation.</a></h2><p>Mutations in the human melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) gene may account for up to 5.8% of morbid nonsyndromic . We have screened 120 unrelated obese patients for variants of the MC4-R gene. Four heterozygous missense variants were detected, including two polymorphisms (Val(103) and (251)) previously described in the literature. A novel heterozygous mutation (Glu(308)Lys) was detected in a 36-yr-old female patient. Compared with the wild-type receptor, cells expressing the mutated receptor showed a reduced stimulation of cAMP production and a reduction of radioactive alpha MSH binding. No segregation of the mutation with the obese phenotype could be demonstrated. A second, potentially pathogenic mutation (Ser(30)) was detected in a 31-yr-old female patient. Functional analysis of the mutated receptor showed no change in the affinity to the natural ligand alpha MSH nor limited ability to stimulate cAMP production. Sixty lean subjects were also screened, and no additional variants of the MC4-R gene were observed, except for two individuals with the Val(103) polymorphism. In conclusion, we have screened a population of Italian obese subjects for MC4-R variants, demonstrating a 1.7% prevalence of potentially pathogenic mutations. A novel heterozygous missense mutation (Glu(308)Lys) that impairs MC4-R functional activity in vitro was characterized.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20042596>Structural basis for the association of the redox-sensitive target of rapamycin FATC domain with membrane-mimetic micelles.</a></h2><p>The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a conserved eukaryotic Ser/Thr kinase that regulates cellular growth in response to the nutrient and energy state. TOR signaling plays an important role in the development of diseases such as cancer, , and diabetes and in different redox-sensitive processes (hypoxia, apoptosis, and aging). Because TOR has been detected at different cellular membranes and in the nucleus, its localization may influence the specific signaling readout. To better understand how TOR can associate with different membranes, the lipid-binding properties of the redox-sensitive yeast TOR1 FATC domain (y1fatc) have been characterized by solution NMR spectroscopy. Binding studies with different lipids indicate that y1fatc interacts specifically with a membrane-mimetic environment but appears not to recognize a specific lipid headgroup. In both, the structures of oxidized and reduced micelle-bound y1fatc, residues -2456 to Trp-2470 of the lipid-binding motif form a hydrophobic bulb that has a rim of charged residues. The diffusion constants for both micelle-bound states are consistent with the rotational correlation times from the analysis of the (15)N relaxation data. Based on the K(d) values, the oxidized form (K(d) approximately 0.31 mm) binds dodecyl phosphocholine micelles slightly tighter than the reduced form (K(d) approximately 1.86 mM). Binding studies with y1fatc in which one or both tryptophans (Trp-2466 and Trp-2470) were replaced by alanine suggest that these residues are important for the exact positioning in the membrane and that the other aromatic (His-2462, Tyr-2463, and -2469) and aliphatic residues (-2456, -2459, -2464, and Pro-2468) in the lipid-binding motif contribute significantly to the affinity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11152298>The conformational and biological analysis of a cyclic anti- peptide from the C-terminal domain of human growth hormone.</a></h2><p>The three-dimensional solution structure of antiobesity drug (AOD), a 15-residue, disulfide-bonded, cyclic peptide, cyclo(6,13)-H2N--Arg--Val-Gln-Cys-Arg-Ser-Val-Glu-Gly-Ser-Cys-Gly--OH, derived from the C-terminal domain of the human growth hormone (hGH) (residues 177-191) was determined using two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. AOD stimulates lipolysis and inhibits lipogenesis, in vitro, in rodent, porcine and human adipose tissues. These biological effects suggest that AOD is a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of . Conformational studies of AOD were conducted in aqueous solution and in water/dimethylsulfoxide mixtures. In general, spectral quality was superior in the water/ dimethylsulfoxide mixtures. The cyclic region of AOD in water/dimethylsulfoxide adopts type I beta-turns at residues Ser8-Val9-Glu10-Gly11 and Ser12-Cys13-Gly14-Phe15, each preceded by loop-like structures. Comparison of the conformation of this peptide with residues 177-191 in the native hGH protein X-ray crystal structure indicates that the synthetic peptide retains some structural similarity to the intact protein. This study provides evidence that the C-terminal region of hGH is a specific functional domain of the multifunctional hGH protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25721149>A novel leptin antagonist peptide inhibits breast cancer growth in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>The role of the  cytokine leptin in breast cancer progression has raised interest in interfering with leptin's actions as a valuable therapeutic strategy. Leptin interacts with its receptor through three different binding sites: I-III. Site I is crucial for the formation of an active leptin-leptin receptor complex and in its subsequent activation. Amino acids 39-42 (-Asp--- LDFI) were shown to contribute to leptin binding site I and their mutations in alanine resulted in muteins acting as typical antagonists. We synthesized a small peptide based on the wild-type sequence of leptin binding site I (LDFI) and evaluated its efficacy in antagonizing leptin actions in breast cancer using in vitro and in vivo experimental models. The peptide LDFI abolished the leptin-induced anchorage-dependent and -independent growth as well as the migration of ERα-positive (MCF-7) and -negative (SKBR3) breast cancer cells. These results were well correlated with a reduction in the phosphorylation levels of leptin downstream effectors, as JAK2/STAT3/AKT/MAPK. Importantly, the peptide LDFI reversed the leptin-mediated up-regulation of its gene expression, as an additional mechanism able to enhance the peptide antagonistic activity. The described effects were specific for leptin signalling, since the developed peptide was not able to antagonize the other growth factors' actions on signalling activation, proliferation and migration. Finally, we showed that the LDFI pegylated peptide markedly reduced breast tumour growth in xenograft models. The unmodified peptide LDFI acting as a full leptin antagonist could become an attractive option for breast cancer treatment, especially in obese women.© 2015 The Authors.

Due to its multiple beneficial effects, GLP-1 has gained great attention for treatment of type 2 diabetes and . However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction of GLP-1 with the heptahelical core domain of GLP1R conferring high affinity ligand binding and ligand-induced receptor activation. Here, using chimeric and point-mutated GLP1R, we determined that the evolutionarily conserved amino acid residue Arg(380) flanked by hydrophobic (379) and (381) in extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) may have an interaction with Asp(9) and Gly(4) of the GLP-1 peptide. The molecular modeling study showed that (196) at transmembrane helix 2, Met(233) at ECL1, and Asn(302) at ECL2 of GLP1R have contacts with His(1) and Thr(7) of GLP-1. This study may shed light on the mechanism underlying high affinity interaction between the ligand and the binding pocket that is formed by these conserved residues in the GLP1R core domain.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336913>Leptin Modulates Exosome Biogenesis in Breast Cancer Cells: An Additional Mechanism in Cell-to-Cell Communication.</a></h2><p>Exosomes-small membrane vesicles secreted by both normal and malignant cells upon fusion of endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane-play an important role in cell-to-cell communication. During the last decade, several reports have highlighted the involvement of these nanovesicles in many aspects of breast cancer development and progression, but the extracellular signals governing their generation in breast cancer cells have not been completely unraveled. Here, we investigated the role of the  hormone leptin, a well-known adipokine implicated in mammary tumorigenesis, on the mechanisms regulating exosome biogenesis and release in both estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive MCF-7 and triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We found that leptin treatment enhanced the number of MVBs in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells and increased the amount of exosomes released in cell conditioned media. At molecular level, leptin increased the protein expression of Tsg101-a key component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport I (ESCRT-I)-by a post-transcriptional mechanism involving its direct interaction with the chaperone protein Hsp90. Targeting leptin signaling, by a selective leptin receptor antagonist the peptide LDFI (-Asp--), abrogated leptin effects on Tsg101 expression and on exosome secretion in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, our findings, identifying for the first time leptin/leptin receptor/Hsp90 axis as an important regulator of exosome generation in mammary carcinoma cells, suggest that targeting this signaling pathway might represent a novel therapeutic strategy to impair exosome secretion and interrupt the dangerous cell-to-cell communication in breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28378845>Central adiposity-induced plasma-free amino acid alterations are associated with increased insulin resistance in healthy Singaporean adults.</a></h2><p>Recent metabolomics technique reveals a plasma-free amino acid (PFAA)-based metabolite signature that is suggestive of altered PFAAs being an early manifestation of -related insulin resistance. However, the PFAA profiles within non-obese, but more insulin-resistant Asians are not well researched. Compared with Caucasians, Asian populations have more central adiposity, which is generally regarded as metabolically more adverse, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we examined whether PFAA profiling was at least one important factor mediating central adiposity and insulin resistance, and aid in cardiovascular risk assessment in healthy Asians with normal body weight.This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 190 healthy men (n=87 with a mean±s.d. body mass index (BMI) of 23.5±3.5 kg/m) and women (n=103 with a mean±s.d. BMI of 21.4±3.7 kg/m) residing in Singapore took part in this study. PFAA levels were measured by using an amino acid analyzer. Basic anthropometric measurements, fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin and lipid profiles were obtained using standard protocols.Seven out of 18 amino acids were significantly correlated with measures of  (for example, waist circumference; waist-to-hip ratio and BMI) in current participants. Among them, the plasma concentrations of five amino acids, including , Tyr, Met, Ala and His were positively associated with waist-to-hip ratio. With the exception of His, which had no association with insulin resistance, , Tyr, Met and Ala were significantly associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (P<0.05). In contrast, no associations were observed between circulating BCAAs (that is, Val, , ), measures of  and insulin resistance. However, significant inverse associations were observed between BCAAs and total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein.We found that central adiposity was associated with alterations of specific amino acids. As a result, PFAAs may serve as metabolite predictors of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia in healthy participants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22511205>Metabolic signatures of insulin resistance in 7,098 young adults.</a></h2><p>Metabolite associations with insulin resistance were studied in 7,098 young Finns (age 31 ± 3 years; 52% women) to elucidate underlying metabolic pathways. Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model (HOMA-IR) and circulating metabolites quantified by high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in two population-based cohorts. Associations were analyzed using regression models adjusted for age, waist, and standard lipids. Branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, gluconeogenesis intermediates, ketone bodies, and fatty acid composition and saturation were associated with HOMA-IR (P < 0.0005 for 20 metabolite measures). , , Val, and Tyr displayed sex- and -dependent interactions, with associations being significant for women only if they were abdominally obese. Origins of fasting metabolite levels were studied with dietary and physical activity data. Here, protein energy intake was associated with Val, , Tyr, and Gln but not insulin resistance index. We further tested if 12 genetic variants regulating the metabolites also contributed to insulin resistance. The genetic determinants of metabolite levels were not associated with HOMA-IR, with the exception of a variant in GCKR associated with 12 metabolites, including amino acids (P < 0.0005). Nonetheless, metabolic signatures extending beyond  and lipid abnormalities reflected the degree of insulin resistance evidenced in young, normoglycemic adults with sex-specific fingerprints.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10199800>Several mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene including a nonsense and a frameshift mutation associated with dominantly inherited  in humans.</a></h2><p>The melanocortin-4 receptor gene (MC4-R) has been implicated in weight regulation. Recently, two independent groups reported frameshift mutations associated with a dominant form of  (1, 2). We screened the coding region of the MC4-R in 306 extremely obese children and adolescents (mean body mass index: BMI 34.4 +/- 6.6 kg/m2), 25 healthy underweight students (mean BMI 17.1 +/- 0.8 kg/m2), 52 normal weight individuals (mean BMI 22.0 +/- 1.0 kg/m2), 51 inpatients with anorexia nervosa (AN, DSM IV criteria, mean BMI 14.3 +/- 1.5 kg/m2) and 27 patients with bulimia nervosa (BN, DSM IV criteria, mean BMI 21.7 +/- 5.8 kg/m2) by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP). Several mutations were identified, including the frameshift mutation described (1). The mutations were as follows: a) The deletion of 4 bp (delta of CTCT at codon 211) results in a frameshift, thus rendering a truncated protein. This mutation has been assumed to be associated with dominantly-inherited morbid  in humans (1). Both the index patient (BMI 42.06 kg/m2, height 171 cm, age 19.6 years) and her mother (BMI 37.55 kg/m2, height 164 cm, age 42.5 years) were heterozygous for the deletion. b) A nonsense mutation at position 35 of the MC4-R was detected in two obese probands (BMI 31.29 kg/m2 and BMI 45.91 kg/m2). This mutation leads to a truncated protein that encompasses the N-terminal extracellular domain. Both carriers additionally showed (c) a missense mutation (Asp-37-Val). In both of these cases Tyr-35-Stop and Asp-37-Val were maternally transmitted, thus these variations form a haplotype. d) e) A male obese proband harbored two missense mutations (Ser-30-, Gly-252-Ser). f)-i) Four different missense mutations (Pro-78-, Thr-112-Met, Arg-165-Trp, -317-Thr) were detected in four different male probands, respectively. All of these mutations (a to i) were found solely in extremely obese individuals whose BMIs were all above the 99th percentile. j) A silent mutation (C-579-T, Val-193-Val) was detected in a male underweight individual. k) A previously described polymorphism (Val-103-; 3) was detected with similar frequencies in all different study groups. 1) We identified a novel polymorphism (-251-) with similar allele frequencies in all groups under study. In conclusion, our data indicate that mutations in the MC4-R are not uncommon. Whereas our data support the evidence for dominantly inherited  as revealed by the three obese probands with haplo-insufficiency, the functional significance of the missense mutations remains to be determined.</p></html>
