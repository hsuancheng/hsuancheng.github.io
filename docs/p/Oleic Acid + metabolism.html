Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, lipid , and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty  (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose .Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of  (OA), linoleic  (LA), and arachidonic  (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30923965>Sources of microbial oils with emphasis to Mortierella (Umbelopsis) isabellina fungus.</a></h2><p>The last years a constantly rising number of publications have appeared in the literature in relation to the production of oils and fats deriving from microbial sources (the "single cell oils"-SCOs). SCOs can be used as precursors for the synthesis of lipid-based biofuels or employed as substitutes of expensive oils rarely found in the plant or animal kingdom. In the present review-article, aspects concerning SCOs (economics, biochemistry, substrates, technology, scale-up), with emphasis on the potential of Mortierella isabellina were presented. Fats and hydrophilic substrates have been used as carbon sources for cultivating Zygomycetes. Among them, wild-type M. isabellina strains have been reported as excellent SCO-producers, with conversion yields on sugar consumed and lipid in DCW values reported comparable to the maximum ones achieved for genetically engineered SCO-producing strains. Lipids produced on glucose contain γ-linolenic  (GLA), a polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) of high dietary and pharmaceutical importance, though in low concentrations. Nevertheless, due to their abundance in , these lipids are perfect precursors for the synthesis of 2nd generation biodiesel, while GLA can be recovered and directed to other usages. Genetic engineering focusing on over-expression of Δ6 and Δ12 desaturases and of C16 elongase may improve the fatty  composition (viz. increasing the concentration of GLA or other nutritionally important PUFAs) of these lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30835849>Extraction Technology Can Impose Influences on Peanut Oil Functional Quality: A Study to Investigate the Lipid  by Sprague-Dawley Rat Model.</a></h2><p>In this study, peanut oil was prepared by cold pressing (temperature under 60 °C), hot pressing (temperature above 105 °C), and enzyme-assisted aqueous extraction technology. Influences of an extraction technology on the oil fatty  composition and the content of minor bioactive compounds, including tocopherols, polyphenols, and squalene, were investigated in detail. High-fat-diet Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model was then established to probe the impact of cold-pressed peanut oil (CPO), hot-pressed peanut oil (HPO), and enzyme-assisted aqueous-extracted peanut oil (EAO) on lipid  outcomes, to explore influences of different extraction technologies on lipid functional quality. Results showed that  was the predominate fatty  in the EAO (52.57 ± 0.11%), which was also significantly higher (P < 0.05) than CPO and HPO. The HPO showed higher total tocopherol and polyphenol contents (206.84 ± 6.93 mg/kg and 47.87 ± 6.50 mg GA/kg, respectively) than CPO and EAO (P < 0.05). However, the squalene content in CPO was 475.47 ± 12.75 mg/kg, which was the highest among the three oils (P < 0.05). The animal experiment results revealed that EAO could be more prone to induce lipid accumulation in the liver, which may likely to cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the serum lipid profiles indicated that the CPO was more beneficial than the EAO and HPO in lowering the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase contents, and increasing the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol content. All of our efforts indicated that an extraction technology can affect the peanut oil lipid fatty  composition, the bioactive compounds content, and, correspondingly, the lipid  in SD rats.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30991133>The roles of short and long chain fatty acids on physicochemical properties and improved cancer targeting of albumin-based fattigation-platform nanoparticles containing doxorubicin.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different chain length fatty acids on physicochemical properties and cancer targeting of fattigation-platform nanoparticles (NPs). Two different types of fatty acids (short chain, 2-hydroxybutyric , C4; long chain, , C18:1) were successfully conjugated to human serum albumin (HSA) via simple 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) coupling reaction. These conjugates readily formed HSA-C4 and HSA-C18:1 NPs which showed good stability in serum and desirable biocompatibility with normal cell line (HEK293T). Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) was efficiently loaded into NPs by incubation process via electrostatic interaction. The structure, morphology, and texture of DOX-loaded NPs were characterized by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) equipped with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The initial burst release of DOX-loaded NPs was controlled by the presence and chain length of fatty acids. In vitro cytotoxicity studies with three cancer cell lines (A549, HT-29, and PANC-1) suggested that fattigation-platform NPs have distinctive cytotoxic effects compared to Doxil. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry exhibited that the cellular uptake of DOX-loaded NPs was varied by the different chain lengths of fatty acids. It was evident that the chain length of fatty acids in the fattigation-platform NPs could play a vital role in varying physicochemical properties and cancer cell targeting of NPs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the in vitro effects of ZER on lipid peroxidation in biological systems (cholesterol and phospholipid membrane oxidation) and explores its antitumor action in terms of its ability to modulate cancer cell lipid profile. Evaluation of the antioxidant activity of ZER showed that this compound is unable to trap lipoperoxyl radicals per se. ZER significantly modulated the total lipid and fatty  profiles in cancer cells, inducing marked changes in the phospholipid/cholesterol ratio, with significant decreases in the levels of  and palmitic acids and a marked increase of stearic . Cell-based fluorescent measurements of intracellular membranes and lipid droplets using the Nile Red staining technique showed that in cancer cells, ZER induced significant accumulation of cytosolic lipid droplets and altered cell membrane organization/protein dynamics, depolarizing the mitochondrial membranes and inducing apoptosis and alteration of nuclear morphology. The modulatory activity of ZER on the total lipid and fatty  profiles and lipid droplets may therefore represent another possible mechanism of its anticancer properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738430>Trans-vaccenic  inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells via a mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway.</a></h2><p>Intake of trans fatty acids (TFAs) from partially hydrogenated vegetable oil is associated with a variety of adverse outcomes, but little is known about the health effects of ruminant trans fats. Trans-vaccenic  (TVA) is a naturally occurring TFA found in the fat of ruminants and in human dairy products. The present study was conducted to investigate the anticancer activity and underlying mechanisms of TVA on human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) 5-8F and CNE-2 cells.A CCK8 assay was used to determine the effect of TVA and the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 on the proliferation of NPC cells. Apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of factors associated with Bcl-2-family protein signaling and Akt signaling.TVA significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that TVA significantly decreased p-Akt levels and Bad phosphorylation on Ser-136 and Ser-112. More importantly, we discovered that the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 synergistically sensitized NPC cells to apoptosis induction by TVA.TVA can inhibit NPC cell growth and induced apoptosis through the inhibition of Bad/Akt phosphorylation. The combined use of TVA and Mcl-1 inhibitors offers a potential advantage for nasopharyngeal cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260961>Phenolic, oxylipin and fatty  profiles of the Chilean hazelnut (Gevuina avellana): Antioxidant activity and inhibition of pro-inflammatory and  syndrome-associated enzymes.</a></h2><p>Roasted cotyledons of the Chilean hazelnut (Gevuina avellana) are appreciated as snacks. The aim of our work was to assess the fatty , oxylipin and phenolic composition using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), ultra- high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to MS and HPLC coupled to diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Additionally, various antioxidant activities were assessed. The inhibition of α-glucosidase, α-amylase, lipase, cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1/COX-2), and lipoxygenase was determined. The main fatty acids were  and 7-hexadecenoic acids. Eight phytoprostanes and three phytofurans were identified and quantified. Hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids were the main phenolic compounds. Oils showed antioxidant activity determined by EPR, and inhibition of COX-1/COX-2. The statistical analysis showed that the roasting does not affect the composition of the samples. The occurrence of oxylipins in this species is reported for the first time.

Antisteatotic effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeONPs) have recently been shown in animal models of liver disease. However, it is unclear whether the activity of CeONPs is related solely to the decrease in oxidative stress or, in addition, they directly decrease liver fatty  accumulation. To address this question, in this work, we used an in vitro model of hepatocellular steatosis, exposing HepG2 cells to  and palmitic . Cell uptake of CeONPs and their effect on oxidative stress and viability of hepatic cells cultured with HO were also evaluated. Results show that CeONPs were uptaken by HepG2 cells and reduced oxidative stress and improved cell viability. Treatment with  and palmitic  increased lipogenesis and the content of different fatty acids. CeONPs reduced palmitic and stearic  and most fatty acids consisting of more than 18 carbon atoms. These effects were associated with significant changes in elongase and desaturase activity. In conclusion, CeONPs directly protected HepG2 cells from cell injury in oxidative stress conditions and reduced fatty  content in steatotic conditions by inducing specific changes in fatty  , thus showing potential in the treatment of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31092795>Examination of the Catabolic Rates of C-Labeled Fatty Acids Bound to the α and β Positions of Triacylglycerol Using CO Expired from Mice.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids in triacylglycerol (TAG) are catabolized after digestion. However, the catabolic rates of several fatty acids bound to the α (sn-1, 3) or β (sn-2) position of TAG have not been thoroughly compared. In this study, the catabolic rates of C-labeled palmitic , , linoleic , α-linolenic , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), or docosahexaenoic  (DHA) bound to the α and β position of TAG were compared using isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The catabolic rates of the studied fatty acids were evaluated using the ratio of C and C in carbon dioxide expired from mice. The results indicated that palmitic , , or α-linolenic  bound to the β position was slowly catabolized for a long duration compared to that when bound to the α position. In contrast, EPA bound to the β position was quickly catabolized, and EPA bound to the α position was slowly catabolized for a long time. For linoleic  or DHA, no difference in the catabolic rates was detected between the binding positions in TAG. Furthermore, EPA and DHA were less catabolized than the other fatty acids. These results indicate that the catabolic rates of fatty acids are influenced by their binding positions in TAG and that this influence on the catabolic rate differed depending on the fatty  species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083505>Protective Effects of Licochalcone A Ameliorates Obesity and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Via Promotion of the Sirt-1/AMPK Pathway in Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>Licochalcone A is a chalcone isolated from . It showed anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory properties in mice with acute lung injuries and regulated lipid  through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hepatocytes. However, the effects of licochalcone A on reducing weight gain and improving nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are unclear. Thus, the present study investigated whether licochalcone A ameliorated weight loss and lipid  in the liver of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed an HFD to induce obesity and NAFLD, and then were injected intraperitoneally with licochalcone A. In another experiment, a fatty liver cell model was established by incubating HepG2 hepatocytes with  and treating the cells with licochalcone A to evaluate lipid . Our results demonstrated that HFD-induced obese mice treated with licochalcone A had decreased body weight as well as inguinal and epididymal adipose tissue weights compared with HFD-treated mice. Licochalcone A also ameliorated hepatocyte steatosis and decreased liver tissue weight and lipid droplet accumulation in liver tissue. We also found that licochalcone A significantly regulated serum triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and free fatty acids, and decreased the fasting blood glucose value. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro, licochalcone A significantly decreased expression of the transcription factor of lipogenesis and fatty  synthase. Licochalcone A activated the sirt-1/AMPK pathway to reduce fatty  chain synthesis and increased lipolysis and β-oxidation in hepatocytes. Licochalcone A can potentially ameliorate obesity and NAFLD in mice via activation of the sirt1/AMPK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293035>DFCP1 associates with lipid droplets.</a></h2><p>Double FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1) is ubiquitously expressed, participates in intracellular membrane trafficking and labels omegasomes through specific interactions with phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P). Previous studies showed that subcellular DFCP1 proteins display multi-organelle localization, including in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus and mitochondria. However, its localization and function on lipid droplets (LDs) remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that DFCP1 localizes to the LD upon  incubation. The ER-targeted domain of DFCP1 is indispensable for its LD localization, which is further enhanced by double FYVE domains. Inhibition of PI3P binding at the FYVE domain through wortmannin treatment or double mutation at C654S and C770S have no effect on DFCP1's LD localization. These show that the mechanisms for DFCP1 targeting the omegasome and LDs are different. DFCP1 deficiency in MEF cells causes an increase in LD number and reduces LD size. Interestingly, DFCP1 interacts with GTP-bound Rab18, an LD-associated protein.

In this study, we performed whole-genome resequencing on eight animals with higher and lower C18:1 to identify candidate polymorphisms for the QTL. A total of 39,658 polymorphisms were detected in the candidate region, which were narrowed to 1993 polymorphisms within 23 genes based on allele differences between the high and low C18:1 groups. We subsequently selected three candidate genes, that is, CYB5R4, MED23, and VNN1, among the 23 genes based on their function in fatty  . In each candidate gene, three SNPs, that is, CYB5R4 c.*349G > T, MED23 c.3700G > A, and VNN1 c.197C > T, were selected as candidate SNPs to verify their effect on C18:1 in a Japanese Black cattle population (n = 889). The statistical analysis showed that these SNPs were significantly associated with C18:1 (p < 0.05), suggesting that they were candidates for the QTL. In conclusion, we successfully narrowed the candidates for the QTL by detecting possible polymorphisms located within the candidate region.

Transdermal drug delivery is hypothesized as an alternative to conventional therapies to alleviate its adverse effects. In our study, MTX was entrapped in deformable liposomes and loaded in a hydroxyethyl cellulose gel. This system was evaluated by the Box Behnken statistical design for optimization. The effect of formulation variables on particle size, entrapment and ex vivo skin permeation was studied. The MTX nanogel was evaluated for its dermal toxicity (acute and repeat dose safety), in vivo biodistribution (using I radio-labelled MTX) and therapeutic efficacy (collagen induced arthritis [CIA] model). The optimized formulation demonstrated appreciable nanosize (110 ± 20 nm), drug entrapment (42 ± 1.9%) and high ex vivo transdermal flux (17.37 ± 1.5 μg/cm2/hr). In the dermal toxicity studies, nanogel formulation did not show any signs of irritation or toxicity, whereas in the biodistribution study, the MTX nanogel formulation depicted sustained systemic delivery up to 48 h with low accumulation in its organs of toxicity such as the liver, kidneys and gut. In the CIA model, the MTX nanogel significantly ameliorated hind paw swelling, reduced arthritic score, joint damage (histological, radiological examination) and attenuated the rise in serum cytokines such as TNF-ɑ and IL-6. In conclusion, the optimized MTX nanogel formulation displayed skin biocompatibility, sustained systemic delivery, safety as well as therapeutic efficacy.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In the strive for the best kinetic parameters of biological organisms without a possibility of modifying physicochemical and biochemical reactions in the mitochondrial matrix, the mitochondria can be provided with a substrate that increases energy production efficiency and the amount of ATP. Physicochemical parameters of  MFA has become the standard of an oxidation substrate for in vivo energy production; this MFA was synthesized in organisms for millions of years. Environmental influences are the second factor which determines kinetic perfection of biological organisms during phylogenesis. Are these influences always beneficial? Mostly, they are not. However, they largely stimulate adaptive functions of the organism, including the biological function of locomotion, cognitive function and the function of positioning in the environment. Biological, energy and kinetic perfection formed in vivo can be easily destroyed if phylogenetically herbivorous Homo sapiens abuses the diet of carnivorous animals (meat) which was not consumed by him and his ancestors during phylogenesis. This abuse is the major cause of  pandemias in human population. They are: insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, obesity and nonalcoholic liver disease. The most effective measures preventing  pandemias, cardiac heart disease and myocardial infarction are extremely simple.

Although polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have attracted attention in the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry, their role in eating disorders remains unknown. This meta-analysis investigates the differences of PUFA levels between patients with eating disorders and healthy controls, and the potentially beneficial effects of PUFAs in such patients.We conducted a systematic literature search and meta-analysis under the random effects model.Eleven studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Compared with controls, 379 patients with eating disorders had significantly higher plasma levels of alpha-linolenic , eicosapentaenoic , stearidonic , osbond , palmitoleic , , and total omega-3 fatty acids; and lower levels of total omega-6 fatty acids and omega-6/omega-3 ratio. Eating disorders were associated with significantly higher red blood cell membrane levels of palmitoleic  and  and lower levels of adrenic , arachidonic , and total omega-6 fatty acids. In addition, PUFA supplements were associated with a benefit to body weight outcomes but not disease severity and mood symptoms in interventional trials.This meta-analysis indicates abnormal levels of PUFAs in peripheral blood tissues in patients with eating disorders. The relationship between PUFAs and eating disorders should be interpreted cautiously considering the specific lipid  under starvation state. To investigate the role of PUFAs on psychopathological and therapeutic effects in eating disorders, further larger clinical studies are warranted.Copyright © 2019.

This study aimed at introducing advanced techniques to characterize nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) comprising palmitic , , stabilizer and Domperidone. Crystallinity of single components and mixtures was investigated by laboratory Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). NLC were studied with laboratory Small and Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (SWAXS). Photon Correlation Spectroscopy and Freeze Fracture Transmission Electron Microscopy were used to monitor particle size, zeta potential and shape. Stability of NLC was investigated using synchrotron X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and SAXS and laboratory SAXS. Palmitic  showed a lamellar structure (polymorph C), which was still present after particle preparation. Spherical 300 nm-sized particles with zeta potential values above -30 mV were obtained and Domperidone was incorporated in its amorphous form. During storage, no differences in synchrotron XRD spectra were seen. However, laboratory SAXS measurements showed a second lamellar structure, identified as polymorph B. Synchrotron SAXS temperature scans confirmed that polymorph B did not affect the morphology of the encapsulated drug or the shape of NLC. These results highlight the unique capabilities of laboratory and synchrotron X-ray Scattering and Diffraction for improved structural characterization of lipid nanoparticles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To test the hypothesis of dietary resource partitioning between batoids within a communal nursery, we investigated two cownose ray species, Rhinoptera bonasus and R. brasiliensis, which occur in heterospecific groups, a strategy predicted to increase survival and foraging success. Using two biochemical tracers, fatty acids (FA) and stable isotopes (δ N and δ C), the combined effects of maternal investment and the formation of heterospecific groups implying competition for, or partitioning of available food resources were investigated. Through univariate and multivariate analyses of biochemical tracers in several tissues (fin clip, muscle, liver, red blood cells; RBC) and plasma, our results revealed significant interspecific differences in tracers between the two species. Total FAs (∑saturated FA, ∑monounsaturated FA and ∑polyunsaturated FA) and trophic biomarkers (i.e., docosahexaenoic , arachidonic ,  and δ N) were the principle tracers responsible for the differences detected. These data revealed that R. brasiliensis was less enriched in physiologically important essential FAs than R. bonasus. Our findings suggest that these congeneric species differ in maternal investment strategy and moderately partition food resources over relatively fine spatial scales within a single nursery habitat to limit competition. These results provide further knowledge on the foraging strategies adopted by batoids in communal nursery areas, information that is required for improving spatial conservation and management planning.© 2019 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160717>SIRT3 promotes lipophagy and chaperon-mediated autophagy to protect hepatocytes against lipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Lipophagy is a lysosomal lipolytic pathway that complements the actions of cytosolic neutral lipases. Chaperon-mediated autophagy (CMA) triggers lipid droplets (LDs) breakdown, to initiate lipolysis via either cytosolic lipases or macroautophagy. SIRT3, a mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase, regulates the acetylation status and activity of many substrates involving in energy . However, the role of SIRT3 in regulating lipophagy is controversial. The current study showed that SIRT3 expression was decreased and the macroautophagy flux was blocked in the primary hepatocytes from high-fat diet fed mice and P/O (palmitic  and  mixture) treated AML12 mouse hepatocytes, compared with the corresponding controls. SIRT3 overexpression promoted macroautophagy in LDs from P/O-treated hepatocytes through activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and unc-51-like kinase 1, to boost LDs digestion. Gain of SIRT3 expression stimulated the formation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A)-heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC70)-perilipin-2 (PLN2) complex, to promote CMA process and reduce the stability of LDs in hepatocytes. Moreover, SIRT3 reduced the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, to suppress lipogenesis. In addition, SIRT3 overexpression promoted LDs dispersion on detyrosinated microtubules, and directly deacetylated long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to enhance mitochondrial energetics. Taken together, SIRT3 ameliorates lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, which might be a potential target for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866181>Single Cell Oil Production from Undetoxified  L. hydrolysate by .</a></h2><p>The use of low-cost substrates represents one key issue to make single cell oil production sustainable.

The present study investigated the ameliorative effects of EMO on high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and explored relative regulation mechanism. The analysis of EMO fatty acids showed that EMO rich in unsaturated fatty acids (92.07%), such as linoleic  (48.24%),  (34.20%) and linolenic  (7.57%). In addition, supplementation of EMO could ameliorate the increase in body weight, fat weight, and abnormal serum lipids induced by high-fat diet. A further important implication is that the levels of serum ALT, serum AST, hepatic TG, TC, SOD, GSH/GSSG ration and MDA were improved after supplementing with EMO. All these changes may be due to the ability of EMO to inhibit fatty  synthesis via reducing the mRNA expression of SREBP-1c, PPARγ and FAS, and elevate fatty  oxidation by increasing the mRNA expression of PPARα and CPT-1. Meanwhile, our results also showed that endogenously synthesized n-3 PUFAs could significantly increase after treating with EMO. In conclusion, the results suggested that EMO could be regarded as a healthy food for preventing NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31054672>A worldwide reliable indicator to differentiate wild vs. farmed Penaeid shrimps based on 207 fatty  profiles.</a></h2><p>Shrimps and prawns are especially subject to food fraud, which has consequences not only on the economy but also represents a potential risk for public health. Fatty acids (FA) of Penaeid shrimps have been largely explored in the literature, and although they are unable to discriminate shrimps geographical origin or species, they might provide an interesting tool to distinguish their production method (wild vs. farmed). The present study is based on a literature compilation of Penaeid shrimp FA profiles encompassing all continents and 28 species. It reveals that the ratio of FA 18:2ω6 + FA 18:3ω3 / FA 16:1ω7 can differentiate wild vs. farmed Penaeid shrimps with 100% accuracy within the 207 FA profiles of the dataset considered. Assuming a normal distribution of the dataset, 94.4% of the farmed shrimps population is expected to exhibit a ratio above 2.92, and 99.7% of the wild shrimps population is expected to fall below 2.92.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We have shown that ethanol consumption leads to microtubule hyperacetylation that can explain ethanol-induced defects in protein trafficking. Because almost all steps of the lipid droplet life cycle are microtubule dependent and because microtubule acetylation promotes adipogenesis, we examined droplet dynamics in ethanol-treated cells. In WIF-B cells treated with ethanol and/or  (a fatty  associated with the "Western" diet), we found that ethanol dramatically increased lipid droplet numbers and led to the formation of large, peripherally located droplets. Enhanced droplet formation required alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated ethanol , and peripheral droplet distributions required intact microtubules. We also determined that ethanol-induced microtubule acetylation led to impaired droplet degradation. Live-cell imaging revealed that droplet motility was microtubule dependent and that droplets were virtually stationary in ethanol-treated cells. To determine more directly whether microtubule hyperacetylation could explain impaired droplet motility, we overexpressed the tubulin-specific acetyltransferase αTAT1 to promote microtubule acetylation in the absence of alcohol. Droplet motility was impaired in αTAT1-expressing cells but to a lesser extent than in ethanol-treated cells. However, in both cases, the large immotile droplets (but not small motile ones) colocalized with dynein and dynactin (but not kinesin), implying that altered droplet-motor microtubule interactions may explain altered dynamics. These studies further suggest that modulating cellular acetylation is a potential strategy for treating alcoholic liver disease. Chronic alcohol consumption with the "Western diet" enhances the development of fatty liver and leads to impaired droplet motility, which may have serious deletrious effects on hepatocyte function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035475>Time-Course Proteomic Analysis of  KT2440 during Mcl-Polyhydroxyalkanoate Synthesis under Nitrogen Deficiency.</a></h2><p>Medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHAs) have gained great attention as a new green alternative to petrochemical-derived polymers. Due to their outstanding material properties they can be used in a wide range of applications.  KT2440 is a metabolically versatile producer of mcl-polyhydroxyalkanoates. Although the  of polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis by this bacterium has been extensively studied, the comparative proteome analysis from three growth stages of  KT2440 cultured with  during mcl-PHA synthesis has not yet been reported. Therefore; the aim of the study was to compare the proteome of  KT2440 at different time points of its cultivation using the 2D difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) technique. The analyses showed that low levels of a nitrogen source were beneficial for mcl-PHA synthesis. Proteomic analysis revealed that the proteins associated with carbon  were affected by nitrogen starvation and mcl-PHA synthesis. Furthermore, the induction of proteins involved in nitrogen , ribosome synthesis, and transport was observed, which may be the cellular response to stress related to nitrogen deficiency and mcl-PHA content in bacterial cells. To sum up; this study enabled the investigators to acquire a better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis and accumulation in  KT2440 that could lead to improved strategies for PHAs in industrial production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993530>Analysis of Fatty  Esters of Hydroxyl Fatty  in Selected Plant Food.</a></h2><p> syndrome, characterized by obesity, low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Preclinical studies on recently discovered classes of lipids - fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) have revealed their anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing potential. The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (palmitic, , palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic  hydroxy stearic  (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial  effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi). Our study proves the importance of overall FAHFA analysis in food (especially in a functional food), because of their potential  benefits and possible future incorporation in special diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201542>Fatty  profiles of the European migratory common noctule bat (Nyctalus noctula).</a></h2><p>In animals, fatty acids (FA) are essential as structural components in membranes and for energy storage in adipocytes. Here, we studied the relative proportions of FA in a mammal with extreme changes in  rates. Common noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) switch from energetically demanding long-distance migration at high  rates to regular torpor with extremely low  rates. We found that composition of FA categories differed between adipose tissue types (white adipose tissue (WAT) vs brown adipose tissue (BAT)) and muscle tissue types (skeletal vs heart), but not between sexes. We found  to be the most abundant FA in all studied tissues. Concentrations of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were not always higher in muscular tissue compared with adipocyte tissue, even though high concentrations of PUFA are considered beneficial for low body temperatures in torpor. In all tissues, we observed a high content in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), possibly to compensate for a low PUFA content in the diet. Ratios of ω6/ω3 were lower in the heart than in skeletal muscles of common noctules. Three FA (palmitic, , and linoleic ) accounted for about 70% of the FA in adipose tissue, which is similar to proportions observed in migrating birds, yet migrating birds generally have a higher PUFA content in muscle and adipose tissues than bats. Bats seem to contrast with other mammals in having a high MUFA content in all tissues. We conclude that FA profiles of bats differ largely from those of most cursorial mammals and instead are-with the exception of MUFA-similar to those of migrating birds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830512>Increased urea availability promotes adjustments in C/N  and lipid content without impacting growth in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.</a></h2><p>The use of urea as a nitrogen (N) source by Chlorophytes usually enhances biomass and lipid production when compared to ammonium (NH).

In addition, GC analysis was used to determine fatty  profiling.The use of urea did not alter the growth rate in comparison with NH. Interestingly, the cell number decreased and the cell size increased proportionally with urea availability. Furthermore, chlorophyll, protein and lipid contents increased with the amount of urea. Regarding the fatty  profile,  (C18:1 w8) decreased with amount of urea, while linoleic  (C18:2 w6) doubled in urea-containing medium.These results indicate that urea promotes remarkable adjustments in , without drastic changes in biomass, promoting changes in carbohydrate and amino  , as well as in lipids production and fatty  profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31119400>Dietary habits affect fatty  composition of visceral adipose tissue in subjects with colorectal cancer or obesity.</a></h2><p>Aim of this study was to identify a possible relationship among dietary fatty acids (FA) intake, FA adipose tissue (AT) profile and cancer condition in lean vs obese subjects affected or not by colorectal cancer (CRC). Actually, inadequate dietary habits together with physical inactivity are primary determinants of obesity and cancer risk. Changes in lipid  play a crucial role in different types of cancer and key enzymes involved in lipid- , such as stearoyl-coA-desaturase 1 (SCD-1), are differentially expressed in normal and cancer tissues.Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) were analyzed by Winfood software. FA were assessed by gas-liquid chromatography in visceral AT samples. Estimated desaturase activities were calculated as precursor FA/product FA ratio. Desaturase gene expressions were evaluated by RT-qPCR.Lean and obese CRC subjects showed inadequate dietary habits. In particular, lean CRC subjects showed increase in the intake of saturated FA, specifically palmitic (p = 0.0042) and stearic  (p = 0.0091), and a corresponding reduction of monounsaturated FA consumption, in particular  (p = 0.002) with respect to lean without CRC. Estimated SCD-1 activity in AT was increased in all the groups vs lean without CRC (pANOVA = 0.029).Unhealthy eating habits, characterizing obese and CRC subjects, may influence the visceral AT profile and contribute to the alteration of the  .

Here we show that nuclear LDs in hepatocytes are derived from apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-free lumenal LDs, a precursor to very low-density lipoproprotein (VLDL) generated in the ER lumen by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. ApoB-free lumenal LDs accumulate under ER stress, grow within the lumen of the type I nucleoplasmic reticulum, and turn into nucleoplasmic LDs by disintegration of the surrounding inner nuclear membrane.  with or without tunicamycin significantly increases the formation of nucleoplasmic LDs, to which CDP-choline diacylglycerol phosphotransferase α (CCTα) is recruited, resulting in activation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis. Perilipin-3 competes with CCTα in binding to nucleoplasmic LDs, and thus, knockdown and overexpression of perilipin-3 increases and decreases PC synthesis, respectively. The results indicate that nucleoplasmic LDs in hepatocytes constitute a feedback mechanism to regulate PC synthesis in accordance with ER stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30922300> engineering of Ashbya gossypii for deciphering the de novo biosynthesis of γ-lactones.</a></h2><p>Lactones are highly valuable cyclic esters of hydroxy fatty acids that find application as pure fragrances or as building blocks of speciality chemicals. While chemical synthesis often leads to undesired racemic mixtures, microbial production allows obtaining optically pure lactones. The production of a specific lactone by biotransformation depends on the supply of the corresponding hydroxy fatty , which has economic and industrial value similar to γ-lactones. Hence, the identification and exploration of microorganisms with the rare natural ability for de novo biosynthesis of lactones will contribute to the long-term sustainability of microbial production. In this study, the innate ability of Ashbya gossypii for de novo production of γ-lactones from glucose was evaluated and improved.Characterization of the volatile organic compounds produced by nine strains of this industrial filamentous fungus in glucose-based medium revealed the noteworthy presence of seven chemically different γ-lactones. To decipher and understand the de novo biosynthesis of γ-lactones from glucose, we developed  engineering strategies focused on the fatty  biosynthesis and the β-oxidation . Overexpression of AgDES589, encoding a desaturase for the conversion of  (C18:1) into linoleic  (C18:2), and deletion of AgELO624, which encodes an elongase that catalyses the formation of C20:0 and C22:0 fatty acids, greatly increased the production of γ-lactones (up to 6.4-fold; (7.6 ± 0.8) × 10 µg/g). Further substitution of AgPOX1, encoding the exclusive acyl-CoA oxidase in A. gossypii, by a codon-optimized POX2 gene from Yarrowia lipolytica, which encodes a specific long chain acyl-CoA oxidase, fine-tuned the biosynthesis of γ-decalactone to a relative production of more than 99%.This study demonstrates the potential of A. gossypii as a model and future platform for de novo biosynthesis of γ-lactones. By means of  engineering, key enzymatic steps involved in their production were elucidated. Moreover, the combinatorial  engineering strategies developed resulted in improved de novo biosynthesis of γ-decalactone. In sum, these proof-of-concept data revealed yet unknown  and genetic determinants important for the future exploration of the de novo production of γ-lactones as an alternative to biotransformation processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30710768>Letter to the editor.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354792>Co-Expression  Reveal Potential Regulatory Roles of miRNAs in Fatty  Composition of Nelore Cattle.</a></h2><p>Fatty  (FA) content affects the sensorial and nutritional value of meat and plays a significant role in biological processes such as adipogenesis and immune response.

Oral administration of this drug presents many drawbacks, resulting in treatment non-adherence among patients. Thus, the development of transdermal formulations for donepezil delivery is important. The aim of this study was to prepare and to evaluate nanostructured lipid carrier-based gels (NLC gel) able to improve the skin delivery of donepezil free base (DPB). The components of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were selected after evaluating their enhancing effects using in vitro DPB skin delivery assays. DPB-loaded NLC were prepared by a microemulsion technique, by employing stearic  as a solid lipid,  as a liquid lipid, lecithin as a surfactant, and sodium taurodeoxycholate as a co-surfactant. The DPB-NLC dispersions were characterized morphologically using atomic force microscopy and physicochemically using dynamic light scattering and surface charge measurements. These data along, with the encapsulation studies, indicated that uniformly nano-sized particles with high drug encapsulation were fabricated. In vitro skin permeation assays were performed, and the results indicated that drug skin permeation from DPB-NLC gel was increased, not only by the enhancing effect of their components, but the lipid nanocarriers also presented an additional enhancing effect to increase drug flux across the skin. Therefore, DPB-NLC gel is an interesting formulation for the enhanced treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Copyright © 2019.

Lenalidomide was covalently bound to FePt-NH by pH sensitive hydrazone bonding. Hyaluronic  was conjugated to amino groups of APTES while lactoferrin (Lf) was directly conjugated to excess carboxylic group present on hyaluronic  (HA) to form surface modified pH sensitive alloy-drug nanoconjugates (SPANs). The multifunctional nanoconjugates were characterized and evaluated using extensive in vitro and in vivo techniques. The nanoconjugates demonstrated excellent heating ability on exposure to alternating magnetic field and near-infrared laser irradiation. The acidic microenvironment of lysozome triggered release of LND from SPANs. Owing to leaching of Fe and Pt contents, SPANs demonstrated ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in U87MG cell line which further enhanced therapeutic effect of SPANs. Significant difference in cell viability suppression was observed in in vitro photothermal, chemo-photothermal and chemo-magnetophotothermal killing of cancer cells using SPANs in U87MG cell lines. Significant difference in heating ability and cell cytotoxicity of SPANs in comparison to alternative magnetic field and NIR irradiation was observed for DUAL-mode exposure of SPANs. The results of cellular internalization study showed efficient internalization of SPANs inside U87MG cells.

Bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD by regulating the level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1c, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Increased evidence indicates that the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway is a key pathway to regulate hepatic cellular lipid . UDCA may regulate the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway to ameliorate hepatic lipid .To investigate the functional mechanism of UDCA in an  (OA)-induced cellular model of NAFLD.The cellular model of NAFLD was established using OA and treated with UDCA. First, the best concentration of UDCA was selected. For the best time-dependent assay, cells were stimulated with OA only or co-treated with OA and 2 mmol/L UDCA for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Oil red O staining was used to observe the accumulation of intracellular lipids, while the intracellular contents of triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were detected by enzymatic methods. Meanwhile, the expression levels of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot.In the NAFLD cell model established with LO2 cells induced using OA, lipid accumulation was obvious. UDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation at different concentrations (especially 2 mmol/L) and decreased cell growth ability at different time points. The biochemical parameters like ALT, AST, and GGT were significant improved by UDCA. UDCA treatment vividly repressed the activation of AKT, mTOR, and CRTC2 and the expression of nSREBP-1 in LO2 cells induced with OA.Our findings demonstrate the effect of UDCA in improving NAFLD.

It plays an important role in protein synthesis and carbohydrate and lipid . Chromium is found in trivalent Cr(III) and hexavalent Cr(VI) form; Cr(III) is relatively stable and intimately participates with many phenomena of metabolisms. Whereas, Cr(VI) is toxic, which results in growth inhibition and leading to changes in components of antioxidant systems as well as secondary metabolites. However, the molecular mechanism that is involved in Cr (VI)-induced hepatotoxicity is still unclear. For this purpose, 40 chickens were randomly assigned into two groups: the normal group (feeding the basic diet and clear water), the chromium group (16%LD, 74.24 mg/kg/day KCrO ). The samples were subjected to pathological examination and UHPLC-QE-MS non-target metabolomics method for metabolomics analysis of broiler liver using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The central venous cells of the broiler liver in the chromium poisoning group showed turbidity and flaky necrosis, nuclear condensation, nuclear rupture, and even nuclear dissolution. The differential metabolite analysis between the chromium poisoning and the control group showed that 32 differential metabolites were upregulated and 15 were downregulated in positive ion mode. Whereas,17 differential metabolites were downregulated, and 35 were downregulated in negative ion mode (P ≤ 0.05). The potential marker substances are  acidamide, farnesylacetone, betaine, taurine, choline, and galactinol. Additionally, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)  showed that the lipid , carbohydrate , nucleotide , amino  , energy , membrane transport, digestive system, and nervous system were the most important   in the liver.

Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure. In this study, APAP (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) were employed on mice fed with a high-fat diet, and APAP (2, 4, 8 mM) were cultured with L02 cells in the presence of alcohol and . APAP treatment significantly aggravated hepatic lipid accumulation, increased the serum levels of triglyceride (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and increased hepatic lipid accumulation in H&E and Oil red O staining results. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) found fewer number of autophagosomes in APAP (100 mg/kg) treated group. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the intensity of hepatic mTOR was increased and AMPK was decreased in 200 mg/kg APAP treated group. Western blot analysis showed APAP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin1 and AMPK, while increased the levels of mTOR and SREBP-1c, respectively. In vitro study showed APAP treatment obviously increased TG activities in cell supernatant, and Oil red O staining had the same results. Western blot analysis demonstrated APAP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin1 and AMPK, increased the levels of mTOR and SREBP-1c, but rapamycin treatment significantly reversed these effects of APAP. In conclusion, therapeutic dosages of APAP aggravates fat accumulation in NAFLD, the potential mechanism might be involved in inhibiting autophagy associated with the AMPK/mTOR pathway, and patients with NAFLD should use a lower dose of APAP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Coconut oil and its derivatives have been widely used in various industries. In this paper, a type 2 diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT2), which is one of the key enzymes involved in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, was first characterized in coconut pulp (endosperm). The results indicated that CoDGAT2 was highly expressed in coconut pulp approximately 7 months after pollination. The heterologous expression of CoDGAT2 in the mutant yeast H1246 restored TAG biosynthesis in the yeast, which exhibited substrate preference for two unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), palmitoleic  (C16:1) and  (C18:1). Moreover, the seed-specific overexpression of CoDGAT2 in Arabidopsis thaliana led to a significant increase in the linoleic  (C18:2) content (approximately 6%) compared with that in the wild type.

However, its potential to cause toxicity remains unclear. To examine the potential toxicity and associated mechanism, elemicin was administered to mice for 3 weeks and serum metabolites were examined. Enlarged livers were observed in elemicin-treated mice, which were accompanied by lower ratios of unsaturated- and saturated-lysophosphatidylcholines in plasma, and inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 () mRNA expression in liver. Administration of the unsaturated fatty   reduced the toxicity of 1'-hydroxylelemicin, the primary oxidative metabolite of elemicin, while treatment with the SCD1 inhibitor A939572 potentiated its toxicity. Furthermore, the in vitro use of recombinant human CYPs and chemical inhibition of CYPs in human liver microsomes revealed that CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 were the primary CYPs responsible for elemicin bioactivation. Notably, the CYP1A2 inhibitor α-naphthoflavone could attenuate the susceptibility of mice to elemicin-induced hepatomegaly. This study revealed that  activation of elemicin leads to SCD1 inhibition in liver, suggesting that upregulation of SCD1 may serve as potential intervention strategy for elemicin-induced toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772307>Nitro-fatty acids protect against steatosis and fibrosis during development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and resulting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are reaching global epidemic proportions. Lack of non-invasive diagnostic tools and effective therapies constitute two of the major hurdles for a bona fide treatment and a reversal of NASH progression and/or regression of the disease. Nitro- (OA-NO) has been proven effective in multiple experimental models of inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, the potential benefit of in vivo administration of OA-NO to treat advanced NAFLD was tested herein in a model of long-term NASH diet-induced liver damage.Non-invasive imaging (e.g. photoacustic-ultrasound (PA-US)) was pursued to establish advanced experimental model of NASH in mice in which both steatosis and fibrosis were diagnosed prior experimental therapy with OA-NO. Experimental controls included equimolar amounts of the non-nitrated  (OA). CLAMS and NMR-based analysis was used for energy .CLAMS and NMR-based analysis demonstrates that OA-NO improves body composition and energy  and inhibits hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Photoacoustic-ultrasound imaging revealed a robust inhibition of liver steatosis and fibrosis by OA-NO. RNA-sequencing analysis uncovered inflammation and fibrosis as major  suppressed by OA-NO administration, as well as regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis , with a robust inhibition of SREBP1 proteolytic activation and subsequent lipogenesis gene expression by OA-NO. These results were further supported by histological analysis and quantification of lipid accumulation, lobular inflammation (F4/80 staining) and fibrosis (collagen deposition, αSMA staining) as well as established parameters of liver damage (ALT). In vitro studies indicate that OA-NO inhibits TG biosynthesis and accumulation in hepatocytes and inhibits fibrogenesis in human stellate cells.OA-NO improve steatohepatitis and fibrosis and may constitute an effective therapeutic approach against advanced NAFLD that warrants further clinical evaluation.Copyright © 2019.

The results showed that, besides concentration, UFAs types could also influence fermentation process and volatiles in final wine. Low concentrations of UFAs (12 and 60 mg/L), especially LA and OA, significantly promoted fermentation activity and most volatiles when compared to the control, however, the effect became the inhibition with increasing concentrations of UFAs (120 and 240 mg/L). It was interesting to find that OA addition (12 and 60 mg/L) could generate more acetate esters (especially isoamyl acetate) in wine, while 12 mg/L LA facilitated more fatty acids formation (octanoic  and decanoic ). In comparison, 120 and 240 mg/L ALA produced more amount of C6 alcohols (1-hexanol) and higher alcohols (isobutyl alcohol and 2,3-butanediol). UFAs additions were unfavorable for ethyl esters formation, except for an increment of ethyl hexanoate in 12 mg/L OA wine. As a result, different aromatic profiles of wines were generated by variations of UFAs types and levels, as shown by PCA. The transcriptional data revealed that the expressions of aroma-related genes, such as , , , , , , , ,  and  were correlated with aroma compounds productions in different treatments. Our data suggested that the three UFAs have different enological functions and they could generate different aromatic profiles. Thus, besides concentrations, it is essential to consider the types of UFAs when applying the strategy to adjust UFAs contents to modulate the aromatic quality of wines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161037>Dynamic changes of postprandial plasma metabolites after intake of corn-soybean meal or casein-starch diets in growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Postprandial nutrients utilization and  of a certain diet is a complicated process. The  feature of pigs after intake of corn-soybean meal or casein-starch diets are largely unknown. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the dynamic postprandial changes of plasma  profile using growing pigs using metabolomics.Twenty-four growing pigs with average initial body weight (BW) about 30 kg were placed in  cages and then fitted with precaval vein catheters. Pigs were fed daily 4% of initial body weight. Two experimental diets were included: (i) a starch-casein based purified diet (PD) and (ii) a common corn-soybean meal diet (CD). Plasma was collected before feeding and 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h after feeding.In both diets, compared to prior to feeding, the concentrations of glucose, most amino acids, metabolites such as 5-aminopentanoic , pipecolic , ornithine and 5-hydroxy--tryptophan were significantly increased in plasma during the first hour, whereas the concentrations of plasma triglycerides, glutamate, glycine, palmitelaidic , 13-HODE and  were decreased in the first hour. Compared with PD group, concentration of plasma leucine and isoleucine declined at 30 min in CD group. Plasma linoleic , sphingosine and many dipeptides were significantly higher in pigs fed CD.Most significant  changes occurred during the first hour after feeding and then became relatively stable after 2 h in both diets. These results show a broad scope picture of postprandial changes in plasma metabolites after intake of PD and CD and could be a reference for further nutrition intervention as well as the design of nutritional studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30842391>New Insights of Uterine Leiomyoma Pathogenesis: Endocannabinoid System.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to determine if components of the endocannabinoid system are modulated in uterine leiomyomas (fibroids). Components studied included cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1) and 2 (CB2); the G protein-coupled receptor GPR55; transient potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) and the endocannabinoid modulating enzymes N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) and fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), and their N-acylethanolamine (NAE) ligands: N-arachidonylethanolamine (AEA), N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA), and N-palmityolethanaolamine (PEA). MATERIAL AND METHODS Transcript levels of CB1, CB2, TRPV1, GPR55, NAPE-PLD, and FAAH were measured using RT-PCR and correlated with the tissue levels of the 3 NAEs in myometrial tissues. The tissues studied were: 1) fibroids, 2) myometrium adjacent/juxtaposed to the fibroid lesions, and 3) normal myometrium. Thirty-seven samples were processed for NAE measurements and 28 samples were used for RT-PCR analyses. RESULTS FAAH expression was significantly lower in fibroids, resulting in a NAPE-PLD: FAAH ratio that favors higher AEA levels in pre-menopausal tissues, whilst PEA levels were significantly lower, particularly in post-menopausal women, suggesting PEA protects against fibroid pathogenesis. The CB1: CB2 ratio was lower in fibroids, suggesting that loss of CB1 expression affects the fibroid cell phenotype. Significant correlations between reduced FAAH, CB1, and GPR55 expression and PEA in fibroids indicate that the loss of these endocannabinoid system components are biomarkers of leiomyomata. CONCLUSIONS Loss of expression of CB1, FAAH, GPR55, and PEA production are linked to the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids and further understanding of this might eventually lead to better disease indicators or the development of therapeutic potentials that might eventually be used in the management of uterine fibroids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31342722>[Screening of serum susceptibility biomarkers in patients with mild liver function abnormalities based on non-targeted metabolomics].</a></h2><p>In the present study,non-targeted metabolomics technique was used to screen potentially susceptibility biomarkers in patients with mild liver function abnormalities during long-term use of Chinese herbal compound.

In this work, cDNA microarray technology was applied to analyze the transcriptional discrepancies of wine yeast (commercial wine yeast Lalvin EC1118) fermenting in synthetic grape must supplemented with different concentrations of a mixture of UFAs (including linoleic , , and α-linolenic ). The results showed that the initial addition of a high level of UFAs can significantly enrich the intracellular UFAs when compared to a low addition of UFAs and further increase the cell population and most volatiles, including higher alcohols and esters, except for several fatty acids. Microarray analyses identified that 63 genes were upregulated, and 91 genes were downregulated during the different fermentation stages. The up-regulated genes were involved in yeast growth and proliferation, stress responses and amino  transportation, while the repressed genes were associated with lipid and sterol biosynthesis, amino  , TCA cycle regulation, mitochondrial respiration, and stress responses. Unexpectedly, the genes directly related to the biosynthesis of volatile compounds did not vary substantially between the fermentations with the high and low UFA additions. The beneficial aromatic function of the UFAs was ascribed to the increased biomass and amino  transportation, considering that the incorporation of the additional UFAs in yeast cells maintains high membrane fluidity and increases the ability of the cells to resist deleterious conditions. Our results highlighted the importance of UFAs in the regulation of aroma biosynthesis during wine fermentation and suggested that the improvement of the resistance of yeast to extreme stresses during alcoholic fermentation is essential to effectively modulate and improve the production of aroma compounds. A potential way to achieve this goal could be the rational increase of the UFA contents in grape must.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214798>Mucoadhesive In Situ Gelling Liquid Crystalline Precursor System to Improve the Vaginal Administration of Drugs.</a></h2><p>The vaginal mucosa is a very promising route for drug administration due to its high permeability and the possibility to bypass first pass ; however, current vaginal dosage forms present low retention times due to their dilution in vaginal fluids, which hampers the efficacy of many pharmacological treatments. In order to overcome these problems, this study proposes to develop a mucoadhesive in situ gelling liquid crystalline precursor system composed of 30% of  and cholesterol (7:1), 40% of ethoxylated and propoxylated cetyl alcohol, and 30% of a dispersion of 16% Poloxamer 407. The effect of the dilution with simulated vaginal fluid (SVF) on this system was evaluated by polarized light microscopy (PLM), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), rheological studies, texture profile analysis (TPA), mucoadhesion study, in vitro drug release test using hypericin (HYP) as drug model, and cytotoxicity assay. PLM and SAXS confirmed the formation of an isotropic system. After the addition of three different concentrations of SVF (30, 50, and 100%), the resultant formulations presented anisotropy and characteristics of viscous lamellar phases. Rheology shows that formulations with SVF behaved as a non-Newtonian fluid with suitable shear thinning for vaginal application. TPA and mucoadhesion assays indicated the formation of long-range ordered systems as the amount of SVF increases which may assist in the fixation of the formulation on the vaginal mucosa. The formulations were able to control about 75% of the released HYP demonstrating a sustained release profile. Finally, all formulations acted as safe vaginal drug delivery systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977920>Untargeted Metabolite Profiling of Adipose Tissue in Hyperlipidemia Rats Exposed to Hawthorn Ethanol Extracts.</a></h2><p>The study aimed to explore the  changes of adipose tissue of hyperlipidemia rats with hawthorn ethanol extracts (HEE) consumption by a high-throughput metabolomics approach. HEE were mainly composed of chlorogenic , hyperoside, isoquercitrin, rutin, vitexin, quercetin, and apigenin by HPLC analysis. HEE administration significantly lowered levels of the total cholesterols, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as compared to the high-fat diet model. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify adipose metabolite profiles. Numerous endogenous molecules were altered by high-fat diet and restored following intervention of HEE. Metabolites elevated in adipose, including l-threonine, aspartic , glutamine, mannose, inositol and , were detected after HEE consumption. Fifteen metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers of hyperlipidemia. Pathway analysis showed that most of the discriminant metabolites were included in fatty  biosynthesis, galactose , biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, arginine and proline , alanine, aspartate and glutamate , glycerolipid  and steroid biosynthesis. These metabolites and   we found offer new insights into exploring the molecular mechanisms of lipid-lowering of hawthorn ethanol extracts on adipose tissue of rats.

Palmitic , a predominant lipid derivative, can cause lipoapoptosis and the release of inflammatory extracellular vesicles (EVs) in hepatocytes, but the effect of lipids on EV production in chronic kidney disease remains vaguely explored. This study was aimed to investigate whether palmitic  would stimulate EV release from renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Human and rat proximal tubular epithelial cells, HK-2 and NRK-52E, were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), BSA-conjugated palmitic  (PA), and BSA-conjugated  (OA) for 24-48 h. The EVs released into conditioned media were isolated by ultracentrifugation and quantified by nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA). According to NTA, the size distribution of EVs was 30-150 nm with similar mode sizes in all experimental groups. Moreover, BSA-induced EV release was significantly enhanced in the presence of PA, whereas EV release was not altered by the addition of OA. In NRK-52E cells, PA-enhanced EV release was associated with an induction of cell apoptosis reflected by an increase in cleaved caspase-3 protein by Western blot and Annexin V positive cells analyzed by flow cytometry. Additionally, confocal microscopy confirmed the uptake of lipid-induced EVs by recipient renal proximal tubular cells. Collectively, our results indicate that PA stimulates EV release from cultured proximal tubular epithelial cells. Thus, extended characterization of lipid-induced EVs may constitute new signaling paradigms contributing to chronic kidney disease pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187404>Functional expression of the free fatty acids receptor-1 and -4 (FFA1/GPR40 and FFA4/GPR120) in bovine endometrial cells.</a></h2><p>Endometrial epithelial cells play a key defensive role as part of the innate immune response of cow uterus. An association between risk of acquiring infectious diseases and increased levels of free fatty acids postpartum has been suggested, and the use of omega-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic  (DHA) has been proposed as a beneficial strategy to improve immunity and fertility. The goal of our study was to demonstrate the presence of free fatty  (FFA)-1 and 4 receptors in endometrial cells and to investigate their role on DHA interference in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory endometrial activation. We demonstrated that the bovine endometrial (BEND) cells line and bovine endometrium express both FFA1 and FFA4 receptors. FFA1 and FFA4 receptors were localized in the epithelium lining the endometrial cavity and in endometrial glands whereas in BEND cells a characteristic cell membrane localization of both receptors was observed. DHA, a FFA4 natural agonist, increased intracellular calcium mobilization in BEND cells, but the FFA1 agonists  and linoleic acids did not increase this response. DHA-induced intracellular calcium mobilization was inhibited by the FFA4 and FFA1 antagonists AH7614 and GW1100, respectively. DHA significantly reduced LPS-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, but none of the antagonists reduced the effect produced by DHA. On the contrary, linoleic  increased LPS-induced PGE2 production. In conclusion, endometrial cells express FFA4 and FFA1 receptors, and DHA induces intracellular calcium release via FFA4 and FFA1 receptors. DHA reduces PGE2, but this response was not mediated by FFA4 or FFA1 receptors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959940>Comparison of Fatty  Profiles in a Group of Female Patients with Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD) and  Syndrome (MetS)⁻Similar Trends of Changes, Different Pathophysiology.</a></h2><p>Fatty  (FA) profiles in the plasma of patients with  syndrome and chronic kidney disease (CKD) seem to be identical despite their different etiology (dietary mistakes vs. cachexia). The aim of this study was to compare both profiles and to highlight the differences that could influence the improvement of the treatment of patients in both groups. The study involved 73 women, including 24 patients with chronic kidney disease treated with haemodialysis, 19 patients with  syndrome (MetS), and 30 healthy women in the control group. A total of 35 fatty acids and derivatives were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. Intensified elongation processes from  C10:0 to C16:0 were noted in both groups (more intense in MetS), as well as an increased synthesis of arachidonic  (C20:4n6), which was more intense in CKD. Significant correlations of  (C18:1n9), gamma linoleic  (C18:3n6), and docosatetraenoate  (C22:4n6) with parameters of CKD patients were observed. In the MetS group, auxiliary   of  were activated, which simultaneously inhibited the synthesis of eicosapentanoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) from alpha lipoic  (ALA). On the other hand, in the group of female patients with CKD, the synthesis of EPA and DHA was intensified. Activation of the synthesis of  (C18: 1n9 ct) and trans-vaccinic  (C18:1) is a protective mechanism in kidney diseases and especially in MetS due to the increased concentration of saturated fatty  (SFA) in plasma. The cause of the increased amount of all FAs in plasma in the CKD group, especially in the case of palmitic (C16:0) and derivatives stearic (C18:0) acids, may be the decomposition of adipose tissue and the progressing devastation of the organism, whereas, in the MetS group, dietary intake seems to be the main reason for the increase in SFA. Moreover, in MetS, auxiliary   are activated for , which cause the simultaneous inhibition of EPA and DHA synthesis from ALA, whereas, in the CKD group, we observe an increased synthesis of EPA and DHA. The higher increase of nervonic  (C24:1) in CKD suggests a higher degree of demyelination and loss of axons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927246>Sodium Orthovanadate Changes Fatty  Composition and Increased Expression of Stearoyl-Coenzyme A Desaturase in THP-1 Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Vanadium compounds are promising antidiabetic agents. In addition to regulating glucose , they also alter lipid . Due to the clear association between diabetes and atherosclerosis, the purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of sodium orthovanadate on the amount of individual fatty acids and the expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD or Δ-desaturase), Δ-desaturase, and Δ-desaturase in macrophages. THP-1 macrophages differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were incubated in vitro for 48 h with 1 μM or 10 μM sodium orthovanadate (NaVO). The estimation of fatty  composition was performed by gas chromatography. Expressions of the genes SCD, fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1), and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) were tested by qRT-PCR. Sodium orthovanadate in THP-1 macrophages increased the amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) such as palmitic  and stearic , as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)- and palmitoleic . Sodium orthovanadate caused an upregulation of SCD expression. Sodium orthovanadate at the given concentrations did not affect the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic , arachidonic , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). In conclusion, sodium orthovanadate changed SFA and MUFA composition in THP-1 macrophages and increased expression of SCD. Sodium orthovanadate did not affect the amount of any PUFA. This was associated with a lack of influence on the expression of FADS1 and FADS2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408589>[Lipolysis in very low density lipoproteins - locus minoris resistentiae - in the pathogenesis of hypertriglyceridemia.

Palmitic and  VLDL (>80% total VLDL) are not converted in low density lipoproteins (LDL). Atherosclerosis is not an alimentary deficiency of polyenic fatty acids (PFA), but results from low in vivo bioavailability of PFA in LDL against the background of high dietary palmitic FA and palmitic LDL. Plasma PFA content and cellular PFA deficiency are as high as LDL cholesterol (CL). Primary prevention of atherosclerosis should be based on a decrease in dietary content of palmitic saturated FA, trans FA and a moderate increase in PFA. It seems highly unlikely that the xeobiotics statins, fibrates and probucol produce pleiotropic biological effects in vivo. These effects are brought about by phylogenetically early humoral mediators eicosanoids: prostacyclins, prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and resolvins. It is reasonable to suggest that all preparations which act according to the same algorithm activate TG hydrolysis in VLDL and normalize cellular uptake of PFA in linoleic and linolenic LDL via apoВ-100 endocytosis.

Fatty  desaturase 2 (FAD2) catalyzes  (OA) into linoleic  (LA) transformations, which are essential to the profile of FAs in seeds. To further understand the roles of FAD2s in the synthesis of oil, the evolution and biocatalysis of FAD2s were comprehensively analyzed. The evolution history of the  gene family showed that most of the  genes formed monophyletic clades except in eudicots. The  genes in some eudicots diverged into constitutive and seed-specific expression clades. Notably, the biocatalysis of seed-specific or -abundant expression s in soybean, perilla, rice, and spruce revealed that their catalytic activity was strongly correlated with the total oil content of their seeds in nature. Additionally, it was found that I and Y in site 143 of GmaFAD2-1 were strictly conserved in the seed-specific and constitutive expression clades of Fabaceae, respectively. Furthermore, the site-directed mutation demonstrated that I and Y are vital to improving and reducing the activity of GmaFAD2s. Therefore, the results indicate that the activity of FAD2s in seeds might be a reference to the total oil content of seeds, and site 143 might have been specifically evolved to be required for the activity of FAD2s in some expression-diverged eudicots, especially in legumes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497874>Delayed intervention with a novel SGLT2 inhibitor NGI001 suppresses diet-induced  dysfunction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is closely related to  diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated  disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated  symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose  and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty  synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in -treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced  diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

The selectivity of linolenic  and linoleic  is as high as 5.75 and 11.4, respectively; the iodine value (IV) of soybean oil after hydrogenation is 102 g I/100g and the trans fatty acids(TFAs) content is only 1.7%. The use efficiency of the catalyst decreased to 60% after 8 cycles. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation has important research significance and application prospects for the preparation of low-trans hydrogenated oils and fats. This method also provides a theoretical basis for the development of the oil hydrogenation industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108757>Effect of co-culture with Tetragenococcus halophilus on the physiological characterization and transcription profiling of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii.</a></h2><p>Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Tetragenococcus halophilus are widely existed and play vital roles during the manufacture of fermented foods such as soy sauce. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of T. halophilus CGMCC 3792 on the physiological characterizations and transcription profiling of Z. rouxii CGMCC 3791. Salt tolerance analysis revealed that co-culture with T. halophilus enhanced the salt tolerance of Z. rouxii during salt stress. Analysis of the volatile compounds revealed that co-culture reduced the level of 1-butanol, improved the level of octanoic  which all were produced by T. halophilus and reduced the level of phenylethyl alcohol produced by Z. rouxii. The presence of Z. rouxii decreased the contents of 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde and acetic  produced by T. halophilus. In addition, co-culture improved the content of benzyl alcohol significantly. Analysis of membrane fatty  showed that co-culture improved the content of palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids in cells of Z. rouxii, and reduced the contents of myristic (C14:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1) and  (C18:1). In order to further explore the interactions between the two strains, RNA-seq technology was used to investigate the effect of co-culture with T. halophilus on the transcription profiling of Z. rouxii. By comparing cells incubated in co-culture group with cells incubated in single-culture group, a total of 967 genes were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among the DEGs, 72 genes were up-regulated, while 895 genes were down-regulated. These DEGs took party in various activities in cells of Z. rouxii, and the result showed co-culture with T. halophilus had a positive effect on proteolysis, the attachment of a cell to another cell, extracellular protein accumulation, energy , and a negative effect on oxidative phosphorylation, small molecular substances , DNA replication and repair, and transcription in cells of Z. rouxii. Results presented in this study may contribute to further understand the interactions between Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Tetragenococcus halophilus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of palmitic fatty  (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of palmitic triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes palmitic TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce  nonesterified FA de novo. Energy substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral fat cells. In insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with palmitic type of FA  into herbivorous dry land-living species with  type  of FA. The IR syndrome can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and b) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species. Concerning death rate, cardiovascular pathologies are dominating in populations of many countries, while feeding function disorders prevail in frequency. These disorders form the pathophysiological basis for all  pandemias: 1) atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, 2) essential arterial hypertension, 3)  syndrome, 4) obesity, 5) insulin resistance syndrome, 6) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and 7) endogenous hyperuricemia. Persistent potential deficiency of energy for realization of all biological reactions and functions is the major  disorders in diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance is a pathology associated primarily with FA and secondarily with glucose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30857274>Synthesis and In Vitro Evaluation of Caffeoylquinic  Derivatives as Potential Hypolipidemic Agents.</a></h2><p>A series of novel caffeoylquinic  derivatives of chlorogenic  have been designed and synthesized.

Study included 20 patients (64-86 years) with femoral neck fractures, indicated for surgery, and control group of 17 elderly subjects, without fractures or serious chronic diseases. Plasma was obtained during the first 12 hours postfracture and presurgery, and 7 days postop. Compared to control, patients had significantly higher saturated FA (SFA) and monounsaturated FA, as well as increased TNF-α and IL-6. In opposite, levels of individual and total n-6 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), individual and total n-3 PUFA, n-6/n-3 ratio and levels of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) were markedly lower in the patient than controls. On the 7th day after the surgery we showed a further rise in the SFA,  and TNF-α, and reductions of n-6 PUFA and IL-6. Taken together our results suggest that altered FA status, especially reduced PUFA, may influence hip fracture repair and even contribute to femoral fractures susceptibility in the elderly. Potential benefit from nutritional intervention with PUFA in prevention and/or fracture healing should be considered.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832407>Dietary Polyphenols Protect Against -Induced Steatosis in an in Vitro Model of NAFLD by Modulating Lipid  and Improving Mitochondrial Function.</a></h2><p>In this study, we aimed to determine the relative effectiveness of common dietary polyphenols or the isoquinoline alkaloid berberine in protecting against molecular mechanisms underlying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) involving changes to cellular lipid  and bioenergetics. In a model of steatosis using HepG2 hepatocytes, exposure of the cells to 1.5 mM  (OA) for 24 h caused steatosis and distorted cell morphology, induced the expression of mRNA for enzymes that are involved in lipogenesis and fatty  oxidation ( and ), and impaired indices of aerobic energy  ( mRNA expression, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and galactose-supported ATP production). Co-treatment with 10 µM of selected polyphenols all strongly protected against the steatosis and changes in cell morphology. All polyphenols, except cyanidin, inhibited the effects on  and  and further increased  expression, suggesting a shift toward increased β-oxidation. Resveratrol, quercetin, catechin, and cyanidin, however not kuromanin or berberine, ameliorated the decreases in MMP and galactose-derived ATP. Berberine was unique in worsening the decrease in galactose-derived ATP. In further investigations of the mechanisms involved, resveratrol, catechin, and berberine increased SIRT1 enzyme activity and p-AMPKα protein, which are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.

However, their consistency in heterogeneous soil and diverse ecological settings is unclear. The current study presents in vitro and field evaluation of pre-characterized PGPR strain Enterobacter sp. Fs-11 (GenBank accession # GQ179978) in terms of its potential to enhance sunflower yield and oil contents under diverse environmental conditions. Under in vitro conditions, strain Fs-11 showed optimal growth at a range of temperature (15 to 40 °C) and pH values (6.5 to 8.5). Extracellular and intracellular localizations of the strain Fs-11 in sunflower root cortical cells through transmission electron microscopy confirmed its epiphytic and endophytic colonization patterns, respectively. In field experiments, conducted at three different agro-climatic locations, inoculation of strain Fs-11 at 50% reduced NP fertilizer resulted in a significant increase in growth, achene yield, nutrient uptake, and oil contents. Inoculation also responded significantly in terms of increase in mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids ( and linoleic acids, respectively) without rising saturated fatty  (palmitic and stearic acids) contents.

Olaminosomes were prepared using , oleylamine and sorbitan monooleate adopting thin film hydration technique. Chitosan HCl was added to impart the mucoadhesive properties to the olaminosomes. Mucoadhesive olaminosomes were characterized for their particle size, in-vitro drug release and irritation potentiality in rabbit eyes. The reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) through 8 h in male New Zealand Albino rabbits was measured after administration of the selected formulations. Histopathological changes in rabbits' eye were also evaluated. Results revealed that increasing the amount of the added oleylamine decreased the particle size of the resulted vesicles and increased the drug release rate. Olaminosomes showed enhanced drug absorption, hence more reduction in IOP was observed. Moreover, using chitosan HCl might increase the residence time of the formulation in the eye and hence improved the absorption of the drug. No histopathological changes in rabbits' eye were detected after the application of mucoadhesive olaminosomes concluding their safety on the ocular tissues. In conclusion, mucoadhesive olaminosomes succeeded in enhancing agomelatine bioavailability in rabbits' eyes confirming the development of a novel ocular nanocarrier for insoluble drugs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, under phosphorous (P) deprivation, the production of the monounsaturated  prevails. We compared physiological responses, ultrastructural, and  consequences of L. incisa acclimation to N and P deficiency to provide novel insights into the key determinants of ARA accumulation. Differential responses to nutrient deprivation on growth performance, carbon-to-nitrogen stoichiometry, membrane lipid composition and TAG accumulation were demonstrated. Ultrastructural analyses suggested a dynamic role for vacuoles in sustaining cell homeostasis under conditions of different nutrient availability and their involvement in autophagy in L. incisa. Paralleling ARA-rich TAG accumulation in lipid droplets, N deprivation triggered intensive chloroplast dismantling and promoted catabolic processes. Metabolome analysis revealed depletion of amino acids and pyrimidines, and repression of numerous biosynthetic hubs to favour TAG biosynthesis under N deprivation. Under P deprivation, despite the relatively low growth penalties, the presence of the endogenous P reserves and the characteristic lipid remodelling,  signatures of energy deficiency were revealed. Metabolome adjustments to P deprivation included depletion in ATP and phosphorylated nucleotides, increased levels of TCA-cycle intermediates and osmoprotectants. We conclude that characteristic cellular and metabolome adjustments tailor the adaptive responses of L. incisa to N and P deprivation modulating its LC-PUFA production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The duration of contact of formulations with the vaginal mucosa is critical for therapeutic efficacy. This study describes the development of organogels employing an oil phase composed of  (OA) and an aqueous phase consisting of the poloxamer PL, alone or in association with PL, together with 0.25-1% sodium alginate (SA), in order to obtain an intravaginal drug delivery system capable of modulating the release of voriconazole (VRC). VRC was solubilized in  homogenized with the PL-SA aqueous phase, at a final concentration of 5 mg/mL. Physicochemical characterization was performed for evaluation of the influence of SA on organogel structural organization, biopharmaceutical properties, pharmacological efficacy, and cytotoxicity, envisaging use of the formulation for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis. The enthalpy variation values showed greater changes in the presence of PL and after the incorporation of SA or VRC in the organogels. Rheological analysis showed T values in the ranges 11-39 °C and 27-30 °C for the OA-PL and OA-PL formulations, respectively. Oscillatory analysis of OA-PL showed that G' was ~20-fold higher than G″, even after submitting the formulation to temperature variation. VRC-OA-PL showed fast drug release from 0.5 to 4 h, maintaining total release (~100%) up to 24 h. The incorporation of SA in the organogels enabled modulation of VRC release, with different release percentages for 0.25% SA (~75%), 0.5% SA (~55%), and 1% SA (~35%). The formulation was non-cytotoxic towards HeLa and Vero cell lines. In diffusion tests, it was able to prevent the growth of Candida albicans and Candida krusei. In conclusion, the results suggested that OA-PL-SA organogels could be possible new systems for VRC delivery, with potential for use in future vaginal applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study we envisage a novel concept for obesity therapy, devoted to the development of innovative lipid nanostructured formulas with improved gastric tolerability and enhanced specificity in adipose cells targeting. For this purpose, an anti-obesity herbal active from red pepper extract - Capsaicin (Cap) and an endogenous lipid regulator of appetite - oleoylethanolamide (OEA) or a structural analogue of OEA - Phenylalaninol oleamide (PAO), are simultaneously integrated within the same delivery system - nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) prepared with linseed oil that has anti-inflammatory and hypotriglyceridemic properties. The NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap presented mean diameters under 200 nm, size that allow an efficient uptake of actives by enterocytes and lead to an extended biological action of all actives - Cap, OEA/PAO and linolenic . NLC revealed a polidispersity index ranging from 0.16 to 0.22, which represents a narrow dispersion around mean size and suggests an adequate unimodal behavior. The two types of NLC co-loaded with Cap and OEA/PAO were both negatively charged, with zeta potentials of -42.8 mV and -58.5 mV that offered a guarantee for an excellent stability of NLC in time. Despite to the competition between the accommodations of both actives into the lipid core of nanocarriers, the entrapment efficiency exceeds 92% for OEA/PAO and is ranged between 71 and 82% for Cap. In the presence of NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap, ABTS inhibition proceeded in a Capsaicin concentration dependent manner and was dependent on the type of NLC formulation. A remarkable radical-scavenging activity against ABTS was determined for Cap and OEA based-NLC. The in vitro release demonstrated that NLC played an important role on the delay of Cap dissolution; the NLC have ensured a slow release of Cap, eg only 21% Cap was released after 24 h of in vitro experiments. The in vivo pharmacological evaluation has revealed that the NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap treatment resulted in a body weight decrease and improves the lipid and glucose profile, as compared to the obese mice batch. Obesity mice treated with NLC-OEA exhibited a weight loss of ~15% and ~10% weight loss for NLC-POA, after 10-days treatment. Administration of NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap to the Albino Swiss mice led to significant decrease of glucose level (e.g. 117.4 mg/dL for NLC-OEA-Cap treated mice versus 213.9 mg/dL for obese mice batch) and exhibited a desired decrease effect of triglyceride (e.g. 71.1 mg/dL for NLC-OEA-Cap versus 129.5, for obese batch). Moreover, the cholesterol values have been lowered to almost half from the value determined for the control batches. Overall, study highlights that using appropriate lipid mediators in association with an herbal anti-obesity active, both formulated into lipid nanocarriers, could enhance the therapeutic response in the obesity treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Due to the growing economic burden of NAFLD on public health, it has become an emergent target for clinical intervention. DUSP12 is a member of the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family, which plays important roles in brown adipocyte differentiation, microbial infection, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, the role of DUSP12 in NAFLD has yet to be clarified. Here, we reveal that DUSP12 protects against hepatic steatosis and inflammation in L02 cells after palmitic / treatment. We demonstrate that hepatocyte specific DUSP12-deficient mice exhibit high-fat diet (HFD)-induced and high-fat high-cholesterol diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and liver steatosis and decreased insulin sensitivity. Consistently, DUSP12 overexpression in hepatocyte could reduce HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation. At the molecular level, steatosis in the absence of DUSP12 was characterized by elevated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which mediates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hepatic . DUSP12 physically binds to ASK1, promotes its dephosphorylation, and inhibits its action on ASK1-related proteins, JUN N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in order to inhibit lipogenesis under high-fat conditions. Conclusion: DUSP12 acts as a positive regulator in hepatic steatosis and offers potential therapeutic opportunities for NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

Recent findings indicate that natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver is regulated, in part, by endogenous cannabinoids. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication which inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in hepatocytes and limits lipid storage in the liver through the inhibition of free fatty  formation via induction of activated protein kinase activity (AMPK). Both endocannabinoids and metformin may modulate hepatosteatosis; therefore, it was interesting to examine whether metformin may affect lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by acting on cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, in in vitro study. Hep3B cells were incubated with or without metformin (Met), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and  (OA). Cells without any of the examined substances served as negative control. Cells treated only with OA served as positive control. The quantity of intracellular lipids was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. Selective CB1R agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloromethylamide (ACEA), and CB2R agonist, AM1241 (2-iodo-5-nitrophenyl)-[1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-1 H-indol-3-yl]methanone, were also used to treat Hep3B cells. In some experiments, antagonist for CB1R, AM6545, or SR144528 as selective antagonist of CB2R were used. In the study, Met decreased lipid accumulation in cells treated with OA and inhibited CB1R agonist-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. The CB2R agonist-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was not inhibited by metformin. The results indicate that metformin may interact with endocannabinoid system in the liver by inhibiting CB1R agonist-stimulated fat accumulation in hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772411>Valorization of crude glycerol based on biological processes for accumulation of lipophilic compounds.</a></h2><p>Bacteria that are capable of accumulating lipids in their cells as storage compounds can also produce polyhydroxyalkanoates of high technological value, depending on the specific culture conditions. The objective of this study was to utilize crude glycerol from biodiesel (CGB) as a substrate, which is a major byproduct from biodiesel production, to produce lipophilic compounds. Bacillus megaterium INCQS 425 was cultivated and evaluated for the production of lipophilic compounds and the properties of these compounds were investigated. Cultivation of the bacteria in a medium with a C:N ratio of 0.60:1 favored the accumulation of lipids by (17.5%) comprising mainly palmitic  (13.08%), palmitoleic (39.48%), and especially  (37.02%), which imparts good characteristics to biodiesel. Meanwhile, cultivation of the bacteria in a medium with a C:N ratio of 4:1 favored the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) (3.31gL) mainly comprising medium and long chain PHA. Low crystallinity (<30%) and excellent thermal properties make them suitable for processes that demand high temperatures, such as extrusion. The lipids produced in the present study had satisfactory oxidative stability for the production of quality biodiesel. The polyhydroxyalkanoates produced in the study are of low cost and have promising thermal properties that justify its technological potential, thereby configuring highly competitive bioproducts.Copyright © 2019.

Obese pregnant women have dyslipidemia; however, whether obesity impacts placental lipid transport and  remains to be fully established. Palmitoleic  (POA), an FA with anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties, is synthesized from palmitic  (PA) catalyzed by stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity. We hypothesized that the uptake and incorporation of FAs and POA synthesis are reduced in primary human trophoblasts (PHTs) isolated from pregnancies complicated by maternal obesity. Villous cytotrophoblasts were isolated from 7 placentas of obese [body mass index (BMI) = 37.5 ± 1.9] and 12 normal (BMI = 23.6 ± 0.6) mothers. FA uptake and incorporation were assessed using uniformly labeled (U[C])-FA mixtures of PA,  (OA), linoleic , and docosahexaenoic . Cellular [C] FAs were quantified both in total cellular lipids and in lipid classes by GC-MS. Uptake and incorporation of [C] FAs in total cellular lipids were not different in PHTs isolated from obese mothers compared with normal mothers. Only the concentration of OA was increased in the triglyceride fraction ( < 0.05) if the mother was obese. We found an isotopic enrichment of POA after U[C]-PA treatment, demonstrating SCD activity in PHT cells. Labeled POA content and the POA:PA ratio were significantly lower in PHTs isolated from placentas of obese mothers compared with normal, healthy controls. Decreased syncytiotrophoblast POA synthesis may contribute to insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation in the mother, placenta, or fetus (or a combination of the 3) in pregnancies complicated by obesity.-Ferchaud-Roucher, V., Barner, K., Jansson, T., Powell, T.

The related- pathway mainly included amino   (Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan ; Valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis; Arginine and proline ; Glycine, serine and threonine ) and lipid  (linoleic  , glycerophospholipid ). The results show that TSD has a favorable therapeutic effect on AUB by adjusting the  disorders, which could provide dietary guidance for the clinic.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

But the high concentration of GSH inside tumor cells can neutralize the generated ROS during PDT, resulting in an insufficient therapeutic effect. To address this issue, we combined ICG-loaded nanoparticles with PEITC for potent PDT. ICG encapsulated in novel hydroxyethyl starch- conjugate (HES-OA) nanoparticles (∼50 nm) exhibited excellent stability and efficient singlet oxygen generation under laser irradiation, promoted cellular uptake, and enhanced tumor accumulation, whilst PEITC depleted intracellular GSH significantly. As a result, PDT based on ICG-loaded NPs combined with PEITC synergistically suppressed cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Potentiating ICG-loaded NPs with PEITC represents a novel and efficient strategy to enhance PDT efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30724257>Physicochemical characteristics of fat blend from hydrogenated coconut oil and acyl migrated palm mid-fraction.</a></h2><p>Palm mid-fraction (PMF), which has a high content of symmetric POP, was converted to asymmetric PPO (APMF) via acyl migration. After solvent fractionation, the liquid phase of acyl migrated PMF (APMF-L) was obtained and blended with hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO, 50:50, w/w) to produce a fat blend (namely, an alternative fat blend) which had reduced saturated fatty  content while having similar melting behavior to HCO. In an alternative fat blend, the major fatty acids were lauric (27.94), palmitic (26.93) and  (15.75 mol%) . The solid fat index was quite similar to that of HCO, especially at 28-44 °C. Nevertheless, an alternative fat blend had lower saturated fatty  content, by 18%, compared to HCO. The content of highly atherogenic myristic  was reduced by approximately 40%. The alternative fat blend in this study could be used as a raw material for non-dairy cream with low saturated fat content.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, even 3 days of HFD consumption has been linked to inflammation within the key homeostatic brain region, the hypothalamus.Mice were fed either a low-fat diet (LFD) or HFD containing 10% or 60% (Kcal) respectively from fat for 3 days. Mice were weighed, food intake measured and glucose tolerance calculated using intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT). Proteomic analysis was carried out to determine if hypothalamic proteins were changed by a HFD. The direct effects of dietary fatty acids on mitochondrial morphology and on one of the proteins most changed by a HFD, dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2) a microtubule-associated protein which regulates microtubule dynamics, were also tested in mHypoE-N42 (N42) neuronal cells challenged with palmitic  (PA) and  (OA).Mice on the HFD, as expected, showed increased adiposity and glucose intolerance. Hypothalamic proteomic analysis revealed changes in 104 spots after 3 days on HFD, which, when identified by LC/MS/MS, were found to represent 78 proteins mainly associated with cytoskeleton and synaptic plasticity, stress response, glucose  and mitochondrial function. Over half of the changed proteins have also been reported to be changed in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Also,in N42 neurons mitochondrial morphology and DRP-2 levels were altered by PA but not by OA.These results demonstrate that within 3 days, there is a relatively large effect of HFD on the hypothalamic proteome indicative of cellular stress, altered synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial function, but not inflammation. Changes in N42 cells show an effect of PA but not OA on DRP-2 and on mitochondrial morphology indicating that long-chain saturated fatty acids damage neuronal function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063536>Prepartum fatty  supplementation in sheep.

Effect of calcium salts with eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  in the maternal and finishing diet on lamb liver and adipose tissue during the lamb finishing period1.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) supplementation to ewes during late gestation on finishing lamb liver and adipose tissue fatty  (FA) profile and gene expression. Lambs born from ewes supplemented with Ca salts of EPA + DHA, or palm FA distillate (PFAD) high in palmitic and  at 0.39% DM during the last 50 d of gestation were used. Lambs were weaned at 61 d of age and adapted to a high concentrate diet for 1.5 mo. After adaptation, 74 lambs (28 pens) were blocked by sex and BW and used in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments using the factors of dam supplementation (DS) and lamb supplementation (LS) of Ca salts of EPA + DHA or PFAD at 1.48% DM. Lambs were slaughtered after 42 d and liver and adipose tissue collected for FA and gene expression analysis. Liver concentrations of EPA and DHA were greater (P < 0.01) with LS of EPA + DHA vs. PFAD during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, a lamb × dam interaction was observed for EPA (P = 0.02) and DHA (P = 0.04); LS of EPA + DHA increased EPA and DHA, but the increase was greatest in lambs born from ewes supplemented with PFAD. No lamb × dam treatment interactions were observed for gene expression in liver tissue (P > 0.10). Hepatic mRNA abundance of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; P = 0.01) was greater in lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes vs. lambs from PFAD ewes. mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (P < 0.01), fatty  synthase (P = 0.01), Δ5-desaturase (P < 0.01), and Δ6-desaturase (P < 0.01) were decreased in liver of EPA + DHA lambs. A significant lamb × dam diet interaction was observed for elongation of very long chain fatty  2 in adipose tissue (P = 0.01); lambs supplemented with the same FA as their dams had lower expression. Expression of HSL tended (P = 0.08) to be decreased in adipose of EPA + DHA lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes. The changes in mRNA expression suggest that lipogenesis decreased, and lipolysis increased in lamb liver with EPA + DHA vs. PFAD supplementation during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, changes suggest that lipogenesis decreased in lambs born from EPA + DHA supplemented dams and supplemented with EPA + DHA during the finishing period. In addition, these results suggest an interaction between supplementation of FA to dams during late gestation on lamb response of adipose tissue, but not liver, to FA supplementation during the finishing period.© The Author(s) 2019.

Daming capsule (DMC), a medicine for lowering blood lipids, is marketed in China; however, its mechanism is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which DMC reduces blood lipids.A rat model of hyperlipidaemia was established by feeding rats a high-fat diet (HFD), and the serum lipid levels were detected with an automatic biochemical analyser. DMC (162 mg/kg) and atorvastatin calcium (10 mg/kg) were orally administered to the hyperlipidaemic rats for 4 weeks. HFD feeding markedly induced increases in the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c); however, DMC treatment significantly decreased the levels of TC, TG, and LDL-c in rats serum. Meanwhile, the hepatic TC and TG levels, liver weight/body weight ratio, and body weight were significantly lower in the DMC-treated rats than in the HFD rats. Moreover, DMC significantly alleviated hepatomegaly, hepatic lipid deposition, and hepatic steatosis. The protein expression level of phospho-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) (Thr172) in HFD rat livers was lower than that in normal rat livers, whereas it increased in the liver of the DMC-treated rats; however, the protein expression level of total-AMPK in the liver was not different among the groups. The AMPK-activating effect of DMC was blocked by Compound C (a specific AMPK inhibitor) in HepG2 cells. Additionally, DMC considerably increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) protein expression and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) transcription and concentration in the liver. This effect of DMC was also inhibited by Compound C in HepG2 cells. DMC also promoted LDL receptor (LDLR) protein expression by activating AMPK. We further found that DMC reduced the levels of TC and TG in -treated HepG2 cells, and it restored the expression levels of p-AMPK, PPARα, LPL, and LDLR compared to the decreased levels observed in -treated HepG2 cells.DMC lowered lipids in serum and the liver by activating AMPK. On the one hand, the activation of AMPK enhanced PPARα expression and LPL transcription to lead to the hydrolysis of TG; on the other hand, it increased LDLR protein expression to promote lipid .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Increasing cardiac PA levels, resulted in shortened atrial action potential duration, and increased I density. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) prevented increases in I due to PA. Acute (≥1hr) exposure of atrial myocytes to exogenous PA (1 mM) increased the density of the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current I, while it was decreased with the unsaturated  (OA, 1 mM). Serine-threonine protein phosphatase-2 (PP2A) inhibition with cantharidin reversed the effect of OA on I.Our data provide evidence of a novel lipotoxic guinea pig model with signs of vulnerability to arrhythmias.

Lauric C12 LC is half the FA in coconut oil. Residents of southeast Asia with constant use of coconut oil, have a low level of diseases of the cardiovascular system in the population. With a regulatory intake with food C12:0 laurin FA formed moderate ketosis and neuroprotective effect. Unlike long-chain LC, medium-chain TG cells are not deposited either in visceral fat cells, or in insulin-dependent adipocytes. Medium-chain fatty acids rapidly oxidize mitochondria; the formation of acetyl-CoA cells is used to form ketone bodies, activating thermogenesis in orange and brown adipocytes. Experiments with animals and observations in the clinic showed that taking medium-chain TG with food is more physiological than long-chain oils. This significantly increases the level of cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins. Food enriched with medium chain TG is optimal for increasing the ketone content in blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid without limiting the carbohydrate content in food. The formation of excess ketone bodies by cells can be achieved by activating the  transformations of medium-chain FAs, without fasting and preserving carbohydrates in food. Coconut oil has a positive effect on the cardiovascular system, preventing the formation of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis.

The cultivation was carried out in a 1000 l open plate tank system, which provides biomass yields comparable to open pond systems, but with less area needed. Algal biomass and lipid content were measured repeatedly. We compared the two solvent systems n-hexane and hexane/isopropanol (HIP) for extraction efficiency of lipids and applied three different extraction methods Soxhlet, soaking, and soaking followed by Soxhlet (soak-Sox). The combination of the HIP solvent and the soak-Sox provided the highest lipid yield (15.8 ± 0.174). Volumetric biomass and lipid productivity were 0.201 g l day and 31.71 mg l day, respectively, whereas areal biomass and lipid productivity were 25.73 g m day and 4.066 g m day, respectively. The fatty  profile by means of gas chromatography resulted in seven fatty acids from C to C. The most abundant fatty  methyl esters (FAMES) were palmitic (C16:0),  (C18:1), and stearic (C18:0) acids. Lipid synthesis enhanced by optimizing the Kuhl growth medium with replacing nitrate by urea (50% N compared to the original recipe) increased salt content (10 g/l NaCl), ferrous sulfate (0.5 g/l), and sodium acetate addition (1 g/l).

In recent years, this oil has been subject to an increasing national and international demand. The present work aims at studying the effect of clones and age, year of harvest and geographical origin on Argan oil quality and chemical composition. The results indicate that age does not affect Argan oil quality and fatty acids content. However, clones had a significant effect on fatty acids and tocopherol levels. Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were highly influenced by the year of harvest and geographical origin, presumably due to climatic conditions. Unsaturated fatty acids varied from 78.28% to 81.77%. Depending on clones, total tocopherols varied from 687.40 mg/kg to 1068 mg/kg.

Like the plant vacuole or the mammalian lysosome, the yeast vacuole is the destination of biosynthetic trafficking  that transport the vacuolar enzymes required for its functions. Moreover, substrates destined for degradation, like extracellular endocytosed cargoes that are transported by endosomes/multivesicular bodies as well as intracellular substrates that are transported via different forms of autophagosomes, have the vacuole as destination. We found that non-selective bulk autophagy of cytosolic proteins as well as the selective autophagic degradation of peroxisomes (pexophagy) and ribosomes (ribophagy) was dependent on the armadillo repeat protein Vac8 in . Moreover, we showed that pexophagy and ribophagy depended on the palmitoylation of Vac8. In contrast, we described that Vac8 was not involved in the acidification of the vacuole nor in the targeting and maturation of certain biosynthetic cargoes, like the aspartyl-protease Pep4 (PrA) and the carboxy-peptidase Y (CPY), indicating a role of Vac8 in the uptake of selected cargoes. In addition, we found that the hallmark phenotype of the  strain, namely the characteristic appearance of fragmented and clustered vacuoles, depended on the growth conditions. This fusion defect observed in standard glucose medium can be complemented by the replacement with  or glycerol medium. This complementation of vacuolar morphology also partially restores the degradation of peroxisomes.

Mitochondrial changes in CL were measured through mass spectrometry.Our data indicated that OA(18:1) was the most efficient fatty  that incorporated into CL, forming symmetrical CL without fatty  elongation and desaturation. In addition, LA(18:2) and ALA(18:3) were further elongated before incorporation, significantly increasing the number of double bonds and the chain length of CL. GLA and SDA were not optimal substrates for remodeling enzymes. The findings of RT-qPCR experiments revealed that none of these changes in CL occurred through the regulation of CL remodeling- or synthesis-related genes. The fatty  desaturase and transportation genes-Fads2 and Cpt1a, respectively-were differentially regulated by the supplementation of five unsaturated 18-carbon fatty acids.The process of fatty  incorporation to CL was regulated by the fatty  desaturation and transportation into mitochondria in macrophage. The double bonds of fatty acids significantly affect the incorporation process and preference. Intact OA(18:1) was incorporated to CL; LA(18:2) and ALA(18:3) were desaturated and elongated to long chain fatty  before the incorporation; GLA(18:3) and SDA(18:4) were unfavorable for the CL incorporation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899441>Discovery of lipid biomarkers correlated with disease progression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma using desorption electrospray ionization imaging mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) often results in recurrence or metastasis, and there are only a few clinically effective biomarkers for early diagnosis and personalized therapy.  changes have been widely studied using mass spectrometry (MS) of tissue lysates to identify novel biomarkers.

Lipid  disturbance and oxidative stress have strong links to the development of NAFLD, while autophagy was generally accepted as a key regulatory mechanism on these steps. Our previous studies indicated that cherry anthocyanins (CACN) protected against high fat diet-induced obesity and NALFD in C57BL/6 mice, while the underlying molecule mechanism is still unclear. Thus, in this study, we show that CACN protect against - (OA-) induced oxidative stress and attenuate lipid droplet accumulation in NAFLD cell models. According to the results of a transmission electron microscope (TEM), western blot, immunofluorescence (IF), and adenovirus transfection (Ad-mCherry-GFP-LC3B), autophagy is in accordance with the lipid-lowering effect induced by CACN. Further studies illustrate that CACN may activate autophagy via mTOR . In addition, an autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), was applied and the result suggested that autophagy indeed participates in the lipid clearance process in OA-induced lipid accumulation. All these results indicate that the positive effects of CACN on OA-induced hepatic lipid accumulation are mediated via activating autophagy, showing a potential target for the therapeutic strategy of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116430>Bamboo Leaf Flavonoids Extracts Alleviate Oxidative Stress in HepG2 Cells via Naturally Modulating Reactive Oxygen Species Production and Nrf2-Mediated Antioxidant Defense Responses.</a></h2><p>In this study, bamboo leaf flavonoids extracts (BFE) were employed to alleviate oxidative stress induced by  in HepG2 cells.

We aimed to conduct a preliminary exploration of the underlying mechanism of P. gingivalis infection in the development of NAFLD.Human hepatocellular cells HepG2 were incubated with/without  (OA) and tested for lipid accumulation upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from P. gingivalis or Escherichia coli. Intracellular lipid droplet formation was analyzed and quantified by Oil Red O staining. The involvement of signaling pathway molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines related to NF-κB and MAPKs were examined with Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses and further evaluated with inhibitor treatment and RNA interference.HepG2 cells accumulated more intracellular lipids when stimulated with P. gingivalis LPS, as compared to cells treated with E. coli LPS or control. Further pathway analysis demonstrated that after stimulation with P. gingivalis LPS, cells displayed significantly upregulated MyD88 expression, increased phosphorylation of p65 and JNK, and more release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-8, and TNF-α. In addition, suppression of phosphorylation of p65 and JNK by inhibitors and RNA interference resulted in a reduction in lipid accumulation upon P. gingivalis LPS treatment.These results suggest that P. gingivalis-derived LPS may contribute to intracellular lipid accumulation and inflammatory reaction of HepG2 cells via the activation of NF-κB and JNK signaling . This study offers a possible explanation to the functional involvement of P. gingivalis infection in the pathological progression of NAFLD. These findings may help design new treatment strategies in NAFLD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

We previously showed that linoleic  supplementation markedly affect aroma compound production of S. cerevisiae wine strains. However, very little is known about how other commonly found fatty acids in grape juice modulate the growth and  of S. cerevisiae. We aimed to determine the individual effect of five fatty acids on fermentation patterns and  of two wine yeast strains (S. cerevisiae EC1118 and X5). Microvinification was performed at 15 °C by supplementing a grape juice (individually) with three different concentrations of saturated (palmitic ), unsaturated (, linoleic and γ-linolenic acids) and short-chain (hexanoic ) fatty acids. Metabolite profiles of the resulting wines were determined using Gas-chromatography coupled to Mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). Our data show that the addition of γ-linolenic  to the juice caused the production of higher amounts of amino and organic acids (except isoleucine and 2-oxoglutaric ) in wines when fermented by EC1118, while palmitic  supplementation showed similar trends when fermented by X5. The effect of linoleic  was independent of yeast strains and we observed a global reduction of amino and organic acids (except pyruvic ) while increased production of most of the fatty acids other than the supplemented ones. Our data clearly suggest that pre-fermentative supplementation of different fatty acids indeed influenced the growth and  of wine yeasts in a different way. Thus, attention needs to be paid not only to the wine yeast strain used during the winemaking but also to the overall grape juice composition, including fatty acids, to obtain the desired wine characteristics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we investigated the potential protective effects of docosahexaenoic  (DHA) on inhibiting  (OA)-induced apoptosis and inflammation in grass carp hepatocytes. Firstly, the hepatocyte of grass carp were treated with OA (800 μM) and different concentration (0, 50, 100 and 200 μM) of DHA for 24 h, the apoptotic ratio, gene expression levels of apoptosis such as caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9, protein levels of Caspase3, and mRNA levels of inflammation genes such as nf-kb, tnf-α, and il-8 were detected. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of lipogenesis genes srebp1c, fas, acc, and scd and a key enzyme of lipolysis Atgl were also detected. These results showed that the cell apoptosis and the inflammation increased by OA were significantly attenuated by DHA (P < 0.05). Furthermore, DHA could significantly decrease fatty  synthesis gene expression levels which were induced by OA (P < 0.05). However, the hepatocytes exposed with DHA had no significant influence on the expression of Atgl. Taken together, the study indicated that DHA protects the hepatocytes against apoptosis and inflammation induced by OA might via inhibiting fatty  synthesis, instead of promoting lipolysis. These results call for further studies to assess the effectiveness of DHA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30694347>Non-obesogenic doses of fatty acids modulate the functionality of the circadian clock in the liver.</a></h2><p>Saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate, lead to circadian disruption in cell culture. Moreover, information regarding the effects of unsaturated fatty acids on circadian parameters is scarce. We aimed at studying the effects of low doses of saturated as well as unsaturated fatty acids on circadian  in vivo and at deciphering the mechanism by which fatty acids convey their effect. Mice were fed non-obesogenic doses of palm or olive oil and hepatocytes were treated with palmitate and oleate. Mice fed non-obesogenic doses of palm oil showed increased signaling towards fatty  synthesis, while olive oil increased signaling towards fatty  oxidation. Low doses of palmitate and oleate were sufficient to alter circadian rhythms, due to changes in the expression and/or activity of key  proteins. Palmitate, but not oleate, counteracted the reduction in lipid accumulation and BMAL1-induced expression of mitochondrial genes involved in fatty  oxidation. Palmitate was also found to interfere with the transcriptional activity of CLOCK:BMAL1 by preventing BMAL1 deacetylation and activation. In addition, palmitate, but not oleate, reduced PER2-mediated transcriptional activation and increased REV-ERBα-mediated transcriptional inhibition of Bmal1. The inhibition of PER2-mediated transcriptional activation by palmitate was achieved by interfering with PER2 nuclear translocation. Indeed, PER2 reduced fat accumulation in hepatocytes and this reduction was prevented by palmitate. Herein, we show that the detrimental  alteration seen with high doses of palmitate manifests itself early on even with non-obesogenic levels. This is achieved by modulating BMAL1 at several levels abrogating its activity and expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573329> promotes cell invasion through an integrin-linked kinase signaling pathway in renal cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The change of fatty  composition has been regarded as an indicator of altered lipid  during human tumourigenesis, but the details are still unclear. We have previously demonstrated a monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) named  (OA) was involved in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell growth, as an extracellular signaling molecule to regulate 786-O cell proliferation via the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) pathway. In this study, we further observe the effects of OA on cell invasion of RCC and the potential mechanism by which OA worked was determined. The transwell invasion assay showed OA increased cell invasion of RCC in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting results indicated ILK, COX-2, and MMP-9 proteins were involved for their high expressions and these effects were reversed when down-regulating the expression of ILK by special siRNA. The MMPs inhibitor GM6001 could weaken the abilities of OA on RCC cells invasion. These results suggested MUFA indeed affected cell invasion of RCC, which was depended by the regulation of ILK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035179>Enzymatic esterification of  by Candida rugosa lipase immobilized onto biochar.</a></h2><p>The immobilization of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) onto biochar was studied in a series of batch experiments. CRL sorption behavior was evaluated as a function of pH, enzyme concentration, temperature and ionic strength. As the immobilized lipase was used for the catalytic esterification of , its resistance to solvents and thermal stability were evaluated. CRL adsorption increased by increasing temperature, and with higher pH, reaching a maximum at pH 7.0. Immobilization increased lipase stability at 40 °C by more than 80% when compared to the free enzyme. Moreover, immobilized CRL showed high stability in the presence of tert-butanol, which prevents premature deactivation of the enzyme caused by alcohols during the reaction. Immobilization of CRL increased the  conversion rate. Our results suggest that biochar is a highly promising material for the immobilization of CRL lipase for the catalytic production of esters.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, its impact on atherosclerosis has not been examined in detail.LDL receptor knock out (LDLR-KO) mice are fed a Western diet supplemented with 5% (w/w) palmitoleate concentrate, -rich olive oil, or none (control) for 12 weeks. Dietary palmitoleate increases hepatic C16:1 levels, improves plasma and hepatic lipid/lipoprotein profiles (≈40% decrease in triglycerides), and reduces the atherosclerotic plaque area by ≈45% compared with control or olive oil group (p < 0.05). These favorable changes are accompanied by the downregulation of key genes, such as Srebp1c, Scd1, Il-1β, and Tnfα. ApoB-depleted plasma from mice fed palmitoleate has increased cholesterol efflux capacity by 20% from ABCA1-expressing cells (p < 0.05). A beneficial effect of palmitoleate on glucose  (54% decreased in HOMA-IR, p < 0.05) is also observed.Dietary-supplemented palmitoleate reduces atherosclerosis development in LDLR-KO mice, and is associated with improvement of lipid and glucose  and favorable changes in regulatory genes involved in lipogenesis and inflammation.

However, their use in bulk production, such as for the production of biodiesel, is still not cost effective, partly due to the possible poor use of desired substrates or poor robustness in the practical bioconversion process. We investigated the natural capacity of , a yeast already used in biotechnology, to store lipids under different conditions.The genotyping of seven strains showed the species to actually be composed of two different groups, one that (including the well-known strain LS3) could be reassigned to . We showed that, under nitrogen limitation, strains of both species can synthesize lipids to over 20% of their dry-cell weight during shake-flask cultivation in glucose or xylose medium for 96 h. In addition, organic acids were excreted into the medium. LS3, our best lipid-producing strain, could also accumulate lipids from exogenous , up to 38.1 ± 1.6% of its dry-cell weight, and synthesize lipids from various sugar substrates, up to 36.6 ± 0.5% when growing in cellobiose. Both species, represented by LS3 and CBS 8244, could grow with little filamentation in the lipogenic medium from 28 to 45 °C and reached lipid titers ranging from 1.76 ± 0.28 to 3.08 ± 0.49 g/L in flasks. Under these conditions, the maximum bioconversion yield (  = 0.093 ± 0.017) was obtained with LS3 at 37 °C. The presence of genes for predicted subunits of an ATP citrate lyase in the genome of LS3 reinforces its oleaginous character. and  which are known to be xerotolerant and genetically-tractable, are promising biotechnological yeasts of the Saccharomycotina that could be further developed through genetic engineering for the production of microbial oil. To our knowledge, this is the first report of efficient lipid storage in yeast when cultivated at a temperature above 40 °C.

Therefore the aim of the present study was the development and validation of an in vitro multiculture model allowing to measure intestinal absorption using adipocytes as lipid sensors. We previously described (1) novel methods to study  induction of adipogenesis and lipogenesis and (2) a functional reconstituted intestinal barrier using human cell lines Caco-2/HT29-MTX (9:1). In the present study we develop a co-culture model with either adipocytes or hepatocytes as sensors for intestinal lipid absorption. This model was validated using  (OA) pre-absorbed onto the intestinal barrier. Optimized experimental conditions were obtained with partially differentiated 3T3L1-MBX adipocytes sensing up to 5 μM OA in solution or 40 μM OA pre-absorbed by Caco2/HT29-MTX intestinal barriers.  including glycemia and insulinemia greatly influenced the ability to  TG accumulation in adipocytes. By comparison AML12 hepatocytes found less sensitive to OA (up to 1 μM). The present study demonstrates a much better functionality for fatty  uptake and release in Caco2/HT29-MTX versus Caco-2 intestinal barriers. Taken together these results open new opportunities to study in vitro lipid transfer between intestinal barriers and either adipocytes or hepatocytes.

Dietary habits are of special interest to prevent and counteract the obesity and its associated  disorders, including lipid steatosis. Capsaicin, a pungent compound of chili peppers, has been found to ameliorate diet-induced obesity in rodents and humans. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of capsaicin on hepatic lipogenesis and to delineate the underlying signaling  involved, using HepG2 cells as an experimental model. Cellular neutral lipids, stained with BODIPY493/503, were quantified by flow cytometry, and the protein expression and activity were determined by immunoblotting. Capsaicin reduced basal neutral lipid content in HepG2 cells, as well that induced by troglitazone or by . This effect of capsaicin was prevented by dorsomorphin and GW9662, pharmacological inhibitors of AMPK and PPARγ, respectively. In addition, capsaicin activated AMPK and inhibited the AKT/mTOR pathway, major regulators of hepatic lipogenesis. Furthermore, capsaicin blocked autophagy and increased PGC-1α protein.

Each fatty  increased the number of LDs and oxidized LDs (oxLDs) and the degree of LD oxidation time dependently, as well as increased intracellular triglyceride hydroperoxides. LDs induced by LA without 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) showed the most significant oxidation degree over PA and OA, especially in large LDs (area ≥ 3 μm, oxLD/LD = 52.3 ± 21.7%).

Initially, AmB emulsions were obtained with the chemical promoters,  and geraniol and without promoter, then for the evaluation of the formulations, a preliminary stability study was carried out where the formulations were submitted to centrifugation, before and after the freeze-thaw cycle and analyzed appearance, color, pH, spreadability, viscosity, conductivity, droplet size, assay, in vitro release study, in vitro antileishmania activity in Leishmania major promastigotes, and macrophage toxicity in the MTT test. The emulsions were yellowish, with no signs of instability after the centrifugation test. The pH range corresponded to that of the skin, which is 4.6 to 5.8, before and after the freeze-thaw cycle, the formulations had good spreadability and did not present significant viscosity differences before and after the freeze-thaw cycle, presenting a non-Newtonian characteristic.

We aimed to explore fatty  (FA) processing in human villous placental explants from seven uncomplicated term singleton pregnancies delivered by elective cesarean section. Explants were treated with stable isotope-labeled palmitic  (13C-PA),  (13C-OA), or docosahexaenoic  (13C-DHA) for 3, 24, or 48 hours. Stable isotope-labeled lipids synthesized by placental explants from labeled FA were quantified, alongside endogenous unlabeled placental lipids, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Labeled phosphatidylcholines (PCs), triacylglycerols (TAGs), and phosphatidylethanolamines were detected in explants, whereas labeled lysophosphatidylcholines were found in both explants and conditioned media. 13C-PA was primarily directed into PC synthesis (74% of 13C-PA-labeled lipids), whereas 13C-OA was directed almost equally into PC and TAG synthesis (45% and 53%, respectively, of 13C-OA-labeled lipids). 13C-DHA was only detectable in TAGs. TAGs demonstrated the highest isotopic enrichment for all 13C-FAs with 13C-OA-TAGs comprising >50% of total OA-TAGs (unlabeled and labeled), consistent with TAGs being a labile and accessible reservoir for FA storage. Variations in lipid incorporation were correlated to maternal glycemia and body mass index, suggesting that this experimental model could be used to investigate the effect of maternal factors on placental lipid . We conclude that lipid  partitioning of freshly imported FAs into labile and less labile lipid reservoirs in placenta is FA dependent. This process may partly mediate the physiological preferential transplacental transfer of particular FAs to the fetus, but may also be implicated in the fetoplacental pathophysiology of maternal  dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425639>Oleaginous yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii shows fermentative  of sugars in the biosynthesis of ethanol and converts raw glycerol and cheese whey permeate into polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>We studied the biotechnological potential of the recently isolated yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii BI281A to produce polyunsaturated fatty acids and ethanol, comparing products yields using glucose, raw glycerol from biodiesel synthesis, or whey permeate as substrates.

There was interaction between gender and aging time for Warner-Bratzler Shear Force (p = 0.0002), L* (p = 0.0118), and b* (p = 0.0113) values of beef. The sensory panel results showed that beef from bulls had the lowest consumer overall acceptance (p = 0.0278). Especially, regardless tenderness, steers and immunocastrated beef were considered tender, independent of aging time. Beef produced by heifers, steers, and immunocastrated is considered to be of higher quality than bulls. Thus, it is may be an interesting alternative to produce high-quality beef than bulls, to attend the consumer demand for high-quality products. Additionally, the low fatty acids n6 levels and low n6:n3 ratio, high levels of CLA, MUFAs, and  suggests that the heifer meat is favorable for human health.© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126502>Removal of phthalic  esters from sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) pulp oil by steam distillation and molecular distillation.</a></h2><p>Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) pulp oils (SPOs) are rich in a variety of beneficial bioactive ingredients. Nevertheless, SPOs would be exposed to plastic equipment during processing, resulted in increasing phthalates contents and edible risk, as well as affecting oil quality. For these reasons, the effects of two stages steam distillation (SD2) and two stages molecular distillation (MD2) on phthalic  esters (PAEs) content were investigated and compared in the present work. Compared with SD2, MD2 showed higher removal rates of seven selected PAEs from the SPO. Even if the initial concentration of DBP and DEHP in R-SPO were 1.626 and 10.933 mg/kg respectively, the concentration of DBP and DINP could be reduced below the limit set by China government after treated with MD2. Besides that, there was no trans-fatty acids generated in SPO during the distillation process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Results showed that 2 alkyl furans and 23 volatile aldehydes including 4 toxic OdβUAs were detected by GC-MS. The original fatty  compositions of the oils played a key role in the type and concentration of those volatile compounds. 4-Hydroxy-2-hexenal (HHE) and ethyl furan were only detected in PAO with a high content of linolenic , while the greatest level of pentyl furan was detected in PO with abundant linoleic . Greater amounts of 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-nonenal (HNE) and 4-oxo-(E)-2-nonenal (ONE) were formed in the OVO with abundant . The close relativity of HHE and ethyl furan was also demonstrated. With principal component analysis, these vegetable oils could be discriminated based on their fatty acids and volatile compounds. The loading plot confirmed that HHE and ethyl furan were derived from the linolenic  oxidation and degradation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The chemometric results showed that the formation of the volatile components during heating in different vegetable oils has close correlation with the original fatty acids composition of vegetable oils. Our research has also confirmed the presence of toxic OɑβUAs in oils after heating. Considering that they are proven to generate lots of degenerative diseases, further studies are needed to establish the risk level of using certain oils in frying and seek effective methods to inhibit their formation.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30876460>Co-administration of 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (g-PPT) and EGFR-TKI overcomes EGFR-TKI resistance by decreasing SCD1 induced lipid accumulation in non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with sensitive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are successfully treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs); however, resistance to treatment inevitably occurs.

The correlations between transcripts and proteins for the comparative group 16 h vs 14 h accounted for only 4.20% quantified proteins and 3.23% differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), respectively, much higher percentages of correlations (30.56%-59.11%) were found for other comparative groups (i.e., 18 h vs 14 h, 20 h vs 14 h, and 22 h vs 14 h). According to Spearman correlation tests between transcriptome and proteome (the absolute value of a correlation coefficient between 0.5 and 1 indicates a strong correlation), poor correlations were found for all quantified proteins ( = - 0.0355 to 0.0138), DEPs ( = - 0.0079 to 0.0233) and the DEPs with opposite expression trends to corresponding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) ( = - 0.0478 to 0.0636), whereas stronger correlations were observed in terms of the DEPs with the same expression trends as the correlated DEGs ( = 0.5593 to 0.7080).

Significant reduction of shoot elongation (-12%) during salt treatments (80 mM NaCl) was associated with the translocation of Na in the aerial part. After 75 days of treatment, fruits from each plant were subdivided into four maturation groups (MG, MG, MG, MG) according to ripening degrees. Na accumulation increased in each MG under salinity, reaching the highest values in MG fruits (2654 mg kg DW). Salinity caused an acceleration of the ripening process, increased fruit number and decreased total fatty acids content in MG. An increase in  at MG (53%) was detected, with consequent increase in the /linoleic (41%) and decrease in the polyunsaturated/monounsaturated ratios (30%). Those variations could be explained by the synergic up-regulation of OeSAD1, together with the down-regulation of OeFAD6 transcript levels.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The mechanisms by which the risk variants cause kidney damage, although not well-understood, are believed to involve injury to glomerular podocytes. The intracellular localization and function of APOL1 in podocytes remain unclear, with recent studies suggesting possible roles in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagosomes. Here, we demonstrate that APOL1 also localizes to intracellular lipid droplets (LDs). While a large fraction of risk variant APOL1 (G1 and G2) localizes to the ER, a significant proportion of wild-type APOL1 (G0) localizes to LDs. APOL1 transiently interacts with numerous organelles, including the ER, mitochondria, and endosomes. Treatment of cells that promote LD formation with  shifted the localization of G1 and G2 from the ER to LDs, with accompanying reduction of autophagic flux and cytotoxicity. Coexpression of G0 APOL1 with risk variant APOL1 enabled recruitment of G1 and G2 from the ER to LDs, accompanied by reduced cell death. The ability of G0 APOL1 to recruit risk variant APOL1 to LDs may help explain the recessive pattern of kidney disease inheritance. These studies establish APOL1 as a bona fide LD-associated protein, and reveal that recruitment of risk variant APOL1 to LDs reduces cell toxicity, autophagic flux, and cell death. Thus, interventions that divert APOL1 risk variants to LDs may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to alleviate their cytotoxic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30814550>Serum Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Correlate with Serum Cytokines and Clinical Disease Activity in Crohn's Disease.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease (CD) has been associated with an increased consumption of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), while greater intake of n-3 PUFA has been associated with a reduced risk.

Hyperlipidemia, which is characterized by the excess accumulation of lipid contents in the bloodstream, may lead to several cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, in this study, anti-hyperlipidemic potential of U. macrocarpa water extract (UME) was examined in vitro and in vivo using HepG2 cells and experimental rats, respectively. The hyperlipidemia in experimental rats was induced by the high-cholesterol diet (HCD) followed by oral administration of various concentrations (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) of UME for 6 weeks. As a result, the UME significantly improved the biochemical parameters such as increased the level of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as reduced the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the HCD-fed rats. In addition, UME also prevented lipid accumulation through regulating AMPK activity and lipid  proteins (ACC, SREBP1 and HMGCR) in the HCD-fed rats as compared to the controls. Moreover, similar pattern of gene expression levels was confirmed in  (OA)-treated HepG2 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that UME prevents hyperlipidemia via activating the AMPK pathway and regulates lipid .

However, the underlying mechanisms by which PS modulates lipid  are largely unknown. To address this question, serial doses of PS extract (PSE) were added to 3T3-L1 cells during adipocyte differentiation. PSE (25 µg/mL) significantly attenuated adipogenesis by inhibiting lipid accumulation in addition to reducing the level of adipogenic protein and gene expression with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Other adipocyte cell models such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts C3H10T1/2 and primary adipocytes also confirmed the anti-adipogenic properties of PSE. Next, we investigated whether PSE attenuated lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes. We found that PSE significantly suppressed lipogenic gene expression, while fatty  (FA) oxidation genes were upregulated. Augmentation of FA oxidation by PSE in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes was confirmed via a radiolabeled-FA oxidation rate experiment by measuring the conversion of [³H]- (OA) to [³H]-H₂O. Furthermore, PSE enhanced the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), especially maximal respiration, and beige adipocyte formation in adipocytes. In summary, PSE was effective in reducing lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes through mitochondrial fatty  oxidation involved in AMPK and mitochondrial activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374159>pH effects on the lipid and fatty acids accumulation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.</a></h2><p>pH variations influence the delivery of essential nutrients and CO solubility, which impact algae . In this study the microalgal growth and chlorophyll, lipid, and fatty acids content; along with the expression of some genes implicated in the biosynthesis of lipids were examined in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii subjected to pH values of 7.0, 7.8, and 8.5. At pH 7.8 an increase in cell growth was observed with a significant accumulation of chlorophyll (1.75-fold) when compared with growth at pH 7, while at pH 8.5 a sharp decrease in both parameters was observed when compared with the other pH values tested. Lipid content increased 3.0 (14.81% of dry cell weight, dcw) and 2.3 times (11.43% dcw) at pH 7.8 and 8.5, respectively, when compared with the experiment at pH 7 (4.97% dcw). The compositions of major fatty acids in the strains growing at pH 7.0, 7.8, or 8.5 were 25.7, 28.0, and 32.1% for palmitic ; 17.3, 14.7, and 25.7% for ; and 9.8, 12.1, and 4.6% for linoleic ; respectively. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the transcripts of ß-carboxyltransferase, Acyl carrier protein 1, acyl-ACP thiolase 1, acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, and diacylglycerol acyl transferase isoform 3 were significantly induced at pH 7.8 when compared with the other two pH conditions. These results indicate that the induction of genes implicated in the early and final steps of lipid biosynthesis contributes to their accumulation in the stationary phase. Our research suggests that a pH of 7.8 might be ideal to maximize growth and lipid accumulation.© 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864855>Fermented  Extract Ameliorates Hepatosteatosis via Activation of Fatty  Oxidation.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a progressive disease involving the accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver. In this study, we investigated the anti-hepatosteatosis effects of fermented  extract (CME) in AML-12 hepatocytes. Although the levels of adenosine and cordycepin were reduced in the extracts of CM grown on germinated soybean (GSCE) and fermented CM grown on germinated soybean (GSC) by  ON188 (ON188E), the expression of fatty  oxidation (FAO) genes were upregulated only by GSC-ON188E treatment in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, a lipogenic gene, stearoyl Coenzyme A desaturase 1, was downregulated by ON188E. Formation of intracellular lipid droplets by the addition of  was reduced by ON188E to levels observed in WY14643-treated cells. When cells were treated with ON188E, sphingosine kinase 2 mainly responsible for hepatic sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) synthesis was upregulated and S1P was elevated. Collectively, the fermented GSC extract activates FAO through elevation of S1P synthesis and has potential as a therapeutic for hepatosteatosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469345>Tanycytic TSPO inhibition induces lipophagy to regulate lipid  and improve energy balance.</a></h2><p>Hypothalamic glial cells named tanycytes, which line the 3 ventricle (3V), are components of the hypothalamic network that regulates a diverse array of  functions for energy homeostasis. Herein, we report that TSPO (translocator protein), an outer mitochondrial protein, is highly enriched in tanycytes and regulates homeostatic responses to nutrient excess as a potential target for an effective intervention in obesity. Administration of a TSPO ligand, PK11195, into the 3V, and tanycyte-specific deletion of  reduced food intake and elevated energy expenditure, leading to negative energy balance in a high-fat diet challenge. Ablation of tanycytic  elicited AMPK-dependent lipophagy, breaking down lipid droplets into free fatty acids, thereby elevating ATP in a lipid stimulus. Our findings suggest that tanycytic TSPO affects systemic energy balance through macroautophagy/autophagy-regulated lipid , and highlight the physiological significance of TSPO in hypothalamic lipid sensing and bioenergetics in response to overnutrition.  3V: 3 ventricle; ACAC: acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase; AGRP: agouti related neuropeptide; AIF1/IBA1: allograft inflammatory factor 1; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ARC: arcuate nucleus; Atg: autophagy related; Bafilo: bafilomycin A; CAMKK2: calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2, beta; CCCP: carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; CNS: central nervous system; COX4I1: cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4I1; FFA: free fatty ; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; HFD: high-fat diet; ICV: intracerebroventricular; LAMP2: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2; LD: lipid droplet; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MBH: mediobasal hypothalamus; ME: median eminence; MEF: mouse embryonic fibroblast; NCD: normal chow diet; NEFM/NFM: neurofilament medium; NPY: neuropeptide Y; OL: ; POMC: pro-opiomelanocortin-alpha; PRKN/Parkin: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; : retina and anterior neural fold homeobox; RBFOX3/NeuN: RNA binding protein, fox-1 homolog (C. elegans) 3; RER: respiratory exchange ratio; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TG: triglyceride; TSPO: translocator protein; ULK1: unc-51 like kinase 1; VCO: carbon dioxide production; VMH: ventromedial hypothalamus; VO: oxygen consumption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717278>Human Tongue Electrophysiological Response to  and Its Associations with PROP Taster Status and the  Polymorphism ().</a></h2><p>The perception of fat varies among individuals and has also been associated with  polymorphism and genetic ability to perceive oral marker 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP).

We report for the first time, in humans and in vivo, the kinetics of placental FA transfer in normo-weight and in normolipemic obese pregnant women using stable isotopes. The administration of different tracer FA with similar behaviour to the mother at different time points allows the collection of kinetic information on materno-fetal transfer of FA despite only one sample of placenta and cord can be collected per subject. Computational modelling showed a good fit to the data when considering all maternal plasma lipid classes but not when based only on non-esterified FA. The novel approach using multiple tracer FA administration combined with computational modelling shows a consistent time course of placental tracer FA and predicted total FA accumulation.We analyse for the first time the in vivo materno-fetal kinetic transfer of fatty acids (FA) labelled with stable isotopes in control and obese (OB) pregnant women. Labelled FA with a similar  (stearic :  C-SA; palmitic :  C-PA; :  C-OA) were orally administered at -4 h, -8 h and -12 h, respectively prior to elective caesarean section to 10 pregnant women with a body mass index >30 (OB) and 10 with a body mass index in the range 20-25 (NW). Placenta, venous and arterial cord blood were collected obtaining a wide range of FA enrichments. A combined experimental and computational modelling analysis was applied. FA fractional synthesis rate (FSR) in placenta was 11-12% h . No differences were observed between NW and normo-lipidemic OB. It was not possible to estimate FA FSR in cord blood with this oral bolus dose approach. Computational modelling demonstrated a good fit to the data when all maternal plasma lipid classes were included but not with modelling based only on the non-esterified FA fraction. The estimated materno-fetal  C-FA transfer was ∼1%. In conclusion, our approach using multiple  C-FA tracers allowed us to estimated FSR in placental/maternal plasma but not in fetal/maternal compartments. Computational modelling showed a consistent time course of placental  C-FA transfer and predicted total fetal FA accumulation during the experiment. We conclude that, in addition to non-esterified FA fraction in the maternal circulation, maternal plasma very low-density lipoprotein and other lipoproteins are important contributors to placental FA transfer to the fetus.© 2019 The Authors.

To explore the interplay between HSA interaction with Zn/Cu and the plasma unsaturated fatty acids (DHA, LA, OA, and arachidonic  (ArA)), we have studied the metal dependence of the fatty  (FA) binding capacity of HSA (n) and structural consequences of the HSA-FA interactions. HSA loading with Zn decreases n value by 0.3-1.5, while its saturation with Cu causes the FA-dependent n changes by up to 0.9. The Cu-induced decline in n value for DHA is due to conformational rearrangements in HSA molecule. In other cases, the changes in n are attributed to steric hindarance/facilitation of the HSA-FA interaction because of the protein multimerization/monomerization, as confirmed by chemical crosslinking. The surface hydrophobicity of HSA is Cu-, Zn-, and FA-dependent and decreases upon the FA binding, according to bis-ANS fluorescence data. Overall, Zn or Cu binding selectively affect HSA interaction with the FAs studied, in part due to changes in quaternary structure of the protein.Copyright © 2019.

In the current study, we investigated the effects of PCW extract on hepatic steatosis under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free fatty  (FFA)-palmitic and -and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice liver were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with lipogenesis, fatty  oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with fatty  oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCW ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the regulation of lipid , inhibition of ER stress, and activation of autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. This suggested that PCW can be potentially used for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31229116>1-MCP treatment affects peach fruit aroma  as revealed by transcriptomics and metabolite analyses.</a></h2><p>1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) negatively affects peach aroma but the underlying molecular basis remains elusive. In this study, transcriptomics and metabolite analyses were carried out to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of 1-MCP on peach aroma from different standpoints: fatty  (FA) , ethylene signal transduction and lipoxygenase/β-oxidation pathway during 20 °C storage. Results indicate that 1-MCP significantly postponed the ethylene climacteric peak appearance and reduced ethylene production through down-regulation of related biosynthesis and signal transduction genes including PpaSAMS1/2, PpaACS1/2, PpaACO1 together with PpaETR1/2, PpaERS1, PpaEIN4 and PpaCTR1. Decrease in the levels of FAs and PpaFADs was observed in treated fruit, except  and PpaFAD4/5, before day 5 of storage. In addition, 1-MCP-treated fruit also possessed higher levels of C6 aldehydes and alcohols and delayed the formation of volatile compounds characteristic of peach-like aroma by upregulation of PpaLOX1/2/3 and PpaHPL1 expression and down-regulation of PpaLOX5 expression. Our findings suggest that inhibition of peach-like volatiles and promotion of green-note volatiles by 1-MCP were associated with ethylene production and modulation of FA levels through transcriptional regulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, kinetics of heterogeneous reaction of ozone with six unsaturated fatty acids (, vaccenic , eladic , myristoleic , palmitoleic  and 2-hexadecenoic ) were studied via a flow system combined with attenuated total reflection Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Pseudo-first-order rate constants (k) and overall reactive uptake coefficients (γ) values were derived according to the changes in absorbance from infrared spectra. Results have shown reaction rates are highly dependent on structures of unsaturated fatty acids. Cis-isomer has faster reaction kinetics than trans-isomer, and conjugated system between CC and CO bonds can greatly inhibit reactivity. Also, it is found that a longer carbon chain length between CC bond and COOH group or a shorter chain length between CC bond and last carbon seemingly enhances reaction kinetics. In addition, changes in redox activity and hydrophilicity of  samples before and after exposure ozone have been reported for the first time.

Previous studies have indicated that the C18:1 content is a polygenic trait, and no stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) except for FAD2 have been reported. By performing a GWAS using 375 low erucic  B. napus accessions genotyped with the Brassica 60K SNP array and constructing a high-density SNP-based genetic map of a 150 DH population, we identified a novel QTL on the A9 chromosome. The novel locus could explain 11.25%, 5.72% and 6.29% of phenotypic variation during three consecutive seasons and increased the C18:1 content by approximately 3%-5%. By fine mapping and gene expression analysis, we found three potential candidate genes and verified the fatty acids in a homologous gene mutant of Arabidopsis. A metal ion-binding protein was found to be the most likely candidate gene in the region. Thus, the C18:1 content can be further increased to about 80% with this novel locus together with FAD2 mutant allele without compromise of agronomic performance. A closely linked marker, BnA129, for this novel QTL (OLEA9) was developed so that we can effectively identify materials with high C18:1 content at an early growth stage by marker-assisted selection.

However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of Plin5 are not clear. The goal of the present study was to explore the mechanism of  (OA)-induced Plin5 expression in HepG2 cells. We found that the expression of Plin5 was increased during OA-induced lipid droplets formation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. During this process of OA-stimulated lipid droplets formation, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) was also upregulated. When PPARα activation was blocked by GW6471, OA-induced Plin5 expression and lipid droplets formation were effectively ablated. We further found that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 was able to downregulate both PPARα and Plin5 expression and lipid droplets formation. Thus, we concluded that PI3K may, at least in part, act upstream of PPARα to regulate Plin5 expression and lipid droplets formation in HepG2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728499>Evidence for an alternative fatty  desaturation pathway increasing cancer plasticity.</a></h2><p>Most tumours have an aberrantly activated lipid  that enables them to synthesize, elongate and desaturate fatty acids to support proliferation.

We identify various cancer cell lines, mouse hepatocellular carcinomas, and primary human liver and lung carcinomas that desaturate palmitate to the unusual fatty  sapienate to support membrane biosynthesis during proliferation. Accordingly, we found that sapienate biosynthesis enables cancer cells to bypass the known fatty  desaturation pathway that is dependent on stearoyl-CoA desaturase.

These FAs are intracellularly converted into triglyceride (TG) molecules, before they are packaged into chylomicrons for transport to the lymph or into cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) for intracellular storage. A crucial step for the formation of LDs is the catalytic activity of diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) in the final step of TG synthesis. LDs are important to buffer toxic lipid species and regulate cellular  in different cell types. Since the human intestinal epithelium is regularly confronted with high concentrations of lipids, LD formation is of great importance to regulate homeostasis. Here we describe a simple assay for the characterization and quantification of LD formation (LDF) upon stimulation with the most common unsaturated fatty , , in human intestinal organoids. The LDF assay is based on the LD-specific fluorescent dye LD540, which allows for quantification of LDs by confocal microscopy, fluorescent plate reader, or flow cytometry. The LDF assay can be used to characterize LD formation in human intestinal epithelial cells, or to study human (genetic) disorders that affect LD , such as DGAT1 deficiency.

Although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α/β (PPARα/β) activation has been shown to exert beneficial effects on age-associated renal changes, its effects on age-associated renal fibrosis have not been investigated yet. Here, we show that the PPARα/β activator, MHY2013, can significantly alter lipid  in renal tubule epithelial cells and attenuate renal fibrosis in aged Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. We found that MHY2013 significantly increased nuclear translocation and activity of PPARα/β in NRK52E renal epithelial cells. Moreover, the enhanced PPARα/β activity increased the expression of fatty  oxidation-associated PPARα/β target genes. In addition, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)- and -induced lipid accumulation and fibrosis-associated gene expression were decreased in NRK52E cells by MHY2013 pretreatment. To evaluate the effects of MHY2013 on age-associated renal fibrosis, aged SD rates were orally administered MHY2013 (1 and 5 mg/kg) daily for 1 month. MHY2013 efficiently increased PPARα/β activation and reduced renal lipid accumulation in aged SD rat kidneys. Furthermore, renal fibrosis was significantly decreased by MHY2013, indicating the importance of renal lipid  in age-associated renal fibrosis. Taken together, our results suggest that activation of PPARα/β signaling during aging prevents age-associated renal fibrosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, molecular mechanisms regulating lipophagy are still largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effect of  (OA) on lipophagy in cells. We found that OA treatment results in accumulation of p62 and LC3-II proteins and reduces red fluorescence in cells stably expressing mCherry-GFP-LC3. In addition, OA inhibits the co-localization of LC3 with LAMP1 under serum-deprived condition, suggesting that OA blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion. In the cells with ATG5 or ULK1 gene deletion, LDs did not increase upon OA treatment more than in wild type cells. However, cell starvation following OA removal resulted in reduced lipid accumulation by lipophagy and recovery of autophagy flux, suggesting that the specific condition of OA treatment and cell starvation are important for lipophagy flux activity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization study to explore these relationships.Summary-level data from up to 426 824 individuals in UK Biobank for estimated bone mineral density (eBMD) derived from heel quantitative ultrasound and bone fractures were used in this study. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with plasma phospholipid FA levels at genome-wide significance were exploited as instrumental variables. Analyses were conducted using the inverse-variance weighted method.Eight of ten FAs were associated with eBMD and fracture risk. Specifically, genetic predisposition to higher plasma α-linolenic , linoleic , palmitoleic , and  levels was positively associated with eBMD and inversely associated with the odds of fracture, whereas the opposite directions were observed for plasma arachidonic , eicosapentaenoic , docosapentanenoic , and stearic  levels. Most of the associations were driven by single-nucleotide polymorphisms within or nearby the FADS1 and FADS2 genes, which explained the largest proportion of variance in FA levels.

Despite extensive stem cell therapy studies, clinical trials using cardiac progenitor cells have shown moderate results. Furthermore, differentiation of endogenous progenitors to mature cardiomyocytes is rarely reported. A  switch from glucose to fatty  oxidation occurs during cardiac development and cardiomyocyte maturation, however in vitro differentiation protocols do not consider the lack of fatty acids in cell culture media. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of this  switch on control and differentiated adult cardiac progenitors, by fatty  supplementation. Addition of  stimulated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha pathway and led to maturation of the cardiac progenitors, both before and after transforming growth factor-beta 1 differentiation. Addition of  following differentiation increased expression of myosin heavy chain 7 and connexin 43. Also, total glycolytic  increased, as did mitochondrial membrane potential and glucose and fatty  transporter expression. This work provides new insights into the importance of fatty acids, and of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, in cardiac progenitor differentiation.

We investigated the effect of myo-inositol on fatty- processing in human placental-explants from uncomplicated pregnancies. Explants were incubated with 13C-labeled palmitic-, 13C- and 13C-docosahexaenoic- across a range of myo-inositol concentrations for 24 h and 48 h. The incorporation of labeled-fatty-acids into individual lipids was quantified by liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry. At 24 h, myo-inositol increased the amount of 13C-palmitic- and 13C- labeled lipids (median fold-change relative to control=1). Significant effects were seen with 30 µM myo-inositol (physiological) for 13C-palmitic--lysophosphatidylcholines (1.26) and 13C-palmitic--phosphatidylethanolamines (1.17). At 48 h, myo-inositol addition increased 13C--lipids but decreased 13C-palmitic- and 13C-docosahexaenoic- lipids. Significant effects were seen with 30 µM myo-inositol for 13C--phosphatidylcholines (1.25), 13C--phosphatidylethanolamines (1.37) and 13C--triacylglycerols (1.32) and with 100 µM myo-inositol for 13C-docosahexaenoic--triacylglycerols (0.78). Lipids labeled with the same 13C-fatty- showed similar responses when tested at the same time-point, suggesting myo-inositol alters upstream processes such as fatty- uptake or activation. Myo-inositol supplementation may alter placental lipid physiology with unknown clinical consequences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640132>Effects of Dietary Supplementation of Alpha-Ketoglutarate in a Low-Protein Diet on Fatty  Composition and Lipid  Related Gene Expression in Muscles of Growing Pigs.</a></h2><p>The aim of the current study was to investigate whether dietary supplementation with alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) in a reduced crude protein (CP) diet would affect fatty  composition and lipid  related gene expression in the muscles of growing pigs. A total of 27 Large White × Landrace growing pigs at 44 ± 1 d of age (11.96 ± 0.18 kg) were randomly allocated to three treatments ( = 9). Dietary treatments included: (1) normal protein diet with 20% crude protein (CP) (NP); (2) a low crude protein diet formulated to contain approximately 17% CP (LP); and (3) a low crude protein diet with 17% CP supplemented with 1% AKG at the expense of regular corn components (ALP). The experimental trial lasted 35 d. The results showed that compared with the NP and LP diets, supplementation with AKG in a low-protein diet increased the intramuscular fat (IMF),  (C18:1n-9), and monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) contents ( < 0.05), and tended to increase the percentage of palmitoleic  (C16:1) and stearic  (C18:0) ( < 0.10) in the biceps femoris and longissimus dorsi muscles of growing pigs. These effects may be associated with increased relative mRNA expression levels of fatty  synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1 (ADD1), fatty  binding protein 4 (FABP4), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in skeletal muscle, indicating that AKG might be involved in the differential regulation of some key lipogenic genes in skeletal muscles of pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908685>Essential Fatty  Requirements and Intravenous Lipid Emulsions.</a></h2><p>Linoleic  (LA) and α-linolenic  (ALA) must be supplied to the human body and are therefore considered essential fatty acids. This narrative review discusses the signs, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of essential fatty  deficiency (EFAD). EFAD may occur in patients with conditions that severely limit the intake, digestion, absorption, and/or  of fat. EFAD may be prevented in patients requiring parenteral nutrition by inclusion of an intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) as a source of LA and ALA. Early ILEs consisted solely of soybean oil (SO), a good source of LA and ALA, but being rich in LA may promote the production of proinflammatory fatty acids. Subsequent ILE formulations replaced part of the SO with other fat sources to decrease the amount of proinflammatory fatty acids. Although rare, EFAD is diagnosed by an elevated triene:tetraene (T:T) ratio, which reflects increased  of  to Mead  in the absence of adequate LA and ALA. Assays for measuring fatty acids have improved over the years, and therefore it is necessary to take into account the particular assay used and its reference range when determining if the T:T ratio indicates EFAD. In patients with a high degree of suspicion for EFAD, obtaining a fatty  profile may provide additional useful information for making a diagnosis of EFAD. In patients receiving an ILE, the T:T ratio and fatty  profile should be interpreted in light of the fatty  composition of the ILE to ensure accurate diagnosis of EFAD.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323448>Effect of moisture on wheat grains lipid patterns and infection with Fusarium graminearum.</a></h2><p>Suitable conditions of temperature and humidity are required to maintain wheat grains quality, but during processing and storage, the grains can be exposed to adverse environmental conditions and presence of infectious fungi. Fusarium graminearum, the main causal agent of Fusarium head blight on wheat, affects crop yields and grain quality by alteration of their biochemical components and mycotoxin contamination, which reduces the possibilities of wheat end use and compromises food safety. Lipid degradation by hydrolytic, oxidative and microbial deterioration is the predominant cause of the loss of sensory acceptability, nutritional value and baking quality. The aim of this research was to determine the influence of adverse environmental conditions -as the increasing moisture - on lipid patterns of whole wheat flours contaminated with F. graminearum in relation to the infection degree. In vitro cultures of F. graminearum were carried out on wheat grains under different degrees of relative humidity (11, 50, 75 and 100%) throughout 45 days of incubation at 28 °C. The fungal biomass measured by q-PCR increased proportionally with the humidity. A decrease in the signals of saturated (palmitic and estearic) and unsaturated (, linoleic and linolenic) fatty acids, analyzed as fatty  methyl esters (FAMEs) by GC-MS, was observed in relation with the humidity and infection degree. The degradation rate of the lipids was high during the first 15 days of incubation, reaching the fatty acids content, values around 20-40% of those found in the control. From that moment on, the rate of degradation was slower or even null. It was observed that in all treatments, the linolenic  reached the highest degradation ratio in comparison with the other fatty acids, which may be caused by the action of lipoxygenases. The lipase activity and the content of deoxynivalenol were also determinate on the flours. The lipase activity increased until day 25 of incubation reaching twice the initial value. The deoxynivalenol content also increased along incubation while fatty acids decreased. Our results demonstrated that the magnitude in the signal of fatty acids in whole wheat flours varied in relation to the degree of humidity and fungal infection of the grains from which they were obtained. Otherwise, lipids and their oxidation products are related with the pathogenesis and production of mycotoxins. These observations highlight the importance of an adequate manipulation of wheat grains on the processing chain to prevent quality changes and mycotoxins contamination.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Lipid droplets (LDs) consisting of neutral- and phospho-lipids increase in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. However, the role of LDs and its lipid source remains largely unexplored. Here, we found that  (OA) was a potent inducer of astrocytic LD accumulation among various FAs. Lipidomic analysis using liquid chromatography equipped with tandem mass spectrometry revealed that the cellular triacylglycerol and phospholipid compositions in astrocytes during LD accumulation reflected the condition of extracellular FAs. Furthermore, the inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase blocked OA-induced LD accumulation and caused lipotoxicity-induced cell death in astrocytes. The present study demonstrated that the formation of LDs, caused due to the increased extracellular OA, facilitated survival against lipotoxic condition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that all winter-sown cultivars produced 20% more seed yield than the summer-sown crop. The longer growing period of winter-sown  resulted in higher biomass production. However, the fatty   of individual cultivars was different between winter-sown rape (WAT) and summer-sown rape (SAT). The absolute fatty  content of LOA and MOA cultivars in WAT were significantly higher than that in SAT, but that of HOA was opposite.

This study elucidated the mechanisms of brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (Bmal1) in the protective effects of RES against liver lipid  disorders. The results indicated that RES ameliorated free fatty  (FFA)-induced ( (OA): palmitic  (PA) = 2:1) glycolipid  disorders in hepatocytes. Simultaneously, RES partially reverted the relatively shallow daily oscillations of FFA-induced circadian clock gene transcription and protein expression in HepG2 cells.

At least in the case of COX-2, the enzyme becomes folded into a stable Eallo/Ecat pair. Some COX inhibitors ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and coxibs) and common fatty acids (FAs) modulate Ecat activity by binding Eallo. However, the interactions and outcomes often differ between isoforms. For example, naproxen directly and completely inhibits COX-1 by binding Ecat but indirectly and incompletely inhibits COX-2 by binding Eallo. Additionally, COX-1 is allosterically inhibited up to 50% by common FAs like palmitic , whereas COX-2 is allosterically activated 2-fold by palmitic . FA binding to Eallo also affects responses to COX inhibitors. Thus, COXs are physiologically and pharmacologically regulated by the FA tone of the milieu in which each operates-COX-1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and COX-2 in the Golgi apparatus. Cross-talk between Eallo and Ecat involves a loop in Eallo immediately downstream of Arg-120. Mutational studies suggest that allosteric modulation requires a direct interaction between the carboxyl group of allosteric effectors and Arg-120 of Eallo; however, structural studies show some allosterically active FAs positioned in COX-2 in a conformation lacking an interaction with Arg-120. Thus, many details about the biological consequences of COX allosterism and how ligand binding to Eallo modulates Ecat remain to be resolved.© 2019 Smith and Malkowski.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31064829> Encodes an Atypical Auxiliary Acyl Carrier Protein Required for Efficient Regulation of Fatty  Synthesis by Exogenous Fatty Acids.</a></h2><p>Acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) play essential roles in the synthesis of fatty acids and transfer of long fatty acyl chains into complex lipids. The  genome contains two annotated  genes, called  and  AcpA is encoded within the fatty  synthesis (fab) operon and appears essential. In contrast, AcpB is an atypical ACP, having only 30% residue identity with AcpA, and is not essential. Deletion of  has no effect on  growth or  fatty  synthesis in media lacking fatty acids. However, unlike the wild-type strain, where growth with  resulted in almost complete blockage of  fatty  synthesis, the  strain largely continued  fatty  synthesis under these conditions. Blockage in the wild-type strain is due to repression of  operon transcription, leading to levels of fatty  synthetic proteins (including AcpA) that are insufficient to support  synthesis. Transcription of the  operon is regulated by FabT, a repressor protein that binds DNA only when it is bound to an acyl-ACP ligand. Since AcpA is encoded in the  operon, its synthesis is blocked when the operon is repressed and  thus cannot provide a stable supply of ACP for synthesis of the acyl-ACP ligand required for DNA binding by FabT. In contrast to AcpA,  transcription is unaffected by growth with exogenous fatty acids and thus provides a stable supply of ACP for conversion to the acyl-ACP ligand required for repression by FabT. Indeed,  and  strains have essentially the same  fatty  synthesis phenotype in -grown cultures, which argues that neither strain can form the FabT-acyl-ACP repression complex. Finally, acylated derivatives of both AcpB and AcpA were substrates for the  enoyl-ACP reductases and for  PlsX (acyl-ACP; phosphate acyltransferase). AcpB homologs are encoded by many, but not all, lactic  bacteria (), including many members of the human microbiome. The mechanisms regulating fatty  synthesis by exogenous fatty acids play a key role in resistance of these bacteria to those antimicrobials targeted at fatty  synthesis enzymes. Defective regulation can increase resistance to such inhibitors and also reduce pathogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Zhu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191095>The Effect of Exhaustive Exercise on Plasma  Profiles of Male and Female Rats.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the alteration in biochemical composition and gender difference within exhaustive exercise in male and female rats using a metabolomics strategy.

Similarly, elevated level of AAs (proline, methionine, glutamic  and cysteine) was also observed with the application of GABA (0.5 and 1 mM) in As(III) stressed seedlings. GABA also enhanced the expression of genes involved in the polyamine synthesis pathway namely arginine decarboxylase (AD), spermine (SPM) and spermidine (SPD) synthase against As(III) treatments, which was higher in roots than in shoots, resulting in enhanced root PAs level. Contrarily, the expression of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (S-AMD) was significantly higher in shoots. Among all the PAs, level of putrescine (PUT) was found to be highest with GABA application. Overall, the study demonstrates that GABA (0.5 mM) at lower concentration plays a vital role in As(III) tolerance by enhancing the biosynthesis of USFA, AA and PA, reducing the level of TBARS and HO in rice seedlings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, mung bean seeds were treated with adenosine triphosphate and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). The metabolomic changes during development of mung beans under different energy statuses were investigated. In total, 42 metabolites were identified. Principal component analysis revealed that the featured compounds produced in seeds were , linoleic, and succinic acids. Sugars, including maltose, sucrose, and glucose were related to sprouting. Mung bean seeds utilised diverse energy resources and produced higher succinic  content. Sugars and secondary metabolites accumulated in sprouts. Nitrogen, sugar, and amino    contributed to this physiological process. DNP caused an energy deficit, which resulted in the consumption and translation of glucose. Higher contents of other saccharides and amino acids were observed. The transcriptional results further confirmed our  hypothesis. In conclusion, sufficient energy supply is crucial for sprout development and nutritive metabolite synthesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Dietary fat is a fundamental contributor to obesity and is a risk factor for cancer. Thus far, the impact of dietary olive oil on cancer development remains inconclusive, and little is known about its underlying mechanisms.Nude mouse xenograft models were used to examine the effects of high olive oil diet feeding on cervical cancer (CC) development and progression. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were observed by the methods of EdU incorporation, Wound healing and Transwell assay, separately. RNA-sequencing technology and comprehensive bioinformatics analyses were used to elucidate the molecular processes regulated by dietary fat. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and were functionally analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Enrichment of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Then, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and sub-PPI network analyses were conducted using the STRING database and Cytoscape software.A high olive oil diet aggravated tumourigenesis in an experimental xenograft model of CC. , the main ingredient of olive oil, promoted cell growth and migration in vitro. Transcriptome sequencing analysis of xenograft tumour tissues was then performed to elucidate the regulation of molecular events regulated by dietary fat. Dietary olive oil induced 648 DEGs, comprising 155 up-regulated DEGs and 493 down-regulated DEGs. GO and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that some of the DEGs including EGR1 and FOXN2 were involved in the transcription regulation and others, including TGFB2 and COL4A3 in cell proliferation. The 15 most strongly associated DEGs were selected from the PPI network and hub genes including JUN, TIMP3, OAS1, OASL and EGR1 were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR analysis.Our study suggests that a high olive oil diet aggravates CC progression in vivo and in vitro. We provide clues to build a potential link between dietary fat and cancerogenesis and identify areas requiring further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717220>Effect of Sucrose Ingestion at the End of a Critical Window that Increases Hypertension Susceptibility on Peripheral Mechanisms Regulating Blood Pressure in Rats. Role of Sirtuins 1 and 3.</a></h2><p>Susceptibility to develop hypertension may be established during early stages of life that include the intrauterine period, infancy and childhood. We recently showed that blood pressure increased when rats reached adulthood when sucrose was ingested for a short-term critical window from postnatal day 12 to 28 in the rat, which corresponds to days around weaning. Here, we studied several factors that might participate in the increased susceptibility to hypertension when adulthood is reached by analyzing the changes produced at the end of the sucrose ingestion during this critical period. Body weight of the rats at the end of the sucrose period was decreased even if there was an increased ingestion in Kcal. We found an increase in blood pressure accompanied by a decrease in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in the aorta. When insulin was administered to rats receiving sucrose, glucose in plasma diminished later than in controls and this slight insulin resistance may reduce nitric oxide synthase action.  that modulates eNOS expression was increased, lipoperoxidation was elevated and total non-enzymatic anti-oxidant capacity was decreased. There was also a decrease in SOD2 expression. We also studied the expression of Sirt1, which regulates eNOS expression and Sirt3, which regulates SOD2 expression as possible epigenetic targets of enzyme expression involved in the long- term programming of hypertension. Sirt3 was decreased but we did not find an alteration in Sirt1 expression. We conclude that these changes may underpin the epigenetic programming of increased susceptibility to develop hypertension in the adults when there was exposure to high sucrose levels near weaning in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31330792>Fatty  Profile and Cardiometabolic Markers in Relation with Diet Type and Omega-3 Supplementation in Spanish Vegetarians.</a></h2><p>Plant-based diets are becoming increasingly popular, and scientific information concerning the nutritional status in this population is needed. This study determined the fatty  profile of Spanish lacto-ovo vegetarians (LO-vegetarians) and vegans. Participants were 104 healthy adults, LO-vegetarians ( = 49) and vegans ( = 55). Lifestyle habits and consumption of food and omega-3 supplements were estimated by questionnaires. BMI, blood pressure, and abdominal and body fat were determined. Serum was collected to analyze fatty acids, glucose, lipids, homocysteine, insulin, and leptin. Volunteers were classified according to serum omega-6 to omega-3 (-6/-3) ratio into three groups: -6/-3 < 10, -6/-3 ≥ 10 to 20, and -6/-3 > 20. Results showed low cardiovascular risk and high insulin sensitivity with negligible differences between diet types. Linoleic  (C18:2-6) was the major serum fatty , followed by  (C18:1-9) and palmitic (C16:0) acids. In contrast, serum eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6-3) were (median, interquartile range) 0.27, 0.18% and 1.59, and 0.93%, respectively. Users of -3 supplements (<10% of total vegetarians) had significantly higher EPA than non-users, while frequent consumption of flax-seeds was associated with increased α-linolenic  (C18:3-3). However, neither -3 supplementation nor food consumption affected DHA levels in this vegetarian population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30722880>Enzymatic preparation of structured triacylglycerols with arachidonic and palmitic acids at the sn-2 position for infant formula use.</a></h2><p>Structured TAGs with palmitic  and polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) at the sn-2 position have various health benefits for infants. In this study, we first compared two enzymatic routes for preparation of the structured TAGs. Results showed that the one-pot and two-step syntheses led to 37.6% and 55.4%  incorporation, respectively, after 10 h and reaction route had little effect on the sn-2 fatty  composition. Subsequently, reaction variables of the two-step synthesis were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, 53.5%  was incorporated into the structured TAGs after 6-h acidolysis. Major fatty acids at the sn-2 position were palmitic  (68.7%), ARA (9.8%) and  (7.9%). This is the first study reporting a two-step enzymatic method for structured TAGs preparation. Compared to the one-pot synthesis, current method significantly improves the efficiency of the acidolysis by product inhibition elimination.

Thus, we explored the effects of connexin43 (Cx43) on sepsis-induced intestinal injury in order to provide potential therapeutic strategies. Rat cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) models  and cell models (IEC-6 cells) pretreated with LPS  were used in the current study. Firstly, different methods, such as Cx43 inhibitors (18--GA and oleamide) or siRNA targeting Cx43 and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (a kind of ROS scavenger), were used to observe the effects of Cx43 channels mediating ROS transfer on intestinal injury. Secondly, the influence of ROS content on the activity of the JNK1/Sirt1/FoxO3a signaling pathway was explored through the application of NAC, sp600125 (a JNK1 inhibitor), and nicotinamide (a Sirt1 inhibitor). Finally, luciferase assays and ChIP were used to determine the direct regulation of FoxO3a on proapoptotic proteins, Bim and Puma. The results showed that sepsis-induced intestinal injury presented a dynamic change, coincident with the alternation of Cx43 expression. The inhibition of Cx43 attenuated CLP-induced intestinal injury  and LPS-induced IEC-6 injury . The changes of Cx43 channel function regulated ROS transfer between the neighboring cells, which mediated the activation of the JNK1/Sirt1/FoxO3a signaling pathway. FoxO3a directly affected its downstream target genes, Bim and Puma, which are responsible for cell or tissue apoptosis. In summary, our results suggest that Cx43 inhibition suppresses ROS transfer and inactivates the JNK1/Sirt1/FoxO3a signaling pathway to protect against sepsis-induced intestinal injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31394805>Effects of Olive Oil and Its Minor Components on Cardiovascular Diseases, Inflammation, and Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Olive oil is one of the main ingredients in the Mediterranean diet, being an important ally in disease prevention. Its nutritional composition is comprised of mainly monounsaturated fatty acids, with  being the major , plus minor components which act as effective antioxidants, such as hydroxytyrosol. Studies have shown that the consumption of olive oil, as well as its isolated components or in synergism, can be a primary and secondary protective factor against the development of cardiovascular diseases since it reduces the concentrations of low-density lipoproteins and increases the concentration of high-density lipoproteins. Furthermore, it exerts an influence on the inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor, which are pro-inflammatory agents in the body. The components present in olive oil are also associated with the promotion of intestinal health since they stimulate a higher biodiversity of beneficial gut bacteria, enhancing their balance.

The extraction yield of betacyanins was optimized by response surface methodology. The optimal PHWE conditions were attained and the actual yields of betacyanins under optimal conditions were well matched with the predicted yields. In addition, betacyanin pigment compositions as well as superoxide anion scavenging activity of individual betacyanins extract (BE) produced in optimal PHWE conditions were characterized by HPLC-ESI/MS and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of three BEs on -induced steatohepatitis in cellular model was comparatively investigated. The results showed that unlike PFP, RBS, and CPP presented excellent efficacy in decreasing intracellular triglyceride and reactive oxygen species, inhibiting the release of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase as well as regulating fatty  synthase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 mRNAs expression. Practical applications In this study, PHWE, is firstly proposed for the enhancement of the extraction of betacyanins from three agricultural by-products. Betacyanin-rich extracts by PHWE method exhibit excellent activities in inhibition of ROS and regulation of lipid  in hepatic cells. It suggests that PHWE has a strong potentiality in keeping bioactivity of BEs, which is significant for the production of betacyanins functional foods.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826580>One-pot fabrication of Fe-doped carbon nitride nanoparticles as peroxidase mimetics for HO and glucose detection.</a></h2><p>Iron-doped carbon nitride nanoparticles (Fe-CNNPs) were prepared from citric , urea and ferric chloride through a convenient one-pot solvothermal method.  was used as the reaction medium.

Fatty  oxidation provides energy to renal tubular cells. Ca is required for mitochondrial ATP production and to decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, how nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) affects lipogenesis is unknown. We utilized rat NRK52E cells pre-treated with varying concentrations of nifedipine to examine the activity of lipogenesis enzymes and lipotoxicity.

Daphnetin (DAP) possesses notable antioxidative, anti‑inflammatory and anticoagulant activities; DAP is an active ingredient extracted from Daphne Koreana Nakai. To investigate the effects and the underlying mechanism of DAP on NAFLD, we treated HepG2 cells with  (OA) and DAP simultaneously and non‑simultaneously. In the simultaneous treatment condition, HepG2 cells were co‑treated with 0.5 mM OA and DAP (5, 20, and 50 µM) for 24 h. In the non‑simultaneous treatment conditions, HepG2 cells were pretreated with 0.5 mM OA for 24 h, and then treated with DAP (5, 20 and 50 µM) for 24 h. Following the aforementioned treatments, the biochemical indexes associated with NAFLD were measured as follows: i) The intracellular contents of triglyceride (TG), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and fluorescent glucose 2‑[N‑(7‑nitrobenz‑2‑oxa‑1,3‑diazol‑4‑yl) amino]‑2‑deoxyglucose were analyzed with corresponding detection kits; and ii) the cellular expression levels of glycolipid ‑ and oxidative stress‑related genes, including 5'AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK), sterol regulatory element‑binding protein‑1C (SREBP‑1C), patatin‑like phospholipase domain‑containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor α (PPARα), phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), nuclear factor‑like 2 (Nrf2), cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 and CYP4A were determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The results revealed the potential mechanism underlying the effects of DAP on NAFLD in vitro: i) By increasing the phosphorylation of AMPK, DAP inhibited the expression of SREBP‑1C and PNPLA3, and induced that of PPARα. Lipid accumulation within hepatocytes was reduced; ii) by upregulating PI3K expression and pAKT/AKT levels, DAP may alleviate insulin resistance and promote hepatocellular glucose uptake; and iii) by upregulating the expression of Nrf2, DAP downregulated the expression of CYP2E1 and CYP4A, and the levels of reactive oxygen species in hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340670>Diesel Exhaust Induces Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Hyperlipidemia, and Liver Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as dyslipidemia and  syndrome. Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid  in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty acids 9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate . Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with . As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and  did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction.

This study aimed to assess the molecular mechanism of MO involved in the  (OA)-induced inflammatory damage and lipid accumulation in HepG2 cell and tyloxapol (Ty)-induced hyperlipidemia in mice. We found that MO can efficaciously mitigate reactive tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) level and triglyceride (TG) accumulation in OA-induced HepG2 cell and in tyloxapol-induced mice. Next, the study testified that MO apparently suppressed OA-excited nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling  in HepG2 cell. In addition, MO distinctly upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and decreased the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) in OA-induced HepG2 cell and in tyloxapol-induced mice, both of which are dependent upon the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and protein kinase B (AKT).

However, the molecular mechanism by which NEDD4 gene is transcriptionally regulated has not been fully elucidated. Here, we reported that NEDD4 mRNA and protein levels were increased by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) in HepG2 hepatocytes. PPARγ antagonist GW9662 abolished thiazolidinedione (TZD)-induced NEDD4 expression. ChIP and luciferase reporter assays showed that PPARγ directly bound to the potential PPAR-responsive elements (PPREs) within the promoter region of the human NEDD4 gene. In addition, TZDs increased Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake, which were abrogated through NEDD4 depletion. Furthermore, we showed that NEDD4-mediated autophagy induction and Akt phosphorylation were suppressed by  and high glucose treatment, activation of PPARγ successfully prevented this suppression. In conclusion, these results suggest that PPARγ plays a novel role in linking glucose  and protein homeostasis through NEDD4-mediated effects on the autophagy machinery.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31150977>Seminal plasma metabolome in relation to semen quality and urinary phthalate metabolites among Chinese adult men.</a></h2><p>A growing body of evidence has found links between endocrine disruptor phthalates and male reproductive disorders, but the mechanisms underlying these relationships are poorly known.

In this study, concentrations of fatty  biomarkers in zooplankton were analyzed from the Pearl River, South China between September 2016 and July 2017. The objective was to examine how particulate matter, algae and bacteria food sources affect metal bioaccumulation using fatty  facilitation. In the zooplankton fraction, positive correlations were observed between Pb concentration and Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), Zn and Docosahexaenoic  (DHA) (diatoms and Cryptophyceae biomarkers), Fe with Palmitoleic  (C16:1n-7, diatom marker), and a weak association of Mn with α-linolenic  (C18:3n-3). Cu concentration in the zooplankton increased significantly with an endogenous biotic biomarker Stearic  (C18:0, bacteria biomarker), while Cd concentrations increased with increasing  (C18:1n-9, green alga biomarker) concentration. There was a positive correlation between Cr concentration and the sum of Pentadecylic and Margaric acids (C15:0 + C17:0, bacteria biomarkers). Seven of the nine metals examined showed associations with fatty acids in the zooplankton. The bioaccumulation of Co, Cu, Pb, Fe, Mn and Zn concentration was correlated to the individual biomasses of Brachionus calyciflorus, Filinia longiseta, Schmackeria forbesi, Limnoithona sinenisis, Thermocyclops brevifurcatus, and Diaphanosoma dubium. For selected zooplankton taxa, the algal biomasses of Euglenophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Cryptophyceae, and Bacillariophyceae were correlated. Zooplankton were affected by selected species of phytoplankton and bacteria numbers in the Pearl River. These results show that metal accumulation in zooplankton is not only correlated with diet but is also in part, species specific with metal type. Thus, the bioaccumulation or scavenging of metals across trophic levels is a fundamental and complex component of metal cycling in aquatic environments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

One such factor is the potentially atherogenic effect of lead (Pb) on lipid , and is significant in view of the still considerable Pb environmental pollution and the non-degradability of Pb compounds.Analysis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (caprylic  (C8:0), decanoic  (C10:0), lauric  (C12:0), tridecanoic  (C13:0), myristic  (C14:0), pentadecanoic  (C15:0), palmitic  (C16:0), heptadecanoic  (C17:0), stearic  (C18:0), and behenic  (C22:0)), monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) (palmitoleic  (C16:1),  (18:1w9), trans-vaccenic  (C18:1 trans11)), and polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) (linoleic  (C18:2n6), gamma-linolenic  (C18:3n6), arachidonic  (C20:4n6)), was conducted by gas chromatography. Analysis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) expression was performed using qRT-PCR. Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

However, the role of LDs in fish immunity remains poorly understood. In this study, the function of LDs in the innate immune response of Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells, which are the equivalent of myeloid cells in vertebrates, was investigated. LD number and TG content significantly increased in the CIK cells following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), and polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic  (Poly [I: C]) for 24 h, accompanied by increases in the relative expression of several innate immune genes. However, fatty  compositions of the triglycerides were not changed after treatment with these three pathogenic mimics. LPS, PGN, and Poly (I: C) did not alter the relative expressions of lipogenic (FAS, SCD, and DGAT) and lipid catabolic (PPARα, ATGL, and CPT-1) genes. However, these treatments did increase the mRNA levels of lipid transportation genes (FATP/CD36, ACSL1, and ACSL4), and also decreased the non-esterified fatty  level in the medium. To further explore the role of LDs in the immune response, CIK cells were incubated with different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 μM) of exogenous lipid mix (LM;  [OA]:linoleic  [LA]:linolenic  [LNA] = 2:1:1), and were then transferred to a lipid-free medium and incubated for 24 h. LD size and number increased with the increase in lipid levels, and this was accompanied by increased expression of innate immune genes, including MyD88, IRF3, and IL-1β, which were expressed at their highest levels in 300 μM exogenous lipid mix. Interestingly, after incubating with different fatty acids (LM, OA, LA, LNA, arachidonic  [ARA], and docosahexaenoic  [DHA]; 300 μM), ARA and DHA were more potent in inducing LD formation and innate immune gene expression in the CIK cells. Finally, atglistatin, an ATGL inhibitor, effectively attenuated the expression of most genes upregulated by ARA or DHA, suggesting that lipolysis may be involved in the regulation of immune genes at the transcriptional level. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate that LDs are functional organelles that could act as modulators in the innate immune response of CIK cells. Additionally, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  enriched LDs play a unique role in regulating this process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, the parental and IDH1 (R132H/+) mutant HCT116 cells were treated with various concentrations of  (OA) or palmitic  (PA) in the presence or absence of glucose. The results demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 exacerbated the effects of OA and PA on cell viability and apoptosis, and consistently elevated the production of reactive oxygen species in HCT116 cells, particularly in the absence of glucose. Furthermore, mutation of IDH1 inhibited the rate of fatty  oxidation (FAO), but elevated the glucose consumption in HCT116 cells. The results of immunoblotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) indicated that the expression of glucose transporter 1 was upregulated, whereas that of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 was downregulated in IDH1 mutant HCT116 cells. Although mitochondrial DNA quantification demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 had no effect on the quantity of mitochondria, immunoblotting and RT‑qPCR revealed that mutation of IDH1 in HCT116 cells significantly downregulated the expression of cytochrome c (CYCS) and CYCS oxidase IV, two important components in mitochondrial respiratory chain. These results indicated that mutation of IDH1 aggravated the fatty ‑induced oxidative stress in HCT116 cells, by suppressing FAO and disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The results of the present study may provide novel insight into therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer types with IDH mutation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692006>Short communication: Changes under low ambient temperatures in the milk lipodome and metabolome of mid-lactation cows after dehorning as a calf.</a></h2><p>Horns are living tissue and cows can use their horns for thermoregulatory purposes. We investigated the effect of the presence of horns on the metabolome of milk serum and lipidome of milk fat, to assess the physiological effect of dehorning. Milk sampling took place at low ambient temperatures of -6 to 2°C. Horned and dehorned cows were kept in a mixed herd of Holstein Friesian and Brown Swiss cows. The hypothesis was that horned cows needed to increase their  to compensate for additional heat loss through the presence of their horns. No differences were observed in milk yield, milk solids, and somatic cell counts between horned and dehorned cows. For the milk metabolome, horned cows showed an upregulation of several glucogenic AA that could be transformed into glucose for energy supply and a downregulation of sugar intermediates and γ-glutamylcysteine compared with dehorned cows. The fatty  (FA) composition in horned cows showed a shift toward decreased odd medium-chain FA (C7:0, C9:0, and C11:0) and increased cis-vaccenic  (C18:1n-7 cis-11) and stearidonic  (C18:4n-3). The changes in milk composition related to additional heat loss in horned cows indicate a competition in C3  for glucose synthesis and de novo FA synthesis under cold stress.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

We have isolated the cDNAs encoding three class A microsomal LPAAT2 isoforms from developing flax seeds. The three isoforms, denominated LPAAT2A, LPAAT2A2 and LPAAT2B, are able to complement the LPAAT deficient JC201 E. coli mutant, confirming their functionality. We have performed enzymatic assays showing that the specific activity of the LPAAT2A isoform is significantly higher than that of the LPAAT2A2 and LPAAT2B toward the unsaturated , linoleic and linolenic acids. Moreover, LPAAT2A presents in vitro a high specificity and selectivity for linoleic and linolenic acids as compared to saturated fatty acids. The three isoforms are expressed during all the stages of seed development and in stem and leaf tissues, as shown by an analysis of the transcription level of the corresponding genes. The heterologous expression of LPAAT2A in Arabidopsis seeds leads to an increase in the accumulation of linoleic and linolenic acids in the oil fraction of the seeds from two transgenic lines.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

During two meal challenge test visits subjects received standardized isocaloric (450 kcal) liquid meals: high-carbohydrate (HC, carbohydrates: 89% of energy) and normo-carbohydrate (NC, carbohydrates: 45% of energy). Fasting (0 min) and postprandial (30, 60, 120, 180 min) plasma samples were analyzed for metabolite profiles through untargeted metabolomics.  fingerprinting was performed on an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system connected to an iFunnel quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer.In HR-genotype men, after the intake of an HC-meal, we noted a significantly lower area under the curves (AUCs) of postprandial plasma concentrations of most of the phospholipids (-37% to -53%, variable importance in the projection (VIP) = 1.2-1.5), lysophospholipids (-29% to -86%, VIP = 1.1-2.6), sphingolipids (-32% to -47%, VIP = 1.1-1.3), as well as arachidonic (-36%, VIP = 1.4) and  (-63%, VIP = 1.3) acids, their metabolites: keto- and hydoxy-fatty acids (-38% to -78%, VIP = 1.3-2.5), leukotrienes (-65% to -83%, VIP = 1.4-2.2), uric  (-59%, VIP = 1.5), and pyroglutamic  (-65%, VIP = 1.8). The AUCs of postprandial sphingosine concentrations were higher (125-832%, VIP = 1.9-3.2) after the NC-meal, AUCs of acylcarnitines were lower (-21% to -61%, VIP = 1.1-2.4), and AUCs of fatty  amides were higher (51-508%, VIP = 1.7-3.1) after the intake of both meals.In nondiabetic men carrying the TCF7L2 HR genotype, subtle but detectable modifications in intermediate lipid  are induced by an HC-meal.
