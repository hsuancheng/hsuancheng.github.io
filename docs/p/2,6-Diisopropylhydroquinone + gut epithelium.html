However, little is known about their potential effects on intestinal homeostasis. In this study we examined the effect of some of these food additives on  inflammation.Mice were given drinking water containing maltodextrin (MDX), propylene glycol, or animal gelatin, and then challenged with dextran sulfate sodium or indomethacin. In parallel, mice fed a MDX-enriched diet were given the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). Transcriptomic analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction, mucin- expression, phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase quantification, and H&E staining was performed on colonic tissues. Mucosa-associated microbiota composition was characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. For the in vitro experiments, murine intestinal crypts and the human mucus-secreting HT29-methotrexate treated cell line were stimulated with MDX in the presence or absence of TUDCA or a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor.Diets enriched in MDX, but not propylene glycol or animal gelatin, exacerbated intestinal inflammation in both models. Analysis of the mechanisms underlying the detrimental effect of MDX showed up-regulation of inositol requiring protein 1β, a sensor of ER stress, in goblet cells, and a reduction of mucin- expression with no significant change in mucosa-associated microbiota. Stimulation of murine intestinal crypts and HT29-methotrexate treated cell line cells with MDX induced inositol requiring protein 1β via a p38 MAP kinase-dependent mechanism. Treatment of mice with TUDCA prevented mucin- depletion and attenuated colitis in MDX-fed mice.MDX increases ER stress in  epithelial cells with the downstream effect of reducing mucus production and enhancing colitis susceptibility.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Although many putative EAEC virulence factors have been identified, their association with pathogenesis remains unclear. As environmental cues can modulate bacterial virulence, we investigated the effect of oxygen and human intestinal  on EAEC virulence gene expression to determine the involvement of respective gene products in intestinal colonisation and pathogenesis. Using in vitro organ culture of human intestinal biopsies, we established the colonic  as the major colonisation site of EAEC strains 042 and 17-. We subsequently optimised a vertical diffusion chamber system with polarised T84 colon carcinoma cells for EAEC infection and showed that oxygen induced expression of the global regulator AggR, aggregative adherence fimbriae, E. coli common pilus, EAST-1 toxin, and dispersin in EAEC strain 042 but not in 17-. Furthermore, the presence of T84 epithelia stimulated additional expression of the mucinase Pic and the toxins HlyE and Pet. This induction was dependent on physical host cell contact and did not require AggR. Overall, these findings suggest that EAEC virulence in the human  is modulated by environmental signals including oxygen and the intestinal .© 2019 The Authors Cellular Microbiology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31018888>Role of innate lymphoid cells in allergic diseases.</a></h2><p> Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest and research into understanding the type  immune responses by the -derived cytokines interleukin (IL) 33, IL-25, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin. Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are a unique family of effector immune cells that functionally resemble T cells but lack clonal distributed antigen receptors. Group  ILCs, ILC2s, are known for their capability to secrete proallergic cytokines, including IL-5 and IL-13. ILC2s are enriched at mucosal barriers in lung, , and skin, and their activation has been associated with a variety of allergic disorders.  To study the role of ILC2 in different allergic disorders, including allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies.  A MEDLINE search was performed for articles that reported on ILC2 in allergic disorders, including allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies.  A review of the literature revealed an important role of ILC2 in various allergic disorders.  Identification of ILC2s in patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis indicates that these cells may represent a new therapeutic target. In this review, we discussed the current understanding of ILC2 biology and its function and regulation in various allergic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29597877>EB 2017 Article: Interpretation of the lactulose:mannitol test in rural Malawian children at risk for perturbations in intestinal permeability.</a></h2><p>The dual sugar absorption test, specifically the lactulose:mannitol test, is used to assess  health. Lactulose absorption is said to represent  damage and mannitol absorption is used as a measure of normal small bowel function and serves as normalizing factor for lactulose. A underappreciated limitation of this common understanding of the lactulose:mannitol test is that mannitol is not absorbed to any substantial extent by a transcellular process. Additionally, this interpretation of lactulose:mannitol is not consistent with current understanding of paracellular pathways, where three pathway types exist: pore, leak, and unrestricted. Pore and leak pathways are regulated biological constructions of the small bowel barrier, and unrestricted pathways represent micropathological damage. We analyzed 2334 lactulose:mannitol measurements rigorously collected from 622 young rural Malawian children at high risk for poor  health in light of the pathway model. An alternative method of normalizing for  length utilizing autopsy data is described. In our population, absorbed lactulose and mannitol are strongly correlated, r = 0.68 P <0.0001, suggesting lactulose and mannitol are traversing the  barrier via the same pathways. Considering measurements where pore pathways predominate, mannitol flux is about 14 times that of lactulose. As more leak pathways are present, this differential flux mannitol:lactulose falls to 8:1 and when increased numbers of unrestricted pathways are present, the differential flux of mannitol:lactulose is 6:1. There was no substantial correlation between the lactulose:mannitol and linear growth. Given that mannitol will always pass through a given pathway at a rate at least equal to that of lactulose, and lactulose absorption is a composite measure of flux through both physiologic and pathologic pathways, we question the utility of the lactulose:mannitol test. We suggest using lactulose alone is as informative as lactulose:mannitol in a sugar absorption testing in subclinical  inflammation. Impact statement Our work integrates the standard interpretation of the lactulose:mannitol test (L:M), with mechanistic insight of intestinal permeability. There are three paracellular pathways in the  ; pore, leak, and unrestricted. Using thousands of L:M measurements from rural Malawian children at risk for increased intestinal permeability, we predict the differential flux of L and M through the pathways. Our findings challenge the traditional notions that little L is absorbed through a normal epithelial barrier and that M is a normalizing factor for L. Our observations are consistent with pore pathways allowing only M to pass. And that substantial amounts of L and M pass through leak pathways which are normal, regulated, cell-junctional adaptations. So M is a composite measure of all pathways, and L is not a measure solely of pathologic  damage. Using L alone as a probe will yield more information about  health than L:M.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30291119>A Simple   Model for Studying the Interaction between Escherichia coli and the Intestinal Commensal Microbiota in Cecal Mucus.</a></h2><p>A novel   model was developed to better understand the interactions between  and the mouse cecal mucus commensal microbiota. The  model is simple and inexpensive while providing an environment that largely replicates the nonadherent mucus layer of the mouse cecum. 16S rRNA gene profiling of the cecal microbial communities of streptomycin-treated mice colonized with  MG1655 or  Nissle 1917 and the  model confirmed that the  model properly reflected the community structure of the mouse intestine. Furthermore, the results from the   model mimic the results of published  competitive colonization experiments. The  model is initiated by the colonization of streptomycin-treated mice, and then the community is serially transferred in microcentrifuge tubes in an anaerobic environment generated in anaerobe jars. The nutritional makeup of the cecum is simulated in the  model by using a medium consisting of porcine mucin, mouse cecal mucus, HEPES-Hanks buffer (pH 7.), Cleland's reagent, and agarose. Agarose was found to be essential for maintaining the stability of the microbial community in the  model. The outcome of competitions between  strains in the   model is readily explained by the "restaurant hypothesis" of intestinal colonization. This simple model system potentially can be used to more fully understand how different members of the microbiota interact physically and metabolically during the colonization of the intestinal mucus layer. Both commensal and pathogenic strains of  appear to colonize the mammalian intestine by interacting physically and metabolically with other members of the microbiota in the mucus layer that overlays the cecal and colonic . However, the use of animal models and the complexity of the mammalian  make it difficult to isolate experimental variables that might dictate the interactions between  and other members of the microbiota, such as those that are critical for successful colonization. Here, we describe a simple and relatively inexpensive   model that largely mimics  conditions and therefore can facilitate the manipulation of experimental variables for studying the interactions of  with the intestinal microbiota.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30670931>The Inflammatory Response to Enterotoxigenic  and Probiotic  in a Coculture Model of Porcine Intestinal Epithelial and Dendritic Cells.</a></h2><p>The   constitutes an interface between the intestinal contents and the underlying -associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) including dendritic cells (DC). Interactions of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and resident DC are characterized by bidirectional crosstalk mediated by various factors, such as transforming growth factor- (TGF-) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). In the present study, we aimed (1) to model the interplay of both cell types in a porcine  coculture consisting of IEC (cell line IPEC-J2) and monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) and () to assess whether immune responses to bacteria are altered because of the interplay between IPEC-J2 cells and MoDC. With regard to the latter, we focused on the inflammasome pathway. Here, we propose caspase-13 as a promising candidate for the noncanonical inflammasome activation in pigs. We conducted challenge experiments with enterotoxigenic  (ETEC) and probiotic  () NCIMB 10415. As potential mediators of IEC/DC interactions, TGF- and TSLP were selected for analyses. Cocultured MoDC showed attenuated ETEC-induced inflammasome-related and proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-8 reactions compared with MoDC monocultures. Caspase-13 was more strongly expressed in IPEC-J2 cells cocultured with MoDC and upon ETEC incubation. We found that IPEC-J2 cells and MoDC were capable of releasing TSLP. The latter cells secreted greater amounts of TSLP when cocultured with IPEC-J2 cells. TGF- was not modulated under the present experimental conditions in either cell types. We conclude that, in the presence of IPEC-J2 cells, porcine MoDC exhibited a more tolerogenic phenotype, which might be partially regulated by autocrine TSLP production. Noncanonical inflammasome signaling appeared to be modulated in IPEC-J2 cells. Our results indicate that the reciprocal interplay of the intestinal  and GALT is essential for promoting balanced immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30406837>Isolation and characterisation of mouse intestinal mesoangioblasts.</a></h2><p>Children suffering from intestinal failure (IF) endure considerable morbidity and overall have poor survival rates, complicated by the shortage of organs available for transplantation. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are pivotal if outcomes are to be improved. Over the past years, tissue engineering (TE) has emerged as a possible alternative treatment for many congenital and acquired conditions. TE aims at creating bioengineered organs by means of combining scaffolds with appropriate cell types, which in the intestine are organised within a multilayer structure. In order to generate functional intestine, this cellular diversity and organisation will need to be recreated. While the cells for the epithelial, neural and vascular compartments have been well defined, so far, less attention has been put on the muscular compartment. More recently, mesoangioblasts (MABs) have been identified as a novel source for tissue regeneration since they are able to give rise to vascular and other mesodermal derivatives. To date MABs have not been successfully isolated from intestinal tissue. Therefore, our aim was to demonstrate the possibility of isolating MABs from adult mouse small intestine.All experiments were carried out using small intestinal tissues from C57BL/6J mice. We applied an established protocol for MAB isolation from the isolated neuromuscular layer of the small intestine. Cultured cells were stained for Ki67 to assess proliferation rates as well as for a panel of pericyte markers to determine their phenotype.Cells were successfully isolated from  biopsies. Cultured cells showed good proliferative capacity and positivity for at least three pericytes markers found in vessels of the  neuromuscular wall: neuron-glial antigen , alkaline phosphatase and platelet-derived growth factor β.This proof-of-principle study lays the foundation for further characterization of MABs as a possible cell source for intestinal smooth muscle regeneration and TE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29083773>Anatomy, Abdomen and Pelvis, Small Intestine.</a></h2><p>The small intestine is a crucial component of the digestive system that allows for the breakdown and absorption of important nutrients that permits the body to function at its peak performance. To do this, the small intestine is made up of a complex network of blood vessels, nerves, and muscles that work together to achieve this task. It is a massive organ that has an average length of 3 to 5 meters. It is divided into the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.[1][][3]: The duodenum is the shortest section, on average measuring from 20 cm to 25 cm in length. Its proximal end is connected to the antrum of the stomach, separated by the pylorus. The distal end is at the ligament of Treitz, in which the jejunum begins. The duodenum surrounds the pancreases, in the shape of a "C." It receives chyme from the stomach, pancreatic enzymes, and bile from the liver. The jejunum is roughly .5 meters in length, contains plicae circulares (muscular flaps) and villi to absorb the products of digestion. The ileum comes next, measuring around 3 m, and ends at the cecum. It absorbs any nutrients that got past the jejunum, with major absorptive products being vitamin B12 and bile acids. : Serosa: The serosa is the outside layer of the small intestine and consists mesothelium and , which encircles the jejunum and ileum, and the anterior surface of the duodenum since the posterior side is retroperitoneal. The epithelial cells in the small intestine have a rapid renewal rate, with cells lasting for only 3 to 5 days. Muscularis: The muscularis consists of two smooth muscle layers, a thin outer longitudinal layer that shortens and elongates the , and a thicker inner circular layer of smooth muscle which causes constriction. Nerves lie between these two layers and allow these to muscle layers to work together to propagate food in a proximal to distal direction. Submucosa: The submucosa consists of a layer of connective tissue that contains the blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics.   Mucosa: The mucosa is the innermost layer and is designed for maximal absorption by being covered with villi protruding into the lumen that increases the surface area. The crypt layer of the small bowel that is the area of continual cell renewal and proliferation. Cells move from the crypts to the villi and change into either enterocytes; goblet cells; Paneth cells; or enteroendocrine cells. Of importance is the mesentery, which is a double fold of the peritoneum that not only anchors the small intestines to the back of the abdominal wall, but also contains the blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels that supply the small intestine.[4][5]Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29109448>Identification of claudin-4 binder that attenuates tight junction barrier function by TR-FRET-based screening assay.</a></h2><p>Claudins are key functional and structural components of tight junctions (TJs) in epithelial cell sheets. The C-terminal fragment of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (C-CPE) binds to claudin-4 and reversibly modulates intestinal TJ seals, thereby enhancing paracellular transport of solutes. However, the use of C-CPE as an absorption enhancer is limited by the molecule's immunogenicity and manufacturing cost. Here, we developed a high-throughput screening system based on the Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) method to identify claudin-4 binders in a library collection of 32,560 compounds. Thiostrepton, identified from the screen, decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and increased flux of 4-kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled dextran (FD-4) in Caco- cell monolayers, a model of intestinal . Thiostrepton changed the expression, but not the localisation, of TJ components. Treatment of rat jejunum with thiostrepton increased the absorption of FD-4 without tissue toxicity, indicating that thiostrepton is a novel claudin-4 binder that enhances intestinal permeability. The screening system may therefore be a useful tool for identifying claudin-4 binders to enhance drug absorption in mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29934438> GG protects the intestinal  from radiation injury through release of lipoteichoic acid, macrophage activation and the migration of mesenchymal stem cells.</a></h2><p> GG (LGG), a probiotic, given by gavage is radioprotective of the mouse intestine. LGG-induced radioprotection is toll-like receptor  (TLR2) and cyclooxygenase- (COX-)-dependent and is associated with the migration of COX-+mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the lamina propria of the villus to the lamina propria near the crypt epithelial stem cells. Our goals were to define the mechanism of LGG radioprotection including identification of the TLR2 agonist, and the mechanism of the MSC migration and to determine the safety and efficacy of this approach in models relevant to clinical radiation therapy.Intestinal radioprotection was modelled in vitro with cell lines and enteroids as well as in vivo by assaying clinical outcomes and crypt survival. Fractionated abdominal and single dose radiation were used along with syngeneic CT26 colon tumour grafts to assess tumour radioprotection.LGG with a mutation in the processing of lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a TLR2 agonist, was not radioprotective, while LTA agonist and native LGG were. An agonist of CXCR4 blocked LGG-induced MSC migration and LGG-induced radioprotection. LGG given by gavage induced expression of CXCL12, a CXCR4 agonist, in pericryptal macrophages and depletion of macrophages by clodronate liposomes blocked LGG-induced MSC migration and radioprotection. LTA effectively protected the normal intestinal crypt, but not tumours in fractionated radiation regimens.LGG acts as a 'time-release capsule' releasing radioprotective LTA. LTA then primes the epithelial stem cell niche to protect epithelial stem cells by triggering a multicellular, adaptive immune signalling cascade involving macrophages and PGE2 secreting MSCs.; Pre-results.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2019.

Human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) that are derived from intestinal crypt stem cells are biologically relevant in an in vitro model of the intestinal . HIEs contain all intestinal epithelial cell types; however, similar to the intestine, HIEs spontaneously produce few EECs, which limits their study.To increase the number of EECs in HIEs, we used lentivirus transduction to stably engineer jejunal HIEs with doxycycline-inducible expression of neurogenin-3 (NGN3), a transcription factor that drives EEC differentiation (tetNGN3-HIEs). We examined the impact of NGN3 induction on EECs by quantifying the increase in the enterochromaffin cells and other EEC subtypes. We functionally assessed secretion of serotonin and EEC hormones in response to norepinephrine and rotavirus infection.Treating tetNGN3-HIEs with doxycycline induced a dose-dependent increase of chromogranin A (ChgA)-positive and serotonin-positive cells, showing increased enterochromaffin cell differentiation. Despite increased ChgA-positive cells, other differentiated cell types of the  remained largely unchanged by gene expression and immunostaining. RNA sequencing of doxycycline-induced tetNGN3-HIEs identified increased expression of key hormones and enzymes associated with several other EEC subtypes. Doxycycline-induced tetNGN3-HIEs secreted serotonin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, peptide YY, and ghrelin in response to norepinephrine and rotavirus infection, further supporting the presence of multiple EEC types.We have combined HIEs and inducible-NGN3 expression to establish a flexible in vitro model system for functional studies of EECs in enteroids and advance the molecular and physiological investigation of EECs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We hypothesized that the increased burden of intracellular commensal bacteria would activate the enterocyte, with the potential to promote inflammation. Treatment of human colon-derived epithelial cell lines in vitro with dinitrophenol (DNP) and commensal E. coli (strains F18, HB101) provoked increased production of interleukin (IL-8), which was not observed with conditioned medium from the bacteria, lipopolysaccharide or inert beads. The IL-8 response was inhibited by co-treatment with cytochalasin-D (blocks F-actin rearrangement), chloroquine (blocks phagosome acidification) and a MyD88 inhibitor (blocks TLR signaling), consistent with TLR-signaling mediating IL-8 synthesis subsequent to bacterial internalization. Use of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, mitoTEMPO, or U0126 to block ERK1/ MAPK signalling inhibited DNP+E. coli-evoked IL-8 production. Mutations in the NOD2 (the intracellular sensor of bacteria) or ATG16L1 (autophagy protein) genes are susceptibility traits for Crohn's, and epithelia lacking either protein displayed enhanced IL-8 production in comparison to wild-type cells when exposed to DNP + E coli. Thus, metabolic stress perturbs the normal epithelial-bacterial interaction resulting in increased IL-8 production due to uptake of bacteria into the enterocyte: this potentially pro-inflammatory event is enhanced in cells lacking NOD2 or ATG16L1 that favor increased survival of bacteria within the enterocyte. We speculate that by increasing epithelial permeability and IL-8 production, reduced mitochondria function in the enteric  would contribute to the initiation, pathophysiology, and reactivation of inflammatory disease in the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31325218>Oral delivery of pancreatitis-associated protein by Lactococcus lactis displays protective effects in dinitro-benzenesulfonic-acid-induced colitis model and is able to modulate the composition of the microbiota.</a></h2><p>Antimicrobial peptides secreted by intestinal immune and epithelial cells are important effectors of innate immunity. They play an essential role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis by limiting microbial  interactions and preventing unnecessary microbe-driven inflammation. Pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) belongs to Regenerating islet-derived III proteins family and is a C-type (Ca dependent) lectin. PAP protein plays a protective effect presenting anti-inflammatory properties able to reduce the severity of colitis, preserving  barrier and epithelial inflammation. Here, we sought to determine whether PAP delivered at intestinal lumen by recombinant Lactococcus lactis strain (LL-PAP) before and after chemically induced colitis is able to reduce the severity in two models of colitis. After construction and characterization of our recombinant strains, we tested their effects in dinitro-benzenesulfonic-acid (DNBS) and Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis model. After the DNBS challenge, mice treated with LL-PAP presented less severe colitis compared with PBS and LL-empty-treated mice groups. After the DSS challenge, no protective effects of LL-PAP could be detected. We determined that after 5 days administration, LL-PAP increase butyrate producer's bacteria, especially Eubacterium plexicaudatum. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that a treatment with LL-PAP shifts the microbiota preventing the severity of colon inflammation in DNBS colitis model.

The human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco- was also analyzed in vitro for the effects of ethanol on the barrier function (transepithelial electrical resistance), occludin localization (immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blotting), and endocytosis pathways (double-labeling immunofluorescence microscopy with selective pathway inhibitors).The ethanol-fed mice developed steatohepatitis and displayed intestinal barrier dysfunction, the disruption of intestinal TJ, and enhanced intestinal endocytosis of occluding compared with the control mice. In the Caco- monolayers, ethanol treatment decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, disrupted TJ formation, and enhanced occludin endocytosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These deleterious events were reversed by pretreating the Caco- cells with a selective pharmacological inhibitor of macropinocytosis, but not with the inhibitors of clathrin or caveolin-mediated endocytic pathways.Chronic ethanol exposure may increase intestinal permeability by inducing the micropinocytosis of occludin, resulting in the disruption of intestinal TJ.© 2019 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534167>Non-hematopoietic STAT6 induces epithelial tight junction dysfunction and promotes intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Enhanced  permeability due to dysregulated epithelial tight junction is often associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which have a greater risk for developing colorectal cancer. STAT6 activation was detected in inflamed colonic  of active IBD patients, suggesting a role of epithelial STAT6 in colitis development. Here, we demonstrated that non-hematopoietic STAT6, but not hematopoietic STAT6, triggered DSS-induced colitis and subsequent tumorigenesis. This could be due to the enhancing-effect of STAT6 on  permeability and microbiota translocation via interruption of epithelial tight junction integrity. Mechanistically, long-myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK1) was identified as a target of STAT6, leading to epithelial tight junction dysfunction and microbiota-driven colitis. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-13, which was primarily derived from type  innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in a microbiota-dependent way, inhibited epithelial STAT6 activation and improved  permeability and DSS-induced colitis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT6 reduces murine intestinal tumor formation, and tumoral p-STAT6 levels positively correlated to the clinical stage and poor prognosis of human colorectal cancer. Thus, our study reveals a direct role of STAT6 in the disruption of epithelial tight junction integrity and colitis development, and suggests STAT6 as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic target for IBD and colitis-associated cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30072985>Polymeric Immunoglobulin Receptor Mediates Immune Excretion of Mucosal IgM-Antigen Complexes Across Intestinal  in Flounder ().</a></h2><p>Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) is one important player of mucosal defenses, but very little is known on pIgR-mediated immune excretion of the antigens that penetrate mucosal surface in fish. Previously, we cloned the pIgR of flounder () and developed anti-pIgR antibody. In this study, the flounders were immunized intraperitoneally with the chicken ovalbumin (OVA) and the control protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) to elicit mucosal IgM antibody and pIgR response, and then challenged with OVA  caudal vein injection after the immunized OVA was absent from fish body at the fourth week after immunization. After OVA challenge, strong OVA-positive fluorescence signals were observed in lamina propria (LP) submucosa and epithelial cells of the hindgut at 30 min, increased proceeding toward the distal portion of intestinal folds, reached a peak at -3 h, and then weakened and disappeared at 12 h, indicating that the OVA rapidly diffused from bloodstream into LP submucosa and excreted across intestinal . Whereas in BSA-immunized and OVA-challenged control fish, the OVA was detected in LP submucosa but not in intestinal  due to the lack of OVA-specific antibody. Accordingly, in intestinal , the transepithelial transport of OVA was confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy, and co-localization of OVA, IgM, and pIgR was illuminated by multiple-label immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and analyzed using Image J software. Furthermore, in  mucus but not in serum, an ~800-kDa protein band showed IgM-positive, OVA-positive, and pIgR-positive simultaneously, and the OVA, together with IgM and secretory component (SC) of pIgR, could be immunoprecipitated by anti-OVA antibody, demonstrating the existence of SC-polymeric IgM-OVA complexes. All these results collectively revealed that the pIgR could transport mucosal IgM-OVA complexes from LP across intestinal  into  mucus  the transcytosis in flounder.

Baseline FD-4 concentration was similar between WT and Fabpl-Bcl- mice. Intestinal permeability increased 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours following sepsis in WT mice; however, FD-4 concentration was significantly lower at each timepoint in Fabpl-Bcl- mice. In addition, there were no statistically significant changes in permeability between septic and sham transgenic mice. Intestinal mRNA expression of claudin 3, claudin 5 and occludin were lower in septic Fabpl-Bcl- mice while claudin 4 mRNA levels were higher in Fabpl-Bcl- mice. In contrast, no differences were detected in claudins , 7, 15, JAM-A or ZO-1. Protein levels followed the same trend for all tight junction mediators different between WT and Fabpl-Bcl- mice except occludin was significantly higher in transgenic mice. Together these results demonstrate that decreasing intestinal epithelial apoptosis prevents hyperpermeability following sepsis via tight junction alterations which may be at least partially responsible for improved survival conferred by Bcl- overexpression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29389636>Simulated gastrointestinal conditions increase adhesion ability of Lactobacillus paracasei strains isolated from kefir to Caco- cells and mucin.</a></h2><p>Gastrointestinal conditions along the digestive tract are the main stress to which probiotics administrated orally are exposed because they must survive these adverse conditions and arrive alive to the intestine. Adhesion to  has been considered one of the key criteria for the characterization of probiotics because it extends their residence time in the intestine and as a consequence, can influence the health of the host by modifying the local microbiota or modulating the immune response. Nevertheless, there are very few reports on the adhesion properties to  and mucus of microorganisms after passing through the gastrointestinal tract. In the present work, we evaluate the adhesion ability in vitro of L. paracasei strains isolated from kefir grains after acid and bile stress and we observed that they survive simulated gastrointestinal passage in different levels depending on the strain. L. paracasei CIDCA 8339, 83120 and 83123 were more resistant than L. paracasei CIDCA 83121 and 83124, with a higher susceptibility to simulated gastric conditions. Proteomic analysis of L. paracasei subjected to acid and bile stress revealed that most of the proteins that were positively regulated correspond to the glycolytic pathway enzymes, with an overall effect of stress on the activation of the energy source. Moreover, it is worth to remark that after gastrointestinal passage, L. paracasei strains have increased their ability to adhere to mucin and epithelial cells in vitro being this factor of relevance for maintenance of the strain in the  environment to exert its probiotic action.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The incidence of IBD is increasing, with more cases occurring in developed countries. Multiple factors such as genetics, environmental changes,  microbiota, and immune abnormalities have been associated with development of IBD. In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that epigenetic modifications of chromatin and the manner in which chromatin is organized in the nucleus are additionally important elements that can influence responses induced by the factors described above, and may therefore contribute to the onset and pathogenesis of IBD. Epigenetics and chromatin organization regulate diverse functions that include maintenance of homeostasis in the intestinal , the development and differentiation of immune cells, and modulation of responses generated by the immune system to defend against potential pathogens. Furthermore, changes in epigenetic chromatin marks and in chromatin organization have now been linked to differential gene expression in IBD patient cells. Although direct evidence for a role of histone modifications in IBD is currently very limited, in this review, we summarize the links between various epigenetic modifications, the proteins that catalyze or recognize these modifications, and the development or progression of IBD in human and experimental IBD. We also discuss how epigenetics influence the organization of DNA contacts to regulate gene expression and the implications this may have for diagnosing and treating IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29056165>The Leaky  and Altered Microbiome in Chronic Kidney Disease.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease results in disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier as well as profound changes in the  microbial flora. These events are largely mediated by (1) heavy influx of circulating urea to the  lumen and () dietary restrictions of foods containing high fiber (such as fruits and vegetable) and symbiotic organisms (such as yogurt and cheese) imposed to mitigate hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. Collectively, these factors promote systemic inflammation and cardiovascular morbidity by mediating microbial dysbiosis, disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier, and translocation of endotoxin, bacterial fragments, and uremic toxins across the "leaky " into the bloodstream. Strategies aimed at increasing dietary fiber and lowering urea burden may help to attenuate uremia-induced microbial dysbiosis and epithelial barrier breakdown, and thereby improve systemic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

In amniotes the mouth and nares are the only channels allowing direct contact between internal and external epithelia. In teleost fish, gill slits arise through opening of endodermal pouches and connect the pharynx to the exterior. Using transgenic zebrafish lines, cell tracing, live imaging and different markers, we investigated if pharyngeal openings enable epithelial invasion and how this modifies the pharyngeal . We conclude that in zebrafish the pharyngeal endoderm becomes overlain by cells with a peridermal phenotype. In a wave starting from pouch , peridermal cells from the outer skin layer invade the successive pouches until halfway their depth. Here the peridermal cells connect to a population of cells inside the pharyngeal cavity that express periderm markers, yet do not invade from outside. The latter population expands along the midline from anterior to posterior until the esophagus- boundary.

The effects of feeding on metabolism (oxygen consumption rate),  mass and morphology ( somatic index,   mucosal thickness), and digestive function (maltase and peptidase activity) were examined in the New Zealand hagfish, Eptatretus cirrhatus. The influence of post-prandial hypoxia on oxygen consumption rate was also investigated to replicate the immersive feeding environment. Fed hagfish displayed a 1.9-fold increase in peak oxygen consumption relative to sham controls. This elevation in post-prandial oxygen consumption continued for 72 h, during which the energy cost of digesting the meal (specific dynamic action; SDA) was .1 kJ. Oxygen consumption rate increased when the post-prandial environment was hypoxic, a response suggesting a lack of hypoxia tolerance in this species. Feeding did not alter  somatic index (percentage of digesta-free  mass to whole body mass), but there was an increase in the mucosal thickness of the  . Maltase activity in the  was unchanged by feeding, but the activity of  peptidases was increased significantly, consistent with a protein-based diet. These data indicate that some postprandial responses of New Zealand hagfish are similar in nature to those seen in other animals, but this species does not exhibit the extreme post-prandial physiological and biochemical changes that are observed in other intermittently-feeding vertebrates.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

During its life cycle L. pyrrhocoris never tightly attaches to the  of the insect . In contrast, its dixenous relatives (Leishmania spp.) establish a stable infection via attachment to the intestinal walls of their insect hosts.This process is mediated by chemical modifications of the cell surface lipophosphoglycans. In our study we tested whether the inability of L. pyrrhocoris to attach to the firebug's midgut is associated with the absence of these glycoconjugates. We also analyzed evolution of the proteins involved in proper lipophosphoglycan assembly, cell attachment and establishment of a stable infection in L. pyrrhocoris, L. seymouri, and Leishmania spp. Our comparative analysis demonstrated differences in SCG/L/R repertoire between the two parasite subgenera, Leishmania and Viannia, which may be related to distinct life strategies in various Leishmania spp. The genome of L. pyrrhocoris encodes 6 SCG genes, all of which are quite divergent from their orthologs in the genus Leishmania. Using direct probing with an antibody recognizing the β-Gal side chains of lipophosphoglycans, we confirmed that these structures are not synthesized in L. pyrrhocoris.We conclude that either the SCG enzymes are not active in this species (similarly to SCG5/7 in L. major), or they possess a different biochemical activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29632078>Regulation of Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Function by Long Noncoding RNA  through Interaction with MicroRNA 29b.</a></h2><p>The mammalian intestinal  establishes a selectively permeable barrier that supports nutrient absorption and prevents intrusion by noxious luminal substances and microbiota.

Dysbiosis of the  microbiota associated with increased intestinal permeability facilitates the passage of endotoxins and other microbial products, including indoxyl sulfate in the circulation. Although an emerging body of evidence has suggested that indoxyl sulfate is a key substance for the development of chronic kidney disease, few studies have investigated the direct association of indoxyl sulfate with vascular function. We hypothesized that indoxyl sulfate adversely affects vascular function. Aortas isolated from male Wistar rat were examined in the presence or absence of indoxyl sulfate to assess the vascular function, including vasorelaxation and vasocontraction. Indoxyl sulfate (vs. vehicle) (1) decreased vasorelaxation induced by acetylcholine (ACh) but not by sodium nitroprusside; () had no significant alterations of noradrenaline-induced vasocontraction in the absence and presence of endothelium; (3) decreased adenylyl cyclase activator (forskolin)-induced vasorelaxation, while such a difference was eliminated by endothelial denudation; and (4) decreased vasorelaxations induced by calcium ionophore (A23187) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 agonist (GSK1016790A). The indoxyl sulfate-induced decrease in the vasorelaxations induced by ACh and A23187 increased by cell-permeant superoxide dismutase or by organic anion transporter inhibitor. However, apocynin, an inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, had no effects on vasorelaxations induced by ACh, A23187, forskolin, and GSK1016790A in the presence of indoxyl sulfate. These results suggest that indoxyl sulfate directly affects the vascular function, particularly, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, and this effect may be attributable to increased oxidative stress after cell transportion via organic anion transporter, and such increased oxidative stress may not be attributable to activation of NADPH oxidase activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712787>Identification and characterization of an M cell marker in nasopharynx- and oropharynx-associated lymphoid tissue of sheep.</a></h2><p>M cells play a pivotal role in the induction of immune responses within the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues.

Our objectives were to study gliadin absorption with and without cofactors and to correlate plasma gliadin levels with factors influencing protein absorption in healthy volunteers.Twelve healthy probands (six males, six females; aged 20-56 years) ingested 32 g of gluten without any cofactor or in combination with cofactors aerobic and anaerobic exercise, ASA, alcohol and pantoprazole. Gliadin serum levels were measured up to 120 min afterwards and the intestinal barrier function protein zonulin in stool was collected before and after the procedure; both were measured by ELISA. Stool microbiota profile was obtained by 16S gene sequencing.Within 15 min after gluten intake, gliadin concentrations in blood serum increased from baseline in all subjects reaching highly variable peak levels after 15-90 min. Addition of cofactors did not lead to substantially higher gliadin levels, although variability of levels was higher with differences between individuals (p < 0.001) and increased levels at later time points. Zonulin levels in stool were associated neither with addition of cofactors nor with peak gliadin concentrations. There were no differences in  microbiota between the different interventions, although the composition of microbiota (p < 0.001) and the redundancy discriminant analysis (p < 0.007) differed in probands with low versus high stool zonulin levels.The adsorption of gliadin in the  in healthy volunteers is less dependent on cofactors than has been hypothesized. Patients with WDEIA may have a predisposition needed for the additional effect of cofactors, e.g., hyperresponsive or damaged intestinal . Alternatively, other mechanisms, such as cofactor-induced blood flow redistribution, increased activity of tissue transglutaminase, or increases in plasma osmolality and acidosis inducing basophil and mast cell histamine release may play the major role in WDEIA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813280>Cellular and Molecular Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Focusing on Intestinal Barrier Function.</a></h2><p>The human  relies on several cellular and molecular mechanisms to allow for an intact and dynamical intestinal barrier. Normally, only small amounts of luminal content pass the mucosa, however, if the control is broken it can lead to enhanced passage, which might damage the mucosa, leading to pathological conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is well established that genetic, environmental, and immunological factors all contribute in the pathogenesis of IBD, and a disturbed intestinal barrier function has become a hallmark of the disease. Genetical studies support the involvement of intestinal barrier as several susceptibility genes for IBD encode proteins with key functions in  barrier and homeostasis. IBD patients are associated with loss in bacterial diversity and shifts in the microbiota, with a possible link to local inflammation. Furthermore, alterations of immune cells and several neuro-immune signaling pathways in the lamina propria have been demonstrated. An inappropriate immune activation might lead to mucosal inflammation, with elevated secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can affect the  and promote a leakier barrier. This review will focus on the main cells and molecular mechanisms in IBD and how these can be targeted in order to improve intestinal barrier function and reduce inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604999>Small molecule FAK activator promotes human intestinal epithelial monolayer wound closure and mouse ulcer healing.</a></h2><p>GI mucosal healing requires epithelial sheet migration. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK) stimulates epithelial motility. A virtual screen identified the small drug-like FAK mimic ZINC40099027, which activates FAK. We assessed whether ZINC40099027 promotes FAK-Tyr-397 phosphorylation and wound healing in Caco- monolayers and two mouse intestinal injury models. Murine small bowel ulcers were generated by topical serosal acetic acid or subcutaneous indomethacin in C57BL/6J mice. One day later, we began treatment with ZINC40099027 or DMSO, staining the mucosa for phosphorylated FAK and Ki-67 and measuring mucosal ulcer area, serum creatinine, ALT, and body weight at day 4. ZINC40099027 (10-1000 nM) dose-dependently activated FAK phosphorylation, without activating Pyk2-Tyr-402 or Src-Tyr-419. ZINC40099027 did not stimulate proliferation, and stimulated wound closure independently of proliferation. The FAK inhibitor PF-573228 prevented ZINC40099027-stimulated wound closure. In both mouse ulcer models, ZINC40099027accelerated mucosal wound healing. FAK phosphorylation was increased in jejunal  at the ulcer edge, and Ki-67 staining was unchanged in jejunal mucosa. ZINC40099027 serum concentration at sacrifice resembled the effective concentration in vitro. Weight, creatinine and ALT did not differ between groups. Small molecule FAK activators can specifically promote epithelial restitution and mucosal healing and may be useful to treat  mucosal injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29330471>SLC26A3 (DRA) prevents TNF-alpha-induced barrier dysfunction and dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute colitis.</a></h2><p>SLC26A3 encodes a Cl/HCO ion transporter that is also known as downregulated in adenoma (DRA) and is involved in HCO/mucus formation. The role of DRA in the epithelial barrier has not been previously established. In this study, we investigated the in vivo and in vitro mechanisms of DRA in the colon epithelial barrier. Immunofluorescence (IF) and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies reveal that DRA binds directly to tight junction (TJ) proteins and affects the expression of TJ proteins in polarized Caco-2BBe cells. Similarly, DRA colocalizes with ZO-1 in the intestinal . Knockdown or overexpression of DRA leads to alterations in TJ proteins and epithelial permeability. In addition, TNF-α treatment downregulates DRA by activating NF-кB and subsequently affecting intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Furthermore, overexpression of DRA partly reverses the TNF-α-induced damage by stabilizing TJ proteins. Neutralization of TNF-α in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice demonstrates improved the outcomes, and the therapeutic effect of the TNF-α neutralizing mAb is mediated in part by the preservation of DRA expression. These data suggest that DRA may be one of the therapeutic targets of TNF-α. Moreover, DRA delivered by adenovirus vector significantly prevents the exacerbation of colitis and improves epithelial barrier function by promoting the recovery of TJ proteins in DSS-treated mice. In conclusion, DRA plays a role in protecting the epithelial barrier and may be a therapeutic target in  homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31486062>Innervation and nerve-immune cell contacts in mouse Peyer's patches.</a></h2><p>Neural regulation of the function of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) relies on a delicate balance of the two divisions of its nervous system, namely, the intrinsic and extrinsic divisions. The intrinsic innervation is provided by the enteric nervous system (ENS), whereas the extrinsic innervation includes sympathetic/parasympathetic nerve fibers and extrinsic sensory nerve fibers. In the present study, we used immunofluorescent staining of neurofilament-heavy (NF-H) to reveal the distribution of nerve fibers and their associations with immune cells inside mouse Peyer's patches (PP), an essential part of -associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Our results demonstrate (1) the presence of an extensive meshwork of NF-H-immunoreactive presumptive nerve fibers in all PP compartments including the lymphoid nodules, interfollicular region, follicle-associated , and subepithelial dome; () close associations/contacts of nerve fibers with blood vessels including high endothelial venules, indicating neural control of blood flow and immune cell dynamics inside the PP; (3) close contacts between nerve fibers/endings and B/T cells and various subsets of dendritic cells ( e.g., B220-, B220+, CD4-, CD4+, CD8-, and CD8+). Our novel findings concerning PP innervation and nerve-immune-cell contacts in situ should facilitate our understanding of bi-directional communications between the PNS and GALT. Since the innervation of the , including PP, might be important in the pathogenesis and progression of some neurological, infectious, and autoimmune diseases, e.g., prion diseases and inflammatory bowel disease, better knowledge of PNS-immune system interactions in the GALT (including PP) should benefit the development of potential treatments for these diseases via neuroimmune manipulations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29944342>Laser Ablation as a Versatile Tool To Mimic Polyethylene Terephthalate Nanoplastic Pollutants: Characterization and Toxicology Assessment.</a></h2><p>The presence of micro- and nanoplastics in the marine environment is raising strong concerns since they can possibly have a negative impact on human health. In particular, the lack of appropriate methodologies to collect the nanoplastics from water systems imposes the use of engineered model nanoparticles to explore their interactions with biological systems, with results not easily correlated with the real case conditions. In this work, we propose a reliable top-down approach based on laser ablation of polymers to form polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nanoplastics, which mimic real environmental nanopollutants, unlike synthetic samples obtained by colloidal chemistry. PET nanoparticles were carefully characterized in terms of chemical/physical properties and stability in different media. The nanoplastics have a ca. 100 nm average dimension, with significant size and shape heterogeneity, and they present weak acid groups on their surface, similarly to photodegraded PET plastics. Despite no toxic effects emerging by in vitro studies on human Caco- intestinal epithelial cells, the formed nanoplastics were largely internalized in endolysosomes, showing intracellular biopersistence and long-term stability in a simulated lysosomal environment. Interestingly, when tested on a model of intestinal , nano-PET showed high propensity to cross the  barrier, with unpredictable long-term effects on health and potential transport of dispersed chemicals mediated by the nanopollutants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510170>Clostridium difficile toxins induce VEGF-A and vascular permeability to promote disease pathogenesis.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is mediated by two major exotoxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), that damage the colonic epithelial barrier and induce inflammatory responses. The function of the colonic vascular barrier during CDI has been relatively understudied. Here we report increased colonic vascular permeability in CDI mice and elevated vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), which was induced in vivo by infection with TcdA- and/or TcdB-producing C. difficile strains but not with a TcdATcdB isogenic mutant. TcdA or TcdB also induced the expression of VEGF-A in human colonic mucosal biopsies. Hypoxia-inducible factor signalling appeared to mediate toxin-induced VEGF production in colonocytes, which can further stimulate human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells. Both neutralization of VEGF-A and inhibition of its signalling pathway attenuated CDI in vivo. Compared to healthy controls, CDI patients had significantly higher serum VEGF-A that subsequently decreased after treatment. Our findings indicate critical roles for toxin-induced VEGF-A and colonic vascular permeability in CDI pathogenesis and may also point to the pathophysiological significance of the  vascular barrier in response to virulence factors of enteric pathogens. As an alternative to pathogen-targeted therapy, this study may enable new host-directed therapeutic approaches for severe, refractory CDI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133850>Nanofibrous Scaffolds Support a 3D  Permeability Model of the Human Intestinal .</a></h2><p>Advances in drug research not only depend on high throughput screening to evaluate large numbers of lead compounds but also on the development of  models which can simulate human tissues in terms of drug permeability and functions. Potential failures, such as poor permeability or interaction with efflux drug transporters, can be identified in epithelial Caco- monolayer models and can impact a drug candidate's progression onto the next stages of the drug development process. Whilst monolayer models demonstrate reasonably good prediction of  permeability for some compounds, more developed  tools are needed to assess new entities that enable closer  correlation. In this study, an  model of the human intestinal  was developed by utilizing nanofibers, fabricated using electrospinning, to mimic the structure of the basement membrane. We assessed Caco- cell response to these materials and investigated the physiological properties of these cells cultured on the fibrous supports, focusing on barrier integrity and drug-permeability properties. The obtained data illustrate that 2D Caco- Transwell cultures exhibit artificially high trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) compared to cells cultured on the 3D nanofibrous scaffolds which show TEER values similar to  porcine tissue (also measured in this study). Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the 3D nanofibrous scaffolds influence the barrier integrity of the Caco- monolayer to confer drug-absorption properties that more closely mimic native  tissue particularly for studying passive epithelial transport. We propose that this 3D model is a suitable  model for investigating drug absorption and intestinal metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31084433>Vitamin A and vitamin D regulate the microbial complexity, barrier function, and the mucosal immune responses to ensure intestinal homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Diet is an important regulator of the gastrointestinal microbiota. Vitamin A and vitamin D deficiencies result in less diverse, dysbiotic microbial communities and increased susceptibility to infection or injury of the gastrointestinal tract. The vitamin A and vitamin D receptors are nuclear receptors expressed by the host, but not the microbiota. Vitamin A- and vitamin D-mediated regulation of the intestinal  and mucosal immune cells underlies the effects of these nutrients on the microbiota. Vitamin A and vitamin D regulate the expression of tight junction proteins on intestinal epithelial cells that are critical for barrier function in the . Other shared functions of vitamin A and vitamin D include the support of innate lymphoid cells that produce IL-22, suppression of IFN-γ and IL-17 by T cells, and induction of regulatory T cells in the mucosal tissues. There are some unique functions of vitamin A and D; for example, vitamin A induces  homing receptors on T cells, while vitamin D suppresses  homing receptors on T cells.

However, whether pharyngeal pouch progenitors exist in the developing  tube remains unknown. Here, taking advantage of cell lineage tracing and transgenic ablation technologies, we identified a population of nkx2.3+ pouch progenitors in zebrafish embryos and demonstrated an essential requirement of ectodermal BMP2b for their specification. At early somite stages, nkx2.3+ cells located at lateral region of pharyngeal endoderm give rise to the pouch  except a subpopulation expressing pdgfαa rather than nkx2.3. A small-scale screen of chemical inhibitors reveals that BMP signaling is necessary to specify these progenitors. Loss-of-function analyses show that BMP2b, expressed in the pharyngeal ectoderm, actives Smad effectors in endodermal cells to induce nkx2.3+ progenitors. Collectively, our study provides in vivo evidence for the existence of pouch progenitors and highlights the importance of BMP2b signaling in progenitor specification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29871918>Candida albicans-Induced Epithelial Damage Mediates Translocation through Intestinal Barriers.</a></h2><p>Life-threatening systemic infections often occur due to the translocation of pathogens across the  barrier and into the bloodstream. While the microbial and host mechanisms permitting bacterial  translocation are well characterized, these mechanisms are still unclear for fungal pathogens such as , a leading cause of nosocomial fungal bloodstream infections. In this study, we dissected the cellular mechanisms of translocation of  across intestinal epithelia  and identified fungal genes associated with this process. We show that fungal translocation is a dynamic process initiated by invasion and followed by cellular damage and loss of epithelial integrity. A screen of >,000  deletion mutants identified genes required for cellular damage of and translocation across enterocytes. Correlation analysis suggests that hypha formation, barrier damage above a minimum threshold level, and a decreased epithelial integrity are required for efficient fungal translocation. Translocation occurs predominantly via a transcellular route, which is associated with fungus-induced necrotic epithelial damage, but not apoptotic cell death. The cytolytic peptide toxin of , candidalysin, was found to be essential for damage of enterocytes and was a key factor in subsequent fungal translocation, suggesting that transcellular translocation of  through intestinal layers is mediated by candidalysin. However, fungal invasion and low-level translocation can also occur via non-transcellular routes in a candidalysin-independent manner. This is the first study showing translocation of a human-pathogenic fungus across the intestinal barrier being mediated by a peptide toxin., usually a harmless fungus colonizing human mucosae, can cause lethal bloodstream infections when it manages to translocate across the intestinal . This can result from antibiotic treatment, immune dysfunction, or intestinal damage (e.g., during surgery). However, fungal processes may also contribute. In this study, we investigated the translocation process of  using  cell culture models. Translocation occurs as a stepwise process starting with invasion, followed by epithelial damage and loss of epithelial integrity. The ability to secrete candidalysin, a peptide toxin deriving from the hyphal protein Ece1, is key:  hyphae, secreting candidalysin, take advantage of a necrotic weakened  to translocate through the intestinal layer.Copyright © 2018 Allert et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29930978>Human Fetal-Derived Enterospheres Provide Insights on Intestinal Development and a Novel Model to Study Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC).</a></h2><p>Untreated necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) can lead to massive inflammation resulting in intestinal necrosis with a high mortality rate in preterm infants. Limited access to human samples and relevant experimental models have hampered progress in NEC pathogenesis. Earlier evidence has suggested that bacterial colonization of an immature and developing intestine can lead to an abnormally high inflammatory response to bacterial bioproducts. The aim of our study was to use human fetal organoids to gain insights into NEC pathogenesis.RNA sequencing analysis was performed to compare patterns of gene expression in human fetal-derived enterospheres (FEnS) and adult-derived enterospheres (AEnS). Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using computational techniques for dimensional reduction, clustering, and gene set enrichment. Unsupervised cluster analysis, Gene Ontology, and gene pathway analysis were used to predict differences between gene expression of samples. Cell monolayers derived from FEnS and AEnS were evaluated for  function and responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide and commensal bacteria.Based on gene expression patterns, FEnS clustered according to their developmental age in  distinct groups: early and late FEnS, with the latter more closely resembling AEnS. Genes involved in maturation,  barrier function, and innate immunity were responsible for these differences. FEnS-derived monolayers exposed to either lipopolysaccharide or commensal  showed that late FEnS activated gene expression of key inflammatory cytokines, whereas early FEnS monolayers did not, owing to decreased expression of nuclear factor-κB-associated machinery.Our results provide insights into processes underlying human intestinal development and support the use of FEnS as a relevant human preclinical model for NEC.

Ruminants are considered to be less susceptible to the adverse health effects of mycotoxins, mainly because the ruminal microflora degrades certain mycotoxins. Yet, impairment of the ruminal degradation capacity or high ruminal stability of toxins can entail that the intestinal  is exposed to significant mycotoxin amounts. The aims of our study were to assess i) the mycotoxin occurrence in maize silage and ii) the cytotoxicity of relevant mycotoxins on bovine intestinal cells. In total, 158 maize silage samples were collected from European dairy cattle farms. LC-MS/MS-based analysis of 61 mycotoxins revealed the presence of emerging mycotoxins (e.g. emodin, culmorin, enniatin B1, enniatin B, and beauvericin) in more than 70% of samples. Among the regulated mycotoxins, deoxynivalenol and zearalenone were most frequently detected (67.7%). Overall, 87% of maize silages contained more than five mycotoxins. Using an in vitro model with calf small intestinal epithelial cells B, the cytotoxicity of deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, fumonisin B1 and enniatin B was evaluated (0-200 µM). Absolute IC50 values varied in dependence of employed assay and were 1.-3.6 µM, 0.8-1.0 µM, 8.6-18.3 µM, and 4.0-6.7 µM for deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, fumonisin B1, and enniatin B, respectively.

A central determinant of absorption and distribution of flavonoids in the human body is the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2, expressed in   and other barrier tissues. While flavonoids were previously identified as substrates and/or inhibitors of this protein, precise enzyme kinetic calculations of affinity and activity parameters are rare due to the lack of suitable experimental models. We present a novel method that allows the direct measurement of kinetic constants for ABCG2-mediated cellular efflux of natural flavonoids thanks to the application of fluorogenic -aminoethyl diphenylborinate, which reacts with intracellular flavonoids forming a fluorescent, nonmembrane-permeable conjugate, thus making it possible to measure the intracellular substrate concentration throughout the experiment. Our studies were performed in Madin-Darby canine kidney II-derived cell lines expressing human ABCG2 and involve substrate efflux from whole, unmodified cells, precluding the need for plasma membrane vesicle preparation. We present methods for calculation of enzyme kinetic constants by measuring substrate concentration at efflux-influx equilibrium or during efflux from preloaded cells, and we obtained   values of 137 M for quercetin, 36 M for kaempferol, and 348 M for luteolin. Our method also allows direct verification of the transport inhibition mechanism and potentially the structure-activity relationship in substrates. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The study presents the first direct calculation of kinetic constants for enzyme-mediated active transport of natural flavonoids in a whole-cell assay, using a fluorogenic compound to measure intracellular substrate concentrations at specific time points. It has implications for nutriceutical use of polyphenols, mechanisms of food-drug interactions, and studies on absorption/distribution-determining membrane transporters, allowing a quantitative approach to pharmacokinetics of flavonoid transport across barrier tissues.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29778504>Solitary chemosensory cells are a primary epithelial source of IL-25 in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.</a></h2><p>IL-25 can function as an early signal for the respiratory type  response characteristic of allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). In the mouse , tuft cells are the epithelial source of IL-25.

Mucus was collected during acute inflammatory exacerbations from patients with CRSwNP or chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps and IL-25 levels determined by using ELISA. Lastly, sinonasal epithelial cultures derived from polyp and turbinate tissue were stimulated with IL-13 and analyzed for SCC proliferation and IL-25 production.This study demonstrates that a discrete cell type, likely an SCC, characterized by expression of the taste-associated G protein gustducin and the intestinal tuft cell marker doublecortin-like kinase 1, is the predominant source of IL-25 in the human upper airway. Additionally, we show that patients with CRSwNP have increased numbers of SCCs in nasal polyp tissue and that in vitro IL-13 exposure both increased proliferation and induced apical secretion of IL-25 into the mucosal layer.Inflammatory sinus polyps but not adjacent turbinate tissue show expansion of the SCC population, which is the source of epithelial IL-25.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699302>Revisiting an old antibiotic: bacitracin neutralizes binary bacterial toxins and protects cells from intoxication.</a></h2><p>The antibiotic bacitracin (Bac) inhibits cell wall synthesis of gram-positive bacteria.

Realistic in vitro  models require a variety of precise environmental cues, such as chemical and gas gradients, in combination with substrates like mucus that support the growth of microbial communities. This technical brief describes a microfluidic architecture capable of developing a physiologically relevant oxygen gradient that emulates the oxygen profile proximal to the epithelial inner lining of the human colon. The device generates stable and repeatable defined oxygen gradients from 0% to 4 % partial pressure O over a length scale of hundreds of microns, and was applied to study the effects of oxygenation on the structure of native mucus that lines the colon wall. Using simulation as a design tool for hybrid gas-liquid microfluidic devices enables on-chip creation of defined, physiologically oxygen gradients. These microfluidic architectures have powerful potential applications for  physiology, including providing optimal oxygenation conditions for the culture of mammalian epithelial cells in the  lining, as well as creating a realistic mimic of the oxygen gradient found in the intestinal lumen for complex microbiome cultures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529486>A mathematical model to investigate the key drivers of the biogeography of the colon microbiota.</a></h2><p>The  microbiota, mainly located in the colon, is engaged in a complex dialogue with the large intestinal  through which important regulatory processes for the health and well-being of the host take place.

Among the ecological drivers of the microbiota, the spatial structure of the colon is of special interest: spatio-temporal mechanisms can lead to the constitution of spatial interactions among the bacterial populations and of environmental niches that impact the overall colonization of the colon. In the present study, we introduce a mathematical model of the colon microbiota in its fluid environment, based on the explicit coupling of a population dynamics model of microbial populations involved in fibre degradation with a fluid dynamics model of the luminal content. This modeling framework is used to study the main drivers of the spatial structure of the microbiota, specially focusing on the dietary fibre inflow, the epithelial motility, the microbial active swimming and viscosity gradients in the digestive track. We found 1) that the viscosity gradients allow the creation of favorable niches in the vicinity of the mucus layer; ) that very low microbial active swimming in the radial direction is enough to promote bacterial growth, which sheds a new light on microbial motility in the colon and 3) that dietary fibres are the main driver of the spatial structure of the microbiota in the distal bowel whereas epithelial motility is preponderant for the colonization of the proximal colon; in the transverse colon, fibre levels and chemotaxis have the strongest impact on the distribution of the microbial communities.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Defective communication between these compartments at this barrier surface underlies susceptibility to infections and chronic inflammation. Environmental factors play a significant, but mechanistically poorly understood, role in intestinal homeostasis. We found that regeneration of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) upon injury through infection or chemical insults was profoundly influenced by the environmental sensor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). IEC-specific deletion of Ahr resulted in failure to control C. rodentium infection due to unrestricted intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation and impaired differentiation, culminating in malignant transformation. AHR activation by dietary ligands restored barrier homeostasis, protected the stem cell niche, and prevented tumorigenesis via transcriptional regulation of of Rnf43 and Znrf3, E3 ubiquitin ligases that inhibit Wnt-β-catenin signaling and restrict ISC proliferation. Thus, activation of the AHR pathway in IECs guards the stem cell niche to maintain intestinal barrier integrity.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Our previous study has shown that diphenyldihaloketone drugs 4-[3,5-bis[(-chlorophenyl)methylene]-4-oxo-1-piperidinyl]-4-oxo--butenoic acid (CLEFMA) and 3,5-bis[(-fluorophenyl)methylene]-4-piperidinone (EF24) restore  barrier dysfunction and reduce systemic inflammatory response in hemorrhagic shock. We investigated the effect of hemorrhagic shock on proteasome activity of intestinal  and how CLEFMA and EF24 treatments modulate proteasome function in hemorrhagic shock. CLEFMA or EF24 (0.4 mg/kg) were given 1 h after withdrawing 50% of blood from Sprague-Dawley rats; no other resuscitation was provided. After another 5 h of compensation, small  was collected to process tissue for proteasome activity, immunoblotting, and mRNA levels of genes responsible for unfolded-protein response (XBP1, ATF4, glucose-regulated protein of 78/95 kDa, and growth arrest and DNA damage inducible genes 153/34), polyubiquitin B and C, and immunoproteasome subunits β type-8 and -10 and proteasome activator subunit 1. We found that hemorrhagic shock induced proteasome activity in  tissue and reduced the amounts of ubiquitinated proteins displayed on antiubiquitin immunoblots. However, simultaneous induction of unfolded-protein response or immunoproteasome genes was not observed. CLEFMA and EF24 treatments abolished the hemorrhagic shock-induced increase in proteasome activity. Further investigations revealed that the induction of proteasome in hemorrhagic shock is associated with disassembly of 26S proteasome; CLEFMA and EF24 prevented this disassembly. Consistent with these data, CLEFMA and EF24 reduced hemorrhagic shock-induced degradation of 20S substrate ornithine decarboxylase in  tissue. These results suggest that activated proteasome plays an important role in ischemic  pathophysiology, and it can be a druggable target in shock-induced  dysfunction. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Ischemic injury to the  is a trigger for the systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ failure in trauma and hemorrhagic shock.

The pathogen has a battery of virulence factors which it uses to colonise and persist within the host. The host microbiota may play a role in resistance to, and may also be indirectly responsible from some of the consequences of, Salmonella infection. To investigate this, we used 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing to determine the changes in the  microbiota of pigs in response to infection by Salmonella Typhimurium at three locations: ileum mucosa, ileum content and faeces. Early infection ( days post-infection) impacted on the microbiome diversity at the mucosa, reflected in a decrease in representatives of the generally regarded as desirable genera (i.e., Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus). Severe damage in the  of the ileum mucosa correlated with an increase in synergistic (with respect to Salmonella infection; Akkermansia) or opportunistically pathogenic bacteria (Citrobacter) and a depletion in anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium spp., Ruminococcus, or Dialliser). Predictive functional analysis, together with metabolomic analysis revealed changes in glucose and lipid metabolism in infected pigs. The observed changes in commensal healthy microbiota, including the growth of synergistic or potentially pathogenic bacteria and depletion of beneficial or competing bacteria, could contribute to the pathogen's ability to colonize the  successfully. The findings from this study could be used to form the basis for further research aimed at creating intervention strategies to mitigate the effects of Salmonella infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31044013>Quantification of serine protease HtrA molecules secreted by the foodborne pathogen .</a></h2><p> is a major food-borne pathogen and a worldwide health threat. Utilizing different virulence factors,  invades the host's intestinal epithelial cell layer. One important factor in this process is the serine protease HtrA, which is secreted into the extracellular space, and helps the bacteria to transmigrate across the   by cleaving various cell-cell adhesion proteins. The aim of the present study is to quantify the amount of HtrA molecules secreted per bacterial cell in liquid culture and during infection.HtrA protein purification and quantitative Western blotting were used to determine the number of HtrA molecules secreted by two  model strains, 11168 and 81-176, in liquid culture during an 8-h time course. On average, the two strains yielded similar HtrA secretion rates, with strain 11168 secreting 4314 ± 949 molecules and 81-176 secreting 5483 ± 1246 per bacterium after  h. After 8 h, both strains showed a decrease in the average amount of HtrA secreted per bacterial cell over time. Secretion of HtrA by strain 11168 reduced to about 1772 ± 520 molecules and only 2151 ± 562 HtrA molecules were secreted by strain 81-176 at this time point. During infection of  epithelial cells, the secretion of HtrA is slightly higher with a similar secretion pattern over time compared to culturing in vitro.We determined the number of HtrA molecules secreted by single  cells over time. The results suggest that HtrA secretion is regulated in a time-dependent fashion, leading to increasing accumulative HtrA concentrations in the extracellular medium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30480819>Redefining the signaling pathways from pluripotency to pancreas development: In vitro β-cell differentiation.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic β-cells are destroyed by the immune system, in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and are impaired by glucose insensitivity in type  diabetes (T2D). Islet-cells transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach based on in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to insulin-producing cells (IPCs). According to evolutionary stages in β-cell development, there are several distinct checkpoints; each one has a unique characteristic, including definitive endoderm (DE), primitive  (PG), posterior foregut (PF), pancreatic  (PE), endocrine precursor (EP), and immature β-cells up to functional β-cells. A better understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRN) and associated transcription factors in each specific developmental stage, guarantees the achievement of the next successful checkpoints and ensures an efficient β-cell differentiation procedure. The new findings in signaling pathways, related to the development of the pancreas are discussed here, including Wnt, Activin/Nodal, FGF, BMP, retinoic acid (RA), sonic hedgehog (Shh), Notch, and downstream regulators, required for β-cell commitment. We also summarized different approaches in the IPCs protocol to conceptually define a standardized system, leading to the creation of a reproducible method for β-cell differentiation. To normalize blood glucose level in diabetic mice, the replacement therapy in the early differentiation stage, such as EP stages was associated with better outcome when compared with the fully differentiated β-cells' graft.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30013538> Attenuates -Induced Stress of Epithelial Cells by Modulating Tight-Junction Genes and Cytokine Responses.</a></h2><p> Salmonellosis is a prevalent food-borne illness that causes diarrhea in over 130 million humans yearly and can lead to death. There is an urgent need to find alternatives to antibiotics as many salmonellae are now multidrug resistant. As such, specific beneficial bacteria and dietary fibers can be an alternative as they may prevent  Typhimurium (STM) infection and spreading by strengthening intestinal barrier function.  We tested whether immune active long-chain inulin-type fructans and/or  W37,  W63, and  W56 can strengthen barrier integrity of intestinal Caco- cells in the presence and absence of a STM. Effects of the ingredients on intestinal barrier function were first evaluated by quantifying trans-epithelial electric resistance (TEER) and regulation of gene expression by microarray. Only  had effects on TEER and modulated a group of 26 genes related to tight-junctions. Inulin-type fructans,  W63 and  W56 regulated other genes, unrelated to tight-junctions.  also had unique effects on a group of six genes regulating epithelial phenotype toward follicle-associated .  W37 was therefore selected for a challenge with STM and prevented STM-induced barrier disruption and decreased secretion of IL-8.  W37 increases TEER and can protect against STM induced disruption of  epithelial cells integrity . Our results suggest that selection of specific bacterial strains for enforcing barrier function may be a promising strategy to reduce or prevent STM infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030221>Feeding of deoxynivalenol increases the intestinal paracellular permeability of broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>In recent years, the deleterious effects attributed to mycotoxins, in particular on the intestine, faced increased attention and it was shown that deoxynivalenol (DON) causes adverse effects on  health. In this context, it has been repeatedly reported that DON can alter the intestinal morphology, disrupt the intestinal barrier and reduce nutrient absorption. The underlying mechanism of a compromised intestinal barrier caused by DON in chickens has yet to be illustrated. Although, DON is rapidly absorbed from the upper parts of the small intestine, the effects on the large intestine cannot be excluded. Additionally, a damaging effect of DON on the   might decrease the resistance of the  against infectious agents. Consequently, the objectives of the present studies were: (1) to investigate the impact of DON on the epithelial paracellular permeability by demonstrating the mucosal to serosal flux of C-mannitol in the small and large intestine applying Ussing chambers and () to delineate the effects of DON on the colonization and translocation of Escherichia coli. Both parameters are well suited as potential indicators for  barrier failure. For this, a total of 75 one-day-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were housed in floor pens on wood shavings with feed and water provided ad libitum. Birds were randomly allocated to three different groups (n = 25 with 5 replicates/group) and were fed for 5 weeks with either contaminated diets (5 or 10 mg DON/kg feed) or basal diets (control). Body weight (BW) and BW gain of birds in the group fed with 10 mg/kg DON were significantly lower than in group with 5 mg/kg DON and the control group. Moreover, the mannitol flux in jejunum and cecum was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in DON-fed groups compared to control birds. Consistent with this, DON enhanced the translocation of E. coli with a higher number of bacteria encountered in the spleen and liver. Altogether, the actual results verified that DON can alter the intestinal paracellular permeability in broiler chickens and facilitates the translocation of enteric microorganisms such as E. coli to extra-intestinal organs. Considering that moderate levels of DON are present in feed, the consumption of DON-contaminated feed can induce an intestinal breakdown with negative consequences on broiler health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862756>A More Robust  Microbiota in Calorie-Restricted Mice Is Associated with Attenuated Intestinal Injury Caused by the Chemotherapy Drug Cyclophosphamide.</a></h2><p>Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is widely used in cancer chemotherapy, but it often induces mucositis, in which the disruption of the  microbiota might play a pivotal role. Whether the manipulation of the  microbiota can be used as a strategy to improve CTX-induced mucositis remains to be studied. Here we observed the effects of a 4-week calorie restriction (CR) on CTX-induced mucositis. Compared with -fed mice, CR mice showed significantly less mucositis in response to CTX, including lower intestinal permeability, less bacterial translocation, higher number of epithelial stem cells, and less  damage. CTX induced significant shifts of the  microbiota of the  microbiota in -fed control mice. In contrast, CR mice showed no significant change in their  microbiota in responding to CTX treatment. CR significantly enriched the  microbiota in  and  which are known to mitigate inflammation and improve  barrier function. These findings suggest that CR remodeled  microbiota is more robust and may contribute to attenuate the side effects of cyclophosphamide, which supports the concept that cancer chemotherapy would benefit from strategies targeting the  microbiota. Improving the  microbiota via calorie restriction is beneficial for human health. Our findings showed differential responses between calorie-restricted mice and -fed mice. Compared with the -fed mice, the calorie-restricted mice were less susceptible to cyclophosphamide side effects otherwise observed on the  integrity and its microbiota. These results show the potential benefits of manipulating the  microbiota with CR prior to cancer chemotherapy.Copyright © 2019 Liu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517482>16α-Hydroxytrametenolic Acid from  Improves Intestinal Barrier Function Through the Glucocorticoid Receptor-Mediated PI3K/Akt/NF-κB Pathway.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the effect of triterpenoids from edible mushroom  on intestinal  integrity and revealed the transcriptional regulatory pathways that underpin restorative mechanisms in the . Based on computational docking studies, transcriptional activation experiments and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein immunofluorescence localization assays in cultured cells, 16α-hydroxytrametenolic acid (HTA) was discovered as a novel GR agonist in this study. HTA ameliorates TNF-α-induced Caco- monolayer intestinal epithelial barrier damage and suppressed activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt), which attenuated downstream IκB and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) phosphorylation through GR activation. Moreover, HTA prevented NF-κB translocation into the nucleus and binding to its cis-element and suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced downstream NO production and pro-inflammatory cytokines at both protein and mRNA expression levels. In conclusion, HTA from  improves intestinal barrier function through a GR-mediated PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway and may be potentially exploited as a supportive dietary therapeutic strategy for restoring  health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30661054>Genome-wide association analysis of diverticular disease points towards neuromuscular, connective tissue and epithelial pathomechanisms.</a></h2><p>Diverticular disease is a common complex disorder characterised by mucosal outpouchings of the colonic wall that manifests through complications such as diverticulitis, perforation and bleeding. We report the to date largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic risk factors for diverticular disease.Discovery GWAS analysis was performed on UK Biobank imputed genotypes using 31 964 cases and 419 135 controls of European descent. Associations were replicated in a European sample of 3893 cases and 2829 diverticula-free controls and evaluated for risk contribution to diverticulitis and uncomplicated diverticulosis. Transcripts at top 20 replicating loci were analysed by real-time quatitative PCR in preparations of the mucosal, submucosal and muscular layer of colon. The localisation of expressed protein at selected loci was investigated by immunohistochemistry.We discovered 48 risk loci, of which 12 are novel, with genome-wide significance and consistent OR in the replication sample. Nominal replication (p<0.05) was observed for 27 loci, and additional 8 in meta-analysis with a population-based cohort. The most significant novel risk variant rs9960286 is located near  with a p value of .3×10 and 0.002 (OR=1.14 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.24)) in the replication analysis. Four loci showed stronger effects for diverticulitis,  (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.56),  (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.42),  (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.33) and  (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.33).In silico analyses point to diverticulosis primarily as a disorder of intestinal neuromuscular function and of impaired connective fibre support, while an additional diverticulitis risk might be conferred by epithelial dysfunction.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Nlrp6 modulates the   interaction with the microbiota. However, the expression and function of Nlrp6 in the kidney, a sterile environment, have not been characterized. We explored the role of Nlrp6 in acute kidney injury (AKI).In a transcriptomics array of murine nephrotoxic AKI, Nlrp6 and Naip3 were the only significantly downregulated NLR genes. The functional implications of Nlrp6 downregulation were explored in mice and in cultured murine tubular cells.Nlrp6 was expressed by healthy murine and human kidney tubular , and expression was reduced during human kidney injury or murine nephrotoxic AKI induced by cisplatin or a folic acid overdose. Genetic Nlrp6 deficiency resulted in upregulation of kidney extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/ (ERK1/) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and more severe AKI and kidney inflammation. In cultured tubular cells, Nlrp6 downregulation induced by specific small interfering RNA resulted in upregulation of ERK1/ and p38 phosphorylation and chemokine messenger RNA expression and downregulation of the nephroprotective gene Klotho. MAPK inhibition prevented the inflammatory response in Nlrp6-deficient cells.Nlrp6 dampens sterile inflammation and has a nephroprotective role during nephrotoxic kidney injury through suppression of MAP kinase activation.© The Author(s) 2019.

In this study, we explored the effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on IMB function and  microbiota in mice. BDNF gene knock-out mice (the BDNF group) and wild-type mice (the BDNF group) were selected. The  microbiota of these mice was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) assay. The ultrastructure of the ileum and the colonic  obtained from decapitated mice were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The protein expression of epithelial tight junction proteins, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin was detected by immunohistochemistry staining. The protein expression of claudin-1 and claudin- was determined by Western blotting. The DGGE band patterns of  microbiota in the BDNF group were significantly different from that in the BDNF group, which indicated that the BDNF expression alters the  microbiota in mice. Compared with the BDNF group, the BDNF group presented no significant difference in the ultrastructure of ileal ; however, a significant difference was observed in the colonic epithelial barrier, manifested by decreased microvilli, widening intercellular space and bacterial invasion. Compared with the BDNF group, the expression of ZO-1 and occludin in the BDNF group was significantly decreased. The expression of claudin-1 in the BDNF group was significantly reduced, while the expression of claudin- was elevated.

Purification technologies are often too expensive or not practically applicable for large-scale implementation, especially in impoverished nations where heavy metal contamination is widespread.  GR-1 (LGR-1) was shown in previous work to reduce heavy metal bioaccumulation in a Tanzanian cohort of women and children through indeterminant mechanisms. Here, it was hypothesized that LGR-1 could sequester the heavy metals lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd), thereby reducing their absorption across intestinal . LGR-1 and other lactobacilli significantly reduced the amount of Pb and Cd in solution at all concentrations tested (0.5 mg/L - 50 mg/L) and exhibited sustained binding profiles over a 48-hour period. Relative binding efficiency of LGR-1 decreased as Pb concentration increased, with an absolute minimum binding threshold apparent at concentrations of  mg/L and above. Electron microscopy revealed that Pb formed irregular cell-surface clusters on LGR-1, while Cd appeared to form intracellular polymeric clusters. Additionally, LGR-1 was able to significantly reduce apical-to-basolateral translocation of Pb and Cd in a Caco- model of the intestinal . These findings demonstrate the absorbent properties of LGR-1 can immobilize Pb and Cd, effectively reducing their translocation across the intestinal  .

Interleukin-22 binding protein (IL-22BP), provided by dendritic cells at the sub-epithelial dome region, inhibits the IL-22-mediated secretion of antimicrobial peptides by the FAE. The Notch signal from stromal cells underneath the FAE diminishes goblet cell differentiation. These events dampen the mucosal barrier functions to allow luminal microorganisms to readily gain access to the luminal surface of the FAE. Furthermore, receptor activator of nucleic factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) from a certain stromal cell type induces differentiation into microfold (M) cells that specialize in antigen uptake in the mucosa. Microfold (M) cells play a key role in mucosal immune surveillance by actively transporting external antigens from the  lumen to the lymphoid follicle. The molecular basis of antigen uptake by M cells has been gradually identified in the last decade. For example, GPI-anchored molecules (e.g., glycoprotein  (GP2) and cellular prion protein (PrP)) and β1-integrin facilitate the transport of specific types of xenobiotics. The antigen transport by M cells initiates antigen-specific mucosal immune responses represented by the induction of secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA).

This study aimed to examine the use of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) in mitigating damages caused by UC on the colon . Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC mice were treated with vehicle control, TRF, alpha-tocopherol (αTP) and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Observable clinical signs, quality of stool, histopathological scoring, inflammatory and oxidative markers were assessed. Vitamin E levels of colons and plasma were quantified. Oral supplementation of TRF significantly reduced the severity of DSS-induced UC by lowering the disease activity index (DAI) and histopathological inflammatory scoring. TRF also attenuated the DSS-induced enlargement of spleen and shortening of the colon. TRF has demonstrated marked anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties indicated by the attenuation of DSS-induced upregulation of inflammation and oxidative stress markers including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, myeloperoxidase (MPO), cyclooxygenase- (COX-), nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and pNF-κB. These improvements were similar to that of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) treatment. In contrast, αTP did not demonstrate evident clinical and histopathological improvements. The superior protective effect of TRF may be ascribed to the preferential absorption of TRF by the  mucosa. TRF alleviated the signs and symptoms of acute UC in murine model via the reduction of local inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress. These effects suggested that TRF could serve as a  health supplement for preventive measures for UC condition in patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30094867>The  microbiome and aquatic toxicology: An emerging concept for environmental health.</a></h2><p>The microbiome plays an essential role in the health and onset of diseases in all animals, including humans.

The duration of diarrheal symptom may be shortened by antibiotic treatment, but ETEC is relative refractory to common antibiotics. Burgeoning evidence suggests bioactive components that naturally occur in human milk (e.g., lysozyme and oligosaccharides) and plants (e.g., nondigestible carbohydrates and phytochemicals) contain antimicrobial functions are promising preventive measures to control ETEC infection. Although the exact protective mechanisms may vary for each compound and are still not completely understood, they generally act to (1) competitively inhibit the binding of pathogenic bacteria and toxins to  ; () directly kill pathogens; and (3) stimulate and/or enhance host mucosal and systemic immune defense against pathogenic microorganisms. An appropriate ETEC-challenge animal model is critical to evaluate the effect and unveil the mechanism of bioactive compounds in prevention of enteric infection. Despite wide application in biomedical research, rodents do not usually manifest typical clinical signs of enteric infections. The remarkable differences in digestive physiology, immune response, and  microbiota between rodents and human beings necessitate the use of alternative animal models. Pigs are closely related to humans in terms of genomes, physiology, anatomy of gastrointestinal tracts, digestive enzymes, components of immune system, and  microbiota. Like human infants and young children, nursing and nursery piglets are more susceptible to ETEC infection and reproduce the clinical signs as observed in humans. Hence, the ETEC-challenge piglet represents a valuable translational model to study pathogenesis and evaluate dietary factors (e.g., milk bioactive compounds, nondigestible carbohydrates, and phytochemicals) as preventive measures for ETEC infection in pediatrics.© The Author(s) 2019.

We hypothesized that Schlafen 12 (SLFN12) regulates enterocyte differentiation.We used laser capture dissection of , qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry to evaluate SLFN12 expression in biopsies of control and fasting human duodenal mucosa, and viral overexpression and siRNA to trace the SLFN12 pathway in human Caco- and HIEC6 intestinal epithelial cells.Fasting human duodenal mucosa expressed less SLFN12 mRNA and protein, accompanied by decreases in enterocytic markers like sucrase-isomaltase. SLFN12 overexpression increased Caco- sucrase-isomaltase promoter activity, mRNA, and protein independently of proliferation, and activated the SLFN12 putative promoter. SLFN12 coprecipitated Serpin B12 (SERPB12). An inactivating SLFN12 point mutation prevented both SERPB12 binding and sucrase-isomaltase induction. SERPB12 overexpression also induced sucrase-isomaltase, while reducing SERPB12 prevented the SLFN12 effect on sucrase-isomaltase. Sucrase-isomaltase induction by both SLFN12 and SERPB12 was attenuated by reducing UCHL5 or USP14, and blocked by reducing both. SERPB12 stimulated USP14 but not UCHL5 activity. SERPB12 coprecipitated USP14 but not UCHL5. Moreover, SLFN12 increased protein levels of the sucrase-isomaltase-promoter-binding transcription factor cdx2 without altering Cdx2 mRNA. This was prevented by reducing UCHL5 and USP14. We further validated this pathway in vitro and in vivo. SLFN12 or SERPB12 overexpression induced sucrase-isomaltase in human non-malignant HIEC-6 enterocytes.SLFN12 regulates human enterocytic differentiation by a pathway involving SERPB12, the deubiquitylases, and Cdx2.

Intestinal epithelial Caco- cells cultured on the extracellular matrix-coated porous membrane in a -on-a-chip undergo three-dimensional villus morphogenesis and physiological cytodifferentiation. The -on-a-chip closely recapitulates biomechanical and functional characteristics under peristalsis-like cyclic movements and trickling flow, which enables to co-culture  microbiome with villus  from days to weeks. Host- microbiome ecosystem emulated in the -on-a-chip allows the pathomimetic modeling of human intestinal diseases such as  inflammation and bacterial overgrowth. Here, we describe a protocol for microfabrication of a -on-a-chip device, reconstitution of intestinal microenvironment, recreation of host- microbiome intercellular interactions, and demonstration of the pathophysiology of representative human intestinal diseases associated with the  microbiome. The modeling of intestinal disease pathophysiology on-chip can potentiate the development of patient-specific disease models that can validate the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic interventions.© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a master regulator of energy metabolism plays a critical role in epithelial barrier function. AMPK activation promotes epithelial differentiation and facilitates cell polarity establishment, both of which strengthen epithelial barrier. In addition, AMPK promotes the assembly of tight junctions and adherens junctions by direct phosphorylation of proteins composing apical junctions, junctional anchors, and cytoskeletons. Pharmacological and nutraceutical compounds, as well as physiological states triggering AMPK activation strengthen epithelial barrier function. This review summarized recent progress in delineating the regulatory roles of AMPK in apical junction formation and barrier function of intestinal .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250018> microbiota dysbiosis increases the risk of visceral gout in goslings through translocation of -derived lipopolysaccharide.</a></h2><p>We investigated the -kidney interaction in goslings with gout and tried to decipher the probable mechanisms through which  dysbiosis leads to the progression of renal injury and inflammation. A total of 15 goslings (Anser cygnoides), with typical visceral gout symptoms, were screened and compared with 15 healthy goslings. We determined the signatures of the microbiome in the cecum chyme of goslings in the  groups by 16S sequencing, and analyzed the changes in intestinal permeability, levels of serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the induced inflammatory response of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We found the existence of  dysbiosis in goslings with gout as a result of interactions among the multitude of bacteria present in the , and the proliferation of a specific pathogenic genus, Proteobacteria, played a decisive role in this process. Moreover, the permeability increased not only in the intestinal  but also in the renal endothelium, providing possibilities for -derived LPS to enter the blood circulation and damage the kidneys. The systemic LPS concentration was increased in the gout group and exhibited a positive correlation with the degree of renal injury. In addition, we also found that inflammatory disorders concurrently existed in the  and kidney of goslings with gout, and the LPS/TLR4/MyD88 (Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88) inflammatory signaling was activated. These results indicate that the loss of intestinal barrier as a result of  dysbiosis causes the translocation of -derived LPS, which can play an important role in the development of gout in goslings through interference with kidney functions.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29897487>Dietary Red Raspberry Reduces Colorectal Inflammation and Carcinogenic Risk in Mice with Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colitis.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis causes recurring intestinal mucosal injury and sustained inflammation, increasing the likelihood of colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Dietary red raspberry (RB) is a rich source of phytonutrients known to have anti-inflammatory activity; however, the role of RB on CRC prevention in chronic colitis has not been examined.This study examined the effects of dietary RB supplementation on inflammation,  repair, and oncogenic signaling in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis in mice.Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control or RB (5% of dry feed weight; n = 12/group) diet for 10 wk. Starting from the fourth week, mice were administered  repeated cycles of 1% DSS (7-d DSS treatment plus 14-d recovery) and were monitored daily for disease activity index (DAI) score. Colonic tissues were collected at the end of the study for histochemical, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analysis of inflammation, differentiation and proliferation markers.RB supplementation reduced the DAI score and histologic damage (by 38.9%; P ≤ 0.01), expression of inflammatory mediators (by 20-70%; P ≤ 0.01), infiltration of CD4 T cells (by 50%; P ≤ 0.05), and α4β7 integrin and related adhesion molecules (by 33.3%; P ≤ 0.01). Furthermore, RB supplementation facilitated  repair, as evidenced by enhanced goblet cell density, expression of transcription factors including Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) and Hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes1), terminal differentiation markers, mucin  (Muc2), and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (by 20-200%; P ≤ 0.01). Conversely, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (by 70%; P ≤ 0.01), β-catenin, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling (by 19-33%; P ≤ 0.05) were reduced by RB supplementation. In addition, RB supplementation enhanced p53 stability (by 53%) and reduced oncogenic gene expression (by 50-60%).RB supplementation reduced DAI score and the risk of CRC development during recurring colitis in mice, suggesting that RB is a possible dietary supplement for patients with ulcerative colitis and related  inflammatory diseases.© 2018 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29163218>Exosomes and Metabolic Function in Mice Exposed to Alternating Dark-Light Cycles Mimicking Night Shift Work Schedules.</a></h2><p>Sleep is an important modulator of metabolic function. Disruptions of sleep in circadian rhythm are common in modern societies and are associated with increased risk of developing cardiometabolic disorders. Exosomes are ubiquitous extracellular vesicles that may play a mechanistic role in metabolic derangements. We hypothesized that alternating dark-light cycles mimicking shift work in mice would alter fecal microbiota and colonic  permeability and alter plasma exosome cargo and metabolic function. C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to (i) control day light (CL), or (ii) inverted dark-light every  weeks for 8 weeks (IN). Body weight, fat mass and HOMA-IR were measured, along with Tregs, metabolic, and resident macrophages in visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT). Fecal water samples were incubated with confluent colonic  cell cultures in electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) arrays, and plasma exosomes were added to differentiated adipocytes and insulin-induced pAKT/AKT expression changes were assessed by western blots. Mice exposed to IN showed elevated HOMA-IR, and their fecal samples showed altered microbiota which promote increased permeability of the colonic epithelial cell barrier. Plasma exosomes decreased pAKT/AKT responses to exogenous insulin compared to CL, and altered expression of circadian clock genes. Inflammatory macrophages (Ly-6c) were increased in IN-exposed vWAT, while Tregs were decreased. Thus,  microbiota and the cargo of plasma exosomes are altered by periodic shifts in environmental lighting, and effectively alter metabolic function, possibly via induction of systemic inflammation and altered clock expression in target tissues. Further exploration of exosomal miRNA signatures in shift workers and their putative metabolic organ cell targets appears warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29688587>GALT carcinoma: three case reports with glycoprotein  immunohistochemistry and electron microscopic observations.</a></h2><p>-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) carcinoma is a rare colorectal tumour that arises in the  covering GALT. GALT carcinoma is a differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma with dense lymphoid tissue with a characteristically well-demarcated margin. To date, 26 cases of GALT carcinoma, including the three cases discussed here, have been reported. Most (24 of 26) were discovered at early stages and none of the cases have documented any metastases. This suggests that GALT carcinoma may have a favourable prognosis. It is hypothesised that GALT carcinoma originates from M cells in specialised epithelia covering GALT. However, this hypothesis has yet to be confirmed.In this study, we examined three cases of GALT carcinoma by immunohistochemistry detection of glycoprotein , a specific marker for M cells, and electron microscopy. Our findings showed that the tumour cells of GALT carcinoma in all three cases were negative for M cells. We thus concluded that GALT carcinoma may be a tubular adenocarcinoma arising by chance in the GALT. This unique carcinoma is a diferentiated adenocarcinoma that grows slowly with the development of GALT.We propose that GALT carcinoma should be classified separately because of its histological setting and good prognosis.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29368445>Lactobacillus reuteri strains protect epithelial barrier integrity of IPEC-J2 monolayers from the detrimental effect of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>Lactobacillus reuteri is an inhabitant of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of mammals and birds and several strains of this species are known to be effective probiotics. The mechanisms by which L. reuteri confers its health-promoting effects are far from being fully understood, but protection of the mucosal barrier is thought to be important. Leaky  is a state of abnormal intestinal permeability with implications for the pathophysiology of various gastrointestinal disorders. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) can invade the intestinal mucosa and induce changes in barrier function by producing enterotoxin or by direct invasion of the intestinal . Our hypothesis was that L. reuteri can protect the mucosal barrier, and the goal of the study was to challenge this hypothesis by monitoring the protective effect of L. reuteri strains on epithelial dysfunction caused by ETEC. Using an infection model based on the porcine intestinal cell line IPEC-J2, it was demonstrated that pretreatment of the cells with human-derived L. reuteri strains (ATCC PTA 6475, DSM 17938 and 1563F) and a rat strain (R2LC) reduced the detrimental effect of ETEC in a dose-dependent manner, as monitored by permeability of FITC-dextran and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Moreover, the results revealed that ETEC upregulated proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα and decreased expression of the shorter isoform of ZO-1 (187 kDa) and E-cadherin. In contrast, pretreatment with L. reuteri DSM 17938 and 1563F downregulated expression of IL-6 and TNFα, and led to an increase in production of the longer isoform of ZO-1 (195 kDa) and maintained E-cadherin expression. Interestingly, expression of ZO-1 (187 kDa) was preserved only when the infected cells were pretreated with strain 1563F. These findings demonstrate that L. reuteri strains exert a protective effect against ETEC-induced mucosal integrity disruption.© 2018 The Authors.

One class of such receptor-ligand pairs involves formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) that have been shown to influence inflammatory response and repair. Here we explored the role of murine Fpr2/3, an ortholog of human FPR2/receptor for lipoxin A4 (ALX), in orchestrating intestinal mucosal repair. Compared with wild-type (WT) mice,  mice exhibited delayed recovery from acute experimental colitis and perturbed repair after biopsy-induced colonic mucosal injury. Decreased numbers of infiltrating monocytes were observed in healing wounds from  mice compared with WT animals. Bone marrow transplant experiments revealed that  monocytes showed a competitive disadvantage when infiltrating colonic wounds. Moreover,  monocytes were defective in chemotactic responses to the chemokine CC chemokine ligand (CCL)20, which is up-regulated during early phases of inflammation. Analysis of  monocytes revealed altered expression of the CCL20 receptor CC chemokine receptor (CCR)6, suggesting that Fpr2/3 regulates CCL20-CCR6-mediated monocyte chemotaxis to sites of mucosal injury in the .

Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), normally present in neural tissue, exists in close apposition to the mucosal immune system and intestinal , and a bi-directional communication is known to occur at these interfaces. Somatostatin has been shown to suppress the inflammatory reaction, and has been used in several clinical trials to treat inflammatory disorders, such rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, somatostatin receptor type 2A, that regulates neurotransmission, proliferation, and apoptosis, has been recognized in IBD. Although prominent abnormalities in the morphology of the enteric nervous system have been observed in idiopathic IBD, they are more marked in Crohn disease.A 55-year-old woman with recurrent Crohn disease, just surgically treated for ileal resection, have a stenotic complication.At surgery 5 cm of preterminal ileum with stenosis and anastomotic ileocolic block was removed.The histopathology showed a recurrent Crohn in fistulo-stenotic phase; the stenosis was mainly sustained by mass-forming, ganglioneuromatous hyperplasia. Normally very rare, fine nerve twigs extend up into mucosa but we found a new-formed fibrillary network, extending into the inflammation area at the subepithelial luminal site of the mucosa, that was positive to PD-L1 and somatostatin receptor type 2A (SSTR2A) immunostaining but not visualized in routinary stained slides.After surgery the patient was semestrally followed with clinical endoscopic evaluation that results uneventfully.Our case shows that before surgery neuromatous abnormalities can be predicted by immunostained new-formed twigs in the mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29875401>Supplementation of p40, a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG-derived protein, in early life promotes epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent intestinal development and long-term health outcomes.</a></h2><p>The beneficial effects of the  microbiota on growth in early life are well known. However, knowledge about the mechanisms underlying regulating intestinal development by the microbiota is limited. p40, a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG-derived protein, transactivates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in intestinal epithelial cells for protecting the intestinal  against injury and inflammation. Here, we developed p40-containing pectin/zein hydrogels for targeted delivery of p40 to the small intestine and the colon. Treatment with p40-containing hydrogels from postnatal day  to 21 significantly enhanced bodyweight gain prior to weaning and functional maturation of the intestine, including intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and tight junction formation, and IgA production in early life in wild-type mice. These p40-induced effects were abolished in mice with specific deletion of EGFR in intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting that transactivation of EGFR in intestinal epithelial cells may mediate p40-regulated intestinal development. Furthermore, neonatal p40 treatment reduced the susceptibility to intestinal injury and colitis and promoted protective immune responses, including IgA production and differentiation of regulatory T cells, in adult mice. These findings reveal novel roles of neonatal supplementation of probiotic-derived factors in promoting EGFR-mediated maturation of intestinal functions and innate immunity, which likely promote long-term beneficial outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29533744>Shiga toxin  translocation across intestinal  is linked to virulence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in humans.</a></h2><p>Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are characterized by the release of potent Shiga toxins (Stx), which are associated with severe intestinal and renal disease. Although all STEC strains produce Stx, only a few serotypes cause infection in humans. To determine which virulence traits in vitro are linked to human disease in vivo, 13 Stx2a-producing STEC strains of seropathotype (SPT) A or B (associated with severe human intestinal disease and outbreaks) and 6 strains of SPT D or E (rarely or not linked to human disease) were evaluated in a microaerobic human colonic epithelial infection model. All SPT strains demonstrated similar growth, colonization of polarized T84 colon carcinoma cells and Stx release into the medium. In contrast, Stx translocation across the T84 cell monolayer was significantly lower in SPT group DE compared to SPT group AB strains. Further experiments showed that Stx penetration occurred via a transcellular pathway and was independent of bacterial type III secretion and attaching and effacing lesion formation. These results suggest that the extent of Stx transcytosis across the   may represent an important indicator of STEC pathogenicity for humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30521380>Development of a host-microbiome model of the small intestine.</a></h2><p>The intestinal  plays an essential role in the balance between tolerant and protective immune responses to infectious agents. In vitro models do not typically consider the innate immune response and  microbiome in detail, so these models do not fully mimic the physiologic aspects of the small intestine. We developed and characterized a long-term in vitro model containing enterocyte, goblet, and immune-like cells exposed to a synthetic microbial community representative of commensal inhabitants of the small intestine. This model showed differential responses toward a synthetic microbial community of commensal bacterial inhabitants of the small intestine in the absence or presence of LPS from Escherichia coli O111:B4. Simultaneous exposure to LPS and microbiota induced impaired epithelial barrier function; increased production of IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 16; and augmented differentiation and adhesion of macrophage-like cells and the overexpression of dual oxidase  and TLR- and -4 mRNA.

Here, the molecular mechanisms were analyzed associated with starch-triggered maturation and transport of SI. Biosynthetic pulse-chase in Caco- cells revealed that the high MW SI species (265 kDa) induced by maltose (an α-amylase starch digestion product) had a higher rate of early trafficking and maturation compared with a glucose-induced SI (245 kDa). The maltose-induced SI was found to have higher affinity to lipid rafts, which are associated with enhanced targeting to the apical membrane and higher activity. Accordingly, in situ maltose-hydrolyzing action was enhanced in the maltose-treated cells. Thus, starch digestion products at the luminal surface of small intestinal enterocytes are sensed and accelerate the intracellular processing of SI to enhance starch digestion capacity in the intestinal lumen.-Chegeni, M., Amiri, M., Nichols, B.

Mucus mainly consists of heavily glycosylated proteins called mucins, which are secreted by goblet cells. The  mucus layer is a pivotal part of the intestinal protection and colonized by commensal microbes, essential for the development and health of the host. There is a symbiotic interaction between intestinal microbiota and the host cells. On the one hand, mucus provides nutrients for the growth and adhesion of microbes; on the other hand, mucin-degrading bacteria generate energy sources for the host . However, the mucusmicrobial interaction has rarely been considered in the context of stress exposure.

Causes of epidermal barrier breakdown are complex and driven by a combination of structural, genetic, environmental and immunological factors. In addition, alteration in microflora diversity can influence disease severity, duration, and response to treatment. Clinically, atopic dermatitis can progress from skin disease to food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and later asthma, a phenomenon commonly known as the atopic march. The mechanism by which atopic dermatitis progresses towards gastrointestinal or airway disease remains to be elucidated.This review addresses how epithelial dysfunction linking microbiome alteration and immune dysregulation can predispose to the development of the atopic march.A literature search was conducted using the PubMed database for relevant articles with the keywords 'atopic dermatitis', 'epithelial barrier', 'skin', '', 'lung', 'microbiome' and 'immune dysregulation'.Initial disruption in the skin epidermal barrier permits allergen sensitization and colonization by pathogens. This induces a T helper  inflammatory response and a thymic stromal lymphopoietin-mediated pathway that further promotes barrier breakdown at distant sites, including the intestinal and respiratory tract.As there are no immediate cures for food allergy or asthma, early intervention aimed at protecting the skin barrier and effective control of local and systemic inflammation may improve long-term outcomes and reduce allergen sensitization in the airway and .© 2018 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513797>Suppressive and  Reparative Functions of Human Type 1 T Regulatory Cells.</a></h2><p>T-regulatory (Treg) cells suppress the immune response to maintain homeostasis.

IL10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, so Tr1 cells might be used the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. We aimed to develop methods to isolate and expand human Tr1 cells and define their functions.We obtained blood samples and colon biopsy samples from patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or healthy individuals (controls). CD4 T cells were isolated from blood samples and stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 beads, and Tr1 cells were purified by using an IL10 cytokine-capture assay and cell sorting. FOXP3-positive Treg cells were sorted as CD4CD25CD127 cells from unstimulated cells. Tr1 and FOXP3-positive Treg cells were expanded, and phenotypes and gene expression profiles were compared. T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 beads, and the suppressive abilities of Tr1 and FOXP3-positive Treg cells were measured. Human colon organoid cultures were established, cultured with supernatants from Tr1 or FOXP3-positive cells, and analyzed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. T84 cells (human colon adenocarcinoma epithelial cells) were incubated with supernatants from Tr1 or FOXP3-positive cells, and transepithelial electrical resistance was measured to determine epithelial cell barrier function.Phenotypes of Tr1 cells isolated from control individuals vs patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis did not differ significantly after expansion. Tr1 cells and FOXP3-positive Treg cells suppressed proliferation of effector T cells, but only Tr1 cells suppressed secretion of IL1B and tumor necrosis factor from myeloid cells. Tr1 cells, but not FOXP3-positive Treg cells, isolated from healthy individuals and patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis secreted IL22, which regulated repair of the  and promoted barrier function of human intestinal epithelial cells. Tr1 cell culture supernatants promoted differentiation of mucin-producing goblet cells in intestinal organoid cultures.Human Tr1 cells suppress proliferation of effector T cells (adaptive immune response) and production of IL1B and TNF by myeloid cells (inmate immune response). They also secrete IL22 to regulate repair of the  and promote barrier function. They might be developed as a cell-based therapy for intestinal inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

However, the exact biological effects of these nanoparticles have not been studied in detail, particularly in the . In the present study we observed that colloidal Pt was not cytotoxic towards three different epithelial colon cancer cell lines. Co-treatment of the colon cancer cell line Caco- with the oxidative stress inducing agent hydrogen peroxide (HO) and colloidal Pt resulted in a significant decrease in HO induced oxidative stress. Colloidal Pt by itself did not induce any oxidative stress. Additionally, both overnight pretreatment of Caco- cells with colloidal Pt followed by 1 h treatment with HO, or co-treatment of cells for 1 h with colloidal Pt and HO resulted in a significant recovery of cell death. Of note, the same protective effects of colloidal Pt were not observed when the oxidative stress was induced in the presence of , -azobis (-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, indicating that the source of free radicals may define the outcome of anti-oxidant activity of colloidal Pt. Colloidal Pt was also able to cross a model intestinal barrier formed  with differentiated Caco- cells easily.

To explore the impact of these cells on intestinal microbial communities, we assessed the composition of the microbiota in pTreg cell-deficient and -sufficient mice. pTreg cell deficiency led to heightened type  immune responses triggered by microbial exposure, which disrupted the niche of border-dwelling bacteria early during colonization. Moreover, impaired pTreg cell generation led to pervasive changes in metabolite profiles, altered features of the intestinal , and reduced body weight in the presence of commensal microbes. Absence of a single species of bacteria depleted in pTreg cell-deficient animals, Mucispirillum schaedleri, partially accounted for the sequelae of pTreg cell deficiency. These observations suggest that pTreg cells modulate the metabolic function of the intestinal microbiota by restraining immune defense mechanisms that may disrupt a particular bacterial niche.Copyright © 2018.

Current in vitro  models fail in reproducing the complex intestinal extracellular matrix (ECM) network of the lamina propria and the peculiar architecture of the crypt-villus axis. Here we proposed a novel in vitro human intestine model that mimics the intestinal stromal topography and composition and strictly reproduces the tissue polarity with the crypt-villus architecture. First we developed a 3D human intestinal stromal equivalent (3D-ISE) composed of human intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) embedded in their own extracellular matrix. Then, we seeded human colon carcinoma-derived cells (Caco-) onto flat or patterned cell-synthetized stromal equivalent structure and cultured them until the formation of a well-oriented . We demonstrated that the patterned stroma increases the absorbing surface area, the epithelial proliferation rate, and the density of microvilli. In addition it induces changes in the biological functions of the epithelial cells such as enzymes and mucus production, polarization and tightness showing a physiological cell-lineage compartmentalization along the crypt/villi axes with the undifferentiated phenotypes at the base. At last, we reproduced an inflamed intestinal tissue model in which we identified the contribution of the stromal microenvironment by molecular (cytokines release and MMPs production) and immunofluorescence analyses and the effects of the epithelial-stromal cross-talk in the intestinal innate immunity by multiphoton investigation that revealed differences in the collagen network architecture. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The intestinal stroma morphology and composition has a fundamental role in crypt-villus development and appropriate epithelial cell-lineage compartmentalization. On this base, here we develop an engineered organotypic model of human intestine equivalent in which a functional epithelial/ECM crosstalk is recapitulated. Due to its accessible luminal surface it provides a new platform for preclinical studies of mucosal immunology and bowel inflammation as well as the assessment of pharmaco-toxicity studies.Copyright © 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

Such allergies are triggered by increased antibody production initiated in Peyer's patches (PP). Usually, the presentation of antigens in the lumen of the  to the immune cells of the PP is strongly regulated by the follicle-associated  (FAE) that covers the PP. As the food component caprate has been shown to impede barrier properties in villous , we hypothesized that caprate also affects the barrier function of the PP FAE, thereby possibly contributing a risk factor for the development of food allergies.In this study, we have focused on the effects of caprate on the barrier function of PP, employing in vitro and ex vivo experimental setups to investigate functional and molecular barrier properties. Incubation with caprate induced an increase of transepithelial resistance, and a marked increase of permeability for the paracellular marker fluorescein in porcine PP to 180% of control values. These effects are in accordance with changes in the expression levels of the barrier-forming tight junction proteins tricellulin and claudin-5.This barrier-affecting mechanism could be involved in the initial steps of a food allergy, since it might trigger unregulated contact of the  lumen with antigens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29856808>A lectin of a non-invasive apple snail as an egg defense against predation alters the rat  morphophysiology.</a></h2><p>The eggs of the freshwater Pomacea apple snails develop above the water level, exposed to varied physical and biological stressors. Their high hatching success seems to be linked to their proteins or perivitellins, which surround the developing embryo providing nutrients, sunscreens and varied defenses. The defensive mechanism has been unveiled in P. canaliculata and P. maculata eggs, where their major perivitellins are pigmented, non-digestible and provide a warning coloration while another perivitellin acts as a toxin. In P. scalaris, a species sympatric to the former, the defense strategy seems different, since no toxin was found and the major perivitellin, PsSC, while also colored and non-digestible, is a carbohydrate-binding protein. In this study we examine the structure and function of PsSC by sequencing its subunits, characterizing its carbohydrate binding profile and evaluating its effect on  cells. Whereas cDNA sequencing and database search showed no lectin domain, glycan array carbohydrate binding profile revealed a strong specificity for glycosphingolipids and ABO group antigens. Moreover, PsSC agglutinated bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. Inspired on the defensive properties of seed lectins we evaluated the effects of PsSC on intestinal cells both in vitro (Caco- and IEC-6 cells) and in the gastrointestinal tract of rats. PsSC binds to Caco- cell membranes without reducing its viability, while a PsSC-containing diet temporarily induces large  alterations and an increased absorptive surface. Based on these results, we propose that PsSC is involved in embryo defenses by altering the  morphophysiology of potential predators, a convergent role to plant defensive lectins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30358831>Assessing the respective contributions of dietary flavanol monomers and procyanidins in mediating cardiovascular effects in humans: randomized, controlled, double-masked intervention trial.</a></h2><p>Flavanols are an important class of food bioactives that can improve vascular function even in healthy subjects. Cocoa flavanols (CFs) are composed principally of the monomer (-)-epicatechin (∼20%), with a degree of polymerisation (DP) of 1 (DP1), and oligomeric procyanidins (∼80%, DP2-10).Our objective was to investigate the relative contribution of procyanidins and (-)-epicatechin to CF intake-related improvements in vascular function in healthy volunteers.In a randomized, controlled, double-masked, parallel-group dietary intervention trial, 45 healthy men (aged 18-35 y) consumed the following once daily for 1 mo: 1) a DP1-10 cocoa extract containing 130 mg (-)-epicatechin and 560 mg procyanidins, ) a DP2-10 cocoa extract containing 20 mg (-)-epicatechin and 540 mg procyanidins, or 3) a control capsule, which was flavanol-free but had identical micro- and macronutrient composition.Consumption of DP1-10, but not of either DP2-10 or the control capsule, significantly increased flow-mediated vasodilation (primary endpoint) and the concentration of structurally related (-)-epicatechin metabolites (SREMs) in the circulatory system while decreasing pulse wave velocity and blood pressure. Total cholesterol significantly decreased after daily intake of both DP1-10 and DP2-10 as compared with the control.CF-related improvements in vascular function are predominantly related to the intake of flavanol monomers and circulating SREMs in healthy humans but not to the more abundant procyanidins and  microbiome-derived CF catabolites. Reduction in total cholesterol was linked to consumption of procyanidins but not necessarily to that of (-)-epicatechin.

Various publications on the -brain axis, until 31 July 2017, were screened using the Medline, Google, and Cochrane Library databases. The search was performed using the following keywords: "-brain axis", "-microbiota-brain axis", "nutrition microbiome/microbiota", "enteric nervous system", "enteric glial cells/network", "-brain pathways", "microbiome immune system", "microbiome neuroendocrine system" and "intestinal//enteric neuropeptides". Relevant articles were selected and reviewed.  Tremendous progress has been made in exploring the interactions between nutrients, the microbiome, and the intestinal, -enteric nervous, endocrine and immune systems and the brain. The basis of the -brain axis comprises of an array of multichannel sensing and trafficking pathways that are suggested to convey the enteric signals to the brain. These are mediated by neuroanatomy (represented by the vagal and spinal afferent neurons), the neuroendocrine-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (represented by the  hormones), immune routes (represented by multiple cytokines), microbially-derived neurotransmitters, and finally the gate keepers of the intestinal and brain barriers. Their mutual and harmonious but intricate interaction is essential for human life and brain performance. However, a failure in the interaction leads to a number of inflammatory-, autoimmune-, neurodegenerative-, metabolic-, mood-, behavioral-, cognitive-, autism-spectrum-, stress- and pain-related disorders. The limited availability of information on the mechanisms, pathways and cause-and-effect relationships hinders us from translating and implementing the knowledge from the bench to the clinic.  Further understanding of this intricate field might potentially shed light on novel preventive and therapeutic strategies to combat these disorders. Nutritional approaches, microbiome manipulations, enteric and brain barrier reinforcement and sensing and trafficking modulation might improve physical and mental health outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30575284>Cold chain and virus-free oral polio booster vaccine made in lettuce chloroplasts confers protection against all three poliovirus serotypes.</a></h2><p>To prevent vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis, WHO recommended withdrawal of Oral Polio Vaccine (Serotype-) and a single dose of Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (IPV). IPV however is expensive, requires cold chain, injections and offers limited intestinal mucosal immunity, essential to prevent polio reinfection in countries with open sewer system. To date, there is no virus-free and cold chain-free polio vaccine capable of inducing robust mucosal immunity. We report here a novel low-cost, cold chain/poliovirus-free, booster vaccine using poliovirus capsid protein (VP1, conserved in all serotypes) fused with cholera non-toxic B subunit (CTB) expressed in lettuce chloroplasts. PCR using unique primer sets confirmed site-specific integration of CTB-VP1 transgene cassettes. Absence of the native chloroplast genome in Southern blots confirmed homoplasmy. Codon optimization of the VP1 coding sequence enhanced its expression 9-15-fold in chloroplasts. GM1-ganglioside receptor-binding ELISA confirmed pentamer assembly of CTB-VP1 fusion protein, fulfilling a key requirement for oral antigen delivery through  . Transmission Electron Microscope images and hydrodynamic radius analysis confirmed VP1-VLPs of 22.3 nm size. Mice primed with IPV and boosted three times with lyophilized plant cells expressing CTB-VP1co, formulated with plant-derived oral adjuvants, enhanced VP1-specific IgG1, VP1-IgA titres and neutralization (80%-100% seropositivity of Sabin-1, , 3). In contrast, IPV single dose resulted in <50% VP1-IgG1 and negligible VP1-IgA titres, poor neutralization and seropositivity (<20%, <40% Sabin 1,). Mice orally boosted with CTB-VP1co, without IPV priming, failed to produce any protective neutralizing antibody. Because global population is receiving IPV single dose, booster vaccine free of poliovirus or cold chain offers a timely low-cost solution to eradicate polio.© 2018 The Authors.

Hydrogen sulfide (HS) has emerged as an important mediator of many physiological functions, including gastrointestinal mucosal defense and repair. Hydrogen sulfide is produced by gastrointestinal tract tissues and by bacteria residing within the  and can influence the function of a wide range of cells. The microbiota also appears to be an important target of hydrogen sulfide. HS donors can modify the  microbiota, and the gastrointestinal  is a major site of oxidation of microbial-derived HS. When administered together with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, HS can prevent some of the dysbiosis those drugs induce, possibly contributing to the observed prevention of gastrointestinal damage. Exogenous HS can also markedly reduce the severity of experimental colitis and plays important roles in modulating epithelial cell-mucus-bacterial interactions in the intestine, contributing to its ability to promote resolution of inflammation and repair of tissue injury. In this paper we review recent studies examining the roles of HS in mucosal defense, the possibility that HS can damage the gastrointestinal , and effects of HS on the  microbiota and on mucus and biofilm interactions in the context of intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29124968>Probiotic bacteria cell walls stimulate the activity of the intestinal epithelial cells and macrophage functionality.</a></h2><p>The effect of oral administration of probiotic bacteria cell walls (PBCWs) in the stimulation of the immune system in healthy BALB/c mice was evaluated. We focused our investigation mainly on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) which are essential for coordinating an adequate mucosal immune response and on the functionality of macrophages. The probiotic bacteria and their cell walls were able to stimulate the IECs exhibiting an important activation and cytokine releases. Supplementation with PBCWs promoted macrophage activation from peritoneum and spleen, indicating that the PBCWs oral administration was able to improve the functionality of the macrophages. In addition, the PBCWs increased immunoglobulin A (IgA)-producing cells in the  lamina propria in a similar way to probiotic bacteria, but this supplementation did not have an effect on the population of goblet cells in the small intestine . These results indicate that the probiotic bacteria and their cell walls have an important immunoregulatory effect on the IECs without altering the homeostatic environment but with an increase in IgA+ producing cells and in the innate immune cells, mainly those distant from the  such as spleen and peritoneum. These findings about the capacity of the cell walls from probiotic bacteria to stimulate key cells, such as IECs and macrophages, and to improve the functioning of the immune system, suggest that those structures could be applied as a new oral adjuvant.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30837951>Intestinal Sensing by  Microbiota: Targeting  Peptides.</a></h2><p>There are more than  billion overweight and obese individuals worldwide, surpassing for the first time, the number of people affected by undernutrition. Obesity and its comorbidities inflict a heavy burden on the global economies and have become a serious threat to individuals' wellbeing with no immediate cure available. The causes of obesity are manifold, involving several factors including physiological, metabolic, neural, psychosocial, economic, genetics and the environment, among others. Recent advances in genome sequencing and metagenomic profiling have added another dimension to this complexity by implicating the  microbiota as an important player in energy regulation and the development of obesity. As such, accumulating evidence demonstrate the impact of the  microbiota on body weight, adiposity, glucose, lipid metabolism, and metabolic syndrome. This also includes the role of microbiota as a modulatory signal either directly or through its bioactive metabolites on intestinal lumen by releasing chemosensing factors known to have a major role in controlling food intake and regulating body weight. The importance of  signaling by microbiota signaling is further highlighted by the presence of taste and nutrient receptors on the intestinal  activated by the microbial degradation products as well as their role in release of peptides hormones controlling appetite and energy homeostasis. This review present evidence on how  microbiota interacts with intestinal chemosensing and modulates the release and activity of  peptides, particularly GLP-1 and PYY.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29672156>Ursodeoxycholic acid protects against intestinal barrier breakdown by promoting enterocyte migration via EGFR- and COX--dependent mechanisms.</a></h2><p>The intestinal barrier is often disrupted in disease states, and intestinal barrier failure leads to sepsis. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a bile acid that may protect the intestinal barrier. We hypothesized that UDCA would protect the intestinal  in injury models. To test this hypothesis, we utilized an in vitro wound-healing assay and a mouse model of intestinal barrier injury. We found that UDCA stimulates intestinal epithelial cell migration in vitro, and this migration was blocked by inhibition of cyclooxygenase  (COX-), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or ERK. Furthermore, UDCA stimulated both COX- induction and EGFR phosphorylation. In vivo UDCA protected the intestinal barrier from LPS-induced injury as measured by FITC dextran leakage into the serum. Using 5-bromo-'-deoxyuridine and 5-ethynyl-'-deoxyuridine injections, we found that UDCA stimulated intestinal epithelial cell migration in these animals. These effects were blocked with either administration of Rofecoxib, a COX- inhibitor, or in EGFR-dominant negative Velvet mice, wherein UDCA had no effect on LPS-induced injury. Finally, we found increased COX- and phosphorylated ERK levels in LPS animals also treated with UDCA. Taken together, these data suggest that UDCA can stimulate intestinal epithelial cell migration and protect against acute intestinal injury via an EGFR- and COX--dependent mechanism. UDCA may be an effective treatment to prevent the early onset of -origin sepsis. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study, we show that the secondary bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid stimulates intestinal epithelial cell migration after cellular injury and also protects the intestinal barrier in an acute rodent injury model, neither of which has been previously reported. These effects are dependent on epidermal growth factor receptor activation and downstream cyclooxygenase  upregulation in the small intestine. This provides a potential treatment for acute, -origin sepsis as seen in diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290442>Effects of heat stress and dietary zinc source on performance and mammary epithelial integrity of lactating dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Dietary Zn and heat stress alter  integrity in monogastric animals. However, effects of Zn on mammary epithelial integrity in heat-stressed lactating dairy cows have not been studied. Multiparous lactating Holstein cows (n = 72) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments with a  ×  factorial arrangement to study the effects of environment and Zn source on performance and mammary epithelial integrity. Treatments included  environments [cooled (CL) or not cooled (NC)] and  Zn sources [75 mg/kg of supplemental Zn as Zn hydroxychloride (IOZ) or 35 mg/kg of Zn hydroxychloride + 40 mg/kg of Zn-Met complex (ZMC)]. The experiment was divided into baseline and environmental challenge phases of 84 d each. All cows were cooled during the baseline phase (temperature-humidity index = 72.5), whereas NC cows were not cooled during environmental challenge (temperature-humidity index = 77.7). Mammary biopsies were collected on d 7 and 56 relative to the onset of environmental challenge to analyze gene expression of claudin 1, 4, and 8, zonula occludens 1, , and 3, occludin, and E-cadherin and protein expression of occludin and E-cadherin. Deprivation of cooling increased respiration rate (64.8 vs. 73.9 breaths/min) and vaginal temperature (39.03 vs. 39.94°C) and decreased dry matter intake (26.7 vs. 21.6 kg/d). Energy-corrected milk yield decreased for NC cows relative to CL cows (24.5 vs. 34.1 kg/d). An interaction between environment and Zn source occurred for milk fat content as CL cows fed ZMC had lower milk fat percentage than other groups. Relative to CL cows, NC cows had lower concentrations of lactose (4.69 vs. 4.56%) and solids-not-fat (8.46 vs. 8.32%) but a higher concentration of milk urea nitrogen (9.07 vs. 11.02 mg/mL). Compared with IOZ, cows fed ZMC had lower plasma lactose concentration during baseline and tended to have lower plasma lactose concentration during environmental challenge. Plasma lactose concentration tended to increase at 3, 5, and 41 d after the onset of environmental challenge in NC cows relative to CL cows. Treatment had no effect on milk BSA concentration. Cows fed ZMC tended to have higher gene expression of E-cadherin relative to IOZ. Compared with CL, NC cows had increased gene expression of occludin and E-cadherin and tended to have increased claudin 1 and zonula occludens 1 and  gene expression in the mammary gland. Protein expression of occludin and E-cadherin was unchanged.

However, it is known that ingredients in food can modulate the intestinal barrier, and have the potential to disrupt homeostasis of the . Here, we characterise a conditionally immortalised canine intestinal epithelial cell (cIEC) line for use in in vitro assays, to assess the effect of food ingredients on intestinal barrier function, permeability, cell health, and inflammation. Microscopy and flow cytometry confirmed that cIECs had a phenotype consistent with those of epithelial origin, and were able to differentiate to mature enterocytes. The cIECs also formed a monolayer when grown on Transwell® inserts, producing functional tight junctions between the cells. In contrast to the human-derived Caco- cell line, transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was increased in cIECs in response to two different raw ingredients. The exposure of cIECs to known inflammatory stimuli and raw ingredients induced the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-?B). This work demonstrates the value of a unique cIEC in vitro model to study the effects of food ingredients on canine intestinal function and health, and supports continued efforts to reduce and refine the use of animals in scientific research.2018 FRAME.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626868>Enhancement of the  barrier integrity by a microbial metabolite through the Nrf2 pathway.</a></h2><p>The importance of  microbiota in human health and pathophysiology is undisputable. Despite the abundance of metagenomics data, the functional dynamics of  microbiota in human health and disease remain elusive. Urolithin A (UroA), a major microbial metabolite derived from polyphenolics of berries and pomegranate fruits displays anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-ageing activities. Here, we show that UroA and its potent synthetic analogue (UAS03) significantly enhance  barrier function and inhibit unwarranted inflammation. We demonstrate that UroA and UAS03 exert their barrier functions through activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)- nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  (Nrf2)-dependent pathways to upregulate epithelial tight junction proteins. Importantly, treatment with these compounds attenuated colitis in pre-clinical models by remedying barrier dysfunction in addition to anti-inflammatory activities.

We tested the hypothesis that elevated endocannabinoid activity at cannabinoid CB receptor (CBRs) in the  of mice rendered DIO by chronic access to a high fat and sucrose diet for 60 days inhibits nutrient-induced release of satiation peptides and promotes overeating. Immunoreactivity for CBRs was present in enteroendocrine cells in the mouse's upper small-intestinal  that produce and secrete the satiation peptide, cholecystokinin (CCK), and expression of mRNA for CBRs was greater in these cells when compared to non-CCK producing cells. Oral gavage of corn oil increased levels of bioactive CCK (CCK-8) in plasma from mice fed a low fat no-sucrose diet. Pretreatment with the cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN55,212-, blocked this response, which was reversed by co-administration with the peripherally-restricted CBR neutral antagonist, AM6545. Furthermore, monoacylglycerol metabolic enzyme function was dysregulated in the upper small-intestinal  from DIO mice, which was met with increased levels of a variety of monoacylglycerols including the endocannabinoid, -arachidonoyl--glycerol. Corn oil failed to affect levels of CCK in DIO mouse plasma; however, pretreatment with AM6545 restored the ability for corn oil to stimulate increases in levels of CCK, which suggests that elevated endocannabinoid signaling at small intestinal CBRs in DIO mice inhibits nutrient-induced CCK release. Moreover, the hypophagic effect of AM6545 in DIO mice was reversed by co-administration with the CCK receptor antagonist, devazepide. Collectively, these results provide evidence that hyperphagia associated with DIO is driven by a mechanism that includes CBR-mediated inhibition of -brain satiation signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30451443>Exopolysaccharides Produced by  KL 53A and  Fyos Affect Their Adhesion to Enterocytes.</a></h2><p>Probiotics promote and help to maintain beneficial microbiota composition of the gastrointestinal tract ecosystem and have a positive impact on the host's health. Production of exopolysaccharides is an important feature of probiotic lactobacilli. It increases the chance of their survival in the gastrointestinal tract and promotes adhesion to the ; therefore, exopolysaccharides are important for the process of colonization. Two lactic acid bacteria strains were used in this study: Lactobacillus rhamnosus KL 53A and Lactobacillus casei Fyos. Exopolysaccharides were isolated from bacterial cells and their monosaccharide composition was examined using liquid chromatography. The influence of exopolysaccharides on lactobacilli adhesion to enterocytes was studied after deglycosylation of the bacterial cells and incubation with the selected intestinal microbiota strains that metabolize polysaccharides - Faecalibacterium prausnitzii DSM 17677 and Blautia luti DSM 14534. Both deglycosylation and incubation with polysaccharide metabolizing strains influenced the ability of probiotic strains to adhere to enterocytes. Enzymatic deglycosylation decreased adhesion efficiency of L. rhamnosus KL 53A; however, co-incubation of both lactobacillus strains with F. prausnitzii DSM 17677 resulted in an increase of their adhesion efficiency. Exopolysaccharides are important adhesins of Lactobacillus spp. that influence their ability to colonize  .

Patients with PC who are diagnosed with new-onset diabetes/prediabetes have recently been shown to display significantly lower levels of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) secreted mainly by enteroendocrine cells. We hypothesized that PC-derived exosomes are responsible for the decreased levels of incretins in patients with PC-DM. In this study, exosomes were successfully isolated from PANC-1, MIA PaCa- and SW620 cells and characterized. Only the exosomes from MIA PaCa- cells (Exo-Mia) reduce the production of GIP and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from STC-1 cells in vitro in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, Exo-Mia increased the levels of the Gip and proglucagon mRNAs and decreased the expression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1/3 (PCSK1/3), which is responsible for the post-translational processing of Gip and proglucagon. Furthermore, differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs (miR-6796-3p, miR-6763-5p, miR-4750-3p and miR-197-3p) were identified and considered to be responsible for the inhibitory effects on GIP and GLP-1 production. To further determine the approach of cancer-derived exosomes reaching enteroendocrine cells, we analyzed the uptake and distribution of exosomes in animal model. It was observed that exosomes infused into the intestinal cavity were more easily internalized by the intestinal  than exosomes injected into blood. In conclusion, pancreatic cancer-derived exosomes (Exo-Mia) suppress the synthesis of GIP and GLP-1 from STC-1 cells in vitro by down-regulating the PCSK1/3.

Using Latin hypercube sampling and Monte Carlo simulations for parameter estimation, we fit our model to human immune data from two Shigella EcSf2a- vaccine trials and a rechallenge study in which antibody and B-cell responses against Shigella's lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and O-membrane proteins (OMP) were recorded. The clinically grounded model is used to mathematically investigate which key immune mechanisms and bacterial targets confer immunity against Shigella and to predict which humoral immune components should be elicited to create a protective vaccine against Shigella. The model offers insight into why the EcSf2a- vaccine had low efficacy and demonstrates that at a group level a humoral immune response induced by EcSf2a- vaccine or wild-type challenge against Shigella's LPS or OMP does not appear sufficient for protection. That is, the model predicts an uncontrolled infection of  epithelial cells that is present across all best-fit model parameterizations when fit to EcSf2a- vaccine or wild-type challenge data. Using sensitivity analysis, we explore which model parameter values must be altered to prevent the destructive epithelial invasion by Shigella bacteria and identify four key parameter groups as potential vaccine targets or immune correlates: 1) the rate that Shigella migrates into the lamina propria or , ) the rate that memory B cells (BM) differentiate into antibody-secreting cells (ASC), 3) the rate at which antibodies are produced by activated ASC, and 4) the Shigella-specific BM carrying capacity.

Their potential has recently led to a significant increase in research interest in their effects on the intestine, mainly by reinforcing the intestinal epithelium and modulating the gut microbiota. This study aimed to evaluate the probiotic features of Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 based on adhesive properties for the inhibition of the adhesion of infectious pathogens. The molecular identification of the strain was performed from the sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA with 27FYM and 1492R primers, and its probiotic features, including resistance to gastric juices, resistance to bile salts, and hydrophobicity were evaluated. The potential of Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 to adhere to human adenocarcinoma intestinal cell line, Caco-, as well as the auto and co-aggregation and anti-adherence activity against Escherichia coli were investigated. The results demonstrated that this strain has a desirable potential for passing through the low pH of the stomach and entering the intestines. Moreover, 54% hydrophobicity, 44% auto-aggregation, and 32% co-aggregation were observed for this strain. The adhesion level of Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 to Caco- cells was 12%, and adhered lactobacilli cells were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, this strain showed appropriate anti-adherence effects, including competition, inhibition, and replacement properties against Escherichia coli.

As the most abundant commensal bacteria, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) play important roles in  homeostasis. The microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), an F. prausnitzii metabolite, has anti-inflammatory potential in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thus, we aimed to explore the function and mechanism of MAM on the diabetic intestinal .16S high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the  microbiota of db/db mice (T2DM mouse model). We transfected a FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid into human colonic cells to explore the protein-protein interactions and observe cell monolayer permeability. For in vivo experiments, db/db mice were supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein from E. coli BL21 (DE3).The abundance of F. prausnitzii was downregulated in the  microbiota of db/db mice. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectroscopy (MS) analyses revealed that MAM potentially interacts with proteins in the tight junction pathway, including zona occludens 1 (ZO-1). FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid transfection stabilized the cell permeability and increased ZO-1 expression in NCM460, Caco2, and HT-29 cells. The db/db mice supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein showed restored intestinal barrier function and elevated ZO-1 expression.Our study shows that MAM from F. prausnitzii can restore the intestinal barrier structure and function in DM conditions via the regulation of the tight junction pathway and ZO-1 expression.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the optimal dose and mechanisms behind these effects are not well understood. We investigated the fate of SH6 spores in the  of L. vannamei. Shrimp were divided into six groups administrated with either feed only (negative control) or SH6 spores at 5 × 106 CFU/g pellet (high dose, SH6 spore-H group), 1 × 106 CFU/g pellet (medium dose, SH6 spore-M group),  × 105 CFU/g pellet (low dose, SH6 spore-L group), astaxanthin at 0.5 mg/g pellet (Carophyll group), or carotenoids from SH6 vegetative cells at 5 μg/g pellet (SH6 carotenoid group). The growth rate was highest in SH6 spore-H (3.38%/day), followed by SH6 spore-M (.84%/day) and SH6 spore-L (.25%/day), which was significantly higher than the control (1.45%/day), Carophyll (1.53%/day) or SH6 carotenoid (1.57%/day) groups. The astaxanthin levels (1.9-.0 μg/g shrimp) and red-colour scores (21-22) in SH6 spore-H/M were higher than the control (astaxanthin: 1. μg/g shrimp; red score: 20) or SH6 spore-L, but lower than the Carophyll and SH6 carotenoids. Feeding with medium and high doses of SH6 spores after 28 days resulted in respective 1.3--fold increases in phenol oxidase activity and 8-9 fold increases in Rho mRNA expression compared to the control and low dose group. The live-counts of SH6 in the  gradually increased during the 28-day feeding period with SH6 spores at different concentrations, starting from 4.1, 8., and 5.4 × 104 CFU/g  at day 1 and reaching 5.3, 5.1, and 4.4 × 105 CFU/g  in the SH6-H/M/L groups, respectively, at day 28.  microbiota became more diversified, resulting in a -8-fold increase in total bacterial live-counts compared to the controls. SH6 spore germination was detected by measuring the mRNA expression of a specific sequence coding for SH6 amylase at 4 h, reaching saturation at 24 h. Our results confirm that SH6 spores colonize and germinate in the  to improve the microbial diversity and boost the immune system of shrimp, exhibiting beneficial effects at >1 × 106 CFU/g pellet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203717>Lipopolysaccharides modulate intestinal epithelial permeability and inflammation in a species-specific manner.</a></h2><p>Patients presenting with Inflammatory bowel disease have been shown to exhibit an altered microbiome in both Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis. This shift in the microbial content led us to question whether several of these microbes are important in inflammatory processes present in these diseases and more specifically whether lipopolysaccharides from the gram-negative cell wall differentially stimulates resident cells. We, therefore, investigated the possible contribution of five major species of gram-negative bacteria found to be altered in presence during disease progression and evaluate their pathogenicity through LPS. We demonstrated that LPS from these different species had individual capacities to induce NF-κB and pro-inflammatory IL-8 production from HEK-TLR4 cells in a TLR4 dependent manner. Additional work using human intestinal colonic epithelial cell monolayers (Caco-) demonstrated that the cells responded to the serotype specific LPS in a distinct manner, inducing many inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-10 in significantly altered proportions. Furthermore, the permeability of Caco- monolayers, as a test for their ability to alter intestinal permeability, was also differentially altered by the serotype specific LPS modulating trans-epithelial electrical resistance, small molecule movement, and tight junction integrity. Our results suggest that specific species of bacteria may be potentiating the pathogenesis of IBD and chronic inflammatory diseases through their serotype specific LPS responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30382478>Dietary Zinc-Amino Acid Complex Does Not Affect Markers of Mammary Epithelial Integrity or Heat Stability of Milk in Mid-Lactating Cows.</a></h2><p>Supplying dietary zinc in excess of traditional requirements has clear impacts on the  , but little research has explored whether similar impacts on the mammary  may occur. Our objective was to determine the effects of supplemental Zn sources, in excess of minimal requirements, on markers of mammary epithelial integrity in blood and in milk as well as the heat stability of milk in mid-lactation cows. Twelve multiparous Holstein cows (132 ± 21 days in milk and 51 ± 3 kg/day milk) were blocked according to milk yield and enrolled in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square experiment. Experimental periods were 21 days, with 17 days allowed for diet adaptation and 4 days for sampling. Treatment sequences were randomly assigned to animals and treatments were as follows: (1) 0.97 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO (34.5 mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 30-ZS), () 1.64 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO (56.5 mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 60-ZS), and (3) 0.55 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO plus 1.13 g Zn/day provided as a zinc-methionine complex (58. mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 60-ZM). Treatments were administered once daily as an oral bolus containing all supplemental trace minerals. Rumen-bypass methionine was also included in the 30-ZS and 60-ZS boluses to provide metabolizable methionine equivalent to that provided in 60-ZM rations. Milk samples were assessed for electrolytes, somatic cell transcript abundance of genes related to zinc metabolism, and heat coagulation time. Whole blood samples were analyzed for Na and K concentrations, and plasma samples were analyzed for lactose concentration. Cows fed 60-ZS or 60-ZM had greater zinc intake compared to 30-ZS. Dry matter intake and milk fat content tended to be greater in 60-ZS and 60-ZM cows compared to 30-ZS. Somatic cell linear score was similar among treatments. Treatments neither affected markers of mammary epithelial integrity in blood nor in milk of cows, including plasma concentration of lactose, milk concentrations of Na and K, and SLC30A2 and CLU transcript abundance. Treatments had no effect on milk N fractions or heat coagulation time. This study provided no evidence that supplemental Zn above the established requirements can improve blood-milk epithelial barrier or heat stability of milk in healthy mid-lactation dairy cows.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30367437>[Migraine prophylaxis with a probiotic. Results of an uncontrolled observational study with 1,020 patients].</a></h2><p>Patients with migraine often also suffer from gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease. All these diseases share increased intestinal permeability ("leaky ") and thus increased inflammatory activity. There is an increase in proinflammatoric cytokines in the serum, which in turn can trigger migraine attacks. Probiotics can have a positive effect on the intestinal  and reduce inflammatory activity. A first uncontrolled, small study of 39 migraineurs showed a decrease in the rate of attacks under the daily intake of a probiotic.In an uncontrolled observational study, the influence of a specially formulated multispecies probiotic on the frequency of migraine attacks and the intensity of migraine-associated complaints was recorded. The self-assessment of 1,020 patients was evaluated.Over the treatment period of 8 weeks, the number of headache days was reduced from  to 1.4 days per week. The headache intensity decreased from 5.1 to .1 points (0 = not present to 6 = very intensive). The migraine-associated complaints were reduced and the use of painkillers halved. All results were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.001).It can be suggested that this multispecies probiotic formulation has a positive influence on intensity and frequency of migraine attacks. However, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are required for further confirmation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29340897>Invasion and translocation of uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolated from urosepsis and patients with community-acquired urinary tract infection.</a></h2><p>Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strains are found in high numbers in the  of patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs). We hypothesised that in hospitalised patients, UPEC strains might translocate from the  to the blood stream and that this could be due to the presence of virulence genes (VGs) that are not commonly found in UPEC strains that cause UTI only. To test this, E. coli strains representing 75 dominant clonal groups of UPEC isolated from the blood of hospitalised patients with UTI (urosepsis) (n = 22), hospital-acquired (HA) UTI without blood infection (n = 24) and strains isolated from patients with community-acquired (CA)-UTIs (n = 29) were tested for their adhesion to, invasion and translocation through Caco- cells, in addition to the presence of 34 VGs associated with UPEC. Although there were no differences in the rate and degree of translocation among the groups, urosepsis and HA-UTI strains showed significantly higher abilities to adhere (P = 0.0095 and P < 0.0001 respectively) and invade Caco- cells than CA-UTI isolates (P = 0.0044, P = 0.0048 respectively). Urosepsis strains also carried significantly more VGs than strains isolated from patients with only UTI and/or CA-UTI isolates. In contrast, the antigen 43 allele RS218 was found more commonly among CA-UTI strains than in the other two groups. These data indicate that UPEC strains, irrespective of their source, are capable of translocating through  . However, urosepsis and HA-UTI strains have a much better ability to interact with  epithelia and have a greater virulence potential than CA-UPEC, which allows them to cause blood infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31495063>Protease-activated receptor signaling in intestinal permeability regulation.</a></h2><p>Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a unique class of G-protein-coupled transmembrane receptors, which revolutionized the perception of proteases from degradative enzymes to context-specific signaling factors. Although PARs are traditionally known to affect several vascular responses, recent investigations have started to pinpoint the functional role of PAR signaling in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This organ is exposed to the highest number of proteases, either from the  lumen or from the mucosa. Luminal proteases include the host's digestive enzymes and the proteases released by the commensal microbiota, while mucosal proteases entail extravascular clotting factors and the enzymes released from resident and infiltrating immune cells. Active proteases and, in case of a disrupted  barrier, even entire microorganisms are capable to translocate the intestinal , particularly under inflammatory conditions. Especially PAR-1 and PAR-, expressed throughout the GI tract, impact  permeability regulation, a major factor affecting intestinal physiology and metabolic inflammation. In addition, PARs are critically involved in the onset of inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, and tumor progression. Due to the number of proteases involved and the multiple cell types affected, selective regulation of intestinal PARs represents an interesting therapeutic strategy. The analysis of tissue/cell-specific knockout animal models will be of crucial importance to unravel the intrinsic complexity of this signaling network. Here, we provide an overview on the implication of PARs in intestinal permeability regulation under physiologic and disease conditions.© 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, the present study evaluated the effect of high-grain feeding persistence on the absorption kinetics of reticuloruminal SCFA, gene expression in the rumen , and the associated shifts in the epithelial bacteria in cows recovering from either a long-term continuous high-grain feeding model or a long-term transient high-grain feeding model. In a crossover study design, 8 nonlactating Holstein cows were fed 60% concentrate either continuously for 4 wk (continuous) or with a 1-wk break in the second week of the high-grain feeding (transient). After the high-grain feeding, all animals were fed a diet of 100% forage (recovery) for an additional 8 wk. Rumen papilla biopsies and SCFA absorption measurements were taken at the start of the trial (baseline), after the 4-wk high-grain feeding (49 d), after -wk recovery forage feeding (63 d), and after 8-wk recovery forage (105 d). Absorption of SCFA was determined in vivo using the washed and isolated reticulorumen technique. Rumen papillae biopsies were used for adherent bacterial DNA and host RNA extraction. The epithelial bacteria were determined using Illumina MiSeq (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland) sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. No significant effects of the high-grain feeding model were seen for bacterial diversity. However, bacterial diversity increased with time spent in the recovery forage feeding period regardless of feeding model. The relative abundance of Acidobacteria phyla and Acetivibrio spp. increased when animals were fed a transient high-grain feeding model. A trend toward increased CLDN4 expression was observed in the continuous model. Furthermore, there were interactions between feeding model and sampling day for gene targets CD14, DRA, NHE2, NHE3, and MCT2. When comparing length of recovery, in the continuous model increased relative absorption of SCFA was sustained at 63 d but dropped to baseline measurements at 105 d. A similar pattern was found with the transient model but it did not reach significance. The only gene target that was found to significantly correlate to relative absorption of SCFA was DRA (correlation coefficient ≤ -0.41). Whereas, genera Alkalibaculum, Anaerorhabdus, Coprococcus, and Dethiobacter all showed positive correlations to gene targets for pH regulation (NHE2 and NHE3) and SCFA uptake (MCT1) but negative correlations to SCFA absorption. We conclude that while the rumen absorption and epithelial bacteria were able to recover to baseline levels after 8 wk of forage feeding, the time needed for re-establishment of homeostasis in host gene expression is longer, especially when high-grain feeding is interrupted.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

We aimed to assess the timeline, location and patterns of recurrence following CRIM to inform these guidelines.Data on patients undergoing RFA for BE were obtained from prospectively maintained databases of five (three USA and two UK) tertiary referral centres. RFA was performed until CRIM was confirmed on two consecutive endoscopies.594 patients achieved CRIM as of 1 May 2017. 151 subjects developed recurrent BE over a median (IQR) follow-up of .8 (1.4-4.4) years. There was 19% cumulative recurrence risk of any BE within  years and an additional 49% risk over the next 8.6 years. There was no evidence of a clinically meaningful change in the recurrence hazard rate of any BE, dysplastic BE or high-grade dysplasia/cancer over the duration of follow-up, with an estimated % (95% CI -7% to 12%) change in recurrence rate of any BE in a doubling of follow-up time. 74% of BE recurrences developed at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) (24.1% were dysplastic) and 26% in the tubular oesophagus. The yield of random biopsies from the tubular oesophagus, in the absence of visible lesions, was 1% (BE) and 0.% (dysplasia).BE recurrence risk following CRIM remained constant over time, suggesting that lengthening of follow-up intervals, at least in the first 5 years after CRIM, may not be advisable. Sampling the GOJ is critical to detecting recurrence. The requirement for random biopsies of the neosquamous  in the absence of visible lesions may need to be re-evaluated.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

Although fetal LGR5-expressing cells can give rise to adult intestinal stem cells, it remains unclear whether this population in the patterned  represents unique intestinal stem-cell precursors. Here we show, using unbiased quantitative lineage-tracing approaches, biophysical modelling and intestinal transplantation, that all cells of the mouse intestinal -irrespective of their location and pattern of LGR5 expression in the fetal  tube-contribute actively to the adult intestinal stem cell pool. Using 3D imaging, we find that during fetal development the villus undergoes gross remodelling and fission. This brings epithelial cells from the non-proliferative villus into the proliferative intervillus region, which enables them to contribute to the adult stem-cell niche. Our results demonstrate that large-scale remodelling of the intestinal wall and cell-fate specification are closely linked. Moreover, these findings provide a direct link between the observed plasticity and cellular reprogramming of differentiating cells in adult tissues following damage, revealing that stem-cell identity is an induced rather than a hardwired property.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632575>Non-invasive sensing of transepithelial barrier function and tissue differentiation in organs-on-chips using impedance spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Here, we describe methods for combining impedance spectroscopy measurements with electrical simulation to reveal transepithelial barrier function and tissue structure of human intestinal  cultured inside an organ-on-chip microfluidic culture device. When performing impedance spectroscopy measurements, electrical simulation enabled normalization of cell layer resistance of  cultured statically in a -on-a-chip, which enabled determination of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values that can be compared across device platforms. During culture under dynamic flow, the formation of intestinal villi was accompanied by characteristic changes in impedance spectra both measured experimentally and verified with simulation, and we demonstrate that changes in cell layer capacitance may serve as measures of villi differentiation. This method for combining impedance spectroscopy with simulation can be adapted to better monitor cell layer characteristics within any organ-on-chip in vitro and to enable direct quantitative TEER comparisons between organ-on-chip platforms which should help to advance research on organ function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647994>Palmitic acid damages   integrity and initiates inflammatory cytokine production.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms leading to the low-grade inflammation observed during obesity are not fully understood. Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1-5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and oleic acid. Saturated palmitic acid impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated oleic acid did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic acid induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting barrier integrity and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the  alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Whereas several studies report an increase in mast cell density during IBD, others found a decrease. Recently, we observed a reduced response to mast cell degranulation induced by antigen contact in a colitis model. As the effects of mast cell mediators on epithelial ion transport are mediated indirectly via stimulation of secretomotor neurons, we investigated in vitro whether proinflammatory cytokines change the response to mast cell degranulation. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and a mix of proinflammatory cytokines caused an increase of short-circuit current (I) and tissue conductance in rat colon. Anion secretion induced by histamine was downregulated in the presence of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and the cytokine mix, whereas the response to the mast cell stimulator compound 48/80 was not changed significantly. In a coculture of rat submucosal ganglionic cells with a mast cell line (RBL-2H3), TNFα preincubation for 1 d increased the percentage of neurons responding to mast cell degranulation with an increase of the cytosolic Ca concentration and enhanced the amplitude of this response. Consequently, the downregulation of epithelial secretion is compensated by an increased sensitivity of secretomotor neurons leading to a constant response of the  to compound 48/80. Furthermore, enteric neurons can modify mast cell functions as nicotine inhibited the increase in cytosolic Ca concentration of RBL-2H3 cells and the I evoked by compound 48/80. Consequently, these in vitro models deliver new insights into cellular interactions in the  wall under inflammatory conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To establish a persistent infection, the bacteria have to cope with hostile surroundings when they transmigrate through the intestinal  and colonize underlying -associated lymphatic tissues. How the bacteria gain a foothold in the face of host immune responses is poorly understood. Here, we show that the CNFY toxin, which enhances translocation of the antiphagocytic Yop effectors, induces inflammatory responses. This results in extensive tissue destruction, alteration of the intestinal microbiota and bacterial clearance. Suppression of CNFY function, however, increases interferon-γ-mediated responses, comprising non-inflammatory antimicrobial activities and tolerogenesis. This process is accompanied by a preterm reprogramming of the pathogen's transcriptional response towards persistence, which gives the bacteria a fitness edge against host responses and facilitates establishment of a commensal-type life style.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31071306>Effects of Serotonin and Slow-Release 5-Hydroxytryptophan on Gastrointestinal Motility in a Mouse Model of Depression.</a></h2><p>Mood disorders and constipation are often comorbid, yet their shared etiologies have rarely been explored. The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) regulates central nervous system and enteric nervous system (ENS) development and long-term functions, including gastrointestinal (GI) motility and mood. Therefore, defects in neuron production of 5-HT might result in brain and intestinal dysfunction. Tryptophan hydroxylase  (TPH2) is the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT biosynthesis. A variant of TPH2 that encodes the R441H substitution (TPH2-R441H) was identified in individuals with severe depression. We studied mice with an analogous mutation (TPH2-R439H), which results in a 60%-80% decrease in levels of 5-HT in the central nervous system and behaviors associated with depression in humans. Feeding chow that contains 5-HTP slow release (5-HTP SR) to TPH2-R439H mice restores levels of 5-HT in the central nervous system and reduces depressive-like behaviors.We compared the effects of feeding chow, with or without 5-HTP SR, to mice with the TPH2-R439H mutation and without this mutation (control mice). Myenteric and submucosal plexuses were isolated from all 4 groups of mice, and immunocytochemistry was used to quantify total enteric neurons, serotonergic neurons, and 5-HT-dependent subsets of neurons. We performed calcium imaging experiments to evaluate responses of enteric neurons to tryptamine-evoked release of endogenous 5-HT. In live mice, we measured total GI transit, gastric emptying, small intestinal transit, and propulsive colorectal motility. To measure colonic migrating motor complexes (CMMCs), we isolated colons and constructed spatiotemporal maps along the proximodistal length to quantify the frequency, velocity, and length of CMMCs. We measured villus height, crypt perimeter, and relative densities of enterochromaffin and enteroendocrine cells in small intestinal tissue.Levels of 5-HT were significantly lower in enteric neurons from TPH2-R439H mice than from control mice. TPH2-R439H mice had abnormalities in ENS development and ENS-mediated GI functions, including reduced motility and intestinal epithelial growth. Total GI transit and propulsive colorectal motility were slower in TPH2-R439H mice than controls, and CMMCs were slower and less frequent. Villus height and crypt perimeter were significantly decreased in colon tissues from TPH2-R439H mice compared with controls. Administration of 5-HTP SR to adult TPH2-R439H mice restored 5-HT to enteric neurons and reversed these abnormalities. Adult TPH2-R439H mice given oral 5-HTP SR had normalized numbers of enteric neurons, total GI transit, and colonic motility. Intestinal tissue from these mice had normal measures of CMMCs and enteric epithelial growth CONCLUSIONS: In studies of TPH2-R439H mice, we found evidence for reduced release of 5-HT from enteric neurons that results in defects in ENS development and GI motility. Our findings indicate that neuron production of 5-HT links constipation with mood dysfunction. Administration of 5-HTP SR to mice restored 5-HT to the ENS and normalized GI motility and growth of the enteric . 5-HTP SR might be used to treat patients with intestinal dysfunction associated with low levels of 5-HT.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables, has been proven to be highly effective in inhibiting cancer. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential roles of the  microbiota in the inhibition of BBN-induced bladder cancer by SFN.N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine is used to induce bladder cancer in male C57BL/6 mice, with or without SFN for 23 weeks. SFN ameliorates the histological changes characteristic of bladder cancer, resulting in fewer submucosal capillaries. SFN normalizes  microbiota dysbiosis in mice with BBN-induced bladder cancer with a significant increase in Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium cluster I. SFN also increases butyric acid levels in the mouse colon, and repairs the injury to the mucosal  of the colon and cecum through the upregulation of the expression of tight junction proteins and GLP2. SFN greatly decreases the release of cytokines (IL-6) and secretory immunoglobulin A in the mice with bladder cancer.These results suggest that SFN protects against chemical-induced bladder cancer through normalizing the composition of  microbiota and repairing the physiological destruction of the  barrier, as well as decreasing inflammation and the immune response.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Emerging evidence reveals that trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a  microbiota-generated metabolite, is involved in the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular diseases. Circulating TMAO is elevated in CKD. Here we tested the hypothesis that elevated TMAO plays a contributory role in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in CKD. Rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy to induce CKD or sham operation, and were treated with 1.0% 3,3-Dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB, an inhibitor of trimethylamine formation) or vehicle. Eight weeks after nephrectomy and DMB treatment, circulating TMAO levels were markedly elevated in CKD-vehicle rats compared with sham-vehicle rats, but were reduced in CKD-DMB rats. Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation was impaired in CKD-vehicle rats compared with sham-vehicle rats as indicated by reduced maximal relaxation (E) and decreased area under the curve (AUC). E and AUC were both normalized in CKD-DMB rats. No difference in sodium nitroprusside-induced endothelial-independent vasodilation was observed across groups. Molecular studies revealed that endothelial nitric-oxide synthase activity was decreased, while superoxide production and proinflammatory cytokine expression were increased in the aorta of CKD-vehicle rats compared with sham-vehicle rats. Of note, the abnormalities in above molecular parameters were completely restored in CKD-DMB rats. These results suggest that CKD elevates circulating TMAO levels, which may reduce eNOS-derived NO production by increasing vascular oxidative stress and inflammation, contributing to CKD-associated endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A melatonin production independent of the photoperiod is typical of the . However, the local physiological role of melatonin at the intestinal tract is poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory activities of melatonin in an in vitro model of inflamed intestinal . To this purpose, we assessed different parameters usually associated with intestinal inflammation using IL-1β-stimulated Caco- cells. Differentiated monolayers of Caco- cells were preincubated with melatonin (1 nmol/L-50 μmol/L) and then exposed to IL-1β. After each treatment, different inflammatory mediators, DNA-breakage, and global DNA methylation status were assayed. To evaluate the involvement of melatonin membrane receptors, we also exposed differentiated monolayers to melatonin in the presence of luzindole, a MT1 and MT2 antagonist. Our results showed that melatonin, at concentrations similar to those obtained in the lumen  after ingestion of dietary supplements for the treatment of sleep disorders, was able to attenuate the inflammatory response induced by IL-1β. Anti-inflammatory effects were expressed as both a decrease of the levels of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IL-8, COX-, and NO, and a reduced increase in paracellular permeability. Moreover, the protection was associated with a reduced NF-κB activation and a prevention of DNA demethylation. Conversely, luzindole did not reverse the melatonin inhibition of stimulated-IL-6 release. In conclusion, our findings suggest that melatonin, through a local action, can modulate inflammatory processes at the intestinal level, offering new opportunities for a multimodal management of IBD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The underlying interactions are multilayered, and the cellular responses are modulated by the local environment. The intestine is a particularly interesting tissue regarding host-pathogen interaction. It is densely colonized by commensal microbes and a portal of entry for ingested pathogens. This necessitates constant monitoring of microbial stimuli in order to maintain homeostasis during encounters with benign microbiota and to trigger immune defenses in response to bacterial pathogens. Homeostasis is maintained by physical barriers (the mucus layer and ), chemical defenses (antimicrobial peptides), and innate immune responses (NLRC4 inflammasome), which keep the bacteria from reaching the sterile lamina propria. Intestinal pathogens represent potent experimental tools to probe these barriers and decipher how pathogens can circumvent them. The streptomycin mouse model of oral  serovar Typhimurium infection provides a well-characterized, robust experimental system for such studies. Strikingly, each stage of the  tissue infection poses a different set of challenges to the pathogen and requires tight control of virulence factor expression, host response modulation, and cooperation between phenotypic subpopulations. Therefore, successful infection of the intestinal tissue relies on a delicate and dynamic balance between responses of the pathogen and its host. These mechanisms can be deciphered to their full extent only in realistic  infection models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257542>Impact of chronic immobilization stress on parameters of colonic homeostasis in BALB/c mice.</a></h2><p>The intestinal  is a monolayer of cells arranged side‑by‑side and connected by tight junction (TJ) proteins expressed at the apical extreme of the paracellular membrane. This layer prevents stress‑induced inflammatory responses, thus helping to maintain  barrier function and  homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of chronic immobilization stress on the colonic expression of various parameters of homeostasis. A total of two groups of female BALB/c mice (n=6) were included: A stressed group (short‑term immobilization for  h/day for 4 consecutive days) and an unstressed (control) group. Colon samples were obtained to detect neutrophils and goblet cells by optical microscopy, TJ protein expression (occludin, and claudin ‑, ‑4, ‑7, ‑12 and ‑15) by western blotting, mRNA levels of TJ genes and proinflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β, ‑6 and ‑8] by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR, fecal lactoferrin by ELISA and the number of colony‑forming units of aerobic bacteria. Compared with goblet cells in control mice, goblet cells were enlarged and reduced in number in stressed mice, whereas neutrophil cellularity was unaltered. Stressed mice exhibited reduced mRNA expression for all evaluated TJ mRNAs, with the exception of claudin‑7, which was upregulated. Protein levels of occludin and all claudins (with the exception of claudin‑12) were decreased in stressed mice. Fecal lactoferrin, proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels and aerobic bacterial counts were all increased in the stressed group. These results indicated that immobilization stress induced proinflammatory and potential remodeling effects in the colon by decreasing TJ protein expression. The present study may be a useful reference for therapies aiming to regulate the effects of stress on intestinal inflammatory dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29417892>Drosophila Peptide Hormones Allatostatin A and Diuretic Hormone 31 Exhibiting Complementary Gradient Distribution in Posterior Midgut Antagonistically Regulate Midgut Senescence and Adult Lifespan.</a></h2><p>Enteroendocrine cells (EEs) are evolutionarily conserved gastrointestinal secretory cells that show scattered distribution in the intestinal . These cells classified into several subtypes based on the hormones they produce in both mammals and insects. In the fruit fly Drosophila, it has been suggested that nearly equal numbers of two subtypes of EEs (Allatostatin A: AstA and Diuretic hormone 31 : Dh31) are alternately produced from the intestinal stem cells in the posterior midgut. However, we found that these two subtypes are not always present in this manner, but are rather distributed in a complementary frequency gradient along the posterior midgut. We show that midgut-preferential RNA knockdown of the peptide hormones AstA or Dh31 respectively results in decreased or increased adult lifespan. This effect on longevity is apparently correlated with the midgut senescence phenotypes as a result of direct hormone action through both hormone receptors expressed in the enteroblasts or other midgut cell types. However,  senescence does not appear to be the direct cause for longevity regulation, as knockdown of both hormone receptors did not affect adult lifespan. Furthermore, these senescence phenotypes appear to be independent of insulin signaling and manifest in an organ-specific manner. These results indicate that the two intestinal secretory peptides antagonistically regulate adult lifespan and intestinal senescence through multiple pathways, irrespective of insulin, which implicates a complementary gradient distribution of each of the hormone-producing EEs, consistent with local requirements for cell activity along the posterior midgut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31350458>Antibody responses to flagellin C and Streptococcus gallolyticus pilus proteins in colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>Antibodies to Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus (SGG) have been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). Because SGG may correlate with impaired  epithelia, we assessed the association of antibodies to bacterial flagellin C (FliC), a measure potentially related to this impairment, with CRC and the CRC-specific interaction with antibodies to SGG proteins. Antibodies to FliC and SGG pilus proteins Gallo2178 and Gallo2179 were measured in two independent studies, a combined study from Nijmegen and Detroit (93 CRC cases, 74 controls) and a replication data set including 576 cases and 576 controls from the Spanish multicenter multicase-control study (MCC-Spain). Logistic regression was applied to assess whether antibodies to FliC were associated with CRC and modified the association of antibodies to SGG proteins with CRC. Antibodies to FliC were associated with those to SGG Gallo2178 among CRC cases, resulting in an interaction in the association of antibodies to Gallo2178 with CRC (p = 0.007). This association was only present among individuals with high antibody responses to FliC (OR: .42, 95% CI: 1.45-4.06).

In disease such as cancer, cells acquire an upregulated migratory capacity that leads to their dissemination throughout the body. Live imaging of cell migration allows for better understanding of cell behaviors in development, adult tissue homeostasis and disease. We have optimized live imaging procedures to track cell migration in adult murine tissue explants derived from: (1) healthy ; () primary intestinal carcinoma; and (3) the liver, a common metastatic site. To track epithelial cell migration in the , we generated an inducible fluorescent reporter mouse, enabling us to visualize and track individual cells in unperturbed  . To image intratumoral cancer cells, we use a spontaneous intestinal cancer model based on the activation of Notch1 and deletion of p53 in the mouse intestinal , which gives rise to aggressive carcinoma. Interaction of cancer cells with a metastatic niche, the mouse liver, is addressed using a liver colonization model. In summary, we describe a method for long-term 3D imaging of tissue explants by two-photon excitation microscopy.

Interleukin-13 signals through IL-13 receptor α-1 ( (gene) and IL13Rα1 (protein)), a receptor that can be regulated by microRNAs (miRs). MicroRNAs are small non-coding single-stranded RNAs with a role in several pathologies. However, their relevance in the pathophysiology of UC, a chronic inflammatory condition of the colonic mucosa, is poorly characterised. Here, we determined the expression of IL13Rα1 in UC, its potential regulation by miRs and the subsequent effect on IL-13 signalling. Inflamed mucosa of UC patients showed decreased mRNA and protein expression of  when compared to healthy controls. We show that miR-31 and miR-155 are upregulated in inflamed UC mucosa and that both directly target the 3' untranslated region of  mRNA. Transfection of miR-31 and miR-155 mimics reduced the expression of  mRNA and protein, and blocked IL-13-dependent phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) in HT-29 cells, a   cell line. Interleukin-13 activation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 () and eotaxin-3 ( expression was also diminished. MicroRNA-31/microRNA-155 mimics also downregulated  in ex vivo human inflamed UC biopsies.

Dysregulation of this protective barrier is a primary driver of inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's and ulcerative colitis) and also infant gastrointestinal infections. Previously, our lab reported that hyaluronan (HA) isolated from human milk induces the expression of the antimicrobial peptide β-defensin in vivo and protects against Salmonella Typhimurium infection of epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, we demonstrated that commercially available 35 kDa size HA induces the expression of β-defensin, upregulates the expression of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and attenuates murine Citrobacter rodentium infection in vivo. In this current study, we report that HA35 remains largely intact and biologically active during transit through the digestive tract where it directly induces β-defensin expression upon epithelial cell contact. We also demonstrate HA35 abrogation of murine Salmonella Typhimurium infection as well as downregulation of leaky tight junction protein claudin- expression. Taken together, we propose a dual role for HA in host innate immune defense at the epithelial cell surface, acting to induce antimicrobial peptide production and also block pathogen-induced leaky . HA35 is therefore a promising therapeutic in the defense against bacterially induced colitis in compromised adults and vulnerable newborns.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31235766>Neutrophil GM-CSF signaling in inflammatory bowel disease patients is influenced by non-coding genetic variants.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil dysfunction and GM-CSF auto-antibodies are observed in pediatric and adult patients with Crohn's disease (CD). We associated damaging coding variants with low GM-CSF induced STAT5 stimulation index (GMSI) in pediatric CD patients and implicated variation of neutrophil GM-CSF signaling in cell function and disease complications. Because many CD patients with low GMSI do not carry damaging coding mutations, we sought to test the hypothesis that non-coding variants contribute to this phenotype. We enrolled, performed whole genome sequencing, and measured the GMSI in 77 CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (24 low and 53 normal GMSI). We identified 4 non-coding variants (rs3808851, rs10974787, rs10974788 and rs10974789) in RCL1 significantly associated with variation of GMSI level (p < 0.011). They were validated in two independent cohorts with: RNAseq data (n = 50) and blood eQTL dataset (n = 31,684). These variants are in LD and affect expression of JAK2 (p 0.005 to 0.013), RCL1 (p 8.17E-13 to .98E-11) and AK3 (p .00E-68 to 3.03E-55) genes. Additionally, they influence proteins involved in differentiation of  , inflammation, and immune system regulation. In summary, our study outlines the contribution of non-coding variants in neutrophil GM-CSF signaling and the potential importance of RCL1 and AK3 in CD pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655271>Novel human NKCC1 mutations cause defects in goblet cells mucus secretion and chronic inflammation.</a></h2><p>Infections due to intestinal yeast and bacteria affect a large number of patients with deficits in absorptive or secretory epithelial transport mechanisms. The basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) has been implicated in intestinal epithelial fluid secretion. Two patients with deleterious heterozygous (NKCC1-DFX) or homozygous (Kilquist) mutations in SLC12A2 (NKCC1) suffer from gastrointestinal deficits. Due to chronic infections, the colon and the small intestine of the NKCC1-DFX patient were surgically resected.To investigate how NKCC1 affects the integrity and function of the  epithelia, we used a mouse model recapitulating the NKCC1-DFX patient mutation. Electron microscopy and immunostaining were used to analyze the integrity of the colonic mucus layers and immune cells infiltration. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on the distal colon sections to measure bacteria translocation to the mucosa and submucosa. Citrobacter rodentium was used to measure mouse ability to clear enteric infection. Multiplex cytokine assay was used to analyze mouse inflammatory response to infection.We show that NKCC1-DFX expression causes defective goblet cells mucus granule exocytosis, leading to secretion of intact granules into the lumen of the large intestine. In addition, NKCC1-DFX colon submucosal glands secrete mucus that remained attached to the . Importantly, expression of the mutant NKCC1 or complete loss of NKCC1 function leads to aggravated inflammatory response to Citrobacter rodentium infection. Compared to wild-type, NKCC1-DFX mice showed decreased expression of claudin-, a tight junction protein involved in paracellular Na and water transport and enteric infection clearance.Our data indicate that NKCC1-DFX impairs  barrier function by affecting mucus secretion and immune properties.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

As a clinically frequent disease, it can affect individuals throughout their lives, with multiple complications. Glucagon-like peptide  (GLP-) is a potent -specific intestinal growth factor. However, native GLP- has a relatively short half-life in human circulation because of extensive renal clearance and rapid degradation by the proteolytic enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV). Previously, We prepared a recombinant GLP- variant (GLP-②), which has increased half-life and activity as compared to the [Gly]GLP- monomer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective potential of GLP-② in IBD models. LPS-induced in vitro model and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced in vivo model were used to study the anti-inflammatory and therapeutic effect of GLP-②. We found that treated with GLP-② showed a significantly reduction in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, GLP-② alleviated symptoms of DSS-induced colitis. GLP-② treated mice displayed an increase in body weight, lower colitis scores, and fewer mucosal damage compared with GLP- treated mice. MPO activities, protein expression of NLRP3 and COX2 in the colon tissues were significantly reduced in GLP-② groups. Importantly, the ameliorative effect of GLP-② was related to anti-apoptosis effect in colon tissues. These findings demonstrated that GLP-② may offer a superior therapeutic benefit over [Gly]GLP- monomer for treatment of IBD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This inflammation was associated with genotoxic damage and NF-кB activation. Exposure of SW480 cells to PCB 153 led to similar effects as seen in vivo.

In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the  microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the  , inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the  microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to M2 pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with probiotics. Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of oleic acid, which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore we examined the digestive tract features of Pachypterus khavalchor using morphological, osteological, histological and histochemical techniques to comprehend and relate structural organization of digestive tract with scale eating habit. Morphologically, the alimentary canal is defined by a short and muscular esophagus, well-developed stomach and comparatively short intestine.  content analysis and intestinal coefficient value (0.53 ± 0.01) revealed that P. khavalchor exhibit both carnivory and lepidophagy. However, P. khavalchor primarily feeds on the scales (67.47%) and other chitin-rich material like aquatic insects (17.62%), aquatic larvae (8.66%) which affirms its solid association with chitinase producing endosymbionts in the . Lepidophagy is further supported by the osteological observations. The perfect segregation of the functions such as food capture, ingestion and processing amongst the different types of teeth located in the oral cavity and pharyngeal region thus could be taken as evolutionary adaptations in scale eaters to support lepidophagy. Specialized arrangement of the esophageal and stomach epithelial folds could be altogether taken as an adaptation with the end goal to frame the scale stacks and accordingly facilitate the handling and processing of chitin-rich bolus. The esophageal mucosa is simple squamous  instead of stratified  with numerous goblet cells to withstand the mechanical harm by hard-food stuff like scales. The cardiac and fundic regions exhibited large number tubular gastric glands with simple columnar . Surface cells of all three stomach regions stained positive for PAS staining.

We believe that immune cells respond to leakage of "toxic lymph" following trauma causing the attraction of these cells to the perilymphatic space. To test this, we utilized a model of burn on rats to examine changes in a single immune cell population associated with mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction. We examined the ability of serum from these animals to increase permeability in lymphatic endothelial monolayers and disrupt cellular junctions. We also treated burn animals with doxycycline, an inhibitor of microvascular permeability, and observed the effects on immune cell populations, morphometry, and lymphatic endothelial permeability. Burn injury increased the number of MHCII immune cells along the vessel (>50%). The size and shape of these cells also changed significantly following burn injury. Serum from burn animals increased lymphatic endothelial permeability (∼1.5-fold) and induced breaks in VE-cadherin staining. Doxycycline treatment blocked the accumulation of immune cells along the vessel, whereas serum from doxycycline-treated animals failed to increase lymphatic endothelial permeability. The size of cells along the vessel in doxycycline-treated burn animals was not affected, suggesting that the cells already present on the lymphatic vessels still respond to substances in the lymph. These findings suggest that factors produced during burn can induce lymphatic endothelial barrier disruption and lymph produced during traumatic injury can influence the attraction and morphology of immune cell populations along the vessel.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29953253>Lipid malabsorption from altered hormonal signaling changes early  microbial responses.</a></h2><p>Infants with congenital diarrheal disorders caused by enteroendocrine cell dysgenesis, or the loss of intestinal endocrine cells, causes severe malabsorptive diarrhea, though the mechanism is not fully understood. The transcription factor "aristaless-related homeobox" (Arx) is specifically expressed in intestinal endocrine cells. This study seeks to characterize the early malabsorptive phenotype of mice deficient for Arx using cell-type specific gene ablation in Villin-Cre; Arx ( Arx) mice. In neonatal mice, the loss of intestinal Arx caused the loss of intestinal hormones, such as cholecystokinin, secretin, neurotensin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and GLP- but also upregulation of somatostatin. Arx mice exhibited steatorrhea with the loss of lipid transport in duodenal enterocytes, upregulation of lysozyme-positive Paneth cells, and a secondary increase in antimicrobial peptides, specifically Reg3β. When the  from Arx mice was cultured ex vivo into enteroids, however, the Reg3β upregulation was lost under the sterile conditions. Thus, Arx is required for the appropriate lineage allocation of multiple enteroendocrine subtypes. We concluded that altered hormonal signaling caused by Arx deficiency results in lipid malabsorption, premature Paneth cell differentiation, and an inflammatory response, including neutrophilic infiltrates and a microbiota-triggered upregulation of Reg3β. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The enteroendocrine transcription factor aristaless-related homeobox (Arx) plays a key role in lineage specification. Changes in hormonal expression mediated by Arx lead to lipid malabsorption and premature Paneth cell development. Furthermore, global profiling of whole intestine from Arx-deficient mice revealed significant upregulation of antimicrobial peptides. This antimicrobial response in Arx-deficient animals is lost under sterile culture conditions of enteroids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30443019>Control and dysregulation of redox signalling in the gastrointestinal tract.</a></h2><p>Redox signalling in the gastrointestinal mucosa is held in an intricate balance. Potent microbicidal mechanisms can be used by infiltrating immune cells, such as neutrophils, to protect compromised mucosae from microbial infection through the generation of reactive oxygen species. Unchecked, collateral damage to the surrounding tissue from neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species can be detrimental; thus, maintenance and restitution of a breached intestinal mucosal barrier are paramount to host survival. Redox reactions and redox signalling have been studied for decades with a primary focus on contributions to disease processes. Within the past decade, an upsurge of exciting findings have implicated subtoxic levels of oxidative stress in processes such as maintenance of mucosal homeostasis, the control of protective inflammation and even regulation of tissue wound healing. Resident  microbial communities have been shown to trigger redox signalling within the mucosa, which expresses similar but distinct enzymes to phagocytes. At the fulcrum of this delicate balance is the colonic mucosal , and emerging evidence suggests that precise control of redox signalling by these barrier-forming cells may dictate the outcome of an inflammatory event. This Review will address both the spectrum and intensity of redox activity pertaining to host-immune and host-microbiota crosstalk during homeostasis and disease processes in the gastrointestinal tract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29208693>Dysregulation of junctional adhesion molecule-A contributes to ethanol-induced barrier disruption in intestinal epithelial cell monolayers.</a></h2><p>Alcohol consumption promotes loss of intestinal barrier function. However, mechanisms by which ethanol affects the tight junction (TJ), the cellular structure responsible for maintaining the  epithelial barrier, are not well understood. Three classes of transmembrane proteins comprise TJs: occludin, claudins, and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). It has recently been postulated that JAM-A (F11R), the most abundant JAM expressed in intestinal , regulates "leak" pathway flux, a paracellular route for the nonselective permeation of large solutes. Since transluminal flux of many -derived antigens occurs through this pathway, we investigated the role of JAM-A in ethanol-induced disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Using Caco- and SK-CO15 monolayers, we found that ethanol induced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in JAM-A protein expression to about 70% of baseline levels. Alcohol also reduced Ras-related protein  (Rap2) activity, and enhanced myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) activity, changes consistent with impaired JAM-A signaling. Stable overexpression and shRNA-mediated knockdown of JAM-A were employed to investigate the role of JAM-A in paracellular-mediated flux following alcohol exposure. The paracellular flux of 40-kDa fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC)-dextran following ethanol treatment was decreased by the overexpression of JAM-A; conversely, flux was enhanced by JAM-A knockdown. Thus, we conclude that ethanol-mediated control of JAM-A expression and function contributes to mechanisms by which this chemical induces intestinal epithelial leakiness.© 2017 The Authors.

Seven pairs of newborn twin lambs were used. Within each pair, lambs were assigned to receive an oral infusion of SB at 0.36 g/kg body weight (BW) (SB, n = 7) or the same volume of saline (Con, n = 7). Treatments were administered from 10 to 49 d of age, when all lambs were slaughtered. Results showed that the average daily feed intake (ADFI) of starter, average daily gain (ADG), BW of lambs at ages of 5 and 6 wk in SB group were greater (P < 0.05) than those in Con group. Infusion of SB increased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of acetate, butyrate, and total VFA in the rumen fluid and elevated (P < 0.05) the levels of β-hydroxybutyrate acid (BHBA), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and insulin in plasma. Infusion of SB promoted rumen papillae growth, depicted by higher emptied rumen weight, larger rumen papillae length, width, and surface area, and greater thickness of stratum corneum and total . Sodium butyrate infusion upregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of cyclin A2, cyclin D1, and cyclin-dependent kinases 6 (CDK6), and downregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of caspase-3 and Bcl--associated X protein (Bax) in the rumen epithelia. Moreover, SB infusion also upregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5), and downregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) in the rumen epithelia. Sodium butyrate infusion also enhanced (P < 0.05) gene expressions of monocarboxylate transporter isoform 1 (MCT1), downregulated in adenoma (DRA), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase isoform  (HMGCS2), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMGCL), while depressed (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of sodium/proton exchanger isoform  (NHE2) in the rumen epithelia. Our results suggest that the SB infusion can improve animal performance, promote the ruminal papillae growth, and enhance expression of genes related to ruminal epithelial VFA uptake and metabolism in preweaning twin lambs. These findings provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of SB promoting rumen epithelial development and function in preweaning lambs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679499>Molecular ontogeny of the stomach in the catshark Scyliorhinus canicula.</a></h2><p>The origin of extracellular digestion in metazoans was accompanied by structural and physiological alterations of the . These adaptations culminated in the differentiation of a novel digestive structure in jawed vertebrates, the stomach. Specific endoderm/mesenchyme signalling is required for stomach differentiation, involving the growth and transcription factors: 1) Shh and Bmp4, required for stomach outgrowth; ) Barx1, Sfrps and Sox2, required for gastric  development and 3) Cdx1 and Cdx2, involved in intestinal versus gastric identity. Thus, modulation of endoderm/mesenchyme signalling emerges as a plausible mechanism linked to the origin of the stomach. In order to gain insight into the ancient mechanisms capable of generating this structure in jawed vertebrates, we characterised the development of the  in the catshark Scyliorhinus canicula. As chondrichthyans, these animals retained plesiomorphic features of jawed vertebrates, including a well-differentiated stomach. We identified a clear molecular regionalization of their embryonic , characterised by the expression of barx1 and sox2 in the prospective stomach region and expression of cdx1 and cdx2 in the prospective intestine. Furthermore, we show that gastric gland development occurs close to hatching, accompanied by the onset of gastric proton pump activity. Our findings favour a scenario in which the developmental mechanisms involved in the origin of the stomach were present in the common ancestor of chondrichthyans and osteichthyans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30409105> bacteriocin is associated with intestinal and systemic improvements in diet-induced obese mice and maintains epithelial barrier integrity .</a></h2><p>We investigated the  bacteriocin plantaricin EF (PlnEF) system for its contributions to  mediated benefits in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. C57BL/6J mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) were administered a rifampicin resistant mutant of  NCMIB8826 (NICMB8826-R) or an isogenic Δ mutant strain, LM0419, every 48 h for nine weeks. Mice fed wild-type , but not LM0419, reduced their consumption of the HFD starting three weeks into the study and exhibited an overall 10% reduction in weight gain. The responses were independent of glucose homeostasis, as both NCMIB8826-R and LM0419 fed mice had improved oral glucose tolerance compared to sham controls. Although bacteriocins have antibacterial properties, the ileal, cecal, and fecal microbiota and cecocolic metabolomes were unchanged between mice fed either wild-type  or the Δ mutant. Instead, only mice fed NCMIB8826-R showed an increased production of ZO-1 in ileal tissues. To verify a potential role for the plantaricin EF system in supporting intestinal epithelial function, synthesized PlnEF peptides were applied to Caco- cell monolayers challenged with TNF-α and IFN-γ. The combination of PlnE and PlnF were required to prevent sustained cytokine-induced losses to Caco- cell para- and transcellular permeability and elevated IL-8 levels. In conclusion, this study shows that probiotic  ameliorates the effects of obesogenic diets through a mechanism that involves the plantaricin EF system and likely includes  induced fortification of the intestinal .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30105286>Toll-Like Receptor-Mediated Intestinal Inflammatory Imbalance in the Pathogenesis of Necrotizing Enterocolitis.</a></h2><p>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants and attacks the most fragile patients at a time when they appear to be the most stable. Despite significant advances in our overall care of the premature infant, NEC mortality remains stubbornly high. There is no specific treatment for NEC beyond broad-spectrum antibiotics and intestinal resection, and current efforts have focused on preventive strategies. Over the past decade, we have proposed a unifying hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of NEC in premature infants that suggests that NEC develops in response to an imbalance between exaggerated proinflammatory signaling in the mucosa of the premature  leading to mucosal injury, which is not countered effectively by endogenous repair processes, and in the setting of impaired mesenteric perfusion leads to intestinal ischemia and disease development. One of the most important pathways that mediates the balance between injury and repair in the premature intestine, and that plays a key role in NEC pathogenesis, is Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which recognizes lipopolysaccharide on gram-negative bacteria. This review focuses on the role that the TLR4-mediated imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signaling in the premature intestinal  leads to the development of NEC, and will explore how an understanding of the role of TLR4 in NEC pathogenesis has led to the identification of novel preventive or treatment approaches for this devastating disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31238731>Avian coronavirus infection induces mannose-binding lectin production in dendritic cell precursors of chicken lymphoid organs.</a></h2><p>The aim of this immunocytochemical study was to compare mannose-binding lectin (MBL) production induced by avian coronavirus in the spleen and caecal tonsil (CT). One-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were experimentally infected with six QX field isolates and the H120 vaccine strain. In the negative control birds, the spleen was MBL negative, while the CT showed scattered MBL-positive cells in close proximity and within the surface  and germinal centre (GC)-like cell clusters. MBL was detectable in the ellipsoid-associated cells (EACs) and cell clusters in the periarterial lymphoid sheath (PALS) by 7 days post infection (dpi). In both organs, the MBL-positive cells occupy antigen-exposed areas, indicating that GC formation depends on resident precursors of dendritic cells. The majority of MBL-positive EACs express the CD83 antigen, providing evidence that coronavirus infection facilitated the maturation of dendritic cell precursors. Surprisingly, co-localisation of MBL and CD83 was not detectable in the CT. In the spleen (associated with circulation), the EACs producing MBL and expressing CD83 are a common precursor of both follicular (FDC) and interdigitating dendritic cells (IDC). In the CT (-associated lymphoid tissue, GALT) the precursors of FDC and IDC are MBL-producing cells and CD83-positive cells, respectively. In the CT the two separate precursors of lymphoid dendritic cells provide some 'autonomy' for the GALT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30602573>Elafibranor interrupts adipose dysfunction-mediated  and liver injury in mice with alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p> Reversal of alcohol-induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α (PPARα) and PPARδ dysfunction has been reported to decrease the severity of alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH). Autophagy is essential for cell survival and tissue energy homeostasis. Emerging evidence indicates that alcohol-induced adipose tissue (AT) autophagy dysfunction contributes to injury in the intestine, liver, and AT of ASH.  The effects and mechanisms of dual PPARα/δ agonist elafibranor on autophagy stimulation were investigated using mice with ASH.  C57BL/6 mice on ethanol diet showed AT dysfunction, disrupted intestinal barrier, and ASH, which was accompanied by alcohol-mediated decrease in PPARα, PPARδ, and autophagy levels in intestine, liver, and AT. Chronic treatment with elafibranor attenuated AT apoptosis and inflammation by restoration of tissue PPARα, PPARδ, and autophagy levels. In ASH mice, alcohol-induced AT dysfunction along with increased fatty acid (FA) uptake and decreased free FA (FFA) release from AT was inhibited by elafibranor. The improvement of AT autophagy dysfunction by elafibranor alleviated inflammation and apoptosis-mediated intestinal epithelial disruption in ASH mice. Acute elafibranor incubation inhibited ethanol-induced ASH-mice-sera-enhanced autophagy dysfunction, apoptosis, barrier disruption, and intracellular steatosis in Caco- cells and primary hepatocytes (PHs).  Altogether, these findings demonstrated that the PPARα/δ agonist, elafibranor, decreased the severity of liver injury by restoration of alcohol-suppressed AT autophagy function and by decreasing the release of apoptotic markers, inflammatory cytokines, and FFA, thereby reducing intestinal  disruption and liver inflammation/apoptosis/steatosis in ASH mice. These data suggest that dual PPAR agonists can serve as potential therapeutic agents for the management of ASH.© 2019 The Author(s).

This study investigated the ileal epithelial microbiota and its relationship with host epithelial function in goats fed a HG diet (concentrate/hay, 90:10) and a control diet (concentrate/hay, 55:45), aiming to elucidate the mechanisms involved in ileal adaptation to subacute acidosis. The HG challenge increased the ileal volatile fatty acid concentration ( p = 0.030) and altered the ileal epithelial microbiota by increasing (FDR < 0.05) relative abundances of active carbohydrate and protein degraders Synergistetes, Prevotella, Fibrobacter, Clostridium, Treponema, and unclassified Ruminococcaceae by 20.1-, 6.3-, 16.8-, 8.5-, 19.9-, and 7.1-fold, respectively. However, the HG diet tended to reduce (FDR < 0.10) the relative abundance of Candidatus Arthromitus (38.8 ± 36.1 versus .1 ± 3.1). Microbial functional potentials inferred using PICRUSt indicated that the HG challenge elevated abundances of pathways associated with metabolism of amino acid, glycan, cofactors, and vitamins, whereras it decreased pathways associated with signal transduction, xenobiotic biodegradation, and metabolism. Additionally, in the ileal  of HG goats, transcriptome analysis identified the increment (FDR < 0.10) of candidate genes involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, and the proinflammatory cytokine pathway, while downregulating genes encoding antimicrobials and complements (FDR < 0.05). Collectively, the HG challenge shifted the structure and functional potentials of the ileal microbial community and affected the host responses in the ileum of goats toward increased metabolic activities of macro- and micronutrients, together with an increased risk of  inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140746>Modulation of Intestinal Epithelial Glycocalyx Development by Human Milk Oligosaccharides and Non-Digestible Carbohydrates.</a></h2><p>The epithelial glycocalyx development is of great importance for microbial colonization. Human milk oligosaccharides (hMOs) and non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs) may modulate glycocalyx development.The effects of hMOs and NDCs on human  epithelial cells (Caco2) are investigated by quantifying thickness and area coverage of adsorbed albumin, heparan sulfate (HS), and hyaluronic acid (HA) in the glycocalyx. Effects of hMOs ('-FL and 3-FL) and NDCs [inulins with degrees of polymerization (DP) (DP3-DP10, DP10-DP60, DP30-DP60) and pectins with degrees of methylation (DM) (DM7, DM55, DM69)] are tested using immunofluorescence staining at 1 and 5 days stimulation. HMOs show a significant enhancing effect on glycocalyx development but effects are structure-dependent. 3-FL induces a stronger albumin adsorption and increases HS and HA stronger than '-FL. The DP3-DP10, DP30-60 inulins also increase glycocalyx development in a structure-dependent manner as DP3-DP10 selectively increases HS, while DP30-DP60 specifically increases HA. Pectins have less effects, and only increase albumin adsorption.Here, it is shown that '-FL and 3-FL and inulins stimulate glycocalyx development in a structure-dependent fashion. This may contribute to formulation of effective hMO and NDC formulations in infant formulas to support microbial colonization and  barrier function.© 2019 The Authors.

Knowledge of the pathophysiology of organ failure in sepsis is crucial for optimizing the management and treatment of patients and for the development of potential new therapies. In clinical practice, six major organ systems - the cardiovascular (including the microcirculation), respiratory, renal, neurological, haematological and hepatic systems - can be assessed and monitored, whereas others, such as the , are less accessible. Over the past  decades, considerable amounts of new data have helped improve our understanding of sepsis pathophysiology, including the regulation of inflammatory pathways and the role played by immune suppression during sepsis. The effects of impaired cellular function, including mitochondrial dysfunction and altered cell death mechanisms, on the development of organ dysfunction are also being unravelled. Insights have been gained into interactions between key organs (such as the kidneys and the ) and organ-organ crosstalk during sepsis.

They act directly by inactivating microbes but also link innate to adaptive immunity. A variety of innate immune functions has been described for these peptides, including chemoattraction and cytokine release. In this study, we describe the effect on cell morphology and cell adhesion of human defensins. We find that Human Defensin 5, the major product of specialized  epithelial cells, causes changes in cell morphology. HD-5 induces cell adhesion, binds to fibronectin and facilitates binding of T cells to intestinal epithelial cells.

The goal was to determine the effect of Eimeria maxima infection on the expression of genes that encode peptide and amino acid transporters (AATs), and also to determine whether decreased feed intake contributes to the change in gene expression by including a pair-fed group of broilers. Three groups of male Ross broilers: 1) not infected, ) infected, and 3) not infected pair-fed groups were used. Chicks were infected with 1,000 oocysts of E. maxima at 21 d of age. Feed consumption was obtained daily, and at d 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 post-infection (PI), 6 birds were euthanized, and a portion of the jejunum was removed for qRT-PCR. Infected birds had significantly decreased feed consumption between d 6 to 9 PI. At d 7 PI infected birds had a 45% reduction in weight gain, and pair-fed birds had a 32% reduction in weight gain. The feed conversion ratio at d 7 PI of infected birds was . while that of pair-fed birds was 1.7, compared to 1.5 in uninfected birds.

Trafficking behavior such as the migration pathway and transit time within the gastrointestinal tract, however, remains to be elucidated. Rat thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDLs) were transferred to a congeneic host that had undergone mesenteric lymphadenectomy. The migration pathway was investigated using newly developed four-color immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Donor TDLs showed rapid transition in  tissues from which they emerged in mesenteric lymph around 4 h after intravenous injection. Immunohistochemistry showed that donor TDLs predominantly transmigrated across high endothelial venules (HEVs) at the interfollicular area of the Peyer's patches (PPs), then exited into the LYVE-1+ efferent lymphatics, that were close to the venules. The rapid recirculation depended largely on the local expression of unsulfated sialyl-Lewis X on these venules where putative dendritic cells (DCs) were associated underneath. Recruited naive T cells briefly made contact with resident DCs before exiting to the lymphatics in the steady state. In some transplant settings, however, the T cells retained contact with DCs and were sensitized and differentiated into activated T cells. In conclusion, we directly demonstrated that lymphocyte recirculation within the  is a very rapid process. The interfollicular area of PPs functions as a strategically central site for rapid immunosurveillance where HEVs, efferent lymphatics and resident DCs converge. PPs can, however, generate alloreactive T cells, leading to exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease or  allograft rejection.© The Author(s) 2018.

Principal coordinate analysis highlights that each herbal medicine drives the formation of unique microbial communities. The relative abundance of approximately one-third of the 299 species profiled was altered by all 3 medicines, whereas additional species displayed herb-specific alterations. Herb supplementation increased the abundance of many bacteria known to promote human health, including Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., and Bacteroides spp. Herb supplementation resulted in the reduced relative abundance of many species, including potential pathogens such as Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Herbal medicines induced blooms of butyrate- and propionate-producing species. U. rubra and triphala significantly increased the relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, whereas G. glabra induced the largest increase in propionate-producing species. To achieve greater insight into the mechanisms through which herbal medicines alter microbial communities, the authors assessed the shifts in abundance of glycosyl hydrolase families induced by each herbal medicine. Herb supplementation, particularly G. glabra, significantly increased the representation and potential expression of several glycosyl hydrolase families.These studies are novel in highlighting the significant prebiotic potential of medicinal herbs and suggest that the health benefits of these herbs are due, at least in part, to their ability to modulate the  microbiota in a manner predicted to improve colonic  function, reduce inflammation, and protect from opportunistic infection.

In the present study, 10 goats were randomly divided into  groups; 1 group was injected with dexamethasone (Dex; 0. mg/kg), and the other group was injected with saline as the control (Con) for 21 d. Expression levels of key genes and proteins in the liver and  mucosa were analyzed and compared to investigate the impact of chronic stress on BA metabolism and related functions in ruminants.

Total cholesterol in the liver decreased moderately in response to Dex. The protein expression of cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 and cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily A member 1,  enzymes that control BA synthesis in the liver, remained unchanged by Dex administration (P > 0.05). The expression of several genes in the cecal mucosa encoding epithelial tight junction proteins, including occludin (P < 0.05), tight junction protein 1 (P < 0.01), and claudin 1 (P < 0.05), increased significantly in response to Dex, and expression of defensin beta 1, which can strengthen the innate immune system, was also upregulated (P < 0.05). In addition, BAs increased the expression of the Solute Carrier family 9 member A  (P < 0.01) that encodes a sodium hydrogen exchanger. These results suggest that the Dex-induced disruption of BA homeostasis might be mediated through a liver-independent pathway in goats, and the Dex-induced accumulation of TBAs in the cecal digesta may improve volatile fatty acid transportation and mucosal defense.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In current study, we aim to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of commensal bacteria in injury and epithelial restitution after IIR.Commensal  bacteria were deleted by broad-spectrum antibiotics in mice. IIR was induced by clamping superior mesenteric artery. Intestinal injury, permeability, epithelial proliferation, and proinflammatory activity of mesenteric lymph were investigated.Commensals deletion improved mice survival in the early phase, but failed to improve the overall survival at 96 h after IIR. Commensals deletion reduced proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and augmented proinflammatory activity of mesenteric lymph after IIR. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) supplement promoted IEC proliferation and improved survival in mice with commensals deletion after IIR. LPS induced production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in mucosa via toll-like receptor 4-NFκB-cyclooxygenase  pathway. PGE2 enhanced IEC proliferation in vivo, which was preceded by activation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/. Blocking of EGFR, PI3K/Akt activity abolished LPS-induced IEC proliferation.Commensal bacteria are essential for epithelial restitution after IIR, which enhance IEC proliferation via induction of PGE2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31107965>Metabolism at the centre of the host-microbe relationship.</a></h2><p>Maintaining homoeostatic host-microbe interactions is vital for host immune function.

However, the way in which intestinal immune cells regulate the self-renewal of ISCs remains elusive. Here we found that mouse and human Lgr5 ISCs showed high expression of the immune cell-associated circular RNA circPan3 (originating from the Pan3 gene transcript). Deletion of circPan3 in Lgr5 ISCs impaired their self-renewal capacity and the regeneration of   in a manner dependent on immune cells. circPan3 bound mRNA encoding the cytokine IL-13 receptor subunit IL-13Rα1 (Il13ra1) in ISCs to increase its stability, which led to the expression of IL-13Rα1 in ISCs. IL-13 produced by group  innate lymphoid cells in the crypt niche engaged IL-13Rα1 on crypt ISCs and activated signaling mediated by IL-13‒IL-13R, which in turn initiated expression of the transcription factor Foxp1. Foxp1 is associated with β-catenin in rendering its nuclear translocation, which caused activation of the β-catenin pathway and the maintenance of Lgr5 ISCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30597072>Modulation of broiler  microbiota and gene expression of Toll-like receptors and tight junction proteins by diet type and inclusion of phytogenics.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the effect of reduced dietary energy (ME) and crude protein (CP) levels along with inclusion of a phytogenic feed additive (PFA) on  microbiota composition and gene expression of Toll-like receptor(s) (TLR), tight junction proteins, and inflammatory cytokines expressed in secondary lymphoid organs. Depending on dietary ME and CP level down regulation and the inclusion or not of PFA at 125 mg/kg diet, 450 one-day-old male broilers were allocated in the following 6 treatments for 42 D according to a 3 ×  factorial design: A: diet formulated optimally to meet broiler nutrient requirements; APh: A+PFA; B: suboptimal in ME and CP levels by 3%; BPh: B+PFA; C: suboptimal in ME and CP levels by 6%; CPh: C+PFA. Diet type and PFA supplementation were shown to affect mostly the mucosa-associated microbiota compared to the luminal ones. Ileal mucosa-associated total bacteria (PD= 0.005), Lactobacillus spp. (PD= 0.003), and Clostridium cluster XIVa (PD= 0.009) were affected by diet type with broilers fed diet B having lower levels compared to broilers fed diets A or C. Moreover, diet type affected cecal mucosa-associated Lactobacillus spp. (PD= 0.002) with broilers fed diet C having lower levels compared to broilers fed diets A or B. Supplementation with PFA resulted in higher levels of cecal mucosa-associated Bacteroides (PP= 0.031), Clostridium cluster IV (PP= 0.007), and Clostridium cluster XIVa (PP= 0.039). Diet type affected TLR2 (PD= 0.046) and claudin 5 (PD= 0.027) in cecal . Lower TLR2 (PP= 0.021) and higher zonula occludens  (PP= 0.031) relative gene expressions were seen in ileal  following PFA supplementation. Moreover, in cecal , PFA supplementation resulted in lower TLR2 (PP < 0.001) and higher zonula occludens  (PP= 0.009), claudin 5 (PP= 0.005) and occludin (PP= 0.039) relative gene expressions. There were no significant diet type and PFA effects on cytokines in secondary lymphoid organs, except for a dietary effect on transforming growth factor beta 4 (PD= 0.023) in cecal tonsils.

We further characterized these crypt changes (CC), their timing of occurrence, and tested their association with infection/inflammatory conditions.Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of 345 VA were evaluated for the presence or absence of CC and their different morphologies. Autopsy reports were reviewed for evidence of amniotic fluid or fetal systemic infection and placental inflammatory conditions.Crypt dilatation with or without irregularity of the lumen, crypt dilatation with semiattenuated , intraluminal apoptotic debris and inflammatory cells, especially eosinophils, and foci of swirled spindled cells with calcifications or multinucleated giant cells were observed, either alone or in combination, in at least 58.5% (202/345) of the VA. CC began to appear at 17 weeks, peaked at 20 to 25 weeks (with up to 82% of VA exhibiting CC during this time), and followed by a steady decline beyond 28 weeks gestation. χ test of independence showed no significant association ( P = .435; >0.05) between the presence and absence of CC and infection status of the fetus or placenta.The underrecognized CC of the developing fetal vermiform appendix (VA) showed distinct temporal pattern of occurrence and did not seem to be affected by the presence or absence of infection, which so far favored their being a part of the normal  developmental process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29800814>Piperine potentiates curcumin-mediated repression of mTORC1 signaling in human intestinal epithelial cells: implications for the inhibition of protein synthesis and TNFα signaling.</a></h2><p>Persistent activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is linked to sustained inflammation and progression of colorectal cancer. Widely available dietary phenolics, curcumin and piperine are purported to have antiinflammatory and anticarcinogenic activities through yet-to-be-delineated multitarget mechanisms. Piperine is also known to increase the bioavailability of dietary components, including curcumin. The objective of the study was to determine whether curcumin and piperine have individual and combined effects in the setting of  inflammation by regulating mTORC1 in human intestinal epithelial cells. Results show that curcumin repressed (a) mTORC1 activity (measured as changes in the phosphorylation state of p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 and 40S ribosomal protein S6) in a dose-dependent manner (.5-20 μM, P<.007) and (b) synthesis of nascent proteins. Piperine inhibited mTORC1 activity albeit at comparatively higher concentrations than curcumin. The combination of curcumin + piperine further repressed mTORC1 signaling (P<.02). Mechanistically, curcumin may repress mTORC1 by preventing TSC2 degradation, the conserved inhibitor of mTORC1. Results also show that a functional mTORC1 was required for the transcription of TNFα as Raptor knockdown abrogated TNFα gene expression. Curcumin, piperine and their combination inhibited TNFα gene expression at baseline but failed to do so under conditions of mTORC1 hyperactivation. TNF∝-induced cyclooxygenase- expression was repressed by curcumin or curcumin + piperine at baseline and high mTORC1 levels. We conclude that curcumin and piperine, either alone or in combination, have the potential to down-regulate mTORC1 signaling in the intestinal  with implications for tumorigenesis and inflammation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Prior to acute colitis onset, C57Bl/6 mice were prefed isocaloric 20% cooked navy bean (NB) or black bean (BB) diets for 3 weeks and switched to control basal diet (BD) 24 h prior to colitis induction via 5-day exposure to dextran sodium sulfate (% w/v in drinking water)+3 days of fresh water. The severity of the acute colitis phenotype was attenuated by bean prefeeding, evidenced by reduced colon tissue inflammatory transcription factor activation (NFκB, STAT3) and inflammatory mediator levels in the colon (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18 and MCP-1) and serum (TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, MCP-1) versus BD (P≤.05). Additionally, biomarkers of enhanced wound repair responses were increased by bean prefeeding including colon tissue protein levels of IL-22, IL-27 and activated (i.e., GTP-bound) Cdc42 and Rac1 versus BD (P≤.05). mRNA expressions of genes involved in normal colonic epithelial function and the promotion of epithelial barrier integrity, defense and/or restitution and wound closure including MUC1, RELMβ, IgA and REG3γ were all increased in NB and BB prefed mice versus BD (P≤.05). Collectively, bean supplementation prior to colitis induction (i.e., mimicking disease relapse) primes the colonic microenvironment to attenuate the severity of the colitis inflammatory phenotype and maintain aspects of epithelial barrier function.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We found that nanosilica impairs the intestinal uptake of oligopeptides. Downstream to absorption by the apical OPT-/PEP- transporter dipeptides were trapped in aberrant vesicles that grow over time and reach diameters of ≥6 μm. The peptide vesicles do not correspond to known organelles such as  granules and form independently of related gene products GLO-1 or GLO-3.

Chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) is widely used to produce a rodent model of stress-induced human mood disorders and depression. We previously showed that CSDS significantly affects the intestinal ecosystem including cecal and fecal microbiota, intestinal gene expression profiles and cecal metabolite profiles. Here, we investigated whether the glycosylation pattern in the intestinal  was affected in C57BL/6 mice exposed to CSDS (hereinafter referred to as CSDS mice). A lectin microarray analysis revealed that CSDS significantly reduced the reactivity of fucose-specific lectins (rAOL, TJA-II, rAAL, rGC2, AOL, AAL, rPAIIL and rRSIIL) with distal intestinal mucosa, but not with mucosa from proximal intestine and colon. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed the reduced TJA-II reactivity with intestinal epithelial cells in CSDS mice. In addition, distal intestine expression levels of the genes encoding fucosyltransferase 1 and  (Fut1 and Fut2) were downregulated in CSDS mice.

Patients suffering from IBD, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, present with skeletal complications. However, the mechanism underpinning IBD-associated bone loss remains vague. Intestinal inflammation generates an inflammatory milieu at the intestinal  that leads to dysregulation of mucosal immunity through -residing innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and other cell types. ILCs are recently identified mucosal cells considered as the gatekeeper of  immunity and their function is regulated by intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-secreted cytokines in response to the inflammatory microenvironment. We first demonstrate that serum as well as IECs collected from the intestine of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice contain high levels of inflammatory and osteoclastogenic cytokines. Mechanistically, heightened inflammatory response of IECs was associated with significant intrinsic activation of NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) in IECs and increased frequency of ILC1, ILC3, and myeloid osteoclast progenitors. Validating the central role of IEC-specific NF-κB activation in this phenomenon, conditional expression of constitutively active inhibitor kappa B kinase  (IKK2) in IECs in mice recapitulates the majority of the cellular, inflammatory, and osteolytic phenotypes observed in the chemically induced colitis. Furthermore, conditional deletion of IKK2 from IECs significantly attenuated inflammation and bone loss in DSS-induced colitis. Finally, using the DSS-induced colitis model, pharmacologic inhibition of IKK2 was effective in reducing frequency of ILC1 and ILC3 cells, attenuated circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, and halted colitis-associated bone loss.

Our aim was to investigate whether β-glucan could attenuate mast cell (MC)-induced hyperpermeability in follicle-associated  (FAE) and villus  (VE) of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and in noninflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-controls. Further, we studied mechanisms of β-glucan uptake and effects on MCs in vitro.Segments of FAE and VE from 8 CD patients and 9 controls were mounted in Ussing chambers. Effects of the MC-degranulator compound 48/80 (C48/80) and yeast-derived β-1,3/1,6 glucan on hyperpermeability were investigated. Translocation of β-glucan and colocalization with immune cells were studied by immunofluorescence. Caco--cl1- and FAE-cultures were used to investigate β-glucan-uptake using endocytosis inhibitors and HMC-1.1 to study effects on MCs.β-glucan significantly attenuated MC-induced paracellular hyperpermeability in CD and controls. Transcellular hyperpermeability was only significantly attenuated in VE. Baseline paracellular permeability was higher in FAE than VE in both groups, P<0.05, and exhibited a more pronounced effect by C48/80 and β-glucan P<0.05. No difference was observed between CD and controls. In vitro studies showed increased passage, P<0.05, of β-glucan through FAE-culture compared to Caco--cl1. Passage was mildly attenuated by the inhibitor methyl-β-cyclodextrin. HMC-1.1 experiments showed a trend to decreasing MC-degranulation and levels of TNF-α but not IL-6 by β-glucan. Immunofluorescence revealed more β-glucan-uptake and higher percentage of macrophages and dendritic cells close to β-glucan in VE of CD compared to controls.We demonstrated beneficial effects of β-glucan on intestinal barrier function and increased β-glucan-passage through FAE model.

Before activating the immune system, gluten peptides are transferred by the epithelial barrier to the mucosal lamina propria, where they are deamidated by intestinal tissue transglutaminase . As a result, they strongly bind to human leucocyte antigens (HLAs), especially HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, expressed on antigen-presenting cells. This induces an inflammatory response, which results in small bowel enteropathy. Although gluten is the main external trigger activating both innate and adaptive (specific) immunity, its presence in the intestinal lumen does not fully explain CD pathogenesis. It has been hypothesized that an early disruption of the  barrier in genetically susceptible individuals, which would result in an increased intestinal permeability, could precede the onset of gluten-induced immune events. The intestinal barrier is a complex functional structure, whose functioning is dependent on intestinal microbiota homeostasis, epithelial layer integrity, and the -associated lymphoid tissue with its intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). The aim of this paper was to review the current literature and summarize the role of the  microbiota, epithelial cells and their intercellular junctions, and IELs in CD development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741841>Thirty Years of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG: A Review.</a></h2><p>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) was the first strain belonging to the genus Lactobacillus to be patented in 1989 thanks to its ability to survive and to proliferate at gastric acid pH and in medium containing bile, and to adhere to enterocytes.

Islets and taste bud cells express the hormones glucagon and ghrelin, the same ATP-sensitive potassium channel responsible for depolarizing the insulin-secreting β cell during glucose-induced insulin secretion, as well as the propeptide-processing enzymes PC1/3 and PC2. Given the common expression of functionally specific proteins in taste buds and islets, it is surprising that no one has investigated whether insulin is synthesized in taste bud cells. Using immunofluorescence, we demonstrated the presence of insulin in mouse, rat, and human taste bud cells. By detecting the postprocessing insulin molecule C-peptide and green fluorescence protein (GFP) in taste cells of both insulin 1-GFP and insulin -GFP mice and the presence of the mouse insulin transcript by in situ hybridization, we further proved that insulin is synthesized in individual taste buds and not taken up from the parenchyma. In addition to our cytology data, we measured the level of insulin transcript by quantitative RT-PCR in the anterior and posterior lingual epithelia. These analyses showed that insulin is translated in the circumvallate and foliate papillae in the posterior, but only insulin transcript was detected in the anterior fungiform papillae of the rodent tongue.

Bisphenol A (BPA), an industrial compound used worldwide, has recently been classified as an environmental pollutant. One of our earlier studies has demonstrated that BPA disrupts the intestinal barrier function by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation in the human colonic epithelial cells line. In this study, we investigated the effects of dietary BPA uptake on the colonic barrier function in mice, as well as the intestinal permeability. Dietary BPA uptake was observed to destroy the morphology of the colonic epithelium and increase the pathology score. The levels of endotoxin, diamine peroxidase, D-lactate, and zonulin were found to have been significantly elevated in both plasma and colonic mucosa. A decline in the number of intestinal goblet cells and in mucin  gene expression was observed in the mice belonging to the BPA group. The results of immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1) in colonic epithelium of BPA mice decreased significantly, and their gene abundance was also inhibited. Moreover, dietary BPA uptake was also found to have significantly reduced colonic microbial diversity and altered microbial structural composition. The functional profiles of colonic bacterial community exhibited adverse effects of dietary BPA intake on the endocrine and digestive systems, as well as the transport and catabolism functions. Collectively, our study highlighted that dietary BPA increased the colonic permeability, and this effect was closely related to the disruption of intestinal chemistry and physical and biological barrier functions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the established role of incretin-based therapy to treat diabetes and metabolic disorders, we investigated a possible regulatory link between intestinal epithelial HNF4α and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), an incretin that is specifically produced by  enteroendocrine cells. Conditional deletion of HNF4α in the whole intestinal  was achieved by crossing Villin-Cre and Hnf4α C57BL/6 mouse models. GIP expression was measured by qPCR, immunofluorescence and ELISA. Gene transcription was assessed by luciferase and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Metabolic parameters were analyzed by indirect calorimetry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. HNF4α specific deletion in the intestine led to a reduction in GIP. HNF4α was able to positively control Gip transcriptional activity in collaboration with GATA-4 transcription factor. Glucose homeostasis and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion remained unchanged in HNF4α deficient mice. Changes in GIP production in these mice did not impact nutrition or energy metabolism under normal physiology but led to a reduction of bone area and mineral content, a well described physiological consequence of GIP deficiency. Our findings point to a novel regulatory role between intestinal HNF4α and GIP with possible functional impact on bone density.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30504792>Therapeutic potential of ectopic olfactory and taste receptors.</a></h2><p>Olfactory and taste receptors are expressed primarily in the nasal olfactory  and gustatory taste bud cells, where they transmit real-time sensory signals to the brain. However, they are also expressed in multiple extra-nasal and extra-oral tissues, being implicated in diverse biological processes including sperm chemotaxis, muscle regeneration, bronchoconstriction and bronchodilatation, inflammation, appetite regulation and energy metabolism. Elucidation of the physiological roles of these ectopic receptors is revealing potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications in conditions including wounds, hair loss, asthma, obesity and cancers. This Review outlines current understanding of the diverse functions of ectopic olfactory and taste receptors and assesses their potential to be therapeutically exploited.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691719>Microbiome in Mechanisms of Asthma.</a></h2><p>The lung and  microbiome are factors in asthma risk or protection. Relevant elements of the microbiome within both niches include the importance of the early life window for microbiome establishment, the diversity of bacteria, richness of bacteria, and effect of those bacteria on the local  and immune system. Mechanisms of protection include direct anti-inflammatory action or induction of non-type  inflammation by certain bacterial colonies. The  microbiome further impacts asthma risk through the contribution of metabolic products. This article reviews the mechanisms that connect the lung and  microbiota to asthma development and severity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The intestinal epithelial tissue derived from 19-day-old chicken embryo was cultured in Matrigel and the dynamic properties of the forming organoids were analyzed by time-lapse image analysis. It was observed that about one in ten organoids actively moved through the matrix, at a speed of 10-20 μm/h. Moreover, rotation was observed in the majority of organoids that did not migrate long distances. The fusion events took place between organoids, which collided during the movement or growth. In our previous paper, we showed that the presence of Toll-like receptor 4 ligand, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 μg/ml), increased the mean organoid diameter. Here, we confirm this result and demonstrate that the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μM) did not completely abolish organoid migration, but prevented the fusion events, in both LPS-treated and untreated cultures. In consequence, in the presence of Y-27632, the differences between cultures incubated with and without LPS were not visible. We conclude that migration and fusion of organoids may influence their morphology and suggest that these phenomena should be taken into account during the design of experimental settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29074485>Animal models of chemotherapy-induced mucositis: translational relevance and challenges.</a></h2><p>Chemotherapy for cancer patients induces damaging tissue reactions along the  of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This chemotherapy-induced mucositis (CIM) is a serious side effect of cytotoxic drugs, and several animal models of CIM have been developed, mainly in rodents and piglets, to help understand the progression of CIM and how to prevent it. Animal models allow highly controlled experimental conditions, detailed organ (e.g., GIT) insights, standardized, clinically relevant treatment regimens, and discovery of new biomarkers. Still, surprisingly few results from animal models have been translated into clinical CIM management and treatments. The results obtained from specific animal models can be difficult to translate to the diverse range of CIM manifestations in patients, which vary according to the antineoplastic drugs, dose, underlying (cancer) disease, and patient characteristics (e.g., age, genetics, and body constitution). Another factor that hinders the direct use of results from animals is inadequate collaboration between basic science and clinical science in relation to CIM. Here, we briefly describe CIM pathophysiology, particularly the basic knowledge that has been obtained from CIM animal models. These model studies have indicated potential new preventive and ameliorating interventions, including supplementation with natural bioactive diets (e.g., milk fractions, colostrum, and plant extracts), nutrients (e.g., polyunsaturated fatty acids, short-chain fatty acids, and glutamine), and growth factor peptides (e.g., transforming growth factor and glucagon-like peptide-), as well as manipulations of the  microbiota (e.g., prebiotics, probiotics, and antibiotics). Rodent CIM models allow well-controlled, in-depth studies of animals with or without tumors while pig models more easily make clinically relevant treatment regimens possible. In synergy, animal models of CIM provide the basic physiological understanding and the new ideas for treatment that are required to make competent decisions in clinical practice.</p></html>
