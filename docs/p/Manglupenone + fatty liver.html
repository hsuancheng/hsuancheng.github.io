A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by microbiota profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain  acids in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in weight gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain  acids. The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the  in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680281> Fat and Cardio-metabolic Risk Factors among School Age Children.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease is a major risk factor for cardio-metabolic disease in adults. The burden of  fat and associated cardio-metabolic risk factors in healthy children is unknown. In a population-based prospective cohort study among 3,170 10-year old children, we assessed whether both  fat accumulation across the full range and non-alcoholic  disease are associated with cardio-metabolic risk factors already in childhood.  fat fraction was measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging and non-alcoholic  disease was defined as  fat fraction ≥5.0%. We measured body mass index, blood pressure, and insulin, glucose, lipids and C-reactive protein concentrations. Cardio-metabolic clustering was defined as having three or more risk factors out of high visceral fat mass, high blood pressure, low high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol or high triglycerides, and high insulin concentrations. Non-alcoholic  disease prevalences were 1.0%, 9.1% and 25.0% among normal weight, overweight and obese children, respectively. Both higher  fat within the normal range (<5.0%  fat) and non-alcoholic  disease were associated with higher blood pressure, insulin resistance, total-cholesterol, triglycerides and C-reactive protein concentrations (p-values <0.05). As compared to children with <2.0%  fat, children with ≥5.0%  fat had the highest odds of cardio-metabolic clustering (Odds Ratio 24.43 (95% Confidence Interval 12.25, 48.60)). The associations remained similar after adjustment for body mass index and tended to be stronger in overweight and obese children. Conclusions: Higher  fat is, across the full range and independently of body mass index, associated with an adverse cardio-metabolic risk profile already in childhood. Future preventive strategies focused on improving cardio-metabolic outcomes in later life may need to target  fat development in childhood.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655133>β-Klotho gene variation is associated with  damage in children with NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic  disease in adults and children. Along with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile acid metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with  damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on  damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free  acids caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on  damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the .

We established a multidisciplinary metabolic hepatology clinic in 2014 and have analysed the clinical data to evaluate the effectiveness of this service. Patients with NAFLD (n=165) who had attended two or more appointments were included. Prespecified clinical data were collected prospectively at clinic appointments and analysed retrospectively. Interventions offered included lifestyle advice, signposting to weight loss services and pharmacological treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors. Median follow-up was 13 months (range: 2-34). 59% (n=97) of patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 53% (n=87) underwent  biopsy of whom 18% (n=16) had cirrhosis. Median alanine aminotransferase (ALT) reduced by 11 IU/L (p<0.0001), median weight reduced by 3.3 kg (p=0.0005). There were significant reductions in HbA1c, total cholesterol and  stiffness. Specifically, in patients with T2DM, HbA1c decreased by 4 mmol/mol (p=0.01) with significant reductions in ALT, weight and total cholesterol. Relative cardiovascular risk assessed by the QRISK3 score reduced in the whole cohort and in those with T2DM. Health economic modelling suggested the clinic intervention among those patients with poorly controlled T2DM was cost-effective. In conclusion, a multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with NAFLD in this observational cohort study was associated with improvements in -related and cardio-metabolic related health parameters and with evidence of cost-effectiveness in patients with poorly controlled T2DM.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Despite an increasing amount of people worldwide developing NAFLD and having it progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and potentially cirrhosis, there is still no approved therapy. Therefore, huge efforts are being made to find and develop a successful treatment. One of the special interests is understanding the -gut axis and especially the role of bile acids in the progression of NAFLD. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-agonists have been approved und used in other  diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and have shown signs of being able to decrease inflammation and potentially steatosis. This review will mainly focus on targets/ligands that play an important role in bile acid metabolism and give an overview of ongoing clinical as well as pre-clinical trials. With the complexity of the issue, we did not aim at giving a complete review, rather highlighting important targets and potential treatments that could be approved for NAFLD/NASH treatment within the next few years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691993>The impact of hepatitis B virus infection status on the prevalence of non-alcoholic  disease: A population-based study.</a></h2><p>We aimed to explore the impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on the prevalence of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) based on clinical big data.Data were collected from the health examination center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. Univariate and multivariate analysis were applied to investigate the relationship between HBV and NAFLD.A total of 14,452 patients were included, with an average age of 43.84 ± 13.03 years. Cases of HBV current-infection, past-infection, and non-infection were 2110 (14.6%), 9003 (62.3%), and 3339 (23.1%), respectively. The prevalence of NAFLD was significantly lower in the current-infection group (29.9%) than in the past-infection group (35.8%) and non-infection group (31.9%) (P <0.001). After adjusting for age, the prevalence of NAFLD in the current-infection group remained the lowest across all of the age groups. Multivariate analysis showed that current-infection was a lower risk of NAFLD (OR = 0.717, 95%CI: 0.608-0.846), whereas past-infection had no effect on NAFLD.Current HBV infection may lower the risk of NAFLD.

To date, the "multiple-hit" hypothesis is largely recognized as an explanation of NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. Obesity and features of the metabolic syndrome have been closely linked to NAFLD development. Due to the increased prevalence of obesity worldwide, NAFLD has reached epidemic proportions over time. Given its unfavorable cardiometabolic burden (such as cardiovascular and metabolic consequences), it represents a worrying phenomenon needing a more comprehensive and successful management. Laboratory tests and classical imaging techniques play a pivotal role in NAFLD diagnosis, but novel noninvasive alternative methods to diagnose and monitor NAFLD have been investigated. Currently, lifestyle modifications remain the mainstay treatment, although its efficacy is poor because of the lack of compliance. Pediatric research is focusing on multiple alternative treatments targeting the main pathogenic factors such as insulin-resistance, dyslipidemia, gut- axis and microbiota, oxidative stress, and proinflammatory pathways. Results from these studies are promising but larger validation is needed. Innovative therapeutic approaches might add an important piece in the complex knowledge of pediatric NAFLD. We aimed to summarize recent insights into NAFLD diagnosis and treatment in children, with a focus on possible future perspectives in pediatric research.© 2019 Di Sessa et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661889>Combined Exposure to Fructose and Bisphenol A Exacerbates Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in  of Developmental Male Rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether combined exposure to fructose and bisphenol A (BPA) has a synergistic effect on abnormal lipid metabolism in the  of developmental male rats and its possible mechanism. Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid metabolism include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1),  acid synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured.  tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in , and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid metabolism in the  of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690125>Expression of / subfamily members and oxylipin levels during LPS-induced inflammation and resolution in mice.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory stimuli, such as bacterial LPS, alter the expression of many cytochromes P450. CYP2C and CYP2J subfamily members actively metabolize  acids to bioactive eicosanoids, which exhibit potent anti-inflammatory effects. Herein, we examined mRNA levels of the 15 mouse  and 7 mouse  isoforms in , kidney, duodenum, and brain over a 96-h time course of LPS-induced inflammation and resolution. Plasma and  eicosanoid levels were also measured by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Expression changes in  and  isoforms were both isoform and tissue specific. Total   and  mRNA content was reduced by 80% 24 h after LPS but recovered to baseline levels by 96 h. Total  and  mRNA in kidney (-19%) and duodenum (-64%) were reduced 24 h after LPS but recovered above baseline by 72 h. Total  and  mRNA content in brain was elevated at all time points after LPS dosing. Plasma eicosanoids transiently increased 3-6 h after administration of LPS. In , esterified oxylipin levels decreased during acute inflammation and before recovering. The biphasic suppression and recovery of mouse  and  isoforms and associated changes in eicosanoid levels during LPS-induced inflammation and resolution may have important physiologic consequences.-Graves, J.

The aim of this study was to determine causes of cirrhosis in patients ≤40years old. In this multi-institutional retrospective study, pathology databases were searched for patients ≤40-year-old with a diagnosis of cirrhosis from 1995 to 2018. Clinical charts and pathology reports were reviewed to identify etiologies of cirrhosis in each case. The patients were divided into 4 age groups (<1, 1-<5, 5-<18, and 18-40years old) for further analysis. We identified 594 patients (264 female, 330 male). Among <18-year-old patients, congenital cholestatic diseases and developmental disorders were the most common causes of cirrhosis (50.2%, 172/342). Metabolic and genetic diseases were also seen more commonly in this age group (16.6%, 57/342). In contrast, viral hepatitides were the most common cause of cirrhosis in 18-40-year-old patients (39.6%, 100/252) followed by autoimmune and  disease (22.2%, 56/252 and 15.07%, 38/252, respectively). Cryptogenic cirrhosis (overall 7.2%, 42/594) was seen in 3% (4/133), 1.4% (1/69), 10.7% (15/140) and 8.7% (22/252) of patients aged <1, 1-<5, 5-<18, and 18-40years, respectively. Developmental and metabolic disorders are the most common causes of cirrhosis in children (<18), while viral hepatitides are leading causes in adolescents and young adults (18-40) similar to adults.

Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free  acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free  acids and  fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675427>Effect of Metabolic Traits on the Risk of Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Cancer in Non-alcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is now the most common  condition. Predicting its progression could help clinicians manage and potentially prevent complications. We evaluated the independent and joint effects of metabolic traits on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with NAFLD. We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with NAFLD diagnosed at 130 facilities in the Veterans Administration between 1/1/2004 and 12/31/2008 with follow-up through 12/31/2015. We performed competing risk, adjusted cause-specific Cox models to evaluate the effects of metabolic traits (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity) as additive or combined indicators on time to develop cirrhosis or HCC or a composite endpoint of both. Of the 271,906 patients, 22,794 developed cirrhosis, and 253 developed HCC during a mean of 9 years follow up. At baseline, the mean BMI was 31.6 (SD, 5.6), 28.7% had diabetes, 70.3% hypertension, and 62.3% had dyslipidemia with substantial overlap among the these traits. The risk of progression was the lowest in patients with only one or no metabolic trait. There was a stepwise increase in risk with each additional metabolic trait. Compared to patients with no metabolic trait, patients with both hypertension and dyslipidemia had 1.8-fold higher risk of progression to cirrhosis/HCC (hazard ratio (HR) =1.8, 95% CI=1.59-2.06); the risk was 2.6-fold higher in patients with diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension (HR=2.6, 95% CI=2.3,2.9). These associations were stronger for HCC. Diabetes had the strongest association with HCC in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Each additional metabolic trait increased the risk of cirrhosis and HCC in patients with NAFLD. Diabetes conferred the highest risk of progression to HCC.

However, the role of mainstream CS (MSCS) in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains unclear. During the first (early exposure) or last (late exposure) three weeks of methionine-choline deficient with high fat diet feeding (6 weeks), each diet group was exposed to MSCS (300 or 600 μg/L). Hepatic or serum biochemical analysis showed that MSCS differentially modulated hepatic injury in NASH milieu, depending on exposure time points. Consistently, NASH-related hepatocellular apoptosis and fibrosis were increased in the early exposure group, but decreased in the late exposure group, except for steatosis. Ex vivo experiments showed that CS extract differentially regulated inflammatory responses in co-cultured hepatocytes and macrophages isolated from steatohepatitic livers after 10 days or 3 weeks of diet feeding. Furthermore, CS differentially up- and down-regulated the expression levels of M1/M2 polarization markers and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) in livers (29% and 38%, respectively) or co-cultured macrophages (2 and 2.5 fold, respectively). Collectively, our findings indicate that opposite effects of MSCS on NASH progression are mediated by differential modulation of PPARγ and its-associated M1/M2 polarization in hepatic macrophages, depending on exposure time points.Copyright © 2019.

In this review, the beneficial effects of pterostilbene on diabetes,  steatosis and dyslipidemia are summarized. Pterostilbene is a useful bioactive compound in preventing type 1 diabetes, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in animal models. Concerning type 1 diabetes, the main mechanisms described to justify the positive effects of this phenolic compound are increased  glycogen content and hepatic glucokinase and phosphofructokinase activities, the recovery of pancreatic islet architecture, cytoprotection and a decrease in serum and pancreatic pro-inflammatory cytokines. As for type 2 diabetes, increased  glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase and decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activities are reported. When insulin resistance is induced by diets, a greater activation of insulin signaling cascade has been reported, increased cardiotrophin-1 levels and  glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities, and a decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activity. Data concerning pterostilbene and  steatosis are scarce so far, but the reduction in oxidative stress induced by pterostilbene may be involved since oxidative stress is related to the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis. Finally, pterostilbene effectivelly reduces total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels, while increases HDL-cholesterol in animal models of dyslipidemia.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698142>Dietary omega-3 PUFA improved tubular function after ischemia induced acute kidney injury in mice but did not attenuate impairment of renal function.</a></h2><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important complication after major surgery and solid organ transplantation.

Feeding of n3-PUFA did not attenuate renal function impairment, morphological renal damage and inflammation characterized by IL-6 and MCP-1 elevation or neutrophil infiltration. However, the tubular transport marker alpha-1 microglobulin (A1M) was significantly higher expressed in proximal tubular epithelial cells of STD + n3 compared to STD fed mice. This indicates a better integrity of proximal tubular epithelial cells and thus significant protection of tubular function. In addition, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) which protects tubular function was also up-regulated in the treatment group receiving n3-PUFA supplemented chow.We showed that n3-PUFA pre-treatment did not affect overall renal function or renal inflammation in a mouse model of moderate ischemia induced AKI, but tubular transport was improved. In conclusion, n3-PUFA food supplementation altered the oxylipin levels significantly but did not protect from renal function deterioration or attenuate ischemia induced renal inflammation.Copyright © 2019.

The random-effects model was used for data analysis, followed by subgroup analysis and meta-regression to explore sources of heterogeneity.Twenty-one articles were included in the study. Pooled analysis showed that H pylori infection indeed promoted NAFLD. Subgroup analysis and regression analysis showed that case-control ratio may be one of the sources of heterogeneity.H pylori infection is indeed one of the factors that promotes the progression of NAFLD for the Asian population.

However, little is known about serine metabolism in  disease (FLD). We aimed to investigate the changes in serine biosynthetic pathways in humans and animal models of  and their contribution to the development of FLD.High-fat diet (HFD)-induced steatosis and methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced steatohepatitis animal models were employed. Human serum samples were obtained from patients with FLD whose proton density fat fraction was estimated by magnetic resonance imaging. 3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh)-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and transgenic mice overexpressing Phgdh (Tg-phgdh) were used to evaluate the role of serine metabolism in the development of FLD.Expression of Phgdh was markedly reduced in the animal models. There were significant negative correlations of the serum serine with the  fat fraction, serum alanine transaminase, and triglyceride levels among patients with FLD. Increased lipid accumulation and reduced NAD and SIRT1 activity were observed in Phgdh-knockout MEF and primary hepatocytes incubated with free  acids; these effects were reversed by overexpression of Phgdh. Tg-Phgdh mice showed significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation compared with wild-type littermates fed a HFD, which was accompanied by increased SIRT1 activity and reduced expression of lipogenic genes and proteins.Human and experimental data suggest that reduced Phgdh expression and serine levels are closely associated with the development of FLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle  acid uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the , branched-chain α-keto acids decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino acids, thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino acids in tissues such as skeletal muscle and , and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino acids, as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino acids, alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino acids catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric acid, increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration, improving insulin resistance. This article reveals the mechanism of BCAA-induced insulin resistance and the relationship between exercise and BCAAs metabolism, adds a guarantee for the use of BCAAs, and provides a new explanation for the occurrence of diabetes and how exercise improves diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673045>Hepatic Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 deficiency-mediated activation of mTORC1- PGC-1α axis regulates ER stress during high-carbohydrate feeding.</a></h2><p>Stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a key enzyme in lipogenesis as it catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated  acids (MUFAs), mainly oleate (18:1n9) and palmitoleate (16:1n7) from saturated  acids (SFA), stearate (18:0) and palmitate (16:0), respectively. Studies on SCD1 deficiency in mouse models demonstrated beneficial metabolic phenotypes such as reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance. Even though, SCD1 represents a potential target to resolve obesity related metabolic diseases; SCD1 deficiency causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates unfolded protein response (UPR). The induction of ER stress in response to SCD1 deficiency is governed by the cofactor, PGC-1α. However, the mechanism by which SCD1 deficiency increases PGC-1α and subsequently induces ER stress still remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that despite reduced lipogenesis,  specific SCD1 deficiency activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) along with induction of PGC-1α and ER stress. Further, mTORC1 inhibition attenuates SCD1 deficiency-mediated induction of both PGC-1α and ER stress. Similar observations were seen by restoring endogenously synthesized oleate, but not palmitoleate, suggesting a clear mTORC1-mediated regulation of ER stress during SCD1 deficiency. Overall, our results suggest a model whereby maintaining adequate levels of hepatic oleate is required to suppress mTORC1-mediated ER stress. In addition, the activation of mTORC1 by SCD1 deficiency reveals an important function of  acids in regulating different cellular processes through mTORC1 signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659451>Anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 on high-fat and high-fructose diet mice base on inflammatory response alleviation and gut microbiota regulation.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047, and illustrate the potential functional mechanism about the alleviation of high fat and high fructose diet (HFFD) induced obesity and related metabolic abnormalities.C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a standard or HFFD with or without supplementation of L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 for 10 weeks. Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid,  function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in  and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain  acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658997>Inflammation triggers  X receptor-dependent lipogenesis.</a></h2><p>Immune cell function can be modulated by changes in lipid metabolism. Our studies indicate that cholesterol and  acid synthesis increases in macrophages between 12 and 18 hours after the activation of toll-like receptors with pro-inflammatory stimuli and that up-regulation of lipogenesis may contribute to the resolution of inflammation. The inflammation-dependent increase in lipogenesis requires induction of the  X receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, by type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals. Instead of the well-established role for  X receptors in stimulating cholesterol efflux, we demonstrate that  X receptors are necessary for the proper resumption of cholesterol synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Thus,  X receptors function as bidirectional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis driving efflux when cholesterol levels are high and facilitating synthesis in response to inflammatory signals.  X receptor activity is also required for the proper shutdown of a subset of type I interferon-stimulated genes as inflammation subsides, placing the receptors in a negative feedback loop that may contribute to resolution of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648561>KLF15-activating Twist2 ameliorated hepatic steatosis by inhibiting inflammation and improving mitochondrial dysfunction  NF-κB-FGF21 or SREBP1c-FGF21 pathway.</a></h2><p>Twist-related protein 2 (TWIST2) is identified as a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) transcription repressor by dimerizing with other b-HLH proteins. The significance of TWIST2 has been emphasized in various tumors; however, few studies report its functions in metabolism and metabolic diseases. Here we aimed to explore the novel role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in hepatic steatosis. Our results showed that  knockdown caused mice obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied with inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. , TWIST2 overexpression ameliorated hepatocellular steatosis, inhibited inflammation, and improved mitochondrial content and function with a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-dependent pattern. NF-κB negatively regulated FGF21 transcription by directly binding to  promoter DNA, which was eliminated by TWIST2 overexpression by inhibiting NF-κB expression and translocation to nucleus. TWIST2 overexpression decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, increased mitochondrial DNA and biogenesis, and enhanced ATP production and antioxidation ability. Additionally, TWIST2 expression was repressed by insulin-targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and forkhead box protein O1 and was enhanced by dexamethasone targeting Krüppel-like factor 15, which directly interacted with  promoter DNA.

Possible reasons for the NAFLD epidemic in industrialized countries are the high intake of pro-inflammatory n-6 polyunsaturated  acids (n-6 PUFAs) and low consumption of healthy n-3 PUFAs. Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, n-3 PUFAs may have the potential to alleviate chronic  disease. Herein, we examined the therapeutic effect of increased n-3 PUFA tissue levels in fat-1 transgenic mice on progressive NASH.Disease was induced in mice by streptozotocin and high fat diet (STZ/HFD) resulting in NASH. NAFLD in 6 and 8 weeks old wild type and fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice was analyzed. Unlike all other mammals, fat-1 transgenic mice ubiquitously express an n-3  acid desaturase, which converts n-6 to n-3 PUFAs, leading to increased n-3 and decreased n-6 PUFA tissue contents. damage, NAFLD activity score (NAS), hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation were significantly reduced in fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice in the early (6 weeks) but not late (8 weeks) phase of NASH. Simultaneously, mRNA expression of genes involved in  acid uptake and storage ( and , respectively) was significantly down-regulated in 6 week old but not 8 week old fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice.Endogenously elevated n-3 PUFA levels in fat-1 transgenic mice transiently delay the onset of STZ/HFD induced NASH but failed to efficiently protect from NASH development.2019 Hepatobiliary Surgery and Nutrition.

Adipose tissue is considered one of the largest endocrine organs in the body as well as an active tissue for cellular reactions and metabolic homeostasis rather than an inert tissue only for energy storage. The functional pleiotropism of adipose tissue relies on its ability to synthesize and release a large number of hormones, cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins, and growth and vasoactive factors, which are collectively called adipokines known to influence a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. In the obese state, excessive visceral fat accumulation causes adipose tissue dysfunctionality that strongly contributes to the onset of obesity-related comorbidities. The mechanisms underlying adipose tissue dysfunction include adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, increased inflammation, impaired extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis together with an altered secretion of adipokines.

In turn, dietary  acids can enhance resistance under cold stress. The present study reports the nutritional effect on suboptimal temperature tolerance based on histopathological alterations in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish (initial weight: 34.02 ± 0.79) were exposed to two different temperatures (20 °C and 30 °C) for 30 days. Under both conditions, fish were fed two different diets based on the linoleic/α-linolenic ratio (n6/n3 = 12.02 and n6/n3 = 3.85). The most important alterations in  caused by temperature included high cellular hyperplasia in fish at 30 °C (P < 0.05). Suboptimal temperature also caused gills aneurysm, lamellar lifting and low hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Cytoplasmic vacuolization decreased and nuclear displacement increased in the fish fed n6/n3 = 3.85 (P < 0.05). Suboptimal temperature provided high gills aneurysm, epithelial lamellae lifting and low lamellar hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Conversely, the  acid content (n6/n3 = 3.85) in the diet provided low lamellar lifting and fusions (P < 0.05). Finally, tilapia showed an increased glycogen storage trend in gills and muscle at low temperature (P < 0.05). Our study suggests that when feeding tilapia a high dietary n3 content, this fish is able to respond to suboptimal temperature in subtropical aquaculture facilities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their stratum corneum (SC) lipid composition differs from NHS causing a reduced skin barrier. The most pronounced differences in lipid composition are a reduction in lipid chain length and increased monounsaturated lipids. The -X-receptor (LXR) activates the monounsaturated lipid synthesis via stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1). Therefore, the aim was to improve the SC lipid synthesis of FTMs by LXR deactivation. This was achieved by supplementing culture medium with LXR antagonist GSK2033. LXR agonist T0901317 was added for comparison. Subsequently, epidermal morphogenesis, lipid composition, lipid organization and the barrier functionality of these FTMs were assessed. We demonstrate that LXR deactivation resulted in a lipid composition with increased overall chain lengths and reduced levels of monounsaturation, whereas LXR activation increased the amount of monounsaturated lipids and led to a reduction in the overall chain length. However, these changes did not affect the barrier functionality. In conclusion, LXR deactivation led to the development of FTMs with improved lipid properties, which mimic the lipid composition of NHS more closely. These novel findings may contribute to design interventions to normalize SC lipid composition of atopic dermatitis patients.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL, 2 mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and  triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of lipid metabolism related stearic acid and glycerol-2-phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic acid, fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic acid; and decreased levels of the amino acid metabolism products aspartic acid and serine.

Both dietary groups significantly improved their metabolic and hepatic markers after the intervention, with no significant differences between them. Multivariate regression models evidenced a relationship between weight loss, adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet), and a decrease in  fat content, predicting up to 40.9% of its variability after 6 months. Moreover, the antioxidant capacity of the diet was inversely associated with  fat content. Participants in the group with a higher adherence to the MedDiet showed a greater reduction in body weight, total fat mass, and hepatic fat.

Moreover, the metabolomicsanalysis showed that S. mussotii treatment could normalize the levels of many  acid metabolism related metabolites. And the results of pathway analysis showed that these metabolites significantly enriched in  acid biosynthesis pathway (myristic acid, dodecanoic acid and capric acid) and linoleic acid metabolism pathway (13-OxoODE).The results indicated that S. mussotii treatment could significantly improve the acute  injury through affecting the pathways related to lipid metabolism.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668088>Evaluation of sucrose-enriched diet consumption in the development of risk factors associated to type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic  disease in a murine model.</a></h2><p>Overconsumption of sucrose, the main contributor of the total added sugar intake in the world, has been associated with negative metabolic effects related to non-communicable diseases. However, this relationship continues to be a controversial topic and further studies are needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sucrose-enriched diet consumption in the development of risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic  disease in a murine model. Sucrose-enriched diet-fed rats showed a decrease in food, lipids and protein intake as well as in serum total cholesterol levels, an increase in carbohydrates intake, glucose, insulin, triglycerides, VLDL-c and HDL-c levels and a greater degree of insulin resistance, steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

SR-B1 and CD36 share an affinity for a wide array of ligands. Although they exhibit similar ligand binding specificity, SR-B1 and CD36 have some very specific lipid transport functions. Whereas SR-B1 primarily facilitates the selective delivery of cholesteryl esters (CEs) and cholesterol from HDL particles to the  and non-placental steroidogenic tissues, as well as participating in cholesterol efflux from cells, CD36 primarily mediates the uptake of long-chain  acids in high  acid-requiring organs such as the heart, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. However, CD36 also mediates cholesterol efflux and facilitates selective lipoprotein-CE delivery, although less efficiently than SR-B1. Interestingly, the ability or efficiency of SR-B1 to mediate  acid uptake has not been reported. In this paper, using overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown of SR-B1, we show that SR-B1 possesses the ability to facilitate  acid uptake. Moreover, this function is not blocked by BLT-1, a specific chemical inhibitor of HDL-CE uptake activity of SR-B1, nor by sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate, which inhibits  acid uptake by CD36. Attenuated  acid uptake was also observed in primary adipocytes isolated from SR-B1 knockout mice. In conclusion, facilitation of  acid uptake is an additional function that is mediated by SR-B1.Copyright © 2019.

Patient charts were evaluated for time to progression (TTP), complications and overall survival (OS). The group was split into NASH and non-NASH cohorts for comparison and additional analyses were done using propensity score matching (PSM).Patients in the NASH cohort presented with significantly larger lesions (4.9 ± 5.8 cm vs 3.1 ± 2.4 cm, p = 0.05). There was no significant difference in TTP overall [Median NASH 396 days (95% CI 308-526 days) vs non-NASH cohort 307 days (95% CI 272-364), p = 0.25) or after PSM [259 days non-NASH (95% CI 215-490) vs 396 days NASH (95% CI (349-not reached), p = 0.43]. There was a non-significant increased OS in the non-NASH [median 1078 days (95% CI 668-1594)] as compared to the NASH cohort [median 706 days (95% CI 314-not reached)] (p = 0.08) which decreased following PSM [853 days (95% CI 526-1511) non-NASH vs 706 days (95% CI 314-not reached) NASH, p = 0.48].

Furthermore, CYP26A1 a retinoic acid receptor-specific target was revealed as a new player mediating the suppressive effect of fish oil-supplemented diet on SCD1 and ELOVL6 hepatic gene expression.Plasma levels of MUFAs and SAFAs strongly reflect an altered hepatic  acid-metabolizing enzyme expression after supplementation with different dietary fats/oils.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686320>Regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in health and disease.</a></h2><p>Glucose and  acids are the major sources of energy for human body. Cholesterol, the most abundant sterol in mammals, is a key component of cell membranes although it does not generate ATP. The metabolisms of glucose,  acids and cholesterol are often intertwined and regulated. For example, glucose can be converted to  acids and cholesterol through de novo lipid biosynthesis pathways. Excessive lipids are secreted in lipoproteins or stored in lipid droplets. The metabolites of glucose and lipids are dynamically transported intercellularly and intracellularly, and then converted to other molecules in specific compartments.

In group 1, composed of patients with suspected hepatic steatosis (n=143), one abdominal radiologist performed gray-scale ultrasonography and two sessions of ATI. In group 2, composed of healthy volunteers (n=18), three independent sessions of ATI were performed by three abdominal radiologists. The visual degree of hepatic steatosis in all study subjects was graded on a 4-point scale by two independent reviewers using gray-scale ultrasonography. Thereafter, the attenuation coefficient (AC) was correlated with the degree of hepatic steatosis using Spearman rank correlation analysis. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the intra-observer (group 1) and inter-observer reproducibility (group 2) of ATI measurements.For the intra-observer reproducibility of ATI, the ICC was 0.929 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.901 to 0.949), and the coefficient of variation was 7.1%.

This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of body weight in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of  cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and  cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects lipid metabolism in the  and brain, but in the  it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis.

However, few reports have focused on the effects of different  acid (FA) compositions on the diversity of gut microbiota and its metabolites. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the effects of different dietary fats on  mRNA expression levels of genes related to cholesterol and bile acid (BA) metabolism, as well as to investigate cecal microbiota composition and bacterial metabolites composition in rats. Four-week-old male Wistar/ST rats were fed a 15% fat diet for 30 days, including from different sources (soybean oil, lard, menhaden oil, or tuna oil). Then, the rats' cecal microbiota composition was determined by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene using next-generation sequencing. Lard diet drastically decreased the expression level of  ATP-binding cassette subfamily G genes (Abcg5 and Abcg8 genes) compared with other diets. Menhaden oil diet increased the fecal BA excretion compared with soybean oil and lard diets. Fecal BA excretion tended to be positively correlated with the relative abundance of Firmicutes, and negatively correlated with the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes. These results have shown that dietary fats with different FA compositions have a different effect on the relative composition of cecal microbiota, and in particular, menhaden oil may have very different effects compared to other experimental fats. The effects of fish oils on the cecal microbiota may differ greatly depending on the ratio of EPA to DHA and the composition of FA other than n-3 polyunsaturated FA.

Urinary, biochemical, hemodynamic, and electrocardiographic parameters and renal function were assessed. Samples of the , heart, kidney, and arteries were collected to investigate redox status and perform histopathological analyses. All of the groups developed dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a ligand-activated transcription factor, plays an important role in lipogenesis. Increased Nogo-B expression can be determined in the  of cirrhosis patients. However, the effect of PPARγ activation on hepatic Nogo-B expression remains unknown. In this study, we found PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone or dephosphorylation increased Nogo-B expression at mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, we identified a PPARγ response element (PPRE) in Nogo-B promoter and found PPARγ enhanced Nogo-B transcription in a PPRE-dependent manner. ChIP assay further confirms rosiglitazone enhanced the binding of PPARγ to Nogo-B promoter. Using a  specific PPARγ deficient mice, we determined the critical role of PPARγ expression in regulating hepatic Nogo-B expression. Increased glucose and palmitate in culture medium activated Nogo-B and PPARγ expression in mouse primary hepatocytes, and corresponding, high-fat diet (HFD) induced  associated with increased hepatic Nogo-B and PPARγ expression in mice. Similarly, serum Nogo-B levels in patients with NAFLD were increased. However, rosiglitazone treatment reduced HFD-induced  and Nogo-B expression. In summary, our study identifies Nogo-B as a new molecular target of PPARγ, and suggests increased Nogo-B might be a potential indicator for NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The regeneration process consists of a complex network of cells and organs, including  cells (parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells) and extrahepatic organs (thyroid, adrenal glands, pancreas, duodenum, spleen, and autonomic nervous system). The regeneration process of a normal, healthy  depends mainly on hepatocyte proliferation, growth, and programmed cell death. Cell proliferation and growth are regulated in a cooperative manner by interleukin (IL)-6/janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)/phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt pathways. The IL-6/Jak/STAT3 pathway regulates hepatocyte proliferation and protects against cell death and oxidative stress. The PI3-K/PDK1/Akt pathway is primarily responsible for the regulation of cell size, sending mitotic signals in addition to pro-survival, antiapoptotic and antioxidative signals. Though programmed cell death may interfere with  regeneration in a pathological situation, it seems to play an important role during the termination phase, even in a normal, healthy  regeneration.

The prototypical ligand of the AHR is an environmental contaminant called 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD exposure is associated with many adverse health outcomes in humans including non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Previous studies suggest that AHR ligands alter cholesterol homeostasis in mice through repression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, such as Hmgcr, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis called 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). In this study, we sought to characterize the impact of HMGCR repression in TCDD-induced  injury. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to TCDD in the presence or absence of simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMGCR. Simvastatin exposure decreased TCDD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation in both sexes, but was most prominent in females. Simvastatin and TCDD (S + T) co-treatment increased hepatic AHR-battery gene expression and  injury in male, but not female, mice. In addition, the S + T co-treatment led to an increase in hepatic glycogen content that coincides with heavier  in female mice.

We used receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve to test the performance of models.Out of the 219 eligible patient records, 78 (35.6%) non-completion cases were identified. Significant differences between non-completers versus completers were: age (47.1 versus 54.5 years, p < 0.001); residential distance from the clinic (21.8 versus 17.1 km, p = 0.018); obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) (42.9% versus 56.7%, p = 0.050) and CPAP therapy (11.7% versus 28.4%, p = 0.005). The probability of non-completion could be independently associated with age, residential distance, and either OSA or CPAP. There was no statistically significant difference in performance between the alternate models (69.5% versus 66.4%, p = 0.57).Non-completion of intensive specialist obesity management services is most common among younger patients, with fewer complex care needs, and those living further away from the clinic. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risk factors for dropping out early when managing outpatients with severe obesity, whereas policy makers might consider strategies for increasing access to specialist obesity management services.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665641>Maternal Lipid Metabolism Directs Fetal  Programming following Nutrient Stress.</a></h2><p>The extreme metabolic demands of pregnancy require coordinated metabolic adaptations between mother and fetus to balance fetal growth and maternal health with nutrient availability. To determine maternal and fetal contributions to metabolic flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid metabolism were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal  transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid metabolism alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal  transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient metabolism in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Thus, the effect of a candidate substance, dansameum (DSE), using an in vitro and NAFLD mouse model (that is, apolipoprotein E-Knockout mice), were investigated. The molecular pathways for lipogenesis and inflammation were evaluated using Nile staining, Western blotting, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. It was shown that DSE significantly ameliorated the production of lipogenesis-related factors, including  X receptor-α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1,  acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, and CD36. In addition, DSE significantly reduced the production of inflammation factors, including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and nuclear factor kappa B. Furthermore, DSE significantly reduced the phosphorylation of c-Jun amino terminal kinase. Taken together, this suggests that DSE may be a functional food candidate for regulating NAFLD, based on its effects.© The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689373>The Gut- Axis in the Control of Energy Metabolism and Food Intake in Animals.</a></h2><p>Recent research has convincingly demonstrated a bidirectional communication axis between the gut and  that enables the gut microbiota to strongly affect animals' feeding behavior and energy metabolism. As such, the gut- axis enables the host to control and shape the gut microbiota and to protect the intestinal barrier. Gut microbiota-host communication is based on several gut-derived compounds, such as short-chain  acids, bile acids, methylamines, amino acid-derived metabolites, and microbial-associated molecular patterns, which act as communication signals, and multiple host receptors, which sense the signals, thereby stimulating signaling and metabolic pathways in all key tissues of energy metabolism and food intake regulation. Disturbance in the microbial ecosystem balance, or microbial dysbiosis, causes profound derangements in the regulation of appetite and satiety in the hypothalamic centers of the brain and in key metabolic pathways in peripheral tissues owing to intestinal barrier disruption and subsequent induction of hepatic and hypothalamic inflammation.

LT teams will be dealing with obesity in the coming years, and it is necessary for them to recognize some key aspects surrounding the LT in obese patients. Obesity by itself should not be considered a contraindication for LT, but it should make LT teams pay special attention to cardiovascular risk assessment, in order to properly select candidates for LT. Obese patients may be at increased risk of perioperative respiratory and infectious complications, and it is necessary to establish preventive strategies. Data on patient and graft survival after LT are controversial and scarce, especially for long-term outcomes, but morbid obesity may adversely affect these outcomes, particularly in NAFLD. The backbone of obesity treatment should be diet and exercise, whilst being careful not to precipitate or worsen frailty and sarcopenia. Bariatric surgery is an alternative for treatment of obesity, and the ideal timing regarding LT is still unknown. Sleeve gastrectomy is probably the procedure that has the best evidence in LT because it offers a good balance between safety and efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653319>The Importance of Amerindian Ancestry on Nonalcoholic  Disease in the Hispanic/Latino American Population.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649547>Mitophagy in Hepatic Insulin Resistance: Therapeutic Potential and Concerns.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome, characterized by central obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, increases the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic  disease, and other metabolic diseases. It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic  acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of  acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of  acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic  acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial  acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic  acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652359>Impacts of sex and exposure duration on gene expression in zebrafish following perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure.</a></h2><p>Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a member of the anthropogenic class of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs), and is one of the most frequently detected PFAS in water, humans, mammals, and fish around the world. The zebrafish (Danio rerio), is a small freshwater fish considered an appropriate vertebrate model for investigating the toxicity of compounds. Previous investigations showed tissue-specific bioaccumulation and alterations in the expression of  acid binding proteins (fabps) in male and female zebrafish, potentially due to interactions between PFAS and  acid transporters. In addition, a number of neurological impacts have been reported as a result of human and animal exposure to PFAS. Therefore, this comprehensive study was designed to investigate whether PFOS exposure affects the expression of genes associated with  acid metabolism (fabp1a, fabp2, and fabp10a) in zebrafish , intestine, heart, and ovary and genes involved in the nervous system (ChAT, ngf, bdnf, AChE, and hdac6) in brain and muscle. Results indicate alterations in expression of genes associated with  acid metabolism and neural function that vary with both exposure concentration and sex. Additionally, our findings highlight that the expression of these genes differ according to exposure duration. Our results extend the knowledge base on PFOS effects to other tissues less often studied than the .

Dietary iron intake was assessed using a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. The relationship between dietary iron intake and the prevalence of NAFLD was examined using logistic and spline regressions.A cross-sectional study including 5445 subjects was conducted. The prevalence of NAFLD was 36.9%. Compared with the lowest quintile, the energy-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of NAFLD were 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-1.64), 1.80 (95% CI: 1.41-2.29) and 2.11 (95% CI: 1.60-2.80) in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th quintile of iron intake, respectively (P-value for trend <.001). In addition, dietary iron intake was positively associated with the OR of NAFLD in a dose-response relationship manner (test for trend P < .001). However, after stratifying the data by gender, such association only remained in the male, but not in the female population. With adjustment of additional potential confounders, the results did not change materially.Subjects with higher dietary iron intake were subject to a higher prevalence of NAFLD in a dose-response relationship manner.

YQHX was prepared with substances with properties that benefit, to activate blood circulation based on the TCM theory.Animal models of myocardial infarction were established by ligating Sprague Dawley rats' left anterior descending coronary arteries. The animals were randomly divided into a myocardial infarction (MI) group, a YQHX group, a perindopril group, a r-secretase inhibitor, Notch signal inhibitor (DAPT) group, a DAPT+YQHX group and a sham group. The related drugs were administered on the second day after operation, and changes in the relevant indexes were examined on weeks 1 and 4. Changes in cardiac structure and function were examined by echocardiography. The  glucose and free  acids (FFA) were examined by ELISA. The expression of Notch, LKB1 and AMPK mRNA was examined by a real-time fluorescence quantitative method. The expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), and the expression of total acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and its phosphorylation were examined by western blotting.Compared with the sham group, the expression of Notch, LKB1 and AMPK mRNA in the MI group was lower. Compared with the MI group, the expression of these mRNAs in the YQHX and perindopril groups was higher, and their expression in the DAPT group was lower. At all time points, the protein expression of GLUT4 and pACC decreased in the MI group. On week 1, the expression of pACC protein was higher. In the DAPT group, the expression of pACC protein decreased. Compared with the YQHX group, the expression of pACC protein in the DAPT + YQHX group was lower. On week 4, compared with the MI group, the expression of GLUT4 protein in the YQHX group and the perindopril group was higher. The expression of GLUT4 protein in the DAPT group decreased. Compared with the YQHX group, the expression of GLUT4 protein in the DAPT+YQHX group was lower. There was no significant difference in the expression of ACC protein between the groups.YQHX promoted cross talk between the LKB1-dependent Notch1 and AMPK in myocardial tissue after myocardial infarction.

Hepatic steatosis was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound examination. Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the associations among various anthropometric parameters and IOP.After adjusting for pertinent covariables, hepatic steatosis had a closer association with increased IOP than percentage body fat, body mass index, or waist circumference (β = 0.017, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.006, 0.028). This relationship remained significant among males in the study population (β = 0.015, 95% CI = 0.001, 0.029). Furthermore, hepatic steatosis was significantly correlated with increased risk of high IOP (odd ratios = 1.235, 95% CI = 1.041-1.465).Our study highlights that hepatic steatosis is a better index for assessing the relationship with increased IOP than other anthropometric parameters.

NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced NASH. We previously used a preclinical mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse,  model to assess transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated  acids and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated  acids (PUFA) in membrane lipids and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as well as C ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins. NASH markers of inflammation and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted -value;  ≤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial remission of WD-induced NASH, at least in part, by lowering hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C ω3 PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696690>Application of transient elastography in nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common chronic  disease worldwide. Although it has become one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the Western world, the proportion of NAFLD patients developing these complications is rather small. Therefore, current guidelines recommend noninvasive tests for the initial assessment of NAFLD. Among the available non-invasive tests, transient elastography by FibroScan® (Echosens, Paris, France) is commonly used by hepatologists in Europe and Asia, and the machine has been introduced to the United States in 2013 with rapid adoption. Transient elastography measures  stiffness and the controlled attenuation parameter simultaneously and can serve as a one-stop examination for both  steatosis and fibrosis.  stiffness measurement also correlates with clinical outcomes and can be used to select patients for varices screening. Although obesity is a common reason for measurement failures, the development of the XL probe allows successful measurements in the majority of obese patients.

Stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a critical lipogenic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of two monounsaturated  acids (MUFA), oleate and palmitoleate, from the saturated  acids, stearate and palmitate, respectively. SCD1-deficient mouse models are protected against diet-induced adiposity, hepatic steatosis, and hyperglycemia. However, the mechanism of this protection by SCD1 deficiency is unclear. Using a -specific SCD1 knockout (LKO) mouse model fed a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet (HCD), we show that hepatic SCD1 deficiency increases systemic glucose uptake. Hepatic SCD1 deficiency enhanced glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) expression in the  and also up-regulated GLUT4 and adiponectin expression in the adipose tissue. The enhanced glucose uptake correlated with increased  expression and elevated plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a hepatokine known to increase systemic insulin sensitivity and to regulate whole-body lipid metabolism. Feeding LKO mice with triolein-supplemented, but not tristearin-supplemented, HCD reduced FGF21 expression and plasma levels. Consistently, SCD1 inhibition in primary hepatocytes induced FGF21 expression, which was repressed by treatment with oleate but not palmitoleate. Moreover, deletion of the transcriptional coactivator PPARg coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) reduced hepatic and plasma FGF21 and white adipocyte tissue-specific GLUT4 expression and raised plasma glucose levels in the LKO mice. These results suggest that hepatic oleate regulates glucose uptake in adipose tissue either directly or partially by modulating the hepatic PGC-1α-FGF21 axis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687367>The Triglyceride and Glucose Index Is a Predictor of Incident Nonalcoholic  Disease: A Population-Based Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>The triglyceride and glucose index (TyG), defined as the product of triglycerides (TG) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), is reported as a surrogate index for insulin resistance.

We investigated the relationship of circulating palmitoleate with insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in humans.Plasma NEFA concentration and composition were determined in non-diabetic individuals from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) study cohort at baseline (n = 1234) and after a 3 year follow-up (n = 924). Glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and beta cell function were assessed during an OGTT. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (M/I) and OGTT (oral glucose insulin sensitivity index [OGIS]). The  insulin resistance index was calculated using clinical and biochemical data. Body composition including fat mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance.Circulating palmitoleate was proportional to fat mass (r = 0.21, p < 0.0001) and total NEFA levels (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001). It correlated with whole-body insulin sensitivity (M/I: standardised regression coefficient [std. β] = 0.16, p < 0.0001),  insulin resistance (std. β = -0.14, p < 0.0001), beta cell function (potentiation: std. β = 0.08, p = 0.045) and glucose tolerance (2 h glucose: std. β = -0.24, p < 0.0001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, adiposity and other NEFA. High palmitoleate concentrations prevented the decrease in insulin sensitivity associated with excess palmitate (p = 0.0001). In a longitudinal analysis, a positive independent relationship was observed between changes in palmitoleate and insulin sensitivity over time (std. β = 0.07, p = 0.04).We demonstrated that plasma palmitoleate is an independent determinant of insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals. These results support the role of palmitoleate as a beneficial lipokine released by adipose tissue to prevent the negative effects of adiposity and excess NEFA on systemic glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652837>Deregulated Lysophosphatidic Acid Metabolism and Signaling in  Cancer.</a></h2><p> cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide due to late diagnosis and scarcity of treatment options. The major risk factor for  cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic  disorders and their progression to  cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to  cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of  cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation,  steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of  fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both  fibrosis progression and  cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652406>The pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid in rats with orotic acid-induced non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Post-transplantation non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is common in  transplant recipients. Changes in the expression levels and activities of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters have been reported in patients with NAFLD and relevant rodent models. Here, we evaluated whether the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunosuppressant, would be altered in rats with NAFLD. NAFLD was induced by feeding a diet containing 1% (w/w) orotic acid for 20 days. The extent of hepatic glucuronidation of MPA to a major metabolite, mycophenolic acid-7-O-glucuronide (MPAG), did not differ between rats with NAFLD and controls. The expression levels of hepatic multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, responsible for biliary excretion of MPAG, were comparable in rats with NAFLD and controls; the biliary excretion of MPAG was also similar in the two groups. Compared with control rats, rats with NAFLD did not exhibit significant changes in the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves of MPA or MPAG after intravenous (5 mg/kg) or oral (10 mg/kg) administration of MPA. However, delayed oral absorption of MPA was observed in rats with NAFLD compared with controls; the MPA and MPAG peak plasma concentrations fell significantly and the times to achieve them were prolonged following oral administration of MPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677889>Insulin resistance, but not insulin response, during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is associated to worse histological outcome in obese NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Obese subjects are at high risk of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and diabetes (T2D) due to insulin resistance (IR). Since high glucose levels are as toxic as lipids for hepatic metabolism, we hypothesize that altered response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is associated to more severe NAFLD with significant/advanced  damage.We studied 90 subjects with morbid obesity (73F/17M, BMI = 43.2 ± 5,9 kg/m) undergoing bariatric surgery and intraoperative  biopsy, and measured HbA1c, HOMA-IR (fasting Glucose x Insulin/22.5), OGTT glucose and insulin profile, and calculated OGIS (muscle insulin sensitivity), hepatic-IR (glucose [AUC] x insulin [AUC]) during OGTT, insulin response as (insulin [dAUC]/glucose [dAUC] or Insulinogenic Index (IGI = (I-I)/(G-G)). Patients were divided in 3 groups according to  biopsy: A (no-NAFLD, 23%), B (simple steatosis (SS), 53%) and C (NASH, 24%) with similar age, gender and BMI. Diabetes was 0% in no-NAFLD, 13% in SS, 35% in NASH. During OGTT, OGIS decreased from A to C (422 vs 360 vs 338, p < 0.01). Increased insulin concentrations, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and OGIS, not Hep-IR, were strongly associated to hepatic steatosis (p = 0.03, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01 respectively). Hepatic fibrosis stage was mild as most of the patients had fibrosis grade-1 (69% vs. 8% no fibrosis) and associated to fasting insulin, HbA1c and HOMA-IR. dAUC-I/dAUC-G was similar in the 3 groups, while only AUC-I was strongly associated to steatosis (r = 0.35, p = 0.005), but not to fibrosis.In morbid obesity indexes of IR, and not of insulin response, are markers of histological severity of  disease.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

IGFs take part in the embryonal development and postnatal growth, in interaction with the growth hormone (GH). The physiological effects of IGF1 are promotion of tissue growth and development, stimulation of cell proliferation, effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anabolic, anti-oxidant, neuro- and hepatoprotective properties. Our knowledge about the GH/IGF axis is diverse, partly contradictory, their research is continued intensively nowadays. We considered it worthwhile to review and interpret this information. Study on GH/IGF medical reports, with particular reference to the less known metabolic control. 75% of the growth factors are produced in the  by GH and insulin stimulation; their effects are expressed on specific receptors, and modified by specific binding proteins. IGF1 directly increases the muscle mass, bone density, and the structure of the bones. Intestinal microbiota induces secretion of IGF1, which promotes the development and remodeling of the bones. Short-chain  acids, produced in microbial fermented fibers, induce secretion of IGF1, suggesting that microbial activity also affects bone health  IGF1. IGF1 also has a direct and indirect glucose-lowering effect, enhances free  acid oxidation in the muscle, reducing the flow of free  acid into the , improving insulin signaling, resulting in the reduction of hepatic glucose output, and improves insulin sensitivity. IGF1 directly influences the expression of circadian BMAL1 in hypothalamic cells: this refers to the newly recognized 'zeitgeber' role of IGF1. The bioactivity of insulin-like peptides in the brain is characterized by neuronal survival, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, maintenance of normal free  acid levels, improvement of cognitive function, protection against cell damage, neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The effects of IGF2 are less outlined, however, it has a relevant role in the development of the fetus, and acts protectively on the brain. Lack or over-expression of IGF1 can be detected or may causally associated in many pathological conditions. According to these collected data, insulin sensitivity may be improved by different pathways. The role of IGFs in these processes should be a task of future research.

Emerging evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stressors is associated with abnormal foetal development. However, how prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust PM (DEP) predisposes adult offspring to the development of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. To examine this, C57BL/6J mice were exposed to DEP or a vehicle before conception and during pregnancy and fed normal chow or a high-fat diet. Then, the hepatic  accumulation in the adult male offspring and possible molecular mechanisms were assessed. Our data showed that prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow led to hepatic steatosis in adult male offspring with normal  function. However, prenatal DEP exposure relieved the hepatic steatosis and  function in offspring of mice fed a high-fat diet. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow increased lipogenesis and worsened  acid oxidation. The counteractive effect of prenatal DEP exposure on high-fat-diet-induced hepatic steatosis was produced through upregulated adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase, and this improved lipogenesis and  acid oxidation. Collectively, prenatal exposure to DEP programmed the development of NAFLD differently in the adult male offspring of mice fed normal chow and a high-fat diet, showing the pleotrophic effects of exposure to adverse environmental factors in early life.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether epigenetics and environmental factors interact to promote progressive NAFLD during IR. We examined the miRNA signature in insulin receptor haploinsufficient (InsR+/-) and wild-type (wt) HSCs by RNAseq ( = 4 per group). Then, we evaluated their impact in an IR-NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) model (InsR+/- mice fed standard or methionine choline deficient (MCD) diet,  = 10 per group) and in vitro.

However, the currently used supplements do not appreciably enrich brain DHA, although they enrich most other tissues. We tested the hypothesis that the ability of the dietary carrier to augment brain DHA depends upon the generation of DHA-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), the preferred carrier of DHA across the blood brain barrier. We compared the efficacy of DHA-triacylglycerol (TAG), di-DHA phosphatidylcholine (PC) and DHA-LPC to enrich brain DHA following their gavage to normal rats for 30 days, all at a dose of 10 mg DHA/day. The results show that DHA from TAG, which is released as free DHA or monoacylglycerol during digestion and is absorbed as TAG in chylomicrons, was incorporated preferentially into adipose tissue and heart but not into brain. In contrast, LPC-DHA increased brain DHA by up to 100% but had no effect on adipose tissue. Di-DHA PC, which generates both free DHA and LPC-DHA during the digestion, enriched DHA in brain, as well as in heart and . Brain-derived neurotrophic factor was increased by di-DHA PC and DHA-LPC, but not by TAG-DHA, showing that enrichment of brain DHA correlated with its functional effect.

Recently, energy metabolism in adipose tissue has been the subject of renewed interest, because significant energy expenditure can be induced in cells derived from white adipose tissue progenitors, in addition to brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here we evaluated whether aging-associated change in various adipose tissue depots affects the progression of NAFLD.Six-week-old male C57BL/6NCrSlc mice were fed control chow (C) or high-fat diet (60% fat; HF) for 12 or 24 weeks (12w/C, 12w/HF, 24w/C and 24w/HF groups, respectively) or switched from C to HF diet at 18 weeks of age (24w/C/HF group) and fed for a further 24 weeks. Some 24w/HF mice received a subcutaneous transplantation of adipose progenitors (10 cells/mouse) from young donor mice. Basal energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and  and adipose tissue histology were then evaluated. In addition, features of senescence and the capacity of adipose progenitors to "brown" were compared in mice of various ages.12w/HF mice demonstrated compensation in the forms of hypertrophy of interscapular classical BAT and the appearance of subcutaneous beige adipocytes, consistent with improved metabolic homeostasis. In contrast, 24w/HF and 24w/C/HF mice developed obesity, glucose intolerance, and severe NAFLD, with accelerated senescence and loss of adipose progenitors in subcutaneous fat tissues. Recruitment of adipose progenitors ameliorated these findings in 24w/HF mice.Impaired metabolic compensation in adipose tissue resulted in the progression of NAFLD, which was associated with aging-related deterioration in adipose progenitors.

The clock-driven cellular oscillations are highly tissue specific to efficiently fine-tune local signaling, manage energy use and segregate incompatible processes. In most peripheral tissues, food acts as the main cue that entrains the oscillations to external time. Food intake and energy balance are under control of endocannabinoid (EC) signaling. Despite this obvious link between the circadian and EC systems, evidence for their interaction started to emerge only recently. We used targeted lipidomics to analyze circadian variations in EC tone in rat plasma,  and adrenal tissue. The results provide the evidence that ECs, monoacylglycerols, N-acylethanolamines and their precursors oscillate with a tissue-specific circadian phase in plasma and . We then identified a set of rhythmically expressed genes likely responsible for the variations in EC tissue tone. In contrast to the , EC levels did not oscillate in the adrenal glands. Instead, we revealed that local EC receptor genes are under circadian regulation. To explore the impact of metabolic signals on expression of these genes, we used daytime-restricted feeding schedule. We subsequently showed that daytime feeding strongly suppressed -expressed  acid binding protein 5 (Fabp5) and adrenal-expressed non-canonical endocannabinoid receptors Gpr55 and Trpv1, whereas it upregulated -expressed Trpv1 and glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 1 (Gde1).

Patients with more severe obesity are more likely to have more advanced  disease, a finding that can assist in risk stratification, as well as monitoring and treatment approaches.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662868>Evaluation and comparison of six noninvasive tests for prediction of significant or advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>In nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD), advanced fibrosis has been identified as an important prognostic factor with increased -related mortality and treatment need. Due to the high prevalence of NAFLD, noninvasive risk stratification is needed to select patients for  biopsy and treatment.To compare the diagnostic accuracy of several widely available noninvasive tests for assessment of fibrosis among patients with NAFLD with or without nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).We enrolled consecutive patients with NAFLD admitted to two Austrian referral centers who underwent  biopsy.  stiffness measurement (LSM) was obtained by vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE, FibroScan) and blood samples were collected for determination of enhanced  fibrosis (ELF) test, FibroMeter, FibroMeter, NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4).Our study cohort contained 186 patients with histologically confirmed NAFLD. On  histology, NASH was present in 92 patients (50%), significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2) in 71 patients (38%), advanced fibrosis (F ≥ 3) in 49 patients (26%), and F ≥ 3 plus NASH in 35 patients (19%). For diagnosis of F ≥ 2, F ≥ 3, and F ≥ 3 plus NASH, respectively, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed superior diagnostic accuracy of ELF score (area under ROC curve (AUROC) 0.85, 0.90, 0.90), FibroMeter (AUROC 0.86, 0.88, 0.89), FibroMeter (AUROC 0.84, 0.88, 0.88), and LSM per protocol (AUROC 0.87, 0.95, 0.91) versus FIB-4 (AUROC 0.80, 0.82, 0.81) or NFS (AUROC 0.78, 0.80, 0.79).Proprietary fibrosis panels and VCTE show superior diagnostic accuracy for noninvasive diagnosis of fibrosis stage in NAFLD as compared to FIB-4 and NFS.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672448>Effects of newer antidiabetic drugs on nonalcoholic  and steatohepatitis: Think out of the box!</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic  disease in Western societies and a major cause of hepatic disease worldwide. Its more severe type, namely nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may result in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD, and especially NASH, are also associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) predisposes to NAFLD development and progression via insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. It has also been reported that the majority of T2DM patients have NAFLD/NASH, thus potentially further increasing their cardiometabolic risk. Current guidelines recommend to screen for NAFLD in all T2DM patients and vice-versa. Lifestyle remains the first-line therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH. Among antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was shown to improve histological features of NASH. More recently, there is an increasing interest regarding the effects of newer anti-diabetic drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on NAFLD/NASH. The present narrative review considers the up-to-date data on the impact of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs on biochemical and/or histological markers of NAFLD/NASH. The potential clinical implications of these findings in daily practice are also discussed. Taking into consideration the global increasing prevalence of NAFLD/NASH, therapeutic options that can prevent or treat this disease will exert considerable benefits on human health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The only hope for curative treatment or significant increase in life expectancy is early detection. Once patients have progressed towards end-stage HCC, effective treatment options are extremely limited on the background of a very high degree of heterogeneity in clinical presentation and outcome. Experimental chronic  injury and cancer have been used extensively to mimic the human disease. In particular, mouse studies have advanced the field due to the ability to easily manipulate the mouse genome and transcriptome for mechanistic evaluations. In addition, they offer the opportunity to screen new therapeutic strategies cost-effectively and in quick high-throughput, large-scale formats. The most commonly used mouse models in HCC research can be categorized as chemotoxic, diet-induced, and genetically engineered models. It is important to note that no particular model mimics all features of a given HCC etiology or histological subtype, and each model poses advantages and disadvantages that need to be carefully considered.Copyright: The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658496>Dietary Fish Oil Alters DNA Methylation of Genes Involved in Polyunsaturated  Acid Biosynthesis in Muscle and  of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar).</a></h2><p>Adequate dietary supply of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) is required to maintain health and growth of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). However, salmon can also convert α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) into eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) by sequential desaturation and elongation reactions, which can be modified by 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 intake. In mammals, dietary 20:5n-3 + 22:6n-3 intake can modify Fads2 expression (Δ6 desaturase) via altered DNA methylation of its promoter. Decreasing dietary fish oil (FO) has been shown to increase Δ5fad expression in salmon . However, it is not known whether this is associated with changes in the DNA methylation of genes involved in polyunsaturated  acid synthesis. To address this, we investigated whether changing the proportions of dietary FO and vegetable oil altered the DNA methylation of Δ6fad_b, Δ5fad, Elovl2, and Elovl5_b promoters in  and muscle from Atlantic salmon and whether any changes were associated with mRNA expression. Higher dietary FO content increased the proportions of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 and decreased Δ6fad_b mRNA expression in , but there was no effect on Δ5fad, Elovl2, and Elovl5_b expression. There were significant differences between  and skeletal muscle in the methylation of individual CpG loci in all four genes studied. Methylation of individual Δ6fad_b CpG loci was negatively related to its expression and to proportions of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in the . These findings suggest variations in dietary FO can induce gene-, CpG locus-, and tissue-related changes in DNA methylation in salmon.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679316>Trends in the prevalence of chronic  disease in the Korean adult population, 1998-2017.</a></h2><p>Data on the trends in the prevalence of chronic  disease (CLD) in Korea are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate whether the CLD prevalence changed between 1998-2001 and 2016-2017. Data were extracted from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1998-2001 to 2016-2017; n=25,893). Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) was defined as a hepatic steatosis index >36 in the absence of any other evidence of CLD. The definition of alcoholrelated  disease (ALD) was excessive alcohol consumption (≥210 g/week for men and ≥140 g/week for women) and an ALD/NAFLD index >0. The prevalence of NAFLD increased from 18.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.8-19.5%) in 1998-2001 to 21.5% (95% CI, 20.6-22.6%) in 2016-2017. During the same time period, increases were observed in the prevalence of obesity (27.0 vs. 35.1%), central obesity (29.4 vs. 36.0%), diabetes (7.5 vs. 10.6%), and excessive drinking (7.3 vs.10.5%). ALD prevalence also increased from 3.8% (95% CI, 3.4-4.2%) to 7.0% (95% CI, 6.4-7.6%). In contrast, chronic hepatitis B decreased from 5.1% (95% CI, 4.6-5.5%) to 3.4% (95% CI, 3.0-3.8%). The prevalence of chronic hepatitis C was approximately 0.3% in 2016-2017. The prevalence of NAFLD and ALD increase among Korean adults.

Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the  due to causes other than excessive alcohol use and is associated with  fibrosis. In this study, we asked whether miR-29a could reduce experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and  fibrosis in mice. We performed systematical expression analyses of miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates subjected to HFD-induced NAFLD. The results demonstrated that increased miR-29a not only alleviated HFD-induced body weight gain but also subcutaneous, visceral, and intestinal fat accumulation and hepatocellular steatosis in mice. Furthermore, hepatic tissue in the miR-29aTg mice displayed a weak fibrotic matrix concomitant with low fibrotic collagen1α1 expression within the affected tissues compared to the wild-type (WT) mice fed the HFD diet. Increased miR-29a signaling also resulted in the downregulation of expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition-executing transcription factor , mesenchymal markers , and such pro-inflammation markers as  and  within the  tissue. Meanwhile, miR-29aTg-HFD mice exhibited significantly lower levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), mitochondrial transcription factor A TFAM, and mitochondria DNA content in the  than the WT-HFD mice. An in vitro luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a mimic transfection reduced  acid translocase CD36 expression in HepG2 cells.

This study aimed to investigate BA profile alterations in Chinese nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients.BA profiles in serum and  tissues were determined by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in patients from two different clinical centers.A total of 134 participants were enrolled in this study to serve as the training (n = 87) and validation (n = 47) cohorts. The ratio of circulating conjugated chenodeoxycholic acids to muricholic acids (P = 0.001) was elevated from healthy controls to non-NASH individuals to NASH individuals in a stepwise manner in the training cohort and was positively associated with the histological severity of NASH: steatosis (R  = 0.12), lobular inflammation (R  = 0.12), ballooning (R  = 0.11), and fibrosis stage (R  = 0.18). The ratio was elevated in the validation cohort of NASH patients (P < 0.001), and it was able to predict NASH (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 75%) and significant fibrosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 71%) in these two cohorts. Moreover, this elevated ratio and impaired farnesoid X receptor signaling were found in the NASH .Altered BA profile in NASH is closely associated with the severity of  lesions, and it has the potential for predicting NASH development.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687382>Relationships between Metabolic Comorbidities and Occurrence, Severity, and Outcomes in Patients with Acute Pancreatitis: A Narrative Review.</a></h2><p>.

The enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the most important enzyme implicated in S-adenosylmethionine catabolism in the , is downregulated during NAFLD progression. We have studied the mechanism involved in GNMT downregulation by its repressor microRNA miR-873-5p and the metabolic pathways affected in NAFLD as well as the benefit of recovery GNMT expression.miR-873-5p and GNMT expression were evaluated in  biopsies of NAFLD/NASH patients. Different in vitro and in vivo NAFLD murine models were used to assess miR-873-5p/GNMT involvement in  progression through targeting of the miR-873-5p as NAFLD therapy.We describe a new function of GNMT as an essential regulator of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. In NAFLD, GNMT expression is controlled by miR-873-5p in the hepatocytes, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial functionality in a preclinical murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. Upregulation of miR-873-5p is shown in the  of NAFLD/NASH patients, correlating with hepatic GNMT depletion. Importantly, NASH therapies based on anti-miR-873-5p resolve lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis by enhancing  acid β-oxidation in the mitochondria. Therefore, miR-873-5p inhibitor emerges as a potential tool for NASH treatment.GNMT participates in the regulation of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial functionality through the regulation of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain. In NAFLD, GNMT is repressed by miR-873-5p and its targeting arises as a valuable therapeutic option for treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

The patients' addresses were mapped to census tracts, which were then linked to the community deprivation index (CDI; range 0 to 1, higher values indicating higher deprivation, calculated from six SES-related variables available publicly in US Census databases).Two cohorts were evaluated; one with MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and/or MRE (magnetic resonance elastography) findings indicative of NAFLD (n = 334), and another with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD (n = 245). In the MRI and histology cohorts, the majority were male (66%), non-Hispanic (77-78%), severely obese (79-80%) and publicly-insured (55-56%, respectively). The median CDI for both groups was 0.36 (range 0.15-0.85). In both cohorts, patients living above the median CDI were more likely to be younger at initial presentation, time of MRI, and time of  biopsy. MRI-measured fat fraction and  stiffness, as well as histologic characteristics were not different between the high and low deprivation groups.Children with NAFLD were found across the spectrum of deprivation.

Neoplastic cells are highly dependent on lipid metabolism as a source of energy and to support rapid cell division, and  acid derivatives play key roles in cell signaling. Aberrant expression of   acid–binding protein and changes in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated triacylglycerols have been shown to be associated with disease severity and subtype.

At baseline, glycated hemoglobin was 6.4 ± 1.0%, 61.5% of patients had fibrosis F2/F3 and the average NAS was 5.3. The primary endpoint was reached in 29.7%, 29.8%, 32.9% and 39.5% of patients in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg dose arms, respectively, with adjusted odds ratios relative to placebo of 0.89 (95% CI 0.44-1.81), 1.22 (95% CI 0.60-2.48), and 1.64 (95% CI 0.83-3.27). The 2 highest doses of MSDC-0602K led to significant reductions in glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin,  enzymes and NAS compared to placebo. The incidence of hypoglycemia and PPARγ-agonist-associated events such as edema and fractures were similar in the placebo and MSDC-0602K groups.MSDC-0602K did not demonstrate statistically significant effects on primary and secondary  histology endpoints. However, effects on non-invasive  cell injury and measures of glucose metabolism support further exploration of MSDC-0602K's safety and potential efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes and  injury. [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: ].First-generation insulin sensitizers are used to treat type 2 diabetes, but are associated with side effects including edema, bone fractures, and hypoglycemia. MSDC-0602K is a second-generation insulin sensitizer designed to reduce these side effects. We hypothesized that insulin sensitization could improve non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In the current study of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, MSDC-0602K did not demonstrate significant effects on  histology with the biopsy techniques used. However, useful information was gained for the design of future studies and MSDC-0602K significantly decreased fasting glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin, and markers of  injury without dose-limiting side effects.Copyright © 2019.

Gliptins, which were introduced for clinical use a decade ago, have been shown to be beneficial against nonalcoholic  disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in animals and humans. Cenicriviroc (CVC), a dual antagonist of C-C chemokine receptor type 2 and 5, is currently under investigation against NASH and fibrosis. It was previously discovered that evogliptin (EVO) reduces hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese animals but the effectiveness of EVO on NASH remains unexplored. Here, we compared the effectiveness of EVO and CVC against NASH and fibrosis in mice fed a high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFHF). Biochemical and histological analyses showed that mice fed a HFHF for 20 weeks developed severe hepatic steatosis and inflammation with mild fibrosis. Administration of EVO (0.2% wt/wt) for the last 8 weeks of HFHF feeding significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis as well as restored insulin sensitivity, as evidenced by lowered plasma insulin levels and the improvement in insulin tolerance test curves. Treatment of mice with CVC (0.1% wt/wt) inhibited hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis with similar efficacy to that of EVO, without affecting hepatic steatosis. CVC treatment also reduced plasma insulin concentrations, despite no improvement in insulin tolerance. In conclusion, EVO administration efficiently ameliorated the development of NASH and fibrosis in HFHF-fed mice, corroborating its therapeutic potential.Copyright © 2019 The Korean Physiological Society and The Korean Society of Pharmacology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675670>Ginsenoside Rg1 ameliorates palmitic acid-induced insulin resistance in HepG2 cells in association with modulating Akt and JNK activity.</a></h2><p>Hepatic insulin resistance can be induced by excess dietary intake of saturated fat. Ginsenoside Rg1 (GRg1), the major active ginsenoside enriched in tonic food ginseng, was reported to help alleviate  diseases. In the present study, GRg1 was evaluated for its impact on palmitic acid (PA)-induced hepatic insulin resistance model in vitro.Insulin resistance in HepG2 cells was induced by 0.5 mM PA exposure for 24 h and then the effect of GRg1 on cellular glucose consumption was measured. Expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6Pase) were analyzed by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Activation of protein kinases and transcript factor was analyzed by measuring protein phosphorylation. The influence of GRg1 on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HepG2 was also examined.GRg1 reversed PA-induced decrease in glucose consumption of HepG2 cells by downregulating gluconeogenesis genes G6pase and PEPCK. GRg1 increased Akt activation but inhibited JNK activation in PA-challenged HepG2 cells. Cellular ROS level was elevated in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells but was reduced by GRg1.Together these findings indicate that GRg1 protects against hepatic insulin resistance via preserving insulin signaling sensitivity and is a promising alternative medicine.Copyright © 2019.

Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation reduces fructose-induced non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to determine the role of FGF21 and underlying mechanisms in the protective effects of LGG.FGF21 knockout (KO) mice and C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice were fed 30% fructose for 12 weeks. LGG was administered to the mice in the last 4 weeks during fructose feeding. FGF21-adiponectin (ADPN)-mediated hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation were investigated.FGF21 expression was robustly increased after 5-weeks of feeding and significantly decreased after 12-weeks of feeding in fructose-induced NAFLD mice. LGG administration reversed the depressed FGF21 expression, increased adipose production of ADPN, and reduced hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation in the WT mice but not in the KO mice. Hepatic nuclear carbohydrate responsive-element binding protein (ChREBP) was increased by fructose and reduced by LGG, resulting in a reduction in the expression of lipogenic genes. The methylated form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) C, which dephosphorylates and activates ChREBP, was upregulated by fructose and normalized by LGG. Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1, which methylates PP2AC, was also increased by fructose and decreased by LGG. However, those beneficial effects of LGG were blunted in the KO mice. Hepatic dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, which inhibits PP2A, was markedly increased by LGG in the WT mice but attenuated in the KO mice. LGG decreased adipose hypertrophy and increased serum levels of ADPN, which regulates sphingosine metabolism. This beneficial effect was decreased in the KO mice.LGG administration increases hepatic FGF21 expression and serum ADPN concentration, resulting in a reduced ChREBP activation through dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated PP2A deactivation, and subsequently reversed fructose-induced NAFLD. Thus, our data suggest that FGF21 is required for the beneficial effects of LGG in reversal of fructose-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Combination antiretroviral therapy decrease mortality and morbidity in HIV patients, but lead to increase in insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, abnormalities of fat distribution and high risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, a metabolic clinic was established for individuals living with HIV in the Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. The clinic meets considerable demands by service users and hence has the potential to be popular. This review focuses on the importance of the development of a metabolic clinic for the purpose of audit, research, teaching and exchange of knowledge between HIV specialists and the metabolic team in the management of complex cases. Therefore, the metabolic clinic should be an integral part of HIV services especially as the cohort of the 'older' HIV population increases.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We analyzed data from 2239 hypertensive patients using descriptive statistics and supervised machine learning algorithms, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and random forest classifier, to select the most relevant features of NASH.  The prevalence of NASH among our hypertensive patients was 11.3%. In univariate analyses, it was associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Ferritin and serum insulin were the most relevant features in the final model, with a sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 79%, and area under the curve of 0.79.  Ferritin and insulin are significant predictors of NASH. Clinicians may use these to better assess cardiovascular risk and provide better management to hypertensive patients with NASH.

However, P-AKI still accounts for 3%-5% of cases of total AKI. Postabortion sepsis has decreased to between 0.9% and 1.5% in 2014 from 9.4% in 1980-1990 in the new millennium. Currently, in India, majority of P-AKI (70%-90%) occurs in the postpartum period and in late 3 trimester similar to the developed countries, but causes are different. We observed that preeclampsia/eclampsia is the most common cause of P-AKI in the late 3 trimester and postpartum period followed by puerperal sepsis and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Both puerperal sepsis and PPH are treatable and preventable etiologies of P-AKI. Timely and aggressive management of antepartum hemorrhage (APH/PPH) and puerperal sepsis are required to reduce the burden of P-AKI in developing countries. Specific-pregnancy disorders such as P-aHUS/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, pregnancy-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, and acute  of pregnancy are the uncommon/rare causes of P-AKI in India and possibly also because of the lack of awareness toward diagnosis. Despite decreasing incidence of P-AKI, fetal mortality remained high and unchanged. However, maternal mortality has decreased to 5% from initial high mortality of 20%-25%.

A baseline FLI ≥ 60 (the threshold for ) was found in 264 subjects (37.9%). The mean duration of fasting was 8.5 ± 4.0 days (range 6-38). FLI decreased significantly (-14.02 ± 11.67;  < 0.0001), with a larger effect in individuals with T2DM (-19.15 ± 11.0;  < 0.0001;  = 0.002 compared to non-diabetic subjects). Body mass index (BMI) decreased by -1.51 ± 0.82 kg/m, and 49.9% of the subjects lost ≥5% body weight. After fasting, nearly half of the 264 subjects with FLI ≥ 60 (highest risk category) shifted to a lower category. The improvement of FLI correlated with the number of fasting days (r = -0.20,  < 0.0001) and with the magnitude of BMI reduction (r = 0.14,  = 0.0001).

A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting -acid β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684925>The potential of antioxidant-rich Maoberry (Antidesma bunius) extract on fat metabolism in  tissues of rats fed a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>Obesity and dyslipidemia are major risk factors associated with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). NAFLD refers to the accumulation of fat in more than 5% of the  without alcohol consumption. NAFLD is the most common  disease and is rapidly becoming a global public health problem. Maoberry (Antidesma bunius) is a fruit rich in antioxidants, especially phenolic compounds, which are reported to have benefits for patients with NAFLD.We evaluated the effect of Maoberry extract on fat metabolism in  tissues of high fat diet-induced rats. Five (5) groups (n = 12) of male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into those given a high fat diet with no treatment (HF), different dosages of Maoberry extracts (0.38 [ML], 0.76 [MM) and 1.52 [MH] g/kg body weight) and 10 mg/kg statin (STAT). The rats were fed a high fat diet for 4 weeks to induce obesity and subsequently continued more for 12 weeks with treatments of Maoberry extracts or STAT. The levels of triglyceride,  enzymes, oxidative stress and inflammation markers, triglyceride synthesis regulators, and pathology of the  in high fat diet-induced rats were investigated.Feeding Maoberry extract in MH groups resulted in decreasing levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT),  triglyceride,  thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and mRNA expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT)-1 and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) compared with the HF group (P < 0.05). Moreover, histopathological study of the  showed reduced fat droplets in the Maoberry extract treatment groups, especially in MH groups and STAT treatment groups.The improvements of fat metabolism in  tissues of rats fed a high-fat diet were observed in Maoberry extracts treatment groups. The underline mechanism that link to fat metabolism might be through the process accompanied with down-regulated the gene expression of key enzymes of lipid production, antioxidant activity, and anti-inflammation properties of Maoberry extracts which contains high levels of phenolic and flavonoid compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651649>Hepatitis B virus infection and the risk of  disease progression in type 2 diabetic patients with potential nonalcoholic  disease: a retrospective, observational, cohort study in the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink.</a></h2><p>Assess the risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infection in patients with nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Retrospective cohort study in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink with three cohorts: subjects with T2DM and HBV infection (T2DM+HBV cohort; N = 297), with T2DM without HBV-infection (T2DM cohort; N = 261 865), and with HBV-infection without T2DM (HBV cohort; N = 3630). Primary analyses were performed on the three cohorts and secondary analyses on subcohorts including patients with NAFLD diagnosis code (N = 6599). Case/outcome definitions were formulated with International Classification of Diseases/Read codes/laboratory results and classified using validated algorithms. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated with a Poisson regression model.When comparing the T2DM+HBV and T2DM cohorts, adjusted IRRs were 14.06 (95% confidence interval: 4.47-44.19) for cirrhosis and 2.83 (1.06-7.55) for HCC. When comparing the T2DM+HBV and HBV cohorts, adjusted IRRs were 0.68 (0.21-2.27) for cirrhosis and 1.39 (0.46-4.20) for HCC.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which is common in obese individuals is associated with a greater incidence of NAFLD, which in turn, increases the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is unclear how obesity, OSA and NAFLD interrelate nor how they collectively contribute to an increased risk for developing HCC.Male BALB/c mice were exposed to diethylnitrosamine and phenobarbital followed by 48 weeks of either standard chow diet (chow), chow with hypoxia, high-fat diet, or a combination of hypoxia and high-fat diet. We noninvasively monitored tumor development using micro-CT imaging. We tracked the total weight gained throughout the study. We evaluated  histology, fat accumulation, carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) expression, as well as, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).A high-fat diet without hypoxia led to the development of obesity that induced hepatic steatosis and promoted tumorigenesis. Animals on a high-fat diet and that were also exposed to hypoxia had lower total weight gain, lower steatosis, lower serum AST and ALT levels, and fewer number of hepatic adenomas than a high-fat diet without hypoxia.These findings suggest that hypoxia abrogates obesity, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic tumorigenesis related to a high-fat diet.© 2019 Sweeney et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672443>Fibroblast growth factor 21 in non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of pathologies ranging from uncomplicated hepatic fat accumulation to a state of lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers or effective therapeutic options established for NAFLD. Nevertheless, there are several molecular targets in the pipeline, of which fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is one. FGF21 is secreted primarily from  and has a plethora of metabolic functions. Pre-clinical and epidemiological studies indicate a relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and hepatic fat content in both mice and humans. Moreover, animal studies have clearly shown that aberrant FGF21 signalling is a key pathological step in the development and progression of NAFLD. A recent Phase II clinical trial demonstrated that administration of an FGF21 analogue significantly reduced hepatic fat in subjects with NASH. As such, FGF21 provides a novel target for future biomarker and therapeutic studies. This review appraises preclinical data to outline the current understanding of FGF21 function in both normal hepatic function and NAFLD. Epidemiological evidence is explored to delineate the relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and NAFLD in humans.

This study was carried out on 50 female patients suffering from NAFLD with age ranging from 30 to 55 years; they were randomly divided into two equal groups: group A received (EA) stimulation at points of  3 (LR3),  14 (LR14), gall bladder 34 (GB34), and stomach 36 (ST36), whereas group B received AIT exercise. All patients in both groups A and B received 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks (receiving noninterrupted 18 sessions) in addition to their standard medications. Evaluation of all patients in both groups A and B was carried out before and after the treatment program by measuring the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), triglycerides (TGs), and C-reactive protein (CRP).  There is a significant decrease ( < 0.05) of ALT, AST, TGs, and CRP within each group, A and B, after 6 weeks of treatment sessions. A significant difference post-treatment was found between both groups in ALT, AST, and TGs ( < 0.05).

We investigated whether Protease-Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) plays a role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in NAFLD.Human  biopsies (n = 108) were quantified for PAR2 expression from NAFLD cases randomly selected and stratified by  fibrosis stage, the primary predictor for clinical outcomes, while controlling for age, gender, and BMI between fibrosis groups. Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of  biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high fat diet for 16 weeks and plasma and  assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total  cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile acid output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced  acid β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in  glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/2 as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in .These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic fat accumulation in NAFLD and related metabolic conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

High fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet-induced insulin resistance is implicated in multiple metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD), these metabolic diseases has become epidemic health issue worldwide. In this study, the effect of C. lanceolata polysaccharide (CLPS) on improving insulin sensitivity in chronic HFHS diet-fed mice was investigated. Our data indicates that CLPS significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting serum insulin (FINS) and insulin resistance index, in parallel with improved glucose and insulin tolerance impaired by HFHS diet. Impaired phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 were observed in the mice fed with HFHS diet, and those defects were also rescued by CLPS administration. In addition, CLPS caused a significant decrease in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and an increase in reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidised glutathione (GSSG) ratio; concurrent with enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and activated Nrf2 signaling. In summary, these findings suggest that CLPS ameliorates HFHS diet-induced insulin resistance through activating anti-oxidative signaling pathway, providing new insights into the protective effects of C. lanceolata polysaccharide in metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, we decided to investigate the relationship between antioxidant compounds intake and physical activity rate with NAFLD.In this study, 200 patients with NAFLD for the case group and 400 healthy subjects for the control group were selected. Patients were diagnosed as NAFLD after giving blood tests and performing Ultrasonography by a radiology specialist. Dietary intakes were evaluated through a validated 168-items semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Physical activity rate was estimated by a validated short form of International Physical Activity Questionnaire (Short IPAQ).The study population was between 20 and 60 years old and 46% of them were women. Weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, WHR, and BMI in the cases were higher than the controls. Physical activity comparisons showed that controls had higher physical activity rate than cases. Mean consumption of vitamins C, A, D and alpha-tocopherol in case group was less than the other group. After adjustment for all potential confounder, subjects who were in highest tertile of vitamin A intake -in comparison to those in the lowest tertile of intake-decreased risk of NAFLD (OR = 0.40, 95%CI: 0.30-0.55). The same finding was obtained for vitamin D; [Top category vs. bottom category of vitamin D of intake (OR = 0.35, 95%CI: 0.20-0.61)].We found that more intakes of vitamins A and D are related to lower risk of NAFLD in this group of Iranian adults. Physical activity rate in cases was less than the controls.

It has been closely linked to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, with strong implications for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This review focuses on the relationship between NAFLD and CVD and the proposed interactions interlinking these two diseases. This appraisal also discusses treatments targeting NAFLD in the context of CVD. NAFLD is a multisystem disease and ultimately the goals of therapy are to ameliorate CVD and prevent coronary artery disease morbidity and mortality.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is considered the most common chronic  disease. Our goal was to assess whether there is any association between Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) and NAFLD.We conducted a retrospective study of patients admitted with CDAD at Baruch Padeh Medical Center, Poria, Israel. Data on demographic characteristics, clinical signs, underlying conditions, presence of  based on CT/US imaging, and several risk factors for CDI were collected. The control group included patients with diarrhea who were negative for CDT and had been hospitalized during the same period. The controls were matched for age (± 5 years) , and gender.115/164 patients with CDAD met the inclusion criteria.The control group was consisted of 115 hospitalized patients with non-CDAD. The mean age of all the participants (230) was 69.57± 18 years. NAFLD was found in 76/115 (66%) patients with CDAD vs. 35/115 (30.4%) in the control group, P<0.001. Moreover, we found significant associations between CDAD group and metabolic syndrome, prior use of antibiotic in the last 3 months, NAFLD and high serum levels of C-reactive protein. Multivariate analysis showed that NAFLD, odds ratio (OR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-1.95, P=0.05 was significantly associated with CDAD.This retrospective study showed that NAFLD is associated with the risk of CDAD. Moreover, metabolic syndrome and high serum levels of CRP were significantly associated with the risk of CDAD.© The Author(s) 2019.

Factors contributing to this predisposition include oxidized polyunsaturated  acids, also known as oxylipids, whose production is altered during the periparturient period and in diseased cattle. Alterations in the production of oxylipids derived from cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes are over-represented during times of increased disease risk and clinical disease, such as mastitis. Many of these same CYP450 enzymes additionally regulate metabolism of fat-soluble vitamins, such as A, D, and E. These vitamins are essential to maintaining immune health, yet circulating concentrations are diminished near calving. Despite this, a relatively small amount of research has focused on the roles of CYP450 enzymes outside of the . The aim of this paper is to describe the relative gene expression of 11 CYP450 in bovine tissues and common in vitro bovine cell models. Eight tissue samples were collected from 3 healthy dairy cows after euthanasia. In vitro samples included primary bovine aortic and mammary endothelial cells and immortalized bovine kidney and mammary epithelial cells. Quantitative real-time-PCR was carried out to assess basal transcript expression of CYP450 enzymes. Surprisingly, CYP450 mRNA was widely expressed in all tissue samples, with predominance in the . In vitro CYP450 expression was less robust, with several cell types lacking expression of specific CYP450 enzymes altogether. Overall, cell culture models did not reflect expression of tissue CYP450. However, when CYP450 were organized by activity, certain cell types consistently expressed specific functional groups. These data reveal the widespread expression of CYP450 in individual organs of healthy dairy cows. Widespread expression helps to explain previous evidence of significant changes in CYP450-mediated oxylipid production and fat-soluble vitamin metabolism in organ microenvironments during periods of oxidative stress or disease. As such, these data provide a foundation for targeted functional experiments aimed at understanding the activities of specific CYP450 and associated therapeutic potential during times of increased disease risk.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

SGLT2 inhibitors are an insulin-independent class of oral antihyperglycemic medication that clinicians use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Multiple landmark clinical trials support the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing blood glucose levels, but it is important to understand when to properly utilize them. SGLT2 inhibitors are the most beneficial as an adjunct medication in addition to metformin in patients with a history of cardiovascular or renal disease who need further hemoglobin A1c reduction. The novel mechanism of action also demands clinicians be aware of the side effects not typically experienced with other oral antihyperglycemic drugs, such as genital tract infections, lower leg amputations, electrolyte disturbances and bone fractures. On top of their benefits in type 2 diabetes, novel uses for SGLT2 inhibitors are being uncovered. Diabetic patients with non-alcoholic  disease, who are at an increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, experience a clinically significant reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase levels. SGLT2 inhibitors are also effective at lowering body weight in obese individuals and decreasing systolic blood pressure. Dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitors are currently being investigated as possibly the first oral medication for type 1 diabetes.© 2019 Simes and MacGregor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682638>Nonalcoholic  disease is an early predictor of metabolic diseases in a metabolically healthy population.</a></h2><p>The relationship between nonalcoholic  disease and incident metabolic syndrome in metabolically healthy subjects is unknown. We aimed to investigate whether nonalcoholic  disease is a predictor of future metabolic syndrome in metabolically healthy subjects.Subjects who underwent health evaluation at least twice between 2009 and 2015 from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort in South Korea were included. Patients without obesity who had no metabolic syndrome components were finally analyzed (n = 28,880). The definition of nonalcoholic  disease was based on both the hepatic steatosis and  indices. The incidence of metabolic syndrome, prediabetes/type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was compared between the subjects with and without nonalcoholic  disease.The presence of nonalcoholic  disease was associated with a higher risk of incident metabolic syndrome, prediabetes/type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in the entire cohort (metabolic syndrome: adjusted hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-3.71; prediabetes/type 2 diabetes: adjusted hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.90; hypertension: adjusted hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-4.12; dyslipidemia: adjusted hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.06).

The inhibition of lipid accumulation is regarded as a potential treatment for NAFLD. In this study, we investigated the effects of γ-mangostin or α-mangostin on lipid accumulation in a cell model. Analysis of the inhibitory effects of γ-mangostin on lipid accumulation revealed that it downregulated NAFLD-related biochemical parameters and stimulated the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK pathway. Consequently, it suppressed lipid synthesis and enhanced  acid oxidation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the blockage of AMPK by the pharmacological inhibitor Compound C abrogated the promoting effect of AMPK. Similar results were also observed for α-mangostin. The effects of α-mangostin on lipid accumulation were inferior to those of γ-mangostin. The differences in CPT1A activity might be originated from their different chemical structures. Our results suggested that γ-mangostin and α-mangostin can be exploited as a potential candidate for NAFLD treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685037>Whole Grain Consumption and Its Effects on Hepatic Steatosis and  Enzymes in Patients with Nonalcoholic  Disease: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a considerable challenge to public health across the globe. Whole grain is highly recommended as an inseparable part of a healthy diet and has been proposed as an effective way to manage NAFLD. The objective in this study was to evaluate the effects of whole grain consumption on hepatic steatosis and  enzymes as primary outcomes in patients with NAFLD. Over the 12 weeks of this open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial, 112 patients [mean age: 43± 8.7 y; body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2): 32.2 ± 4.3] were randomly assigned to two groups to receive dietary advice; either to obtain at least half of their cereal servings each day from whole-grain foods or from usual cereals. By the end of the study, the grades of NAFLD showed a significant decrease in the intervention group (P < 0.001). In addition, a significant reduction in serum concentration of alanine aminotransferase (P < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (P < 0.001), γ-glutamyltransferase (P = 0.009), systolic blood pressure (P = 0.004) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.008) were observed in the intervention group compared to the control group.

First, mice aged five weeks were divided into two groups (vehicle group and canagliflozin group) and were treated for three weeks. Then, mice aged five weeks were divided into three groups of nine animals each: the vehicle group, early canagliflozin group (treated from five to nine weeks), and continuous canagliflozin group (treated from five to 16 weeks). Canagliflozin was administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg in these experiments. In addition, the in vitro effects of canagliflozin were investigated using HepG2 cells, a human HCC cell line. At the age of eight or 16 weeks, the histological non-alcoholic  disease activity score was lower in the canagliflozin-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice. There were significantly fewer hepatic tumors in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. Immunohistochemistry showed significantly fewer glutamine synthetase-positive nodules in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. Expression of α-fetoprotein mRNA, a marker of HCC, was downregulated in the continuous canagliflozin group when compared with the vehicle group. At 16 weeks, there was diffuse SGLT1 expression in the hepatic lobules and strong expression by hepatocytes in the vehicle group, while SGLT2 expression was stronger in  tumors than in the lobules. In the in vitro study, canagliflozin (10 μM) suppressed the proliferation of HepG2 cells. Flow cytometry showed that canagliflozin reduced the percentage of HepG2 cells in the G2/M phase due to arrest in the G1 phase along with decreased expression of cyclin D and Cdk4 proteins, while it increased the percentage of cells in the G0/1 phase. Canagliflozin also induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells via activation of caspase 3. In this mouse model of diabetes and NASH/HCC, canagliflozin showed anti-steatotic and anti-inflammatory effects that attenuated the development of NASH and prevented the progression of NASH to HCC, partly due to the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis as well as the reduction of tumor growth through the direct inhibition of SGLT2 in tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683679>Lipidomic Analysis of the Protective Effects of Shenling Baizhu San on Non-Alcoholic  Disease in Rats.</a></h2><p>Shenling Baizhu San (SLBZS), a famous traditional Chinese medicine, has been demonstrated to exert protective effects against non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), but its exact mechanisms have not been well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of SLBZS in a rat model of NAFLD using lipidomics and to evaluate the role of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the mechanism of SLBZS against NAFLD. The rat model of NAFLD was induced by high-fat feeding. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS)-based untargeted lipidomics approach was applied to analyze hepatic lipid alterations, and the SIRT1-selective inhibitor EX 527 was used to inhibit SIRT expression in the . The results of body and biochemical parameters, as well as histological changes, indicated that SLBZS administration exerted protective effects against NAFLD. Lipidomic analysis showed that 30 lipid species were effectively regulated by SLBZS administration in rats fed a high-fat diet. Pathway analysis indicated that glycerophospholipid metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism were potential target pathways closely involved in the mechanism of SLBZS against NAFLD. Moreover, the beneficial effects of SLBZS on hepatic steatosis, some biochemical parameters and hepatic lipid species were partly diminished by SIRT1 inhibition. In conclusion, our results suggested that SLBZS administration could effectively alter some hepatic lipid species in rats fed a high-fat diet, which was mainly associated with the regulation of glycerophospholipid and glycerolipid metabolism. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of SLBZS on hepatic lipid metabolism may be at least partly attributed to SIRT1 activation in the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647808>Causal relationships between obesity and the leading causes of death in women and men.</a></h2><p>Obesity traits are causally implicated with risk of cardiometabolic diseases. It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of obesity traits on other non-communicable diseases. Also, it is largely unexplored whether there are any sex-specific differences in the causal effects of obesity traits on cardiometabolic diseases and other leading causes of death. We constructed sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRS) for three obesity traits; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI, including 565, 324, and 337 genetic variants, respectively. These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the obesity traits and leading causes of mortality in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. We also investigated associations with potential mediators, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran's Q-test (Phet). A Mendelian randomization analysis of 228,466 women and 195,041 men showed that obesity causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type 2 and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic  disease, chronic  disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. Higher BMI led to higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men (Phet = 1.4×10-5). Waist-hip-ratio led to a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phet = 3.7×10-6) and higher risk of chronic renal failure (Phet = 1.0×10-4) in men than women. Obesity traits have an etiological role in the majority of the leading global causes of death. Sex differences exist in the effects of obesity traits on risk of type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure, which may have downstream implications for public health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689142>Changes in the composition of the human intestinal microbiome in alcohol use disorder: a systematic review.</a></h2><p>: A growing body of evidence highlights the role of the intestine in the development of various alcohol use disorder (AUD) complications.

By performing repeated MRI scans and blood analysis at day 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 the temporal changes in  fat and related metabolic factors were assessed at five times during a low-calorie diet (LCD, 800-1100 kcal/day) in ten obese non-diabetic women (BMI 41.7 ± 2.6 kg/m) whereof 6 had NAFLD. Mean weight loss was 7.4 ± 1.2 kg (0.7 kg/day) and  fat decreased by 51 ± 16%, resulting in only three subjects having NAFLD at day 28. Marked alteration of insulin, NEFA, ALT and 3-hydroxybuturate was evident 3 days after commencing LCD, whereas  fat showed a moderate but a linear reduction across the 28 days. Other circulating- fat markers (e.g. triglycerides, adiponectin, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 index, fibroblast growth factor 21) demonstrated modest and variable changes. Marked elevations of NEFA, 3-hydroxybuturate and ALT concentrations occurred until day 14, likely reflecting increased tissue lipolysis, fat oxidation and upregulated hepatic  acid oxidation.

The zeta potentials of the nanoparticles were negative and were -22 and -26 mV for Aq-bAgNPs and Et-bAgNPs, respectively. The antibacterial activity of bAgNPs was investigated against seven pathogenic (i.e., enteropathogenic ) and three nonpathogenic (i.e.,  DH5α,  K12, and ) bacteria at different time points (i.e., 12, 16, 20, and 24 h) in a dose-dependent manner (i.e., 20, 40, and 60 μg) through broth dilution assay, disk diffusion assay, CellTox Green uptake assay, and trypan blue dye exclusion assay. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration value for both the bAgNPs was 0.125 μg. Et-bAgNPs showed the highest antibacterial activity against  at 60 μg after 16 h and the diameter of inhibited zone was 28 mm.

Due to the epidemic obesity, NAFLD is representing a global health issue and the leading cause of  damage worldwide. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is closely related to insulin resistance (IR), adiposity and physical inactivity as well as genetic and epigenetic factors corroborate to the development and progression of hepatic steatosis and  injury. Emerging evidence has outlined the implication of gut microbiota and gut-derived endotoxins as actively contributors to NAFLD pathophysiology probably due to the tight anatomo-functional crosstalk between the gut and the . Obesity, nutrition and environmental factors might alter intestinal permeability producing a favorable micro-environment for bacterial overgrowth, mucosal inflammation and translocation of both invasive pathogens and harmful byproducts, which, in turn, influence hepatic fat composition and exacerbated pro-inflammatory and fibrotic processes. To date, no therapeutic interventions are available for NAFLD prevention and management, except for modifications in lifestyle, diet and physical exercise even though they show discouraging results due to the poor compliance of patients.

Patients with alcoholic  disease (ALD) have severe hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. Therapies for ALD are very limited and even abstinence from alcohol consumption does not necessarily protect patients from progression of the disease. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of a  X receptor (LXR) inverse agonist, SR9238, in an animal model of ALD. SR9238 suppresses hepatic lipogenesis, a pathological hallmark of ALD, and we hypothesized that targeting suppression of hepatic metabolic pathways that are activated in ALD may be an effective treatment for the disease. A chronic ethanol diet with or without a final ethanol binge treatment was used to induce ALD in mice. Mice were administered the  specific LXR inverse agonist SR9238 for 4 weeks after the mice had been maintained on the ethanol diet for 14 days. Mice developed all the hallmarks of advanced ALD demonstrating significant pathophysiology and hepatotoxicity. SR9238 significantly attenuated  injury and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis was nearly eliminated in SR9238 treated mice. SR9238 treatment reversed the damage associated with chronic ethanol use returning the  to near normal morphology. These results indicate that inhibiting LXR activity using the inverse agonist has a hepatoprotective effect in rodent models of ALD; thus, this pharmacological approach may be efficacious for treatment of ALD in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675349>The impact of Crocus sativus stigma against methotrexate-induced  toxicity in rats.</a></h2><p>Background The adverse effects of methotrexate (MTX) mainly hepatotoxicity restrict its clinical use. This study was designed to investigate the protective effects of saffron (Crocus sativus) (CS) extract on MTX-induced hepatotoxicity. Methods Twenty-eight male Wistar rats randomly divided into four equal groups. Except for control, all groups received a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of MTX on the 3rd day of study. The CS extract was given (80 mg/kg i.p.) to rats 3 days before MTX and continued for the next 7 days (Pre&Post-CS group) or administrated after MTX injection and lasted for 7 days (Post-CS group). On the 11th day, all rats were sacrificed and their plasma levels of  enzymes including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined. Also,  histopathology and hepatic levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and super oxidase dismutase (SOD) were evaluated. Results The results showed that MTX significantly incremented plasma levels of AST, ALT, ALP and LDH (all p<0.001) and hepatic MDA and NO levels; whereas, decreased SOD activity. Histological alterations such as early  changes were evident in the MTX group. Administration of CS extract at both methods could ameliorate  enzyme elevation, oxidative/nitrosative stresses and morphological alterations of the . Pre-and-post treatment with CS extract showed better protective effects than only post-treatment. Conclusion The present findings provide showing CS could effectively alleviate MTX-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.

Biochemical analysis showed that the aminotransferase (ALT) (P < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P < 0.001) and bilirubin (P < 0.01) statistically decreased after the drug treatment, but alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (P > 0.05) and glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) (P > 0.05) did not decrease. 29/31 patients' abnormal blood ammonia recovered. The risk factor of ALT on hospitalization time was significantly related (P < 0.01).The drugs above are sufficient to rescue functional loss in DMAc-induced toxic hepatitis, in part via the regulations of ALT, AST, LDH, bilirubin and ammonia. Workers with the exposure to DMAc should receive specific drugs to maintain the health and prevent functional loss in the long term.© The Author(s) 2019.

Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was estimated from bioimpedance analysis measurements, and the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) was calculated by dividing the sum of ASM by body weight. Sarcopenia was defined as a gender-specific SMI value > 2 standard deviations (SDs) below the mean for healthy young adults. NAFLD was defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis on ultrasonography with no other causes of chronic  disease.Among the entire study population (mean age: 57.4 ± 10.8 years), 1278 (30.4%) had NAFLD and 1240 (29.5%) had sarcopenia, and the prevalence of NAFLD was significantly higher in those with sarcopenia: 46.2% vs 25.1% (P < 0.001) in men; 38.3% vs 25.4% (P < 0.001) in women. Sarcopenia was significantly associated with higher risk of NAFLD in men [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-2.17], whereas the association was attenuated in women after adjusting for clinical risk factors.Sarcopenia is independently associated with NAFLD in men with T2DM, which suggests that sarcopenia may be a risk factor for NAFLD in men with T2DM.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The aim of this project was to investigate if stimulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation by the mitochondrial-targeted compound 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) would influence metabolites of the Trp-Kyn-NAD pathway. We wished to investigate how carnitine depletion by meldonium-treatment influenced these metabolites. After dietary treatment of male Wistar rats with 1-triple TTA for three weeks, increased hepatic mitochondrial- and peroxisomal  acid oxidation resulted. The plasma content of total carnitines decreased compared to control animals, whereas hepatic genes involved in CoA biosynthesis were upregulated by 1-triple TTA treatment. The plasma Trp level and individual metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were increased by 1-triple TTA, associated with decreased hepatic gene expression of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase. 1-triple TTA treatment increased conversion of Trp to nicotinamide (Nam) as the plasma content of quinolinic acid, Nam and N1-methylnicotinamide (mNam) increased, accompanied with suppression of hepatic gene expression of α-amino-α-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase. A positive correlation between mitochondrial  acid oxidation and Trp-derivatives was found. Almost identical results were obtained by 1-triple TTA in the presence of meldonium, which alone exerted minor effects. Moreover, the plasma Kyn:Trp ratio (KTR) correlated negatively to mitochondrial function. Whether increased flux through the Trp-NAD pathway increased redox status and lowered inflammation locally and systemically should be considered.Copyright © 2019.

The early identification of high-risk individuals is the key for halting these conditions. The world is facing a growing epidemic MetS although the magnitude in Egypt is unknown.  To describe MetS and its determinants among apparently healthy individuals residing in urban and rural communities in Egypt and to establish a model for MetS prediction.  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt. Participants were clinically evaluated and interviewed for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary habits. MetS was defined according to the harmonized criteria set by the AHA/NHLBI. The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and  were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and . Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were obesity [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid obesity [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (5.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (2.23-8.61)]. Consumption of caffeine once per week protected against MetS by 27.8-fold. The derived prediction rule was accurate in predicting MetS, , high risk of DM, and, to a lesser extent, a 10-year lifetime risk of IHD.  Central obesity and sedentary lifestyles are accountable for the rising rates of MetS in our society.

In , genetic or acquired impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can reduce ATP output but also decrease  acid oxidation, thus leading to different hepatic lesions including massive necrosis and microvesicular steatosis. Hence, a severe impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can lead to  failure and death. An increasing number of investigations report that some drugs can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and drug-induced  injury (DILI) by altering mtDNA homeostasis. Some drugs such as ciprofloxacin, antiretroviral nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and tacrine can inhibit hepatic mtDNA replication, thus inducing mtDNA depletion. Drug-induced reduced mtDNA levels can also be the consequence of reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative damage to mtDNA, which triggers its degradation by mitochondrial nucleases. Such mechanism is suspected for acetaminophen and troglitazone. Other pharmaceuticals such as linezolid and tetracyclines can impair mtDNA translation, thus selectively reducing the synthesis of the 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins. Lastly, some drugs might alter the mtDNA methylation status but the pathophysiological consequences of such alteration are still unclear. Drug-induced impairment of mtDNA homeostasis is probably under-recognized since preclinical and post-marketing safety studies do not classically investigate mtDNA levels, mitochondrial protein synthesis and mtDNA oxidative damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free  acids (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the  and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction.

To evaluate the anti-diabetic effects of insoluble- (BIF) and soluble fibers (BSF) enzymatically isolated from barley, a conventional rat model and a type 2 diabetes rat model were used. Our results showed that 4-week treatment of BIF or BSF effectively reduced FBG in the diabetic condition, with caecal level of propionic acid and minor SCFAs increased by BIF and that of butyric acid and insulin sensitivity improved by BSF, respectively. The two treatments further ameliorated  function, judged by the recovered serum level of ALT, albumin and total protein levels. BIF and BSF also increased HDL-C and decreased serum MDA. In normal rats, BIF and BSF showed a hypolipidaemic effect in triglycerides and LDL-C, reduced body weight and enhanced the caecal production of minor SCFAs. Furthermore, the two treatments reduced the caecal level of butyric acid while BSF increased that of propionic acid. In conclusion, BIF could exert anti-diabetic effects that might via a different mechanism from BSF.Copyright © 2019.

Thus, here, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis on NAFLD prevalence in the lean or nonobese population to give clarity.PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to identify studies reporting NAFLD prevalence in the lean/nonobese population. Lean or nonobese was defined by body mass index cutoffs reported by authors in original studies. NAFLD prevalence based on community, population, or health checkups was combined with random-effect model after logit transformation. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were further performed to investigate the heterogenicity.A total of 45 studies were enrolled in the final analysis, with 55,936 lean/nonobese subjects included, among whom 7351 NAFLD patients were diagnosed. Overall, the pooled NAFLD prevalence of the lean or nonobese population was 10.2% (95% confidence interval: 7.6%-13.6%) and 15.7% (95% confidence interval: 12.5%-19.6%), respectively. Compared with western studies, the NAFLD prevalence in the lean or nonobese population was lower in eastern studies. In addition, the NAFLD prevalence in both the lean and nonobese population showed a general upward trend during recent years. The prevalence was similar in community-based and health checkup-based studies. Lean/nonobese NAFLD patients had significantly lower rates of hypertension, lower uric acid and fasting plasma glucose, and a higher level of high-density lipoprotein than nonlean/obese patients.The prevalence of NAFLD in the lean/nonobese population is not rare in either the western or eastern regions of the world.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most serious form of NAFLD where inflammation causes  damage that can progress to cirrhosis. We have characterized the gut microbiome composition in UK patients with biopsy-proven NASH (n = 65) and compared it to that in healthy controls (n = 76). We report a 7% lower Shannon alpha diversity in NASH patients without cirrhosis (n = 40) compared to controls ( = 2.7x 10) and a 14% drop in NASH patients with cirrhosis (n = 25,  = 5.0x 10). Beta diversity (Unweighted UniFrac distance) was also significantly reduced in both NASH ( = 5.6x 10) and NASH-cirrhosis ( = 8.1x 10) groups. The genus most strongly associated with NASH in this study was  (0.29% abundance in controls, 3.45% in NASH without cirrhosis (False Discovery Rate (FDR)  = .008), and 4.38% in NASH with cirrhosis (FDR  = .02)). This genus, which has been linked previously to obesity and atherosclerosis, was also positively correlated with fasting levels of triglycerides ( = .01) and total cholesterol ( = 1.2x 10) and negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( = 2.8x 10) suggesting that some of the pathways present in this microbial genus may influence lipid metabolism in the host.

The aim of this study was to investigate how the addition of fruit and leaves to high-fructose diet affects lipid metabolism, including the expression of genes involved in  acid synthesis and oxidation in the  and adipose tissue, as well as oxidative stress and inflammation in Wistar rats. The animals were fed with AIN-93G diet, high fructose (HFr) diet, HFr diet with addition of 5% or 10% freeze-dried fruits, and HFr diet with addition of 1% or 3% freeze-dried leaves. The experiment lasted 12 weeks. The results showed that the intake of fruit and leaves of sweet cherry caused the improvement of the  function, as well as beneficially affected lipid metabolism, among others, by regulating the expression of genes associated with  acid synthesis and β-oxidation. Additionally, they exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In conclusion, the addition of fruit and leaves reduced the adverse changes arising from the consumption of high fructose diet. Therefore, not only commonly consumed fruits, but also leaves can be potentially used as functional foods.

In this study, the hypolipidemic effects of RO and its active compounds were clarified. The results showed that RO, rosmarinic acid (RA) and carnosic acid (CA) significantly reduced the contents of  triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), free  acids (FFA) and improved cell hypertrophy, vacuolation, and cell necrosis in the  of orotic acid induced non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) model rats. The mechanism and related pathways of RO and its main metabolites against lipid disorder were related to the up-regulation of the phosphorylation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate(AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the inhibition of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) cracking into the nucleus, following the down-regulation of  acid synthesis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that RA and CA are active substances of RO, and provides scientific evidence to support functional food product development for improving NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695254>A Novel Phosphoinositide-3-kinase Adapter Protein 1 Gene Missense Mutation in Familial Cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Familial cirrhosis is a condition that is associated with the presence of  disease with genetic linkage among multiple family members in a generation or in multiple generations.

The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of its role in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).NAFLD mouse models were established by using eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or (and) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 weeks. From the beginning of HFD, HFD-induced mice were subjected to amlexanox or vehicle for 18 weeks. HFD+LPS-induced mice were treated with amlexanox or vehicle for the last 6 weeks. Blood biochemistry parameters were determined using automatic biochemistry analyzer. Histological changes of  tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and Oil Red O staining. The expressions of IKKε and smooth muscle actin-α (α-SMA) were evaluated through immunohistochemistry. Serum inflammatory mediator was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene expressions involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway were examined using quantitative RT-PCR or Western blotting.This study demonstrated that amlexanox reversed glucose and lipid metabolic disturbance and hepatic steatosis in NAFLD mice model. IKKε was specific expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) instead of hepatocytes. This study also found that amlexanox improved insulin signaling (Insulin-IRS-1-Akt) in hepatocytes through inhibiting inflammation (IKKε-NF-κB-TNF-α/IL-1α) in HSCs.The present study confirmed that IKKε was specific expressed in HSCs. Inhibition of activated HSCs was responsible for effects of amlexanox on NAFLD, with improving insulin signal pathway in hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Choline and methionine (Met) can promote energy balance and benefit  health in transition dairy cows; however, the regulating mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we established the hepatocyte damage model by 1.5 mM NEFAs or BHBA treatment, and examined lipid metabolism in hepatocytes. The results showed that 1.5 mM NEFAs and 1.5 mM BHBA significantly decreased the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α as well as its target genes carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT-1α), acetyl-CoA carboxylase,  acid synthetase, and Apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100). Choline and Met upregulated the phosphorylation level of AMPK-α, which was blocked by BML (an AMPK-α inhibitor). The mRNA expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), CPT-1α, and ApoB100 showed a similar trend. The expressions of  X recptoer α (LXR-α) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) were decreased by choline and Met, while only the decrease of LXR-α was blocked by BML. These findings indicate that the high-level NEFAs and BHBA weaken the lipid metabolism by impairing the  acid oxidation, synthesis, and transport proteins. Choline and Met regulate PPAR-α and LXR-α transcriptional activity through AMPK-α phosphorylation and regulate SREBP-1c independently of AMPK-α to promote lipid oxidation and transport in NEFAs-treated hepatocytes.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658974>Economic and Clinical Burden of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes in the United States.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive form of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Patients with both T2DM and NASH have increased risk for adverse clinical outcomes, leading to higher risk for mortality and morbidity. We built a Markov model with 1-year cycles and 20-year horizon to estimate the economic burden of NASH with T2DM in the U.S.Cohort size was determined by population size, prevalence of T2DM, and prevalence and incidence of NASH in 2017. The model includes 10 health states: NAFL, NASH-fibrosis stages 0-3, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 year post- transplant, post- transplant, and -related, cardiovascular, and background mortality. Transition probabilities were calculated from meta-analyses and literature. Annual costs for NASH and T2DM were taken from literature and billing codes.We estimated that there were 18.2 million people in the U.S. living with T2DM and NAFLD, of which 6.4 million had NASH. Twenty-year costs for NAFLD in these patients were $55.8 billion. Over the next 20 years, NASH with T2DM will account for 65,000 transplants, 1.37 million cardiovascular-related deaths, and 812,000 -related deaths.This model predicts significant clinical and economic burden due to NASH with T2DM over the next 20 years. In fact, this burden may be greater since we assumed conservative inputs for our model and did not increase costs or the incidence of T2DM over time. It is highly likely that interventions reducing morbidity and mortality in NASH patients with T2DM could potentially reduce this projected clinical and economic burden.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695251>Molecular and Pathological Events Involved in the Pathogenesis of Diabetes-Associated Nonalcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus is a rising epidemic in most part of the world and is often associated with multiple organ disorders such as kidney, , and cardiovascular diseases.  is a major metabolic hub, and the metabolic disorders associated with diabetes result in  dysfunctions culminating in spectrum of  diseases such as  disorders, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Although obesity is a known risk factor for NAFLD, individuals with normal body mass index (BMI) also have hepatic  infiltration, now termed "lean-NAFLD". It represents a distinct entity with a strong underlying genetic component. The present study aimed to sequence the complete exonic regions of individuals with lean-NAFLD to identify germline causative variants associated with disrupted hepatic  acid metabolism, thereby conferring susceptibility to NAFLD.Whole blood was collected from patients with lean-NAFLD (n = 6; BMI < 23.0 kg/m) and matched lean controls (n = 2; discovery set).  fat was assessed using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging. Patients with ultrasound-detected NAFLD (n = 191) and controls (n = 105) were part of validation set. DNA was isolated, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in the discovery cohort (Ion Proton™; Ion AmpliSeq™ Exome RDY Kit). Data were analyzed (Ion Reporter software; Life Technologies), and variants identified. Validation of variants was carried out (Taqman probes; Real time-PCR). Student's t test and Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the statistical significance.Although WES identified ∼74,000 variants in individual samples, using various pipelines. variants in genes namely phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) and oxysterol-binding protein-related protein10 (OSBPL10) that have roles in dietary choline intake and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, respectively, were identified (discovery set). Furthermore, significant differences were noted in BMI (p = 0.006), waist/hip circumference (p > 0.001), waist/hip ratio (p > 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (p > 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (p > 0.001), and triglycerides (p = 0.002) between patients and controls. Validation of variants (rs7946-PEMT and rs2290532-OSBPL10) revealed that variant in PEMT but not OSBPL10 gene was associated (p = 0.04) with threefold increased risk of NAFLD in lean individuals.Our results demonstrate the association of rs7946 with lean-NAFLD.

Acots in the mitochondrial matrix are poised to mitigate β-oxidation overload and maintain CoA availability. Several Acots associate with mitochondria, but whether they all localize to the matrix, are redundant, or have different roles is unresolved. Here, we compared the suborganellar localization, activity, expression, and regulation among mitochondrial Acots (Acot2, 7, 9, and 13) in mitochondria from multiple mouse tissues and from a model of Acot2 depletion. Acot7, 9, and 13 localized to the matrix, joining Acot2 that was previously shown to localize there. Mitochondria from heart, skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue, and kidney robustly expressed Acot2, 9, and 13; Acot9 levels were substantially higher in brown adipose tissue and kidney mitochondria, as was activity for C4:0-CoA, a unique Acot9 substrate. In all tissues, Acot2 accounted for about half of the thioesterase activity for C14:0-CoA and C16:0-CoA. In contrast,  mitochondria from fed and fasted mice expressed little Acot activity, which was confined to long-chain CoAs and due mainly to Acot7 and Acot13 activities. Matrix Acots occupied different functional niches, based on substrate specificity (Acot9 vs. Acot2 and 13) and strong CoA inhibition (Acot7, 9, and 13, but not Acot2). Interpreted in the context of β-oxidation, CoA inhibition would prevent Acot-mediated suppression of β-oxidation, while providing a release valve when CoA is limiting. In contrast, CoA-insensitive Acot2 could provide a constitutive syphon for long-chain  acyl-CoAs. These results reveal how the family of matrix Acots can mitigate β-oxidation overload and prevent CoA limitation.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673703>Glucagon-Receptor Signaling Reverses Hepatic Steatosis Independent of Leptin Receptor Expression.</a></h2><p>Glucagon (GCG) is an essential regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism that also promotes weight loss. We have shown that glucagon-receptor (GCGR) signaling increases  acid oxidation (FAOx) in primary hepatocytes and reduces  triglycerides in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this aspect of GCG biology remains unclear. Investigation of hepatic GCGR targets elucidated a potent and previously unknown induction of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression.  leptin signaling is known to increase FAOx and decrease  triglycerides, similar to glucagon action. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucagon increases hepatic LEPR, which is necessary for glucagon-mediated reversal of hepatic steatosis. Eight week-old control and -specific, LEPR-deficient mice (LeprΔ) were placed on a high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated with a selective GCGR agonist (IUB288) for 14 days.  triglycerides and gene expression were assessed in  tissue homogenates. Administration of IUB288 in both lean and DIO mice increased hepatic Lepr isoforms a-e in acute (4h) and chronic (72h,16d) (p<0.05) settings. LeprΔ mice displayed increased hepatic triglycerides on a chow diet alone (p<0.05), which persisted in a DIO state (p<0.001), with no differences in body weight or composition. Surprisingly, chronic administration of IUB288 in DIO control and LeprΔ mice reduced  triglycerides regardless of genotype (p<0.05). Together these data suggest that GCGR activation induces hepatic Lepr expression and although hepatic glucagon and leptin signaling have similar  lipid targets, these appear to be two distinct pathways.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Vitamin E is recommended for treatment of NASH in the general population. However, its safety and efficacy among HIV-infected patients remain unknown.Single centre, phase IV, open-label, single arm clinical trial.HIV mono-infected patients without significant alcohol intake or viral hepatitis coinfection were included.

Participants were treated with 800 IU daily of oral vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) for 24 weeks, and followed for an additional 24 weeks post-discontinuation. Generalized linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate changes in ALT, CAP and CK-18 at the completion of treatment and end of follow-up, controlling for pre-treatment trends.A total of 27 patients were included.

Previous studies based on high-dose exposures indicate their hepatotoxicity. However, their mechanisms of toxicity or adverse outcome pathways and health risks remain largely unknown.This study aimed to evaluate metabolic consequences of chronic dietary exposure to SCCPs at low doses and reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatotoxicity of SCCPs.A combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics, together with general pathophysiological tests were performed to assess the hepatic response of male rats exposed to SCCPs.Our results highlight two major modes of action: Inhibition of energy metabolism and activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Exposure to SCCPs suppressed oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and turnover of ATP-ADP-AMP and thus results in deficiencies of amino acids and nucleotides in  of the rat. Exposure to SCCPs affected expression levels of 13 genes downstream of PPARα that encode proteins associated with metabolism of  acids. As a result, peroxisomal and mitochondrial  acid β-oxidation, microsomal  acid ω-oxidation, and lipogenesis were accelerated.Results of this work strongly support the conclusion that low-dose exposure to SCCPs can result in adverse outcomes in the rat model. Significant SCCP-induced inhibition of energy metabolism occurs at environmentally relevant dosages, which suggests that SCCPs exhibit metabolic toxicity. Interactions of SCCPs with PPARα signaling pathway can explain the disruption of lipids and amino acids metabolism.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

We examined the effects of acute or chronic intraperitoneal treatment with PEA (20 μg·g body weight) on parameters related to food intake and its regulatory mechanisms, locomotor activity, glucose and lipid metabolism, and the possible involvement of transcription factors and clock genes on metabolic changes in the . Acute PEA treatment induced a decrease in food intake at 6 and 8 h post-injection, comparable to that observed in mammals. This PEA anorectic effect in goldfish could be mediated through interactions with leptin and NPY, as PEA increased hepatic expression of leptin aI and reduced hypothalamic expression of npy. The PEA chronic treatment reduced weight gain, growth rate, and locomotor activity. The rise in glycolytic potential together with the increased potential of glucose to be transported into  suggests an enhanced use of glucose in the  after PEA treatment. In addition, part of glucose may be exported to be used in other tissues. The activity of  acid synthase (FAS) increased after chronic PEA treatment, suggesting an increase in the hepatic lipogenic capacity, in contrast with the mammalian model. Such lipogenic increment could be linked with the PEA-induction of REV-ERBα and BMAL1 found after the chronic treatment. As a whole, the present study shows the actions of PEA in several compartments related to energy homeostasis and feeding behavior, supporting a regulatory role for this N-acylethanolamine in fish.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, Elovl4 may be particularly important in Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT; Thunnus thynnus) characterised by having high DHA to EPA ratios. The present study cloned and characterised both the function and expression of an elovl4 cDNA from ABT. The Elovl4 had an open reading frame of 915 base pairs encoding a putative protein of 304 amino acids. Alignment and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the Elovl4 isoform identified in the present study was an Elovl4b. Functional characterisation demonstrated that the Elovl4b enzyme had elongase activity towards all the polyunsaturated  acid (PUFA) substrates assayed. The ABT Elovl4b contributed to DHA biosynthesis by elongation of EPA and DPA to 24:5n-3, the latter being desaturated to 24:6n-3 by the action of fads2 (Δ6 desaturase). Additionally, the ABT Elovl4b has a role in the biosynthesis of very long-chain PUFA up to C, compounds of key structural roles in neural tissues such as eye and brain, which had high levels of elovl4b transcripts. Surprisingly, while the relative expression of fads2, required for the production of DHA from EPA, was increased in  of ABT fed a diet with reduced levels of EPA and DHA, expression of elovl4b was reduced. Results indicated that ABT has enzymes necessary for endogenous production of DHA from EPA and demonstrate that Elovl4b can effectively compensate for absence of Elovl2.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

HFF rats exhibited a significant increase in the gain of body weight, energy, and lipids compared to LF rats. HFF rats also showed hepatic insulin resistance, together with an increase in plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Hepatic lipids, triglycerides and cholesterol were higher in HFF rats, while a significant decrease in Stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was found in this tissue. A marked increase in the protein amount of complex I, concomitant to a decrease in its contribution to mitochondrial respiration, was found in HFF rats. Lipid peroxidation and Nitro-Tyrosine content, taken as markers of oxidative stress, as well as NADPH oxidase activity, were significantly higher in HFF rats, while the antioxidant enzyme catalase decreased in these rats. Myeloperoxidase activity and lipocalin content increased, while peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma decreased in HFF rats. The present results provide evidence that middle-aged rats show susceptibility to a short-term "Western diet", exhibiting altered redox homeostasis, insulin resistance, and early mitochondrial alterations in the .

However, lack of knowledge on how chemicals cause steatosis has prevented any large-scale assessment of the 80,000+ chemicals in current use. To address this gap, we mined a large, publicly available toxicogenomic dataset associated with 18 known steatogenic chemicals to assess responses across assays ( and ) and species (i.e., rats and humans). We identified genes that were differentially expressed (DEGs) in rat , rat , and human  studies in which rats or  primary cell lines were exposed to the chemicals at different doses and durations. Using these DEGs, we performed pathway enrichment analysis, analyzed the molecular initiating events (MIEs) of the steatosis adverse outcome pathway (AOP), and predicted metabolite changes using metabolic network analysis. Genes indicative of oxidative stress were among the DEGs most frequently observed in the rat  studies. , a pro-fibrotic gene, was down-regulated across these chemical exposure conditions.

Similarly, we found the predicted metabolite changes, such as increases of saturated and unsaturated  acids, conserved across the three systems. Analysis of the target genes associated with the MIEs of the current steatosis AOP did not provide a clear association between these 18 chemicals and the MIEs, underlining the multi-factorial nature of this disease.

Quantitative US is based on the analysis of the radiofrequency echoes detected by an US system, and it allows to calculate a backscatter coefficient or an attenuation coefficient or the sound speed. The estimation of the backscatter coefficient is rather cumbersome and requires the use of a phantom for addressing all sources of variability. Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) available on the FibroScan system (Echosens, France) measures the attenuation of the US beam. CAP is accurate in grading  infiltration-even though there is an overlap between consecutive grade of  steatosis-and the values are not influenced by  fibrosis. Several US manufacturers are developing or have already developed software for quantifying the attenuation of the US beam. Preliminary results show that proprietary technologies implemented in US systems seem more accurate than CAP for grading  steatosis.
