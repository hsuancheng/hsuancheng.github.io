<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24933989>[Serum metabolome by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in patients with ulcerative colitis and celiac disease].</a></h2><p>Metabolomics is the emerging science of measurement and analysis of metabolome--the complete set of low molecular weight compounds in a cell, tissue, organ or whole organism. One of the aims of metabolomics is to research the response of an organism to a pathophysiological insult by measuring the concentrations of small molecule metabolites in biofluids and tissues and its dynamics. Intestinal microbiota is most probably involved in the development and maintenance of autoimmune inflammation in ulcerative colitis and celiac disease. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC - MS) of serum generates comprehensive metabolic profiles, reflecting integrated human (systemic) and gut microbial metabolism which may be altered in disease states. The aim of this study was to investigate GC - MS-based serum metabolomic profiles in UC and CD patients. Serum metabolic profiles were collected from 75 individuals: 20 patients with mild-moderate active UC, 35 CD patients, and 20 healthy controls (HC). We characterized 84 serum metabolites by use GC-MS. 18 metabolites at least have a combined (human + microbial) origin. In serum of UC patients, phenylacetic acid (PAA), 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPAA), 3-indolylacetic acid (IAA), succinic acid (SA) and fumaric acid (FA) were the metabolites most prominently increased, whereas 3-phenylpropionic acid (PPA) was significantly decreased. Serum of CD patients showed significant increases in IAA,  (IPA), SA and FA. Increased serum levels of succinic acid suggest its possible damaging effect on intestinal mucosa especially in ulcerative colitis. Orally administered butyrate + inulin as supplement to mesalazine in UC or gluten free diet in CD was effective in reducing disease activity with a marked improvement of serum metabolomic profiles (including SA reduction) and gut microbiota in both diseases. There were no any adverse events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490564>[Studies on biotransformation of chemical constituents of tongmai formula by human intestinal flora].</a></h2><p>To study the chemical constituents in Tongmai formula (TMF) after biotransformation by human intestinal flora (HIF), water extract of TMF was anaerobically incubated with HIF at 37 degrees C. Column chromatographic methods over silica gel, Sephadex LH-20 and semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography as well as recrystallization were used to isolate and purify the chemical constituents in TMF after biotransformation by HIF. The chemical structures of isolated compounds were identified on the basis of MS and NMR data. Twenty-six compounds were obtained and identified as phenylpropionic acid (1), 6"-O-acetylpuerarin (2), formononetin(3), daidzein(4), p-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (5),  (6), genistein (7), isoformononetin (8), isoononin (9), a mixture of (-)-puerol B-2"-O-glucopyranoside (10a) and (+) -puerol B-2"-O-glucopyranoside (10b), 8-hydroxydaidzein (11), puerol A (12), 3'-methoxy-6"-O-acetylpuerarin (13), 6"-O-acetyldaidzin (14), 3'-methoxydaidzin (15), puerol B (16), 3-methyluracil (17), genistin (18), daidzin (19), 3'-methoxypuerarin (20), mirificin (21), swertiamarin (22) , daidzein-7, 4'-O-glucoside (23), adenine (24), 3'-hydroxypuerarin (25), and puerarin (26). After biotransformation by HIF, the glycosides in TMF were transformed into aglycone and/or less glycosyl compounds along with some hydroxylation and demethylation reactions. Therefore, the glycosides in the TMF are the pro-drug.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612852>Clinical association between the metabolite of healthy gut microbiota,  and chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence indicates that gut microbiota serves an important role in the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Changes to the gut microbial flora can cause the generation of uremic toxins, which contribute to chronic kidney injury. The aim of the current study was to explore the clinical association between metabolites and CKD.Between August 2013 and January 2015, a two-phase case-control study was conducted to analyze the clinical association between metabolites and CKD in a community health program. The first phase of the study was a prospective case-control survey designed for comparing the differences in the metabolome profile of patients with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) rapid decline (a yearly decline >20%). The second phase of the study was a cross-sectional case-control study, which checked and compared the metabolites, indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate levels between healthy subjects (n = 144) and CKD patients (n = 140).In the first phase of the study, it was revealed that IPA levels of patients with rapid renal function decline were significantly reduced compared with the control patients (n = 10 for each group). The second phase furthered checked and compared the IPA, indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate levels between healthy subjects (n = 144) and CKD patients (n = 140). The results showed that the average level of indoxyl sulfate (2738.2 vs. 541.0 ng/ml, P < 0.01) and p-cresol sulfate (1442.8 vs. 1394.6 ng/ml, P < 0.01) were significantly higher in the CKD patients, while the average level of IPA was significantly higher (49.8 vs. 34.7 ng/ml, P < 0.01) in the control patients.Our results suggest that IPA might be an important biomarker and renal protector against the development of CKD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Intermediary metabolism is influenced by the intestinal microbiome. To test the hypothesis that PBDEs reduce host-beneficial intermediary metabolites in an intestinal microbiome-dependent manner, 9-week old male conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mice were orally gavaged once daily with vehicle, BDE-47, or BDE-99 (100 mol/kg) for 4 days. Intestinal microbiome (16S rDNA sequencing), liver transcriptome (RNA-Seq), and intermediary metabolites in serum, liver, as well as small and large intestinal contents (SIC and LIC; LC-MS) were examined. Changes in intermediary metabolite abundances in serum, liver, and SIC, were observed under basal conditions (CV vs. GF mice) and by PBDE exposure. PBDEs altered the largest number of metabolites in the LIC; most were regulated by PBDEs in GF conditions. Importantly, intestinal microbiome was necessary for PBDE-mediated decreases in branched-chain and aromatic amino acid metabolites, including , a tryptophan metabolite recently shown to be protective against inflammation and . Gene-metabolite networks revealed a positive association between the hepatic glycan synthesis gene -1,6-mannosyltransferase (Alg12) mRNA and mannose, which are important for protein glycosylation. Glycome changes have been observed in patients with metabolic syndrome. In LIC of CV mice, 23 bacterial taxa were regulated by PBDEs. Correlations of certain taxa with distinct serum metabolites further highlight a modulatory role of the microbiome in mediating PBDE effects. In summary, PBDEs impact intermediary metabolism in an intestinal microbiome-dependent manner, suggesting that dysbiosis may contribute to PBDE-mediated toxicities that include metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p></html>
